# Step 1 #
##########

Initialize Schema by running openalex-pg-schema.sql

Example code snippet

psql -d openalex -f openalex-pg-schema.sql-d openalex -f openalex-pg-schema.sql

# Step 2 #
##########

Convert JSON Files to flat CSV

Run flatten-openalex-jsonl.py. This script assumes that you are reading from file './openalex-snapshot'
and want to write into './csv-files'. Can be changed in the script (but will need to be changed for subsequent
scripts). This could potentially take several hours so best to run it in nohup.

HINT: by copying the script you can run conversions in parallel which could reduce the time to complete. This
can be done by commenting out the functions in the __main__() function at the bottom of the script. Then simply
run the scripts simultaneously.

Example code snippet

nohup python3 flatten-openalex-jsonl.py &

# Step 3 #
##########

Load flat CSVs to Database

Run copy-openalex-csv.sql to copy each csv-file subfolder into the appropriate table. This assumes that
you are running it from the folder directly above the csv-files/ subfolder. If you changed the name you
will have to change the location in each instance of the copy script. If you are loading e.g. works objects
it will take several hours and so it is HIGHLY recommended to nohup it.

Example code snippet

nohup psql -d openalex < copy-openalex-csv.sql &
