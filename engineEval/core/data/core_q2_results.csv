infrastructure development to support its billion plus population requires vast amounts of

herein, amine-functionalized metal-organic framework (mof) is introduced as one of the lowtemperature adsorbents. amine functionalization of their pore surfaces has been studied extensively to enhance the co2 uptake of mofs and amine-functionalized mofs have been synthesized via postsynthetic modifications in general. in this thesis, a one-step construction of a mof ([(nilethylamine)(bpdc)] = mofnh2; [nilethylamine]2+ = [ni(c12h32n8)]2+; bpdc2- = 4,4`-biphenyldicarboxylate) possessing covalently tethered alkylamine groups without post-synthetic modification was introduced. in order to investigate the effect of amino groups for co2, an isostructural mof with propyl pendant chain ([(nilpropyl)(bpdc)] = mofch3; [nilpropyl]2+ = [ni(c14h34n6)]2+) was provided. unlike mofch3 showing decrease co2 uptake as increasing temperatures, mofnh2 showed enhanced co2 uptake at elevated temperatures, attributed to active chemical interactions between the amine groups and the co2 molecules. due to the narrow channels of mofnh2, the accessibility to the channel of co2 is the limiting factor in its sorption behavior and only crystal size reduction of mofnh2 led to much faster and greater co2 uptake at low pressures. the chemical interaction between the primary amine chains tethered to the macrocyclic complex and co2 molecules resulted in the formation of ammonium carbamate, which was reversibly dissociated at mild temperatures, 100 oc, by releasing co2 molecules. mofnh2 was found to be one of lowtemperature adsorbents with good stability over repeated cycling. 



in addition, lithium orthosilicate (li4sio4) is studied as one of high-temperature absorbents. among some high-temperature absorbents, li4sio4 is lighter and has excellent theoretical capacity (36.7 wt%). above all, it operates at relatively lower regeneration temperature (~750 oc), which leads to active investigations in recent. here, the optimal method for synthesizing pristine lithium orthosilicate (p-li4sio4) with excellent properties was found by changing various factors and the way to treat the precursors is important to have better sorption properties of p-li4sio4. also, lithium metasilicate (li2sio3) and potassium carbonate (k2co3) as additives can help to improve the sorption properties of p-li4sio4. the optimal amount and location of additives were investigated and their roles were also studied by relating to the mechanism of co2 absorption for p-li4sio4.ope",graduate school of unist,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2151'],"[{'name': 'Kim, Yun Kyeong'}]",low- and high-temperature solid sorbents for carbon capture and storage (ccs),2015,,

project database. the screening found 640 materials that could be potentially implemented in high temperature carbonate looping; the materials were subsequently ranked by the theoretical energy penalty associated with their use. the most promising candidates were synthesised and subjected to thermogravimetric and diffraction studies to determine their experimental carbonation behaviour, showing good agreement with the screening results.
the second part describes a study of the  rst perovskite-type material shown to reversibly react with co2, ba4sb2o9. a combination of in situ thermogravimetric, diffraction and imaging techniques were used to characterise the structural evolution of the material and its stability upon repeated carbonation cycles. remarkably stable capacity retention over 100 cycles was found, a key improvement over currently used materials.
the  final part details the use of novel solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to study how ion dynamics influence the co2 absorption properties of alkali oxides. using measurements collected up to the high operating temperatures of these co2 capture materials, it was found at higher temperatures the li and o ionic dynamic processes are correlated, and the range of increased mobility coincides with the range over which co2

most of which use large volumes of water for cooling. population growth and climate
change are likely to increase water scarcity, whilst many countries are exploring
pathways to low-carbon electricity systems. thermal power stations, both with and
without carbon capture and storage (ccs), are likely to continue using water for cooling
where possible for the foreseeable future.
this thesis investigates the dependency on water for cooling of multiple low-carbon
pathways for the uk put forward by government and academia. an analytical
framework that combines generation technologies, cooling systems and sources, water
use factors and regional water availability is applied at national and regional scales.
whilst most decarbonisation pathways reduce freshwater use for a variety of reasons,
high levels of ccs are likely to increase freshwater demands due to the increased water
intensity of ccs generation. furthermore, higher demands will be locally concentrated,
given government’s strategy to cluster ccs facilities.
subsequently, ukcp09 weather generator climate timeseries and a hydrological model
of the river trent are used to simulate the effects of hydroclimatic variability on
licensed water availability. the impacts are tested on a ccs cluster operating with
different cooling systems and under two government-proposed abstraction regimes.
capacity availability is impacted by low flows, but this can be mitigated through
increased use of hybrid cooling and prioritisation of more water-efficient capacity.
other innovative solutions may reduce freshwater dependency, however these are not
facilitated by the current policy and regulatory arrangements. in some cases, reducing
water use and carbon emissions are in direct conflict. to ensure both energy and water
security, this thesis proposes strategies that take into account the planning of ccs
clusters, increasing competition for and scarcity of water, and the already challenging

(2) sensitivity study highlights that the cumulative oil production and cumulative co2 storage resource are very sensitive to crude oil price, co2 cost, project lifetime, discount rate and tax policy. high oil price, short project lifetime, low discount rate, low co2 cost, and low tax policy can greatly increase the net income of the oil enterprise, incremental oil recovery and co2 storage resource. (3) from this techno-economic evaluation, the major barriers to large-scale deployment of co2-eor include complex geological conditions, low api of crude oil, high tax policy, and lack of incentives for the co2-eor project",the authors. published by elsevier b.v.,"['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2610', 'https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/4786']","[{'name': 'Wei, Ning'}, {'name': 'Li, Xiaochun'}, {'name': 'Dahowski, Robert T.'}, {'name': 'Davidson, Casie L.'}, {'name': 'Liu, Shengnan'}, {'name': 'Zha, Yongjin'}]",economic evaluation on co2-eor of onshore oil fields in china ,2015,,['1750-5836']

neon isotope data are consistent with simple binary mixing between the injected and in situ natural gas. this relationship allows the ne isotope composition of the pre-injection gas in cranfield to be determined. coherent correlations between ne, he and ar isotopes allow the natural gas end-member composition to be calculated as well. the noble gas isotopic ratios (3he/4he = 0.05 ra, where ra is the atmospheric value of 1.39 x 10-6, 20ne/22ne = 9.62, 21ne/22ne = 0.0384, 40ar/36ar = 836 and 40ar*/4he = 0.09, where 40ar* is the sum of the radiogenic and mantle derived 40ar) of the natural gas in cranfield are typical of natural gases derived from the continental crust.

helium isotope ratios and the 40ar*/4he ratio notably correlate with co2 concentrations, indicating that the noble gas fingerprints of the injected gas are preserved, and may offer utility as a tracer of the co2. the he and ar isotope systematics of the four sampled wells that have the lowest co2 concentrations identify the loss of a significant amount of co2 from the free gas phase. the amount of loss in each of the four wells can be quantified from the measured 3he/4he and 40ar*/4he ratios and changes in the co2/3he values. losses vary between 22% and 96%, with good agreement between the different methods. it is notable however, that these four wells do not have significant gas production, and do not contribute significantly to the total amount of produced and re-injected gas. so, even though there is a significant loss from these wells, the total amount of co2 lost is estimated to be only ~0.1% of the total injected gas, equivalent to 10kt gas. notwithstanding this, the new data indicate that, across the entire field, co2 is retained as a free phase and stratigraphic trapping is the most important storage mechanism. the fractionation of 40ar*/4he, co2/3he and δ13cco2 in the co2-poor samples is consistent with dissolution in water.

the non-radiogenic noble gases (20ne, 36ar, 84kr, 132xe) originate from the atmosphere and are present in the gas, water and oil phases in the reservoir to differing degrees. it has been revealed that groundwater degassing, induced by co2 injection plays an important role in fractionating 20ne/36ar, 84kr/36ar and 132xe/36ar at the early stage of injection, but a large heterogeneity in the degree of degassing has been observed throughout the reservoir. some wells have shown 100% water degassing, while others are close to 0%. oil degassing, and therefore the active co2 – oil contact, became important during the later phase of injection, which is consistent with the fact that more co2 injection was required to degas the oil than water. temporal variations in the non-radiogenic noble gas ratios and 3he/4he are indicative of the evolution of the oil displacement efficiency. this fully agrees with the injection – production well data recorded in the field during sampling. this suggests that noble gases can also be used as a reservoir engineering tool to better understand the interaction of co2, water and oil in the subsurface not only during co2 storage but also to track eor operations",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/7745'],"[{'name': 'Gyore, Domokos'}]",noble gases as tracers of injected co2 in the cranfield enhanced oil recovery field,2015,,

alors que les cimenteries québécoises ont adopté les mesures les plus abordables pour améliorer leur bilan environnemental, des mesures plus poussées telles que la capture et séquestration du carbone requièrent un contexte réglementaire ou économique différent, comme un prix du carbone plus élevé. il est entre autres recommandé de déterminer des plafonds d’émission sur le marché du carbone pour la période post-2020 tout en continuant la distribution gratuite de droits d’émission aux cimenteries, ainsi que de poursuivre la recherche environnementale dans le domaine du ciment. il est aussi recommandé de favoriser la création de comités de citoyens pour favoriser l'acceptabilité sociale",universite de sherbrooke,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2140'],"[{'name': 'Pinel, Patrick'}]",perspectives d'amélioration du bilan environnemental des cimenteries québécoises,2015,,

ensure the delivery of secure, affordable energy in a
way that meets the emission reductions targets laid
out in the climate change act (2008). the epsrcfunded
transition pathways (tp) and, more recently,
realising transition pathways (rtp) projects have both argued that multiple logics of governance, ownership, and control of the electricity system can be followed to address the energy trilemma. this work has developed three transition pathways for the uk energy system, each driven by different governance patterns. each pathway has a specific technological mix, institutional architecture, and societal drivers. these pathways are:
central co-ordination: central to this pathway
is the role of the nation state in actively delivering the transition.
market rules: after the creation of a broad
policy framework, the state allows competition
and private companies to deliver sustainable,
affordable energy.
thousand flowers: this pathway is characterised by a greatly expanded role for civil society in delivering distributed low-carbon generation.
the following report focuses on the thousand
flowers pathway. there is growing interest, from a range of stakeholders, in the potential of distributed low-carbon electricity generation in delivering a low-carbon energy system. yet there are still significant gaps in understanding, particularly regarding the feasibility of scaling up
distributed generation from technological, governance, regulation, policy, and financial perspectives. the aim of this report is to address these gaps within the context of the thousand flowers pathway. this research was carried out by the ‘engine room’ of the epsrc-funded realising transition pathways (rtp) consortium. the ‘engine room’ was established to facilitate interdisciplinary work across the consortium
and consists of research fellows and doctoral
researchers from different fields in the nine partner
institutions. engine room workshops and meetings
give researchers the space to present their work
and develop and exchange ideas with their peers.
this report is an output of a series of interdisciplinary engine room workshops held throughout 2013/14 which also drew on contributions from energy industry stakeholders. these workshops brought together the current research and cumulative findings of the realising transition pathways consortium, to examine the consequences of a transition from a centralised energy system to one where distributed generation plays a much greater role (50% of final electricity demand), and is delivered by a civic energy sector. in this report we do not present any panaceas, attempt to preference a civil response to energy transition,
or claim technological infallibility. we do, however,
explore the potential of a distributed energy future and investigate the technological trajectory it could follow, along with an institutional architecture compatible with its development. we acknowledge throughout that this is a challenging but realistic system transition",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/66'],"[{'name': 'John Barton (1252113)'}, {'name': 'Damiete Emmanuel-Yusuf (7212314)'}, {'name': 'Stephen Hall (169258)'}, {'name': 'Victoria Johnson (826820)'}, {'name': 'Noel Longhurst (7215677)'}, {'name': ""Aine O'Grady (7212311)""}, {'name': 'Elizabeth M.

developing technologies for reducing the emission of co2 in the atmosphere. carbon
dioxide capture and storage (ccs) is one of the most promising technologies that can
eliminate/reduce global warming, helping the world to move towards a low-carbon
society. the process comprises of the separation of co2 from industrial sources,
transport to a storage location and then long-term isolation from the atmosphere. co2-
rich pipelines are a key part of any carbon capture and storage projects. modelling of
these types of pipelines are challenging due to the lack of thermo-physical properties of
co2 in presence of impurities. as these properties, particularly density and viscosity,
have a significant impact on the sizing of equipment, therefore, it is crucial to
investigate the impact of different impurities on the thermo-physical properties of co2-

densities and viscosities of pure co2, two co2 – h2 binary systems (with 5 and with 10
mol% h2), and 6 multi-component mixtures (mix 1 with 5 mol% impurity, mix 2 with
10 mol % impurity, mix 3 with 30 mol % impurity, mix 4 with 50 mol % impurity,
mix 5 with 4 mol % impurity and mix 6 with 30 mol % impurity) were measured at
pressures ranging from 10 to 1,400 bar (1 to 140 mpa) and six different temperatures, 0,

gas, liquid, and supercritical regions using an anton paar densitometer and capillary
tube technique for density and viscosity measurements, respectively. the experimental
density data then were applied to evaluate the models using co2 correction volume,
peneloux shift parameter and original equation of states (pr and srk). also, the
obtained viscosity data were employed to tune the correlative lohrenz-bray-clark
(lbc) and co2-lbc models and to evaluate the predictive models. the predictive
models in this work are based on corresponding states (cs) theory models. the “one
reference fluid” corresponding states model is based on the approach developed by
pedersen et al. and modified for co2-rich fluids; the “two reference fluids”
corresponding states models are based on the model proposed by aasberg-petersen
(cs2) and co2-cs2 models. two models based on the extended corresponding states
(ecs) theory, supertrap and co2-supertrap models were also tested.
the densities of 95%co2-5%h2s and 95%co2-5%so2 systems were measured
continuously using a high temperature and pressure vibrating tube densitometer
(vtd), anton paar dma 512 at pressures up to 400 bar (40 mpa) at five different

the study demonstrates the considerable potential for alternative price and regulatory drivers to encourage coal mine methane project developments. this is clear across the three scenarios considered (i.e., the existing market price scenario, the augmented price scenario, and a scenario that imposes a requirement for methane use/abatement to the extent that is technically feasible) as applied in this analysis to the three subject countries of germany, poland and the united kingdom.
the most significant potential impact that cmm industrial development brings is the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, which occurs under all three scenarios. the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions through policies to promote coal mine methane projects is also very favourable.
the use of cmm will also provide some enhanced domestic supply of an energy resource.  although cmm should not be viewed as a critical strategic energy resource to the eu as a whole, as its maximum expected input into the european grid systems of gas and electricity would be small compared to the overall respective market sizes and would have very small impacts on energy prices, the analysis in this study shows that full use of existing and future cmm resources can contribute considerably to the energy mix of the local regions.jrc.h.8-sustainability assessmen",european commission,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/961'],"[{'name': 'SCHULTZ Karl'}, {'name': 'ADLER Linus'}]",environmental and sustainability assessment of current and prospective status of coal mine methane production and use in the european union,2015,,

the overall aim of this thesis has been to demonstrate how the pulp and paper industry can help cut global greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions and increase revenues by efficient use of biomass via gasification. in this thesis, the impact of different end products and biomass pretreatment measures connected to integrated gasification processes were evaluated regarding efficiency, ghg emissions and economic performance.
the selection of end product from a gasification-based process (methanol, fischer-tropsch crude, synthetic natural gas or electricity, in this thesis) was demonstrated to significantly influence the required biomass input, if the sizing constraint was to replace heat production in the bark boiler. the size varied between approximately 200 mwbiomass and 600 mwbiomass. the selection of dryer type was shown to significantly impact the economic performance of a process despite its relatively low capital cost in relation to the total capital cost of 100 to 140 million euros. with the preconditions in this study, thermal pretreatment (torrefaction or pyrolysis) of biomass may be beneficial with biomass-to-biofuel efficiencies reaching 68%.
assumptions regarding the electricity production sector influence whether an integrated gasification process is better than a stand-alone unit and whether onsite co-generation of electricity should be prioritised in favour of increased yield of biofuels. sequestration of separated co2 has been shown to improve the climatic performance of a system and increase its competitiveness against, e.g., co-firing biomass in a coal power plant, by increasing the potential from approximately 300 kgco2,eq./mwhbiomass to 700 kgco2,eq./mwhbiomass. global ghg emission consequences are greatly affected by the assumed electricity production sector and selected end product","chalmers university of technology, göteborg",['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1213'],"[{'name': 'Isaksson, Johan'}]",biomass gasification-based biorefineries in pulp and paper mills – greenhouse gas emission implications and economic performance,2015,,

the european electricity sector will have to deal with a huge challenge in the decades
to come. on the one hand, electrical power is increasingly substituted for other
forms of energy. it has been forecast that electricity demand will increase in the
future (notably because of new needs in transport and heat sectors), although it is
currently stagnant, mainly because of the economic crisis. unless a major alternative
energy source is discovered, electricity will become the central energy pillar in the
long term. on the other hand, electricity production remains uncertain and will
depend on numerous factors: the growth of renewable energy and decentralized
energy, the renewal of old power generation capacities, increased external dependency,
co2 charges, etc. this increases the demand for electricity networks that are
more reliable, more efficient, and more flexible. europe’s current electricity
networks are ageing, and, as already indicated by the international energy agency,
many of them will need to be modernized or replaced in the decades to come.
finally, the growing impact of energy trading also needs to be taken into account.
these considerations explain the need to modernize the electric grid through various
ict means. this modernization alone may allow the grid to become more flexible and
interactive, to provide real time feedback, more adaptation to a fluctuating demand,
and finally to reduce the global electricity costs.
the paper begins with a description of the eu definition of the term ‘smart grid’ (§ 1)
and of the body in charge of advising the commission (§ 2). the eu legal framework
applicable to smart grids is also detailed (§ 3). it is a rather complex domain,
connected to various regulations. the paper then examines three critical factors in
the development of smart grids (and smart meters as a precondition). standardization
is quite complex, but absolutely essential (§ 4). innovation is not easily put into
action (§ 5). finally, as digital insecurity has worsened dramatically in recent years,
the security of electricity networks, and especially their multiplied electronic components,
will become increasingly important (§ 6). lastly, the paper provides a concise
overview of the progress of smart grids in the eu in recent years (§ 7). in a nutshell,
the conclusion is that progress is quite slow, many obstacles remain, and, given the
appearance of many new regulatory problems, it would be useful to organize a
review of the present eu strategy",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/213'],"[{'name': 'Zgajewski, Tania'}]","smart electricity grids: a very slow deployment in the eu. egmont paper no. 74, february 2015",2015,,

the paper further compares public opinions before and after the nuclear phase-out. the anti-nuclear movement can be largely characterized as a niaby (not in any backyard) movement with collectively resonating norms against it. in contrast, public attitudes after the phase-out are a combination of nimby-ism and resistance to specific projects without rejecting the overarching principle as a whole reflected in a majority of the german public polling in favour of the energiewende being relevant for the german population. of importance also is the role of perceived justice and fairness and the lack thereof could also lower public acceptance, especially in terms of distribution of the costs of the energiewende.
to this end, the paper concludes that while not currently of a scale comparable to the anti-nuclear movement, public opinions must nonetheless be engaged by the government through more transparent and collaborative decision making processes. while the german government is taking steps towards including the public more, most of its plans are still nascent and their efficacy remains to be assessed after they are implemented.nhhma",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1826'],"[{'name': 'Bennett, Theodor'}, {'name': 'Seal, Suryadeep'}]",nuclear shutdown to nimby-ism : an assessment of public attitudes before and after the nuclear phase-out in germany,2015,,

positional multiphase flow with equilibrium phase exchange. it is able to represent the

important process of solubility trapping. one of the big problems arising in two-phase

two-component flow simulations is the disappearance of the nonwetting phase, where the

saturation cannot be used as independent variable.

in this thesis, a persistent variable formulation is presented, which has the important

advantage that only one set of primary variables can be used for the biphasic as well as

the monophasic case. using a modified newton solver, also developed in the course of this

work, the convergence at the single-phase/two-phase interface can be greatly improved.

the persistent variable formulation is implemented in the dune simulation framework

with capillary pressure and nonwetting phase pressure as primary variables. the presented

method is verified by numerical test simulations of co2 injection in saline aquifers. a

fine grid resolution for these large-scale simulations can only be achieved by the use of

heavy parallelization. the numerical results for the recent momas benchmark agree with

the output of other groups. for several test cases, grid convergence and scalability are

integration of renewables: how should renewable energy sources best be integrated into grid and market to make renewable electricity production more responsive to system needs? how and at what costs can the increased need for flexibility of generation and energy demand be provided?

grid operations: is the traditional focus of networks well placed to fully accommodate the on-going process of energy transition and to provide the reliability of supply in a least-cost approach? how to improve cross-border cooperation? what can be learned from existing initiatives of regional and bilateral cooperation between grid operators and regulators? would common minimum standards for data quality from power plant operators help to create forecasts to optimise regional balancing power markets?

market design: in order to ensure the reliability of supply, what is the need of coordination in/between member states for balancing, re-dispatch and storage? how to improve the convergence of renewables support schemes? which role could european regional markets play in coordinated scenario building in view of asset optimisation?

recycling industrial waste materials such as ground granulated blast furnace slag
(ggbs) and pulverised fly ash (pfa), including avoiding the need to transfer such
materials to landfill, their abundant supply, negligible or zero production costs and for
calcium-bearing wastes such as slags, their recently determined potential for carbon
capture and storage (ccs).
this thesis presents recent laboratory research which focussed on the potential for
utilising alkali activated industrial waste materials as sustainable binders in ddsm to
enhance the geotechnical properties of soft soils. the laboratory testing programme
deployed geotechnical and mineralogical tests to determine the performance of the
binders when incorporated into a soft alluvial soil, typically found in abundance across
the uk.
comparisons with the strength and durability of untreated and stabilised soils have
been made. the study indicates that from the by-products tested, soils stabilised with
sodium hydroxide (naoh) activated ggbs resulted in the greatest strength and
durability improvements; with other materials tested showing smaller improvements.
the addition of naoh has been observed to allow pozzolanic reactions to occur,
leading to improved mechanical properties; primarily strength, which increased with
time.

secondary minerals to replace cement in stabilising an alluvium ii
the effectiveness of ddsm treatment in stabilising sections of high-speed railway
lines with ground conditions dominated by soft and highly compressible soils, has
previously been well demonstrated (holm et al., 2002; hughes and glendinning,
2004). traditionally, the monotonic strength properties of stabilised soils have been
used to assess their suitability for stabilising railway embankments. however, the
dynamic strength properties of such materials require investigation in order to provide
better estimates of their field behaviour when subjected to complex loading conditions
associated with high-speed railway embankments and high-frequency train traffic.
hence, this thesis combines monotonic and dynamic triaxial testing techniques to
assess the suitability of the new ggbs-naoh binder for stabilising high-speed
railway embankments. after 28 days curing, the binder successfully demonstrated
itself as an effective countermeasure against significant track displacements after the
simulated passage of a typical intercity 125 high-speed train.
this thesis advocates that there is great potential for using ggbs-naoh as a more
environmentally and financially sustainable binder over cem-i for ddsm projects in
the uk, such as the proposed hs2 and hs3 rail links. however, further research and
collaboration with the construction industry is still required before the new binder may
be used on a commercial scale.st. james’s investments (new bond street, london) for

institutional obstacles are at the core of this work. they can be identified either as formal obstacles, such as legal or administrative problems, or as informal obstacles, such as problems related to routines or established practices. traditionally, institutional obstacles have been considered either formal or informal. this dissertation challenges that conception and claims that often the most difficult obstacles are those that operate between the formal and the informal. operating in between disconnects formal (administrative) institutional reality from informal (operative) institutional reality. it is challenging, if not impossible, to develop formal rules or ways of doing things related to a particular issue once the connection related to that issue has been cut off, because formal and informal realities are structurally dependent on one another. 

at the same time the dissertation points out that once the disconnection has been identified, it is possible to reunite formal and informal realities. this can be done by means of an institutional feedback mechanism that fits the local circumstances. institutional feedback means maintenance of knowledge exchange between actors and groups of actors operating in different realities. in an industrial context, institutional feedback may, for example, enable the development of new kinds of recycling opportunities and continuous intensification of the materials  utilization. novel institutional feedback mechanisms may also offer new possibilities for overcoming obstacles in the development of recycling and the promotion of the circular economy in different sectors of society. 

this dissertation consists of four case studies that investigate the management of materials and other resources in industrial units located in the bothnian arc region of northern finland. the industrial units studied cover the fields of finland s traditional basic industries: the metal, wood-processing, and chemical industries. the primary data for this study consist of interview materials, questionnaires, and documentary sources. the main points of interest are two types of recycling: 1) the utilization of different leftover materials as replacements for existing products or as raw materials, and 2) the development of completely new kinds of recycling products and innovative recycling processes. both types are considered especially from the perspectives of institutional obstacles and feedback mechanisms aimed at overcoming the obstacles. 

the key result of this study is a theoretical presentation of the structure and functioning of an institutional feedback mechanism. to function in a complex operational environment, an institutional feedback mechanism should consist of two components: the production of the right kind of knowledge (knowledge networking) and the management and maintenance of a network of actors that are central to the specific aims (network governance). this dissertation shows different ways to identify, conceptualize, and study these two components of institutional feedback mechanisms. by means of an example, the study also demonstrates how an institutional feedback mechanism can be constructed and how it can be utilized to overcome practical problems and profound institutional obstacles. policy recommendations for the management of complex operational environments and for the promotion of a circular economy and material efficiency are also presented.kiertotalous on ajankohtainen aihe yhteiskuntapolitiikassa sekä yhteiskuntatieteellisessä ympäristötutkimuksessa. tässä väitöskirjassa tarkastellaan kriittisesti kiertotalouden kehittämiseen ja teollisuudessa tapahtuvan materiaalien kierrättämisen edistämiseen tähtääviä toimenpiteitä. työssä tunnistetaan sellaisia tekijöitä, jotka estävät tai hidastavat teollisen kierrätyksen kehittämistä sekä etsitään uudenlaisia ratkaisuja näiden esteiden ylittämiseksi. 

työn keskiössä ovat institutionaaliset esteet, jotka määritellään toisaalta muodollisiksi esteiksi eli esimerkiksi lainsäädännöstä johtuviksi hallinnollisiksi ongelmiksi ja toisaalta epämuodollisiksi esteiksi eli esimerkiksi vakiintuneista rutiineista ja toimintatavoista johtuviksi. perinteisen tulkinnan mukaan institutionaaliset esteet ovat ensisijaisesti joko muodollisia tai epämuodollisia. tämä työ haastaa perinteisen tulkinnan ja väittää, että usein vaikeimmat esteet ovat sellaisia, jotka operoivat muodollisten ja epämuodollisten esteiden välimaastossa. välimaastossa toimiminen katkaisee yhteyden muodollisen hallinnon todellisuuden ja epämuodollisen operatiivisen todellisuuden välillä. muodollinen ja epämuodollinen todellisuus ovat kuitenkin rakenteellisesti riippuvaisia toisistaan ja tämän vuoksi sääntöjärjestelmien tai epämuodollisten toimintatapojen asianmukainen kehittäminen on vähintäänkin haastavaa ellei mahdotonta tilanteessa, jossa yhteys todellisuuksien välillä on katkennut. 

samaan aikaan väitöskirja osoittaa, että sen jälkeen kun katkennut yhteys muodollisen ja epämuodollisen todellisuuden välillä on tunnistettu, on myös mahdollista luoda uusi yhteys. uuden yhteyden luominen voi tapahtua olosuhteisiin soveltuvan institutionaalisen palautemekanismin avulla. institutionaalinen palaute tarkoittaa tiedonvaihdon ylläpitoa eri todellisuuksissa toimivien ihmisten ja ihmisryhmien välillä. teollisuuden kontekstissa institutionaalinen palaute voi esimerkiksi mahdollistaa uudenlaisten kierrätystapojen kehittämisen sekä materiaalien hyödyntämiskäytäntöjen jatkuvan tehostamisen. innovatiivisella tavalla rakennetut institutionaaliset palautemekanismit voivat tarjota uudenlaisia mahdollisuuksia niiden esteiden ylittämiseen, joita materiaalien kierrättämisen kehittäminen ja kiertotalouden edistäminen jatkuvasti kohtaavat yhteiskunnan eri aloilla. 

väitöskirja koostuu neljästä tapaustutkimuksesta, jotka tarkastelevat teollisuudessa käytettävien materiaalien ja muiden resurssien hallintaa raskaan teollisuuden yksiköissä perämerenkaaren alueella pohjois-suomessa. käsitellyt teollisuusyksiköt kattavat suomalaisen perusteollisuuden perinteiset alat: metalli-, puunkäsittely- ja kemianteollisuuden. työn pääasiallinen aineisto koostuu haastattelumateriaaleista, kyselytutkimuksista sekä dokumenttiaineistoista. työssä ollaan erityisesti kiinnostuneita kahdenlaisesta kierrätystavasta: 1) erilaisten ylijäämämateriaalien hyödyntämisestä olemassa olevien tuotteiden korvaajina tai uusien tuotteiden raaka-aineina sekä 2) täysin uudenlaisten kierrätystuotteiden ja innovatiivisten kierrätysprosessien kehittämisestä. kumpaakin näistä kierrätystavoista tarkastellaan erityisesti institutionaalisten esteiden ja niiden ratkaisemiseen tähtäävien palautemekanismien näkökulmista. 

työn keskeisin tulos on teoreettisesti jäsennelty esitys institutionaalisen palautemekanismin rakenteesta ja toiminnasta raskaan teollisuuden kontekstissa. voidakseen toimia kompleksisessa toimintaympäristössä, institutionaalisen palautemekanismin tulee koostua kahdesta komponentista: oikeanlaisen tiedon yhteisöllisestä tuottamisesta (engl. knowledge networking) sekä tavoitteiden kannalta keskeisten toimijoiden verkoston hallinnasta (engl. network governance). työssä esitetään erilaisia tapoja näiden kahden komponentin tunnistamiseen, käsitteellistämiseen sekä tutkimiseen. esimerkin avulla havainnollistetaan myös sitä, kuinka institutionaalinen palautemekanismi voidaan luoda ja kuinka sen avulla voidaan ratkaista käytännöllisiä ongelmia sekä ylittää syvällisempiä institutionaalisia esteitä. työssä esitetään myös politiikkatoimenpiteitä kompleksisten toimintaympäristöjen hallinnan kehittämiseen sekä konkreettisia suosituksia kiertotalouden ja materiaalitehokkuuden edistämiseen",university of helsinki libraries,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/555'],"[{'name': 'Levänen, Jarkko'}]",overcoming the institutional obstacles of industrial recycling,2015,,

the exploratory project erebiland (european regional energy balance and innovation landscape) aims at supporting efficient patterns of regional energy supply and demand in europe. integration of spatial scales, from eu-wide to regional or local, and a cross-sector approach, are at the core of the project.
the approach is based on territorial disaggregation of information, and the development of optimisation scenarios at regional scale. it is centred around the land use-based integrated sustainability assessment (luisa) modelling platform for the assessment of policies and investments that have spatial impacts, in interaction with the jrc-eu-times model – a bottom-up, technology-rich model representing the eu28+ energy system – and the model rhomolo that integrates economic and some social dimensions of regional development.
based on currently operational and up-to-date tools available within the ec, the purpose of the erebiland project is to: 
•	provide an overview of the current trends of regional energy production and consumption patterns, and
•	link these patterns to the structural characteristics of the regions, among which: population density and urbanisation trends, development of different economic sectors, and availability of resources and technological infrastructure.
this report presents the outcomes of the erebiland project during its first year.
in particular, electricity generation and energy consumed by transport sector are analysed, under the eu energy reference scenario 2013, throughout the period 2015 - 2030.
main results of the analysis dedicated to the electricity generation are:
•	electricity generation from biomass increases in the large majority of european regions; a slight decrease can be found only in regions producing electricity already in 2015 above the eu28 average (in denmark).
•	electricity produced from biogas experiences less steep changes then biomass, with almost 50% of nuts2 decreasing or not changing considerably the amount of electricity produced from this source.
•	coal: electricity generated from lignite undergoes a significant reduction in all regions using this fuel already in 2015. conversely, trends in electricity generated from hard coal are more stable, with some regions experiencing an increase: the average change is higher than 50% (a few regions in eastern european countries), but steeper increases can be found in austria, sweden and the united kingdom.
•	the amount of electricity generated from gas generally decreases across europe from 2015 to 2030, with an average decrease higher than 90%.
•	geothermal is the least diffuse source used to generate electricity in europe and only few regions are represented.
•	hydroelectric: the amount of electricity generated from this source is in general forecasted to increase in europe from 2015 to 2030. exceptions are a few regions in bulgaria, czech republic, germany, spain, greece, hungary, portugal, romania, sweden and most nuts2 in the uk.
•	electricity generated from nuclear is forecasted to decrease in the majority of the regions with active nuclear power plants in 2015. 
•	oil: the majority of the regions generating electricity from this fuel in 2015, experience a decrease in 2030. notable exceptions are a few regions in austria, belgium, germany, greece, hungary, italy, poland and slovenia.
•	electricity produced from solar is forecasted to increase in almost three quarters of european regions. the only regions where electricity from solar is forecasted to decrease are located in greece and romania.
•	wind: electricity generated from wind, both on- and off-shore, is in general forecasted to increase in europe. the largest increases in electricity generated from on-shore wind (above 5 times the 2015 generation levels) can be found in few regions in czech republic, finland, lubuskie in poland, the north-est nuts2 in romania, western slovakia and slovenia.

main results of the analysis dedicated to energy consumption of the transport sector are:
•	in more than two thirds of european regions, the energy supplied to cars (fuel: diesel) decreases from 2015 to 2030, with an average decrease of almost 20%.
•	the energy supplied to cars (fuels: gas and lpg) is forecasted to decrease throughout all european regions. the decrease is more gradual in few regions in denmark, portugal, greece, spain and italy.
•	energy supplied to cars (fuel: gasoline) is forecasted to decrease in more than 80% of the european regions, with an average decrease of 27%.
•	the energy supplied to heavy duty trucks (fuel: diesel) is forecasted to progressively decrease from 2015 to 2030 in 66% of the european regions, with an average decrease of more than 8%.
•	the energy supplied to light duty trucks (fuel: diesel) is forecasted to steeply decrease throughout european regions.
•	the energy supplied to light duty trucks (fuel: gasoline) is forecasted to increase in more than 90% of european regions, with an average increase of more than 40% from 2015 to 2030. the highest increases (above 70%) take place in eleven regions in germany, walloon brabant in belgium, flevoland in the netherlands, lower austria and eastern macedonia and thrace. 
•	the energy supplied to inter-city buses running on diesel is forecasted to increase from 2015 to 2030 in the large majority of european regions, with an average increase of more than 19%.
•	the energy supplied to urban buses (fuels: gas, diesel and gasoline) is going to moderately increase from 2015 to 2030 in almost 90% regions throughout eu-28, with an average growth of 15%.
•	energy supplied to motorcycles (fuel: gasoline) is forecasted to increase in more than 80% of european nuts2, with an average growth of 16%.
•	energy supplied to cars (fuels: hybrid, electric and hydrogen) is forecasted to increase throughout europe, in general with sharp increases.
•	energy supplied to heavy duty trucks (fuel: gas) and light duty trucks (fuel: lpg) is forecasted to increase in all european regions from 2015 to 2020. in most nuts2 this trend is kept or even accelerates between 2020 and 2030. the only regions where the trend is reversed (lower energy supplied in 2030 compared to 2020) are located in poland, greece, finland (only åland) and croatia (only jadranska hrvatska).jrc.h.8-sustainability assessmen",publications office of the european union,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/961'],"[{'name': 'BARANZELLI CLAUDIA'}, {'name': 'LAVALLE CARLO'}, {'name': 'SGOBBI ALESSANDRA'}, {'name': 'AURAMBOUT JEAN PHILIPPE'}, {'name': 'TROMBETTI MARCO'}, {'name': 'JACOBS CHRISTIAAN'}, {'name': 'CRISTOBAL GARCIA JORGE'}, {'name': ""KANCS D'ARTIS""}, {'name': 'KAVALOV BOYAN'}]","regional patterns of energy production and consumption factors in europe

the justification to pursue geoengineering on the basis of  considering its pros and cons, is inadequate. moral judgement can still be elaborated in cases where decisions have to be made urgently and the selection of  desirable choices is severely limited. the changes needed to avoid severe negative impacts of  climate change requires commitment to mitigation as well as social changes because technical solutions cannot address the issue of  climate change altogether. the quantitative emphasis of  consumerism should shift to qualitative focus on the aspiration for simplicity in order to a move towards the objective of  the continuation of  the existence of  humankind and a flourishing, vital biosphere.globaali ilmastonmuutos ja ilmastonmuokkaus sisältävät useita eettisiä ongelmia, jotka kietoutuvat monimutkaiseksi kysymysten sarjaksi koskien koko biosfäärin tulevaisuutta. ilmastonmuutoksen aiheuttamia mahdollisia katastrofaalisia seurauksia kutsutaan myös ilmastohätätilaksi. ajatus ilmastonmuokkauksesta on syntynyt tämän mahdollisen hätätilan myötävaikutuksesta. soveltavan etiikan uusi alue, sääetiikka, on ilmastoetiikan osa-alue, joka on kiinnostunut ajallisesti ja paikallisesti rajatuista sään- ja ilmastonmuokkaukseen liittyvistä eettisistä ja poliittisista kysymyksistä. ilmastonmuokkauksen tavoitteena on tasapainottaa eri tavoin suuressa mittakaavassa ilmastonmuutoksen haitallisia vaikutuksia. tämän väitöskirjan keskeisin väite on, että on olemassa eettisiä perusteita, joiden mukaan tällä hetkellä laajamittaisesti toteutettu tai suunniteltu ilmastojärjestelmän muokkaaminen on eettisesti kyseenalaista.

the european electricity sector will have to deal with a huge challenge in the decades
to come. on the one hand, electrical power is increasingly substituted for other
forms of energy. it has been forecast that electricity demand will increase in the
future (notably because of new needs in transport and heat sectors), although it is
currently stagnant, mainly because of the economic crisis. unless a major alternative
energy source is discovered, electricity will become the central energy pillar in the
long term. on the other hand, electricity production remains uncertain and will
depend on numerous factors: the growth of renewable energy and decentralized
energy, the renewal of old power generation capacities, increased external dependency,
co2 charges, etc. this increases the demand for electricity networks that are
more reliable, more efficient, and more flexible. europe’s current electricity
networks are ageing, and, as already indicated by the international energy agency,
many of them will need to be modernized or replaced in the decades to come.
finally, the growing impact of energy trading also needs to be taken into account.
these considerations explain the need to modernize the electric grid through various
ict means. this modernization alone may allow the grid to become more flexible and
interactive, to provide real time feedback, more adaptation to a fluctuating demand,
and finally to reduce the global electricity costs.
the paper begins with a description of the eu definition of the term ‘smart grid’ (§ 1)
and of the body in charge of advising the commission (§ 2). the eu legal framework
applicable to smart grids is also detailed (§ 3). it is a rather complex domain,
connected to various regulations. the paper then examines three critical factors in
the development of smart grids (and smart meters as a precondition). standardization
is quite complex, but absolutely essential (§ 4). innovation is not easily put into
action (§ 5). finally, as digital insecurity has worsened dramatically in recent years,
the security of electricity networks, and especially their multiplied electronic components,
will become increasingly important (§ 6). lastly, the paper provides a concise
overview of the progress of smart grids in the eu in recent years (§ 7). in a nutshell,
the conclusion is that progress is quite slow, many obstacles remain, and, given the
appearance of many new regulatory problems, it would be useful to organize a
review of the present eu strategy",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2821'],"[{'name': 'Zgajewski, Tania'}]","smart electricity grids: a very slow deployment in the eu. egmont paper no. 74, february 2015",2015,,

   the quantification in this thesis is based on a mathematical optimisation model that aims to find the least costly combination of abatement strategies to reach a specific carbon emission target. the model covers the eu-27 member states and can be applied in static and stochastic form (paper i) or dynamic form (paper ii-iv). the main research questions investigated in the four separate studies are: i) the cost-efficiency and equity of including fcs in eu climate policy to 2020; ii) whether it is worth increasing fcs at the expense of bioenergy and forest products; iii) whether renewable energy forms (wind, hydro and photovoltaics) can compete with fcs as abatement methods; and iv) what the effects of climate change in terms of increased/reduced fcs will be during the current century and the accompanying implications on the cost of eu climate policy.



   the results, which can be useful for policy making, demonstrate cost efficiency in using fcs as an abatement method. however, this may be at the expense of reduced equity among eu member states, since forests are distributed unequally throughout the eu. furthermore, fcs seems to be a more cost-efficient option in terms of carbon abatement than bioenergy and, to some extent, forest products. this is also the case when comparing the cost-efficiency with that of renewables, even on modelling renewables with endogenous technological change in the form of learning-by-doing. the results provide indications of increasing fcs during the current century due to climate change, in particular in northern europe, where warmer seasons and more precipitation are expected. this would have a positive effect on the cost of reaching the emissions target, meaning that the overall abatement cost would be reduced",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/385'],"[{'name': 'Münnich Vass, Miriam'}]",cost-efficient carbon abatement strategies in the eu with specific focus on forest carbon sequestration,2015,,

neon isotope data are consistent with simple binary mixing between the injected and in situ natural gas. this relationship allows the ne isotope composition of the pre-injection gas in cranfield to be determined. coherent correlations between ne, he and ar isotopes allow the natural gas end-member composition to be calculated as well. the noble gas isotopic ratios (3he/4he = 0.05 ra, where ra is the atmospheric value of 1.39 x 10-6, 20ne/22ne = 9.62, 21ne/22ne = 0.0384, 40ar/36ar = 836 and 40ar*/4he = 0.09, where 40ar* is the sum of the radiogenic and mantle derived 40ar) of the natural gas in cranfield are typical of natural gases derived from the continental crust.

helium isotope ratios and the 40ar*/4he ratio notably correlate with co2 concentrations, indicating that the noble gas fingerprints of the injected gas are preserved, and may offer utility as a tracer of the co2. the he and ar isotope systematics of the four sampled wells that have the lowest co2 concentrations identify the loss of a significant amount of co2 from the free gas phase. the amount of loss in each of the four wells can be quantified from the measured 3he/4he and 40ar*/4he ratios and changes in the co2/3he values. losses vary between 22% and 96%, with good agreement between the different methods. it is notable however, that these four wells do not have significant gas production, and do not contribute significantly to the total amount of produced and re-injected gas. so, even though there is a significant loss from these wells, the total amount of co2 lost is estimated to be only ~0.1% of the total injected gas, equivalent to 10kt gas. notwithstanding this, the new data indicate that, across the entire field, co2 is retained as a free phase and stratigraphic trapping is the most important storage mechanism. the fractionation of 40ar*/4he, co2/3he and δ13cco2 in the co2-poor samples is consistent with dissolution in water.

the non-radiogenic noble gases (20ne, 36ar, 84kr, 132xe) originate from the atmosphere and are present in the gas, water and oil phases in the reservoir to differing degrees. it has been revealed that groundwater degassing, induced by co2 injection plays an important role in fractionating 20ne/36ar, 84kr/36ar and 132xe/36ar at the early stage of injection, but a large heterogeneity in the degree of degassing has been observed throughout the reservoir. some wells have shown 100% water degassing, while others are close to 0%. oil degassing, and therefore the active co2 – oil contact, became important during the later phase of injection, which is consistent with the fact that more co2 injection was required to degas the oil than water. temporal variations in the non-radiogenic noble gas ratios and 3he/4he are indicative of the evolution of the oil displacement efficiency. this fully agrees with the injection – production well data recorded in the field during sampling. this suggests that noble gases can also be used as a reservoir engineering tool to better understand the interaction of co2, water and oil in the subsurface not only during co2 storage but also to track eor operations",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/48'],"[{'name': 'Gyore, Domokos'}]",noble gases as tracers of injected co2 in the cranfield enhanced oil recovery field,2015,,

the framework known as carbon capture and storage (ccs) – or carbon capture utilization and storage (ccus) – comprises a portfolio of technologies applicable to large‐scale ghg sources for preventing co2 from entering the atmosphere. amongst them, co2 capture and mineralisation (ccm) presents the highest potential for co2 sequestration as the predicted carbon storage capacity (as mineral carbonates) far exceeds the estimated levels of the worldwide identified fossil fuel reserves.
the work presented in this thesis aims at taking a step forward to the deployment of an energy/cost effective process for simultaneous capture and storage of co2 in the form of thermodynamically stable and environmentally friendly solid carbonates. r&d work on the process considered here began in 2007 at åbo akademi university in finland. it involves the processing of magnesium silicate minerals with recyclable ammonium salts for extraction of magnesium at ambient pressure and 400‐440⁰c, followed by aqueous precipitation of magnesium in the form of hydroxide, mg(oh)2, and finally mg(oh)2 carbonation in a pressurised fluidized bed reactor at ~510⁰c and ~20 bar pco2 to produce high purity mgco3.
rock material taken from the hitura nickel mine, finland, and serpentinite collected from bragança, portugal, were tested for magnesium extraction with both ammonium sulphate and bisulphate (as and abs) for determination of optimal operation parameters, primarily: reaction time, reactor type and presence of moisture. typical efficiencies range from 50 to 80% of magnesium extraction at 350‐450⁰c. in general abs performs better than as showing comparable efficiencies at lower temperature and reaction times. the best experimental results so far obtained include 80% magnesium extraction with abs at 450⁰c in a laboratory scale rotary kiln and 70% mg(oh)2 carbonation in the pfb at 500⁰c, 20 bar co2 pressure for 15 minutes.
the extraction reaction with ammonium salts is not at all selective towards magnesium. other elements like iron, nickel, chromium, copper, etc., are also co‐extracted. their separation, recovery and valorisation are addressed as well and found to be of great importance.
the assessment of the exergetic performance of the process was carried out using aspen plus® software and pinch analysis technology. the choice of fluxing agent and its recovery method have a decisive sway in the performance of the process: as is recovered by crystallisation and in general the whole process requires more exergy (2.48–5.09 gj/tco2sequestered) than abs (2.48–4.47 gj/tco2sequestered) when abs is recovered by thermal decomposition. however, the corrosive nature of molten abs and operational problems inherent to thermal regeneration of abs prohibit this route. regeneration of abs through addition of h2so4 to as (followed by crystallisation) results in an overall negative exergy balance (mainly at the expense of low grade heat) but will flood the system with sulphates. although the åa route is still energy intensive, its performance is comparable to conventional co2 capture methods using alkanolamine solvents. an energy‐neutral process is dependent on the availability and quality of nearby waste heat and economic viability might be achieved with: magnesium extraction and carbonation levels ≥ 90%, the processing of co2‐containing flue gases (eliminating the expensive capture step) and production of marketable products",åbo akademi - åbo akademi university,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/987'],"[{'name': 'Romão, Inês'}]",production of magnesium carbonates from serpentinites for co2 mineral sequestration : optimisation towards industrial application,2015,,

growth diagnostics methodology and apply it to countries in africa.

the original growth diagnostics methodology was developed by haussmann, rodrik and
velasco to identify the key constraints holding back economic growth from its full
potential. their approach was driven by the needs of policymakers facing the dilemma
that most problems have multiple causes, but governments cannot tackle all of them at
once, given limitations in their financial and executive capacity. this gave rise to the idea
of concentrating these limited resources on the binding constraint, which would be
identified going through a tool conceptualised as a decision tree. the proponents of the
original growth diagnostics also realised that this binding constraint varies between
countries and - we would argue - between sectors.

the central point of the original growth diagnostics method was that it offered researchers
and policy makers a way of identifying priorities in analysis and policy; and finding
solutions which take into account local conditions. the same rationale applies to our
green growth diagnostic project. we build on the original approach but adapt it in four
ways: 1. applying it to the energy sector; 2. taking into account potential knock-on effects
on the economy; 3. the political economy when going from diagnostics to therapeutics;
and 4. working out the distributional consequences. since each step takes the project
into un(der)explored territory, it is built around five research questions and corresponding
methodologically distinct work packages.

our five research questions are: 1. what are the binding constraints for investment in
economically viable renewable energy?; 2.which policies can more effectively target
different binding constraints?; 3. who obstructs/drives the adoption of specific sustainable
energy policies?; 4. what would be the macroeconomic impacts of an increase in
renewable energy investment/capacity, and the reforms needed to bring this increase
about? and 5. under what circumstances increased on-grid renewable energy capacity
translates into increased access to and increased reliability of electricity supply in
developing countries? this paper pulls together what we can learn from the international
literature on these questions",institute of development studies - the impact initiative,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/603'],"[{'name': 'Pueyo, Ana'}, {'name': 'Spratt, Stephen'}, {'name': 'Schmitz, Hubert'}, {'name': 'Willenbockel, Dirk'}, {'name': 'Dent, Chris'}, {'name': 'Wade, Neal'}, {'name': 'Crossland, Andrew'}]",green growth diagnostics for africa: literature review and scoping study,2015,,

reflecting the growing momentum for carbon pricing worldwide, the 2015 edition of the state and trends of carbon pricing report targets a wider audience of public and private stakeholders who are engaged in carbon pricing design and implementation. this report also provides critical input for the negotiations leading up to the conference of the parties (cop) in paris.

as in the previous editions, the report provides an up-to-date overview of existing and emerging carbon pricing instruments around the world, including national and subnational initiatives. furthermore, it gives an overview of current corporate carbon pricing instruments.

to better reflect the plethora of topics being considered in the climate dialogue, the report also analyzes competitiveness and carbon leakage, and their impact on the development of carbon pricing instruments. the task team responsible for this report intends to select new relevant topics to be explored in future editions. these topics could include, for example, the effectiveness of existing and emerging carbon pricing instruments, and how to measure it.

finally, this year’s report gives the audience a forward-looking assessment of the advantages of international cooperation in reaching stringent global mitigation targets. a review of existing modeling work provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment of cost saving potentials and the magnitude of financial flows inherent to international cooperation aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to a level consistent with the 2°c climate stabilization goal",world bank,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/713'],"[{'name': 'Alexandre Kossoy'}, {'name': 'Grzegorz Peszko'}, {'name': 'Klaus Oppermann'}, {'name': 'Nicolai Prytz'}, {'name': 'Noemie Klein'}, {'name': 'Kornelis Blok'}, {'name': 'Long Lam'}, {'name': 'Lindee Wong'}, {'name': 'Bram Borkent'}]",state and trends of carbon pricing 2015,2015,,

first part of this study is devoted to thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures relevant for co2 storage with particular focus on effect of methane (ch4) and sulphur dioxide (so2) impurities. to do this, a molecular based framework, statistical association fluid theory (saft) is chosen and the molecular parameters required by the model were adjusted against the available experimental data. the developed model is effectively used to predict phase partitioning, the aqueous phase density and water drop-out in contact with solid surface, which we believe to be especially well-suited to the assessment of injectivity of a proposed co2 storage reservoir.
in the next part of this thesis, the processes of drying-out and salting-out were explored in more detail. this work encompasses the fabrication of the two sets of glass microchips, as well as series of experimental characterisation that has given us a valuable insight into the mechanism of salt precipitation. in particular, we have identified two mechanisms which together dramatically intensify the precipitation rate and amount of salt precipitated. from this insight, the reported discrepancies in the literature regarding the salt precipitation could be successfully explained and a new prototype for modeling of the process could be provided. we have also studied, but to a lesser extend, the effect of prepositional heterogeneities on the plume migration and pressure response at the injection well. we came to the conclusion that extreme well and aquifer pressures are unlikely for the setting studied in this thesis",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/715'],"[{'name': 'Miri, Rohaldin'}]",effects of co2-brine-rock interactions on co2 injectivity – implications for ccs,2015,,['1520-6106']

in this work, the prediction capabilities of these two eos were compared for several properties. the analysis began with an evaluation of their use in the prediction of the saturation properties of pure components and derivative properties from ambient conditions to the supercritical range. the particular derivative properties studied include the isochoric and isobaric heat capacities, the speed of sound, and the isothermal compressibility. in general, it was concluded that pc-saft outperforms pr in all cases. next, the same primary and derivative properties of several binary and a select ternary mixture were studied. to improve agreement with experimental data, a binary interaction parameter was introduced and fitted to binary mixture vapor – liquid equilibria (vle) data. this procedure drastically improved the accuracy of the models compared to the case where no binary interaction parameter used for the case of vle predictions. however, for the case of the derivative properties, the use of the binary interaction parameter to ensure a more accurate representation of the interactions between molecules had only a marginal effect on the prediction of these properties.

finally, phase equilibria of hydrates were studied. as eos for fluids are not designed to predict the properties of solid phases, the van der waals-platteeuw model was incorporated to allow for the prediction of three-phase equilibrium conditions of various hydrate formers. specifically, this work focused on the equilibrium of a water-rich liquid phase, a hydrate phase and a vapor phase rich in a hydrate former. in all cases, calculations of the solid hydrate phase properties are based on the kihara potential. this potential requires three parameters to be defined; initial values for which were found through a review of the literature. the accuracy of the predictions of the three-phase equilibrium is highly dependent on the reliability of these parameters. thus, one of the parameters, the so-called ε parameter, was fitted to hydrate equilibrium data and resulted in a significant improvement in the accuracy of predictions of both pc-saft and pr eos. the new set of parameters was then used to predict the three-phase equilibrium of several binary, ternary and quaternary mixtures of hydrate forming agents. several conclusions are drawn from this work, including the observation that the accuracy of the models is reduced when the number of components increases",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/3175'],"[{'name': 'El Meragawi, Sally'}]",modeling of thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria of multicomponent systems related to the oil and gas industry using the pc-saft equation of state,2015,,

the geological storage of co2 known as carbon capture and storage (ccs) is a key technology for the mitiga¬tion of climate sensitive greenhouse gas emissions recommended by the intergovernmental panel on climate change. marine saline aquifers are a favorable storage option, because such systems have virtually infinite capacity, no influence on ground water production and bear the least conflict potential with the public. howe¬ver, the success of ccs as a climate change mitigation technology depends on its public acceptance and builds on a reliable and transparent risk assessment, which is studied by the interdisciplinary, international eco2 project. the project’s main aims are to investigate the likelihood of leakage from marine co2 storage sites and its potential effect on marine ecosystems, to develop monitoring strategies, and to define best environmental practice guidelines for implementing and managing storage sites. 
within this framework, my phd thesis concentrates on the investigation of focused fluid conduits in the sou¬thern viking graben and their implications for the sleipner co2 storage project, where co2 is injected into a ~850 meter deep saline aquifer known as the utsira formation. my studies are based on the interpretation of 3d and time-lapse 4d seismic data covering more than 2000 km2 of the southern viking graben, numerical fluid flow simulation, and field geological observations. 
my thesis builds on a detailed description of the fluid flow system in the sleipner area, which is characterized by the interplay between deep hydrocarbon reservoirs, the utsira formation and the overlying strata hosting various fluid flow features. the key elements of seal-bypassing fluid flow in the strata overlying the utsira formation are several hundreds of meters-wide chimney structures. the study area hosts at least 46 of these focused fluid conduits, which are categorized based on their seismic appearance into three types (a, b and c). type-a-chimney shows similarities to “blowout pipes”, which are known from different sedimentary basins around the world and generally associated with rapid expulsion of fluids. type b is very similar to large “gas chimney” structures, which have been identified above several leaking hydrocarbon reservoirs and which are interpreted as gas filled fracture networks crosscutting a low permeable seal. type-c-chimneys cause seismic disturbances in bands of up to 6 km length and correlate with overlying tunnel valleys.
the formation of focused fluid conduits requires high pore overpressure. the analysis of the sleipner palaeo fluid flow system indicates that there may be a link between chimney formation and the last glacial cycle. building on this, we present a novel hypothesis, which predicts that undrained fluid flow systems could pro¬duce significant overpressure as a result of the interplay between loading and unloading during a glacial cycle and resulting gas compression and sediment compaction. 
the closest chimney structures with a probable connection to the utsira formation are 7 km away from the sleipner co2 injection point. we have evaluated the propensity of leakage along these structures by perfor¬ming numerical modeling of the co2 plume evolution with the multiphase fluid flow simulator dumux. the simulations revealed that it is not likely that the modeled co2 plume will ever reach the chimney structures. additionally, it is unlikely that the injection of co2 itself may cause the formation of chimney structures at sleipner.

although seismic pipes and chimneys are very common features in seismic data and their interpretation as focused fluid flow conduits is well-established, only little is known about the underlying geological processes and how these link up with their seismic image. the comparison of field analogues of focused fluid conduits from the colorado plateau (usa) and seismic chimneys revealed that specific seismic signatures correlate well with certain field-based examples. the integration of field geological observations may help to improve seismic interpretations of chimney structures and fluid flow systems in general.
the importance of focused fluid flow conduits for the evolution of sedimentary basins is not sufficiently addressed yet. the results of this thesis highlight the relevance of focused fluid flow conduits for long-term integrity of sub-seabed storage of co2 operations and that focused fluid flow conduits have to be considered for site selection of storage projects. a deeper understanding of focused fluid flow will help to understand the flux of fluids from the geosphere into the hydro- and atmosphere as well as geological and climatic processes of the past and future",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1784'],"[{'name': 'Karstens, Jens'}]",focused fluid conduits in the southern viking graben and their implications for the sleipner co2  storage project,2015,,

this study explores impacts of policies that south africa developed in order to champion sustainable energy strategies based on energy efficiency and non-conventional energy sources, including renewable energy. the mining sector, because of its energy-intensive nature, was chosen. in order to achieve this objective three approaches were carried out: (i) a critical review of literature on energy efficiency (ee) and renewable energy (re) ; (ii) two case-studies that demonstrate the impacts of the policies; and (iii) action research on a sample of mines using survey questionnaire and interviewing.
the research results show that the need to have security in energy and the need to be competitive and grow revenue are significant in deciding to carry out ee and re initiatives in the mining sector. the results also show that safety followed by production are the priorities and are accompanied by a range of other demands, such as cost reduction and legislative requirements. it is, therefore, within this context that ee and re initiative will always be carried out in the mining sector. the research concludes that, under the current market framework, south african ee and re policies are not as effective as hoped they would be. the research, therefore, recommends that a percentage of the mines’ revenue could be dedicated to ee and re initiatives. in addition, south africa needs to come up with a new type of productive endeavour that would lead to less extractive industries, including mines.afrikaanse opsomming: energie is, was en sal wereldwyd altyd die sleutel wees tot ekonomiese ontwikkeling. nieteenstaande, word dit wereldwyd aanvaar dat die huidige energie opwekking se koolstofdioksied vrystelling moontlik kan lei tot aardverwarming van 5 grade celsius of meer wanneer vergelyk met word met pre-industriële tye. daar is ‘n kritiese behoefte aan lae koolstofdioksied vrystelling ontwikkelings of ‘n beperking van konvensionele fossielbrandstof energiebronne.
hierdie studie analiseer die impak van die suid afrikaanse beleid wat ontwikkel is om volhoubare energie te bevorder wat effektief en onkonvensioneel is, insluitend hernubare energie. die mynsektor, as ‘n groot verbruiker van energie, vorm die kern van die studie. die studie is voltooi in drie fases naamlik: (1) kritiese oorsig van die literatuur oor energiedoeltreffendheid (ee) en hernubare energie (re); (2) twee gevallestudies wat die impak van die beleid bevestig; en (3) praktiese navorsing deur middel van vraelyste en persoonlike onderhoude met seker myne.
die navorsing bevestig dat die behoefte aan bestendige energie teen kompeterende pryse wat die mynsektor in staat stel om inkomste te groei ,‘n beduidende invloed het op die besluit om ee of re inisiatiewe te onderneem. die resultate bevestig verder dat beroepsveiligheid en produksie uitsette die eerste prioriteite vir die myne is. dit word verder beinvloed deur kostebesparings en wetlike vereistes. enige ee en re inisiatiewe wat onderneem word sal in hierdie konteks plaasvind. die navorsing kom tot die slotsom dat, onder huidige marktoestande, suid afrika se ee en re beleid nie so effektief is as waarop daar gehoop is nie. die navorsing beveel derhalwe aan dat ‘n persentasie van myne se inkomste geoormerk moet word vir ee en re inisiatiewe. verder meer , suid afrika moet strewe na tipes produksie wat minder natuurlike grondstowwe onttrek, insluitend die myne",stellenbosch : stellenbosch university,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/926'],"[{'name': 'Msimanga, Bongani'}]",exploring the impacts of renewable energy and energy efficiency policies on the mining sector,2015,,

the research consists of 31 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders of the electricity system from the government, regulatory, market and civil society based actor groups. in addition to this, the research utilised a secondary analysis of consultation responses and government publications. this thesis uses multi-layer perspective theory to interpret the transition from a centralised to decentralised electricity system. in addition to the multi-layer perspective, an advancement of the governance perspective was also required. this develops the understanding of the changes to the actor relationships rules and the incentives of a decentralised electricity system.
this research developed for key findings. firstly, a decentralised electricity future would introduce a larger number of small investors, who in a centralised system would not exist. the second key point is, the uk government is responsible for security of supply and their actions are focused on centralised electricity technologies. the third point is that energy security (in its boarder definition) is the responsibility of a network of actors working together. the fourth point is that current energy security is incorrectly dominated by supply meeting demand.

extensive research and development on renewable energy (re). one of the key

initiatives is the introduction of the building integrated photovoltaic (bipv).

however, the implementation of bipv is still relatively weak in the malaysia context.

this because of the developers’ are sceptical on investing in bipv and are concern to

integrating evs in large scale, would result in over-loading of eps. interconnection of dgs could impact adversely on the system operation including power quality and safety of the eps. however, due to the growing number of evs in the system, faster charging, shorter battery reaction time, and vehicle-to-grid services, evs could be attractive sources for system operators (sos) to improve system reliability while creating opportunity for ev owners to gain monetary beneﬁts. in addition, the potential beneﬁts of dg could be sustained in avoiding or shifting investment in transmission lines and/or transformers, minimizing ohmic losses, and protecting the environment.
in this dissertation, potential beneﬁts and challenges of evs and dgs are explored. for some potential beneﬁts, the dissertation develops systematic frameworks, in order to facilitate integration of evs and dgs into the eps. also for some challenges, the dissertation presents solutions to analyze and overcome related diﬃculties.
to study consequences of integrating evs, a comprehensive model of ev operation is presented. the model covers diﬀerent modes of operation and includes impact of battery degradation during the operation. the model is then extended to control a large group of evs eﬃciently. several possible ancillary services which could be oﬀered by evs, including voltage and frequency regulation services, are discussed. several systematic frameworks are developed to engage evs in provision of ancillary services, from economical and technical view points. simulation results clearly indicate evs ability to participate in ancillary services and possible revenue stream for ev owners.
in terms of dgs, the dissertation addresses a common issue in most of utility companies and that is the risk of unintentional islanding of interconnected dgs. a systematic procedure is presented in this dissertation which can detect any possible operating conditions leading to an unintentional islanding of dgs. the developed procedure can serve utility companies as an analytical tool for any interconnection study, in a timely and costly eﬃcient manner. the procedure is not dependent on the anti-islanding schemes nor dg technologies. simulation results of diﬀerent real case studies prove the generality and practicality of the procedure",surface at syracuse university,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2649'],"[{'name': 'Nikkhah Mojdehi, Mohammad'}]",integration of evs and dgs into the electric power system  for grid modernization,2015,,

number of components with the aim of producing electricity at high cycle
efficiencies and near zero emissions. this research focussed on igcc with
coal as a feedstock in an attempt to establish the applicability of this technology
in south africa.
fluidised bed gasification technology was found to be the fine coal gasification
technology in igcc with greatest potential when considering the qualities of
coals currently being used in local power stations. gasification test work on four
selected south african coals was undertaken at the csir gasification testing
facility, to assess the behaviour and compatibility of these coals with fluidised
bed gasification.
a further aspect investigated the likely emissions that would be produced and
how these compare to the national limits set by the department of
environmental affairs. during the course of the literature survey, it became
apparent that the reduction of gaseous emissions from igcc plant will have a
significant impact on the economic and environmental aspects and therefore
the attractiveness of the igcc technology.
for this reason the research direction turned to investigate in greater detail the
emissions generated from the combustion of syngas produced from fluidised
bed gasification and combusted in a gas turbine. this serves to be an
estimation of emissions that may be expected from the syngas combustion
turbine in an igcc technology.
the estimated emissions were used to assess the impact that the selected
coals may be expected to have on full scale emissions. it was also established
that the agent used in gasifying these coals had an influence on the quality of

to obtain the optimal cao-based sorbent, different sacrificial particles were used in the sorbent modification experiment, including hydrophobic polymers and non-ionic surfactants. among the combinations, modified cao sorbents prepared with polyethylene glycol (peg) and tween80 (also called polysorbate 80) delivered the best performance. using sacrificial particles resulted in changing the properties of cao particles, both physically and chemically: particle size, morphology, surface area and porosity were carefully controlled under specific synthesis conditions, and positively affected the sorbents’ reactivity. a more important factor, which has been ignored by most researchers, the polymorph of sorbent precursor, was also investigated in this thesis. repeatable results proved that of the sorbents derived from all the three polymorphs of calcium carbonate (calcite, aragonite and vaterite) vaterite-derived sorbent has the best co2 capture capacity and reversibility. we found that the fraction of vaterite would influence the sorbent particles’ reactivity proportionally in the first-cycle carbonation process.
in order to study the sorbent’s physical/chemical properties and its co2 uptake performance, standard laboratory characterisation methods and a thermal-gravimetric analyser were employed, respectively.
a combined gas sorption experiment under controlled conditions using a self-built high pressure reactor also revealed the mechanism of co2 sorption on different types of porous materials. the existing equipment used to achieve this purpose usually requires a very large scale and involves a rather complicated micro-mechanical structure. a novel measurement methodology based on micro-cantilever design and laser detector was introduced in order to reduce this complexity. physisorption of co2 gas molecules by porous materials, such as zeolite and mcm41, was measured kinetically with the help of this setup. a comparison between chemisorption and physisorption provides useful insights in regard to the search for the best solution for co2 capture.open acces","chemical engineering, imperial college london",['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/105'],"[{'name': 'Wang, Yan'}]",novel synthetic calcium oxide based sorbent for carbon dioxide capture,2015,,

scepticism concerning its validity is currently dwarfed by the intensification of
extreme weather events whilst the gradual arising level of anthropogenic co2
is pointed out as its main driver. most of the greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions
come from large point sources (heat and power production and industrial
processes) and the continued use of fossil fuels requires quick and effective
measures to meet the world’s energy demand whilst (at least) stabilizing co2
atmospheric levels.
the framework known as carbon capture and storage (ccs) – or carbon
capture utilization and storage (ccus) – comprises a portfolio of technologies
applicable to large‐scale ghg sources for preventing co2 from entering the
atmosphere. amongst them, co2 capture and mineralisation (ccm) presents
the highest potential for co2 sequestration as the predicted carbon storage
capacity (as mineral carbonates) far exceeds the estimated levels of the
worldwide identified fossil fuel reserves.
the work presented in this thesis aims at taking a step forward to the
deployment of an energy/cost effective process for simultaneous capture and
storage of co2 in the form of thermodynamically stable and environmentally
friendly solid carbonates. r&d work on the process considered here began in
2007 at åbo akademi university in finland. it involves the processing of
magnesium silicate minerals with recyclable ammonium salts for extraction of
magnesium at ambient pressure and 400‐440⁰c, followed by aqueous
precipitation of magnesium in the form of hydroxide, mg(oh)2, and finally
mg(oh)2 carbonation in a pressurised fluidized bed reactor at ~510⁰c and ~20
bar pco2 to produce high purity mgco3.
rock material taken from the hitura nickel mine, finland, and serpentinite
collected from bragança, portugal, were tested for magnesium extraction with
both ammonium sulphate and bisulphate (as and abs) for determination of optimal operation parameters, primarily: reaction time, reactor type and
presence of moisture. typical efficiencies range from 50 to 80% of magnesium
extraction at 350‐450⁰c. in general abs performs better than as showing
comparable efficiencies at lower temperature and reaction times. the best
experimental results so far obtained include 80% magnesium extraction with
abs at 450⁰c in a laboratory scale rotary kiln and 70% mg(oh)2 carbonation in
the pfb at 500⁰c, 20 bar co2 pressure for 15 minutes.
the extraction reaction with ammonium salts is not at all selective towards
magnesium. other elements like iron, nickel, chromium, copper, etc., are also
co‐extracted. their separation, recovery and valorisation are addressed as well
and found to be of great importance.
the assessment of the exergetic performance of the process was carried out
using aspen plus® software and pinch analysis technology. the choice of
fluxing agent and its recovery method have a decisive sway in the performance
of the process: as is recovered by crystallisation and in general the whole
process requires more exergy (2.48–5.09 gj/tco2sequestered) than abs (2.48–
4.47 gj/tco2sequestered) when abs is recovered by thermal decomposition.
however, the corrosive nature of molten abs and operational problems
inherent to thermal regeneration of abs prohibit this route. regeneration of
abs through addition of h2so4 to as (followed by crystallisation) results in an
overall negative exergy balance (mainly at the expense of low grade heat) but
will flood the system with sulphates. although the åa route is still energy
intensive, its performance is comparable to conventional co2 capture methods
using alkanolamine solvents. an energy‐neutral process is dependent on the
availability and quality of nearby waste heat and economic viability might be
achieved with: magnesium extraction and carbonation levels ≥ 90%, the
processing of co2‐containing flue gases (eliminating the expensive capture
step) and production of marketable products.global uppvärmning är ett av århundradets mest alarmerande problem. den
ursprungliga tvekan på dess verklighet överskuggas nu av ökningen av
extrema väderhändelser med den stigande halten av antropogent co2 utpekad
som den främsta orsaken. största delen av utsläppen av växthusgas (ghg) är
från stora punktkällor, så som värme‐ och elproduktion samt
industriprocesser. snabba och effektiva åtgärder krävs för att stabilisera co2
halten i atmosfärens i samband med fortsatt användning av fossila bränslen för
att möta världens energibehov.
ramverket som kallas carbon capture and storage (ccs) ‐ eller carbon
capture utlization and storage (ccus) ‐ består av en portfölj teknologier som
kan utnyttjas i samband med storskaliga växthusgaskällor för att förhindra co2
utsläpp i atmosfären. bland dem har co2‐avskiljning och mineralisering (ccm)
den största potentialen för co2 sekvestrering eftersom den förutsagda
lagringskapaciteten av koldioxid (som mineralkarbonater) väl överstiger de
beräknade mängderna av världens identifierade fossila bränslereserver.

stenmaterial från hitura nickelgruva, i finland, och serpentinit uppsamlat från
bragança, portugal, testades för magnesium extraktion med både
ammoniumsulfat och ammoniumbisulfat (as och abs). detta gjordes för att bestämma de optimala driftsparametrarna, främst: reaktionshastighet,
reaktortyp och inverkan av fukt. verkningsgraden för extraktion av
magnesium vid 350‐450⁰c varierar generellt mellan 50 och 80 %. i allmänhet
presterar abs bättre än as och har en jämförbar verkningsgrad vid lägre
temperaturer och kortare reaktionstider. de hittills bästa erhållna
experimentella resultaten visar 80% magnesium extraktion med abs vid
450⁰c i en laboratorieskalig roterande ugn och 70% mg(oh)2 karbonatisering i
en pfb vid 510⁰c, 20 bar co2 tryck i 15 minuter.
extraktionsreaktionen med ammoniumsalter är inte helt selektiva för
magnesium. andra element såsom järn, nickel, krom, koppar och så vidare är
också extraherade. deras återvinning och tillvaratagande behandlas också
eftersom de är av stor betydelse.
bedömningen av processens exergi prestanda genomfördes med hjälp av
aspen plus® programvara och pinch analys. valet av flussmedel och
återvinningsmetod har en stor inverkan på. as återvinns genom kristallisation
och kräver i allmänhet mer exergi (2,48‐5,09 gj / t co2 sekvestrerat) än abs
(2,48‐4,47 gj / t co2 sekvestrerat) som återvins genom termisk nedbrytning.
de korrosiva egenskaperna av smält abs och de operativa problemen med
termisk regenerering av abs hindrar användningen av denna metod.
regenerering av abs genom tillsats av h2so4 till as, följt av kristallisation,
resulterar i en totalt sett negativ exergi balans men huvudsakligen på
bekostnad av låggradig värme. detta kommer dock att översvämma systemet
med sulfater. fastän åa vägen fortfarande är energiintensiv, är dess prestanda
jämförbar med konventionella co2 infångningsmetoder som använder
alkanolaminlösningar. en energineutral process är möjlig ifall det finns tillgång
till närliggande spillvärme av tillräklig kvalitet. processen är lönsam ifall en
nivå på över 90 % kan uppnås för både magnesium utvinningen och
karbonatisering och co2‐innehållande rökgaser kan behandla direkt, vilket
eliminerar dyra infångningssteget, och produkten kan säljas.o aquecimento global é um dos problemas mais alarmantes deste século e o
aumento gradual dos níveis atmosféricos de co2 é apontado como a sua
principal causa. o cepticismo inicial acerca da sua validade é actualmente
contrariado pela intensificação de eventos climáticos extremos. a emissão de
gases de efeito estufa (gee) é predominante em processos industriais e de
produção de energia. no sentido de (pelo menos) estabilizar os níveis
atmosféricos de co2, é necessário desenvolver um conjunto de medidas
rápidas e eficazes que permitam o uso continuado de combustíveis fósseis e
satisfazer a demanda mundial de energia.
a captura e armazenamento de carbono (ccs) ‐ ou captura utilização e
armazenamento de carbono (ccus) ‐ dispõe de um portfólio de tecnologias
aplicáveis às fontes de gee em grande escala para prevenir a entrada de co2 na
atmosfera. entre eles, a captura de co2 através carbonatação mineral (ccm)
apresenta o maior potencial de sequestro de co2 com uma capacidade prevista
de armazenamento de carbono que (em muito) excede os níveis estimados das
reservas mundiais de combustíveis fósseis.
o trabalho apresentado nesta tese tem como objetivo dar um passo em frente
no desenvolvimento de um processo energética e economicamente viável para
a captura e armazenamento simultâneos de co2, sob a forma de carbonatos
sólidos, termodinamicamente estáveis e ambientalmente benignos. os
trabalhos de i&d sobre o processo considerado iniciaram‐se em 2007 na åbo
akademi university, finlândia. este envolve o processamento de silicatos de
magnésio (serpentinitos) com sais de amónio (recicláveis) para extracção de
magnésio (e outros metais como por exemplo o ferro) sob a forma de sulfatos
(xso4) a 400‐440⁰c e pressão atmosférica. após dissolução dos produtos
sólidos, magnésio e ferro são recuperados por precipitação selectiva na forma
de hidróxidos. finalmente, o mg(oh)2 produzido é convertido em mgco3 de elevada pureza num reactor de leito fluidizado pressurizado (pfb) a ~ 500⁰c e
~ 20 bar pco2.
serpentinitos provenientes de bragança, portugal e de uma mina de níquel
localizada em hitura, finlândia, foram testados para a extração de magnésio
com sulfato e bissulfato de amónio (as e abs) para determinação das
condições óptimas dos parâmetros ideais de operação, sobretudo tempo de
reacção, design do reactor e presença de humidade. eficiências típicas variam
entre 50‐80% de extracção de magnésio a 350‐450⁰c. no geral, o abs é mais
eficaz do que o as mostrando eficiências comparáveis com temperaturas e
tempos de reacção mais baixas. os melhores resultados experimentais obtidos
incluem 80% de extracção de magnésio com abs a 450⁰c num forno rotativo
de escala laboratorial e 70% de carbonatação de mg(oh)2 no pfb a 510⁰c,
pressão parcial de co2 de 20 bar, em 15 minutos.
a reacção de extracção com sais de amónio não é, de forma alguma, selectiva
em relação ao magnésio. outros elementos, tais como ferro, níquel, crómio,
cobre, etc, são também co‐extraídos. a sua separação e recuperação são
também discutidas nesta tese concluindo‐se que a valorização destes produtos
secundários é de grande importância para o sucesso económico do processo.
a avaliação do desempenho exergético do processo foi realizada utilizando o
software de simulação aspen plus® e técnicas de análise pinch. a escolha do
agente de extracção e seu método de recuperação tem uma influência decisiva
no consumo energético: quando o as é recuperado por cristalização, no seu
total o processo requer 2,48‐5,09 gj/tco2 sequestrado, enquanto que a
decomposição térmica de as em abs resulta num processo que precisa de
2,48‐4,47 gj/tco2 sequestrado. no entanto, a natureza corrosiva do abs
fundido e problemas operacionais inerentes à regeneração térmica de abs,
proíbem esta via. a regeneração de abs por adição de h2so4 (seguida por
cristalização) resulta num balanço exergético negativo (essencialmente à custa
de calor residual de baixa temperatura) mas satura o sistema com sulfatos. todavia, e apesar de o processo em estudo ainda ser energeticamente
intensivo, o seu desempenho é comparável aos métodos convencionais de
captura de co2, que utilizem solventes como alcanolaminas, por exemplo. a
desejada neutralidade energética do processo depende da disponibilidade e
qualidade de calor residual (proveniente de industrias contíguas) e a
viabilidade económica pode ser alcançada com níveis de extração e
carbonatação de magnésio ≥ 90%, com o tratamento directo de gases de
combustão contendo co2 (eliminando a dispendiosa etapa de captura) e com a
produção de produtos comercializáveis",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/614'],"[{'name': 'Romão, Inês Sofia Soares'}]",production of magnesium carbonates from serpentinites for co2 mineral sequestration : optimisation towards industrial application,2015,,

to obtain the optimal cao-based sorbent, different sacrificial particles were used in the sorbent modification experiment, including hydrophobic polymers and non-ionic surfactants. among the combinations, modified cao sorbents prepared with polyethylene glycol (peg) and tween80 (also called polysorbate 80) delivered the best performance. using sacrificial particles resulted in changing the properties of cao particles, both physically and chemically: particle size, morphology, surface area and porosity were carefully controlled under specific synthesis conditions, and positively affected the sorbents’ reactivity. a more important factor, which has been ignored by most researchers, the polymorph of sorbent precursor, was also investigated in this thesis. repeatable results proved that of the sorbents derived from all the three polymorphs of calcium carbonate (calcite, aragonite and vaterite) vaterite-derived sorbent has the best co2 capture capacity and reversibility. we found that the fraction of vaterite would influence the sorbent particles’ reactivity proportionally in the first-cycle carbonation process.
in order to study the sorbent’s physical/chemical properties and its co2 uptake performance, standard laboratory characterisation methods and a thermal-gravimetric analyser were employed, respectively.
a combined gas sorption experiment under controlled conditions using a self-built high pressure reactor also revealed the mechanism of co2 sorption on different types of porous materials. the existing equipment used to achieve this purpose usually requires a very large scale and involves a rather complicated micro-mechanical structure. a novel measurement methodology based on micro-cantilever design and laser detector was introduced in order to reduce this complexity. physisorption of co2 gas molecules by porous materials, such as zeolite and mcm41, was measured kinetically with the help of this setup. a comparison between chemisorption and physisorption provides useful insights in regard to the search for the best solution for co2 capture.open acces","chemical engineering, imperial college london",['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/105'],"[{'name': 'Wang, Yan'}]",novel synthetic calcium oxide based sorbent for carbon dioxide capture,2015,,

once the injection is initiated there is a corresponding injection-induced pressurization of the reservoir which is typically monitored by an array of pressure sensors located within the storage reservoir as well as the surrounding formations. the monitoring of pressure build-up can provide explicit information on the reservoir security and integrity. chapter 3 within this work evaluated pressurization of a co2 reservoir system in the presence of leakage pathways as well as exploring the effects of compartmentalization of the reservoir utilizing surrogate modeling techniques (e.g. design of experiments (doe) and response surface methodology (rsm)). two simulation models were developed (1) an idealized scenario for the evaluation of multiple doe methods, and (2) a complex scenario implementing the best performing doe method to investigate pressurization of the reservoir system. the evaluation of scenario 1, determined that the central composite design would be implemented in the complex scenario. the complex scenario evaluated 5 uncertain factors: the permeabilities of the reservoir, seal, leakage pathway and fault, and the location of the pathway. a total of 36 response surface equations (rses) were developed for the complex scenario with an average r2 of 0.94 and a nrmse of 0.060. sensitivity to the input factors were dynamic through space and time. at the earliest time the impact of the reservoir permeability was dominant, whereas the fault permeability became dominant for later times (\u3e0.5 years). the rses were implemented in a monte carlo analysis to analyze leakage and pressurization risks. at the earliest time the permeability of the leakage pathway had a sufficiently high influence on the above-zone pressure allowing for adequate determination of leakage risk. at later times (\u3e0.5 years) that fault permeability became dominate inhibiting the determination of leakage risk while allowing for sufficient determination of pressurization risk",uwm digital commons,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/3551'],"[{'name': 'Guyant, Ethan'}]",addressing potential risks and challenges of co2 geologic sequestration,2015,,

reduce anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. scientific
assessments suggest that deep porous rock formations saturated with brine
(saline aquifers) provide the largest storage potential due to their abundance
in the earth’s sedimentary basins. however, geological underground storage of
co2 (carbon dioxide) may also cause serious negative environmental and
infrastructural impacts. the far-reaching pressure build-up affects regional
fluid flow and may compromise mechanical rock integrity by changes in the
recent stress field. structural failure of reservoir, caprock or adjacent
fault zones, accompanied by co2 leakage or large-scale displacement of brines
are among potential risks associated with co2 injection into deeper saline
formations. if brine reaches shallower aquifer complexes by upward migration
through conductive pathways such as improperly sealed abandoned wells,
permeable faults or erosive discontinuities in the overlying rocks, freshwater
resources can be endangered by salinization. the present thesis aims at
evaluating the hydraulic and mechanical impacts of industrial-scale co2
injection and the resulting pressure increase for a potential saline onshore
storage formation in the middle buntsandstein sequence of the northeast german
basin. here, the main emphasis is to assess the degree and bandwidth of
potential shallow aquifer salinization by upward brine migration through
permeable regional fault zones at the beeskow-birkholz storage site. thereby,
it is important to determine, which geological conditions promote upward brine
displacement in geological co2 storage, and whether the pressure build-up
affects the mechanical integrity of fault zones and/or caprocks. four
geological 3d models with an extent between 1,765 km2 and 10,000 km2 and
different layer structures serve as the basis for this research and are
implemented in multi-phase flow and coupled hydro-mechanical simulations. the
methodology applied for model set up and data integration varied, depended on
the respective focus of investigation. for flow simulations, regional fault
zones are described in the models either by real grid elements or by virtual
elements that allow for a discrete fault representation without introducing
specific grid refinements in the near-fault area. in the mechanical
simulations, a plasto-elastic constitutive model for fault zones is applied,
using embedded weak planes of corresponding dip angle and dip direction at the
respective fault element locations. multi-phase flow simulation results show
that the magnitude of pressure build-up in the storage formation and pressure
development over time determine the intensity and duration of brine flow into
overlying aquifers. salinity in the shallower aquifer increases only locally
close to the fault zones, whereby the degree in salinization mainly depends on
the lateral boundary conditions, the effective damage zone volume of fault
zones, the presence of overlying reservoirs and the initial salinity
distribution defined for the simulation scenario. the permeability of fault
zones, however, has a comparatively minor impact on shallow aquifer
salinization. short hydraulically conductive fault segments lead to the
highest local salinity increase, whereas laterally open boundaries and
overlying reservoirs connected to the fault zones significantly diminish the
risk of shallow aquifer salinization. knowledge on the initial salinity
distribution in the fault is essential for salinization assessments, since the
displaced brine originates from the upper part of the faults only, and not
from greater depths. structural failure of fault zones as a consequence of
injection-induced pressure build-up and effective stress changes can increase
the risk of upward brine migration. to assess the fault slip and dilation
tendencies at the respective site, one-way coupled hydro-mechanical
simulations were applied in subsequent analysis. a one-way coupling procedure
considers the time-dependent pore pressure development obtained from the
dynamic flow simulations as input to hydro-mechanical simulations. the hydro-
mechanical simulator then calculates potential rock mass failure resulting
from stress changes without providing feedback to the flow simulator. in a
first approach, the pressure distribution obtained from the flow simulations,
was fitted by polynomial functions and integrated into the hydro-mechanical
simulator for selected time steps. simulation results demonstrate that only
very few fault elements in the model are affected by shear and tensile rock
failure, so that the development of a consistent slip plane along the faults,
and thus fault reactivation is consequently expected not to occur at the
beeskow-birkholz site under the given assumptions. for coupling evaluation,
the applied one-way procedure was carried out for an equivalent saline onshore
storage site in the norwegian-danish basin close to the city of vedsted,
including a numerical modelling benchmark against the results produced by
another well-established modelling group. the application of identical models
for this process coupling allows an element-wise implementation of the time-
dependant pore pressure distribution from the dynamic flow into the hydro-
mechanical simulator. simulation results show that mechanical impacts are
mainly determined by fault conductivity and caprock permeability, which are
influencing the spatial pore pressure distribution. a higher permeability of
the caprock above the storage formation consequently induces higher vertical
uplifts at the ground surface. in the present thesis, it is shown that the
presence of hydraulically conductive faults must not necessarily lead to
shallow aquifer salinization, since various factors have been proven to
influence the occurrence and degree of salinization under the tested
constraints at the respective storage site. the magnitude of pressure increase
in the reservoir is the driving factor in upward brine migration through fault
zones: larger pressures induce stronger brine displacement, and consequently
result in higher salinities in shallow aquifers. the magnitude of pressure
build-up in turn, depends on the chosen lateral boundary conditions, the
presence of overlying reservoirs and the effective damage zone volume of
faults. at beeskow-birkholz, shallow aquifer salinization did not occur over
large areas and the faults were not affected by structural failure. however,
if brine reaches groundwater bodies, the local maximum salinity increase above
the salt-freshwater boundary can reach a concentration larger than the limit
prescribed by the german drinking water directive. in summary, numerical
models can be well applied to obtain site-specific insights into the fluid
flow dynamics in geological co2 storage. at the same time, the simulations
help to identify the geological conditions with the greatest impact on upward
brine migration and provide an initial assessment of the anticipated risks
including their extent and significance.die abscheidung und speicherung von kohlenstoff (engl. carbon capture and
storage, ccs) wird als eine vielversprechende maßnahme angesehen, die
anthropogen verursachten treibhausgasemissionen in die atmosphäre zu
reduzieren. wissenschaftliche schätzungen gehen davon aus, dass poröse und mit
salzwasser gesättigte gesteinsformationen (saline aquifere), aufgrund ihrer
weiten verbreitung in den sedimentbecken der erde, das größte
speicherpotential bieten. die nutzung des untergrunds für die speicherung von
co2 (kohlenstoffdioxid) kann jedoch schwerwiegende umweltschädliche und
infrastrukturelle auswirkungen haben. durch die im allgemeinen sehr
weitreichende druckerhöhung wird die regionale grundwasserströmung beeinflusst
und die mechanische gesteinsintegrität durch änderungen im rezenten
spannungsfeld gefährdet. strukturelles versagen von reservoir, abdeckender
barriereschicht, oder nah gelegenen störungszonen sowie co2-leckage oder
großräumige verdrängung von hoch salinaren wässern (sole) werden als
potentielle risiken der co2-speicherung in tiefen salinen aquiferen angesehen.
erreicht die sole über hydraulisch durchlässige migrationspfade, wie
möglicherweise unzureichend verschlossene altbohrungen, permeable störungen
oder erosive diskontinuitäten im deckgebirge, flachere
grundwasserleiterkomplexe, können süßwasserreserven durch versalzung erheblich
beeinträchtigt werden. in der vorliegenden dissertation soll daher für eine
potentielle saline speicherformation im mittleren buntsandstein des
nordostdeutschen beckens untersucht werden, welche hydraulischen und
mechanischen auswirkungen eine industriemaßstäbliche co2-speicherung und die
damit einhergehende porendruckerhöhung zur folge haben kann. der schwerpunkt
liegt hierbei darauf, den grad und die bandbreite einer möglichen versalzung
von überliegenden aquiferen durch solemigration über permeable regionale
störungszonen für den standort beeskow-birkholz abzuschätzen. des weiteren
soll untersucht werden, welche geologischen gegebenheiten eine
aufwärtsgerichtete solemigration über störungen begünstigen und wie sich die
druckerhöhung im speicherhorizont auf die geomechanische integrität von
störungszonen und/oder abdecker auswirkt. vier geologische 3d modelle, mit
einer ausdehnung zwischen 1.765 km2 und 10.000 km2 und einem unterschiedlichen
schichtaufbau, bilden die basis für mehrphasenfluss- und gekoppelte
hydromechanische simulationen. modellaufbau und datenintegration erfolgten in
abhängigkeit des jeweiligen untersuchungsschwerpunktes unter anwendung
verschiedener methoden. in den flusssimulationen werden die regionalen
störungszonen in den modellen entweder über reale gitterelemente oder über
virtuelle elemente repräsentiert, die eine diskrete darstellung der störungen
erlauben, ohne das gitter im störungsnahbereich zu verfeinern. für die
mechanischen simulationen werden die störungszonen in die elastisch-
plastischen modelle als versagensflächen integriert, die entsprechend der
störungen orientiert sind. die ergebnisse aus den mehrphasenflusssimulationen
zeigen, dass die intensität und dauer von solefluss in überliegende aquifere
bestimmt wird, durch die stärke des druckaufbaus in der speicherformation und
der druckentwicklung über die zeit. die salinität im flachen aquifer steigt
nur lokal im nahbereich der störungen, wobei der grad der versalzung im
wesentlichen von den definierten seitlichen modellrandbedingungen, dem
durchflusswirksamen störungsvolumen, dem vorhandensein von überliegenden
reservoiren sowie der initialen salinitätsverteilung abhängt. die
permeabilität der störungen hingegen, hat einen vergleichsweise geringen
einfluss auf die salinität flacherer aquifere. kurze hydraulisch durchlässige
störungssegmente bewirken den stärksten lokalen salinitätsanstieg, wohingegen
seitlich offene modellränder und überliegende reservoire, die ebenfalls mit
den störungszonen verbunden sind, das risiko einer versalzung im flachen
aquifer erheblich mindern. die initiale salinitätsverteilung in der störung
ist bei der beurteilung von versalzungen ebenfalls von großer bedeutung, da
die verdrängte sole lediglich aus dem oberen teil der störung und nicht aus
großen tiefen stammt. strukturelles versagen von störungszonen, als folge des
injektionsbedingten druckanstiegs, würde das risiko einer solemigration in
überliegende schichten erhöhen. um die tendenz einer störungsreaktivierung am
speicherstandort zu evaluieren, wurde eine ein-weg-kopplung genutzt. in einer
ein-weg-kopplung wird die zeitabhängige porendruckverteilung aus den
mehrphasenflusssimulationen an den hydromechanischen simulator übergeben. der
hydro-mechanische simulator berechnet als folge der spannungsänderung
daraufhin mögliches strukturelles versagen des gesteins, ohne dass der
mehrphasenflusssimulator rückinformation erhält. in einem ersten ansatz, wird
die druckverteilung aus den vorangegangenen mehrphasenflusssimulationen über
polynomfunktionen angepasst und für ausgewählte zeitschritte in den
hydromechanischen simulator integriert. die simulationsergebnisse zeigen, dass
es im modellgebiet nur sehr vereinzelt zu scher- und zugversagen kommt. die
ausbildung einer konsistenten gleitfläche entlang der störungen und folglich
eine störungsreaktivierung, ist unter den getroffenen annahmen am standort
beeskow-birkholz daher eher unwahrscheinlich. zur kopplungsevaluierung wurde
die vorgestellte ein-weg-kopplung im letzten teil der arbeit auch an einem
salinen aquifer einer zweiten potentiellen co2-speicherformation, im
norwegisch-dänischen becken, nahe vedsted, angewandt. dies schloss eine
numerische benchmark-studie mit ein, in der die simulationsergebnisse mit
denen einer weiteren modellierungsgruppe verglichen wurden. die auf
identischen modellen beruhende prozesskopplung, ermöglicht eine elementweise
übertragung des berechneten porendrucks aus dem mehrphasenflusssimulator an
den hydromechanischen simulator, für ausgewählte zeitschritte. die
simulationsergebnisse zeigen, dass eine mechanische beeinträchtigung des
gesteins von der hydraulischen durchlässigkeit der störungszonen sowie der
durchlässigkeit der deckschichten über der speicherformation abhängt, da diese
die porendruckverteilung im reservoir wesentlich beeinflussen. eine höhere
durchlässigkeit der deckschicht hat zur folge, dass sich vertikale hebungen an
der erdoberfläche verstärken. in der vorliegenden arbeit wird gezeigt, dass
hydraulisch durchlässige störungen nicht zwingend zu einer versalzung
oberflächennaher aquifere führen müssen. verschiedene faktoren beeinflussen
nachweislich das auftreten und den grad einer versalzung am
untersuchungsstandort. der druck in der speicherformation ist die treibende
kraft der aufwärtsgerichteten solemigration durch störungen: in abhängigkeit
der druckzunahme erhöht sich die menge der verdrängten sole in flache aquifere
wodurch der versalzungsgrad steigt. die stärke des druckaufbaus ist wiederum
abhängig von den seitlichen modellrandbedingungen, dem vorhandensein von
überliegenden reservoiren und dem durchflusswirksamen störungsvolumen. am
standort beeskow-birkholz wurde ein salinitätsanstieg im flachen aquifer nur
im nahbereich der störungen beobachtet, strukturelles versagen an den
störungen trat nicht auf. simulationsergebnisse zeigen jedoch, dass die
salzkonzentrationen im grundwasser den grenzwert der deutschen
trinkwasserverordnung im bereich der störungen lokal übersteigen können.
zusammenfassend kann festgehalten werden, dass durch die anwendung von
numerischen modellen standortspezifische vorhersagen zu den auswirkungen der
geologischen co2-speicherung getroffen werden können. des weiteren helfen sie
dabei, die geologischen bedingungen zu identifizieren, die eine
aufwärtsgerichtete solemigration durch störungen begünstigen. ferner können

after more than twenty years of applying eia, the czech law is still not in compliance with the eu law. for more than ten years czech politicians have successfully resisted the need for compliance with the eu requirements on public participation and access to justice. this active resistance is subject of relentless criticism from the environmental non-governmental organizations (“ngos”) and lately also from the eu commission. the czech attitude towards its eu membership duties can be characterized by one czech proverb that gained popularity during the soviet rule: to trick the regime, act cunningly so as the hungry wolf fills up but the goat he wanted to eat remains unharmed. in this respect the czechs often act as though they have fulfilled all their duties properly (so the hungry wolf filled up), but nothing has in fact changed (the goat remained whole).
this article traces development of environmental impact assessment law in the czech republic during its preparation for the accession to the eu and then during eu membership and uses an example of environmental impact assessment law to show how the post-communist legacy lead the czech republic from an ambition to be a leader in environmental policymaking to a position of a laggard. it concludes that for the post-communist countries, such as the czech republic, the eu membership plays an important role of a stabilizing factor and the only driving force for enhancing environmental standard",washington & lee university school of law scholarly commons,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/3602'],"[{'name': 'Tomoszkova, Veronika'}]",implementation of the eu directive on environmental impact assessment in the czech republic: how long can the wolf be tricked?,2015,,

the aim of this thesis was to assess the climate impact of bioenergy systems and develop the methodology used to evaluate these systems. the biomass from a src willow plantation can be used in a number of different ways to produce energy services. specific objectives of this thesis were to investigate the energy efficiency and time-dependent climate impact of src willow–based bioenergy systems using different ways of converting the biomass into electricity and heat.



life cycle assessment (lca) methodology was used to enable the assessment of time-dependent climate impacts using a time-distributed inventory and a time-dependent indicator, i.e. the global mean surface temperature change (∆ts). several different ways of generating electricity and/or heat from the biomass produced at a src willow plantation were compared, taking biogenic c stock changes into account.



the main conclusions were that src willow–based bioenergy systems can be truly c negative and help contribute to counteract the current trend in global warming while delivering renewable energy at the same time. the choice of energy conversion technology affects both the energy efficiency and the potential climate impact mitigation potential of the system. biogenic c pools can have a very large influence on the climate impact in bioenergy systems. it is therefore important to take these pools into account whenever land use or management changes take place, in order to counteract global warming more effectively",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/385'],"[{'name': 'Ericsson, Niclas'}]",time-dependent climate impact of short rotation coppice willow–based systems for electricity and heat production,2015,,

331,34206442,,['oai:archive.ugent.be:7028658'],,thesis,"to mitigate climate destabilisation, global emissions of human-induced greenhouse gases urgently need to be reduced, to be nearly zeroed at the end of the century. clear targets are set at european level for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and primary energy consumption and for the integration of renewable energy. carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the industry and energy sectors account for a major share of greenhouse gas emissions. hence, a low carbon shift in industrial and business park energy systems is called for. low carbon business parks minimise energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by enhanced energy efficiency, heat recovery in and between companies, maximal exploitation of local renewable energy production, and energy storage, combined in a collective energy system. moreover, companies with complementary energy profiles are clustered to exploit energy synergies.
the design of low carbon energy systems is facilitated using the holistic approach of techno-economic energy models. these models take into account the complex interactions between the components of an energy system and assist in determining an optimal trade-off between energetic, economic and environmental performances. in this work, existing energy model classifications are scanned for adequate model characteristics and accordingly, a confined number of energy models are selected and described. subsequently, a practical categorisation is proposed, existing of energy system evolution, optimisation, simulation, accounting and integration models, while key model features are compared. next, essential features for modelling energy systems at business park scale are identified:
as a first key feature, a superstructure-based optimisation approach avoids the need for a priori decisions on the system’s configuration, since a mathematical algorithm automatically identifies the optimal configuration in a superstructure that embeds all feasible configurations. secondly, the representation of time needs to incorporate sufficient temporal detail to capture important characteristics and peaks in time-varying energy demands, energy prices and operation conditions of energy conversion technologies. thirdly, energy technologies need to be accurately represented at equipment unit level by incorporating part-load operation and investment cost subject to economy of scale in the model formulation. in addition, the benefits of installing multiple units per technology must be considered. a generic model formulation of technology models facilitates the introduction of new technology types. as a fourth important feature, the potential of thermodynamically feasible heat exchange between thermal processes needs to be exploited, while optimally integrating energy technologies to fulfil remaining thermal demands. for this purpose, thermal streams need to be represented by heat –temperature profiles. moreover, restrictions to direct heat exchange between process streams need to be taken into account. finally, the possibility for energy storage needs to be included to enhance the integration of non-dispatchable renewable energy technologies and to bridge any asynchrony between cooling and heating demands.
starting from these essential features, a techno-economic optimisation model (syn-e-sys), is developed customised for the design of low carbon energy systems on business park scale. the model comprises two sequential stages. in the first stage, heat recovery within the system is maximised, while energy supply and energy storage technologies are optimally integrated and designed to fulfil remaining energy requirements at minimum total annualised costs. predefined variations in thermal and electrical energy demand and supply are taken into account, next to a carbon emission cap. at the same time, heat networks can be deployed to transfer heat between separate parts of the system. in the second stage, the model generates an optimal multi-period heat exchanger network enabling all required heat exchanges. 
syn-e-sys builds upon a multi-period energy integration model that can deal with restrictions in heat exchange. it is combined with a generic technology model, that features part-load operation as well as investment cost subject to economy of scale, and a generic energy storage model. the technology model can be manipulated to represent various thermal or electrical energy conversion technology units, and serves as a building block to model more complex technologies. the storage model covers electrical as well as thermal energy storage, taking into account the effect of hourly energy losses on the storage level, without increasing the number of time steps to be analysed. for this purpose, time sequence is introduced by dividing the year into a set of time slices and assigning them to a hierarchical time structure. in addition, a more complex model for storage of sensible heat is integrated, consisting of a stack of interconnected virtual tanks. to enable the optimisation of the number of units per technology in the energy system configuration, an automated superstructure expansion procedure is incorporated. heat transfer unit envelope curves are calculated to facilitate the choice of appropriate temperature levels for heat networks. heat networks that are embedded within this envelope, completely avoid the increase in energy requirements that would result from the heat exchange restrictions between separated parts of the energy system. finally, the heat exchanger network is automatically generated using a multi-period stage-wise superstructure.
two problems inherent to the heat cascade formulation are encountered during model development. as a first issue, heat networks can form self-sustaining energy loops if their hot and cold streams are not completely embedded within the envelope. this phenomenon is referred to in this work as phantom heat. as a second issue, the heat cascade formulation does not prevent that a thermal storage releases its heat to a cooling technology.
to demonstrate the specific features of syn-e-sys and its holistic approach towards the synthesis of low carbon energy systems, the model is applied to a generic case study and to a case study from literature. the generic case study is set up to demonstrate the design of an energy system including non-dispatchable renewable energy and energy storage, subject to a carbon emission cap. for this purpose, the year is subdivided into a set of empirically defined time slices that are connected to a hierarchical time structure composed of seasons, daytypes and intra-daily time segments. the results obtained by syn-e-sys show a complex interaction between energy supply, energy storage and energy import/export to fulfil energy demands, while keeping carbon emissions below the predefined cap. the model enables optimisation of the intra-annual charge pattern and the capacity of thermal and electrical storage. moreover, an optimal heat exchanger network is automatically generated. in the second case study, heat recovery is optimised for a drying process in the paper industry. to avoid the energy penalty due to heat exchange restrictions between two separated process parts, heat transfer units need to be optimally integrated. firstly, a simplified version of the original problem is set up in syn-e-sys and the obtained results correspond well to literature. subsequently, the original problem is extended to demonstrate the optimal integration of heat transfer units in a multi-period situation. in conclusion, syn-e-sys facilitates optimal design of low carbon energy systems on business park scale, taking into account the complex time-varying interactions between thermal and electrical energy demand, supply and storage, while the potential for heat recovery is fully exploited",ghent university. faculty of engineering and architecture,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1493'],"[{'name': 'Timmerman, Jonas'}]",development of a techno-economic energy model for low carbon business parks,2015,,

the second class of porous structures discussed herein is diazaborole linked polymers (dblps). they are constructed based on b-n bond formation and possess amorphous structures due to the lack of the reversible bond formation processes. at this scope, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 15-hexaaminotriptycene (hatt) hexahydrocloride was synthesized and reacted with different boronic acid derivatives to produce three different porous polymers under condensation reaction conditions. dblp-3, -4 and -5 have very high surface areas; 730, 904, and 986 m2 g-1, and offer high co2 uptake (158.5, 198, and 171.5 mg g-1) at 1 bar and 273 k, respectively. dblps have much higher co2 uptake capacity when compared to almost all reported b-n and b-o containing porous polymers in the field. in addition to high co2 capacity, dblps showed remarkable co2/n2 and co2/ch4 selectivity, when the henry`s law of initial slope selectivity calculations were applied. in general, dbilps exhibit high selectivities for co2/n2 (35-51) and co2/ch4 (5-6) at 298 k which are comparable to those of most porous polymers",vcu scholars compass,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2330'],"[{'name': 'Kahveci, Zafer'}]","diazaborole linked porous polymers: design, synthesis, and application to gas storage and separation",2015,,

342,21940367,,['oai:archive.ugent.be:7028658'],,thesis,"to mitigate climate destabilisation, global emissions of human-induced greenhouse gases urgently need to be reduced, to be nearly zeroed at the end of the century. clear targets are set at european level for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and primary energy consumption and for the integration of renewable energy. carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the industry and energy sectors account for a major share of greenhouse gas emissions. hence, a low carbon shift in industrial and business park energy systems is called for. low carbon business parks minimise energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by enhanced energy efficiency, heat recovery in and between companies, maximal exploitation of local renewable energy production, and energy storage, combined in a collective energy system. moreover, companies with complementary energy profiles are clustered to exploit energy synergies.
the design of low carbon energy systems is facilitated using the holistic approach of techno-economic energy models. these models take into account the complex interactions between the components of an energy system and assist in determining an optimal trade-off between energetic, economic and environmental performances. in this work, existing energy model classifications are scanned for adequate model characteristics and accordingly, a confined number of energy models are selected and described. subsequently, a practical categorisation is proposed, existing of energy system evolution, optimisation, simulation, accounting and integration models, while key model features are compared. next, essential features for modelling energy systems at business park scale are identified:
as a first key feature, a superstructure-based optimisation approach avoids the need for a priori decisions on the system’s configuration, since a mathematical algorithm automatically identifies the optimal configuration in a superstructure that embeds all feasible configurations. secondly, the representation of time needs to incorporate sufficient temporal detail to capture important characteristics and peaks in time-varying energy demands, energy prices and operation conditions of energy conversion technologies. thirdly, energy technologies need to be accurately represented at equipment unit level by incorporating part-load operation and investment cost subject to economy of scale in the model formulation. in addition, the benefits of installing multiple units per technology must be considered. a generic model formulation of technology models facilitates the introduction of new technology types. as a fourth important feature, the potential of thermodynamically feasible heat exchange between thermal processes needs to be exploited, while optimally integrating energy technologies to fulfil remaining thermal demands. for this purpose, thermal streams need to be represented by heat –temperature profiles. moreover, restrictions to direct heat exchange between process streams need to be taken into account. finally, the possibility for energy storage needs to be included to enhance the integration of non-dispatchable renewable energy technologies and to bridge any asynchrony between cooling and heating demands.
starting from these essential features, a techno-economic optimisation model (syn-e-sys), is developed customised for the design of low carbon energy systems on business park scale. the model comprises two sequential stages. in the first stage, heat recovery within the system is maximised, while energy supply and energy storage technologies are optimally integrated and designed to fulfil remaining energy requirements at minimum total annualised costs. predefined variations in thermal and electrical energy demand and supply are taken into account, next to a carbon emission cap. at the same time, heat networks can be deployed to transfer heat between separate parts of the system. in the second stage, the model generates an optimal multi-period heat exchanger network enabling all required heat exchanges. 
syn-e-sys builds upon a multi-period energy integration model that can deal with restrictions in heat exchange. it is combined with a generic technology model, that features part-load operation as well as investment cost subject to economy of scale, and a generic energy storage model. the technology model can be manipulated to represent various thermal or electrical energy conversion technology units, and serves as a building block to model more complex technologies. the storage model covers electrical as well as thermal energy storage, taking into account the effect of hourly energy losses on the storage level, without increasing the number of time steps to be analysed. for this purpose, time sequence is introduced by dividing the year into a set of time slices and assigning them to a hierarchical time structure. in addition, a more complex model for storage of sensible heat is integrated, consisting of a stack of interconnected virtual tanks. to enable the optimisation of the number of units per technology in the energy system configuration, an automated superstructure expansion procedure is incorporated. heat transfer unit envelope curves are calculated to facilitate the choice of appropriate temperature levels for heat networks. heat networks that are embedded within this envelope, completely avoid the increase in energy requirements that would result from the heat exchange restrictions between separated parts of the energy system. finally, the heat exchanger network is automatically generated using a multi-period stage-wise superstructure.
two problems inherent to the heat cascade formulation are encountered during model development. as a first issue, heat networks can form self-sustaining energy loops if their hot and cold streams are not completely embedded within the envelope. this phenomenon is referred to in this work as phantom heat. as a second issue, the heat cascade formulation does not prevent that a thermal storage releases its heat to a cooling technology.
to demonstrate the specific features of syn-e-sys and its holistic approach towards the synthesis of low carbon energy systems, the model is applied to a generic case study and to a case study from literature. the generic case study is set up to demonstrate the design of an energy system including non-dispatchable renewable energy and energy storage, subject to a carbon emission cap. for this purpose, the year is subdivided into a set of empirically defined time slices that are connected to a hierarchical time structure composed of seasons, daytypes and intra-daily time segments. the results obtained by syn-e-sys show a complex interaction between energy supply, energy storage and energy import/export to fulfil energy demands, while keeping carbon emissions below the predefined cap. the model enables optimisation of the intra-annual charge pattern and the capacity of thermal and electrical storage. moreover, an optimal heat exchanger network is automatically generated. in the second case study, heat recovery is optimised for a drying process in the paper industry. to avoid the energy penalty due to heat exchange restrictions between two separated process parts, heat transfer units need to be optimally integrated. firstly, a simplified version of the original problem is set up in syn-e-sys and the obtained results correspond well to literature. subsequently, the original problem is extended to demonstrate the optimal integration of heat transfer units in a multi-period situation. in conclusion, syn-e-sys facilitates optimal design of low carbon energy systems on business park scale, taking into account the complex time-varying interactions between thermal and electrical energy demand, supply and storage, while the potential for heat recovery is fully exploited",ghent university. faculty of engineering and architecture,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1493'],"[{'name': 'Timmerman, Jonas'}]",development of a techno-economic energy model for low carbon business parks,2015,,

electricity production sector faces the challenge of mitigating its emissions by\ud
transitioning towards cleaner production technologies. in light of this transition, it has\ud
been shown that even though renewable energy technologies have clear benefits over\ud
fossil generation technologies, there are trade-offs from an environmental and\ud
material perspective (hertwich et al. 2015; singh et al. 2015). within the broader\ud
scope of sustainable development, care must be taken in climate change mitigation to\ud
avoid problem-shifting between environmental impacts.\ud
the aim of this thesis is to shed light on the prospective environmental impacts of\ud
low-carbon electricity production technologies. life cycle assessment (lca) was\ud
chosen as assessment method for its comprehensive scope. it is detailed enough to\ud
estimate prospective impacts with a level of detail that is typically not available for\ud
other types of environmental assessment methods. two key challenges associated\ud
with the lca of electricity technologies were identified: input data variability and\ud
uncertainty, and the challenge of matching electricity supply and demand due to\ud
intermittent solar and wind resources. it is of importance to take these challenges into\ud
account in the environmental assessment of electricity technologies.\ud
against this background, four papers are presented in this thesis. the first paper\ud
discusses the influence of fugitive methane emissions on the life cycle ghg emissions\ud
of fossil fuel based electricity generation. the other three papers investigate more\ud
closely the environmental impacts of electricity technologies, while taking into\ud
account the variability and market dispatch of supply from renewable resources.\ud
paper ii aims to quantify the additional environmental impacts of extending an\ud
offshore wind farm with compressed air energy storage (caes) for balancing\ud
purposes. the influence of economic electricity dispatch on capacity factor\ud
assumptions and environmental impacts is studied in paper iii. the prospective\ud
environmental impacts of high-renewable electricity production regimes, including\ud
intermittency and economic dispatch, are discussed in the final paper. it is shown in paper i that ghg emissions from fossil fuel power generation vary more\ud
widely than commonly acknowledged as a result of large variability in fugitive\ud
methane emissions. where co2 capture and storage (ccs) reduces the ghg emissions\ud
at power plants, it increases the upstream fugitive emissions per unit generation. the\ud
high variability in results points to a need for more measured data to reduce the\ud
uncertainty in the dataset, as well as a potential mitigation opportunity by capturing\ud
methane during fossil fuel extraction.\ud
it is shown in paper ii that the additional environmental impacts related to balancing\ud
offshore wind power with caes are limited and combined impacts are well below\ud
average grid impacts. both conventional and adiabatic caes are investigated. the\ud
majority of environmental impacts can be attributed to either the combustion of\ud
natural gas in conventional compressed air systems, or the thermal energy storage in\ud
adiabatic systems.\ud
it is shown in paper iii that the utilization of electricity technologies is determined by\ud
the economic dispatch, and is of influence on the capacity factor estimation of\ud
individual technologies. the sensitivity of impact assessment for the capacity factor\ud
estimation is large for infrastructure intensive technologies and can vary across\ud
different impact categories.\ud
it is shown in paper iv that increasing the share of renewable electricity in the mix,\ud
decreases impacts significantly. impact indicators are aggregated into a single impact\ud
according to four distinct weighting methods. large variation in impact is observed\ud
for scenarios with comparable levels of renewable electricity production, but different\ud
shares of individual technologies. specific renewable technology targets could inform\ud
the setting of renewable energy targets motivated by impact reduction.\ud
the thesis as a whole shows that, while the impacts of low-carbon electricity cannot\ud
be underestimated, there is significant environmental improvement potential related\ud
to the transition to a low-carbon electricity system. the additional environmental\ud
pressures associated with balancing electricity supply and demand appear to be\ud
relatively limited. the impact reductions achieved by additional low-carbon capacity\ud
more than outweigh the potential adverse effects related to its construction.sammendrag\ud
den globale elektrisitetsproduksjonssektoren er en av de viktigste bidragsyterne til\ud
utslipp av klimagasser (ghg) og står foran utfordringen ved å gå over til renere\ud
produksjonsteknologier for å redusere disse utslippene. selv om fornybare\ud
energiteknologier har klare fordeler sammenlignet med fossile teknologier, finnes det\ud
avveininger fra et miljø- og materialperspektiv (hertwich et al 2015;. singh et al\ud
2015). innenfor den bredere rammen av bærekraftig utvikling, må man passe på å\ud
gjennomføre klimatiltak som unngår forskyvning av problemene mellom ulike\ud
miljøpåvirkninger.\ud
målet med denne avhandlingen er å kaste lys over de potensielle miljøkonsekvensene\ud
av elektrisitetsproduksjonsteknologier med lave utslipp av klimagasser.\ud
livsyklusvurdering (lca) er valgt som vurderingsmetode på grunn av sitt omfattende\ud
omfang. det er spesifikt nok til å anslå potensielle konsekvenser med et detaljnivå\ud
som tradisjonelt ikke er tilgjengelig for andre typer miljøvurderingsmetoder. to\ud
viktige utfordringer knyttet til lca av elektrisitetsteknologier ble identifisert:\ud
variabilitet og usikkerhet fra inndata, og utfordringen med matchende\ud
elektrisitetsforsyning og -etterspørsel på grunn av uregelmessige sol- og\ud
vindressurser. det er av betydning å ta disse utfordringene i betraktning i\ud
miljøvurderinger av elektrisitetsteknologier.\ud
mot denne bakgrunnen er fire artikler presentert i denne avhandlingen. den første\ud
artikkelen diskuterer innflytelsen av metanlekkasje på klimagassutslippene forbundet\ud
med fossilbasert kraftproduksjon. de tre andre artiklene undersøker nærmere de\ud
miljømessige konsekvensene av kraftteknologier, med samtidig hensyn til variasjon av\ud
produksjon fra fornybare ressurser og økonomisk driftsplanlegging av levering. paper\ud
ii tar sikte på å kvantifisere de ekstra miljømessige konsekvensene av å utvide en\ud
vindpark nær kysten med trykkluftsbasert energilagring (caes) for\ud
balanseringsformål. påvirkningen av økonomisk driftsplanlegging på\ud
kapasitetsfaktorforutsetninger og miljøkonsekvenser er studert i paper iii. de\ud
potensielle miljømessige konsekvensene av høy-fornybare regimer, inkludert\ud
variabilitet av levering og driftsplanlegging, er omtalt i den siste artikkelen. \ud
det er vist i paper i at klimagassutslipp fra fossil kraftproduksjon varierer mer enn\ud
tradisjonelt antatt som et resultat av stor variasjon i metanutslipp. co2-fangst og\ud
lagring (ccs) reduserer klimagassutslippene på kraftverk, men øker oppstrøms behov\ud
for brennstoff og derfor også lekkasje per enhet produksjon. den høye variasjonen i\ud
resultatene peker på et behov for flere målepunkter for å redusere usikkerheten i\ud
datasettet, samt en potensiell mulighet for å redusere klimagassutslipp ved å fange\ud
metan ved utvinning av fossile brensler.\ud
det er vist i paper ii at økningen i miljøeffekter knyttet til å balansere offshore\ud
vindkraft med caes er begrenset og at totaleffektene er betydelig lavere enn\ud
gjennomsnittet for kraftproduksjon. både konvensjonell og adiabatisk caes blir\ud
undersøkt. de fleste av miljøeffektene kan tilskrives enten forbrenning av naturgass i\ud
konvensjonelle trykkluftsystemer, eller lagring av termisk energi i adiabatiske\ud
systemer.\ud
det er vist i paper iii at utnyttelsen av kraftproduksjonsteknologier er bestemt av\ud
økonomisk driftsplanlegging, og har innflytelse på estimering av kapasitetsfaktor for\ud
individuelle teknologier. miljøvurderinger av infrastruktur-intensive teknologier er\ud
følsomme for estimater av kapasitetsfaktor og kan variere mellom ulike\ud
påvirkningskategorier.\ud
det er vist i paper iv at å øke andelen av fornybar elektrisitet i miksen, reduserer\ud
miljøeffektene betydelig. miljøeffekter er samlet i henhold til fire forskjellige\ud
vektingsmetoder. stor variasjon i effektene er observert for scenarier med\ud
sammenlignbare nivåer av fornybar elektrisitetsproduksjon, men ulike andeler av de\ud
ulike teknologiene. spesifikke mål for individuelle fornybare teknologier kan forbedre\ud
utformingen av fornybare energimål motivert av miljøhensyn.\ud
avhandlingen som helhet viser at mens konsekvensene av elektrisitet med lave co2\ud
utslipp ikke bør undervurderes, er det betydelig miljøforbedringspotensial knyttet til\ud
overgangen til et kraftsystem basert på lavutslippsteknologi. de ekstra\ud
miljøbelastninger i forbindelse med behovet for å balansere kraftsystemet synes å\ud
være begrenset. gevinstene oppnådd ved ny lavutslippskapasitet mer enn oppveier de\ud

the main research contribution of this thesis is the performance evaluation of communication infrastructures for wams. the evaluation begins from inside substations and continues over wide areas from substations to control centre. through laboratory-based investigations and simulations, the performance of communications infrastructure in a typical power system substation has been analysed. in addition, the performance evaluation of wams communications infrastructure has been presented. in the modelling and analysis, an existing wams as installed on the gb transmission system has been considered. the actual pmu packets as received at the phasor data concentrator (pdc) were captured for latency analysis. a novel algorithmic procedure has been developed and implemented to automate the large-scale latency calculations. furthermore, the internal delays of pmus have been investigated, determined and analysed. subsequently, the wams has been simulated and detailed comparisons have been performed between the simulated model results and wams performance data captured from the actual wams. the validated wams model has been used for analysing possible future developments as well as to test newly proposed mechanisms, protocols, etc. in order to improve the communications infrastructure performance",brunel university london.,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/14'],"[{'name': 'Golshani, Mohammad'}]",novel performance evaluation of information and communication technologies to enable wide area monitoring systems for enhanced transmission network operation,2015,,

two issues on hens. the first concerns with designing of economically optimal
heat exchanger network (hen) whereas the second focus on optimal operation
of hen in the presence of uncertainties and disturbances within the network. in
the first issue, a pinch technology based optimal hen design is firstly
implemented on a 3–streams heat recovery case study to design a simple hen
and then, a more complex hen is designed for a coal-fired power plant retrofitted
with co2 capture unit to achieve the objectives of minimising energy penalty on
the power plant due to its integration with the co2 capture plant. the benchmark
in this case study is a stream data from (khalilpour and abbas, 2011).
improvement to their work includes: (1) the use of economic data to evaluate
achievable trade-offs between energy, capital and utility cost for determination of
minimum temperature difference; (2) redesigning of the hen based on the new
minimum temperature difference and (3) its comparison with the base case
design. the results shows that the energy burden imposed on the power plant
with co2 capture is significantly reduced through hen leading to utility cost
saving maximisation. the cost of addition of hen is recoverable within a short
payback period of about 2.8 years. in the second issue, optimal hen operation
considering range of uncertainties and disturbances in flowrates and inlet stream
temperatures while minimizing utility consumption at constant target
temperatures based on self-optimizing control (soc) strategy. the new soc
method developed in this thesis is a data-driven soc method which uses process
data collected overtime during plant operation to select control variables (cvs).
this is in contrast to the existing soc strategies in which the cv selection
requires process model to be linearized for nonlinear processes which leads to
unaccounted losses due to linearization errors. the new approach selects cvs
in which the necessary condition of optimality (nco) is directly approximated by
the cv through a single regression step. this work was inspired by ye et al.,
(2013) regression based globally optimal cv selection with no model linearization
and ye et al., (2012) two steps regression based data-driven cv selection but with poor optimal results due to regression errors in the two steps procedures.
the advantage of this work is that it doesn’t require evaluation of derivatives
hence cvs can be evaluated even with commercial simulators such as hysys
and unisim from among others. the effectiveness of the proposed method is
again applied to the 3-streams hen case study and also the hen for coal-fired
power plant with co2 capture unit. the case studies show that the proposed
methodology provides better optimal operation under uncertainties when

360,83552839,,['oai:qucosa:de:qucosa:23008'],,,"the underlying research that resulted in this doctoral dissertation was performed at the division of economic geology and petrology of the department of mineralogy, tu bergakademie freiberg between 2011 and 2014. it was the primary aim of this thesis to develop and test novel applications for the technology of ‘automated mineralogy’ in the field of economic geology and geometallurgy. a “mineral liberation analyser” (mla) instrument of fei company was used to conduct most analytical studies. this automated system is an image analysis system based on scanning electron microscopy (sem) image acquisition and energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry which can be used to determine both quantitative mineralogical data and mineral processing-relevant parameters. the analyses can be conducted with unconsolidated and solid rocks but also with ores and products of the mineral processing and recycling industry.
in consequence of a first-time broadly-based and comprehensive literature review of more than 1,700 publications related to all types of automated sem-based image analysis systems several trends in the publication chronicle were observed. publications related to mineral processing lead the field of automated mineralogy-related publications. however, this is with a somewhat smaller proportion than expected and with a significant decrease in share between around 2000 and 2014. the latter is caused by a gradual but continuous introduction of new areas of application for automated mineralogical analysis such as the petroleum industry, petrology or environmental sciences. furthermore, the quantity of automated mineralogy systems over time was carefully assessed. it is shown that the market developed from many individual developments in the 1970s and 1980s, often conducted from research institutes, e.g., csiro and jkmrc, or universities, to a duopoly - intellection pty ltd and jktech mla - in the 1990s and 2000s and finally to a monopoly by fei company since 2009. however, the number of fei’s competitors, such as zeiss, tescan, oxford instruments, and robertson cgg, and their competing systems are increasing since 2011.
particular focus of this study, published in three research articles in peer-reviewed international journals, was the development of suitable methodological approaches to deploy mla to new materials and in new contexts. data generated are then compared with data obtained by established analytical techniques to enable critical assessment and validation of the methods developed. these include both quantitative mineralogical analysis as well as methods of particle characterisation.
the first scientific paper “use of mineral liberation analysis (mla) in the characterization of lithium-bearing micas” deals with the field of mineral processing and describes the characterisation of lithium-bearing zinnwaldite mica - as potential natural resource for lithium - by mla as well as the achievement of mineralogical association data for zinnwaldite and associated minerals. two different approaches were studied to comminute the samples for this work, conventional comminution by crusher as well as high-voltage pulse selective fragmentation. by this study it is shown that the mla can provide mineral data of high quality from silicate mineral resources and results very comparable to established analytical methods. furthermore, mla yields additional relevant information - such as particle and grain sizes as well as liberation and grade-recovery data. this combination of quantitative data cannot be attained with any other single analytical method.
the second article “characterisation of graphite by automated mineral liberation analysis” is also located in the field of mineral processing. this research article is the first published contribution on the characterisation of graphite, an important industrial mineral, by mla respectively an automated mineralogy-related analytical method. during this study graphite feeds and concentrates were analysed. by this study it is shown that it is possible to gather statistically relevant data of graphite samples by mla. furthermore, the mla results are validated by quantitative x-ray powder diffraction as well as particle size determinations by laser diffraction and sieve analysis.
the third research paper “nature and distribution of pge mineralisation in gabbroic rocks of the lusatian block, saxony, germany” deals with the scientific field of geoscience. in this study it is shown that it is possible to obtain a significant body of novel mineralogical information by applying mla analysis in a region previously regarded as being well-studied. the complex nature and relatively large distribution of the occurring platinum group minerals (pgm) is well illustrated by this contribution. during previous light microscopic studies and infrequent electron microprobe measurements only a handful isolated pgm grains were identified and characterised. in this investigation, using the samples of previous studies, 7 groups of pgm and 6 groups of associated tellurides as well as in total more than 1,300 mineral grains of both mineral groups were identified. based on the data obtained, important insight regarding mineral associations, mineral paragenesis and the potential genesis of the pgm is obtained. within this context, the value of mla studies for petrological research focused on trace minerals is documented. mla yields results that are both comprehensive and unbiased, thus permitting novel insight into the distribution and characteristics of trace minerals. this, in turn, is immensely useful when developing new concepts on the genesis of trace minerals, but may also give rise to the development of a novel generation of exploration tools, i.e., mineralogical vectors towards exploration akin to currently used geochemical vectors.
the present dissertation shows that automated mineralogy by using a mineral liberation analyser is able to deliver a unique combination of quantitative data on mineralogy and several physical attributes that are relevant for ore geology and mineral processing alike. it is in particular the automation and unbiasedness of data, as well as the availability of textural data, size and shape information for particles and mineral grains, as well as mineral association and mineral liberation data that define major advantages of mla analyses - compared to other analytical methods. despite the fact that results are obtained only on 2-d polished surfaces, quantitative results obtained compare well/very well to results obtained by other analytical methods. this is attributed mainly due to the fact that a very large and statistically sound number of mineral grains/particles are analysed. similar advantages are documented when using the mla as an efficient tool to search for and characterise trace minerals of petrological or economic significance.die forschung die der vorliegenden kumulativen dissertation (‚publikationsdissertation‘) zugrunde liegt wurde im zeitraum 2011-2014 am lehrstuhl für lagerstättenlehre und petrologie des institutes für mineralogie der tu bergakademie freiberg durchgeführt. das primäre ziel dieser arbeit war es neue einsatzmöglichkeiten für die technik der automatisierten mineralogie im gebiet der lagerstättenkunde und geometallurgie zu entwickeln und zu testen. im mittelpunkt der wissenschaftlichen studien stand die analytische nutzung des großgerätes „mineral liberation analyser“ (mla) der firma fei company. dieses automatisierte system ist ein bildanalysesystem und basiert auf der erfassung von rasterelektronenmikroskopiebildern und energiedispersiver röntgen-spektroskopie. mit hilfe der mla-analysetechnik lassen sich sowohl statistisch gesichert quantitative mineralogisch relevante als auch aufbereitungsprozess-relevante parameter ermitteln. die analysen können sowohl an locker- und festgesteinen als auch an erzen und produkten der aufbereitungs- und recyclingindustrie durchgeführt werden.
infolge einer erstmaligen, breit angelegten und umfassenden literaturrecherche von mehr als 1.700 publikationen im zusammenhang mit allen arten von automatisierten rem-basierten bildanalysesystemen konnten verschiedene trends in der publikations¬historie beobachtet werden. publikationen mit bezug auf die aufbereitung mineralischer rohstoffe führen das gebiet der automatisierte mineralogie-bezogenen publikationen an. der anteil der aufbereitungs-bezogenen publikationen an der gesamtheit der relevanten publikationen ist jedoch geringer als erwartet und zeigt eine signifikante abnahme des prozentualen anteils zwischen den jahren 2000 und 2014. letzteres wird durch eine kontinuierliche einführung neuer anwendungsbereiche für die automatisierte mineralogische analyse, wie zum beispiel in der öl- und gasindustrie, der petrologie sowie den umweltwissenschaften verursacht. weiterhin wurde die anzahl der systeme der automatisierten mineralogie über die zeit sorgfältig bewertet. es wird gezeigt, dass sich der markt von vielen einzelnen entwicklungen in den 1970er und 1980er jahren, die oft von forschungsinstituten, wie z. b. csiro und jkmrc, oder universitäten ausgeführt wurden, zu einem duopol - intellection pty ltd und jktech mla - in den 1990er und 2000er jahren und schließlich seit 2009 zu einem monopol der fei company entwickelte. allerdings steigt die anzahl der fei-konkurrenten, wie zeiss, tescan, oxford instruments und robertson cgg, und deren konkurrenzsysteme seit 2011.
ein schwerpunkt der drei von experten begutachteten und in internationalen fachzeitschriften publizierten artikel dieser studie war die entwicklung eines geeigneten methodischen ansatzes um die mla-technik für neue materialien und in neuem kontext zu verwenden. die erzeugten daten wurden mit daten die von etablierten analytischen techniken gewonnen wurden verglichen, um eine kritische bewertung und validierung der entwickelten methoden zu ermöglichen. dazu gehören sowohl quantitative mineralogische analysen als auch methoden der partikelcharakterisierung.
der schwerpunkt der studie zum ersten fachartikel „use of mineral liberation analysis (mla) in the characterization of lithium-bearing micas“ liegt im gebiet der aufbereitung mineralischer rohstoffe. er beschreibt die charakterisierung von zinnwaldit-glimmer - einem potentiellen lithium-rohstoff - durch die mla-technik sowie das erringen von mineralverwachsungsdaten für zinnwaldit und assoziierter minerale. dabei wurden zwei unterschiedliche wege der probenzerkleinerung des rohstoffes untersucht. zum einen erfolgte eine konventionelle zerkleinerung der proben mittels brecher und mühle, zum anderen eine selektive zerkleinerung durch hoch¬spannungsimpulse. es konnte aufgezeigt werden, dass die automatisierte rasterelektronen¬mikroskopie-basierte bildanalyse mittels mla von silikatischen rohstoffen mineral¬informationen von hoher güte zur verfügung stellen kann und die ergebnisse gut vergleichbar mit etablierten analytischen methoden sind. zusätzlich liefert die mla weitere wertvolle informationen wie zum beispiel partikel-/mineralkorngrößen, aussagen zum mineralfreisetzungsgrad sowie gehalt-ausbring-kurven des wertstoffes. diese kombination von quantitativen daten kann mit keiner anderen analytischen einzelmethode erreicht werden.
der zweite fachartikel „characterisation of graphite by automated mineral liberation analysis“ ist ebenfalls im fachgebiet der aufbereitung mineralischer rohstoffe angesiedelt. während dieser studie wurden edukte und produkte der aufbereitung von graphit-erzen untersucht. der vorliegende artikel ist der erste in einer internationalen fachzeitschrift publizierte beitrag zur charakterisierung des industrieminerals graphit mittels mla-technik bzw. einer analysenmethode der automatisierten mineralogie. mit der studie konnte gezeigt werden, dass es möglich ist, auch mit der mla statistisch relevante daten von graphitproben zu erfassen. darüber hinaus wurden die ergebnisse der mla-analysen durch quantitative röntgenpulverdiffraktometrie sowie partikelgrößen-bestimmungen durch laserbeugung und siebanalyse validiert.
der dritte fachartikel „nature and distribution of pge mineralisation in gabbroic rocks of the lusatian block, saxony, germany“ ist im gegensatz zu den ersten beiden artikeln im gebiet der geowissenschaften angesiedelt. in dieser studie wird gezeigt, dass es möglich ist mittels mla-analyse eine signifikante anzahl neuer daten von einem eigentlich schon gut untersuchten arbeitsgebiet zu gewinnen. so konnte erst mit der mla die komplexe natur und relativ große verbreitung der auftretenden platingruppenelement-führenden minerale (pgm) geklärt werden. während früherer lichtmikroskopischer analysen und einzelner elektronenstrahlmikrosonden-messungen konnten nur eine handvoll weniger, isolierter pgm-körner nachgewiesen und halbquantitativ charakterisiert werden. in der vorliegenden studie konnten nun, an den von früheren studien übernommenen proben, 7 pgm-gruppen und 6 assoziierte telluridmineral-gruppen mit insgesamt mehr als 1.300 mineralkörnern beider mineralgruppen nachgewiesen werden. auf der grundlage der gewonnenen daten wurden wichtige erkenntnisse in bezug auf mineralassoziationen, mineralparagenese und zur möglichen genese der pgm erreicht. in diesem zusammenhang wurde der wert der mla-studien für petrologische forschung mit dem fokus auf spurenminerale dokumentiert. die mla liefert ergebnisse, die sowohl umfassend und unvoreingenommen sind, wodurch neue einblicke in die verteilung und charakteristika der spurenminerale erlaubt werden. dies wiederum ist ungemein nützlich für die entwicklung neuer konzepte zur genese von spurenmineralen, kann aber auch zur entwicklung einer neuen generation von explorationswerkzeugen führen, wie zum beispiel mineralogische vektoren zur rohstofferkundung ähnlich wie derzeit verwendete geochemische vektoren.
mit der vorliegenden dissertationsschrift wird aufgezeigt, dass automatisierte mineralogie mittels mineral liberation analyser eine einzigartige kombination an quantitativen daten zur mineralogie und verschiedene physikalische attribute, relevant sowohl für die lagerstättenforschung als auch für die aufbereitung mineralischer rohstoffe, liefern kann. im vergleich zu anderen etablierten analytischen methoden sind es insbesondere die automatisierung und unvoreingenommenheit der daten sowie die verfügbarkeit von gefügedaten, größen- und forminformationen für partikel und mineralkörner, daten zu mineralassoziationen und mineralfreisetzungen welche die großen vorteile der mla-analysen definieren. trotz der tatsache, dass die ergebnisse nur von polierten 2-d oberflächen erhalten werden, lassen sich die quantitativen ergebnisse gut/sehr gut mit ergebnissen anderer analysemethoden vergleichen. dies kann vor allem der tatsache zugeschrieben werden, dass eine sehr große und statistisch solide anzahl von mineralkörnern/partikeln analysiert wird. ähnliche vorteile sind bei der verwendung der mla als effizientes werkzeug für die suche und charakterisierung von spurenmineralen von petrologischer oder wirtschaftlicher bedeutung dokumentiert",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/12972'],"[{'name': 'Sandmann, Dirk'}]",method development in automated mineralogy,2015,,

the last ten years have seen a growth in marine and maritime policymaking within the european union with a key feature being the concept of the ecosystem approach to guide sustainable use of the seas. in view of this increasing focus on coherent marine and maritime policy and governance within the eu, as well as globally, the easac council decided in december 2013 to conduct a study on the issue of marine sustainability. this decision particularly acknowledged the need to provide advice from the point of view of the european science academies on this new direction of marine policy and to highlight the particular challenges that this poses to the organisation of science. 
the report has the aim of contributing to the governance challenge of how to integrate the various aspects of marine policy (fisheries management, biodiversity conservation and marine environmental protection) as part of a coherent ecosystem approach. it considers how current science knowledge on marine ecosystems and the organisation of science can support an integrated approach to management of the seas. the report looks at a number of key aspects for sustainable development in changing oceans and seas, and particularly highlights the key scientific challenges in addressing these issues. the report presents both recommendations from science for policy development, and recommendations on policy for science.

rheology, multi- phase flow and heat transport (thm- model). goal of this work is to improve existing approaches fundamentally by elaborating a better, dynamic rheological model as well as developing tools to improve the comparison between simulation and observations on field and laboratory scale. this work contains the derivation and implementation of a two- surface plastic damage model, a method to detect a numerical analog for acoustic emissions in rock samples and a simulation of earthquake swarms in western bohemia. the developed damage model outnumbers existing approaches in terms of a realistic reproduction of experimental measurements and will be usefull for future simulations of drained and undrained rock deformations. especially if the rock is subjected to cyclic load or pore pressure, damage effects are essential. in fluid- rock systems this can often be the case due to temporarily increasing and decreasing fluid pressure. reoccurring, fluid- driven earthquake swarms and stimulation of geothermal fields with hydrofracturing are examples for this. acoustic emissions (ae) and (micro-) seismic events contain important information on a very local range which can not be resolved by other measurement techniques. on the other hand, there is no physical property directly related to ae. in this work i present a straightforward mechanism to obtain a proxy for acoustic emissions during a numerical simulation which agrees very well with laboratory measurements. the same mechanism can be extended to field scale for detecting and localizing earthquakes. i present an application of this method to the 2008 earthquake swarm in west- bohemia (czech republic). using the developed method i am abel reproduce the localization, temporal evolution and magnitude distribution of the original earthquake catalog. the projects examined in this thesis are suitable over a wide range of use cases. industrial applications like geothermal energy or co2 sequestration can profit from presented methods and natural phenomena like earthquake swarms can be examined in more detail. several aspects of this work are not even limited to geoscience and can be helpful in other subjects like material science and civil engineering. to validate and enable a reasonable usage of the theoretical model a numerical implementation is presented for all developed models.in

résumé peut être lue en pdf.plusieurs rapports d’organismes internationaux tels que l’agence internationale de l’énergie (aie) et le

groupe intergouvernemental d’experts sur l’évolution du climat (giec) ont confirmé que le réchauffement

climatique est indiscutable et trouve son origine dans l’activité humaine. en même temps, d’ici 2040, l’aie

prévoit une augmentation de la demande énergétique mondiale de 37 %. bien que le choix des politiques

et les évolutions du marché devraient entraîner une baisse de la demande pour les combustibles fossiles,

ceci ne suffira pas à enrayer l’augmentation des émissions de dioxyde de carbone, ce qui provoquera une

accélération de la hausse de la température mondiale de 3:6 _c à long terme. le giec estime donc que pour

limiter cette hausse à 2 _c, objectif adopté au niveau international pour prévenir les répercussions les plus

graves du changement climatique, le monde ne devra pas émettre plus de 1000 gt co2 à compter de 2014.

selon les deux organismes, environ 14 % des émissions seront réduites grâce à l’emploi de la technologie

du captage et stockage du co2. bien que cette technologie ne soit pas universellement reconnue parmi les

agences de protection de l’environnement et les ong, elle est la seule méthode à court terme qui permettrait

d’avoir un impact significatif sur le bilan carbone et il y a maintenant une urgence pour le déploiement du

csc au-delà de la phase démonstrative. pour que le stockage géologique du co2 ait un impact positif sur

l’environnement, le co2 doit être stocké dans le sous-sol aussi longtemps qu’il le faut pour que les émissions

anthropologiques chutent à des niveaux acceptables et dans des roches réservoirs permettant d’accueillir

des volumes importants de co2. ces contraintes nécessitent que le co2 soit stocké sur une échelle de temps

de l’ordre de 101 à 104 ans. pour atteindre cette exigence, on doit s’assurer que le co2 reste en place et ne

puisse migrer sur de grandes distances ni verticalement ni horizontalement.

à partir de ces constats, cette thèse propose une méthodologie de travail pour la surveillance sismique

temporelle et l’évaluation de l’incertitude liée à l’injection du co2 adaptée à un environnement avec des

faibles porosités et perméabilités, comme celui des basses-terres du st-laurent (btsl) au québec, canada.

cette méthodologie est menée sur deux fronts: utiliser les mesures de laboratoire et la modélisation sismique

de puits comme outils de haute résolution pour évaluer la réponse sismique due à l’injection du co2 et définir

une séquence logique de modélisation stochastique d’un réservoir potentiel pour la séquestration géologique

du co2. premièrement, les mesures de laboratoire sur deux échantillons provenant des unités réservoir

de btsl ont permis d’évaluer la réponse sismique due à l’injection du co2 sous différentes conditions de

pression et température. ces mesures ont permis de calibrer le modèle géologique utilisé ensuite dans la

modélisation sismique de puits. cette modélisation a montré que les différences rencontrées aux différents

temps sont quantifiables principalement par un délai de 30 ms associé à une diminution des vitesses quand

le co2 supercritique remplace la saumure dans l’espace poreux.

ensuite, la modélisation numérique basée sur un modèle hétérogène réaliste de l’aquifère salin des bstl

indique qu’ à partir des données statiques initiales, l’approche d’inversion stochastique par déformation

graduelle permet d’obtenir des estimations fidèles des propriétés physiques ainsi qu’une prédiction fiable de

la distribution du co2 dans le réservoir. .abstractthe symbols and special characters used in the original abstract could not be transcribed due

climate change (ipcc) confirmed that global warming is undeniable and originates from human activity.

following the 4ds iea scenario, global energy demand is set to grow by 37 % by 2040. while policy choices

and market developments bring the share of fossil fuels in primary energy demand down to just under

three-quarters by 2040, they are not enough to stem the rise in energy-related co2 emissions, which grow

by one-fifth. this puts the world on a path consistent with a long-term global average temperature increase

of 3:6 _c. the ipcc estimates that in order to limit this temperature increase to 2 _c – the internationally

agreed goal to avert the most severe and widespread implications of climate change – the world cannot

emit more than around 1000 gigatonnes of co2 from 2014 onwards. according to iea and ipcc, carbon

capture and storage (ccs) technology could reduce co2 emissions by 20 % of co2. this decade is critical

for moving ccs through and beyond the demonstration phase. this means that urgent action is required,

beginning now, from industry and governments to develop technology and the required business models,

and to implement incentive frameworks that can help drive ccs deployment in the power sector and

industrial applications. if ccs is to have a positive environmental impact then the injected co2 must be

stored in geological reservoirs allowing to accommodate huge volumes of co2 for as long as it takes for

anthropogenic output rates to drop to acceptable levels and for the carbon cycle to have recovered and

stabilized in geological reservoirs. this constraint requires co2 to be stored for timescales of the order of

104 or even 104 years. to meet this requirement we must ensure that it is not possible for injected co2 to

migrate on large distances either vertically or horizontally away from the targeted reservoir.

on the basis of these observations, this thesis proposes a workflow for the timelapse seismic monitoring

and the uncertainty assessment of the co2 injection suited to the environment in which porosities and

permeabilities are very low such as the st. lawrence lowlands (québec, canada) context. this two-pronged

approach use first laboratory measurements and vertical seismic profiling as high resolution tool in order to

assess the seismic response generated by co2 injections. then, a logical sequence of stochastic modeling of

a potential reservoir for co2 sequestration is defined. laboratory measurements on two geological samples

from the reservoir units of the st lawrence lowlands has allowed to assess the seismic response under

various temperature and pressions conditions. the results obtained have helped to calibrate the geological

model employed in the seismic modeling step. the results of the seismic modeling showed that the seismic

signature of the co2 is mainly observable by a delay of 30 ms related to a decrease in the wave velocities

when supercritical co2 replace brine in the pore space.

numerical experiments based on a realistic heterogeneous saline aquifer model indicates that, given initial

399,92504944,,['oai:zaguan.unizar.es:30665'],,,"la combustión indirecta con transportadores sólidos de oxígeno (chemical looping combustion, clc) es una de las tecnologías más prometedoras de captura de co2 en el proceso de producción de energía a partir de combustibles fósiles ya que la separación del co2 generado es inherente al propio proceso y, por tanto, permite reducir en gran medida el coste asociado a la captura de dicho gas. esta tecnología se fundamenta en la transferencia de oxígeno del aire al combustible por medio de un óxido metálico que actúa como transportador de oxígeno evitando el contacto directo entre el aire y el combustible. este transportador de oxígeno circula entre dos lechos fluidizados interconectados denominados reactor de reducción y reactor de oxidación. la fase activa de un transportador de oxígeno se compone de un óxido metálico, normalmente óxidos de níquel, cobre, manganeso o hierro. este trabajo de investigación se ha centrado en la evaluación del comportamiento de transportadores de oxígeno con bajo o nulo contenido en nio en el proceso clc cuando se utiliza ch4 u otros gases combustibles en presencia de h2s como impureza. la evaluación de estos transportadores de oxígeno se llevó a cabo en una planta piloto de dos lechos fluidizados interconectados de 500 wt. como objetivo final se ha pretendido identificar el transportador de oxígeno más prometedor para su escalado a una planta industrial clc de gas natural. a partir del estado del arte en el desarrollo de materiales, se escogieron cuatro transportadores de oxígeno con unas propiedades adecuadas para la combustión de gases, tales como gas natural, gas de síntesis o hidrocarburos ligeros mediante el proceso clc, uno por cada uno de los óxidos metálicos más usados para esta tecnología: materiales basados en níquel, cobre, manganeso y hierro. los resultados obtenidos con el transportador de oxígeno basado en níquel con un contenido en nio muy reducido (11 % en peso), y soportado sobre  caal2o4, demostraron que este material era altamente reactivo con todos los gases empleados obteniéndose altas eficacias de combustión en un rango bien definido de condiciones de operación. sin embargo, este transportador de oxígeno presentó algunos inconvenientes para su uso en una planta clc a nivel industrial relacionados con la posible presencia de azufre en el combustible alimentado a dicha instalación así como la necesidad de desarrollar y fabricar un soporte de caal2o4 a nivel comercial con mejores propiedades físicas [1,2]. el transportador de oxígeno basado en manganeso presentó un buen comportamiento para el proceso clc con combustibles gaseosos en términos de reactividad y eficacia de combustión cuando no existía presencia de azufre en la composición del combustible alimentado. se observó que era necesario trabajar con un exceso de oxígeno muy grande con respecto al valor estequiométrico (phi > 11) para quemar completamente el combustible y que, en estas condiciones, la generación de o2 gaseoso por descomposición, característico del proceso clou de este material, resultaba determinante para alcanzar dicho objetivo. sin embargo, la presencia de h2s en el gas combustible produjo la desactivación del transportador de oxígeno en términos de un importante descenso en la reactividad y capacidad clou del material, provocando una caída drástica de la eficacia de combustión al pasar de combustión completa a un valor del 72 % en apenas 17 horas de operación con adición de h2s. además, la presencia de este contaminante generó ciertos problemas operacionales en términos de aglomeración [3].    el transportador de oxígeno basado en cobre exhibió un comportamiento no idóneo cuando el gas combustible alimentado a la planta clc tenía h2s en concentraciones superiores a 1300 ppmv. en este sentido, las emisiones de so2 a la salida del reactor de oxidación superaban el límite de emisiones impuesto por la ue y se acumulaba azufre en las partículas del material bajo todas las condiciones de operación. no obstante, durante todos los ensayos experimentales este material mantuvo una alta reactividad y una baja velocidad de atrición sin presencia de aglomeración [4].    el transportador de oxígeno basado en hierro, y preparado por el método de impregnación húmeda incipiente sobre gal2o3, presentó un comportamiento óptimo para la combustión de gas natural con presencia de h2s, incluso para la combustión de sour gas y acid gas con concentraciones muy elevadas de este contaminante [4,5,6]. además, este material exhibió una elevada estabilidad mecánica, térmica y química durante largos periodos de operación en continuo en una planta clc, así como una alta reactividad bajo diferentes condiciones de operación. en este sentido, el inventario de sólidos necesario para quemar gas natural resultó ser muy bajo en comparación con otros transportadores de oxígeno basados en hierro estudiados en la literatura.  finalmente, esta tesis doctoral se concluyó con los estudios cinéticos de las reacciones de oxidación y reducción de los transportadores de manganeso y hierro con o2, ch4, h2 y co [7,8]. además, a partir de los resultados obtenidos, y teniendo también en cuenta los datos cinéticos de los transportadores de oxígeno basados en níquel y cobre, se estimaron las velocidades de circulación e inventarios de sólidos necesarios en un sistema clc para cada uno de los cuatro materiales seleccionados. en todos los casos, los inventarios de sólidos fueron bastante reducidos en comparación con otros transportadores de oxígeno basados en dichos metales, lo cual corroboró la elevada reactividad de los mismos. en respuesta al objetivo final de este trabajo, se identificó al transportador de oxígeno basado en hierro como aquel que presentaba el mejor comportamiento en términos globales para la combustión de gas natural en presencia de h2s como impureza. por ello, se propone para su escalado a una planta industrial clc de gas natural. 1. gayan p, cabello a, garcia-labiano f, abad a, de diego lf, adanez j. performance of a low ni content oxygen carrier for fuel gas combustion in a continuous clc unit

anthropogenic carbon dioxide (co2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. here we describe data sets and a methodology to quantify all major components of the global carbon budget, including their uncertainties, based on the combination of a range of data, algorithms, statistics, and model estimates and their interpretation by a broad scientific community. we discuss changes compared to previous estimates as well as consistency within and among components, alongside methodology and data limitations. co2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry (eff) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (eluc), mainly deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land-cover-change data, fire activity associated with deforestation, and models. the global atmospheric co2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (gatm) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. the mean ocean co2 sink (socean) is based on observations from the 1990s, while the annual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean models. the variability in socean is evaluated with data products based on surveys of ocean co2 measurements. the global residual terrestrial co2 sink (sland) is estimated by the difference of the other terms of the global carbon budget and compared to results of independent dynamic global vegetation models forced by observed climate, co2, and land-cover change (some including nitrogen–carbon interactions). we compare the mean land and ocean fluxes and their variability to estimates from three atmospheric inverse methods for three broad latitude bands. all uncertainties are reported as ±1σ, reflecting the current capacity to characterise the annual estimates of each component of the global carbon budget. for the last decade available (2005–2014), eff was 9.0 ± 0.5 gtc yr−1, eluc was 0.9 ± 0.5 gtc yr−1, gatm was 4.4 ± 0.1 gtc yr−1, socean was 2.6 ± 0.5 gtc yr−1, and sland was 3.0 ± 0.8 gtc yr−1. for the year 2014 alone, eff grew to 9.8 ± 0.5 gtc yr−1, 0.6 % above 2013, continuing the growth trend in these emissions, albeit at a slower rate compared to the average growth of 2.2 % yr−1 that took place during 2005–2014. also, for 2014, eluc was 1.1 ± 0.5 gtc yr−1, gatm was 3.9 ± 0.2 gtc yr−1, socean was 2.9 ± 0.5 gtc yr−1, and sland was 4.1 ± 0.9 gtc yr−1. gatm was lower in 2014 compared to the past decade (2005–2014), reflecting a larger sland for that year. the global atmospheric co2 concentration reached 397.15 ± 0.10 ppm averaged over 2014. for 2015, preliminary data indicate that the growth in eff will be near or slightly below zero, with a projection of −0.6 [range of −1.6 to +0.5] %, based on national emissions projections for china and the usa, and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the global economy for the rest of the world. from this projection of eff and assumed constant eluc for 2015, cumulative emissions of co2 will reach about 555 ± 55 gtc (2035 ± 205 gtco2) for 1870–2015, about 75 % from eff and 25 % from eluc. this living data update documents changes in the methods and

403,23302472,,['oai:lib.dr.iastate.edu:etd-5377'],,,"this thesis investigates the implication of empirical grounded electric power market facts using multiple methodologies, including market and contract design, analytic method, statistical method, and agent-based simulation method. basically, this thesis focuses on centrally-managed electric power markets.
european and u.s. electricity sectors have undergone substantial restructuring over the past twenty years. they have devolved from highly regulated systems operated by vertically integrated utilities to relatively decentralized systems based more fully on market valuation and allocation mechanisms.
these restructuring efforts have been driven by a desire to ensure efficient energy production and utilization, reliable energy supplies, affordable energy prices, and effective rules and regulations for environmental protection. in keeping with the latter goal, a dramatic change is taking place in energy mixes: namely, a rapid penetration of variable energy resources combined with a movement away from traditional thermal generation.
variable energy resources (vers) are renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar power, whose generation cannot be closely controlled to match changes in load or to meet other system requirements. consequently, the integration of vers tends to increase the volatility of net load (ie, load minus as-available generation) as well as the frequency of strong ramp events. flexibility in service provision by other types of resources then becomes increasingly important to maintain the reliability and efficiency of power system operations.
to accommodate increased ver penetration, tsos and isos have introduced major changes in their market rules and operational procedures. these changes have included new product definitions to enhance load-following capability (eg, ramping products), revised market eligibility requirements to encourage greater ver participation, and the introduction of capacity markets in an attempt to ensure sufficient thermal generation as a backstop for the intermittency of ver generation.
also, co2 emission issues are increasing important in electric power markets. in the u.s., the largest source of co2 emissions is the electricity sector, which was responsible for 32% of total emissions in 2012. the obama administration proposed a clean power plan in june 2014; nationwide, by 2030, this plan would achieve approximately 30 percent of co2 emission reduction relative to 2005 co2 emission levels in the power sector. there are several important issues arising from carbon mitigation options such as a carbon tax imposition and increase penetration of vers need to be resolved.
chapter 2 introduces standardized energy and reserve contracts with swing (flexibility) in their contractual terms to resolve key issues that have arisen for centrally-managed wholesale electric power markets with increased penetration of renewable energy resources. concrete examples are used to demonstrate how the trading of these standardized contracts can be supported by linked forward markets in a manner that permits efficient real-time balancing of net load subject to system and reserve-requirement constraints. comparisons with existing wholesale electric power markets are given, and key policy implications are highlighted.
chapter 3 extends the system pattern short-term forecasting method for power systems to incorporate non-dispatchable renewable energy, thus permitting the forecasting of co2 emissions along with the forecasting of prices, line congestion, and other system variables. it also develops an empirically-based system pattern transition matrix permitting a dynamic extension of the method. the practical usefulness of the resulting extended forecasting method is illustrated by means of a 5-bus test system based on data from the midcontinent independent system operator (miso).
chapter 4 develops a 9-zone test system based on miso data for application in electric power market studies. this 9-zone test system models miso\u27s original seven midwestern zones together with two recently-incorporated southern zones operating over a 15-line ac transmission grid. generators with different fuel types and capacities submit hourly supply offers in a day-ahead market (dam). load-serving entities submit hourly demand bids into a day-ahead market in the form of a 24-hour regional load profile. this 9-zone test system allows a wide range of sensitivity studies. to illustrate the capabilities of the 9-zone test system, this study undertakes a comparative study of dam locational marginal price (lmp) outcomes for miso prior to and after the integration of the two southern zones by conducting test-bed simulations for 7-zone and 9-zone test cases based on miso data.
chapter 5 analyzes how the imposition of a carbon tax and the increased penetration of wind power in such markets could impact co2 emissions and other key outcomes, such as energy dispatch, energy prices, market participant profits (by fuel type), and government tax revenues. another innovation of this part is that the effects of increases in a carbon tax and wind power penetration are studied jointly. it is shown, for example, that co2 emissions decrease from 0.23% to 6.17% as the carbon tax and the degree of wind penetration are systematically varied from a base case of zero tax and zero wind. the profits of coal- and oil-fired generation systematically decrease with increases in the carbon tax and/or increases in wind penetration, but the profits of other types of generation exhibit a more complex response. comparisons with current miso conditions are also given, and key policy implications are discussed",iowa state university digital repository,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/976'],"[{'name': 'Heo, Deung-Yong Yong'}]",studies on electric power markets: preparing for the penetration of renewable resources,2015,,

biomasa) con captura de co2 según el proceso denominado clou (chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling) en un sistema en continuo. en este caso se pretende utilizar la propiedad del cuo en un transportador de oxígeno para generar o2 gaseoso. el plan de trabajo llevado a cabo para cumplir el objetivo comenzó con el desarrollo y caracterización de diferentes transportadores de oxígeno basados en cuo adecuados para la combustión de combustibles sólidos (carbón o biomasa) mediante el proceso clou. se prepararon distintos materiales con diferentes contenidos en cuo, distintos soportes y utilizando varios métodos de preparación. estos materiales se caracterizaron química y físicamente por diferentes técnicas: sem-edx, xrd, porosimetría de mercurio, adsorción de n2 (bet), picnometría de he y determinación de la resistencia mecánica. además, se determinó la reactividad de cada material tanto para el proceso de generación de oxígeno como para su regeneración.  en el instituto de carboquímica se realizó inicialmente una caracterización de los transportadores de cuo preparados por impregnación húmeda incipiente, extrusión, compresión y spray drying por medio de la medida de sus reactividades redox en n2 y aire en tga y su resistencia mecánica. también se determinó su capacidad de desprender oxígeno gaseoso a diferentes temperaturas, junto a la velocidad de atrición y la tendencia a la aglomeración durante un alto número de ciclos redox n2-aire en un reactor de lecho fluidizado discontinuo [1]. una vez seleccionados los mejores candidatos se llevó a cabo una segunda caracterización de transportadores de oxígeno basados en cobre preparados por un método industrial como es el spray drying. uno de los materiales seleccionados contiene un 60% de cuo y se utilizó mgal2o4 como material inerte. este material se caracterizó tanto física como químicamente [2]. el resto de materiales seleccionados contenían un 40% de cuo y como inertes se emplearon mgal2o4, sio2 y tio2, tanto puros como mezclas de ellos en diferentes proporciones [3]. este trabajo se desarrolló durante una estancia en la universidad tecnológica de chalmers (gotemburgo, suecia). los transportadores preparados se caracterizaron química y físicamente por diferentes técnicas y se determinó su reactividad y su capacidad de desprender oxígeno gaseoso a diferentes temperaturas. también se evaluó la velocidad de atrición y la tendencia a la aglomeración durante un alto número de ciclos redox en un reactor de lecho fluidizado discontinuo. de todo este proceso se seleccionó un transportador de oxígeno que cumplía todas las condiciones para ser usado como transportador de oxígeno en el proceso clou: alta reactividad, baja velocidad de atrición y sin tendencia a la aglomeración. posteriormente, se analizó la capacidad de este transportador de oxígeno para convertir un combustible sólido (carbón y char) en un reactor de lecho fluidizado discontinuo [4]. adicionalmente, se analizó su máxima velocidad de generación oxígeno en función de la temperatura de reacción. se encontró que el transportador de oxígeno era capaz de producir oxígeno en condiciones de equilibrio en todas las condiciones operacionales analizadas, incluso cuando las conversiones del transportador de oxígeno eran altas. este transportador de oxígeno se utilizó en una la planta en continuo consistente en dos reactores de lecho fluidizado interconectados con una potencia de 1.5 kwt, donde se demostró por primera vez durante más de 45 horas el proceso clou quemando un carbón bituminoso [5]. se determinaron las eficacias de combustión y captura de co2, así como el efecto de las principales variables de operación. una vez demostrada la viabilidad del proceso con este material, se estudió en la planta en continuo el efecto de distintos tipos de combustibles sólidos en el proceso clou [6]. se usaron carbones de reactividades muy diferentes: un lignito, dos carbones bituminosos y una antracita. con los datos obtenidos se realizó un estudio de los inventarios de sólido mínimos necesarios para tener una alta eficacia de captura de co2 con diferentes combustibles. también se llevó a cabo la evaluación del proceso clou cuando se utiliza un combustible renovable como la biomasa, obteniéndose unos resultados muy prometedores respecto a la eficacia de captura de co2 y del inventario necesario [7]. continuando con el desarrollo del proceso clou, se llevó a cabo un estudio del efecto del azufre presente en el combustible [8]. para ello se utilizó en la planta en continuo un lignito con alto contenido en azufre (5.2% en peso) y se analizaron las emisiones de contaminantes, así como su posible efecto en el transportador de oxígeno.  también se realizó una comparativa entre los procesos ig-clc y clou con los resultados obtenidos en la planta en continuo con diferentes combustibles sólidos [9]. se analizaron las diferencias en las eficacias de combustión y captura de co2 para tres carbones de diferente rango en ambos procesos. además, se analizaron las diferencias en las velocidades de conversión de char por ambos procesos para relacionarlas con las diferencias encontradas en las eficiencias. finalmente, se realizó un modelo para el diseño básico de los reactores de reducción y oxidación de un proceso clou. para calcular los inventarios mínimos de solidos necesarios se estudió la cinética de las reacciones de reducción y oxidación del transportador desarrollado [10] en la tga. con los datos cinéticos obtenidos, se realizó una optimización del inventario necesario tanto en el reactor de reducción como en el de oxidación para alcanzar elevados valores de captura de co2 usando diferentes combustibles sólidos.  1.	p. gayán, i.

the total emissions calculated for durban in 2013, was 12 219 118 tco₂e, of which the road transport sector contributed the most to total emissions (43%), followed by industry electricity consumption (30%) a high emissions zone was identified along the coast, from durban south, through the central business district (cbd) and the north to umhlanga. specifically, the areas with the highest emissions activities are from energy-intensive manufacturing industries in south durban, and road transport, specifically private passenger cars, in central and north durban. furthermore, the highest emitting area, prospecton, (767 172 tco₂e), emitted ~ 6.5 times more than the durban ward average (118 632 tco₂e). furthermore, prospecton is highlighted for further port, fuel, chemical and petrochemicals, transport equipment manufacturing, and logistics development. the lowest emissions were from the rural edges, where the neighbourhoods emitted ~11 times less than the durban average, which are also the areas with the most developmental needs, therefore highlighting the spatial disparity in emissions contribution within the city.
a three-pronged approach of specific mitigation measures are recommended to simultaneously reduce emissions and achieve development: (i) manufacturing industries in south durban must invest in carbon offset projects in the rural periphery to ensure that the development of those areas are not associated with increasing emissions, (ii) the implementation of car-free roads in central and north durban to reduce distances travelled by private cars and to also ensure the widespread use of the integrated rapid public transport network and other eco-mobility options, (iii) limit industrial expansion in south durban and commercial and residential developments in north durban which do not have a low carbon plan. thus, the spatially-resolved emissions inventory generated emissions profiles which identified suitable mitigation strategies to assist with the transition to a low carbon city",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2118'],"[{'name': 'Jagarnath, Meryl.'}]",identifying opportunities for low carbon emission zones in south africa : a case study of durban.,2015,,

 realistic option for its application. the subject of research are neogene (upper miocene)
 sandstone hydrocarbon reservoirs in the sava depression, represented by the ivanić field case
 study. teoretical storage capacity for some aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs in the
 republic of croatia has been assesed on 188.83·106 t within the 6th framework programme
 projects (fp6), castor and geocapacity. calculation was made by using a simplified
 methodology based on data on ultimate recoverably reserves. the storage capacity for the
 ivanić field is assessed on 5.4λ6·106 t. for more accurate assessment distribution of
 petrophysical parameters must be done, which is possible by using different geostatistical,
 deterministic and stochastic, assessment methods. within the scope of dissertation, variogram
 analysis and mapping of the ivanić field's reservoir variables were done. calculated volume of
 co2 which can be injected after the enhanced oil recovery (eor) project, up to conditions
 of initial reservoir pressure, is on the level of 13.722·106 t. it was also simulated using
 material balance equation for produced and injected fluid in the mbal program module.
 obtained value (3.705·106 t) is of the practical capacity level.
 co2 geologic storage system must allow permanent and safe disposal of co2 (of the
 order of 104-105 years). although migration of co2 through active and abandoned wells,
 fractures and faults is a real possibility, these issues are well investigated so far, such attention
 has not been paid to reservoir seal rocks migration pathway. probability of preserving
 reservoirs saturated by co2 is done by applying the probability of successful discovery
 methodology (probability of success, abbr. pos). by testing seal rocks permeability the
 hypothesis of the need for laboratory tests was justified and for that purpose, in the scope of
 dissertation, an innovation „chambers for testing of isolator rocks impermeability for carbondioxide
 accumulated in reservoir below seal"" was designed, which was awarded with a silver
 medal at the international exhibition of innovation and modernization, inova 2013.
 temporary, the patent is under verification of the satate authority institution.
 mineral trapping mechanism is the safest mechanism for permanent co2 retention, but
 due to long process, this phenomenon is still quite unexplored. possibility of mineral trapping
 for the sava depression’s hydrocarbon reservoirs is done by analogy with published data of
 other projects. sandstones composed of quartz, dolomite and k-feldspar, as it is case in the
 target sandstones may be considered favorable for mineralization, but there is no significant
 co2 binding capacity due to lack of alkaline earth metals (ca and mg) and/or mafic rocks
 fragments. given that some clay minerals, (such as anorthite, zeolite, smectite, etc) are
 considered reactive, mineralisation may occur in transitional lithofacies. accurate assessment
 could be obtained after many years of research in controlled laboratory conditions. in co2
 geological storage the temperature represents an important factor because it significantly
 affects fluid physical properties, interaction of the co2-reservoir fluid-rock system, the
 trapping mechanisms, and the storage safety. for the effective co2 storage pressure and
 temperature must be above supercritical. however, vilarrasa et al. (2013) analysed
 changes in stress caused by injecting cold co2, and concluded that injection of liquid co2 is
 more favorable regarding energy efficiency and seal rock mechanical stability. the changes in
 fluid pressure and temperature can lead to gas phase appearance causing different problems.
 modelling of co2 pipeline transportation was done in a specialized software (hysys) by
 using a part of exsisting pipeline system. the transportation conditions were carefully selected
 to achieve a balance between transport safety, storage efficiency and migration risk reduction.
 the values of the inlet temperature (40 ° c, 65 ° c and 80 ° c) and inlet pressure (140 bar,
 180 bar and 200 bar) were carefully chosen to meet criteria of pipeline transportation in
 supercritical state and its injection into the reservoir in liquid state. simulation results showed
 that for the fluid phase preservation, a sufficient supply is needed because, due to the pipeline
 lenght, the heat transfer coefficient significantly influences the change in phase equilibria.
 preservation of supercritical fluid flow requires huge energy demand for heating, putting into
 question project's viability. in order to maintain fluid temperature through the selected
 pipeline system, mass flow should be greater than 20 000 kg/ h. regarding power
 consumption, temperature of 40 ° c and pressure of 140 bar was selected as most suitable.

419,51222153,,,,,"the increasing demand for electricity, the rising price of energy from conventional sources and limited electricity supply are a global concern. the demand on electricity generation could be alleviated by diversifying the sources from which electricity is obtained to achieve the goals of long-term electricity supply. diversification implies finding alternative sources of energy such as renewable energy for the production of electricity. the south african electricity system is under increased pressure to provide and maintain electricity supply to its users. electricity production may be regarded as a key contributor to the social and economic development of south africa. the challenges are so serious that it will gradually become increasingly difficult to extract sufficient resources to satisfy increasing electricity demand. growth in the electricity and industrial sectors signifies profound changes in the entire energy industry. the south african power utility eskom, supplies 94% of south africa’s electricity but the risk of inadequate supply because of increasing electricity demand is mitigated through the employment of independent power producers (ipps) which supply to the grid. however, although a limited number of ipp entrepreneurs sell electricity to the eskom grid, there is no enabling entrepreneurial environment in which they can thrive. there is no positive movement to inaugurate policies and processes. this has created an opportunity for smart grid access as a viable option to accommodate ipp entrepreneurs into the grid. investing in renewable electricity sources may provide feasible alternatives for the electricity industry, it would alleviate pressure on current supply whilst creating an enabling entrepreneurial environment for ipp entrepreneurs and increase entrepreneurial activity. this study investigates a proposed model for an enabling entrepreneurial environment for ipps in the re sector that can be utilised to ensure increased entrepreneurial activity within the electricity industry. establishing such an enabling environment would contribute positively to the alleviation of the electricity demand crisis, result in lower carbon emissions and create a sustainable, more diverse electricity generation mix. this proposed ipp industry model for an enabling entrepreneurial environment is presented to address the problems experienced at the different levels of the electricity industry. the model can be utilised to increase entrepreneurial activity while eradicating major electricity challenges at different levels in the south african electricity industry. the results indicate that that re, in the form of solar and wind, has the potential to expand the south african electricity industry significantly. therefore, in order to reform the south african electricity industry, stakeholders need to embrace entrepreneurship as ipp entrepreneurs. this can be done effectively by the incorporation of ipp entrepreneurs into the electricity network. however, an enabling entrepreneurial environment in which to operate must be ensured. in this study, five important variables support the establishment of an enabling entrepreneurial environment for ipp entrepreneurs. these have been identified as; smart grids, entrepreneurship, renewable electricity environment, sa policy and stakeholder theory. an important contribution has been made towards stakeholder theory. this has proven to be instrumental within the re sector of the electricity industry in south africa, as the mentioned role players have a reciprocal role to play. three surveys were conducted at three levels of the electricity industry, namely, at organisational, legislative and entrepreneurial levels and included eskom management, national energy regulator (nersa) management and approved and non-approved ipps. both qualitative and quantitative research methods were utilised in this research study. the results indicate that sa policy is instrumental in assisting stakeholders to facilitate the ipp process and feed the power from re generation into the network. most respondents were positive about the role of smart grids in future electricity generation and their contribution towards creating an enabling entrepreneurial environment for ipp entrepreneurs. respondents indicated that by policy decisions, greater emphasis can be placed on the results of climate change and environmental challenges. emphasis on the incorporation of stakeholders proved imperative to this group (ipps). the results indicated that stakeholder management is a key factor contributing to the establishment of an enabling entrepreneurial environment. the major contribution of this study is a proposed entrepreneurial model that can improve future sustainability of the electricity supply",faculty of business and economic sciences,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/3528'],"[{'name': 'Palmer, Vivian Julian'}]",an enabling environment for independent power producers in renewable electricity,2015,,

the thesis studies the relevancy of masdar city for low carbon urban development in norway. this is conducted by studying the city planning and metabolism measures. original goals are compared with currently developed parts of masdar city. evidence is collected by literature reviews, observations and analyses. the gathered information is used to evaluate the city´s relevancy to norway. 

the results show that the measures made within urban form and building design in masdar city are of relevance, but that the overall concept of masdar city is of limited relevancy for low carbon urban development in norway. one of the reasons is that the development has not fulfilled its original goals. however, it is also due to the already well developed recycling policy and renewable share in norway. 

the city can nevertheless still claim to be carbon neutral due to the limitations embedded in the overall concept. carbon neutrality is currently set as a goal for norwegian development as well. it is suggested that the goal is reconsidered and changed to a goal that does not disunite responsibility. recommendation for further research is therefore to study how the current belief of carbon neutrality as a credible goal can be reconsidered in a worldwide context","university of stavanger, norway",['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1826'],"[{'name': 'Moxnes, Irmelin Aamodt'}]",the relevancy of masdar city for low carbon urban development in norway,2015,,

the present work evaluates the solvay process where carbon dioxide is passed into ammoniated brine and reacts with sodium chloride to form a precipitate of sodium bicarbonate and soluble ammonium chloride. the process has the dual benefit of decreasing sodium concentration in the reject brine and reducing carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere. process parameters were studied in a semi-batch reactor to determine their effect on co₂ capture efficiency and ions removal. these parameters included: ammonia to sodium chloride molar ratio, reaction time, temperature, gas flow rate, and pressure. since ammonium bicarbonate is another important intermediate in the formation of sodium bicarbonate, its effect on ions removal was evaluated. the optimum conditions for maximum co₂ capture efficiency and ions removal have been determined using response surface methodology (rsm). in addition, the continuous solvay process has been studied at different liquid residence times. the optimum conditions for the continuous solvay process have also been evaluated for long experimental runs. in the semi-batch mode, the highest sodium removal of 33.0 % and the best co₂ capture of 86.2 % were obtained under specific conditions. the optimum co₂ capture efficiency and ions removal was found to be at a temperature of 19.3oc, gas flow rate of 1.544 l/min, and 3.3nh3:1nacl molar ratio. in the continuous solvay process maximum ions removal were found at gas and liquid flow rates of 1.544 l/min and 12.5 ml/min, respectively, with a gas-to-liquid ratio of 123, and the reaction reached the steady-state after 240 min; the co₂ capture efficiency in 480 min was equal to 97.9% and maximum sodium removal was 32.5%. these results indicated the technical feasibility of the solvay approach for the capture of co₂ and management of desalination reject brine",scholarworks@uaeu,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/14198'],"[{'name': 'Mohammad, Ameera Fares'}]",optimization of a combined approach for the treatment of desalination reject brine and capture of co₂,2015,,

in papers i–ii, we estimate greenhouse gas emissions from food production for current diets and expected future developments, together with alternative di- etary developments and potential technical improvements in the agricultural sec- tor. costs and possibilities for reaching climate goals are analyzed for the differ- ent diets. the results indicate that a phase out of ruminant products would cut mitigation cost in half, for staying below a 2◦c limit, and it may be necessary if the climate sensitivity is high.

in this work, the prediction capabilities of these two eos were compared for several properties. the analysis began with an evaluation of their use in the prediction of the saturation properties of pure components and derivative properties from ambient conditions to the supercritical range. the particular derivative properties studied include the isochoric and isobaric heat capacities, the speed of sound, and the isothermal compressibility. in general, it was concluded that pc-saft outperforms pr in all cases. next, the same primary and derivative properties of several binary and a select ternary mixture were studied. to improve agreement with experimental data, a binary interaction parameter was introduced and fitted to binary mixture vapor – liquid equilibria (vle) data. this procedure drastically improved the accuracy of the models compared to the case where no binary interaction parameter used for the case of vle predictions. however, for the case of the derivative properties, the use of the binary interaction parameter to ensure a more accurate representation of the interactions between molecules had only a marginal effect on the prediction of these properties.

finally, phase equilibria of hydrates were studied. as eos for fluids are not designed to predict the properties of solid phases, the van der waals-platteeuw model was incorporated to allow for the prediction of three-phase equilibrium conditions of various hydrate formers. specifically, this work focused on the equilibrium of a water-rich liquid phase, a hydrate phase and a vapor phase rich in a hydrate former. in all cases, calculations of the solid hydrate phase properties are based on the kihara potential. this potential requires three parameters to be defined; initial values for which were found through a review of the literature. the accuracy of the predictions of the three-phase equilibrium is highly dependent on the reliability of these parameters. thus, one of the parameters, the so-called ε parameter, was fitted to hydrate equilibrium data and resulted in a significant improvement in the accuracy of predictions of both pc-saft and pr eos. the new set of parameters was then used to predict the three-phase equilibrium of several binary, ternary and quaternary mixtures of hydrate forming agents. several conclusions are drawn from this work, including the observation that the accuracy of the models is reduced when the number of components increases",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/182'],"[{'name': 'El Meragawi, Sally'}]",modeling of thermodynamic properties and phase equilibria of multicomponent systems related to the oil and gas industry using the pc-saft equation of state,2015,,

anthropogenic carbon dioxide (co2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. here we describe data sets and a methodology to quantify all major components of the global carbon budget, including their uncertainties, based on the combination of a range of data, algorithms, statistics, and model estimates and their interpretation by a broad scientific community. we discuss changes compared to previous estimates as well as consistency within and among components, alongside methodology and data limitations. co2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry (eff) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change (eluc), mainly deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land-cover-change data, fire activity associated with deforestation, and models. the global atmospheric co2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (gatm) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. the mean ocean co2 sink (socean) is based on observations from the 1990s, while the annual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean models. the variability in socean is evaluated with data products based on surveys of ocean co2 measurements. the global residual terrestrial co2 sink (sland) is estimated by the difference of the other terms of the global carbon budget and compared to results of independent dynamic global vegetation models forced by observed climate, co2, and land-cover change (some including nitrogen–carbon interactions). we compare the mean land and ocean fluxes and their variability to estimates from three atmospheric inverse methods for three broad latitude bands. all uncertainties are reported as ±1σ, reflecting the current capacity to characterise the annual estimates of each component of the global carbon budget. for the last decade available (2005–2014), eff was 9.0 ± 0.5 gtc yr−1, eluc was 0.9 ± 0.5 gtc yr−1, gatm was 4.4 ± 0.1 gtc yr−1, socean was 2.6 ± 0.5 gtc yr−1, and sland was 3.0 ± 0.8 gtc yr−1. for the year 2014 alone, eff grew to 9.8 ± 0.5 gtc yr−1, 0.6 % above 2013, continuing the growth trend in these emissions, albeit at a slower rate compared to the average growth of 2.2 % yr−1 that took place during 2005–2014. also, for 2014, eluc was 1.1 ± 0.5 gtc yr−1, gatm was 3.9 ± 0.2 gtc yr−1, socean was 2.9 ± 0.5 gtc yr−1, and sland was 4.1 ± 0.9 gtc yr−1. gatm was lower in 2014 compared to the past decade (2005–2014), reflecting a larger sland for that year. the global atmospheric co2 concentration reached 397.15 ± 0.10 ppm averaged over 2014. for 2015, preliminary data indicate that the growth in eff will be near or slightly below zero, with a projection of −0.6 [range of −1.6 to +0.5] %, based on national emissions projections for china and the usa, and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the global economy for the rest of the world. from this projection of eff and assumed constant eluc for 2015, cumulative emissions of co2 will reach about 555 ± 55 gtc (2035 ± 205 gtco2) for 1870–2015, about 75 % from eff and 25 % from eluc. this living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new carbon budget compared with previous publications of this data set (le quéré et al., 2015, 2014, 2013). all observations presented here can be downloaded from the carbon

the underlying principles for mathematically describing the multi-physics of multiphase multicomponent behaviour in porous media are reviewed with particular interest on their application to modelling gcs. a fully coupled non-isothermal multiphase biot-type double-porosity formulation is derived, where emphasis during derivation is on capturing the coupled hydro-thermomechanical (htm) processes for the purposes of study.

the formulated system of governing field equations is discretised in space by considering the standard galerkin finite element procedure and its spatial refinement in the context of capturing coupled htm processes within a gcs system. this presents a coupled set of nonlinear first-order ordinary differential equations in time. the system is discretised temporally and solved using an embedded finite difference method which is schemed with control theoretical techniques and an accelerated fixed-point-type procedure.

the developed numerical model is employed to solve a sequence of benchmark problems of increasing complexity in order to comprehensively study and highlight important coupled processes within potential gcs systems. this includes fracture/matrix fluid displacement, formation deformation and joule-thomson cooling effects. the computational framework is also extended to allow for the simulation of cosmic-ray muon radiography (muography) in order to assess the extent to which detected changes in subsurface muon flux due to co2 storage can be used to monitor gcs. this study demonstrates promise for muography as a novel passive-continuous monitoring aid for gcs",university of sheffield conference proceedings,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/139'],"[{'name': 'Lincoln, Darren L'}]","theoretical and numerical aspects of modelling

one of several barriers in the well to prevent kicks and blowouts and it is the
most important and critical equipment, as it becomes the last line of protection
against blowout. the bop system used in subsea drilling operations is
considered a safety – critical system, with a high severity consequence
following its failure. following past offshore blowout incidents such as the most
recent macondo in the gulf of mexico, there have been investigations, research,
and improvements sought for improved understanding of the bop system and
its operation. this informs the need for a systematic re-evaluation of the subsea
bop system to understand its associated risk and reliability and identify critical
areas/aspects/components.
different risk analysis techniques were surveyed and the failure modes effect
and criticality analysis (fmeca) selected to be used to drive the study in this
thesis. this is due to it being a simple proven cost effective process that can
add value to the understanding of the behaviours and properties of a system,
component, software, function or other. the output of the fmeca can be used
to inform or support other key engineering tasks such as redesigning, enhanced
qualification and testing activity or maintenance for greater inherent reliability
and reduced risk potential. this thesis underscores the application of the
fmeca technique to critique associated risk of the subsea bop system.
system functional diagrams was developed with boundaries defined, a fmeca
were carried out and an initial select list of critical component failure modes
identified. the limitations surrounding the confidence of the fmeca failure
modes ranking outcome based on risk priority number (rpn) is presented and
potential variations in risk interpretation are discussed.
the main contribution in this thesis is an innovative framework utilising
multicriteria decision making (mcda) analysis techniques with consideration of
fuzzy interval data is applied to the subsea bop system critical failure modes
from the fmeca analysis. it utilised nine criticality assessment criteria deduced
from expert consultation to obtain a more reliable ranking of failure modes. the mcda techniques applied includes the technique for order of preference for
similarity to the ideal solution (topsis), fuzzy topsis, topsis with interval
data, and preference ranking organization method for enrichment of
evaluations (promethee). the outcome of the multi-criteria analysis of the
bop system clearly shows failures of the wellhead connector, lmrp hydraulic
connector and control system related failure as the top 3 most critical failure
with respect to a well control. the critical failure mode and components
outcome from the analysis in this thesis is validated using failure data from
industry database and a sensitivity analysis carried out. the importance of
maintenance, testing and redundancy to the bop system criticality was
established by the sensitivity analysis. the potential for mcda to be used for
more specific analysis of criteria for a technology was demonstrated.
improper maintenance, inspection, testing (functional and pressure) are critical
to the bop system performance and sustenance of a high reliability level.
material selection and performance of components (seals, flanges, packers,
bolts, mechanical body housings) relative to use environment and operational
conditions is fundamental to avoiding failure mechanisms occurrence. also
worthy of notice is the contribution of personnel and organisations (by way of
procedures to robustness and verification structure to ensure standard expected
practices/rules are followed) to failures as seen in the root cause discussion.
oems, operators and drilling contractors to periodically review operation
scenarios relative to bop system product design through the use of a failure
reporting analysis and corrective action system. this can improve design of
monitoring systems, informs requirement for re-qualification of technology

carbon capture and storage (ccs) technology is predicted to be the most important low cost technology for co2 capture. by applying capture technology on plants utilising biomass, negative co2 emissions are achievable, which will thus deprive the atmosphere of co2, and klemetsrud waste incineration plant is one such plant. though transport and storage of the recovered co2 are equally important in ccs projects, capture technology has been the main area of focus in this work.

this report presents the available ccs technologies and makes a recommendation as to which co2 capture technology is best suited for klemetsrud. klemetsrud represents a flue gas point source with a co2 concentration of 11,5 vol% at atmospheric pressure. due to these limiting factors, as well as being a retrofit project, post-­‐combustion capture using amines was evaluated to be the best suited technology. different amines and relating processes were evaluated based on the energy penalty they will impose on the incineration plant and the maturity of the technology. in general, amine based technologies are associated with large energy penalties, but through extensive and proper integration and choosing the right process, an acceptable efficiency is achievable.

amines have been utilised in the process of removing co2 for decades, and is therefore regarded as a mature technology. mea is the most common amine, but less energy intensive processes using hindered amines are also commercialised. the world s first commercially scaled power plant is utilising the cansolv process, which uses a proprietary hindered amine.

basted on a literature study, energy saving capture processes and changes to the incineration and capture plant were suggested to achieve a higher efficiency. the most promising retrofit of the incineration plant is implementing oxygen enriched combustion. this technology is not mature and was therefore not recommended for ege at this point, but in combination with post-­‐combustion capture it is emphasised that this technology has great potential.

transport on a large scale is usually carried out by ship or pipelines. there is no such network in norway, and transport is therefore predicted to be carried out by rail or road tankers, and is therefor not disused in detail. utilisation and permanent storage of the recovered co2 is discussed based on the emission reduction effect. an attractive way of utilising co2 while at the same time ensuring permanent storage in norway is through enhanced oil recovery (eor). co2 specifications have been listed for the main areas of co2 application",ntnu,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1826'],"[{'name': 'Helsing, Gina Plahte'}]",options for carbon capture with storage or reuse in waste incineration processes,2015,,

this work is an investigation of a two-step, temperature-staged dcl process and aimed at producing a high value liquid hydrocarbon product at, relatively, mild operating conditions.
this stepwise process was initially carried out in a batch reactor. in this first stage, the aim was to maximise on the liquid product (oil) yield by enhancing the thermal dissolution of high grade bituminous type coal in tetralin as the hydrogen donor solvent, using 2:1 and 3:1 solvent: coal ratios. the oil obtained was refined by hydrotreating in a catalytic fixed bed reactor. both stages were carried out isobarically at 100 barg and, in the first stage, temperatures of 250 ℃ and 300 °c were used. thereafter, operating temperatures were staged with a 50 °c increase in the second stage reactor. in the first stage, molybdenum doped magnetite was used as the catalyst. the performances of cobalt-molybdenum (co-mo) and nickel-molybdenum (ni-mo) were trialled in the second-stage reactor. in order to assess the potential value of the oil between the stages, the oil was analysed using gas chromatography –mass spectrometry (gc-ms).
within the actual experimental boundary; oil yield, alkane and cycloalkane selectivity response data was fitted to linear models. in the first stage the liquid yield was increased with the use of molybdenum doped magnetite catalyst and affected mainly by the temperature and solvent: coal ratios. an oil yield of approximately 51.26% was obtained for blank runs and up to 54.77% for catalysed runs. as a hydrodesulphurisation (hds) performer and selectivity to the production of long and branched chain alkanes, ni-mo had an improved performance over co-mo. co-mo is selective to a higher concentration of cycloalkanes. for 16 days on stream each, ni-mo had a higher activity than co-mo.
a comparison of the actual data with a literature baseline, showed similarities for the results obtained using 2:1 solvent: coal ratios for both the blank and catalysed runs. as literature made use of severe operating conditions, the performance of the experimental batch reactor system was superior to literature.
while there remains room for improvement in the design of the two-stage system, evidence exists that the potential to cover the demand for low–sulphur, crude diesel and solvents from the production of high value hydrocarbon liquid in the said process, is demonstrated",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2118'],"[{'name': 'Singh, Reyna.'}]","an investigation of a two-step, temperature-staged, direct coal liquefaction process.",2015,,

opportunities to address project life cycle energy are typically identified through a life cycle assessment (lca). however at present there is little validated data, no coherent method for data capture and limited incentive for project stakeholders to address initial embodied energy consumption. in response, this research project presents a contractor s practical approach towards assessing initial embodied energy consumption within uk non-domestic construction projects. an action research methodological approach enabled the assessment and potential reduction of initial embodied energy to be explored within a large principal contractor through five research cycles which included diagnosing and action planning, action taking, evaluating and specified learning.

a comprehensive framework is designed to highlight the significance of initial embodied energy consumption relative to specific construction packages, activities and sub-contractors. this framework is then explored within three uk non-domestic construction projects (i.e. two industrial warehouses and one commercial office). capturing information from live projects enables practical challenges and opportunities inherent when addressing initial embodied energy consumption to be identified. a series of contractor current practices are reviewed, and subsequently improved, to enhance their compliance with the framework requirements.

the findings emphasise the importance of material phase impacts, especially construction packages which primarily contain steel and concrete-based materials (i.e. ground and upper floor, external slab and frame). the importance of project type, site area, building lifespan and waste consumption are also recognised to reduce initial embodied energy consumption. the framework provides a practical approach for initial embodied energy assessment which can readily be adopted to help highlight further opportunities to reduce energy consumption. the research project concludes by presenting a number of recommendations for consideration by the construction industry and associated stakeholders, along with requirements for future research",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/66'],[{'name': 'Philip J.

in the first part of study, li ion diffusion in electrolyte and its effect of kinetics was investigated. the mesoporous tio2 was chosen because mesoporous structure is known to have facile li ion diffusion through electrolyte, and because other parameters related to volume expansion along the reaction can be eliminated with tio2 system, facilitating investigation of  li ion diffusion. 3-dimmensional mesoporous tio2 particles with three different pore sizes and two different particle sizes were synthesized using nano-silica as a template. moreover, the structure of synthesized materials was analyzed with transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, small angle x-ray diffraction, and nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherm. using the synthesized materials, electrochemical experiments were conducted. there was no difference in electrochemical performances between the synthesized materials with 1 m concentration electrolyte. on the other hand, li ion depletion occurs inside of the active materials depending on the size of the active materials and the pore sizes with 0.1 m concentration electrolyte. such result reflects that the particle size and pore size are influencial parameter that affects li ion diffusion, but their effects are negligible in 1 m concentration electrolyte. based on the acquired results, the mathematical model with thiele modulus was set up, and the boundaries of li ion depletion inside of the particle was predicted using the model.
in the second part of this study, the reaction mechanism and the kinetics of si, which has high theoretical capacity, were investigated. the reaction between si and li was widely reported to progress through solid-solution reaction. recently, however, there were some reports that insist that the reaction of li-si is two-phase reaction, and the reaction mechanism of li-si requires some clarification. the main obstacle for analyzing the reaction mechanism of li-si is due to the amorphous structure which silicon transforms into during the reaction. thus, routinely used analytic methods have limitations to be used in li-si system. in this study, the reaction between li and si was analyzed with electrochemical method and thermodynamic relations, which is independent of the structure of material. the result concludes that the reaction between li and si proceeds through two steps of two-phase reaction. this result was confirmed by showing the trend of the diffusion coefficient change of li in si is similar to that of the materials with two-phase reaction. also, it is logically more plausible to understand the reaction between li and si with two-phase reaction. the electrochemical performances for si were measured with various current densities, and it was discovered that two different two-phase reactions had different kinetic properties. the cause was investigated using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. two resistances related to charge transfer and solid-electrolyte interphase were extracted from the impedance data, and it was found that these two resistances are not dominant parameters that determine the kinetics of two reactions. based on these evidences, among the three kinetic parameters, diffusion in electrolyte, surface reaction, and bulk diffusion, this study concluded that the rate determining step is the diffusion in bulk phase. furthermore, the strategy to use si more effectively was proposed, and confirmed with experiments.
through this study, the reaction mechanism of active material and the important kinetic parameters were clarified. these findings give some clues to effectively designing active materials depending on the environment of the reactions.abstract	i

this research critically investigates the scope of the implementation of emss in this ic, which necessarily entails assessing the efforts of the presidency of meteorology and environment (pme), which is the government agency responsible for environmental protection. this research also details the barriers and possible environmental benefits to be derived from ems implementation. these objectives are achieved through a multi-method case study research design, involving questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and document analysis. 183 organizations (32% of all organizations in the ic) participated in the questionnaires, and two sets of interviews were conducted: 14 with environmental managers in the ic, and 12 with officials from various relevant government agencies.

the results show that the basic requirements of ems are inadequately implemented, and that awareness of environmental legislation (and compliance with it) is extremely limited. the most important barriers facing the implementation of emss in this ic include lack of enforcement of existing legislation and low levels of environmental awareness. the cost of implementing emss is a further important obstacle, particularly for small- and medium-sized organizations (smes). nevertheless, although the main motivations reported were economic, adopting an ems in full can result in measurably improved environmental performance, through reducing natural resource consumption (chiefly energy and water). those with an informal or partial ems also experience environmental benefits relative to those who have no form of ems. improvements to operational safety are another benefit to be derived from implementing emss. it also argues that the widespread adoption of ems could greatly assist the government in its drive toward sustainable development and improved management of natural resources.

accordingly, recommendations are provided to enhance the implementation of ems in the ic as well as to overcome the aforementioned obstacles in order to effect changes towards achieving sustainable development.

this doctoral thesis presents the studies of preparation, characterisation and immobilisation of amines on carbon aerogels for subsequent application in adsorption/desorption of co2 at different temperatures.
initially, we describe the production of organic and carbon aerogels, in the metal free form (dhbaf/h, dhbarf/h and rf/h), and metal doped (dhbaf/fe, dhbaf/ni, dhbarf/fe, dhbarf/ni, rf/fe and rf/ni) with different percentages of solids. in addition, it was also possible to synthesise a new type of more robust aerogel by the introduction of isocyanate (homopolymer of 1, 6-hexamethylene diisocyanate). this resulted in a synthetic macroporous carbon aerogel, rif. the structural properties of the organic and carbon aerogels were determined by nitrogen adsorption at 77k and subsequent treatment by the bet, dr, s, bjh and dft methods. a selection of metal free carbon aerogels (dhbaf/h4, rf/h4 and rif) were functionalised with different type of amines: primary amine (dmpa), primary and secondary amines (peha, tepa, tpta, teta and deta), primary, secondary and tertiary amine (pei) and tertiary amine (dabco). functionalisation and an increase in the temperature of analysis of the carbon aerogels showed a decrease of the maximum co2 adsorption capacity. a kinetic evaluation of co2 adsorption by samples of functionalised and non-functionalised carbon aerogels was determined based on the lagergren pseudo-first order kinetic model. the activation energy was calculated from the arrhenius equation. the kinetic evaluation showed that the diffusion process of co2 molecules in carbon aerogels cannot be interpreted exclusively on pore volume, as the micropore width also seems to have a strong influence on the diffusion kinetics in these materials. in view of the results obtained, the process of immobilisation of amines in carbon aerogels type dhbaf/h4 and with pei amine resulted in samples with a more promising kinetic behaviour",universidade de evora,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1949'],"[{'name': 'Marques, Luísa Maria Leal da Silva'}]",aerogéis de carbono com área superficial muito elevada e funcionalidade superficial amínica para captura de dióxido de carbono,2015,,

natural gas transport is done under high pressure and these fluids are also saturated with water. these conditions are favourable to hydrates formation, leading to pipelines blockage. to avoid these operational problems, thermodynamic inhibitors, like methanol or ethanol, are injected in lines.
it is necessary to predict with more accuracy hydrates boundaries in different systems to avoid their formation in pipelines for example, as well as vapour liquid equilibria (vle) in both sub-critical regions. phase equilibria predictions are usually based on cubic equations of state and applied to mixtures, mixing rules involving the binary interaction parameter are required. a predictive model based on the group contribution method, called ppr78, combined with the cubic – plus – association (cpa) equation of state has been developed in order to predict phase equilibria of mixtures containing associating compounds, such as water and alcohols.

the aim is to investigate the effect of certain psychological and social influences on the adoption of technology necessary to enable smart grids, in order to understand the implications for effective energy policy. in particular, the case of photovoltaic (pv) system adoption in the uk is studied. 

empirical data detailing pv installations registered for the feed in tariff is analysed in order to understand rates of adoption and how they vary across both time and space. this analysis is combined with a review of policy intervention and literature from psychology to understand drivers for adoption among householders. the results from this study are then used to inform the design of an agent based model of technology adoption within the smart grid context. the decision making of householders is modelled using an algorithm based on social 
cognitive theory. the model is used to simulate different conditions and generate adoption scenarios in order to understand the potential effects of different parameters on adoption rates. 

in order to combine the analysis resulting from these methods, the multi-level perspective on transition in socio-technical systems is used to understand how a transition to a smart grid could be described and how adoption of pv in the uk under the feed in tariff incentive fits into such a transition. 

the results show that whilst economic incentive policies have had success in some areas adoption is also dependent on many non-financial parameters. simulations show that the observability of adoption and the perceived inconvenience or urgency of adoption can have dramatic effects on rates of adoption, in some cases outweighing the rational economic effects of financial incentives. 

the implication for smart grid related policy is that non-financial factors should be taken into account as well as the more typical financial considerations in efforts to encourage adoption of necessary enabling technology by householders. the models developed could be used in further work to examine in detail adoption of other technologies such as smart home energy management systems and the interaction between adoption rates of multiple smart technologies.the initial 3 years of the phd were funded by a bursary from the engineering and physical sciences research council (epsrc) under grant number ep/go59969/1",institute of energy and sustainable development,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/25'],"[{'name': 'Snape, J.

requires the use of optimization models to deal with problems in the scope of electricity planning. the continuous
growth of renewable energy sources (res) to generate electricity became sustainable over the last years. this growth
is justified by the increasing concerns related to the security of supply, the reduction of external energy dependency
of most european countries, including portugal, and the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. despite of the
res benefits, their integration is characterized by the difficulties on forecasting and variable electricity output. these
difficulties bring considerable challenges to the electricity system management and to its planning.
this work is focused on the assessment of the res impacts on the electricity system and on its integration in the
long and short-term electricity planning. the main goals of this work are to analyse in which way the growth of res
can affect the electricity system and its power plants, and also to propose new optimization models for the strategic
planning of the electricity system, which are able to recognize and include res impacts. this will provide the decision
maker with tools that will support the design of long-term scenarios for the electricity sector.
according to the outlined goals, four different optimization models were developed. all models were tested for a
mixed hydro-thermal-wind power system, with characteristics close to the portuguese one. the first one was proposed
for the long-term strategic electricity power planning and a 10 years planning period was considered. its usefulness
was demonstrated by applying it for the analysis of the wind power integration in the electricity system. the second
one, with a short-term horizon, aimed to solve the problem of the commissioning of power plants based on the available
resources. the implementation of this model showed that modelling the electricity power systems requires a large
set of constraints and a large number of data and information, resulting in significant computational effort to obtain a
optimal solution. the development of a third model, a simplified approach of the short-term model, became therefore
necessary. as previously, both short-term model and its simplified approach were used for the analysis of the impacts of wind power in the electricity system and in the operation of the different power plants. the last model resulted
from the combination of the strategic electricity power planning model with the simplified model proposed for the
commissioning of the power plants. the goal of this fourth model is to allow the inclusion of res impacts in the design
of scenarios for the electricity system, for a 10 years planning period.
the models application demonstrated the need to acknowledge and include the impacts of res integration,
particularly wind power, on the strategic electricity expansion planning. throughout the work, the complexity of models
was evidenced along with the difficulties that non-experienced users may face when applying them. a user-friendly
platform enabling researchers and stakeholders to deal with electricity planning problems in a simpler but reliable way
was then proposed, resulting in an important contribution for the effective dissemination and usage of these models.a tomada de decisão no sector da energia, e em particular no sector da eletricidade, é uma atividade complexa, sendo

nos últimos anos, sendo este crescimento justificado pelas preocupações relativas à segurança do abastecimento,
passando por estratégias de diversificação de tecnologias e fornecedores, pela necessidade de redução da
dependência energética externa de diversos paises europeus, onde se inclui o caso português, e pelos objetivos de
redução dos gases com efeito de estufa. apesar dos seus benefícios, a integração das energias renováveis está frequentemente
associada à dificuldade de previsão da produção de eletricidade e à produção variável, trazendo assim
desafios consideráveis à gestão do sistema elétrico e ao seu planeamento.
este trabalho centra-se na avaliação dos impactos das energias renováveis nos sistemas elétricos e na sua
inclusão no planeamento elétrico de curto e longo prazo. tem assim como objetivos principais analisar de que

bem como propor novos modelos de otimização para planeamento estratégico para o setor elétrico que permitam
reconhecer e incluir estes impactos, dotando assim o decisor de ferramentas que o possam apoiar da definição de

de acordo com os objetivos traçados, são apresentados quatro diferentes modelos de otimização. todos estes
modelos foram testados para um sistema elétrico com caracteristicas próximas do caso português, detacando-se as
componentes hídrica, térmica e eólica. o primeiro modelo visa o planeamento estratégico a longo prazo resultando na
apresentação e caracterização de cenários para o setor elétrico para um período de 10 anos, tendo sido demonstrada
a sua aplicação para a análise da integração da energia eólica no sistema. o segundo modelo utiliza um horizonte
temporal de curto prazo, tendo como objetivo apoiar a resolução do problema de comissionamento das unidades de geração eléctrica com base nos recursos disponíveis. a sua implementação demonstrou que a modelação dos
sistemas de geração de energia eléctrica pressupõe um conjunto de restrições e um elevado número de dados e
informações que resultam num esforço computacional significativo. desta forma, surgiu a necessidade de desenvolver
um terceiro modelo que consiste numa versão simplificada deste modelo de curto-prazo. ambos os modelos de curto

eléctrica, tendo como objetivo ter em consideração os impactos das energias renováveis na definição de cenários

to investigate the relationship of power plant mix and required energy storage capacity, a computer model based on global weather data has been developed to enable the simulation of electricity supply scenarios by up to ten different power plant types for various regions.



the focus of the investigation has been on the energy storage requirements of an electricity supply for europe by wind and solar power. the minimum required energy storage capacity for a totally weather dependent electricity supply occurs at a ratio of 30% wind and 70% photovoltaic (pv) power plant capacity installed. thus, the required energy storage capacity rises from a transition of to-day's electricity supply to the afore-mentioned 100% renewable wind and pv scenario exponentially to about 150 twh (3.8% of the annual electricity demand).

the installation of additional excess wind and pv power plant capacity was seen to be an efficient way to reduce the required energy storage. already 10% excess capacity lead to a reduction by 50% of the required storage capacity.

to use different storage technologies in an optimised way in terms of storage capacity and efficiency, the storage tasks can be separated into a daily and a seasonal usage. while the seasonal storage capacity has to be about two orders of magnitude larger than the required capacity of the storage for the daily cycle, the sum of stored energy during one year is almost equal for the long and short time storage.



in summary, an electricity supply by wind and pv power was shown to be completely feasible regarding the required energy storage capacity together with the required land area for power plants, and with electricity generating costs of 0.09 eur to 0.18 eur per kwh depending on the power plant mix, excess capacity, and storage investment costs",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/725'],"[{'name': 'Tröndle, Tobias Wolfgang'}]",development of a global electricity supply model and investigation of electricity supply by renewable energies with a focus on energy storage requirements for europe,2015,,

certification is required in order to safeguard markets, mainly users, buyers and consumers during purchase of products and services, and of performances.
more and more interesting is the growth potential of certification services in the field of energy,  where, owing to the well-known developments following kyoto protocol, the production market and services appear to be widely expanding, following the liberalization of energy market,  a growing diffusion of the renewable power sources, the development of ic technologies, the aim at energy savings and efficiency, the worldwide strategic target of environmental sustainability.
this study deals with the problem of certification applied to the institutions, energy processes and products, starting from the cultural and applicative platform of certifications already existing, consolidated and  approved  both  at institutional and market levels, such as those referred to products (ce, imq, etc) and to organizational standard (iso) as well as to the security and interoperability in the field of railway transportation (tsi). 
the study aims to investigate the possibility to extend at the system and to systematize the different certification activities that could be already considered as 'emerging'  within the evolution of processes and products following the development in the electric power field.
with  reference  to  future applications of smart engineering  to the various  sectors of production and use of the energy product-service, the present work  aims  to  verify the practical feasibility  of a ""voluntary product certification program"", proposed at system level, for the energy sector. the approach consists of  defining  a template for a generalized certification procedure to be used in a flexible way  in function of the large variety of types of product and in an evolutionary way, depending on the technological development and on the benchmarks derived from a deregulated energy market. its flexibility involves many and various parameters such as complexity of the configuration, in terms of number of elements and types of distributed energy resources (ders) and renewable energy sources (ress).
to develop the certification  model,  for an operative management of all aspects connected to  the complexity of the energy product, reference was made to some analogies with the railway certification, referring specifically to the technical  specifications for interoperability standards.
state and trends of certification's market models was firstly systematized,  starting from the definition and classification of the different types and sectors of application. among the latter, the field of energy was mainly investigated. later, the evolutions of energy market and pertaining technologies were considered, in order to define a targeted certification and qualification of techniques and products. 
the approach used in this study is strongly influenced by the identification of the criticalities introduced by technological innovations, services and mechanisms of commercial transactions, introduced into energy market  and upon which is based the need to guarantee the measurements and estimates of consumptions, data and operating results about technological systems,  production potentials, power efficiency,  reliability, forecast and uncertainty parameters, environmental impacts, costs and economic evaluations.
according to the growth trend of  the sector, an innovative certification of energy product was proposed, flexible if compared to the peculiar targets of the product qualification, in accordance with the type, complexity and innovation of the planning methods and technologies considered.  this study was aimed to the identification and implementation of a certification scheme related to the market of energy services, which could emerge from the re-organization and development on the physical, managerial, infrastructural and environmental context of future cities.  smart cities are characterized by new urban concepts deriving from a constant  growth of residential areas, and respective energy requirement, from the evolution of energy services models, following the application of  paradigms as smart grids and micro grids, as well as from the development of electrical power systems integrated with ict. among the different fields of application of future certification models linked to the energy sector,  special reference was made to the field of electrified public local transport.  in this context, let us mention three areas of interest  of the parallel development of drivers such as: city, energy market, and smart technologies. 
in this context,  the field of local public transportation, based on eco-sustainable electrified techniques, may potentially represent a segment for future requests of an energy certification. in this view, urban and regional public transport appears to be particularly significant since, at present, their organizational and technological structure is less programmed than railway long-distance transportation (such as high speed railway transport). for this reason it was considered relevant for this study, since it open to a new  proposals of standards and  regulations, for the current development in markets of energy and certification.
case study has been set up with reference to eco-sustainable electrified mass transit systems  which represent a basic resource for supporting the sustainable development of future cities, in a scenario of innovation based  mainly on rationalization processes of planning and design - at a systemic level – of all types of energy resources. 
focusing on innovation related to the implementation of smart grid concepts into the urban context, the case study proposes a systemization of principles for an energy efficiency management based on a new approach of global energy efficiency (gee). this new paradigm enhances the traditional definition and application of energy efficiency (ee) by simply connecting the applicative platform of smart methodologies and technologies to the potential wider energy efficiency objectives of users' area, at the system level, pursued by optimizing the use of all their available primary and infrastructural energy resources, and maximizing the economic benefits of both energy providers and consumers. the gee approach is ""customized"" to the metropolitan assets for mass transport services within the urban context. the interest of dealing with such a type of infrastructure derives from several factors, such as centrality, extension, dispersion, electrical powering and consumptions, structuring and organization of service. given the intrinsic systemic approach, the model provides strong and flexible capability of supporting the ee management in planning and decision-making problems with smart and dynamic transactions, addressing participation in the future electricity market. therefore, it is very suitable for gee in a smart city environment.
moreover, on the basis of the developed optimal power flow model, a complete management of power flow and energy dispatching can be scheduled and implemented,  according to the ordinary operation of the components of a smart user grid, accepting their possible variations over the time related to compatible technical procedures. in particular, a variety of tasks can be considered, such as demand response program (drp) management, load leveling and shifting, ancillary services supporting distribution system operator's ordinary operation, electricity market transactions, or at fulfilling emergency requirements. 
the choice of the case study was made with a twofold view: firstly the case study can be clearly included in the class of most complex and advanced future energy systems or areas, consisting of a very heterogeneous and largely distributed energy area centered on a urban mass transit system; secondly also the model of intelligent energy management tool for its operation was featured and developed to highlight the feasibility and significance of the proposed new scheme of energy product certificate.
this thesis reports some demonstrative cases to give evidence to the smart proprieties of the model and the potentiality of the energy smart system, that was chosen as an ideal pattern of complex and flexible energy area, particularly suitable to be an objective of the proposed certification scheme. in the demonstrative applications the operator's operational strategy aims to gain maximum profit by best coordinating of the available energy resources, within the limits deriving from the activities both of the sug, representing the users, and the dso, representing the distribution network (dn).in the last part of the thesis, an exemplification of the new procedure for voluntary product certification program (vpcp) was performed, considering the energy area represented  by the referential case study.
this thesis consists of  8 chapters, as follows.
in the first chapter, an overview of certification and accreditation is presented. then, the state of the art of the certification is explained in the second ones, giving particular attention to the energy sector, on which the present work is centered. the third and fourth chapters consist in a dissertation of the recent evolution of power systems physical structure and technologies, as well as on the certification services needs within the energy market. the proposal of a new energy voluntary product certification program is presented in the chapter 5. the case study and pertaining applications is explained in the chapter 6 and 7, they are related to a metro- funicular transportation system and its neighborhood. finally, in chapter 8 the  model proposed in chapter 5 is implemented in the energy area defined in the case study",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/421'],"[{'name': 'Di Florio, Giuliana'}]","innovative model of product certification within the energy deregulated market.

with these considerations in mind, we developed multiple series of heteroatom doped porous carbons by using nitrogen containing carbon precursors. benzimidazole-linked polymers (bilp-5), benzimidazole monomer (bi) and azo-linked polymers (alp-6) were successfully transformed into heteroatom-doped carbons through chemical activation by potassium hydroxide. alternative activation by zinc chloride and direct heating was also applied to alp-6. the controlled activation/carbonization process afforded diverse textural properties, adjustable heteroatom doping levels and remarkable gas sorption properties. nitrogen isotherms at 77 k revealed that micropores dominate the porous structure of carbons. the highest brunauer-emett-teller (bet) surface area (4171 m2 g-1) and pore volume (2.3 cm3 g-1) were obtained for carbon synthesized by koh activation of bi at 700 °c. in light of the synergistic effect of basic heteroatoms and fine micropores, all carbons exhibit remarkable gas capture and selectivity. particularly, bi and bipl-5 derived carbons feature unprecedented co2 uptakes of 6.2 mmol g-1 (1 bar) and 2.1 mmol g-1 (0.15 bar) at 298 k, respectively. the alp-6 derived carbons retained considerable amount of nitrogen dopants (up to 14.4 wt%) after heat treatment owing to the presence of more stable nitrogen-nitrogen bonds compared to nitrogen-carbon bonds in bilp-5 and bi precursors. subsequently, the highest selectivity of 62 for co2/n2 and 11 for co2/ch4 were obtained at 298 k for a carbon prepared by koh activation of alp-6 at 500 °c",vcu scholars compass,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2330'],"[{'name': 'Ashourirad, Babak'}]","heteroatom-doped nanoporous carbons: synthesis, characterization and application to gas storage and separation",2015,,

(3) how about the wto dispute settlement panel report about this problem? the finding is that the dominant default policy, the ip protection standard, is the only minimum requirement in the case of uncertainty in legal provisions and practices. therefore, the negative effects on the transfer of climate-friendly technology increase in terms of using flexible provision to promote import technologies. third, this paper introduces china’s current patent law and its practice in response to climate-friendly technology transfer. lastly, this paper provides suggestions with regard to the need for comprehensive and explicit protection standards in the context of climate-friendly technology transfer",centro de ensino unificado de brasilia,"['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/13842', 'https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/4786']","[{'name': 'Jiani, Jiang'}, {'name': 'Zhang, Guihong'}, {'name': 'Wang, Can'}]",international standards for intellectual property rights protection: a reflection on climate-friendly technology transfer,2015,Revista de Direito Internacional,['2237-1036']

in this study, supercritical water gasification was used for (i) the hydrothermal processing of macroalgae for the production of gaseous fuel – mainly hydrogen and methane – and (ii) the upgrading of the process water from hydrothermal liquefaction of microalgae for hydrogen production for biocrude hydrotreating.

the supercritical water gasification (scwg) of the four macroalgae species investigated (saccharina latissima, laminaria digitata, laminaria hyperborea, and alaria esculenta) produced a gas that mainly consisted of hydrogen, methane and carbon dioxide. non-catalytic scwg resulted in hydrogen yields of 3.3-4.2 mol/kg macroalgae and methane yields of 1.6-3.3 mol/kg macroalgae. catalytic scwg (using ruthenium) resulted in hydrogen yields of 7.8-10.2 mol/kg macroalgae and methane yields of 4.7-6.4 mol/kg macroalgae.

the yield of hydrogen was approximately three times higher when using sodium hydroxide as catalyst (16.3 mol h2 / kg macroalgae) compared to non-catalysed scwg of l. hyperborea (5.18 mol h2 / kg macroalgae). the energy recovery (an expression of how much chemical energy of the feedstock is recovered in the desired product following hydrothermal processing) was 83% when sodium hydroxide was used as a catalyst, compared to 52% for the non-catalytic scwg of l. hyperborea. 

the yield of methane was approximately 2.5 times higher (9.0 mol ch4 kg 1macroalgae) when using ruthenium catalyst compared to the non-catalysed experiment (3.36 mol ch4 / kg macroalgae) and the energy recovery increased by 22% to 74%.

the selectivity of methane or hydrogen production during the scwg of macroalgae can be controlled using ruthenium or sodium hydroxide respectively. longer hold times and increased reaction temperature favoured methane production when using ruthenium. an increase in catalyst loading had no significant effect on the methane yield. higher hydrogen yields were obtained through using higher concentrations of sodium hydroxide, lower algal feed concentration and shorter hold times (30 min). increasing reaction times (>30 min) with a base catalyst (sodium hydroxide) decreased the hydrogen yield. overall energy recovery was highest at the lowest feed concentrations; 90.5% using ruthenium and 111% using sodium hydroxide.

the process waters from the hydrothermal liquefaction (htl) of microalgae (chlorella, pseudochoricystis, and spirulina) were gasified under supercritical water conditions to maximise hydrogen production. hydrogen yields ranged from 0.18-0.29 g h2 / g biocrude from scwg of the process water of htl along with near complete gasification of the organics (~98%). compared to the hydrogen requirements for hydrotreating algal biocrude (~0.05 g h2 / g biocrude), excess hydrogen can be produced from upgrading the process water through scwg. the results indicate that process waters following scwg are still rich in nutrients that can be recycled for algal cultivation",university of leeds,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/139'],"[{'name': 'Cherad, Ramzi'}]",supercritical water gasification of algae,2015,,

since the industrial revolution at an accelerating rate causing environmental
impact such as global warming and climate change. projections indicate that co2
concentrations will continue to rise to unsustainable levels. this highlights the
scale of the challenge our scientists are facing in order to reduce co2 emissions
and underpins the importance of promoting green process engineering for the
utilisation of co2 as a valuable commodity in the process industry. the
transformation of co2 to value-added chemicals such as organic carbonates
provides a promising technological advancement aimed at reducing co2
atmospheric concentrations to sustainable levels.
dimethyl carbonate (dmc) is a promising green compound that exhibits versatile
and excellent chemical properties and therefore finds applications as an
intermediate in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. dmc has a high
oxygen content and can be used as an oxygenate additive to gasoline to improve
its performance and reduce exhaust emission. the conventional method for dmc
synthesis involves the utilisation of phosgene as a toxic feedstock. thus, greener
and more sustainable synthetic processes for the synthesis of dmc are required.
recently, non-toxic synthetic routes have been explored; these include, oxidative
carbonylation of carbon monoxide (co), oxygen (o2) and meoh, direct synthesis
from meoh and co2 and the transesterification of cyclic carbonates and
methanol (meoh). the oxidative carbonylation route suffers from the use of
expensive raw materials and corrosive reagents as well as being hazardous due
to the explosive potential of co. the direct production of dmc from meoh and
co2 offers an attractive and green synthetic route for dmc synthesis. also, the
synthesis of dmc via the transesterification of cyclic carbonates and meoh,
where cyclic carbonates can be synthesised from their corresponding epoxides
and co2, makes the synthesis of dmc via transesterification route more
environmentally friendly and desirable in terms of green chemistry and
sustainable development. therefore, in this research new greener catalytic
processes for dmc synthesis via addition of meoh to co2 route and
transesterification route have been explored. 
in this work, several commercially available heterogeneous catalysts such as
ceria and lanthana doped zirconia (ce–la–zr–o), ceria doped zirconia (ce–zr–
o), lanthana doped zirconia (la–zr–o), lanthanum oxide (la–o) and zirconium
oxide (zr–o) have been extensively assessed for the synthesis of dmc. strongly
coupled graphene based inorganic nanocomposites represent an exciting and
new class of functional materials and therefore the utilisation of graphene oxide
(go) as a suitable support for metal oxide catalysts has been explored. ceria
doped zirconia graphene nanocomposites (ce–zr/go) have been synthesised
using conventional wet impregnation methods. samples of ce–zr/go have been
subjected to heat treatment at various temperatures (773 k, 873 k, 973 k and
1073 k) in an attempt to enhance their catalytic performance. as-prepared ce–
zr/go sample and the corresponding heat treated samples have been assessed
for the direct synthesis for dmc from meoh and co2. furthermore, a new
innovative approach has been employed for synthesising advanced, highly
efficient and active heterogeneous catalysts via utilisation of a continuous
hydrothermal flow synthesis (chfs) reactor. tin doped zirconium oxide (zr–sn–
o) and tin doped zirconia/graphene nanocomposite (zr–sn/go) have been
assessed as suitable heterogeneous catalysts for the synthesis of dmc via the
transesterification route. the catalysts were characterised using various
analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (sem), transmission
electron microscopy (tem), powder x-ray diffraction (xrd), x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (xps), raman spectroscopy and brunauer-emmett-teller (bet)
surface area measurement.
a heterogeneous catalytic process for the synthesis of dmc has been
investigated using a high pressure reactor. the effect of various reaction
parameters such as the reactant molar ratio, catalyst loading, reaction
temperature, co2 pressure, reaction time and the use of a dehydrating agent was
studied for the optimisation of dmc synthesis. reusability studies were
conducted to evaluate the long term stability of the heterogeneous catalysts by
recycling and reusing the catalyst several times for the synthesis of dmc. tin
doped zirconia graphene oxide (sn–zr/go) nanocomposite catalyst has been
found to be the best performed catalyst for the synthesis of dmc as compared to
other catalysts evaluated in this research work. this can be attributed to the
phase composition and crystallinity of the catalyst along with the defects on the 
graphene sheet such as, holes, acid/basic groups and presence of residual which
can provide additional active catalytic sites. catalyst reusability studies evidently
showed that sn–zr/go nanocomposite can be easily recovered and reused
without any significant reduction in the catalytic performance.
response surface methodology (rsm) has track record in helping researchers in
modeling and optimisation of the experimental design for various applications in
food industry, catalysis and chemical reaction engineering. therefore, it has been
employed to evaluate the relationship between multiple process variables in order
to optimise a specified response (i.e. yield of dmc). rsm using box-behneken
design (bbd) was carried out for process modeling and optimisation, with an aim
to better understand the relationship between five operating variables (i.e.
meoh:pc molar ratio, catalyst loading (w/w), reaction temperature, reaction time
and stirring speed) and their impact on the yield of dmc. a model for the
synthesis of dmc by transesterification of pc and meoh has been developed
using bbd to compare the experimental data and the predicted results by the
bbd model. furthermore, regression analysis was applied to establish the
optimum reaction conditions for a maximising dmc synthesis. the bbd model
predicted values are in good agreement with the experimental results",london south bank university,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/913'],"[{'name': 'Saada, R'}, {'name': 'Saada, R'}]",catalytic conversion of carbon dioxide (co2) into value added chemicals,2015,,

501,84329987,,['oai:qucosa:de:qucosa:28563'],,,"europe requires significant transmission grid expansions to foster the integration of electricity markets, enhance security of supply and integrate renewable energies. however, next to lengthy authorization processes, transmission system operators (tsos) in europe are currently facing extreme public opposition in their transmission line projects leading to significant project delays. these delays imply significant additional costs for tsos as well as society as a whole and put the transformation of the european energy system at risk. existing scientific literature currently lacks comprehensive studies that have tried to identify generalizable success factors to overcome public opposition in transmission line projects. the goal of work at hand was to close this research gap. potential success factors were collected through extensive literature review and interviews throughout europe with respective stakeholders such as citizen action groups, ngos or energy experts. experiences from analogue large infrastructure projects like wind parks, carbon capture and storage facilities, hydro dams, nuclear waste repositories, etc. were also used to form hypotheses. the findings were transformed into a structural equation model and tested through a questionnaire answered by almost all european tsos.

results revealed that people’s trust in the tso is of utmost importance for less public opposition. it can be regarded as the critical success factor per se. tsos can create trust through stakeholder participation, sufficient communication, proper organizational readiness and liaison with stakeholders. furthermore, appropriate technical planning can help to reduce public opposition in transmission line projects. in total 18 concrete and actionable success factors were identified for tso management to facilitate the establishment of these aforementioned aspects. they will help european tsos to reduce public opposition and thus accelerate the implementation of new transmission lines. interestingly, economic benefits for people did not turn out to be a significant success factor in reducing their opposition against new transmission lines.:contents i

502,25882510,,['oai:dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk:1826/9983'],,thesis,"uk (united kingdom) infrastructure networks are fundamental for maintaining
societal and economic wellbeing. with infrastructure assets predominantly
founded in the soil layer (< 1.5m below ground level) they are subject to a range
of soil-related geohazards. a literature review identified that geohazards
including, clay-related subsidence, sand erosion and soil corrosivity have
exerted significant impacts on uk infrastructure to date; often resulting in both
long-term degradation and ultimately structural failure of particular assets.
climate change projections suggest that these geohazards, which are
themselves driven by antecedent weather conditions, are likely to increase in
magnitude and frequency for certain areas of the uk through the 21st century.
despite this, the incorporation of climate data into geohazard models has
seldom been undertaken and never on a national scale for the uk.
furthermore, geohazard risk assessment in uk infrastructure planning policy is
fragmented and knowledge is often lacking due to the complexity of modelling
chronic hazards in comparison to acute phenomenon such as flooding. with hm
government's recent announcement of £50 million planned infrastructure
investment and capital projects, the place of climate resilient infrastructure is
increasingly pertinent. the aim of this thesis is therefore to establish whether
soil-related geohazard assessments have a role in ensuring climate-resilient uk
infrastructure.
soil moisture projections were calculated using probabilistic weather variables
derived from a high-resolution version of the ukcp09 (uk climate projections2009) weather generator. these were then incorporated into a geohazard
model to predict great britain's (gb) subsidence hazard for the future scenarios
of 2030 (2020-2049) and 2050 (2040-2069) as well as the existing climatic
baseline (1961-1990). results suggest that gb is likely to be subject to
increased clay-related subsidence in future, particularly in the south east of
england.
this thesis has added to scientific understanding through the creation of a
novel, national-scale assessment of clay subsidence risk, with future
assessments undertaken to 2050. this has been used to help create a soil-
informed maintenance strategy for improving the climate resilience of uk local
roads, based on an extended case study utilising road condition data for the
county of lincolnshire, uk. finally, a methodological framework has been
created, providing a range of infrastructure climate adaptation stakeholders with
a method for incorporating geohazard assessments, informed by climate
change projections, into asset management planning and design of new
infrastructure.
this research also highlights how infrastructure networks are becoming
increasingly interconnected, particularly geographically, and therefore even
minor environmental shocks arising from soil-related geohazards can cause
significant cascading failures of multiple infrastructure networks. a local
infrastructure hotspot analysis methodology and case-study is provided",cranfield university,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/23'],"[{'name': 'Pritchard, Oliver G.'}]",soil-related geohazard assessment for climate-resilient uk infrastructure,2015,,
503,37298227,,['oai:ir.lib.uwo.ca:etd-4886'],,,"the goal of this thesis is to gain an understanding of the factors promoting and hindering wind energy development (henceforth wed) from the perspective of communities and developers in ontario. ontario arguably has one of the most ambitious policies for wed in the world, centered on the green energy and green economy act, 2009 (henceforth gea). despite progressing to become canada’s leading province in installed wind energy capacity, various conflicts and roadblocks to deployment remain evident.
in response to gaps identified in literature seeking to understand the factors that impact the (un)successful deployment of wind power, the current thesis provides multiple methodological roadmaps for gaining a more holistic understanding of wed through media analysis. specific to the ontario context, the thesis aims to understand the factors that promote or hinder community support for wed. as well, the goal is to understand the factors promoting or hindering the activities of wind energy developers within the province. the aforementioned objectives are addressed through media content analysis and semi-structured interviews respectively.
while results from the media analysis suggests that social acceptance is most strongly impacted by health and economic factors, developer interviews suggest that the elimination of local planning for wed has created major disconnects between developers and host communities. this disconnect has consequently compromised the deployment of the technology.
the study makes methodological, theoretical and policy contributions to existing literature on wed. methodologically, the study demonstrates the efficacy of media content analysis for understanding the temporal evolution of social responses to wed and developing interview instruments. the study also provides an original methodological protocol for the utilization of media analysis to understand wed. theoretically, the study demonstrates the utility of holistic approaches for teasing out the most salient determinants of wed and policy outcomes. finally, the study highlights the importance of community engagement in the wed process. as well, it demonstrates the need for detailed policies to guide developers and communities in their engagement with each other",scholarship@western,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2146'],"[{'name': 'Songsore, Emmanuel T'}]",wind energy development in ontario: factors influencing deployment and policy outcomes,2015,,

507,91698593,,['oai:figshare.com:article/9479621'],,,"this thesis examines the role emotions play in the practice and sociality of palestinian solidarity activism in israel and palestine. it finds that emotion is a subtle and sophisticated, and often ambiguous, form of knowledge and perception which is implicit in forming, appraising and adjusting the relationships participants have with intimates, fellow dissenters and public discourses on identity and the regional conflict. fieldwork was based in and around jerusalem and carried out over twelve months in 2011-12. this is a highly diverse transnational field where palestinians, israelis and internationalists come together at specific times and places to practice various forms of dissent, largely but not exclusively against the socio-political conditions of the palestinians vis-à-vis israeli state policy. i present three separate propositions on weirdness, wrongness and love, which relate to three different affective dimensions; perception, morality and loyalty. each proposition also develops upon what hannah arendt defined the innate political faculties or activities of the human condition; thinking, action and judging.

the perceptive quality of finding something weird is found to produce doubt in the subjective mind, the purpose for which arendt believed thinking to be a political act. the moral appraisal that something is wrong, underwrites concerted political action in the public realm. finally judging, as the attempt to understand the world from the perspective of another, is facilitated by the discourse of love in the long-term loving relations activists have with friend and family, who are antagonistic to the aims of solidarity activism. taken together these feelings are found to flow through and inform one another, constituting a nuanced affective understanding and appraisal of our world, one that is producing and maintaining a politically engaged transnational community of dissent. this community has been fostered to a large degree by the insistence and perseverance of a small number of palestinians in villages across the west bank and east jerusalem, who call upon peoples of all creeds, colours and places to witness and experience the repression of non-violent resistance. if as researchers we are to understand the complexities of human life and practices, i believe we must carefully attend to this sophisticated form of emotional reasoning and begin to think not just about feelings, but also with feelings",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/66'],[{'name': 'Brian Callan (7189796)'}],"transnational dissent: feeling, thinking, judging and the sociality of palestinian solidarity activism",2015,,

comparing such strategies for norway and sweden. based on the operationalization of their
strategies into goals and indicators, it is possible to reflect upon whether norway and sweden are
on a sustainable development path. the background for the thesis is the threat of climate change
on the planet and its boundaries that may cause irreversible damages to future generations. the
starting point is the concept of sustainable development by the world commission on
environment and development (wced) in 1987 (p. 8). the rio-initiative in 1992 addressed the
climate threat among other sustainable development issues in agenda 21 by asking nations to
develop national sustainable development strategies (unced, 1992). such strategies and
processes were studied by dalal-clayton (1996) in getting to grips with green plans. his
framework of key lessons and guiding principles is the foundation for this thesis. the first
norwegian and swedish plans are part of his study. his findings produced a basis, which are
useful for the exploration of the most recent strategies.
three research questions are defined, and the thesis is divided into corresponding parts. the
research questions are seen in the light of two broad paradigms, weak sustainability and strong
sustainability (neumayer, 2013). the research strategy for the thesis is exploratory and abductive
with a qualitative approach using mostly secondary data on the two strategies and statistics on the
indicators studied. the methods used are discourse and document analysis. the primary data
from a few key informants provide background information and verify some of the findings. the
first part finds that the norwegian and swedish strategies primarily have a weak understanding of
sustainability. the second part explores the operationalization of strategies into goals and indicators for the two
main themes of the thesis, namely climate change and intergenerational justice. the framework
of organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) and the stiglitz
commission form the basis for the discussion of indicator approaches chosen by norway and
sweden. norway has chosen a capital approach with sub-themes to account for the economic,
social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. the main indicator for
intergenerational justice in the norwegian strategy is national wealth and non-declining welfare over time (st.prp. nr. 1 (2007-2008), 2007). on the other hand, the swedish strategy has chosen
an overall environmental goal for sustainable development where 16 environmental quality
objectives represent intergenerational justice (comm. 2005/06:126, 2005). the statistical data on
the indicators show that norway and sweden will probably not meet their targets for climate
mitigation by 2020. it may be questioned whether they are taking their burden of climate
mitigation and are sustainable in the long run.
the third part of the thesis discusses the data for climate change and intergenerational justice
using two paradigms, weak and strong, as an analytical tool. it is demonstrated that it matters
whether one uses weak sustainability or strong sustainability to determine how norway and
sweden are contributing to global and national sustainability. the implications of applying weak
sustainability may hinder norway and sweden in being on a sustainable development path
towards 2020 and 2050. if applying the strong sustainability paradigm, neither norway nor
sweden appears to be on a sustainable development path. granted that there are uncertainties
about the future, the likelihood of becoming carbon natural by 2050 may also be jeopardized","university of stavanger, norway",['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1826'],"[{'name': 'Optjernsberget, Hilde'}]",on a sustainable development path? a comparative case study of norway and sweden’s national sustainable development strategies and indicators,2015,,

to go beyond the quantitative understanding, this thesisfocuses on the micro-politics of everyday life that shape the effects energy transitions projects have on different groups of people. itconsiders how power, politics and culture are vital for understanding the successes and failures of these projects. theoretically the thesis conceives low carbon projects as low carbon assemblages to understand their fluid and contingent nature and the ways in which they are configured and reconfigured through relationships of power and everyday politics. engaging with governmentality studies, it further considers how different, pre-existing and newly configured relationships of power conduct people’s conducts and sometimes lead to resistances for low carbon projects. 



the thesis critically examines three crucial aspects of low carbon energy projects by engaging with three key ideas – trusteeship, significances and resistances. firstly, it explores how, by positioning themselves as trustees, particular actors seek to assemble and govern low carbon projects in order to achieve specific outcomes. secondly, it investigates how, by focusing on particular significances of electricity, these interventions work to achieve particular development goals in different spaces of everyday life. finally, it asks how and why different pressures and contestations emerge as everyday resistances in low carbon transitions. 



the thesis takes an ethnographic route of enquiry in order to examine energy in everyday life, using participant observations, interviews and photography. it explores two different low carbon projects – lighting a billion lives (labl) solar lanterns project and husk power systems (hps) biomass micro-grids project – and contrasts them against the central grid and kerosene oil networks, in five villages in bihar.



three key arguments emerge from the thesis. firstly, electricity access should be understood as a spatially heterogeneous and temporally fluid idea. its firm quantification and standardisation are problematic because electricity access is geographically and socially differentiated.it needs to be explored in an ethnographic manner, in which not onlyquestions of ‘how much’ but also of who, how and where are critical. secondly, in energy and development projects, context matters. the society, culture, politics and economy of spaces in which projects are implemented mediate their impacts. finally, the upkeep and maintenance of low carbon energy projects is not just about economies and supply chains of spare parts but also about cooperation and coordination between the project designers and users.being able to fulfil people’s changing electricity requirements by building flexibility in the projects is critical to respond to these three issues. this will make projects more sustainable and increase people’s trust on low carbon projects leading to a convergence between energy access and energy transitions",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/32'],"[{'name': 'KUMAR, ANKIT'}]",energy access in an era of low carbon transitions: politicising energy for development projects in india,2015,,

based on theories of social practice, this thesis attempts to redress the relationship between individuals and behaviour in order to discover how energy practices are developed, maintained and reconfigured. specifically, it develops a phenomenological approach to energy consumption by exploring how energy practices are experienced by individuals on a daily basis, based on the premise that much human behaviour is driven by individuals’ perceptions of their actions. the study highlights the importance of the meanings and associations that individuals possess in relation to their energy practices and how these are implicated by their experiences, past and present. furthermore, it contends that practices are influenced by social interactional dynamics and normative frameworks within the home, as well as by the form and frequency of social relations external to the home.  
with energy consumption so closely interlocked with the practices with which individuals engage in a daily basis, this thesis suggests that policy needs to be more in tune with the everyday experiences of energy consumers. it concludes by setting out a form of policy-making that has the potential to reduce everyday energy use by being sensitive to the experiences and well-being of individuals and society","geography department, university of sao paulo",['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/504'],"[{'name': 'Hole, Nicola'}]","the policy implications of everyday energy consumption:  the meanings, temporal rhythms and social dynamics of energy use",2015,,

520,23985946,,['oai:www.doria.fi:10024/117763'],,thesis,"torrefaction is the partial pyrolysis of wood characterised by thermal degradation of predominantly hemicellulose under inert atmosphere. torrefaction can be likened to coffee roasting but with wood in place of beans. this relatively new process concept makes wood more like coal. torrefaction has attracted interest because it potentially enables higher rates of co-firing in existing pulverised-coal power plants and hence greater net co2 emission reductions.

academic and entrepreneurial interest in torrefaction has sky rocketed in the last decade. research output has focused on the many aspects of torrefaction – from detailed chemical changes in feedstock to globally-optimised production and supply scenarios with which to sustain eu emission-cutting directives. however, despite its seemingly simple concept, torrefaction has retained a somewhat mysterious standing. why hasn’t torrefied pellet production become fully commercialised? the question is one of feasibility.

this thesis addresses this question. herein, the feasibility of torrefaction in co-firing applications is approached from three directions. firstly, the natural limitations imposed by the structure of wood are assessed. secondly, the environmental impact of production and use of torrefied fuel is evaluated and thirdly, economic feasibility is assessed based on the state of the art of pellet making. the conclusions reached in these domains are as follows.

modification of wood’s chemical structure is limited by its naturally existing constituents. consequently, key properties of wood with regards to its potential as a co-firing fuel have a finite range. the most ideal benefits gained from wood torrefaction cannot all be realised simultaneously in a single process or product. although torrefaction at elevated pressure may enhance some properties of torrefied wood, high-energy torrefaction yields are achieved at the expense of other key properties such as heating value, grindability, equilibrium moisture content and the ability to pelletise torrefied wood. moreover, pelletisation of even moderately torrefied fuels is challenging and achieving a standard level of pellet durability, as required by international standards, is not trivial. despite a reduced moisture content, brief exposure of torrefied pellets to water from rainfall or emersion results in a high level of moisture retention. based on the above findings, torrefied pellets are an optimised product.

assessment of energy and co2-equivalent emission balance indicates that there is no environmental barrier to production and use of torrefied pellets in co-firing. a long product transport distance, however, is necessary in order for emission benefits to exceed those of conventional pellets. substantial co2 emission reductions appear possible with this fuel if laboratory milling results carry over to industrial scales for direct co-firing.

from demonstrated state-of-the-art pellet properties, however, the economic feasibility of torrefied pellet production falls short of conventional pellets primarily due to the larger capital investment required for production. if the capital investment for torrefied pellet production can be reduced significantly or if the pellet-making issues can be resolved, the two production processes could be economically comparable. in this scenario, however, transatlantic shipping distances and a dry fuel are likely necessary for production to be viable.

based on demonstrated pellet properties to date, environmental aspects and production economics, it is concluded that torrefied pellets do not warrant investment at this time. however, from the presented results, the course of future research in this field is clear","åbo akademi university, johan gadolin process chemistry centre",['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/987'],"[{'name': 'Agar, David A.'}]",the feasibility of torrefaction for the co-firing of wood in pulverised-fuel boilers,2015,,

china is of particular interest to statkraft even though it does not have significant investment in the chinese market yet. the rationale is that china is believed to be the price setting country for most power generation technologies, particularly coal, solar pv, wind and potential nuclear through 2035. given that china is already the top country in terms of newly installed capacity every year for these technologies, and that china has developed its own technologies and supply chain capabilities, it is not surprising to conclude that other markets, especially the emerging markets under this project will have their costs converging to that of china in the long term.
therefore this particular project focuses on two aspects: the chinese supply chain and export potential of chinese technologies, and costs of power generation technologies up to 2035 in china. the broad project limits the scope to coal, ccgt, solar pv and onshore wind in china, brazil, chile, peru, india and turkey. this project will also touch upon nuclear as it is a very important part of chinese energy mix in the long term, and is currently being promoted by the chinese government as one of the two pillars of chinese machinery export.
chinese technologies, domestic installed capacity, current and historical export, production capacity, future production expansion were studies both quantitatively and qualitatively. it is concluded that except ccgt, china will be the price setting country for toc for solar pv, wind, and coal and nuclear through 2035. therefore in the actually modelling of other countries, their assumptions were adjusted slightly so that they costs will converge to that of china through 2035.
both technical and financial data including capex, opex, capacity factor, availability, fuel efficiency, construction time, and owner costs were collected for projects that were recently commissioned or planned in china. assumptions such as wacc, economic lifetime and fuel 
prices were collected from renowned sources and adjusted to the judgement of the author and statkraft on current and forecasted market conditions.
the results of the simulation confirms the hypothesis that coal will remain to be the cheapest sources of electricity in china through 2035 without taking into account any carbon pricing, additional pollution controls or curtailment. wind is already a relatively cheap source of electricity that will be comparable to nuclear by 2020 and approaching the cost of coal by 2035. solar pv will see the sharpest cost decline in the next two decades.nhhma",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1826'],"[{'name': 'Miao, Baoqing'}]",outlook of power generation technology cost in china : a master thesis written in collaboration with statkraft as,2015,,

the co2 concentration typical of power plant exhaust gas (up to 15-18%) enhances lipid productivity, notwithstanding the inhibition effects on pigment synthesis. the optimal ph has been found to be 7.0, but satisfactory microalgae and lipid productivities have been obtained at low ph. the ability of microalgae to be active still a low ph suggests the real possibility to adopt acid conditions to preserve cultures from contamination. continuous light for 24 hour did not affect the biomass and lipid productivity.
the kinetic characterization of the photosynthetic reaction centres in microalgae by means of fluorescence methodology pointed out that: at irradiance lower than 1000 μe m-2 s-1 the photochemical process is controlled by the photons capture while at higher irradiance the photoinhibition competes with the photochemical quenching. the time-scale of repairing process is larger than the other photochemical process whatever the investigated irradiance.
the optimization of the alkaline direct transesterification was carried out on stichococcus bacillaris and validate on microalgal strains characterized by a different cell wall structure. triglycerides were not converted without an alkaline catalyst and approached a maximum conversion at a catalyst concentration of 1.5% naoh (w/w). under alkaline conditions the pre-mixing time did not affect bio-oil yield; the bio-oil yield increased with temperature and approached a maximum at around 65°c; the bio-oil yield did not change significantly with the methanol to biomass weight ratio when the methanol is not limiting; the bio-oil yield gradually increased within the first minutes of reaction. biomass drying was observed to play an important role in direct transesterification: the bio-oil yield reduced with an increase in biomass water content. a higher bio-oil yield was obtained increasing the methanol/wet biomass ratio. under alkaline catalyzed conditions the direct transesterification process was more efficient than the acidic ones.
the characterization of the specific growth rate and the biomass composition during the day/night cycle of nannochloropsis sp. was carried out by means of a turbidosotat photobioreactor. two irradiation strategy were been investigated :""constant irradiance day/night cycle"" 16 h of light at 600 μe m-2 s-1 and 8 h of dark; ""circadian cycle"" 16 h of irradiation at intensity characterized by time-sinusoidal path and maximum of 1500 μe m-2 s-1 and 8 h of dark. the role of circadian clock and of the cell division of nannochoropsis sp. has been highlighted during tests. the fraction of carbohydrate, protein and lipid of the biomass changes over the day: the lower value has been measured after the cell division, while the maximal values were obtained before cell division. the harvesting during the day of the biomass should be carried out when the concentration of the selected constituent is high.
a model to describe the change of the specific growth rate of microalgae during the day was been proposed and validated.
the optimization on new photobioreactor systems needs to take into account the different time scale of the photochemical process and the instantaneous growth rate of microalgae. analysis of the microalgal circadian clock is necessary to understand the right instant of the day at which to harvest the biomass with the set composition. it is also possible suggesting to develop systems to maximize the production of microalgal fractions (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) according to the application of the process. however, the exploitation of only one microalgal fraction may not be in agreement with the maximum economic profit of the process",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/421'],"[{'name': 'Gargano, Immacolata'}]",intensive culture of autotrophic microalgae for energy vector production,2015,,

the increased power consumption of the electrolyser results in a rise in electrode degradation which is responsible for the decrease in electrode lifetime. a method for prolonging the electrode lifetime is proposed through a metallic “oxygen-getter”. implementation of this has shown to prevent cathodic corrosion of the electrode material and thus reduces oxide layer formation. electrode lifetime in an alkaline electrolyser increased, but the commercial trend is shifting towards the more attract pem technology for electrolysis due to higher current densities, ability to handle variable input loads and non-caustic liquid requirement.

532,22294216,,['oai:scholar.sun.ac.za:10019.1/97873'],,,"thesis (phd)--stellenbosch university, 2015.english abstract: since the production of second-generation biofuel (sgb) from lignocellulosic plant biomass is only economically attractive if driven by government incentives, stakeholders are reluctant to commercialise the product despite its potential to mitigate global warming and socio-economic conditions. integrating sgb processes with the facilities of biomass-based industries could reduce the production costs of sgb through pre-existing services and infrastructure. integrating sgb, however, is technically viable only if available biomass residues are used effectively to co-produce fuel while maintaining the overall energy balance, financially viable only if it attracts private investment without governmental assistance and environmentally viable only if it reduces the carbon imprint of a fossil-intensive host industry.
in this dissertation, novel scenarios for integrating sgb with the south african raw sugar and the pulp and paper industries (rsi and p&pi, respectively) were explored. focus was on ethanol production based on fermenting hemicellulose substrates, potentially available in both industries, and on sgb production through gasification-synthesis processes in the contextual representatives of these industries. this was accomplished through flow-sheet analysis in aspen plus® using process simulations constructed from protocols in published literature and experimental data.
in respect of rsi, integrating bioethanol production with electricity from sugarcane bagasse and harvesting residues were deemed both technically and economically viable and competitive against the exclusive generation of electricity. the necessity of pinch point analysis was established through flow-sheet analysis, which had also shown the synergistic interaction of technologies in various processing stages, such as the variants in ethanol distillation technologies and heat and power production technologies. in respect of p&pi, represented by sulphite mills, ethanol production from spent sulphite liquor (ssl) pulping residue was deemed economically viable if the ssl fermentation substrate was concentrated. to attain net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions for the integrated ethanol-sulphite facility, it was essential to provide all process energy requirements from supplementary biomass sources rather than coal.
in respect of rsi, integrating methanol or fischer-tropsch syncrude via gasification synthesis was deemed not feasible at the current state of efficiency with which sugar mills are operating. in respect of p&pi, combining synthetic fuel production with bioethanol production at a sulphite mill improved economic potential, since disposal costs were negated through the use of waste biomass for synthesis processes and the yield of valuable products was enhanced on a small scale. in respect of both rsi and p&pi, however, integrating gasification-synthesis processes required the statistical optimisations of flow sheets to arrive at the optimum operating parameters for competing technologies for syngas production. in these contexts, syngas production based on optimised allothermal gasification had lower costs than optimised autothermal gasification.
to validate the process concepts developed in this thesis, it is firstly recommended that robust and recombinant microbial strains be readily available to ferment pentose-rich substrates, such as ssl and hemicellulose hydrolysates. secondly, the effect of the chemical alteration of ssl on the recovery performance of process chemicals at sulphite mills should be examined and, thirdly, the catalytic gasification of biomass should be developed and demonstrated on pilot and pre-commercial scales.afrikaanse opsomming: aangesien die produksie van tweedegenerasie-biobrandstof (tgb) uit lignosellulosiese plantbiomassa slegs ekonomies aantreklik is indien dit deur staatsaansporings aangemoedig word, is belanghebbendes huiwerig om die produk te kommersialiseer, ondanks die potensiaal daarvan om aardverwarming teen te werk en sosio-ekonomiese omstandighede te verbeter. die integrasie van tgb-prosesse by die fasiliteite van biomassagebaseerde nywerhede kan die produksiekoste van tgb verlaag deur voorafbestaande dienste en infrastruktuur. die integrasie van tgb is egter slegs tegnies haalbaar indien die beskikbare biomassareste doeltreffend gebruik word vir die medeproduksie van brandstof terwyl die algehele energiebalans terselfdertyd gehandhaaf word; slegs finansieel haalbaar indien dit privaat belegging sonder staatshulp lok, en slegs omgewingshaalbaar indien dit die koolstofvoetspoor van ’n fossielintensiewe gasheernywerheid verklein.
hierdie verhandeling verken nuwe scenario’s vir die integrasie van tgb by die suid-afrikaanse ru-suiker- en pulp-en-papierbedryf (rsb en p&pb onderskeidelik). die klem val op etanolproduksie op grond van die fermentasie van hemisellulose-substrate, wat moontlik in albei nywerhede beskikbaar is, en op tgb-produksie deur vergassingsinteseprosesse in die kontekstuele verteenwoordigers van die twee nywerhede. dít is gedoen met behulp van vloeikaartontleding in aspen plus®, wat gebruik gemaak het van prosessimulasies wat op grond van protokolle in gepubliseerde literatuur en eksperimentele data saamgestel is.
wat rsb betref, blyk die integrasie van bio-etanolproduksie en elektrisiteit uit suikerrietbagasse en oesreste tegnies én ekonomies haalbaar te wees, sowel as mededingend vergeleke met die uitsluitlike opwekking van elektrisiteit. die vloeikaartontleding het ’n behoefte aan knyppuntanalise uitgewys, wat ook gedui het op die sinergistiese wisselwerking tussen tegnologieë in verskillende verwerkingstadia, soos verskillende etanolsuiwering en hitte- en kragproduksie tegnologieë. met betrekking tot p&pb, in soverre dit deur sulfietmeule in suid-afrika verteenwoordig word, word etanolproduksie uit gebruikte sulfietloog (gsl), synde ’n pulp-residu, as ekonomies haalbaar beskou indien die gsl-fermentasiesubstraat gekonsentreerd is. om ’n netto vermindering in kweekhuisgasvrystellings vir die geïntegreerde etanolsulfietfasiliteit te verkry, moet daar met behulp van aanvullende biomassabronne eerder as steenkool in alle prosesenergievereistes voorsien word.
by rsb blyk die integrasie van metanol of fischer-tropsch- sintetiese ruolie (“syncrude”) via vergassingsintese nie teen die huidige bedryfsdoeltreffendheid van die suikermeule uitvoerbaar te wees nie. vir p&pb toon die kombinasie van sintetiese brandstofproduksie en bio-etanolproduksie by ’n sulfietmeul ekonomiese potensiaal, aangesien wegdoeningskoste geneutraliseer word deur die gebruik van afvalbiomassa vir sinteseprosesse en die kleinskaalse verhoging in die lewering van waardevolle produkte. tog vereis die integrasie van vergassingsinteseprosesse by rsb sowel as p&pb die statistiese optimalisering van vloeikaarte om die optimale bedryfsparameters van wedywerende tegnologieë vir singasproduksie te bepaal. in hierdie verband blyk singasproduksie met behulp van geoptimaliseerde allotermiese vergassing meer kostedoeltreffend as geoptimaliseerde outotermiese vergassing te wees.
vir die bekragtiging van die proseskonsepte wat uit hierdie tesis spruit, word daar eerstens aanbeveel dat robuuste en rekombinante mikrobiese stamme geredelik beskikbaar moet wees om pentoseryke substrate, byvoorbeeld gsl en hemisellulose-hidrolisate, te fermenteer. tweedens behoort die uitwerking van die chemiese wysiging van gsl op die herwinningsprestasie van proseschemikalieë by sulfietmeule ondersoek te word. laastens word aanbeveel dat die katalitiese vergassing van biomassa op ’n proef- sowel as prekommersiële skaal ontwikkel en gedemonstreer word",stellenbosch : stellenbosch university,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/926'],"[{'name': 'Petersen, Abdul Muhaymin'}]",integration of second generation biofuel production into existing industrial processes for short term commercial implementation,2015,,

l'extraction et la transformation de la lignine aux produits à haute valeur ajoutée a été identifiée comme l'une des voies de bioraffinage les plus rentables dans les usines de fabrication de pâte kraft. l’extraction de la lignine, qui est une étape cruciale de la bioraffinerie intégrée, interagit à un degré élevé avec l’usine de pâte kraft. l'importance de cette interaction est renforcée par la possibilité d’augmenter la production de pâte à papier grâce l'extraction de la lignine. afin de réussir l’intégration de l’unité de bioraffinerie de la lignine dans les usines de fabrication de pâte kraft, il est nécessaire de comprendre et de traiter les interactions entre les processus d'extraction de la lignine et l’usine de pâte kraft réceptrice. de plus, il est nécessaire d'améliorer la rentabilité et la performance environnementale des procédés d'extraction de la lignine par l'amélioration de ses opérations unitaires et de répondre aux demandes énergétiques et chimiques internes au procédé. dans cette thèse, le développement et l'intégration des processus de précipitations acides dans les usines de fabrication de pâte kraft en vue d’améliorer leur performance économique et environnementale ont été étudiés.
dans la première partie de cette recherche, les effets de l'énergie de la mise en oeuvre du processus de précipitations acides sur la fabrication de la pâte kraft ont été évalués. une usine de pâte kraft canadienne représentative a été utilisée comme référence. bien que le processus de précipitations acides n’ait pas une demande en énergie considérable, l'élimination de la lignine réduit la
vi
production d'énergie de la chaudière de récupération et augmente la demande en vapeur de l’évaporateur. la production d'électricité a également diminué en raison de la diminution de la production d’énergie de la part de la chaudière. un taux d’extraction de la lignine de 15% a permis une réduction de la récupération de la production d'énergie de la chaudière de 13,5% et une augmentation de 15% de la production de pâte à papier en raison du desembouteillage de la chaudière de récupération. les déficits en énergie dans le processus kraft ont été résolus par des mesures combinant des projets d'économie d'énergie identifiés à l'aide de l'analyse pinch, d’une augmentation de la production d'énergie de la chaudière et de gazéification de la biomasse à cycle combiné. il a été montré que la lutte contre les déficits d'énergie interne était possible, mais nécessite un haut degré d'intégration d’énergie.
dans la deuxième partie de l'ouvrage, les effets sur l'équilibre chimique ont été étudiés. une approche de modélisation basée sur l'équilibre électrolytique, qui a été proposée pour estimer les variations du ph et de la composition chimique de la liqueur noire, ont été utilisés pour simuler le processus de précipitations acides. un algorithme basé sur le ratio na / s a été utilisé pour calculer les équilibres chimiques du cycle de liqueur de l’usine de pâte kraft. l’équilibrage entre na et s a été réalisé suivant plusieurs stratégies basées sur les contraintes de l'usine et sur le recyclage du filtrat nettoyé. l’élimination complète ou le recyclage excessif de filtrats de lavage ont été trouvés pour augmenter l'exigence de récupération caustique. la demande caustique pourrait être minimisée en recyclant une partie des filtrats de lavage les plus concentrés, de sorte que la perturbation de l'équilibre na / s soit minimale. l'efficacité de l'installation de lavage a également été trouvée pour affecter la demande de récupération caustique. la stratégie d’équilibrage entre na et s a également affecté les charges de récupération des cycles opératoires, notamment ceux du train de l'évaporateur, de la caustification et du four à chaux. par conséquent, les goulets d'étranglement dans les autres opérations de valorisation doivent être pris en compte lors du choix d'une stratégie de sorte que les demandes en produits chimiques soient réduits au minimum et qu’une augmentation maximale de la production de pâte à papier soit obtenue.
dans les troisième et quatrième parties de cette recherche, les possibilités de réduction des coûts des processus de précipitations acides ont été étudiées. comme la filtration et l’équipement de lavage représentent une partie importante des coûts en capital dans une usine de précipitation de la lignine, la possibilité d'améliorer la filtration de la lignine par optimisation hydrodynamique a été évaluée. les conditions hydrodynamiques au cours de coagulation et de la floculation de la
vii
lignine ont été variées et les particules de lignine précipitées ont été caractérisées en termes de propriétés de particules et de filtration. il a été trouvé que le taux de cisaillement turbulent est le paramètre hydrodynamique déterminant qui contrôle la taille et la forme des particules de la lignine précipitée. les particules les plus compactes et les plus grandes, qui peuvent être obtenus par contrôle hydrodynamique, ont présenté des propriétés de filtration et de lavage supérieures.
l'optimisation systématique des paramètres a été utilisée comme moyen d'améliorer le rendement et la performance de filtration du procédé de précipitation acide. les expériences ont été effectuées en utilisant l'approche taguchi et les résultats ont été analysés en utilisant le rapport s / n et les méthodes statistiques d'analyse de variance. la teneur de la liqueur noire en contenu solide a été identifiée comme le paramètre le plus critique, ce qui a eu la plus grande influence à la fois sur le rendement de la lignine et sur la résistance à la filtration. les paramètres optimaux définis pour la performance de filtration, qui ont produit une lignine avec la plus basse teneur en cendres de 0,09%, n'a pas fourni le rendement le plus élevé en lignine. par conséquent, il est prendre en compte qu’un compromis entre la pureté de la lignine et de processus économiques lors de l'élaboration des procédés de précipitation de la lignine pour des applications spécifiques serait nécessaire.
enfin, la faisabilité technico-économique de l'utilisation de four à chaux gaz de combustion pour l’acidifaction de la liqueur noire a été étudiée. les résultats expérimentaux ont montré qu'il est possible d'obtenir de la lignine filtrable, bien que la cinétique de l'acidification soit beaucoup plus lente. une simulation et une analyse économique ont révélé que malgré la réduction du coût en co2, le four à chaux approvisionné en gaz de combustion était économiquement moins attrayant que l'achat de co2 externe en raison des exigences de nettoyage des gaz et de la taille accrue des réservoirs d'acidification. l'analyse de sensibilité a montré que les prix et la demande de co2 du procédé doivent être considérablement plus élevés pour qu’il soit économiquement attrayant.
----------
the use of fossil fuel resources for manufacture of goods and services has dire consequences on the environment. to reduce the impact, the use of renewable raw materials and energy has been suggested, leading to a sustainable bioeconomy. the pulp and paper industry in north america is currently facing stiff economic conditions due to declining demand for traditional paper commodities, international competition and rising energy prices. the biorefinery technologies, which convert wood components to value added bio-based chemicals and products, can be a means for the pulp and paper industry to increase its revenue, diversify the product portfolio and become more sustainable in the long run. the industry is uniquely positioned to accommodate this task due to access to biomass, existing wood handling and transportation infrastructures and expertise in traditional wood products.
the extraction and conversion of lignin to value added products has been identified as one of the most profitable biorefining pathways in kraft pulping mills. extraction of lignin, a crucial step of the integrated lignin biorefinery, has a high degree of interaction with the receptor kraft pulping mill. the importance of the interaction is further enhanced by the possibility of incremental pulp production with lignin extraction. for successful implementation of the lignin biorefinery in kraft pulping mills, we should understand and address the interactions between lignin extraction process and receptor kraft pulping mill. furthermore, it is necessary to enhance the profitability and environmental performance of the lignin extraction processes by improving its operations and meeting the internal energy and chemical demands. in this thesis, the development and integration of acid precipitation process in kraft pulping mills to improve its economic and environmental performance have been investigated.
in the first part of this research, the energy impacts of implementing the acid precipitation process on the kraft pulping mill was evaluated. a representative canadian softwood kraft pulping mill have been used as the reference. although, the acid precipitation process did not have considerable energy demands, the lignin removal reduced the recovery boiler energy production and increased the evaporator steam demand. the electricity production was also decreased due to reduced recovery boiler steam production. a total of 15% lignin extraction reduced the recovery boiler energy production by 13.5% and allowed an increase of pulp production capacity by 15% through recovery boiler debottlenecking. the energy deficits in the kraft process was addressed by
ix
measures combining energy savings projects identified using pinch analysis, biomass boiler energy production increase and biomass gasification combined cycle. it was shown that addressing the energy deficits internally was feasible, but requires high degree of energy integration.
in the second part of the work, the impact of integrating a lignin biorefinery on the chemical balance of kraft pulping mill have been investigated. a modeling approach based on electrolyte equilibrium, which was proposed to estimate ph and chemical composition variations of the black liquor, have been used to simulate the acid precipitation process. a calculation sequence based on na/s balances was utilized to calculate the chemical balances of the liquor cycle of the kraft pulping mill. balancing na and s have been performed according to several strategies based on mill constraints and wash filtrate recycle. complete disposal or excessive recycle of wash filtrates have been found to increase the make-up caustic requirement. the caustic demand could be minimized by recycling a part of most concentrated wash filtrates so that disruption of the na/s balance was minimum. the efficiency of the washing setup was also found to affect the make-up caustic demand. the na and s balancing strategy also affected the loads to the recovery cycle operations including evaporator train, recausticizing and lime kiln. therefore, the bottlenecks in the other recovery operations have to be taken into account in selecting a strategy so that chemical demands are minimized and maximum pulp production increase is obtained.
in the third and fourth parts of this research, possibilities of reducing the costs of acid precipitation process have been investigated. as filtration and washing equipment represent a significant portion of capital costs in a lignin precipitation plant, the feasibility of improving lignin filtration by hydrodynamic optimization has been evaluated. the hydrodynamic conditions during lignin coagulation and flocculation were varied and the precipitated lignin particles were characterized in terms of particle and filtration properties. the turbulent shear rate was found to be the determining hydrodynamic parameter that controlled the size and shape of the precipitated lignin particles. more compact and larger particles, which could be obtained by hydrodynamic control, provided superior filtration and washing properties.
the systematic parameter optimization was used as means of improving the yield and filtration performance of the acid precipitation process. the experiments were performed using the taguchi statistical design of experiments approach and the results were analyzed using signal-to-noise ratio and analysis of variance statistical methods. the black liquor solid content have been identified as
x
the most critical parameter, which had the largest influence on both lignin yield and filtration resistance. the optimal parameters set for filtration performance, which produced lignin with lowest ash content of 0.09%, did not provide the highest lignin yield. therefore, considering trade-offs between lignin purity and process economics would be required, when developing lignin precipitation processes for specific applications.
lastly, the economic and technical feasibility of using lime kiln flue gases for black liquor acidification was investigated. the experimental results showed that it is feasible to obtain filterable lignin, however, the kinetics of the acidification was considerably slower. a simulation and economic analysis revealed that despite the elimination of co2 cost, the lime kiln flue gas supply was less attractive economically than external co2 purchase due to the gas cleaning requirements and increased size of acidification vessels. the sensitivity analysis showed that co2 price and co2 demand of the process has to be considerably higher that current values for the use of flue gases to be economically attractive",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2425'],"[{'name': 'Kannangara, Miyuru Saranga'}]",development and integration of acid precipitation based lignin biorefineries in kraft pulping mills,2015,,

crude tall oil is generated when acid is added to a separated soap phase formed in pulp cooking. this soap has to be removed from the process and by means of acidulation, sulfur and sodium cooking chemicals in the soap can be recycled back to the pulping process. acidulation is interlinked with the pulp mill chemical recovery cycle and constitutes a major intake of sulfur to the cycle. as the material streams from acidulation have effects also outside the acidulation process, emissions of acidulation were in this work calculated by considering the chemical balance of the whole pulp mill. models for a typical pulp mill and three common acidulation processes were created based on literature and upm-internal data. the emissions of the three most common acidulation processes were calculated and the sensitivity of these emissions was studied against the most important variables of both acidulation and chemical balance of the pulp mill.

it was first observed that depending on the sulfur balance of the pulp mill and acidulation inputs, an interlinked acidulation process could either increase or decrease the total emissions of the mill. second, it was seen that the emissions of an acidulation process are more sensitive to changes in the pulp mill sulfur balance than they are to changes in the acidulation process. thus, due to large variations in the sulfur balances between different pulp mills, or even at the same mill at different times, the emissions of acidulation cannot be reliably determined and separated from the emissions of pulp production. moreover, the sulfur balance, which affects the acidulation emissions the most, is optimized for pulp production, not for cto production. this supports the conclusion that acidulation emissions should be allocated to pulp, rather than to cto.
 
acidulation is an essential part of the pulp mill and an optimized way to dispose the soap. as the soap is clearly a residual stream and emissions of acidulation cannot be separated from the emissions of pulp production, no emissions can be allocated to cto. therefore, it is recommended that cto is regarded as a residue in the eu biofuel legislation.eu:n biopolttoainepolitiikka perustuu kahteen direktiiviin, uusituvan energian direktiiviin ja polttoaineiden laatudirektiiviin. nämä direktiivit asettavat biopolttoaineille kestävyyskriteerit ja esittelevät pääperiaatteet biopolttoaineiden elinkaaren kasvihuonekaasupäästölaskennalle. näitä direktiivejä on kuitenkin tulkittu eri jäsenmaissa eri tavoin, erityisesti koskien jäte- ja tähderaaka-aineiden määrittelyjä. palstoituksen kasvihuonekaasupäästöjä ei tällä hetkellä suomessa huomioida mäntyöljystä valmistetun biopolttoaineen elinkaaren päästölaskennassa, sillä raakamäntyöljy luokitellaan selluntuotannon tähteeksi. mäntyöljyn tähdestatus on kuitenkin kyseenalaistettu viitaten sen tarkoitukselliseen tuottamiseen palstoitusprosessissa. tämän diplomityön tavoitteina on luoda metodi palstoituksen päästöjen laskemiseksi, soveltaa sitä tyypillisille palstoitusprosesseille ja määrittää, voidaanko palstoituksen päästöt erottaa sellun tuotannon päästöistä. tämän perusteella diplomityössä annetaan suosituksia mäntyöljyn luokittelemiseen eu:n biopolttoainelainsäädännössä.

in the last decade.
in chapter 2, cameronand colleagues examine the synergy between
renewable energy generation goals and those for biodiversity conservation
in the mojave desert of the southwestern usa. they integrate spatial
data on biodiversity conservation value, solar energy potential, and land
surface slope angle (a key determinant of development feasibility) and
found there to be suffi cient area to meet renewable energy goals without
developing on lands of relatively high conservation value. indeed, they
found nearly 200,000 ha of lower conservation value land below the most restrictive slope angle (<1%); that area could meet the state of california’s
current 33% renewable energy goal 1.8 times over. they found over
740,000 ha below the highest slope angle (<5%)—an area that can meet
california’s renewable energy goal seven times over. their analysis also
suggests that the supply of high quality habitat on private land may be
insuffi cient to mitigate impacts from future solar projects, so enhancing
public land management may need to be considered among the options
to offset such impacts. using the approach presented here, planners could
reduce development impacts on areas of higher conservation value, and
so reduce trade-offs between converting to a green energy economy and
conserving biodiversity.
klinger and colleagues presents proof-of-concept all-carbon solar
cells in chapter 3. these solar cells are made of a photoactive side of predominantly
semiconducting nanotubes for photo-conversion and a counter
electrode made of a natural mixture of carbon nanotubes or graphite, connected
by a liquid electrolyte through a redox reaction. the cells do not
require rare source materials such as in or pt, nor high-grade semiconductor
processing equipment. they do not rely on dye for photo-conversion
and therefore do not bleach, and are easy to fabricate using a spray-paint
technique. they observed that cells with a lower concentration of carbon
nanotubes on the active semiconducting electrode perform better than
cells with a higher concentration of nanotubes. this effect is contrary to
the expectation that a larger number of nanotubes would lead to more photo-
conversion and therefore more power generation. the authors attribute
this to the presence of metallic nanotubes that provide short for photo-excited
electrons, bypassing the load. they demonstrate optimization strategies
that improve cell effi ciency by orders of magnitude and conclude that,
once it is possible to make semiconducting-only carbon nanotube fi lms
that may provide the greatest effi ciency improvement.

as a part of this research, we enhanced the capabilities of our in-house compositional wellbore simulator (utwell) to model various production and flow assurance scenarios. initially, we developed and implemented a robust gas lift model into utwell to model artificial lift technique for reservoirs with low pressure. the developed model is able to model both steady state and transient flow along with blackoil and equation-of-state compositional models. the improved version was successfully validated against a commercial simulator.

then, we applied our dynamic model to track the behavior of asphaltene during gas lift processes and evaluated the risk of asphaltene deposition. several deposition mechanisms were incorporated to study the transportation, entrainment, and deposition of solid particles in the wellbore. the simulation results illustrated the effect of light gas injection on asphaltene deposition and well performance.

finally, a step by step algorithm is presented for coupling a geochemical package, iphreeqc, with utwell. the developed model is able to model homogenous and heterogeneous, non-isothermal, non-isobaric aqueous phase reactions assuming local equilibrium or kinetic conditions. this tool was then utilized to model scale deposition in the wellbore for various scenarios. in addition, the results showed that integrating iphreeqc has promise in terms of cpu time compared to the traditional approach of reading and writing the input and output files.petroleum and geosystems engineerin",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/222'],"[{'name': 'Abouie, Ali'}]",development and application of a compositional wellbore simulator for modeling flow assurance issues and optimization of  field production,2015,,

i begin this dissertation with a survey of environmental thought that helps situate my contribution to the ongoing debates in this field, underscoring that as ecosophers pose the question of the nonhuman, in so doing they also are confronted with problems related to temporality. then, building on the concept of “utopia,” i critique a temporality that assumes infinite growth on a planet with finite resources, while constantly postponing its promises of abundance to an impossible future. the concept i propose is “uchronia”: growth-driven progress is a timeless (ou-chronos), dangerously idealized (eu-chronos) temporality, just like “utopia” refers to both a “nowhere” place and an “ideal” place (ou- and eu-topos). i draw from nietzsche’s concept of eternal return to problematize teleologies of progress: the eternal return prompts us to live our lives as though we were prepared to re-live them eternally.
in contrast with uchronia, alternative, queer eco-temporalities – i call these “anti-uchronia,” “heterochronia,” and “synchrony” – build upon and radicalize sustainability. however, not all “eco-temporalities” – alternatives to the hegemonic, in-crisis temporalities – constitute themselves as non-linear or radical – i.e not all of them are queer: i have also coined the concept of “counter-uchronia” to describe certain understandings of “sustainable growth,” justifications of geoengineering and carbon markets creation, as well as primitivist (often virilist) environmentalist discourses which respectively advocate the “return” to a golden past of harmony with (often feminized) “nature,” or technofixes and green capitalism to amend and resume growth-driven progress’ uchronian course.

546,16273001,,['oai:paduaresearch.cab.unipd.it:7970'],,thesis,"the enormous anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide is most likely one of the main reasons for the global warming and the climate change problems ([1], [2], [3]). considering the continuing and progressively growing utilization of fossil fuels, mainly in the power generation sector where fossil fuel-based combustion and gasification power plants are predominant, the development and implementation of processes that avoid the associated co2 emissions must be urgently identified. carbon dioxide capture and storage, commonly termed ccs, represents a range of technologies oriented to affordably and efficiently sequester carbon dioxide from these sources and would be a possible mid-term solution to mitigate the emissions of co2 into the atmosphere ([4]). however, the costs (especially in terms of penalties in the power plants efficiency) associated with the current industrially available co2 capture techniques, such as amine-based scrubbing, are prohibitively high, thus making the development of new co2 sorbents an highly important research challenge.  

among several strategies currently under investigation, calcium oxide (cao), readily obtained through a calcination stage of naturally occurring calcium carbonate (caco3), has been proposed as an alternative co2 solid sorbent that could significantly reduce the costs of carbon dioxide capture systems. the technique, widely discussed in the literature and recently reviewed by several authors ([5], [6], [7] and [8]), is based on the reversible reaction cao (s) + co2 (g) ↔ caco3 (s) and is applied through cyclic stages of carbonation and of calcination, offering a number of advantages. however, a few issues, including especially the decline of sorbent capacity when they are cycled through multiple co2 capture-and release stages, still call into question its widespread deployment on industrial applications. the improvement of this technology and the development of new calcium-based solid sorbents are currently a matter of study and, despite the apparent simplicity of the chemistry involved, several aspects of the carbonation reaction and its kinetics are still not clearly understood. 

the determination of the surface reaction kinetic parameters is one of the open disputes. several contributions investigating the carbonation reaction and its kinetics have reported thus far activation energies varying in a range of about 20 ÷ 30 kj/mol ([9], [10]) and 70 ÷ 80 kj/mol ([11], [12], [13], [14]); a few authors otherwise asserted that the carbonation reaction has a zero-activation energy ([15], [16]). these values were estimated from cao conversion versus time profiles obtained from co2 absorption analysis carried out in a wide range of operating conditions in terms of carbonation temperatures and co2 partial pressures and hence, the observed uncertainty in the mentioned activation energies is reasonably related to the quality of the experimental data. the accuracy of the experimental data is a questionable matter especially when the data are obtained through the thermo-gravimetric approach because, as well known, tga experiments are typically affected by mass transfer limitations. the external diffusion is particularly important because it weighs on the gas (co2) diffusion towards the solid sorbent (cao) surface that is essential to support the carbon dioxide mole consumption due to the chemical reaction. even though several strategies can be applied to reduce the external mass diffusion during the cao carbonation studied in a tga system (typically increasing the gas flow rates), evidences of a complete removal of such resistance cannot be easily provided. in fact, the typical circumstance that at high gas flow rates the conversion versus time curves can show no changes when increasing the gas flow rate does not imply that the external mass diffusion resistance is eliminated, but only that such resistance cannot be further reduced in the tga geometry and operating conditions used. indeed, the local velocities reached around/inside a tga crucible (especially above the sorbent particles contained in a common sample holder) could be low even when the average velocity in the furnace is increased by increasing the gas flow rate, so that the local velocities around/inside a tga crucible cannot be increased enough to compensate the very high consumption rate of co2 due to the fast carbonation surface reaction. therefore, alternative method has to be studied in order to measure cao conversion versus time profile actually not limited by the external mass diffusion, and to check the validity of the thermo-gravimetric data currently available.

a second aspect concerns the structural properties characterizing the solid sorbent particles and how such properties can affect the co2 absorption performances of cao. since, cao-co2 is a typical gas-solid reaction, it is most likely that specific surface and pore volume distribution can affect the reaction kinetics of cao sorbent particles, as well as their absorption capacity. several studies have been carried out to comprehend the carbonation reaction and kinetics in terms of these structural properties (porosity, specific surface, structural parameter, or the whole pore size distribution) through the development and application of random pore/grain models ([15], [17], [10], [13], [18], [19]). most of these contributions related the transition from the fast regime to the slow product-layer diffusion controlled regime, characterizing the cao carbonation, to the filling of small pores and/or to the development of a critical carbonate layer, and focused the attention on the impact of the pore size distribution on the critical caco3 product layer thickness, for which an unambiguous value or a direct measure has not been anyway proposed. additionally, even though cao and caco3 are crystalline species and their crystalline structures could reasonably affect both the carbonation reaction kinetics and mechanism, very few contributions have been focused thus far to study their impact on the carbonation reaction, insomuch as the influence of cao/caco3 crystalline domain sizes on the carbonation reaction with cao-based solid sorbents has never been investigated.



the research project summarized in this work of thesis has been focused on the investigation of the cao carbonation reaction with the goal of clarifying these unresolved aspects. 



sorbent samples were first characterized by thermo-gravimetric analysis (tga). cao particles, directly produced in the tga apparatus through stages of thermal decomposition in n2 atmosphere (temperature range from 650°c and 900°c), were tested to investigate their reactivity in the co2 capture process, aiming at identifying the absorption specific rates, and confirming as common tga analysis are reasonably affected by physical limitations, mainly mass transfer resistances. the tga unit was fed with gas consisting of pure carbon dioxide or of a n2/co2 mixture so that different co2 partial pressures were used within a range of 0.05 and 1 bar while carbonation temperatures were varied from 450°c up to 650°c. 

some cao sorbent samples were also preliminary prepared through a stage of calcination realized in a separate muffle furnace. different operating conditions in terms of calcination temperatures (especially 900°c) and residence times at high temperature (from few minutes up to some hours) were used in order to produce cao sorbent samples with different structural properties, mainly in terms of porosity and specific surface area. in fact, these factors, which are closely related to the sorbent modifications due to high temperature treatments, reasonably affect the carbonation reaction. specific surface area measurements by n2 adsorption were performed to complete the characterization of the samples by means of bet analysis. the samples were afterwards tested during co2 absorption processes carried out in the tga unit under a gas flow of pure carbon dioxide (total pressure of 1 bar). based on cao conversions and the corresponding reaction rates measured, a simple reaction mechanism was applied to determine the kinetic parameters. an activation energy of about 45 kj/mol was estimated, but it was reasonably associated to apparent kinetic rates. moreover, the relationship between variation of the specific surface and porosity due to sintering and their effect on the carbonation reaction were not clearly quantify because of the uncertainty of the experimental data obtained, caused by the mass-transfer limitations that affected the tga experiments.

the x-ray powder diffraction technique was therefore applied since it can provide an alternative method to the thermo-gravimetric analysis for studying the cao-co2 reaction. x-ray diffraction experiments were carried out (in collaboration with the department of geosciences at the university of padova) to determine the structural changes of the sorbent samples (namely phase evolution and crystallite size modifications) as a function of temperature and co2 partial pressure. several tests were performed using a high temperature reaction chamber, with a controlled gas inlet composition, both during the thermal decomposition (calcination/regeneration) and during the absorption processes. calcination experiments, carried out in a n2 atmosphere (total pressure = 1 bar) and a temperature range varying between 650 and 950°c, allowed to observe that, after the complete decomposition of calcium carbonate precursor, the average crystallite size of cao domains formed (approximately of 40 nm) considerably changes, when kept for long residence times at high temperatures. we also verified that even a low concentration of co2 in the calcination atmosphere promotes cao crystal size growth during the caco3 thermal decomposition and significantly increases the size of the nascent cao crystalline domains. after the preparation stage of thermal decomposition, carbonation experiments using fresh calcines directly produced within the reaction chamber were performed. it was observed that differences in the crystallite size of the cao samples apparently influence the solid sorbent reactivity in the following co2 capture process. at the same carbonation isotherm (temperatures applied were in the range of 400-650°c), with a co2 partial pressure of 1 bar, samples with a larger cao crystal size (at the beginning of carbonation) showed a lower overall carbon dioxide absorption capacity, suggesting that the carbonation reaction (kinetics) could be affected by initial cao sorbent particle crystallite size. unfortunately, the low time resolution provided by the available standard laboratory instrumentation was not sufficient to obtain detailed information about the transformations occurring in the sample particles, especially during the initial very fast stage of the carbonation reaction, whereas the surface chemical reaction should reasonably occur with negligible effects of the product layer diffusion. 

therefore, in-situ synchrotron radiation x-ray powder diffraction (sr-xrpd), performed at the advanced photon source (aps) facilities of the argonne national laboratory, was finally applied to investigate the cao carbonation reaction more in detail. a set of co2 absorption experiments were conducted in a high temperature reaction capillary with a controlled atmosphere (co2 partial pressure of 1 bar), in the temperature range between 450°c and 750°c using cao based sorbents obtained by calcination of commercial calcium carbonate. the evolution of the crystalline phases during co2 uptake by the cao solid sorbents was monitored for a carbonation time of 20 min as a function of the carbonation temperature and of the calcination conditions. the rietveld refinement method was applied to estimate the calcium oxide conversion during the reaction progress and the average size of the initial (at the beginning of carbonation) calcium oxide crystallites. the measured average initial carbonation rate (in terms of conversion time derivative) of 0.280 s-1 (± 13.2% standard deviation) is significantly higher than the values obtained by thermo-gravimetric analysis and reported thus far in the scientific literature. additionally, a dependence of the conversion versus time curves on the initial calcium oxide crystallite size was observed and a linear relationship between the initial cao crystallite size and the calcium oxide final conversion was identified. the evolution of the caco3 crystalline phase during the cao carbonation was also investigated by means of the same technique. maximum sizes of the calcium carbonate crystalline domains were observed in the caco3 crystallite size versus time curves, (specifically during the first rapid stage of the carbonation) and were identified as the average values of the critical caco3 product layer thickness. a relationship between this parameter and the corresponding calcium oxide conversion (at which the transition to the second slow reaction stage occurs), as well as a dependence of the carbonate product layer thickness with the initial cao particle porosity, were found. finally, caco3 critical product layer thicknesses were used to estimate the initial specific surface areas of the cao sorbent particles afterwards utilized to calculate the kinetic parameters of the intrinsic surface carbonation reaction. a reaction rate constant of 1.89 × 10-3 mol/m2 s, with zero-activation energy, has been obtained",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/433'],"[{'name': 'Biasin, Alberto'}]",co2 capture with solid sorbents: materials characterization and reaction kinetics,2015,,

the atmosphere, which has led to the current environmental problems
such as climate change and global warming. the reduction of co2
emissions has become a global environmental challenge. greener
chemical process for utilisation of co2 in the synthesis of valuable
chemicals such as organic carbonates is one of technological
advancements aimed at reducing co2 emission into atmosphere.
organic carbonates such as ethylene carbonate (ec), propylene
carbonate (pc), butylene carbonate (bc), 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene
carbonate (vchc), (chloromethyl)ethylene carbonate (cmec) and styrene
carbonate (sc) have been used widely as intermediates in the synthesis
of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and fuel additives. the conventional
method of organic carbonates syntheses employs homogeneous
catalysts, solvents as co-catalysts and toxic raw materials including
phosgene (cocl2) and iso-cyanates (rnco), and produces carcinogenic
by-products that could have serious impact on the environment and
human health. hence, there is a need for an environmentally benign green
process for the synthesis of organic carbonate from co2.
catalysis is an important tool in designing a greener process for the
synthesis of valuable chemicals. in this work, several heterogeneous
catalysts have been synthesised using a continuous hydrothermal flow
synthesis (chfs) reactor and their catalytic activity evaluated for the
synthesis of organic carbonates by cycloaddition reaction of epoxides and
co2 under a solvent free system. the catalysts were characterised using
various analytical characterisation techniques including raman
spectroscopy (rs), scanning electron microscopy (sem), transmission
electron microscopy (tem), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and
x-ray powder diffraction (xrd). the brunauer-emmett-teller (bet) surface area and porosity measurements were conducted using
micrometrics analyser.
solvent free heterogeneous catalytic process for organic carbonate
synthesis has been investigated using a high pressure parr reactor. the
effect of various parameters such as heat-treatment temperature, catalyst
loading, co2 pressure, reaction time and reaction temperature on the
conversion of epoxides, selectivity and yield of organic carbonates was
studied for optimisation of reaction conditions. batch experimental studies
were conducted to investigate the long term stability of the catalysts by
reusing the catalysts several times for the syntheses of organic
carbonates. ceria, lanthana and zirconia graphene oxide (ce-la-zr-go)
nanocomposite catalyst has been the most active and selective for the
cycloaddition reaction as compared to other heterogeneous catalysts such
as commercially available catalysts (zr-o, ce-zr-o, la-zr-o and ce-la-zro

ce-la-zr-o and ce-la-zr-go catalysts could be reused several times

the thesis analyses both contemporary and past events influencing the present situation of forestry in the two countries, uses incorporated comparison as a specific comparative approach and is methodologically informed by notions of dialectics. analysis of discourses, observations, interviews and other methods have been put together along with theoretical reasoning on the constitution and transformation of historically specific social-ecological relations. the thesis empirically shows relations between social changes associated with forestry and theoretically draws from, and elaborates on, different forms of critical theory. an important finding of this thesis is the deep interconnection between forestry in chile and forestry in sweden. the study also shows that forestry development in chile influences the overall situation of forestry in sweden and vice versa. in this regard, forestry in the two countries has been shown to form and be formed through the historical development of world forestry. the thesis also shows how climate change has transformed discursive practices of forestry in the two countries. in addition, the thesis highlights labour questions, movement of resistance related to capitalist forestry development and specific discourses articulating forestry development in the two countries. a main conclusion of the thesis is that the conflictive nature of forestry in chile and sweden is greatly entangled with processes of environmental communication and political ecology relations; relations that are today formed to an important degree through use value and exchange value contradictions",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/385'],"[{'name': 'Alarcón Ferrari, Cristián'}]",forests at the limits,2015,,

	utilising the well-studied wet chemistry surface modification techniques of silanes and thiols, many substrates have been modified and the wettability tested. contact angle goniometry has been utilised to assess the wetting characteristics of each substrate, and the role of surface roughness has been discussed in relation to both the static young’s contact angle and the advancing and receding angles. 

	modified porous plates have been used to generate bubbles, with controlled single pore, multiple controlled pore, and multiple randomised pore systems being investigated. a steady flow of air was bubbled into distilled water through the various diffuser plates. it has been observed a contact angle of 90° is of vital importance, with a significant increase of bubble size above the 90° angle, defined as the hydrophobic wetting region. on the contrary, bubble size is greatly reduced below this angle, in the region defined as the hydrophilic region. the effect is seen to increase as the density of pores increases when the plate from which they are emitted is relatively smooth. upon roughening, the effect is seen to diminish, and mechanisms for this process have been postulated. it is thought that the surface topography disrupts the modifying layers and also physically restricts the growing bubble, preventing the growth of the bubbles emitted from a hydrophobic surface. attempts have been made to support this hypothesis both qualitatively and quantitatively. 

	the fluidic oscillator of zimmerman and tesar has been examined, with numerous physical features being investigated. the oscillator was then added to the system to investigate the effect of wettability under substantial oscillation. it has been shown that the bubble size emitted from hydrophobic surfaces is significantly reduced when compared to the steady flow system. the effect is believed to be due to the ‘suction’ component of the oscillatory flow created by the oscillator. it has been seen via high speed photography that the growth rate of the growing bubble slows significantly as the flow begins to switch, before a reduction in size is seen as the gas is removed from the bubble. the opposing forces of buoyancy and suction act to elongate the bubble neck causing break off at a significantly reduced size. although the diffuser plate is often observed to oscillate like the skin of a drum, this is not the predominant cause of the size reduction. further experiments have been conducted using a synthetic actuator jet to create a pulsed air flow with only a positive component. bubble size is not affected in this case, despite frequency sweeps being employed",university of sheffield conference proceedings,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/139'],"[{'name': 'Wesley, Daniel'}]",the role of surface wettability on bubble formation in air-water systems.,2015,,

sorption isotherms found from the experiment shows that there is a decrease of solubility as the temperature of the experiment increases for both gases in all polymers. there is also a decrease of solubility due to the presence of the other gas in the system in the mixed gas experiments due to competitive sorption effect. variation of solubility is more visible in methane sorption than carbon dioxide, which will make the mixed gas solubility selectivity higher than that of pure gas solubility selectivity. modeling of the system using nelf and dual mode sorption model estimates the experimental results correctly

very few studies have been conducted on three-phase mixing systems. in a context of carbon dioxyde hydrates (light solids of density around 860 kg/m3) formation optimization, a hydrodynamic study has been developed to determine the effect of the increasing presence of low-density inert particles (ρ=860 kg/m3) and air on the mixing performance of three different impellers : a 6 pitched-blades turbine, a six blades hollow rushton turbine (dispersimax) and a maxblend mixer. torque and wall pressure, a method still unutilized in the experiment’s condition, data were collected and since these consisted essentially of dynamic pressure data, they were supposed to help identify changes in the hydrodynamic regime. nevertheless no such changes have been clearly found either by the pressure data or the power consumption indirectly measured by the torque data. furthermore, mixing time data by electrical resistance tomography (ert) was collected to confirm the above-mentioned results, which they accomplished. in fact, no clear changes in mixing times have been denoted at the different solids concentrations. all the experiments were conducted at three different rotational speeds for each impeller and in completely developed turbulent flow regime. the solids mass fractions were varied from 0 to 25%. 
the dispersimax impeller was particularly good for bringing air into the tank, but was poor for dragging down floating particles mainly because it had to be placed in the bottom half of the tank to ensure good gas dispersion and distribution. the pbt, especially in up-pumping mode and near the free surface, was very efficient in particles drawdown and was also somewhat efficient in air entrainment from the free surface but lost quickly this ability when a thin layer of solids could not be dragged down. the maxblend mixer was also efficient for both particles drawdown and air entrainment from the free surface but lost its efficiency as soon as it was submerged.

como se tiene normalmente en aplicaciones industriales específicas. el trabajo desarrollado en esta tesis doctoral destaca el uso de técnicas de simulación molecular para la optimización de procesos relacionados con el medio ambiente. el objetivo general se centra en avanzar en el campo de materiales para la captura y separación de dióxido de carbono a condiciones de proceso. se considera de manera explícita la influencia del vapor de agua e impurezas, tanto a la luz de los fundamentos de la adsorción como en la aplicación para la captura de co2 por post-combustión mediante ciclos de

a consequence of major developments in transportation and technology, sustainable development is of special relevance, suggesting ways to mitigate greenhouse gases emissions, including carbon capture and storage (or utilization, ccsu), energy efficiency, alternative energy sources and energy savings, as already suggested by the kyoto's protocol and the ipcc reports. hence, much effort has been devoted in recent years to develop technologies for capture and storage of co2 from concentrated sources of emission. apart from establishing new technologies, over the last decades the science of porous solid materials has become one of the most intense areas of research and development for chemists, physicists, and materials scientists. in fact, considerable progress has been made in recent years on the development of novel adsorbents. for instance, metal organic frameworks (mofs) have been gaining considerable attention as promising nanoporous materials for gas storage and gas separation applications due to their exceptional physical and chemical properties, and have already been demonstrated to be promising materials in the separation of different gases, however, a molecular level understanding of gas adsorption in the pores is crucial to accelerate the design and development of these and other applications. it is also fundamental to know their behavior under moisture conditions and impurities content, as normally found at specific industrial applications. the work developed in this thesis highlights the use of molecular simulation techniques for optimizing environmental related processes, providing new procedures to assess the use of these materials from their fundamental knowledge until their applications at industrial conditions. the overall objective is to advance in the field of materials for co2 capture and separation at process conditions. the influence of water vapor and impurities is explicitly considered, both, in the light of the fundamentals of adsorption and in the application for post-combustion carbon dioxide capture by swing adsorption cycles. starting from a brief description of the fundamentals of adsorption and molecular simulations, a novel throughout review on recent studies of materials for co2 capture and separation is presented, thus providing valuable information to assess their industrial application. based on this review, some of the most promising materials for co2 separation in a temperature swing adsorption (tsa) process have been studied in detail by using molecular simulations (compared to experimental data when available), proposing a new process for the evaluation and optimization capture systems under real conditions. in addition, given the great influence of water as a trace compound on the separation, cubtc (one of the most studied mofs, stable in water and with potential for industrial application) has been investigated in comparison to the benchmark zeolite 13x. the effect of the coexisting species as well as the influence of water and so2 in flue gas is examined in detail in order to reach a better understanding of the adsorption capacity, selectivity, adsorption density location and isosteric heat distributions. and finally, detailed parametric studies have been carried out for a comparative computational investigation for separating of multi-component mixtures of flue gas by using other representative zeolites such as kaolinite and chabazite. additional work, related to another environmental problem: the separation of a pollutant

tecnología, el desarrollo sostenible es de especial relevancia pues sugiere la búsqueda de formas de mitigar las emisiones de gases de efecto invernadero, incluyendo la captura y almacenamiento de carbono (o utilización), la eficiencia energética, fuentes alternativas de energía y ahorro de energía, como ya se ha sugerido por el protocolo de kioto y los informes del ipcc. de ahí que en los últimos años se haya dedicado un esfuerzo considerable a desarrollar tecnologías para la captura y almacenamiento de co2 a partir de fuentes concentradas de emisión. además de establecer nuevas tecnologías, durante las últimas décadas la ciencia de materiales sólidos porosos se ha convertido en una de las áreas más intensas de investigación y desarrollo para químicos, físicos y científicos de materiales. de hecho, se ha avanzado considerablemente en el desarrollo de nuevos adsorbentes para diversos procesos de separación. por ejemplo, las estructuras órgano-metálicas (mofs) han ido ganando considerable atención como materiales prometedores para aplicaciones de almacenamiento y separación de gases, debido a sus propiedades excepcionales. sin embargo, es necesaria una comprensión a nivel molecular de la adsorción de gases para acelerar el diseño y desarrollo de aplicaciones a la carta. también es fundamental conocer el comportamiento bajo condiciones de humedad e impurezas, como se tiene normalmente en aplicaciones industriales específicas. el trabajo desarrollado en esta tesis doctoral destaca el uso de técnicas de simulación molecular para la optimización de procesos relacionados con el medio ambiente. el objetivo general se centra en avanzar en el campo de materiales para la captura y separación de dióxido de carbono a condiciones de proceso. se considera de manera explícita la influencia del vapor de agua e impurezas, tanto a la luz de los fundamentos de la adsorción como en la aplicación para la captura de co2 por post-combustión mediante ciclos de adsorción por oscilación. partiendo de una breve descripción de los fundamentos de la adsorción y de las simulaciones moleculares, se presenta una revisión exhaustiva de estudios recientes de materiales para captura y separación de co2, proporcionando así información valiosa para su aplicación industrial. basados en esta revisión, se han estudiado en detalle algunos de los materiales más prometedores para un proceso de adsorción por cambio de temperatura (tsa) basado en simulaciones moleculares, proponiéndose un nuevo procedimiento para la evaluación y optimización de los sistemas de captura en condiciones reales. dada la gran influencia de trazas de agua en la separación, se investiga también el cubtc (uno de los mof más estudiados y estables en agua) en comparación con la zeolita de referencia 13x. se examina en detalle el efecto de las especies coexistentes, así como la influencia del agua y so2 en los gases de combustión, con el fin de llegar a una mejor comprensión de la capacidad de adsorción, la selectividad, la localización de las moléculas en el material, las distribuciones de calor isostérico y su relación con el proceso. asimismo, se han llevado a cabo estudios paramétricos detallados para una investigación comparativa de la separación de mezclas multi-componentes de gases de combustión mediante el uso de otras zeolitas como caolinita y chabacita. y finalmente, se presenta un trabajo adicional relacionado con otro problema medioambiental: la separación de un contaminante (ibuprofeno) en agua, mediante el uso de carbones activados, usando las mismas técnicas computacionales, demostrando así la versatilidad de las herramientas empleadas para este tipo de sistemasgiven the rapid increase in population and the growth in energy consumption as a consequence of major developments in transportation and technology, sustainable development is of special relevance, suggesting ways to mitigate greenhouse gases emissions, including carbon capture and storage (or utilization, ccsu), energy efficiency, alternative energy sources and energy savings, as already suggested by the kyoto's protocol and the ipcc reports. hence, much effort has been devoted in recent years to develop technologies for capture and storage of co2 from concentrated sources of emission. apart from establishing new technologies, over the last decades the science of porous solid materials has become one of the most intense areas of research and development for chemists, physicists, and materials scientists. in fact, considerable progress has been made in recent years on the development of novel adsorbents. for instance, metal organic frameworks (mofs) have been gaining considerable attention as promising nanoporous materials for gas storage and gas separation applications due to their exceptional physical and chemical properties, and have already been demonstrated to be promising materials in the separation of different gases, however, a molecular level understanding of gas adsorption in the pores is crucial to accelerate the design and development of these and other applications. it is also fundamental to know their behavior under moisture conditions and impurities content, as normally found at specific industrial applications. the work developed in this thesis highlights the use of molecular simulation techniques for optimizing environmental related processes, providing new procedures to assess the use of these materials from their fundamental knowledge until their applications at industrial conditions. the overall objective is to advance in the field of materials for co2 capture and separation at process conditions. the influence of water vapor and impurities is explicitly considered, both, in the light of the fundamentals of adsorption and in the application for post-combustion carbon dioxide capture by swing adsorption cycles. starting from a brief description of the fundamentals of adsorption and molecular simulations, a novel throughout review on recent studies of materials for co2 capture and separation is presented, thus providing valuable information to assess their industrial application. based on this review, some of the most promising materials for co2 separation in a temperature swing adsorption (tsa) process have been studied in detail by using molecular simulations (compared to experimental data when available), proposing a new process for the evaluation and optimization capture systems under real conditions. in addition, given the great influence of water as a trace compound on the separation, cubtc (one of the most studied mofs, stable in water and with potential for industrial application) has been investigated in comparison to the benchmark zeolite 13x. the effect of the coexisting species as well as the influence of water and so2 in flue gas is examined in detail in order to reach a better understanding of the adsorption capacity, selectivity, adsorption density location and isosteric heat distributions. and finally, detailed parametric studies have been carried out for a comparative computational investigation for separating of multi-component mixtures of flue gas by using other representative zeolites such as kaolinite and chabazite. additional work, related to another environmental problem: the separation of a pollutant (ibuprofen) in water, by using activated carbons, is also presented here, demonstrating the versatility of the tools used for these types of systems","[barcelona] : universitat autònoma de

convencionales ubicados en la porción noreste de méxico. para ello, se realizó previamente una revisión bibliográfica sobre la
prospección del gas, retomando trabajos de investigación ya existentes para la cuenca de sabinas y la cuenca de chihuahua (camacho
ortegón 2009, de la o burrola, 2013), con el fin de comprender su comportamiento desde el punto de vista de los yacimientos no
convencionales.los trabajos de estos autores incluyen modelos que describen la historia termomecánica de la cuenca de sabinas, los
eventos geológicos que definen el comportamiento del sistema petrolero, su evolución y su relación con la generación de hidrocarburos.
para continuar con el desarrollo de este proyecto, se llevó a cabo una campaña de muestreo a cargo del servicio geológico mexicano
(sgm), el cual nos proporcionó un total de 50 muestras divididas entre las cuencas de sabinas y chihuahua, para su caracterización. la
caracterización general incluyó: (1) análisis inmediatos o primarios de humedad y ceniza, (2) análisis elemental para la determinación de
(c, h, o, n, y s), (3) análisis petrográfico para determinar el tipo de materia orgánica, (4) pirolisis rock-eval®6 para conocer su potencial
petrolífero. el conjunto de estos análisis nos permitieron evaluar y seleccionar 10 muestras divididas entre las cuencas de estudio, para
desarrollar los ensayos de adsorción/desorción y la interpretación de los parámetros que influyen en el proceso de adsorción.
para la cuenca de sabinas, se observaron capacidades de almacenamiento de gas metano de 202.11 scf/ton (7.07m3/ton) a 364.76
scf/ton (10.47m3/ton), mientras que en la cuenca de chihuahua se presentaron capacidades de sorción más bajas, con un rango de 0.84
scf/ton (0.023m3/ton) a 3.48 scf/ton (0.084m3/ton). estos resultados nos permitieron interpretar las características físicas y químicas que
influyen en la capacidad de almacenamiento del gas en el kerógeno. anticipando como conclusión general que: la adsorción del gas
aumenta con el rango/madurez. también se estudio la influencia de la composición maceral en el proceso de sorción y se verificó que la
capacidad de almacenamiento de gas está íntimamente relacionada al contenido de vitrinita. esto nos condujó a retomar las
declaraciones de algunos autores (chalmers y bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012) quienes verificaron que la capacidad de adsorción en
base al cot aumenta en el siguiente orden: tipo i < tipo ii < tipo iii. esto se atribuyó a que la vitrinita tiene una mayor capacidad de
adsorción, en comparación con otros tipos de macerales.
en este sentido se llevó a cabo una minuciosa observación a los modelos cinéticos y principalmente en los factores de adsorción (w)
propuestos por la versión más reciente del software petromod®12 (tipo i, w=0.80), (tipo ii w=0.75) y (tipo iii w=0.68).se encontró una
discrepancia respecto a la bibliografía reportada por (chalmers y bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012). por lo que se retomaron los resultados
de adsorción/desorción de gas de esta investigación para realizar el cálculo del factor (w), para construir y proponer un nuevo modelo
cinético aplicable al proceso simulación del software petromod®, tomando en cuenta la adsorción.
el nuevo modelo cinético nos permitió proponer un reajuste al modelado geoquímico de la cuenca de sabinas, realizando al mismo
tiempo una comparación del efecto de los factores de adsorción en el momento de la generación y expulsión de hidrocarburos. este
modelo cinético por medio del factor (w), toma en cuenta la cantidad de hidrocarburos adsorbidos en la roca generadora, induciendo un
comportamiento de carácter no convencional para la roca generadora, produciendo así un cambio en el balance de expulsión de
hidrocarburos del kerógeno.
los resultados obtenidos a partir de los análisis implementados y la construcción del modelo cinético aplicado en la presente
investigación, permitieron establecer una serie de aportaciones nuevas para los kerógenos de la cuenca de sabinas, la cuales se pueden
dividir principalmente en dos partes.
1.- para la adsorción/desorción de gas, se estudiaron las variables físico-químicas que afectan a la capacidad de sorción de gas en
muestras de carbón y shale gas (madurez/rango, composición maceral y contenido de materia mineral). con base en los resultados del
análisis de petrografía orgánica fue posible observar y verificar que existe una mayor capacidad de sorción de metano en las muestras de
carbón cuando el rango/madurez aumenta. el contenido de vitrinita es otro parámetro importante en términos de capacidad de
almacenamiento gas al ser comparado con los otros macerales, debido a su estructura microporosa. en esta investigación se pudo
verificar que la cantidad de gas adsorbido se incrementa con el aumento del contenido de vitrinita, por el contrario, se producen curvas
más bajas de adsorción de gas en muestras con un mayor contenido de inertinita. también se verificó que el incremento del contenido de
materia mineral implica una disminución en la capacidad de sorción de gas en el carbón.
2.- por otra parte el nuevo modelo cinético propuesto en este trabajo y su implementación en el proceso de simulación de la cuenca de
sabinas, permitió realizar un reajuste en el balance de expulsión de hidrocarburos en la roca generadora. para conocer el efecto del
modelo cinético durante el proceso de simulación, se realizó un análisis comparativo entre el modelo cinético con un factor (w) =0.92
propuesto para este trabajo, respecto al mismo modelo cinético utilizando un factor (w) = 0.68 como parámetro estándar propuesto por el
software petromod®12para el kerógeno tipo iii.esto nos permitió observar las variaciones generadas a partir de su aplicación, las cuales
nos indican que el modelo es altamente sensible al factor (w), ya que induce cambios en la expectativa de la migración de hidrocarburos
y carga de los almacenes.l'objectif principal de cette recherche a été de réaliser une étude des propriétés d'adsorption/désorption du gaz dans les réservoirs non
conventionnels situés dans la partie nord-est du mexique. nous avons commencée par un revue de la littérature concernant a l'exploration
de gaz, reprenant des recherches existantes sur le bassin de sabinas et le bassin de chihuahua (camacho-ortegón 2009, de la o
burrola, 2013) afin de comprendre leur comportement du point de vue de réservoirs non conventionnels. ces auteurs proposent des
modèles qui décrivent l'histoire thermomécanique du bassin de sabinas, des événements géologiques qui définissent le comportement du
système pétrolier, son évolution et sa relation avec la production d'hydrocarbures.
nous avons réalisé une campagne d'échantillonnage en collaboration avec le servicio geológico mexicano (sgm) au mexique. ils nous
ont proposé un total de 50 échantillons répartis entre le bassin de sabinas et chihuahua pour leur caractérisation. cette caractérisation
générale inclus: (1) analyse immédiate ou primaire de l'humidité et de cendre (2) analyse élémentaire pour déterminer (c, h, o, n, et s),
(3) analyse pétrographique pour déterminer le type de matière organique (4) pyrolyse rock-eval®6 afin de connaître son potentiel
pétrolier. toutes ces analyses nous ont permis de sélectionner 10 échantillons entre les deux bassins de l'étude, afin de développer nous
essais d‘expérimentation d'adsorption/désorption de gaz et interpréter ainsi par les courbes de langmuir les paramètres affectant le
processus d'adsorption du ch4 et co2.
pour le bassin de sabinas, ont été mesurés des capacités de stockage de gaz méthane à partir de 202.11 scf/tonne (7.07 m3/tonne) à
364,76 scf/tonne (10.47 m3/tonne), alors que pour le bassin du chihuahua les capacités de sorption sont plus faibles, variant de 0,84
scf/tonne (0.023 m3/tonne) à 3,48 scf/tonne (0.084 m3/tonne). ces résultats nous ont permis d'apporter une interprétation des
caractéristiques physiques et chimiques qui influent sur la capacité de stockage de gaz dans le kérogène des roches sédimentaires de
type shale gas. nous avons trouvé que dans les bassins étudies l'adsorption de gaz augmente avec le rang/maturité des matières
organiques sédimentaires. nous avons également étudiée l'influence de la composition macérale sur les processus de sorption et nous
avons vérifié que la capacité de stockage de gaz, est étroitement liée à la teneur en vitrinite. cela nous conduit à prendre en considération
les publications de certains auteurs (chalmers et bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012) qui ont vérifié dans leurs travaux que les augmentations
de la capacité d'adsorption sur la base du cot sont dans l'ordre suivant: le type i <type ii <type iii. cela a été attribué à la capacité
d'adsorption précoce de la vitrinite par rapport aux autres types de macéraux.
à cet égard, en effectuant une observation approfondie sur les modèles cinétiques principalement sur les facteurs d'adsorption (w)
proposé par la dernière version du logiciel petromod®12 (type i, w = 0,80), (type ii w = 0,75) et (type iii w = 0,68), a été constaté un
écart par rapport à la littérature rapporté par (chalmers et bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012). nous avons pris en compte en conséquence
nous résultats de gaz d'adsorption/désorption pour effectuer le calcul du facteur (w) et construire et proposer un nouveau modèle
cinétique pour nous bassins avec la simulation du software petromod®, en prenant en compte l'adsorption.
le nouveau modèle cinétique nous a permis de proposer un re-ajustement et optimisation à la modélisation géochimique du bassin de
sabinas, et réaliser ainsi au même temps une comparaison de l'effet des facteurs d'adsorption au moment de la production
d'hydrocarbures et de l'expulsion. ce modèle cinétique avec le nouveau factor (w), prend en compte la quantité d'hydrocarbures
adsorbés par les matières organiques de la roche avec un comportement pétrolier non conventionnel, que se traduit par des variations
importantes dans bilan d'expulsion des hydrocarbures du kérogène.
les résultats obtenus a partir de l'analyse et la construction d'un modèle cinétique appliquée dans notre étude a permis d'établir un certain
nombre de nouvelles informations sur le comportement cinétique du kérogène du bassin sabinas, lesquelles peuvent être divisés
principalement en deux parties.
1. les propriétés d'adsorption/désorption de gaz, les plus importantes qui affectant la capacité de sorption de gaz des échantillons de
charbon et de shale gas sont : maturité/rang, composition macérale et le contenu de la matière minérale. ces résultats de l'analyse
pétrographique montrent en particulier une capacité de sorption élevée de méthane dans des échantillons de charbon lorsque le %prv
augmente. la teneur en vitrinite est également un paramètre important en termes de capacité de stockage de gaz par rapport aux autres
macéraux, en raison de sa structure microporeuse. dans cette étude, il a été constaté que la quantité de gaz adsorbée qui augmente avec
la teneur en vitrinite, peut diminuer aussi avec des teneurs en inertinite élevées. finalement l'augmentation de la teneur en matière
minérale produit aussi une diminution de la capacité de sorption de gaz dans le charbon.
2. le nouveau modèle cinétique proposé dans notre recherche a permis un réalignement dans le bilan de l'expulsion des hydrocarbures
des roches mères de nous bassins. l‘analyse comparative de la cinétique du modèle avec un facteur (w) = 0,92 proposé par les
résultats de notre étude et celui proposé par le même modèle cinétique standard utilisant un facteur (w) = 0,68 proposée par le logiciel
petromod®12 pour le kérogène du type iii, nous a permis d'observer des variations importantes de genèse et migration du pétrole lors du
remplissage des roches réservoirs conventionnelles.o principal objetivo desta pesquisa é o estudo das propriedades de adsorção/dessorção de gás em reservatórios não-convencionais
localizados na zina nordeste do méxico. para isso, foi previamente realizada uma revisão da literatura sobre exploração de gás
retomando trabalhos de investigação já existentes da bacia de sabinas e da bacia de chihuahua (camacho-ortegón, 2009; de la o
burrola, 2013) a fim de compreender o seu comportamento do ponto de vista dos reservatórios não-convencionais. as obras desses
autores incluem modelos que descrevem a história termomecânica da bacia de sabinas, eventos geológicos que definem o
comportamento do sistema petrolífero, a sua evolução e a sua relação com a geração de hidrocarbonetos.
no decurso do desenvolvimento deste projeto, foi efectuada uma campanha de amostragem pelo servicio geologico mexicano (sgm),
fornecendo um total de 50 amostras para caracterização, divididas entre as bacias de sabinas e de chihuahua. a classificação geral
inclui: (1) análise imediata ou primária de humidade e cinzas, (2) análise elementar para a determinação de c, h, o, n e s, (3) análise
petrográfica para determinação do tipo de matéria orgânica, (4) pirólise por rock-eval 6, para conhecer o potencial petrolífero. este
conjunto de análises permitiu avaliar e selecionar 10 amostras, divididas entre as bacias em estudo, para efectuar os ensaios de
adsorção/dessorção de gas e interpretar os parâmetros que afectam o processo de adsorção.
para a bacia sabinas, foram observadas capacidades de armazenamento de gás metano entre 202,11 scf/ton (7.07m3/ton) e 364,76
scf/ton (10.47m3/ton), enquanto que para a bacia chihuahua as capacidades de adsorção são mais baixas, variando entre 0,84 scf/ton
(0.023m3/ton) e 3,48 scf/ton (0.084m3/ton). estes resultados permitiram fazer a interpretação das características físicas e químicas que
influenciam na capacidade da armazenamento de gás no cerogénio. antecipando como uma conclusão geral, a adsorção de gás aumenta
com o rang/maturação. também se estudou a influência da composição maceral sobre o processo de adsorção verificando-se que a
capacidade de armazenamento de gás está intimamente relacionado com o conteúdo em vitrinite, o que levou a retomar os resultados de
alguns autores (chalmers e bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012) que verificaram que a capacidade de adsorção com base no toc aumenta
na seguinte ordem: tipo i <tipo ii <tipo iii, facto atribuído à capacidade de adsorção mais elevada na vitrinite em comparação com outros
grupos de macerais.
neste sentido e levando a cabo uma observação minuciosa nos modelos cinéticos e, principalmente, nos factores de adsorção (w)
propostos pela versão mais recente do software petromod®12 (tipo i, w = 0,80, tipo ii w = 0,75 e tipo iii w = 0,68), encontrou-se uma
discrepância em relação à literatura citada por chalmers e bustin (2008) e por zhang et al. (2012). neste contexto, foram retomados os
resultados de adsorção/dessorção de gás obtidos na presente investigação para o cálculo do fator de adsorção (w) e, assim, construir e
propor um novo modelo cinético aplicável na simulação do software petromod®, considerando a adsorção de hidrocarbonetos produzidos.
o novo modelo de cinética permitiu propor um ajustamento à modelagem geoquímica da bacia de sabinas, levando, ao mesmo tempo, a
cabo uma comparação do efeito e da influencia dos factores de adsorção no momento da geração e expulsão de hidrocarbonetos. este
modelo cinético pelo factor de adsorção (w) é importante uma vez que leva em conta a quantidade de hidrocarbonetos adsorvidos na
rocha geradora, factor este que induz, claramente, o controlo do comportamento não-convencional da rocha geradora produzindo, assim,
uma variação no balanço da expulsão de hidrocarbonetos do cerogénio.
os resultados obtidos a partir da metodologia, as análises efectuadas e a construção do modelo cinético utilizado nesta pesquisa permitiu
estabelecer uma série de novas contribuições relativamente ao cerogénio da bacia de sabinas, a saber:
1.- para a adsorção/dessorção de gás, foram estudadas as variáveis físico-químicas que afectam a capacidade de adsorção de gás nas
amostras de carvão e deshale gas (rang/maturação, composição maceral e conteúdo em matéria mineral). com base nos resultados das
análises de petrografia orgânica foi possível observar e verificar que há uma maior capacidade de adsorção de metano em amostras de
carvão, quando o rang/maturação aumenta. o conteúdo em vitrinite é outro parâmetro importante em termos de capacidade de
armazenamento de gás quando comparado com outros grupos de macerais, devido a sua estrutura microporosa. nesta investigação,
verificou-se que a quantidade de gás adsorvido aumenta com o aumento do teor em vitrinite; sendo que as curvas de adsorção de gás
com valores mais baixos ocorrem em amostras com conteúdos mais elevados em inertinite. verificou-se, também, que o aumento do teor
em matéria mineral conduz à diminuição na capacidade de adsorção de gás pelo carvão.
2 - por outro lado, o novo modelo cinético proposto neste trabalho e a sua implementação no processo de simulação da bacia de
sabinas, permitiu um realinhamento no balanço de expulsão dos hidrocarbonetos da rocha geradora. para, realmente, conhecer o efeito
do modelo cinético durante o processo de simulação, realizou-se uma análise comparada do modelo cinético com o factor de adsorção
(w) = 0,92, proposto neste trabalho, com o mesmo modelo cinético utilizando o factor de adsorção (w) = 0,68 como parâmetro padrão
proposto no software petromod®12 para cerogénio tipo iii. foi, assim, possível observar as mudanças verificadas as quais indicam que o
modelo é altamente sensível ao factor de adsorção (w) no momento da expulsão dos hidrocarbonetos. isto, obviamente, induz mudanças
na expectativa de migração de hidrocarbonetos e do enchimento de reservatórios, tal como demonstrado no presente trabalho.the main objective of this research was to study the gas adsorption/desorption properties in unconventional reservoirs located in the
north-eastern mexico. first, a literature review concerning gas exploration was carried out, about the research works in sabinas basin and
chihuahua basin (camacho-ortegón 2009, de la o burrola, 2013), and to understand the behavior of unconventional reservoirs. the
work conducted by this authors include models that describes the thermomechanical history of the sabinas basin, the geological events
that define the behavior of the petroleum system, the evolution and the relationship with hydrocarbon generation.
the servicio geológico mexicano (sgm)performeda sampling campaign in 2012.for the characterization, the sgm providing us 50
samples divided between the sabinas basin and the chihuahua basin. the general characterization included: (1) immediate or primary
moisture and ash analysis (2) elemental analysis for (c, h, o, n, and s) quantification, (3) petrographic analysis for organic matter type
determination, (4) rock-eval®6 pyrolysis, for oil potential generation determination. after results evaluation, 10 samples were selected,
divided between the study basins, in order to develop adsorption/desorption tests and to understand of parameters affecting the adsorption
process.
in the sabinas basinwere observed storage capacities of methane gas between 202.11 scf/ton (7.07m3/ton) and 364.76 scf/ton
(10.47m3/ton), whereas in the chihuahua basin lower capacities of sorption were measured, within a range of 0.84 scf/ton (0.023m3/ton) to
3.48 scf/ton (0.084m3/ton). the adsorption/desorption tests results, let us to identify the physical and chemical characteristics of the
samples influencing the gas storage capacity in the kerogen. a general conclusion is given; the gas adsorption increases with the
rank/maturity. also, the influence of the maceral composition in the process of sorption is recognized, andthe capacity of gas storage is
closely related to the vitrinite content. according to chalmers y bustin (2008), and zhang et al.(2012), the capacity of adsorption as toc,
increases in the next order: type i < type ii < type iii. this is attributed tohighadsorption capacity of vitrinite, compared with other macerals
types.
a review of the kinetic models was conducted, the adsorption factors (w) mainly,recently proposed inthe last version of the software
petromod®12 (type i, w=0.80), (type ii w=0.75) and (type iii w=0.68). compared with the bibliography reported by (chalmers y bustin,
2008; zhang et al., 2012), a discrepancy was found. the adsorption/desorption gas results were applied to make the adsorption factor (w)
calculation, in order to build and to recommend a new kinetic model applicable to the software petromod®simulation process, for the
hydrocarbons generation, taking in consideration the adsorption.
the geochemical modelling of the sabinas basin was recalibrated with the new kinetic model, comparing at the same time the effect and
the influence of the adsorption factors at the moment of the hydrocarbons generation and expulsion. the factor (w) of the kinetic model is
relevant, because takes in consideration the adsorbed hydrocarbons quantity into the source rock.this factor evidently induces the
behavior of unconventional character for the source rock; a change into the hydrocarbons expulsion balance from the kerogen is produced.

prospección del gas, retomando trabajos de investigación ya existentes para la cuenca de sabinas y la cuenca de chihuahua (camacho
ortegón 2009, de la o burrola, 2013), con el fin de comprender su comportamiento desde el punto de vista de los yacimientos no
convencionales.los trabajos de estos autores incluyen modelos que describen la historia termomecánica de la cuenca de sabinas, los
eventos geológicos que definen el comportamiento del sistema petrolero, su evolución y su relación con la generación de hidrocarburos.
para continuar con el desarrollo de este proyecto, se llevó a cabo una campaña de muestreo a cargo del servicio geológico mexicano
(sgm), el cual nos proporcionó un total de 50 muestras divididas entre las cuencas de sabinas y chihuahua, para su caracterización. la
caracterización general incluyó: (1) análisis inmediatos o primarios de humedad y ceniza, (2) análisis elemental para la determinación de
(c, h, o, n, y s), (3) análisis petrográfico para determinar el tipo de materia orgánica, (4) pirolisis rock-eval®6 para conocer su potencial
petrolífero. el conjunto de estos análisis nos permitieron evaluar y seleccionar 10 muestras divididas entre las cuencas de estudio, para
desarrollar los ensayos de adsorción/desorción y la interpretación de los parámetros que influyen en el proceso de adsorción.
para la cuenca de sabinas, se observaron capacidades de almacenamiento de gas metano de 202.11 scf/ton (7.07m3/ton) a 364.76
scf/ton (10.47m3/ton), mientras que en la cuenca de chihuahua se presentaron capacidades de sorción más bajas, con un rango de 0.84
scf/ton (0.023m3/ton) a 3.48 scf/ton (0.084m3/ton). estos resultados nos permitieron interpretar las características físicas y químicas que
influyen en la capacidad de almacenamiento del gas en el kerógeno. anticipando como conclusión general que: la adsorción del gas
aumenta con el rango/madurez. también se estudio la influencia de la composición maceral en el proceso de sorción y se verificó que la
capacidad de almacenamiento de gas está íntimamente relacionada al contenido de vitrinita. esto nos condujó a retomar las
declaraciones de algunos autores (chalmers y bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012) quienes verificaron que la capacidad de adsorción en
base al cot aumenta en el siguiente orden: tipo i < tipo ii < tipo iii. esto se atribuyó a que la vitrinita tiene una mayor capacidad de
adsorción, en comparación con otros tipos de macerales.
en este sentido se llevó a cabo una minuciosa observación a los modelos cinéticos y principalmente en los factores de adsorción (w)
propuestos por la versión más reciente del software petromod®12 (tipo i, w=0.80), (tipo ii w=0.75) y (tipo iii w=0.68).se encontró una
discrepancia respecto a la bibliografía reportada por (chalmers y bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012). por lo que se retomaron los resultados
de adsorción/desorción de gas de esta investigación para realizar el cálculo del factor (w), para construir y proponer un nuevo modelo
cinético aplicable al proceso simulación del software petromod®, tomando en cuenta la adsorción.
el nuevo modelo cinético nos permitió proponer un reajuste al modelado geoquímico de la cuenca de sabinas, realizando al mismo
tiempo una comparación del efecto de los factores de adsorción en el momento de la generación y expulsión de hidrocarburos. este
modelo cinético por medio del factor (w), toma en cuenta la cantidad de hidrocarburos adsorbidos en la roca generadora, induciendo un
comportamiento de carácter no convencional para la roca generadora, produciendo así un cambio en el balance de expulsión de
hidrocarburos del kerógeno.
los resultados obtenidos a partir de los análisis implementados y la construcción del modelo cinético aplicado en la presente
investigación, permitieron establecer una serie de aportaciones nuevas para los kerógenos de la cuenca de sabinas, la cuales se pueden
dividir principalmente en dos partes.
1.- para la adsorción/desorción de gas, se estudiaron las variables físico-químicas que afectan a la capacidad de sorción de gas en
muestras de carbón y shale gas (madurez/rango, composición maceral y contenido de materia mineral). con base en los resultados del
análisis de petrografía orgánica fue posible observar y verificar que existe una mayor capacidad de sorción de metano en las muestras de
carbón cuando el rango/madurez aumenta. el contenido de vitrinita es otro parámetro importante en términos de capacidad de
almacenamiento gas al ser comparado con los otros macerales, debido a su estructura microporosa. en esta investigación se pudo
verificar que la cantidad de gas adsorbido se incrementa con el aumento del contenido de vitrinita, por el contrario, se producen curvas
más bajas de adsorción de gas en muestras con un mayor contenido de inertinita. también se verificó que el incremento del contenido de
materia mineral implica una disminución en la capacidad de sorción de gas en el carbón.
2.- por otra parte el nuevo modelo cinético propuesto en este trabajo y su implementación en el proceso de simulación de la cuenca de
sabinas, permitió realizar un reajuste en el balance de expulsión de hidrocarburos en la roca generadora. para conocer el efecto del
modelo cinético durante el proceso de simulación, se realizó un análisis comparativo entre el modelo cinético con un factor (w) =0.92
propuesto para este trabajo, respecto al mismo modelo cinético utilizando un factor (w) = 0.68 como parámetro estándar propuesto por el
software petromod®12para el kerógeno tipo iii.esto nos permitió observar las variaciones generadas a partir de su aplicación, las cuales
nos indican que el modelo es altamente sensible al factor (w), ya que induce cambios en la expectativa de la migración de hidrocarburos
y carga de los almacenes.l'objectif principal de cette recherche a été de réaliser une étude des propriétés d'adsorption/désorption du gaz dans les réservoirs non
conventionnels situés dans la partie nord-est du mexique. nous avons commencée par un revue de la littérature concernant a l'exploration
de gaz, reprenant des recherches existantes sur le bassin de sabinas et le bassin de chihuahua (camacho-ortegón 2009, de la o
burrola, 2013) afin de comprendre leur comportement du point de vue de réservoirs non conventionnels. ces auteurs proposent des
modèles qui décrivent l'histoire thermomécanique du bassin de sabinas, des événements géologiques qui définissent le comportement du
système pétrolier, son évolution et sa relation avec la production d'hydrocarbures.
nous avons réalisé une campagne d'échantillonnage en collaboration avec le servicio geológico mexicano (sgm) au mexique. ils nous
ont proposé un total de 50 échantillons répartis entre le bassin de sabinas et chihuahua pour leur caractérisation. cette caractérisation
générale inclus: (1) analyse immédiate ou primaire de l'humidité et de cendre (2) analyse élémentaire pour déterminer (c, h, o, n, et s),
(3) analyse pétrographique pour déterminer le type de matière organique (4) pyrolyse rock-eval®6 afin de connaître son potentiel
pétrolier. toutes ces analyses nous ont permis de sélectionner 10 échantillons entre les deux bassins de l'étude, afin de développer nous
essais d‘expérimentation d'adsorption/désorption de gaz et interpréter ainsi par les courbes de langmuir les paramètres affectant le
processus d'adsorption du ch4 et co2.
pour le bassin de sabinas, ont été mesurés des capacités de stockage de gaz méthane à partir de 202.11 scf/tonne (7.07 m3/tonne) à
364,76 scf/tonne (10.47 m3/tonne), alors que pour le bassin du chihuahua les capacités de sorption sont plus faibles, variant de 0,84
scf/tonne (0.023 m3/tonne) à 3,48 scf/tonne (0.084 m3/tonne). ces résultats nous ont permis d'apporter une interprétation des
caractéristiques physiques et chimiques qui influent sur la capacité de stockage de gaz dans le kérogène des roches sédimentaires de
type shale gas. nous avons trouvé que dans les bassins étudies l'adsorption de gaz augmente avec le rang/maturité des matières
organiques sédimentaires. nous avons également étudiée l'influence de la composition macérale sur les processus de sorption et nous
avons vérifié que la capacité de stockage de gaz, est étroitement liée à la teneur en vitrinite. cela nous conduit à prendre en considération
les publications de certains auteurs (chalmers et bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012) qui ont vérifié dans leurs travaux que les augmentations
de la capacité d'adsorption sur la base du cot sont dans l'ordre suivant: le type i <type ii <type iii. cela a été attribué à la capacité
d'adsorption précoce de la vitrinite par rapport aux autres types de macéraux.
à cet égard, en effectuant une observation approfondie sur les modèles cinétiques principalement sur les facteurs d'adsorption (w)
proposé par la dernière version du logiciel petromod®12 (type i, w = 0,80), (type ii w = 0,75) et (type iii w = 0,68), a été constaté un
écart par rapport à la littérature rapporté par (chalmers et bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012). nous avons pris en compte en conséquence
nous résultats de gaz d'adsorption/désorption pour effectuer le calcul du facteur (w) et construire et proposer un nouveau modèle
cinétique pour nous bassins avec la simulation du software petromod®, en prenant en compte l'adsorption.
le nouveau modèle cinétique nous a permis de proposer un re-ajustement et optimisation à la modélisation géochimique du bassin de
sabinas, et réaliser ainsi au même temps une comparaison de l'effet des facteurs d'adsorption au moment de la production
d'hydrocarbures et de l'expulsion. ce modèle cinétique avec le nouveau factor (w), prend en compte la quantité d'hydrocarbures
adsorbés par les matières organiques de la roche avec un comportement pétrolier non conventionnel, que se traduit par des variations
importantes dans bilan d'expulsion des hydrocarbures du kérogène.
les résultats obtenus a partir de l'analyse et la construction d'un modèle cinétique appliquée dans notre étude a permis d'établir un certain
nombre de nouvelles informations sur le comportement cinétique du kérogène du bassin sabinas, lesquelles peuvent être divisés
principalement en deux parties.
1. les propriétés d'adsorption/désorption de gaz, les plus importantes qui affectant la capacité de sorption de gaz des échantillons de
charbon et de shale gas sont : maturité/rang, composition macérale et le contenu de la matière minérale. ces résultats de l'analyse
pétrographique montrent en particulier une capacité de sorption élevée de méthane dans des échantillons de charbon lorsque le %prv
augmente. la teneur en vitrinite est également un paramètre important en termes de capacité de stockage de gaz par rapport aux autres
macéraux, en raison de sa structure microporeuse. dans cette étude, il a été constaté que la quantité de gaz adsorbée qui augmente avec
la teneur en vitrinite, peut diminuer aussi avec des teneurs en inertinite élevées. finalement l'augmentation de la teneur en matière
minérale produit aussi une diminution de la capacité de sorption de gaz dans le charbon.
2. le nouveau modèle cinétique proposé dans notre recherche a permis un réalignement dans le bilan de l'expulsion des hydrocarbures
des roches mères de nous bassins. l‘analyse comparative de la cinétique du modèle avec un facteur (w) = 0,92 proposé par les
résultats de notre étude et celui proposé par le même modèle cinétique standard utilisant un facteur (w) = 0,68 proposée par le logiciel
petromod®12 pour le kérogène du type iii, nous a permis d'observer des variations importantes de genèse et migration du pétrole lors du
remplissage des roches réservoirs conventionnelles.o principal objetivo desta pesquisa é o estudo das propriedades de adsorção/dessorção de gás em reservatórios não-convencionais
localizados na zina nordeste do méxico. para isso, foi previamente realizada uma revisão da literatura sobre exploração de gás
retomando trabalhos de investigação já existentes da bacia de sabinas e da bacia de chihuahua (camacho-ortegón, 2009; de la o
burrola, 2013) a fim de compreender o seu comportamento do ponto de vista dos reservatórios não-convencionais. as obras desses
autores incluem modelos que descrevem a história termomecânica da bacia de sabinas, eventos geológicos que definem o
comportamento do sistema petrolífero, a sua evolução e a sua relação com a geração de hidrocarbonetos.
no decurso do desenvolvimento deste projeto, foi efectuada uma campanha de amostragem pelo servicio geologico mexicano (sgm),
fornecendo um total de 50 amostras para caracterização, divididas entre as bacias de sabinas e de chihuahua. a classificação geral
inclui: (1) análise imediata ou primária de humidade e cinzas, (2) análise elementar para a determinação de c, h, o, n e s, (3) análise
petrográfica para determinação do tipo de matéria orgânica, (4) pirólise por rock-eval 6, para conhecer o potencial petrolífero. este
conjunto de análises permitiu avaliar e selecionar 10 amostras, divididas entre as bacias em estudo, para efectuar os ensaios de
adsorção/dessorção de gas e interpretar os parâmetros que afectam o processo de adsorção.
para a bacia sabinas, foram observadas capacidades de armazenamento de gás metano entre 202,11 scf/ton (7.07m3/ton) e 364,76
scf/ton (10.47m3/ton), enquanto que para a bacia chihuahua as capacidades de adsorção são mais baixas, variando entre 0,84 scf/ton
(0.023m3/ton) e 3,48 scf/ton (0.084m3/ton). estes resultados permitiram fazer a interpretação das características físicas e químicas que
influenciam na capacidade da armazenamento de gás no cerogénio. antecipando como uma conclusão geral, a adsorção de gás aumenta
com o rang/maturação. também se estudou a influência da composição maceral sobre o processo de adsorção verificando-se que a
capacidade de armazenamento de gás está intimamente relacionado com o conteúdo em vitrinite, o que levou a retomar os resultados de
alguns autores (chalmers e bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012) que verificaram que a capacidade de adsorção com base no toc aumenta
na seguinte ordem: tipo i <tipo ii <tipo iii, facto atribuído à capacidade de adsorção mais elevada na vitrinite em comparação com outros
grupos de macerais.
neste sentido e levando a cabo uma observação minuciosa nos modelos cinéticos e, principalmente, nos factores de adsorção (w)
propostos pela versão mais recente do software petromod®12 (tipo i, w = 0,80, tipo ii w = 0,75 e tipo iii w = 0,68), encontrou-se uma
discrepância em relação à literatura citada por chalmers e bustin (2008) e por zhang et al. (2012). neste contexto, foram retomados os
resultados de adsorção/dessorção de gás obtidos na presente investigação para o cálculo do fator de adsorção (w) e, assim, construir e
propor um novo modelo cinético aplicável na simulação do software petromod®, considerando a adsorção de hidrocarbonetos produzidos.
o novo modelo de cinética permitiu propor um ajustamento à modelagem geoquímica da bacia de sabinas, levando, ao mesmo tempo, a
cabo uma comparação do efeito e da influencia dos factores de adsorção no momento da geração e expulsão de hidrocarbonetos. este
modelo cinético pelo factor de adsorção (w) é importante uma vez que leva em conta a quantidade de hidrocarbonetos adsorvidos na
rocha geradora, factor este que induz, claramente, o controlo do comportamento não-convencional da rocha geradora produzindo, assim,
uma variação no balanço da expulsão de hidrocarbonetos do cerogénio.
os resultados obtidos a partir da metodologia, as análises efectuadas e a construção do modelo cinético utilizado nesta pesquisa permitiu
estabelecer uma série de novas contribuições relativamente ao cerogénio da bacia de sabinas, a saber:
1.- para a adsorção/dessorção de gás, foram estudadas as variáveis físico-químicas que afectam a capacidade de adsorção de gás nas
amostras de carvão e deshale gas (rang/maturação, composição maceral e conteúdo em matéria mineral). com base nos resultados das
análises de petrografia orgânica foi possível observar e verificar que há uma maior capacidade de adsorção de metano em amostras de
carvão, quando o rang/maturação aumenta. o conteúdo em vitrinite é outro parâmetro importante em termos de capacidade de
armazenamento de gás quando comparado com outros grupos de macerais, devido a sua estrutura microporosa. nesta investigação,
verificou-se que a quantidade de gás adsorvido aumenta com o aumento do teor em vitrinite; sendo que as curvas de adsorção de gás
com valores mais baixos ocorrem em amostras com conteúdos mais elevados em inertinite. verificou-se, também, que o aumento do teor
em matéria mineral conduz à diminuição na capacidade de adsorção de gás pelo carvão.
2 - por outro lado, o novo modelo cinético proposto neste trabalho e a sua implementação no processo de simulação da bacia de
sabinas, permitiu um realinhamento no balanço de expulsão dos hidrocarbonetos da rocha geradora. para, realmente, conhecer o efeito
do modelo cinético durante o processo de simulação, realizou-se uma análise comparada do modelo cinético com o factor de adsorção
(w) = 0,92, proposto neste trabalho, com o mesmo modelo cinético utilizando o factor de adsorção (w) = 0,68 como parâmetro padrão
proposto no software petromod®12 para cerogénio tipo iii. foi, assim, possível observar as mudanças verificadas as quais indicam que o
modelo é altamente sensível ao factor de adsorção (w) no momento da expulsão dos hidrocarbonetos. isto, obviamente, induz mudanças
na expectativa de migração de hidrocarbonetos e do enchimento de reservatórios, tal como demonstrado no presente trabalho.the main objective of this research was to study the gas adsorption/desorption properties in unconventional reservoirs located in the
north-eastern mexico. first, a literature review concerning gas exploration was carried out, about the research works in sabinas basin and
chihuahua basin (camacho-ortegón 2009, de la o burrola, 2013), and to understand the behavior of unconventional reservoirs. the
work conducted by this authors include models that describes the thermomechanical history of the sabinas basin, the geological events
that define the behavior of the petroleum system, the evolution and the relationship with hydrocarbon generation.
the servicio geológico mexicano (sgm)performeda sampling campaign in 2012.for the characterization, the sgm providing us 50
samples divided between the sabinas basin and the chihuahua basin. the general characterization included: (1) immediate or primary
moisture and ash analysis (2) elemental analysis for (c, h, o, n, and s) quantification, (3) petrographic analysis for organic matter type
determination, (4) rock-eval®6 pyrolysis, for oil potential generation determination. after results evaluation, 10 samples were selected,
divided between the study basins, in order to develop adsorption/desorption tests and to understand of parameters affecting the adsorption
process.
in the sabinas basinwere observed storage capacities of methane gas between 202.11 scf/ton (7.07m3/ton) and 364.76 scf/ton
(10.47m3/ton), whereas in the chihuahua basin lower capacities of sorption were measured, within a range of 0.84 scf/ton (0.023m3/ton) to
3.48 scf/ton (0.084m3/ton). the adsorption/desorption tests results, let us to identify the physical and chemical characteristics of the
samples influencing the gas storage capacity in the kerogen. a general conclusion is given; the gas adsorption increases with the
rank/maturity. also, the influence of the maceral composition in the process of sorption is recognized, andthe capacity of gas storage is
closely related to the vitrinite content. according to chalmers y bustin (2008), and zhang et al.(2012), the capacity of adsorption as toc,
increases in the next order: type i < type ii < type iii. this is attributed tohighadsorption capacity of vitrinite, compared with other macerals
types.
a review of the kinetic models was conducted, the adsorption factors (w) mainly,recently proposed inthe last version of the software
petromod®12 (type i, w=0.80), (type ii w=0.75) and (type iii w=0.68). compared with the bibliography reported by (chalmers y bustin,
2008; zhang et al., 2012), a discrepancy was found. the adsorption/desorption gas results were applied to make the adsorption factor (w)
calculation, in order to build and to recommend a new kinetic model applicable to the software petromod®simulation process, for the
hydrocarbons generation, taking in consideration the adsorption.
the geochemical modelling of the sabinas basin was recalibrated with the new kinetic model, comparing at the same time the effect and
the influence of the adsorption factors at the moment of the hydrocarbons generation and expulsion. the factor (w) of the kinetic model is
relevant, because takes in consideration the adsorbed hydrocarbons quantity into the source rock.this factor evidently induces the
behavior of unconventional character for the source rock; a change into the hydrocarbons expulsion balance from the kerogen is produced.
new contributions for sabinas basin kerogens were established with the obtained results of the methodology, and kinetic the model
construction used in this research, and they can be divided in two parts:
1.-for the gas adsorption/desorption, the physical-chemical variables affecting the ability of sorption gas in coal and shale gas samples

569,18712207,,['oai:etheses.whiterose.ac.uk:9725'],,thesis,"designing and implementing the reduced emissions from avoided deforestation and forest degradation (redd+) depend on mutually interlinked actors, policies and socioeconomic factors across global, national and local levels. unpacking the interaction between redd+ design and implementation processes could holistically identify sources of institutional impediments to the programme’s effectiveness in the context of sustainable development.  this thesis examines the process of designing redd+ rules at the global level and the implementation of these rules at the national and local levels in kenya. the study develops and applies an integrated institutions and development analytical framework (idaf) within which iterative document analysis, quantitative vulnerability indexing, project inventories and interviews are applied to gather empirical evidence. 



results reveal that multilevel institutional impediments face redd+ design and implementation. at the global level, resource endowment determines actors’ ability to design and implement methodological, financial and safeguard design rules for redd+. however, due to resource limitation and reliance on redd+ funds, the input of african states into the technical and institutional redd+ design  is weak. this creates gaps in technical capacity and funding required for implementing the global rules at the national level. in kenya, the national implementation relies on expertise and funds from multilateral intermediaries but this support plays into national institutional gaps e.g. path dependency and sectoral competition for funds to create implementation deficits. efforts to avoid ‘institutional complexities’ in delivering carbon funds confine redd+ activities within the state-based forestry sector but exclude key land use sectors such as lands and agriculture. this sectorial exclusion subdues cross-sectorial expertise required for redd+ implementation but most importantly, fails to attend to underlying drivers of deforestation such as resettlement and agricultural mechanisation.  



even though delivery of carbon and associated funds are emphasised at the global/national levels, local level implementation of the kasigau project relies more on delivery of pro-poor livelihoods that keep the poor out of forests. benefit sharing mechanism with regards to livelihoods is a key source of interplay between redd+ design and on-ground implementation but this interplay is a source of certain institutional conflicts: first, the interplay complicates multilevel institutional arrangements for redd+. for supporting local livelihood needs, the local community favourably perceives the private actor implementing the kasigau project but negatively perceives state regimes that have historically monopolised local resource decisions and benefits. this raises concerns as to whether the state, as the legitimate representative of local communities’ interests in redd+, can ably do so as expected by the unfccc. second, the interplay elicits carbon-livelihood tension. projects avoid investing/implementation within poor communities whose livelihood status could complicate delivery of carbon funds. projects target relatively richer areas endowed with humid forest resources at 0.728; p<0.01, land title deeds at 0.552; p<0.01 and better access to water at 0.475; p<0.01. this raises concerns about emission leakage when deforestation shifts to forests hosted in poorer communities. carbon-livelihood tension also renders equitable and pro-poor strategies in redd+ ineffective. strict carbon standards limit trade-offs between pro-poor livelihoods and forest protection especially when fluctuating carbon prices constrain funds needed for project operations and local livelihoods. 



this study presents one of the first multilevel scientific analyses of redd+ and contributes empirical evidence to literature on redd+ governance. it reveals that the main sources of redd+ implementation deficits emanate from the global and national institutional processes. as such, ensuring equity and rights in redd+ implementation is necessary but not sufficient for effective redd+ implementation unless national level institutions are reformed and global carbon conditions and pricing harmonised with local livelihood needs",university of leeds,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/139'],"[{'name': 'Atela, Joanes Odiwuor'}]",redd+ institutional design and implementation within local socioeconomic settings: evidence from kenya,2015,,

cinético aplicable al proceso simulación del software petromod®, tomando en cuenta la adsorción.
el nuevo modelo cinético nos permitió proponer un reajuste al modelado geoquímico de la cuenca de sabinas, realizando al mismo
tiempo una comparación del efecto de los factores de adsorción en el momento de la generación y expulsión de hidrocarburos. este
modelo cinético por medio del factor (w), toma en cuenta la cantidad de hidrocarburos adsorbidos en la roca generadora, induciendo un
comportamiento de carácter no convencional para la roca generadora, produciendo así un cambio en el balance de expulsión de
hidrocarburos del kerógeno.
los resultados obtenidos a partir de los análisis implementados y la construcción del modelo cinético aplicado en la presente
investigación, permitieron establecer una serie de aportaciones nuevas para los kerógenos de la cuenca de sabinas, la cuales se pueden
dividir principalmente en dos partes.
1.- para la adsorción/desorción de gas, se estudiaron las variables físico-químicas que afectan a la capacidad de sorción de gas en
muestras de carbón y shale gas (madurez/rango, composición maceral y contenido de materia mineral). con base en los resultados del
análisis de petrografía orgánica fue posible observar y verificar que existe una mayor capacidad de sorción de metano en las muestras de
carbón cuando el rango/madurez aumenta. el contenido de vitrinita es otro parámetro importante en términos de capacidad de
almacenamiento gas al ser comparado con los otros macerales, debido a su estructura microporosa. en esta investigación se pudo
verificar que la cantidad de gas adsorbido se incrementa con el aumento del contenido de vitrinita, por el contrario, se producen curvas
más bajas de adsorción de gas en muestras con un mayor contenido de inertinita. también se verificó que el incremento del contenido de
materia mineral implica una disminución en la capacidad de sorción de gas en el carbón.
2.- por otra parte el nuevo modelo cinético propuesto en este trabajo y su implementación en el proceso de simulación de la cuenca de
sabinas, permitió realizar un reajuste en el balance de expulsión de hidrocarburos en la roca generadora. para conocer el efecto del
modelo cinético durante el proceso de simulación, se realizó un análisis comparativo entre el modelo cinético con un factor (w) =0.92
propuesto para este trabajo, respecto al mismo modelo cinético utilizando un factor (w) = 0.68 como parámetro estándar propuesto por el
software petromod®12para el kerógeno tipo iii.esto nos permitió observar las variaciones generadas a partir de su aplicación, las cuales
nos indican que el modelo es altamente sensible al factor (w), ya que induce cambios en la expectativa de la migración de hidrocarburos
y carga de los almacenes.l'objectif principal de cette recherche a été de réaliser une étude des propriétés d'adsorption/désorption du gaz dans les réservoirs non
conventionnels situés dans la partie nord-est du mexique. nous avons commencée par un revue de la littérature concernant a l'exploration
de gaz, reprenant des recherches existantes sur le bassin de sabinas et le bassin de chihuahua (camacho-ortegón 2009, de la o
burrola, 2013) afin de comprendre leur comportement du point de vue de réservoirs non conventionnels. ces auteurs proposent des
modèles qui décrivent l'histoire thermomécanique du bassin de sabinas, des événements géologiques qui définissent le comportement du
système pétrolier, son évolution et sa relation avec la production d'hydrocarbures.
nous avons réalisé une campagne d'échantillonnage en collaboration avec le servicio geológico mexicano (sgm) au mexique. ils nous
ont proposé un total de 50 échantillons répartis entre le bassin de sabinas et chihuahua pour leur caractérisation. cette caractérisation
générale inclus: (1) analyse immédiate ou primaire de l'humidité et de cendre (2) analyse élémentaire pour déterminer (c, h, o, n, et s),
(3) analyse pétrographique pour déterminer le type de matière organique (4) pyrolyse rock-eval®6 afin de connaître son potentiel
pétrolier. toutes ces analyses nous ont permis de sélectionner 10 échantillons entre les deux bassins de l'étude, afin de développer nous
essais d‘expérimentation d'adsorption/désorption de gaz et interpréter ainsi par les courbes de langmuir les paramètres affectant le
processus d'adsorption du ch4 et co2.
pour le bassin de sabinas, ont été mesurés des capacités de stockage de gaz méthane à partir de 202.11 scf/tonne (7.07 m3/tonne) à
364,76 scf/tonne (10.47 m3/tonne), alors que pour le bassin du chihuahua les capacités de sorption sont plus faibles, variant de 0,84
scf/tonne (0.023 m3/tonne) à 3,48 scf/tonne (0.084 m3/tonne). ces résultats nous ont permis d'apporter une interprétation des
caractéristiques physiques et chimiques qui influent sur la capacité de stockage de gaz dans le kérogène des roches sédimentaires de
type shale gas. nous avons trouvé que dans les bassins étudies l'adsorption de gaz augmente avec le rang/maturité des matières
organiques sédimentaires. nous avons également étudiée l'influence de la composition macérale sur les processus de sorption et nous
avons vérifié que la capacité de stockage de gaz, est étroitement liée à la teneur en vitrinite. cela nous conduit à prendre en considération
les publications de certains auteurs (chalmers et bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012) qui ont vérifié dans leurs travaux que les augmentations
de la capacité d'adsorption sur la base du cot sont dans l'ordre suivant: le type i <type ii <type iii. cela a été attribué à la capacité
d'adsorption précoce de la vitrinite par rapport aux autres types de macéraux.
à cet égard, en effectuant une observation approfondie sur les modèles cinétiques principalement sur les facteurs d'adsorption (w)
proposé par la dernière version du logiciel petromod®12 (type i, w = 0,80), (type ii w = 0,75) et (type iii w = 0,68), a été constaté un
écart par rapport à la littérature rapporté par (chalmers et bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012). nous avons pris en compte en conséquence
nous résultats de gaz d'adsorption/désorption pour effectuer le calcul du facteur (w) et construire et proposer un nouveau modèle
cinétique pour nous bassins avec la simulation du software petromod®, en prenant en compte l'adsorption.
le nouveau modèle cinétique nous a permis de proposer un re-ajustement et optimisation à la modélisation géochimique du bassin de
sabinas, et réaliser ainsi au même temps une comparaison de l'effet des facteurs d'adsorption au moment de la production
d'hydrocarbures et de l'expulsion. ce modèle cinétique avec le nouveau factor (w), prend en compte la quantité d'hydrocarbures
adsorbés par les matières organiques de la roche avec un comportement pétrolier non conventionnel, que se traduit par des variations
importantes dans bilan d'expulsion des hydrocarbures du kérogène.
les résultats obtenus a partir de l'analyse et la construction d'un modèle cinétique appliquée dans notre étude a permis d'établir un certain
nombre de nouvelles informations sur le comportement cinétique du kérogène du bassin sabinas, lesquelles peuvent être divisés
principalement en deux parties.
1. les propriétés d'adsorption/désorption de gaz, les plus importantes qui affectant la capacité de sorption de gaz des échantillons de
charbon et de shale gas sont : maturité/rang, composition macérale et le contenu de la matière minérale. ces résultats de l'analyse
pétrographique montrent en particulier une capacité de sorption élevée de méthane dans des échantillons de charbon lorsque le %prv
augmente. la teneur en vitrinite est également un paramètre important en termes de capacité de stockage de gaz par rapport aux autres
macéraux, en raison de sa structure microporeuse. dans cette étude, il a été constaté que la quantité de gaz adsorbée qui augmente avec
la teneur en vitrinite, peut diminuer aussi avec des teneurs en inertinite élevées. finalement l'augmentation de la teneur en matière
minérale produit aussi une diminution de la capacité de sorption de gaz dans le charbon.
2. le nouveau modèle cinétique proposé dans notre recherche a permis un réalignement dans le bilan de l'expulsion des hydrocarbures
des roches mères de nous bassins. l‘analyse comparative de la cinétique du modèle avec un facteur (w) = 0,92 proposé par les
résultats de notre étude et celui proposé par le même modèle cinétique standard utilisant un facteur (w) = 0,68 proposée par le logiciel
petromod®12 pour le kérogène du type iii, nous a permis d'observer des variations importantes de genèse et migration du pétrole lors du
remplissage des roches réservoirs conventionnelles.o principal objetivo desta pesquisa é o estudo das propriedades de adsorção/dessorção de gás em reservatórios não-convencionais
localizados na zina nordeste do méxico. para isso, foi previamente realizada uma revisão da literatura sobre exploração de gás
retomando trabalhos de investigação já existentes da bacia de sabinas e da bacia de chihuahua (camacho-ortegón, 2009; de la o
burrola, 2013) a fim de compreender o seu comportamento do ponto de vista dos reservatórios não-convencionais. as obras desses
autores incluem modelos que descrevem a história termomecânica da bacia de sabinas, eventos geológicos que definem o
comportamento do sistema petrolífero, a sua evolução e a sua relação com a geração de hidrocarbonetos.
no decurso do desenvolvimento deste projeto, foi efectuada uma campanha de amostragem pelo servicio geologico mexicano (sgm),
fornecendo um total de 50 amostras para caracterização, divididas entre as bacias de sabinas e de chihuahua. a classificação geral
inclui: (1) análise imediata ou primária de humidade e cinzas, (2) análise elementar para a determinação de c, h, o, n e s, (3) análise
petrográfica para determinação do tipo de matéria orgânica, (4) pirólise por rock-eval 6, para conhecer o potencial petrolífero. este
conjunto de análises permitiu avaliar e selecionar 10 amostras, divididas entre as bacias em estudo, para efectuar os ensaios de
adsorção/dessorção de gas e interpretar os parâmetros que afectam o processo de adsorção.
para a bacia sabinas, foram observadas capacidades de armazenamento de gás metano entre 202,11 scf/ton (7.07m3/ton) e 364,76
scf/ton (10.47m3/ton), enquanto que para a bacia chihuahua as capacidades de adsorção são mais baixas, variando entre 0,84 scf/ton
(0.023m3/ton) e 3,48 scf/ton (0.084m3/ton). estes resultados permitiram fazer a interpretação das características físicas e químicas que
influenciam na capacidade da armazenamento de gás no cerogénio. antecipando como uma conclusão geral, a adsorção de gás aumenta
com o rang/maturação. também se estudou a influência da composição maceral sobre o processo de adsorção verificando-se que a
capacidade de armazenamento de gás está intimamente relacionado com o conteúdo em vitrinite, o que levou a retomar os resultados de
alguns autores (chalmers e bustin, 2008; zhang et al, 2012) que verificaram que a capacidade de adsorção com base no toc aumenta
na seguinte ordem: tipo i <tipo ii <tipo iii, facto atribuído à capacidade de adsorção mais elevada na vitrinite em comparação com outros
grupos de macerais.
neste sentido e levando a cabo uma observação minuciosa nos modelos cinéticos e, principalmente, nos factores de adsorção (w)
propostos pela versão mais recente do software petromod®12 (tipo i, w = 0,80, tipo ii w = 0,75 e tipo iii w = 0,68), encontrou-se uma
discrepância em relação à literatura citada por chalmers e bustin (2008) e por zhang et al. (2012). neste contexto, foram retomados os
resultados de adsorção/dessorção de gás obtidos na presente investigação para o cálculo do fator de adsorção (w) e, assim, construir e
propor um novo modelo cinético aplicável na simulação do software petromod®, considerando a adsorção de hidrocarbonetos produzidos.
o novo modelo de cinética permitiu propor um ajustamento à modelagem geoquímica da bacia de sabinas, levando, ao mesmo tempo, a
cabo uma comparação do efeito e da influencia dos factores de adsorção no momento da geração e expulsão de hidrocarbonetos. este
modelo cinético pelo factor de adsorção (w) é importante uma vez que leva em conta a quantidade de hidrocarbonetos adsorvidos na
rocha geradora, factor este que induz, claramente, o controlo do comportamento não-convencional da rocha geradora produzindo, assim,
uma variação no balanço da expulsão de hidrocarbonetos do cerogénio.
os resultados obtidos a partir da metodologia, as análises efectuadas e a construção do modelo cinético utilizado nesta pesquisa permitiu
estabelecer uma série de novas contribuições relativamente ao cerogénio da bacia de sabinas, a saber:
1.- para a adsorção/dessorção de gás, foram estudadas as variáveis físico-químicas que afectam a capacidade de adsorção de gás nas
amostras de carvão e deshale gas (rang/maturação, composição maceral e conteúdo em matéria mineral). com base nos resultados das
análises de petrografia orgânica foi possível observar e verificar que há uma maior capacidade de adsorção de metano em amostras de
carvão, quando o rang/maturação aumenta. o conteúdo em vitrinite é outro parâmetro importante em termos de capacidade de
armazenamento de gás quando comparado com outros grupos de macerais, devido a sua estrutura microporosa. nesta investigação,
verificou-se que a quantidade de gás adsorvido aumenta com o aumento do teor em vitrinite; sendo que as curvas de adsorção de gás
com valores mais baixos ocorrem em amostras com conteúdos mais elevados em inertinite. verificou-se, também, que o aumento do teor
em matéria mineral conduz à diminuição na capacidade de adsorção de gás pelo carvão.
2 - por outro lado, o novo modelo cinético proposto neste trabalho e a sua implementação no processo de simulação da bacia de
sabinas, permitiu um realinhamento no balanço de expulsão dos hidrocarbonetos da rocha geradora. para, realmente, conhecer o efeito
do modelo cinético durante o processo de simulação, realizou-se uma análise comparada do modelo cinético com o factor de adsorção
(w) = 0,92, proposto neste trabalho, com o mesmo modelo cinético utilizando o factor de adsorção (w) = 0,68 como parâmetro padrão
proposto no software petromod®12 para cerogénio tipo iii. foi, assim, possível observar as mudanças verificadas as quais indicam que o
modelo é altamente sensível ao factor de adsorção (w) no momento da expulsão dos hidrocarbonetos. isto, obviamente, induz mudanças
na expectativa de migração de hidrocarbonetos e do enchimento de reservatórios, tal como demonstrado no presente trabalho.the main objective of this research was to study the gas adsorption/desorption properties in unconventional reservoirs located in the
north-eastern mexico. first, a literature review concerning gas exploration was carried out, about the research works in sabinas basin and
chihuahua basin (camacho-ortegón 2009, de la o burrola, 2013), and to understand the behavior of unconventional reservoirs. the
work conducted by this authors include models that describes the thermomechanical history of the sabinas basin, the geological events
that define the behavior of the petroleum system, the evolution and the relationship with hydrocarbon generation.
the servicio geológico mexicano (sgm)performeda sampling campaign in 2012.for the characterization, the sgm providing us 50
samples divided between the sabinas basin and the chihuahua basin. the general characterization included: (1) immediate or primary
moisture and ash analysis (2) elemental analysis for (c, h, o, n, and s) quantification, (3) petrographic analysis for organic matter type
determination, (4) rock-eval®6 pyrolysis, for oil potential generation determination. after results evaluation, 10 samples were selected,
divided between the study basins, in order to develop adsorption/desorption tests and to understand of parameters affecting the adsorption
process.
in the sabinas basinwere observed storage capacities of methane gas between 202.11 scf/ton (7.07m3/ton) and 364.76 scf/ton
(10.47m3/ton), whereas in the chihuahua basin lower capacities of sorption were measured, within a range of 0.84 scf/ton (0.023m3/ton) to
3.48 scf/ton (0.084m3/ton). the adsorption/desorption tests results, let us to identify the physical and chemical characteristics of the
samples influencing the gas storage capacity in the kerogen. a general conclusion is given; the gas adsorption increases with the
rank/maturity. also, the influence of the maceral composition in the process of sorption is recognized, andthe capacity of gas storage is
closely related to the vitrinite content. according to chalmers y bustin (2008), and zhang et al.(2012), the capacity of adsorption as toc,
increases in the next order: type i < type ii < type iii. this is attributed tohighadsorption capacity of vitrinite, compared with other macerals
types.
a review of the kinetic models was conducted, the adsorption factors (w) mainly,recently proposed inthe last version of the software
petromod®12 (type i, w=0.80), (type ii w=0.75) and (type iii w=0.68). compared with the bibliography reported by (chalmers y bustin,
2008; zhang et al., 2012), a discrepancy was found. the adsorption/desorption gas results were applied to make the adsorption factor (w)
calculation, in order to build and to recommend a new kinetic model applicable to the software petromod®simulation process, for the
hydrocarbons generation, taking in consideration the adsorption.
the geochemical modelling of the sabinas basin was recalibrated with the new kinetic model, comparing at the same time the effect and
the influence of the adsorption factors at the moment of the hydrocarbons generation and expulsion. the factor (w) of the kinetic model is
relevant, because takes in consideration the adsorbed hydrocarbons quantity into the source rock.this factor evidently induces the
behavior of unconventional character for the source rock; a change into the hydrocarbons expulsion balance from the kerogen is produced.
new contributions for sabinas basin kerogens were established with the obtained results of the methodology, and kinetic the model
construction used in this research, and they can be divided in two parts:
1.-for the gas adsorption/desorption, the physical-chemical variables affecting the ability of sorption gas in coal and shale gas samples
(maturity/range, maceral composition and mineral matter content), were studied.with the",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1132'],"[{'name': 'Enciso Cárdenas, Juan Josué'}]",estudio de las propiedades de adsorción – desorción de gases en los sistemas petroleros no convencionales en méxico y su aplicacion al modelo cinético de generación de hidrocarburos,2015,,

il primo capitolo di questa tesi descrive il contesto di più ampio respiro in cui questo lavoro è incluso. questo studio è infatti parte integrante di due progetti di ricerca condotti a livello nazionale per indagare il potenziale geotermico del centro e del sud italia (progetto vigor e progetto atlante geotermico del mezzogiorno).

nel secondo capitolo dell’elaborato è invece proposta una sintesi dei concetti chiave utilizzati nell’ambito delle scienze sociali per l’analisi dell’accettabilità sociale delle energie rinnovabili e per l’elaborazione di nuove policy destinate all’innovazione: fiducia, rischio, place-attachment, responsible research and innovation e public engagement with science.

il cuore di questa ricerca è presentato nei capitoli 3 e 4. per indagare l’attitudine e i punti di vista dei cittadini rispetto alle tecnologie geotermiche ho condotto due casi studio: il primo (capitolo 3) nella provincia di palermo (sicilia), il secondo (capitolo 4) nella provincia di viterbo (lazio). per stabilire l’accettabilità sociale dell’energia geotermica nelle aree selezionate, ho utilizzato sia metodi di indagine qualitativa (focus group), sia metodi di indagine quantitativa (questionari).

alla luce dei risultati che ho ottenuto da questi due casi studio, le conclusioni sono presentate nel capitolo 5. dopo alcuni richiami alla letteratura, il capitolo presenta alcune riflessioni conclusive derivanti da un’analisi comparativa dei due casi studio: i risultati ottenuti nelle aree di indagine presentano infatti alcune peculiarità che confermano la forte relazione, già confermata in letteratura, tra l’accettabilità sociale e il concetto di place-attachment. sulla base di questi risultati, la tesi si conclude con alcuni suggerimenti di buone pratiche orientate a garantire la partecipazione pubblica, col fine ultimo di coinvolgere tutti gli attori sociali coinvolti nell’innovazione tecnologica in ogni fase del processo di innovazione stessa: dalle prime valutazioni in termini di priorità di ricerca e di strategia su larga scala, fino allo sviluppo di singoli progetti sul territorio.italy was the first country to exploit geothermal resources for energy production, already back in 1904, and ranks fifth in the world for geothermal power production. despite the extraordinary potential of the italian geothermal resource, there appears to be little knowledge or understanding of this opportunity and its implications for the general society. however, several literature studies show that the lack of public engagement in the innovation process may be a constraining factor for  eventual increase the share of renewables and that social acceptance of new technologies should be included in research programs.

in the first chapter of this thesis i describe the research framework in which this work is included. the research is part of two national research projects assessing the geothermal resources of central and southern italy (progetto vigor and progetto atlante geotermico del mezzogiorno).

in the second chapter of this thesis i describe the key concept adopted by recent line of social sciences scholarship in order to analyze the social acceptance of renewables and to elaborate new innovation policy: trust, risk perception and communication, place-attachment, responsible research and innovation and public engagement with science. 

the core of the research is presented in chapter 3 and 4. to explore attitudes and public views towards geothermal energy technologies, we conducted two case studies: the first (chapter 3) in the palermo province (sicily) and the second (chapter 4) in the viterbo province (central italy). in order to assess social acceptance of geothermal energy in the selected areas, we used a mix of qualitative (focus groups) and quantitative methods (survey). 

in the light of the outcomes of these two case studies, i present the overall conclusions in chapter 5. after some literature remarks, an overall comparative reasoning on the findings of my research is given: beside some general similarities, the two case studies show significant peculiarities that confirm the strong relation existing between social acceptance and place-related meanings. based on these findings, i conclude the thesis by suggesting some good practices oriented towards public engagement in order to include all relevant actors at every phase of the innovation process, from the very early stage (i.e. identification of priorities, social needs and future visions at a large scale level) to the development of single innovation projects (i.e. facilities siting and plants development at local level)",università degli studi di milano,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1107'],[{'name': 'A.

this thesis presents the development of a cost effective and compact tubular manifold microchannel heat and mass exchanger (mmhx) for industrial applications. a novel design for the flow distribution manifolds has been proposed. the proposed manifold helps in the enhancement of heat and mass transfer by creating better flow mixing. the mmhx is designed in such a way that the manifold causes the flow to break into multiple passes of very short flow lengths in the microchannels. these flow lengths are short enough such that the flow in the channels is always into entry zone (developing laminar zone) both hydrodynamically as well as thermally, resulting in higher heat transfer than that in the fully developed laminar flow in conventional microchannel heat exchangers. the pressure drop in the device is low as the fluid flow length into the microchannels is very short.

while the manifold design helps in flow distribution, very short flow length inside the microchannels mitigates the problems of flow instability of two-phase heat transfer applications such as that in evaporators and condensers. the mass transfer in gas liquid reaction applications is enhanced due to the multiple passes where continuous breaking of the gas liquid interface as well as mixing of the bulk liquid occurs.

a multi-pass microchannel heat and mass exchanger prototype was designed, fabricated and was experimentally tested for the performance as liquid-liquid heat exchanger, evaporator, condenser and gas- liquid absorber. experiments were carried out by changing the liquid and gas flow rates, geometry of the microchannels and the size of the manifold. flow visualization studies were also performed to study two phase flow distribution and flow pattern in the manifold.

experimental results have shown that the mass transfer coefficient (using co2 and dea-water solution) for the microchannel absorber is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the conventional absorber. this increase in mass transfer is mainly attributed to high interfacial area to volume ratio of microchannels and good mixing in the manifold. similarly, heat transfer coefficient for the single phase heat transfer as well as for two phase heat transfer (evaporator and condenser) is about 3 to 8 times higher than the conventional heat exchangers such as shell and tube or plate type heat exchanger. high transfer rates enable us to design compact heat and mass transfer devices for the industrial applications. industrial processes, such as carbon capture, which are not economically viable due to their high cost, can be feasible with the development of these next generation heat and mass transfer equipment. due to the simplicity of the component design and the assembly, cost of the industrial scale equipment can be substantially lower as compared other compact heat exchangers.

current work is the continuation of heat and mass transfer work being carried out at the s2ts lab in university of maryland. while jha v.(2012) studied the first version of single pass manifold microchannel heat exchanger, ganapathy h. (2014) studied the absorption of co2 in dea solution in single microchannel as well as in parallel microchannels. mmhx studied in this study builds on the previous work by introducing the multipass concept and utilizing commercially available fin tubes as microchannel surfaces",wiley,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1304'],"[{'name': 'Tiwari, Ratnesh'}]",process intensification by utilizing multistage manifold microchannel heat and mass exchangers,2015,,

three eras of nuclear power development form the foci of the research. firstly, an examination of the ‘forgotten inquiry’ between 1988-1989 into the construction of hinkley c nuclear power station, which was never built due to the collapse of the economic case for nuclear due to privatisation. through archival research and interviews, this chapter traces empirically how ‘political opportunities’ were enacted and created by campaign groups within the inquiry setting, and how various spatial strategies were utilised to politicise the inquiry. the second empirical chapter addresses the participatory era of new labour, where new collaborative experiments were developed to negotiate nuclear issues. through analysis of policy documents and interview data, the ways in which the enthusiasm towards participatory governance was problematised through the return of new nuclear power onto the policy agenda is explored, with particular attention to ‘object-focussed’ state theory. thirdly, the effects of the ‘rescaled’ consultative framework of the planning act are explored through interviews, policy documents, and ethnographic research. situated within the context of the second attempt to construct hinkley c, this chapter provides fertile ground for comparative analysis with the 1980’s inquiry.
i argue that the act attempts to solve some of the key tensions of previous policy, attempting to speed up the planning process whilst maintaining commitments to collaborative forms of public engagement through consensus-based decision-making. the spatial framing of the act is seen as key to processes of post-politicisation however, where substantial concerns regarding the profound uncertainties of the uk nuclear revival are displaced to other forms of engagement beyond planning. this attempt to ‘solve political dissensus through space’ has ‘unintended consequences’ however which are explored in the conclusion. this thesis brings empirical attention to the’ where’ of politics in different policy settings. theoretical discussions regarding the relationship between spatial politics, and more nuanced understandings of post-politics and the political are developed through this thesis","geography department, university of sao paulo",['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/504'],"[{'name': 'Johnstone, Philip Calum Jamil'}]",from inquiry to consultation: contested spaces of public engagement with nuclear power,2015,,

trees incorporate co₂ from the local atmosphere into their annual growth rings. measurements of ¹⁴c in polluted and clean air trees were compared to the baring head δ¹⁴co₂ atmospheric record. as co₂ff emissions are devoid of ¹⁴c addition of co₂ff will cause a decrease in ¹⁴c directly related to the amount of co₂ff present.

trees growing immediately downwind of the vector plant and from clean air locations in taranaki and baring head wellington, were cored and cut into one year growth increments. two cellulose preparation methods were tested to confirm effectiveness at removing mobile extractive components and lignin. radiocarbon and stable isotope results showed that the ansto method was more effective than the rafter method. the clean air trees compare well with the baring head atmospheric record whereas trees growing downwind of the vector plant demonstrate lower ¹⁴c content consistent with co₂ff addition. historic co₂ff emissions were reconstructed for the polluted trees, with 1–3ppm of co₂ff in the luscombe chestnut tree and 4–7 ppm co₂ff in the vector pine tree. co₂ff observations were compared with reported emissions from the vector and ballance plants. observed co₂ff increased by 10% in the vector pine tree for the period 1994–2012 relative to pre-1994 levels, whereas combined co₂ff emissions increased by 64%. no increase was observed in the luscombe chestnut tree for the same time period. meteorological analysis was performed to assess the relative contribution of co₂ff from the sources to the trees. it is proposed that the trend observed in the vector pine is due to the dominance of emissions from the ballance plant and a relatively minor contribution from the vector plant",victoria university of wellington library,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1003'],"[{'name': 'Norris, Margaret'}]",reconstruction of historic fossil co₂ emissions using radiocarbon measurements from tree rings,2015,,

this thesis presents the development of a cost effective and compact tubular manifold microchannel heat and mass exchanger (mmhx) for industrial applications. a novel design for the flow distribution manifolds has been proposed. the proposed manifold helps in the enhancement of heat and mass transfer by creating better flow mixing. the mmhx is designed in such a way that the manifold causes the flow to break into multiple passes of very short flow lengths in the microchannels. these flow lengths are short enough such that the flow in the channels is always into entry zone (developing laminar zone) both hydrodynamically as well as thermally, resulting in higher heat transfer than that in the fully developed laminar flow in conventional microchannel heat exchangers. the pressure drop in the device is low as the fluid flow length into the microchannels is very short.

while the manifold design helps in flow distribution, very short flow length inside the microchannels mitigates the problems of flow instability of two-phase heat transfer applications such as that in evaporators and condensers. the mass transfer in gas liquid reaction applications is enhanced due to the multiple passes where continuous breaking of the gas liquid interface as well as mixing of the bulk liquid occurs.

a multi-pass microchannel heat and mass exchanger prototype was designed, fabricated and was experimentally tested for the performance as liquid-liquid heat exchanger, evaporator, condenser and gas- liquid absorber. experiments were carried out by changing the liquid and gas flow rates, geometry of the microchannels and the size of the manifold. flow visualization studies were also performed to study two phase flow distribution and flow pattern in the manifold.

experimental results have shown that the mass transfer coefficient (using co2 and dea-water solution) for the microchannel absorber is 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than the conventional absorber. this increase in mass transfer is mainly attributed to high interfacial area to volume ratio of microchannels and good mixing in the manifold. similarly, heat transfer coefficient for the single phase heat transfer as well as for two phase heat transfer (evaporator and condenser) is about 3 to 8 times higher than the conventional heat exchangers such as shell and tube or plate type heat exchanger. high transfer rates enable us to design compact heat and mass transfer devices for the industrial applications. industrial processes, such as carbon capture, which are not economically viable due to their high cost, can be feasible with the development of these next generation heat and mass transfer equipment. due to the simplicity of the component design and the assembly, cost of the industrial scale equipment can be substantially lower as compared other compact heat exchangers.

current work is the continuation of heat and mass transfer work being carried out at the s2ts lab in university of maryland. while jha v.(2012) studied the first version of single pass manifold microchannel heat exchanger, ganapathy h.

593,34375494,,['oai:archive.ugent.be:5916186'],,thesis,"methane is the most important organic greenhouse gas emitted to the atmosphere for its contribution to the global warming. the gas has a strong infrared absorbance (i.e., 25 times more efficiently than carbon dioxide) which makes it a more effective greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide although having a shorter lifetime in the atmosphere (~9 years). driven by the anthropogenic emission due to the increase of global population and energy demand, methane emission is set to increase in the future. several anthropogenic methane emission mitigation has been applied in various sectors (agriculture, energy, and waste). the use of a biochemical reactor can be an alternative to remediate methane emission at low concentration (< 1 % (v/v)) as it environmentally friendly and economically more beneficial. in the biochemical oxidizer, methane oxidizing bacteria (mob) are used as the biocatalyst. mob are part of methylotrophic bacteria, a group of bacteria capable of utilizing one carbon compounds as their carbon and energy sources. for gaseous waste having low solubility like methane, the typical bioreactor used to treat methane gas waste is biofilter where mob are immobilized on a carrier material.
when designing a biofilter, carrier material selection is arguably the most crucial step. the preferred carrier materials possess a high porosity and surface area to provide space for the bacteria to grow and to increase the contact area between the bacteria and methane, respectively. based on these criteria, building materials have the potential to be a good carrier material for a methane biofilter. using this concept of “housing” mob on building material, another biotechnological application of the bacteria was explored. microbiologically induced carbonate precipitation (micp) is the production of carbonate mineral driven by environmental condition (e.g., ph) alteration as a result of microbial activity. in the construction industry, the typically applied urea hydrolysis based micp poses several disadvantages such as ammonia release to the air and nitric acid production. in this thesis, the capacity of mob to induce calcium carbonate precipitation as the basis for a more environmentally friendly biogenic building material surface protection was also explored. therefore the thesis is divided into two parts: part 1 deals with the exploration of building material utilization as the carrier material for methane biofiltration (chapter 2 to 4) whereas part 2 deals with the exploration of mob application on building materials as an alternative biocatalyst for the material surface treatment (chapter 5 and 6).
in chapter 2 a screening of different building material and mob culture was done to select the combination of both which allow the bacteria to exhibit the highest methane removal capacity. experiments were performed with different mob inoculated on building materials at high (~20 % (v/v)) and low (~100 ppmv) methane concentrations. methylocystis parvus in autoclaved aerated concrete (aac) exhibited the highest methane removal rate at high (28.5 ± 3.8 μg ch4 g-1 building material h-1) and low (1.7 ± 0.4 μg ch4 g-1 building material h-1) methane concentration. due to the higher volume of pores with diameter > 5 μm compared to other materials tested, aac was able to adsorb more bacteria which might explain for the higher methane removal observed. the total methane and carbon dioxide-carbon in the headspace was decreased for 65.2 ± 10.9 % when m. parvus in aac was incubated for 100 hours. aac was therefore selected for the carrier material for the subsequent methane bioremediation studies (chapter 3 and 4) and m. parvus was selected as the mob strains for micp studies (chapter 5 and 6).
in chapter 3, the methane removal capacity of mixed mob culture in a biofilter setup using aac as a highly porous carrier material was tested. although it was found that m. parvus exhibited the highest methane removal capacity on aac (chapter 2), mixed mob culture was the selected culture for the biofilter inoculation in this study. this was based on the fact that non-aseptic practice was preferred to keep the operating cost lower if the biofilter was to be applied to remove methane in places with high methane emission (atmospheric concentration < 1 % (v/v)). batch experiment was performed to optimize mob immobilization on the aac specimens where optimum methane removal was obtained when calcium chloride was not added during bacterial inoculation step and 10 mm thick aac specimens were used. the immobilized mob could remove methane at low methane concentration (~1000 ppmv) in a biofilter setup for 127 days at an average removal efficiency (re) of 28.7%. mob also exhibited a higher abundance at the bottom of the filter, in proximity with the methane gas inlet where a high methane concentration was found. it was concluded here that a reasonably efficient and a more environmentally friendly methane biofilter performance can be obtained using aac as the carrier material. hence, the setup was used in a field test application (chapter 4).
the performance of mob immobilized on aac to remove methane from ruminants effluent gas was investigated in chapter 4. a biofilter employed in chapter 3 was used as the biofilter in this study. two dairy cows were housed in respiration chambers for two days where the exhaust gas from the chambers was used as the biofilter feed. mob consumed methane at an average re of 17.52 % and elimination capacity (ec) of 67.3 g m-3 d-1. several factors that might cause the lower re and ec compared to the lab scale study (re = 28.7 %) in chapter 3 are: (a) the lower methane concentration and (b) the presence of ammonia in the livestock effluent gas, (c) the higher gas flow rate into the biofilter, and (d) the lowering humidity level in the biofilter. by using aac as carrier material, carbon dioxide in the effluent gas as well as the one from the methane oxidation by mob were removed by the carbonation reaction with aac. thus, complete carbon sequestration from methane was obtained. overall, in part 1 of this thesis (chapter 2 to 4) it was concluded that a more environmentally friendly methane biofilter than the ones previously tested could be achieved when using acc as the carrier material.
an alternative micp from calcium formate by methylocystis parvus obbp is presented in chapter 5. to induce calcium carbonate precipitation, m. parvus was incubated at different calcium formate concentrations and starting culture densities. up to 91.4 % ± 1.6 % of the initial calcium was precipitated in the methane amended cultures compared to 35.1 % ± 11.9 % when methane was not added. because the bacteria could only utilize methane for growth, higher culture densities and therefore calcium removals were exhibited in the cultures when methane was added. a higher calcium carbonate precipitate yield was obtained when higher culture densities were used but not necessarily when more calcium formate was added. this was mainly due to salt inhibition of the bacterial activity at a high calcium formate concentration. a maximum of 0.67 ± 0.03 caco3 ca(chooh)2-1 (g/g) calcium carbonate precipitate yield was obtained when 109 cells ml-1 and 5 g l-1 of calcium formate were used. compared to the current strategy employing biogenic urea degradation as the basis for micp, the approach in this study presents significant improvements in terms of pollutant emission reduction if applied in the construction industry. the process was subsequently applied on building material as an alternative surface treatment (chapter 6).
the effectiveness of micp from the formate oxidation by methylocystis parvus as an alternative concrete surface treatment was investigated in chapter 6. micp was induced on aac by immersing the material in 109 m. parvus cells ml-1 containing 5 g l-1 of calcium formate. a 2 days immersion of the material gave the highest weight increase of the specimen due to the calcium carbonate deposition. the deposition mainly occurred on the wall of the pores on the surface of the specimen. due to this surface deposition, a significantly lower water absorption was observed in the bacterially treated specimens compared to the non-treated ones (i.e., up to 2.92 ± 0.91 kg m-2). a concomitant atmospheric methane removal (152.2 ± 40.1 μg of ch4 m-2 h-1) was also observed in the bacterially treated specimens. overall, in part 2 of this thesis (chapter 5 and 6) it was concluded that compared to the currently employed biogenic processes, the formate-based micp by m. parvus offers a more environmentally friendly approach for the biotechnological application to protect concrete surface. 
the results obtained from part 1 and 2 in this thesis were subsequently positioned in their related biotechnology field and the outlook for the respective researches was presented in chapter 7. the aac-based methane biofilter had lower methane removal efficiency compared to the previously reported biofilters, although the other biofilters operated with higher empty bed residence time (ebrt) which might increase the overall methane conversion in the biofilter. the aac-based methane biofilter, however, offers an advantage of carbon dioxide sequestration and this advantage is not found in the other biofilters. for the formate-oxidation based micp by m. parvus, it was found that, on per cell basis, the optimum biomineralization rate obtained in chapter 5 (i.e., at 5 g l-1 calcium formate and 109 cells ml-1) was still approximately three times lower than the maximum urea based biomineralization rate by b. pasteurii atcc 6453. moreover, unlike the urea-based micp where a high urea / calcium source concentration could be employed, the influence of the formate-oxidation based micp on the building material characteristics was smaller. nevertheless, the resulting calcium carbonate deposition could effectively lowered water intrusion into the material. based on the results obtained, several suggestions were made. to construct the biofilter like the “green façade” concept, mob should be applied by brushing / spraying on existing building material with consecutive applications of nutrient applications to sustain the mob growth on the building structure. for the mob-based micp, the application on natural stones to test the effectiveness of the process as the surface treatment for this type of material should be performed. future studies should also look into the use of mixed culture mob as it may lower the cost of this type of application",ghent university. faculty of bioscience engineering,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1493'],"[{'name': 'Ganendra, Giovanni'}]",housing methane-oxidizing bacteria on building materials : towards a sustainable air bioremediation and building materials surface protection,2015,,

the main thermodynamic parameters, which describe the plant operation during transient conditions, is the base point to identify the most stressed plant devices.

being fundamental the role played by combined cycle power plants in the liberalized electricity market scenario, a combined cycle power plant is selected as test case. the dynamic model of a single pressure combined cycle power unit is built and the proposed procedure is tested. the results show that the procedure can be considered as a valuable innovative tool to assist power plant designers and operators in order to improve the plant’s ﬂexibility without excessively compromising the integrity of devices subjected to high thermo-mechanical stresses.

(fig. s; iii). therefore, insitu doc concentrations in close proximity to dictyota sp. were investigated along a natural lightgradient from 5 to 20 m depth. additionally, the change in doc concentration near dictyota sp.was determined from 9:00 till 18:00 hrs at 11 m depth and compared to diurnal changes in lightavailability. elevated doc concentrations near dictyota sp. were only observed at 10 m, but notat 5 and 20 m depth. moreover, doc accumulated in the vicinity of dictyota sp. relative tobackground concentrations during the course of the experiment. these findings suggest that lightdrivendoc release is an important factor in the occurrence of diurnal and depth-related variationsin doc concentrations near dictyota sp. relative to concentrations in the overlying water column.however, other factors, such as photoinhibition and water exchange also need to be taken intoaccount to adequately explain the occurrence of elevated doc concentrations.while several studies also reported a positive effect of light availability on the doc release ofaquatic primary producers (e.g., fogg 1983; wood and van valen 1990; cherrier et al. 2014),others did not find such a relationship (e.g., bjørnsen 1988; marañón et al. 2004; marañón et al.2005). this discrepancy could be based on the presence of two different doc release mechanisms:i) a light-dependent mechanism, where doc is actively released in an overflow mechanism, andii) a light-independent mechanism, where doc passively diffuses through the cell membrane.these two mechanisms are certainly not mutually exclusive and varying environmental factors(e.g., nutrient availability) are proposed to determine which mechanism dominates (carlson 2002;borchard and engel 2015). incubation experiments with turf algae were performed to test theinteractive effects of light and nutrient availability on doc release (fig. s; iv). turf algae wereexposed to two light levels (full and reduced light) and two nutrient treatments (natural seawaterand enriched seawater). doc release by turf algae increased with increasing light availability undernaturally occurring nutrient concentrations. addition of nutrients resulted in the disappearance ofthe positive relationship with light availability. doc release rates in these nutrient repletetreatments were comparable at full and at reduced light levels. these results indicate that low lightin combination with low nutrient availability reduces the release of doc by caribbean turf algaeand that light and nutrient availability simultaneously and interactively affected this release.bcms are becoming more abundant on coral reefs worldwide and dominate the benthiccommunities on some reefs. despite the high abundance, their contribution to the local doc poolis virtually unknown. doc and oxygen fluxes of bcms were determined in situ using benthicchambers and compared to those of other benthic primary producers (fig. s; v). bcms releasedapproximately 16% of their photosynthetically fixed carbon as doc. however, doc release atnight was more than twice that high. this doc release in the dark is proposed to be the result ofincomplete organic matter degradation and fermentation under anoxic conditions. whenintegrating the doc release in light and dark conditions over a 24 hrs diurnal cycle at the studysite on curaçao, bcms (benthic cover: 24%) were estimated to release four times more doc thanmacroalgae and turf algae combined (benthic cover: 17 and 19%, respectively). bcms therebydisplay the highest contribution to the benthic doc production (80%).coral-excavating sponges are the most important bioeroders on caribbean reefs. if they, similar toother non-excavating sponges, can directly feed on doc, they may benefit from an increase indoc production due to ongoing coral-algal phase shifts. therefore, the potential doc andbacterial uptake of the common excavating sponges siphonodictyon sp. and cliona delitrix wereinvestigated in situ (fig. s; vi). despite bacterial retention efficiencies of 72 and 87% forsiphonodictyon sp. and c. delitrix, respectively, both species relied mainly on the uptake of docto meet their carbon demand (82 and 76%, respectively). this utilization of doc indicates thatexcavating sponges might i) benefit from an increase in dom production as result of coral-algalphase shifts and ii) may also participate in the sponge loop.in conclusion, the work in this thesis has shown that under natural nutrient conditions (nutrientlimitation), light availability positively affects the doc release of reef algae. yet, also otherfactors, such as photoinhibition due to excessive light and doc removal processes (e.g., waterexchange, diffusion and consumption by heterotrophic organisms) have to be taken into account tomake predictions about the occurrence of elevated doc concentrations in close proximity to reefalgae. next to the light-driven doc release under natural nutrient conditions, light-independentdoc release can occur in caribbean turf algae under nutrient replete conditions. thus, nutrientavailability might determine whether light-dependent or light-independent doc release prevailsand a third doc release mechanism was proposed that operates in bcms in the absence of light.lastly, the ability of coral-excavating sponges to use doc as food source suggests that they maybenefit from current coral-algal phase shifts and increases in bcms and could participate in thesponge loop.fig. s simplified scheme of dom dynamics on tropical coral reefs. roman numbers represent investigatedprocesses and corresponding chapters in this thesis. red arrows indicate competitive species interactions",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/956'],"[{'name': 'Mueller, B.'}]",shedding light on doc release by benthic primary producers and its consumption by bioeroding sponges,2015,,

e.u. to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and source a share of overall energy
consumption from renewable energy resources by 2020. with severe limitations in the
transport and heating sectors the onus is on the electricity sector to provide a significant
reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and introduce a substantial increase in renewable
energy production.
the most attractive renewable energy resources are located in the geographic extremes
of the country, far from the large population densities and high voltage, high capacity
transmission networks. this means that the majority of renewable generation
technologies will need to connect to the conventionally passive, lower voltage
distribution networks. the integration of distributed generation (dg) is severely
restricted by the technical limitations of the passively managed lower voltage
infrastructure. long lead times and the capital expenditure of traditional electricity
network reinforcement can significantly delay or make the economics of some
renewable generation schemes unviable. to be able to quickly and cost-effectively
integrate significant levels of dg, the conventional fit-and-forget approach will have to
be evolved into a ‘connect-and-manage’ system using active network management
(anm) techniques.
anm considers the real-time variation in generation and demand levels and schedules
electricity network control settings to alleviate system constraints and increase
connectable capacity of dg. this thesis explores the extent to which real time
adjustments to dg and network asset controller set-points could allow existing
networks to accommodate more dg.
this thesis investigates the use of a full ac opf technique to operate and schedule in
real time variables of anm control in distribution networks. these include; dg real and
reactive power output and on-load-tap-changing transformer set-points. new
formulations of the full ac opf problem including multi-objective functions,
penalising unnecessary deviation of variable control settings, and a receding-horizon
formulation are assessed.
this thesis also presents a methodology and modelling environment to explore the new
and innovative formulations of opf and to assess the interactions of various control
practices in real time.
continuous time sequential, single scenario, opf analyses at a very short control cycle
can lead to the discontinuous and unnecessary switching of network control set-points,
particularly during the less onerous network operating conditions. furthermore, residual
current flow and voltage variation can also gave rise to undesirable network effects
including over and under voltage excursion and thermal overloading of network
components. for the majority of instances, the magnitude of constraint violation was not
significant but the levels of occurrence gave occasional cause for concern. the new
formulations of the opf problem were successful in deterring any extreme and
unsatisfactory effects.
results have shown significant improvements in the energy yield from non-firm
renewable energy resources. initial testing of the real time opf techniques in a simple
demonstration network where voltage rise restricted the headroom for installed dg
capacity and energy yield, showed that the energy yield for a single dg increased by
200% from the fit-and-forget scenario. extrapolation of the opf technique to a network
with multiple dgs from different types of renewable energy resources showed an
increase of 216% from the fit-and-forget energy yield. in a much larger network case
study, where thermal loading limits constrained further dg capacity and energy yield,
the increase in energy yield was more modest with an average increase of 45% over the
fit-and-forget approach. in the large network where thermal overloading prevailed there
was no immediate alternative to real power curtailment.
this work has demonstrated that the proposed anm opf schemes can provide an
intelligent, more cost effective and quicker alternative to network upgrades. as a result,
dnos can have a better knowledge and understanding of the capabilities and technical
limitations of their networks to absorb dg safely and securely, without the expense of

co2-eor has inherent challenges due to the viscosity and density differences between reservoir fluids and the injected co2, potentially leading to poor sweep efficiency. poor sweep efficiency is detrimental to oil recovery and co2 storage. providing technological solutions that tackle the sweep efficiency issues can potentially make co2-eor feasible and catalyze the implementation of large-scale carbon capture and storage. foam is a technological solution that decreases the mobility of co2 and increases sweep efficiency. this thesis presents a multi-scale investigation of foam for co2 mobility control stabilized using non-ionic surfactants. the study includes investigations from pore-scale foam dynamics to field-scale implementation of co2-foam injection, with an emphasis to produce oil from mature field with a reduced carbon footprint.
the thesis consists of five chapters. chapter 1 provides an introduction and a rationale for the research questions addressed in this thesis, whereas chapter 2 provides a theoretical background of fundamental concepts of foam in porous media. chapter 3 summarizes the experimental methods and clarifies how the experiments relate to each other. chapter 4 presents key findings from the five publications, emphasizing synergetic results from published work, and is organized into individual foam-subjects.doktorgradsavhandlin",society of petroleum engineers (spe),['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2833'],"[{'name': 'Føyen, Tore Lyngås'}]",co2 foam using non-ionic surfactants : for increased storage capacity and oil recovery,2021,,

ein weiteres dilemma wird sichtbar, wenn man den wasserstress, der sich aus der zusätzlichen bewässerung ergäbe, mit dem in einer durch ungebremsten klimawandel um 3°c erwärmten welt ohne bioenergie vergleicht: in beiden szenarien könnte (im vergleich zu heute) der wasserstress bis zum ende des 21. jahrhunderts stark steigen. tatsächlich ergäbe sich im bioenergie-szenario aber sogar potenziell mehr wasserstress als im klimawandel-szenario. nachhaltiges wassermanagement als kombination aus wasserentnahmebeschränkungen gemäß den anforderungen von flussökosystemen und verbessertem wassermanagement auf agrarischen nutzflächen hätte das potenzial, diesen zusätzlichen wasserstress zu begrenzen, wäre jedoch auf globaler ebene schwierig zu etablieren.

a further dilemma is delineated by a comparison of the water stress resulting from the additional irrigation needed to limit climate change and the water stress in a 3°c warmer world without bioenergy.
in both scenarios, the global area and the number of people experiencing water stress would increase severely by the end of the 21st century. the bioenergy scenario shows even higher water stress than the case of unmitigated climate change. sustainable water management, as a combination of water withdrawal restrictions according to environmental flow requirements and improved on-field water management, has the potential to limit this additional water stress. but it would be a challenge to establish such strategies on a global scale.

methods: in this modelling study, we used shared socioeconomic pathway 2 with no climate policy as the reference scenario, and two representative carbon neutrality scenarios with identical emission trajectories and different technology pathways-one was led by renewable energies and the other was led by negative emission technologies. we had three modules to analyse health co-benefits and mitigation costs for each policy scenario. first, we used a computable general equilibrium model that captures the operation of the whole economic system to investigate the carbon mitigation costs and air pollutant emission pathways of different technology portfolios. second, we used a reduced complexity air quality model to estimate the concentrations of particulate matter in the atmosphere from the air pollutant emission pathways. finally, we used a health impact evaluation model to estimate premature deaths, morbidity, and the resulting loss of life expectancy, then these health impacts were monetised according to value of a statistical life and cost of illness. we compared the monetised health co-benefits against the corresponding mitigation costs to explore the cost-effectiveness of different technology portfolios. a series of uncertainties embodied in carbon neutrality pathways and models were considered.



findings: in our models, sole dependence on improving end-of-pipe air pollution control measures is not sufficient for all chinese provinces to meet the 2005 who pm2·5 standards (10 μg/m3) by 2060. only a combination of strong climate and air pollution control policies can lead to substantial improvement of air quality across china. if the carbon neutrality pathway led by developing renewable energies was followed, the air quality of all provinces could meet the who guideline by 2060. with the realisation of carbon neutrality goals, the total discounted mitigation costs (discount rate 5%) from 2020-60 would range from 40-125 trillion chinese yuan (cny), and 22-50 million cumulative premature deaths could be avoided. china has the potential to increase the associated life expectancy by 0·88-2·80 years per person in 2060 versus the reference scenario. the health benefits are higher in the renewable energies-led scenarios, whereas the mitigation costs are smaller in the negative emission technologies-led scenarios. if the value of a statistical life is set higher than 12·5 million cny (39% of the organisation for economic co-operation and development value), the health co-benefits will be higher than mitigation costs, even when considering all included uncertainties, implying the cost-effectiveness of china's carbon neutrality goal.



interpretation: the life expectancy increase from the realisation of china's 2060 carbon neutrality goal could be equivalent to the past 5-10 years of life expectancy growth in china. choosing an appropriate carbon neutrality pathway affects the health of china's population both today and in the future. our findings suggest that, if china incorporates health co-benefits into climate policy making and puts a high value on people's health, it should choose a carbon neutrality pathway that relies more on developing renewable energies and avoid over-reliance on negative emission technologies",elsevier bv,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/767'],"[{'name': 'Zhang, S.'}, {'name': 'An, K.'}, {'name': 'Li, J.'}, {'name': 'Weng, Y.'}, {'name': 'Zhang, S.'}, {'name': 'Wang, S.'}, {'name': 'Cai, W.'}, {'name': 'Wang, C.'}, {'name': 'Gong, P.'}]",incorporating health co-benefits into technology pathways to achieve china's 2060 carbon neutrality goal: a modelling study,2021,,

referred as ""power-to-gas-to-power (p2g2p)"" overlooks the cost-sharing and
emission benefits from using the deployed h$_2$ production and storage assets
to also supply h$_2$ for decarbonizing other end-use sectors where direct
electrification may be challenged. here, we develop a generalized modelling
framework for co-optimizing energy infrastructure investment and operation
across power and transportation sectors and the supply chains of electricity
and h$_2$, while accounting for spatio-temporal variations in energy demand and
supply. applying this sector-coupling framework to the u.s. northeast under a
range of technology cost and carbon price scenarios, we find a greater value of
power-to-h$_2$ (p2g) versus p2g2p routes. p2g provides flexible demand
response, while the extra cost and efficiency penalties of p2g2p routes make
the solution less attractive for grid balancing. the effects of sector-coupling
are significant, boosting vre generation by 12-55% with both increased
capacities and reduced curtailments and reducing the total system cost (or
levelized costs of energy) by 6-14% under 96% decarbonization scenarios. both
the cost savings and emission reductions from sector coupling increase with
h$_2$ demand for other end-uses, more than doubling for a 96% decarbonization
scenario as h$_2$ demand quadraples. moreover, we found that the deployment of
carbon capture and storage is more cost-effective in the h$_2$ sector because
of the lower cost and higher utilization rate. these findings highlight the

this thesis includes four individual case studies that all deal with different sustainability aspects and aim to measure, prioritize or communicate information about sustainability impacts of products and technologies. common aspects in the case studies include the use of analytic, quantitative research methods together with qualitative methods and data, and active stakeholder engagement. all case studies apply the principles of life cycle thinking, considering how the information created from the assessment should be communicated and used in order to minimize evaluated impacts or to prioritize future activities.

the results from this study indicate that sustainability assessment methods are useful for generating information and increasing knowledge about the studied system and related sustainability impacts. thus, they could be used to address some of the shortcomings related to lacking environmental information in sustainability management research. analytic methods are important for sustainability assessment, since their use makes it necessary to consider in detail all related issues (inputs, outputs, life cycle phases and actors along the life cycle). however, due to many choices that have to be made during the assessment, the results become (at least partly) socially constructed. this does not reduce the value of the assessments, but increases the need for transparency when communicating the results. in future, more discussion about social aspects related to knowledge production and interpretation in the context of analytic methods is encouraged.

sustainability assessment has been criticized for focusing too much on comparing existing alternatives, instead of considering if the evaluated options could really contribute to sustainability. in addition, the focus of the field has been on the development of more precise methods and tools, rather than considering, how the methods could be used to support decision-making. in future, management theories could be applied in the context of sustainability assessment to increase understanding about the change processes that are required for implementing assessed activities, and considering, how the results should be presented to managers and other stakeholders.

sustainability assessments may help in understanding the complexity that is related to sustainability, and identifying what needs to be changed or managed. however, both measuring and management require reductionism that makes complex issues easier to handle and to communicate. the study highlights how paradoxes and trade-offs are not only related to the concept of sustainability, but also on the many different methods that are applied for measuring it. measuring is necessary for understanding sustainability challenges, but measuring is not enough to make sustainability manageable. it is argued that many of the existing challenges related to sustainability management cannot be addressed simply by developing more efficient metrics, but rather by increasing the understanding of the assessment process, and the kind of information the assessments are able to produce.

practice-oriented transdisciplinary research provides a framework that allows combining methods and approaches that originate from different disciplinary practices. it acknowledges the paradoxes that are evident in both sustainability management and sustainability assessment. the study concludes that existing methods are useful for identifying trade-offs related to sustainability, but it is necessary to understand their limitations. simply looking at measurable aspects may provide too narrow understanding of many sustainability impacts, and may hide important interlinkages, trade-offs and rebound effects. by extending the scope of the assessment from purely quantitative to more qualitative means, it is possible to increase understanding of the studied problem. at the same time, information becomes more fragmented and less specific, and more difficult to communicate.  consequently, one of the main challenges in sustainability assessment relates to balancing between comprehensiveness and simplicity of produced information. the more comprehensive the assessment is, the more difficult it is to provide simple guidelines. yet many stakeholders would prefer to have simple guidelines about most sustainable options. it is proposed that future studies should focus on considering how organizations and individual decision-makers are able to use produced sustainability information for making more sustainable choices.jos sen voi mitata, voiko sitä voi myös johtaa? poikkitieteellinen tutkimus kestävän kehityksen arvioinnista ja johtamisesta

tutkimuksen tulokset osoittavat, että kestävän kehityksen arviointimenetelmät ovat hyödyllisiä kestävyystiedon tuottamisessa sekä tarkasteltavien tuotesysteemien että niiden aiheuttamien ympäristövaikutusten kuvaamisessa. näitä arviointimenetelmiä voitaisiin jatkossa hyödyntää enemmän myös johtamisen tutkimuksessa. arviointien avulla voitaisiin kerätä erityisesti organisaatioiden toimintaan liittyvää ympäristötietoa, jonka on osoitettu puuttuvan useista johtamisen alan tutkimuksista. analyyttisillä menetelmillä on tärkeä rooli kestävän kehityksen arvioinnissa, sillä niiden soveltaminen edellyttää kaikkien tuotesysteemiin kuuluvien tekijöiden selvittämistä ja tarkkaa läpikäyntiä. toisaalta arviointien suorittaminen edellyttää myös monenlaisten valintojen tekemistä. niiden seurauksena tuotettu tieto on (ainakin osittain) sosiaalisesti rakentunutta. tämä ei vähennä arviointien hyödyllisyyttä, mutta korostaa läpinäkyvyyden tarvetta tuloksia raportoitaessa. tutkimustiedon sosiaalisesta rakentumisesta tulisikin jatkossa keskustella entistä enemmän myös analyyttisten menetelmien yhteydessä.

kestävän kehityksen arviointia on kritisoitu keskittymisestä lähinnä arvioitujen vaihtoehtojen väliseen vertailuun kestävän kehityksen suoranaisen edistämisen sijaan. alan keskeisenä painopisteenä on ollut entistä tarkempien ja kokonaisvaltaisempien menetelmien ja mittareiden kehitys. tuotetun tiedon parempaan hyödyntämiseen ja viestintään erilaisissa päätöksentekotilanteissa on kiinnitetty huomattavasti vähemmän huomiota. tulevaisuudessa johtamisen teorioita voitaisiin hyödyntää arviointien yhteydessä erityisesti niiden muutosprosessien analysoinnissa, joita tutkittujen tuotteiden tai teknologioiden käyttöönotto edellyttäisi. lisäksi johtamisen näkökulmia voitaisiin hyödyntää, kun pohditaan, miten arviointitulokset olisi parasta esittää yritysjohtajille ja muille sidosryhmien edustajille.

parhaimmillaan arvioinnit auttavat tunnistamaan asioita, joita pitäisi yrittää muuttaa ja joiden johtamisen tulisi kiinnittää enemmän huomiota. sekä mittaaminen että johtaminen edellyttävät kuitenkin useita yksinkertaistuksia, jotta asioista tulisi helpommin käsiteltäviä ja viestittäviä. tärkeitä näkökulmia voi jäädä arviointien ulkopuolelle, jos kaikkia tarpeellisia tietoja ei syystä tai toisesta ole voitu sisällyttää laskelmiin. johtamisen näkökulmasta olisi siis olennaista ymmärtää, mitä voidaan mitata ja miten. mutta vähintään yhtä tärkeää olisi ymmärtää, mitä ei voida mitata ja miksi.
tutkimus osoittaa, että sen lisäksi, että kestävän kehityksen käsitteeseen liittyy erilaisia ristiriitoja ja jännitteitä, niitä liittyy myös sen mittaamiseen ja arviointiin. vaikutusten arviointi on välttämätöntä, jotta kestävyyshaasteita opittaisiin ymmärtämään paremmin, mutta mittaaminen ei vielä tarkoita, että kestävä kehitys olisi johdettavissa. tutkimus toteaa, että vaikka parempien mittareiden kehitystä on usein ehdotettu ratkaisuksi erilaisiin johtamisen haasteisiin, pelkkä mittareiden kehitys ei riitä ongelman ratkaisuksi. sen sijaan meidän tulisi kiinnittää entistä enemmän huomiota sekä siihen, miten arviointeja tehdään, että siihen, minkälaista tietoa arviointien avulla on mahdollista tuottaa.

tämän tutkimuksen perusteella käytännönläheinen poikkitieteellinen tutkimus mahdollistaa erilaisilta tieteenaloilta peräisin olevien menetelmien ja teorioiden yhdistelyn. se hyväksyy ristiriidat, joita liittyy sekä kestävän kehityksen johtamiseen että arviointiin. tutkimus toteaa, että olemassa olevat kestävän kehityksen arviointimenetelmät ovat hyödyllisiä ongelmakohtien ja ristiriitaisten valintatilanteiden tunnistamisessa, mutta on myös tärkeää ymmärtää menetelmiin sisältyvät rajoitteet. jos keskitymme pelkästään mitattavaan tietoon, tutkimustulokset voivat jäädä liian kapeiksi, jolloin tärkeitä riippuvuussuhteita, takaisinkytkentöjä ja tehtyjä kompromisseja voi jäädä huomaamatta. laajentamalla arviointeja puhtaasti mitattavista näkökulmista myös laadullisiin näkökulmiin voidaan saavuttaa kokonaisvaltaisempi käsitys tutkittavista ongelmista. samalla kuitenkin tuotetusta tiedosta tulee vähemmän tarkkaa ja vaikeammin viestittävää. usein arviointien tulosten toivotaan tuottavan selkeitä ja yksinkertaisia toimintaohjeita ja vaihtoehtoja. haasteeksi kuitenkin muodostuu se, että mitä kokonaisvaltaisemmin kestävää kehitystä pyritään arvioimaan, sitä vaikeampi arvioinnin perusteella on antaa yksiselitteisiä toimintaohjeita. jatkotutkimuksen tulisikin kiinnittää entistä enemmän huomiota siihen, miten yritykset ja yksittäiset päätöksentekijät voisivat paremmin ymmärtää ja hyödyntää arviointien avulla tuotettua tietoa","fi=turun yliopisto. turun kauppakorkeakoulu|en=university of turku, turku school of economics|",['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/5595'],"[{'name': 'Pihkola, Hanna'}]",what can be measured can be managed? : a transdisciplinary study in sustainability assessment and management,2021,,

inorganic carbon fixation in the ocean and are thus of immense importance for global co2 sequestration. this makes them good candidates for biological carbon capture and utilization (ccu) by mass cultivation using co2 emissions from industrial point sources. large scale cultivation of marine diatoms will produce valuable biomass containing marine lipids and proteins with possible commercial application. commercial production of biomass requires extensive knowledge on the species to be cultivated in terms of optimal cultivation conditions, but also on the bioactivity, cytotoxicity and how the species responds to changing cultivation conditions. most studies on the bioactivity and biochemistry of marine diatoms have been performed on species cultivated in the laboratory. cultivation conditions are known to affect the biochemistry of diatoms, and large-scale cultivation will inevitably lead to a change in the environmental conditions. the present study was therefore designed to investigate how porosira glacialis cultivated in large scale responds to changes in abiotic and biotic cultivation conditions. the first study was designed to investigate whether the direct addition of factory smoke as a source of co2 would trigger production of bioactive or cytotoxic compounds in p. glacialis. bioactivity testing revealed activity in anticancer, antibacterial and antibiofilm assays, in addition to cytotoxicity against human lung fibroblasts and effect on the development of sea urchin larvae. nonetheless, the addition of factory smoke did not increase the cytotoxicity of p. glacialis, nor did it change the beneficial antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. these results are favourable for further development of large-scale production of diatom biomass. p. glacialis was co-cultivated with zooplankton to investigate whether the bioactivity and metabolic expression of the diatom would change when exposed to grazing pressure. the bioactivity testing revealed that the presence of zooplankton increased the cytotoxicity of p. glacialis towards human normal lung fibroblasts. investigation of active compounds and metabolomic analysis showed that the grazing pressure possibly influence the carotenoid concentration in p. glacialis. it was also found that the bioactivity might be traced to primary metabolites such as chlorophyll derived compounds. the study also showed that the use of osmac (one strain many compounds) could be a useful method for further investigation of the bioactivity of diatoms. investigation of the antibiofilm activity of p. glacialis resulted in isolation of two compounds showing inhibition of biofilm formation by staphylococcus epidermidis. the compounds isolated were methyl 3-hydroxyoctadecanoate and a pheophorbide-like compound. this is the first time compounds with antibiofilm activity have been isolated from p. glacialis as well as the first evidence of such activity from both the isolated compounds.kiselalgene utgjør den største og viktigste gruppen av marine mikroalger. de er ansvarlige for en fjerdedel av all uorganisk karbonfiksering i havet og er dermed av enorm betydning for det globale co2 opptaket. dette gjør dem til gode kandidater for biologisk karbonfangst og -utnyttelse (ccu) i massedyrking ved bruk av co2 fra industrielle punktutslipp. storskala dyrking av marine kiselalger vil produsere verdifull biomasse som inneholder marine lipider og proteiner med mulig kommersiell anvendelse. kommersiell produksjon av biomasse krever stor kunnskap om arten som skal dyrkes med tanke på best mulige dyrkingsforhold, men også om bioaktivitet, toksisitet og hvordan arten reagerer på endrede dyrkingsforhold. de fleste studier på bioaktivitet og biokjemi av marine kiselalger er utført på arter dyrket i laboratoriet. det er kjent at dyrkingsforhold påvirker biokjemien til kiselalger, og dyrking i stor skala vil uunngåelig føre til en endring i miljøforholdene. denne studien ble derfor designet for å undersøke hvordan porosira glacialis dyrket i stor skala reagerer på endringer i abiotiske og biotiske dyrkingsforhold. den første studien undersøkte om direkte tilsetning av fabrikkrøyk som kilde til co2 ville endre produksjon av bioaktive eller toksiske forbindelser i p. glacialis. bioaktivitetstesting avdekket aktivitet i alle tester: anticancer, antibakteriell og anti-biofilm. i tillegg viste resultatene toksisitet som hemmet utvikling av kråkebolle-larver og humane lungefibroblaster. likevel økte ikke tilsetting av fabrikkrøyk toksisiteten til p. glacialis, og den hemmet heller ikke den gunstige antibakterielle og anti-biofilm-aktiviteten til algene. disse resultatene er svært positive for videre utvikling av storskala produksjon av kiselalger. p. glacialis ble dyrket sammen med dyreplankton for å undersøke om bioaktiviteten og utrykket av metabolitter ville endre seg når de ble utsatt for stress i form av beitetrykk. testing av bioaktivitet avslørte at tilstedeværelsen av zooplankton økte toksisiteten til p. glacialis mot humane normale lungefibroblaster. undersøkelse av aktive forbindelser og metabolittprofiler viste at beitetrykket muligens påvirker konsentrasjonen av karotenoider i p. glacialis, og at bioaktiviteten muligens kan spores til primære metabolitter som klorofyllderivater. studien viste også at bruk av osmac (one strain many compounds) kunne være en nyttig metode for videre undersøkelse av bioaktiviteten til kiselalger. undersøkelse av anti-biofilm-aktiviteten til p. glacialis resulterte i isolasjon av to forbindelser som viser inhibering av biofilmdannelse av bakterien staphylococcus epidermidis. de isolerte forbindelsene var metyl-3-hydroksyoktadekanoat og en pheophorbid-lignende struktur.

further, the carbon footprint calculations conducted by 16 higher education institutions were reviewed. this review analysed the categories chosen in the carbon footprint assessment, the standard utilised, the methodology applied, the categories of emissions included, as well as the benefits and limitation identified during the calculation process.

it was found that, while there are existing standards and guidelines for the calculation of organisational carbon footprints, the specific cases presented by universities were not supported by a specifically prepared guideline, leading to a variety of approaches used. the analysis also showed that, depending on the scopes of emissions, it is possible to discern the favoured methodologies. emissions related to energy consumption, as well as direct emissions, are more often calculated based on activity data and emission factors considered in life-cycle assessment, while indirect emissions related to procurements and the purchase of equipment are often determined using financial information based on the proceedings of input-output analysis. in addition, it was discovered that indirect emissions included vary strongly between the assessed institutions. the most popular categories were business travels, commuting, food, procurement and equipment, as well as emissions related to waste management and the maintenance of the property.

the results presented in this work can be utilised to support the ongoing carbon footprint calculation process of the university of oulu. the results also help in recognising the differences between various approaches and point out the necessity of creating a common framework for the assessment of emissions of higher education institutions",university of oulu,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2296'],"[{'name': 'Kiehle, J.

in particular, we propose that for 2025 the following goals are achieved: reduce the prevalence of smokers by  30%, with particular emphasis on young people; reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity by 20%; reduce the proportion of calories obtained from ultraprocessed foods by 20%; reduce the consumption of alcohol by 10%; reduce the consumption of salt by 30%; reduce the consumption of sugary drinks by 20%; reduce the average consumption of meat by 20%; increase the weekly hours of exercise by 10%. the aim is to complement individual health promotion with structural policies (such as urban planning, taxation and incentives) which render the former more effective and result in  a reduction in inequality. we strongly encourage the inclusion of primary prevention in all policies, in light of the described cobenefits. italy\u2019s role as the cohost of the 2020 (now 2021) un climate negotiations (cop26) presents the opportunity for international leadership in addressing health as an integral component of the response to climate change",bmj,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1106'],"[{'name': 'Vineis, Paolo'}, {'name': 'Beagley, Jessica'}, {'name': 'Bisceglia, Lucia'}, {'name': 'Carra, Luca'}, {'name': 'Cingolani, Roberto'}, {'name': 'Forastiere, Francesco'}, {'name': 'Musco, Francesco'}, {'name': 'Romanello, Marina'}, {'name': 'Saracci, Rodolfo'}]",strategy for primary prevention of non-communicable diseases (ncd) and mitigation of climate change in italy,2021,,

their models and validate their outputs, in some cases technology related data is not existent or

sparse because of novelty or small widespread. this is the case for emission mitigation strategies such

as carbon capture and sequestration, which can play a role in emission reduction scenarios. static

co2 capture potential analysis as well as project-related cost assessments have been thoroughly

reported in literature. these approaches have shortcomings. they assume constant boundary

conditions and usually focus on a single target year and region. energy system model analysis

however require various geographical scopes and temporal horizons.

to address this need, a flexible model is developed to generate cost potential curves in a

geographically distributed manner. in order to test the model, a literature research is done to

collect and harmonize input values such as cost and efficiency loss, these are then aggregated

and statistically analyzed to create error ranges of the model, given the diversity of the sources

the ranges are relatively wide. the geographical distribution is achieved using literature data

for industrial processes and open source energy production databases whose missing values are

completed using the available information within itself. to fill the gaps mainly in reported efficiency

values a computational regression model is built with moderately reliable results of 5% standard

error.

the cost potential distribution is calculated for the european union and their neighboring

countries, examples maps for germany, italy and the netherlands are built from this, insights on

the spatial distribution of the sources are done. curves for germany are drawn showing a technical

potential exceeding 25 mt/y only from industrial sources wit ha max price of 45 €/t and only on

demands of more than 70.7 mt/y the fossil fuels become relevant with a potential of more than 200

mt/y with a max price of 110 €/t.

basic scenario developments are modeled for germany and the eu27 countries using a naive

plant closing approach that builds on the geco scenarios also considering the german coal phase

out, the industrial sector development is not modeled. there is a 310 mt/y potential difference

between the reference and 1.5°c scenarios for the eu27 countries and no difference for germany

as the scenario emission goals are met by german coal phase-out by 2038.

a sensitivity analysis shows that higher efficiency losses imply a lower marginal cost of co2, the

same can be said for the capacity factor effect, reducing the capture efficiency from 90 % to 50%

increases the cost from 80 €/t to 150 €/t and the potential is reduced from 1500mt/y to 750 mt/y .

to further validate the data, cross-validation of the amounts is done using emission reports

compiled in the primap project but the comparison potential is limited given the high dependency

of assumptions. similarly with the aid of an alternative data source it was found that the whole

structure of the curve is sensitive to the input by changing the max potential from 1800 mt/y to

1600 mt/y and the median cost from 75 €/t to 50 €/t. with the available data it is concluded that

a comprehensive characterization of a 2.45 ghz microwave plasma torch in a vortex flow configuration operated in a large pressure range (30-1000 mbar) with pure co2 flow input is here presented. the main plasma characteristics are investigated by mass spectrometry (co2 decomposition), iccd imaging (plasma volume) and optical emission spectroscopy (gas temperature). this work aims to investigate the dependence of the co2 dissociation on the external parameters (pressure, power, flow), to try to establish a correlation between the plasma volume and gas temperature, and to determine the main mechanisms of the co2 dissociation. the focus is to optimize both co2 conversion and energy efficiency.



the plasma is driven in both continuous and pulsed mode. in continuous mode, steady state values of co2 conversion, plasma volume and gas temperature are determined. in the pulsed mode, the typical temporal evolution time scales of the co2 conversion, plasma volume and gas temperature are investigated.kohlendioxid co2 ist ein hochpotentes treibhausgas, das in sehr großen mengen bei industriellen prozessen und der stromerzeugung produziert wird. die reduzierung der in die atmosphäre freigesetzten co2 ist von entscheidender bedeutung, um des klimaveränderungen aufgrund des treibhauseffekts in den nächsten jahrzehnten abzumildern. aus diesem grund werden verschiedene strategien untersucht, um den verbrauch von co2 zu erhöhen und folglich seine freisetzung in die atmosphäre zu reduzieren. 

eine mögliche lösung ist die umwandlung von co2 zu co, das als primäres element für die synthese von kraftstoffen wie methanol verwendet wird. in dieser doktorarbeit wird die co2 dissoziation in mikrowellenplasmen als mögliche technologie für energieeffiziente co2 verwertung durch erneuerbare energien untersucht.

in particular, we propose that for 2025 the following goals are achieved: reduce the prevalence of smokers by  30%, with particular emphasis on young people; reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity by 20%; reduce the proportion of calories obtained from ultraprocessed foods by 20%; reduce the consumption of alcohol by 10%; reduce the consumption of salt by 30%; reduce the consumption of sugary drinks by 20%; reduce the average consumption of meat by 20%; increase the weekly hours of exercise by 10%. the aim is to complement individual health promotion with structural policies (such as urban planning, taxation and incentives) which render the former more effective and result in  a reduction in inequality. we strongly encourage the inclusion of primary prevention in all policies, in light of the described cobenefits. italy\u2019s role as the cohost of the 2020 (now 2021) un climate negotiations (cop26) presents the opportunity for international leadership in addressing health as an integral component of the response to climate change",bmj,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/1106'],"[{'name': 'Vineis, Paolo'}, {'name': 'Beagley, Jessica'}, {'name': 'Bisceglia, Lucia'}, {'name': 'Carra, Luca'}, {'name': 'Cingolani, Roberto'}, {'name': 'Forastiere, Francesco'}, {'name': 'Musco, Francesco'}, {'name': 'Romanello, Marina'}, {'name': 'Saracci, Rodolfo'}]",strategy for primary prevention of non-communicable diseases (ncd) and mitigation of climate change in italy,2021,,

the dissertation is divided into five manuscript chapters. the first manuscript, chapter two, begins with an overall discussion on decentralized energy: its opportunities, challenges, and justice considerations. the next manuscript, chapter three, compares the governance dimensions of decentralized energy transitions in three medium-sized northern cities.  using the same three case studies, chapter four compares the case studies using energy futures analysis. the remaining two manuscripts, chapter five and chapter six focus on a single case study of solar energy in saskatchewan. in chapter five, the paper explores the idea of effective public engagement that considers how energy justice issues can be used to drive de transitions. chapter six builds from the previous chapter and argues for practical suggestions to accelerate de transitions based on observations from the public engagement activities and a discussion on decision-making. 

this dissertation concludes with three insights that synthesize the aggregated findings. (1) there are unintended consequences to accelerated energy transitions. energy justice can be used as a framework to unearth tensions and potentially attempt to predict where unintended consequences may appear.

in order to study the volatility connection between the markets this study conducts a dcc-garch analysis. such modelling enables the investigation of return and volatility connection as well as the time-varying correlation between assets. thus, the model is able to provide valuable information about the constantly changing european emission market. the data utilized in this study ranges from january 2009 to march 2019 and includes daily prices from eu ets and nord pool electricity market. the data is gathered only from the second and third phase of eu ets as carbon price was practically zero at the end of the first trading phase. 

the main empirical findings suggest that the volatility and returns flow only from nordic electricity market to european emission market. no evidence of information or return flows of opposite direction is found. this could be due to nordic countries developing their production mixes to include more carbon-free generation. thus, the carbon price has a lower impact on region’s electricity price formation. further, electricity’s volatility could affect euas volatility as rapid changes in demand of electricity may force producers to ramp up carbon-intensive facilities. finally, analysis of hedging effectiveness proves that nordic electricity market participants can lower their downside risk by including carbon assets in their portfolios.ilmastonmuutoksen vääjäämätön uhka on kasvattanut yritysten sekä tutkijoiden mielen-kiintoa markkinaehtoista päästökauppaa kohtaan. euroopan päästömarkkinat ovat yksi van-himmista ja suurimmista päästöoikeuksien kauppapaikoista, jonka vuoksi siihen kohdistuu erityistä huomiota useilta tahoilta. energian tuotannon ja kulutuksen synnyttämät markki-nat puolestaan ovat yksi suurimmista yksittäisistä päästökaupan alaisista toimialoista. tä-män vuoksi on tärkeää tutkia ja ymmärtää energiamarkkinoiden ja päästökaupan välistä yhteyttä. aikaisemmat tutkimukset keskittyvät hintojen ja tuottojen väliseen yhteyteen ja jättävät usein näiden volatiliteettiyhteyden huomioimatta. tämä tutkimus pyrkii täyttä-mään tämän aukon tutkimalla pohjoismaisen sähkömarkkinan ja euroopan päästökaupan välistä volatiliteettiyhteyttä. 

tutkiakseen sähkömarkkinoiden ja päästökaupan välistä volatiliteettisuhdetta tämä tutki-mus hyödyntää dcc-garch-mallia. malli mahdollistaa markkinayhteyksien analysoinnin sekä tuotto- että volatiliteetti tasoilla. tämän lisäksi mallin avulla on mahdollista tutkia myös markkinoidenvälisen korrelaation kehitystä tutkimusperiodin aikana. tutkimuksessa käytetty aineisto on kerätty tammikuun 2009 ja maaliskuun 2019 väliseltä ajanjaksolta ja se koostuu päivittäisistä havainnoista euroopan päästömarkkinoilta sekä pohjoismaisilta sähkömarkkinoilta. tutkimusperiodi alkaa euroopan päästökaupan toisen jakson alusta, sillä ensimmäisen jakson lopussa päästöoikeudet olivat käytännössä arvottomia.

tutkimustulosten mukaan volatiliteetti- ja tuottovirrat markkinoiden välillä ovat yksisuun-taisia. tulokset indikoivat, että pohjoismainen sähkömarkkina vaikuttaa molemmilla tasoil-la euroopan päästökauppaan, mutta päästökaupalla ei ole tilastollisesti merkittävää vaiku-tusta sähkömarkkinoihin. tämä saattaa johtua vähäpäästöisen energiatuotannon määrän kasvusta euroopan ja erityisesti pohjoismaiden alueella, jonka vuoksi päästöoikeuden vai-kutus sähköntuotantoon laskee. lopuksi tutkimus analysoi onko pohjoismaisen sähkömark-kinatoimijan mahdollista laskea riskiään sisällyttämällä portfolioonsa päästöoikeuksia. tut-kimustulosten mukaan portfolio, jossa yhdistyvät päästöoikeudet sekä pohjoismainen säh-kö on matalariskisempi kuin vastaava portfolio, joka koostuu ainoastaan sähköstä",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/5594'],"[{'name': 'Vaissalo, Joonas Tapani'}]",volatility dynamics between eu ets and nordic electricity market,2021,,

biològica.la investigación que se describe se centra principalmente en la preparación de policarbonatos utilizando aceite de linaza epoxidado (elo) y aceite de soja epoxidado (eso) como materias primas. la presencia de insaturación en la estructura del aceite vegetal permite modificaciones químicas para introducir un grupo epoxi que luego se usa para sintetizar los policarbonatos mediante copolimerización catalítica con dióxido de carbono (co2). en este estudio, con la presencia de un catalizador heterogéneo se hizo reaccionar una mezcla de aceite vegetal epoxidado y óxido de propileno (po) con co2. los productos poliméricos producidos se caracterizaron utilizando espectroscopía de infrarrojos por transformada de fourier (ftir), espectroscopía de resonancia magnética nuclear de protones (1h nmr) y cromatografía de permeación en gel (gpc). la síntesis de policarbonato a través de esta vía ayuda a disminuir la dependencia de materias primas a base de petróleo y, además de emplear materias primas renovables, cumple con el séptimo principio de los 12 principios de la química verde que contribuye a la sostenibilidad en la química.
el trabajo de investigación se divide en cuatro fases. la primera fase comprende estudios preliminares mediante los cuales se realizó la preparación de un catalizador heterogéneo para la copolimerización del epóxido con co2. las pruebas de selección de catalizadores mostraron que el cianuro doble metálico de cobalto-zinc (co-zn dmc), un catalizador heterogéneo comúnmente empleado en la reacción de copolimerización, era factible para la copolimerización de óxido de ciclohexeno (cho) / co2 y po / co2. luego se llevó a cabo la epoxidación in situ de ácidos grasos insaturados utilizando aceites vegetales seleccionados para modificar el triglicérido en aceite vegetal epoxidado. se aplicó la relación molar de 0,4: 0,1: 1,7 (ácido orgánico: dobles enlaces: peróxido de hidrógeno) y la reacción de epoxidación tuvo lugar a 70ºc durante cinco horas. no se observó formación de polímero a partir de la terpolimerización de aceite de oliva epoxidado (eoo), aceite de palma epoxidado (epao) y aceite de girasol epoxidado (esfo) muy probablemente debido al bajo contenido de grupos epoxi. sin embargo, de los estudios preliminares se obtuvo un resultado prometedor tanto de elo como de eso mediante el cual se ha desarrollado con éxito un polímero a partir de la reacción de copolimerización.
la segunda fase del trabajo se centra en la copolimerización de eso, po y co2 catalizada por co-zn dmc. los productos se componen de una mezcla de poli (carbonato de propileno), carbonato cíclico y unidad de poliéter. el mn de los productos poliméricos registrados es 6498 g.mol-1 con el porcentaje de incorporación de eso en el polímero es solo del 7,8%.
la tercera fase del trabajo está dedicada al desarrollo de un poli (carbonato-co-éter) utilizando elo como material de partida. la reacción de terpolimerización se llevó a cabo a una presión fija de co2 de 5 mpa y varias cargas de catalizador, temperatura de reacción y tiempo de reacción. a una presión de co2 de 5 mpa, una temperatura de reacción de 60ºc, un tiempo de reacción de 24 hy una carga de catalizador de 0,2 g, se registró el polímero resultante con un mn máximo de 6,21 x 105 g.mol-1.
finalmente, se estudió la capacidad de degradación del polímero sintetizado en condiciones aeróbicas. la biodegradación aeróbica de los materiales de prueba se determinó en condiciones controladas de compostaje mediante el análisis del co2 desprendido utilizando un sistema respirométrico de medición directa (dmr) de construcción propia. los resultados de este estudio revelan que el 44,6% de pc-elo y el 51,8% de pc-eso se degradaron al final del período de prueba. ambos polímeros pudieron degradarse muy probablemente debido a que el comonómero empleado en la reacción de copolimerización es renovable y de base biológica.enginyeria de processos químic",universitat politècnica de catalunya,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/484'],"[{'name': 'Binti Shaarani, Farra Wahida'}]","synthesis and characterization of polycarbonates from epoxidized vegetable oils, propylene oxide and carbon dioxide",2021,,

this article offers several original contributions. first, it provides a unique assessment of how the deregulatory climate policies implemented nationally and internationally by the trump administration have magnified the covid-19 crisis. second, the law and economics methodology used in this article validates the claim that improving environmental quality is connected to optimizing early regulatory action. third, this article discusses the challenges of state liability for climate harms in the aftermath of the united states’ withdrawal from the paris agreement and concurrent covid-19 pandemic. finally, this article offers relevant insights for the literature on climate change that are likely to be applicable to critical future situations, whether they are health-related, a global economic crisis, or climate-related emergencies.
ultimately, this article concludes that, in the aggregate, all such climate change policies have contributed to increased pollution, including elevated greenhouse gas emissions that have aggravated pre-pandemic inequalities embedded within the united states and among countries. consequently, the domestic and international policy choices of the trump administration are worsening the impact of the pandemic, particularly for those in more vulnerable positions, as well as indelibly poisoning the global commons.

renewable resources like wind, water, sun, or biomass. within the first part of this work a structured review of recent literature on the long-term, strategic planning of biomass-based supply chains is provided. therefore, in the first step, the overall research field bioeconomy by means of the various utilization pathways of biomass is structured and the demand-oriented view of supply chain management models and the supply-oriented view of bioeconomy are combined. in the second step, a literature review of operations research models and methods for strategic supply chain planning in biomass-based industries are provided. thirdly, trends are identified and conclusions about research gaps are drawn. one of the identified research gaps is to make biomass-based supply chains profitable on their own, i.e., without governmental subsidies. therefore, new optimization models are necessary, which should be as close to reality as possible, by for example considering risks and actual surrounding constraints concerning the legal framework. within the second part of this work, an approach for strategic optimization of biogas plants considering increased flexibility is developed. biogas plants can produce their energy flexibly and on-demand if their design is adjusted adequately. in order to achieve a flexibly schedulable biogas plant, the design of this plant has to be adapted to decouple the biogas and electricity production. therefore, biogas storage possibilities and additional electrical capacity are necessary. the investment decision about the size of the biogas storage and the additional electrical capacity depends on the fluctuation of energy market prices and the availability of governmental subsidies. this work presents an approach supporting investment decisions to increase the flexibility of a biogas plant by installing gas storages and additional electrical capacities under consideration of revenues out of direct marketing at the day-ahead market. in order to support the strategic, long-term investment decisions, an operative plant schedule for the future, considering different plant designs given as investment strategies, using a mixed-integer linear programming (milp) model in an uncertain environment is optimized. the different designs can be evaluated by calculating the net present value (npv). moreover, an analysis concerning current dynamics and uncertainties within spot market prices is executed. furthermore, the influences concerning the variation of spot market prices compared to the influence of governmental subsidies, in particular, the flexibility premium, are revealed by computational results. besides, the robustness of the determined solution is analyzed concerning uncertainties. the focus of the third part of the work is to consider variable substrate feeding in the mentioned optimization approach because it is expected that variable substrate feeding and thus a demand-oriented biogas production can influence the optimized plant design. in order to support this extension, an operative plant schedule for the future, considering (non-) linear technical characteristics of the biogas plant and the legal framework is optimized. therefore, mixed-integer linear programming models with integrated approximation approaches of non-linear parts, representing the biogas production rates, are constructed. furthermore, the influences of fluctuating spot market prices, governmental subsidies, and biomass feedstock prices on the decisions are analyzed for a fictional case example, which is based on a biogas plant in southern germany. these numerical experiments show that variable substrate feeding can play a decisive role during the optimization of a biogas plant schedule as part of a long-term design optimization. however, the size of the strategic optimization problem makes the use of a heuristic solution algorithm necessary.fossile ressourcen sind begrenzt und werden zur neige gehen. darüber hinaus wird über die extensive nutzung fossiler ressourcen als wesentlicher treiber des klimawandels diskutiert, so dass ein umdenken in der ökonomischen und ökologischen grundhaltung notwendig ist. insbesondere bei der energieerzeugung muss eine abkehr von der nutzung fossiler ressourcen und eine ausrichtung auf erneuerbare ressourcen wie wind, wasser, sonne oder biomasse erfolgen. im ersten teil dieser arbeit wird ein strukturierter überblick über die aktuelle fachliteratur zur langfristigen, strategischen planung von biomassebasierten supply chains gegeben. dazu wird in einem ersten schritt das gesamte forschungsfeld ""bioökonomie"" anhand der verschiedenen nutzungspfade von biomasse strukturiert und die nachfrageorientierte sichtweise von supply chain

strategischen supply-chain-planung in biomassebasierten branchen gegeben. im dritten schritt werden trends identifiziert und schlussfolgerungen über forschungslücken gezogen. eine der identifizierten forschungslücken besteht darin, biomassebasierte supply chains selbständig, d.h. ohne staatliche subventionen, profitabel zu machen. hierfür sind neue optimierungsmodelle notwendig, die möglichst realitätsnah sein sollten, indem sie z.b. risiken und tatsächliche rahmenbedingungen bezüglich der rechtlichen vorgaben berücksichtigen. im zweiten teil dieser arbeit wird ein ansatz zur strategischen optimierung von biogasanlagen unter berücksichtigung einer flexibilitätserhöhung entwickelt. biogasanlagen können bei geeigneter auslegung ihre energie flexibel und bedarfsgerecht produzieren. um eine biogasanlage flexibel planbar zu betreiben, muss das design dieser anlage so angepasst werden, dass die biogas- und stromproduktion entkoppelt werden. dazu sind biogasspeichermöglichkeiten und zusätzliche elektrische kapazität notwendig. die investitionsentscheidung über die größe des biogasspeichers und der zusätzlichen elektrischen kapazität hängt von der schwankung der energiemarktpreise und der verfügbarkeit staatlicher fördermittel ab. diese arbeit stellt einen ansatz zur unterstützung von investitionsentscheidungen zur erhöhung der flexibilität einer biogasanlage durch die installation von gasspeichern und zusätzlichen elektrischen kapazitäten unter berücksichtigung von erlösen aus der direktvermarktung am day-ahead-markt vor. um die strategischen, langfristigen investitionsentscheidungen zu unterstützen, wird ein operativer anlagenfahrplan für die zukunft unter berücksichtigung verschiedener anlagendesigns, die als investitionsstrategien vorgegeben sind, mit hilfe eines gemischt-ganzzahligen linearen optimierungsmodells (milp), unter berücksichtigung von unsicherheit, optimiert. die verschiedenen designs können durch die berechnung des kapitalwerts (npv) bewertet werden. darüber hinaus wird eine analyse der aktuellen dynamik und der unsicherheiten der spotmarktpreise durchgeführt. darüber hinaus werden die einflüsse der varianz der spotmarktpreise im vergleich zum einfluss staatlicher subventionen, insbesondere der flexibilitätsprämie, durch berechnungsergebnisse aufgezeigt. außerdem wird die robustheit der ermittelten lösung hinsichtlich der unsicherheiten analysiert. der fokus des dritten teils der arbeit liegt auf der berücksichtigung eines variablen substratmanagements in dem entwickelten optimierungsansatz, da erwartet wird, dass eine variable substrateinspeisung und damit eine bedarfsgerechte biogasproduktion das optimierte anlagendesign beeinflussen kann. um diese erweiterung umzusetzen, wird ein operativer anlagenfahrplan für die zukunft unter berücksichtigung (nicht-) linearer technischer eigenschaften der biogasanlage und der gesetzlichen rahmenbedingungen optimiert. dazu werden gemischt-ganzzahlige lineare

spotmarktpreisen, staatlichen förderungen und biomasse-rohstoffpreisen auf die entscheidungen für ein fiktives fallbeispiel, das auf einer biogasanlage aus süddeutschland basiert, analysiert. die numerischen experimente zeigen, dass die variable substrateinspeisung bei der optimierung des fahrplans einer biogasanlage im rahmen einer langfristigen anlagenoptimierung eine entscheidende rolle

this thesis investigates the modelling using aspen plus of the vantaan energia waste-to-energy thermal power plant, taken as a reference case, to its retrofitting into a municipal solid waste oxy-fuel combustion thermal power plant with alkaline electrolysis cells. 
the simulation results report that the proposed design is not electrically self-sustainable, which requires an additional supply of 365.5 mwel. the electrical demand might be fulfilled by involving wind park design, which should have a nominal installed power of 1100 mw in order to smooth wind production fluctuations. the wind park installation could result in a higher cost of the system. nevertheless, the simulation indicates the economic feasibility of the proposed municipal solid waste oxy-fuel combustion system owing to a massive produc-tion of thermal power for district heating purpose equal to 191.1 mw. the alkaline electroly-sis cells produce 278 mw of hydrogen fuel power. the oxy-fuel combustion system has an overall efficiency of 26.21%. the simulated retrofitted thermal power plant produces hydro-gen with a levelized cost of 0.851 eur/kg. the simulated thermal power plant produces hydrogen and carbon dioxide with a ratio of 2.48:1 (h2-co2), close to methanol production stoichiometric reaction. the reduction in hydrogen cost consecutively results in the eco-nomic feasibility of a methanol power plant, which would have a methanol selling price break-even cost of 0.221 eur/kg. the exploitation of municipal solid waste effectively re-duces the cost of hydrogen.

still, solar power generation has some inherent challenges. most importantly, due to the variance of solar irradiation, solar pv based power generation is variable over the time of day and year. thus, any electricity grids incorporating solar panels must include power grid balancing measures. moreover, the location of such systems is paramount when investments are considered, as the electricity potential varies across different geographies.

spatial decision making, such as choosing the location of solar systems, often involves conflicting criteria and a multitude of potential alternatives. while methods and objectives vary, geographic information systems (gis) are often used to support spatial decision making. as the locations of solar power installations are paramount to their efficiency, spatial decision making combined with gis has often been used in the literature concerning solar systems.

which means that a changeover in basic economic and ecological thinking is necessary. especially for energy production, there has to be a movement away from the usage of fossil resources and towards renewable resources like wind, water, sun, or biomass. within the first part of this work a structured review of recent literature on the long-term, strategic planning of biomass-based supply chains is provided. therefore, in the first step, the overall research field bioeconomy by means of the various utilization pathways of biomass is structured and the demand-oriented view of supply chain management models and the supply-oriented view of bioeconomy are combined. in the second step, a literature review of operations research models and methods for strategic supply chain planning in biomass-based industries are provided. thirdly, trends are identified and conclusions about research gaps are drawn. one of the identified research gaps is to make biomass-based supply chains profitable on their own, i.e., without governmental subsidies. therefore, new optimization models are necessary, which should be as close to reality as possible, by for example considering risks and actual surrounding constraints concerning the legal framework. within the second part of this work, an approach for strategic optimization of biogas plants considering increased flexibility is developed. biogas plants can produce their energy flexibly and on-demand if their design is adjusted adequately. in order to achieve a flexibly schedulable biogas plant, the design of this plant has to be adapted to decouple the biogas and electricity production. therefore, biogas storage possibilities and additional electrical capacity are necessary. the investment decision about the size of the biogas storage and the additional electrical capacity depends on the fluctuation of energy market prices and the availability of governmental subsidies. this work presents an approach supporting investment decisions to increase the flexibility of a biogas plant by installing gas storages and additional electrical capacities under consideration of revenues out of direct marketing at the day-ahead market. in order to support the strategic, long-term investment decisions, an operative plant schedule for the future, considering different plant designs given as investment strategies, using a mixed-integer linear programming (milp) model in an uncertain environment is optimized. the different designs can be evaluated by calculating the net present value (npv). moreover, an analysis concerning current dynamics and uncertainties within spot market prices is executed. furthermore, the influences concerning the variation of spot market prices compared to the influence of governmental subsidies, in particular, the flexibility premium, are revealed by computational results. besides, the robustness of the determined solution is analyzed concerning uncertainties. the focus of the third part of the work is to consider variable substrate feeding in the mentioned optimization approach because it is expected that variable substrate feeding and thus a demand-oriented biogas production can influence the optimized plant design. in order to support this extension, an operative plant schedule for the future, considering (non-) linear technical characteristics of the biogas plant and the legal framework is optimized. therefore, mixed-integer linear programming models with integrated approximation approaches of non-linear parts, representing the biogas production rates, are constructed. furthermore, the influences of fluctuating spot market prices, governmental subsidies, and biomass feedstock prices on the decisions are analyzed for a fictional case example, which is based on a biogas plant in southern germany. these numerical experiments show that variable substrate feeding can play a decisive role during the optimization of a biogas plant schedule as part of a long-term design optimization. however, the size of the strategic optimization problem makes the use of a heuristic solution algorithm necessary.fossile ressourcen sind begrenzt und werden

realitätsnah sein sollten, indem sie z.b. risiken und tatsächliche rahmenbedingungen bezüglich der rechtlichen vorgaben berücksichtigen. im zweiten teil dieser arbeit wird ein ansatz zur strategischen optimierung von biogasanlagen unter berücksichtigung einer flexibilitätserhöhung entwickelt. biogasanlagen können bei geeigneter auslegung ihre energie flexibel und bedarfsgerecht produzieren. um eine biogasanlage flexibel planbar zu betreiben, muss das design dieser anlage so angepasst werden, dass die biogas- und stromproduktion entkoppelt werden. dazu sind biogasspeichermöglichkeiten und zusätzliche elektrische kapazität notwendig. die investitionsentscheidung über die größe des biogasspeichers und der zusätzlichen elektrischen kapazität hängt von der schwankung der energiemarktpreise und der verfügbarkeit staatlicher fördermittel ab. diese arbeit stellt einen ansatz zur unterstützung von investitionsentscheidungen zur erhöhung der flexibilität einer biogasanlage durch die installation von gasspeichern und zusätzlichen elektrischen kapazitäten unter berücksichtigung von erlösen aus der direktvermarktung am day-ahead-markt vor. um die strategischen, langfristigen

vergleich zum einfluss staatlicher subventionen, insbesondere der flexibilitätsprämie, durch berechnungsergebnisse aufgezeigt. außerdem wird die robustheit der ermittelten lösung hinsichtlich der unsicherheiten analysiert. der fokus des dritten teils der arbeit liegt auf der berücksichtigung eines variablen substratmanagements in dem entwickelten optimierungsansatz, da erwartet wird, dass eine variable substrateinspeisung und damit eine bedarfsgerechte biogasproduktion das optimierte anlagendesign beeinflussen kann. um diese erweiterung umzusetzen, wird ein operativer anlagenfahrplan für

energy crops have the most potential to increase biomass production in the uk, and annual energy crops (e.g. maize and grass) are popular with farmers, but cultivation of the pecs miscanthus and short rotation coppice willow has stagnated because of limited markets, competitive cereal prices, the length of commitment required, and cultural barriers.  sustainably managed woodlands can deliver carbon sequestration, and woodfuel, but barriers to creation include the permanence of planting, loss of annual farming income, expense of planting and maintenance, and cultural divisions between forestry and farming.  although a considerable volume of poultry litter is produced in the uk, bioenergy use is constrained by the competing demand for organic fertiliser, and the high capital cost of on-farm combustion.  

significant policy action will be needed in the uk to increase biomass supply.  demand side incentives could create a market for pec biomass, support attractive long-term contracts, and stimulate growth of the full supply chain, while short term planting support could also be effective to drive adoption.  woodland creation could be driven by rewards for delivering carbon sequestration (a public good), and attractive grants to cover establishment costs and replace lost income.  more information and education could overcome the traditional divide between farming and forestry.  the new environmental land management scheme in england (and corresponding schemes in the rest of the uk) will also be vital in delivering the landscape scale changes of land use needed to meet the uk ’s net zero targets, including the changes required to increase the domestic supply of biomass for bioenergy",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/139'],"[{'name': 'Ford, Judith Sarah'}]",the prospects for increasing uk production of feedstocks for bioenergy,2021,,

the development of a new volumetric mga method is reported in the first section of this study. the design of the method is discussed and the benchmarking of the instrument against previously published sga data is shown. the mga equilibria of co2 and n2, when adsorbed by zeolite 13x, are reported. these data are compared to the results of the predictive ideal adsorbed solution theory (iast) method, where it is found that iast performs well with predicting the uptake of co2 but fails to correctly predict the uptake of n2. additionally, an empirical model, namely the extended sips isotherm, performs surprisingly well with predicting the mixed uptakes of both co2 and n2 accurately around 1 bar, where iast does not.
using the findings of the first section as inspiration, the extended sips is utilized alongside the non-ideal (real) case of the adsorbed solution theory (rast), to create a new predictive mga method named prast-s. this method is used to predict the mixed uptakes of co2 and n2 by cu-hkust-1, mg-mof-74, mof-14, and uio-66. furthermore, the mga equilibria of co2 and n2 obtained using the instrument described in the first section are also reported for cu-hkust-1 to confirm that prast-s correctly predicts the adsorbed amounts. however, what was not anticipated was that the experimental measurements and prast-s prediction both show that cu-hkust-1 exhibits ideal adsorption of co2 and n2. this is in contrast with the other materials studied, which all exhibit non-ideal adsorption.
a series of in silico simulations of co2 and n2 within the pores of 13x and cu-hkust-1 to probe the differences in ideal and non-ideal behavior shows that a sudden shift in the mean interaction energy upon mixing is the telltale sign of non-ideal adsorption. furthermore, the mechanism that led to the shift in the mean interaction energy – or the lack thereof, in the ideal cases – is shown to be dependent on the mode with which the adsorbates interact with the adsorbent",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/926'],"[{'name': 'Costandius, Jan'}]",a hybrid experimental and theoretical investigation into the multi-component gas adsorption properties of selected porous materials,2021,,

the examined energy wood is utilized, for example, in a pyrolysis and/or extractant plant. the symbiosis is formed when a production plant utilizes the steam of a biopower plant and the biopower plant utilizes the bio-based by-products of the production plant as its fuel. there are already symbioses of steam with chemical plants in the area, but there is potential to generate steam for new entrants as well. symbiosis of carbon recovery arises if co₂ is refined or used directly in the region’s industry. for symbioses to develop effectively, it would be good to have governance in the region. the most potential governance model in this case is the public administration/coordinator and corporate governance model. networks or direct contact can be used to find new companies.

it was found that the laanila industrial area already has activities that meet the criteria of the eco-industrial park. the results of the thesis can be utilized in the future in the development of the park’s symbioses. the symbiosis design method used can also be utilized in other industrial areas",university of oulu,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2296'],"[{'name': 'Lahtinen, M.

this study reveals how fully decarbonized european power systems can benefit from hydrogen in terms of overall system costs and the achievement of strategic policy targets. we analyzed a broad spectrum of scenarios using an energy system optimization model and varied model constraints that reflect strategic policy targets. our results are threefold. first, compared to power systems without hydrogen, systems using hydrogen realize savings of 14-16% in terms of the total system costs. second, the implementation of a hydrogen infrastructure reduces the number of infeasible scenarios when structural policy targets are considered within the power system. third, the role of hydrogen is highly diverse at a national level. particularly, in countries with low renewable energy potential, hydrogen plays a crucial role. here, high levels of self-sufficiency and security of supply are achieved by deploying hydrogen-based power generation of up to 46% of their annual electricity demand, realized via imports of green hydrogen",elsevier bv,"['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/336', 'https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/645']","[{'name': 'Sasanpour, Shima'}, {'name': 'Cao, Karl-Kiên'}, {'name': 'Gils, Hans Christian'}, {'name': 'Jochem, Patrick'}]",strategic policy targets and the contribution of hydrogen in a 100% renewable european power system,2021,Energy Reports,['2352-4847']

an increase in the field of biogas purification and upgrading research. among the variety of existing purification and upgrading techniques, one of the most used today is adsorption, specifically pressure swing adsorption (psa) as it is convenient when a cost-efficiency balance is made. to describe the dynamic behavior of an adsorption column, it is necessary to know the effluent concentration-time profile, also called the breakthrough curve. a good prediction of the breakthrough curve is essential to ensure the normal and safe operation of the process. among the existing mathematical models to make this prediction, the bohart-adams model is one of the oldest and simplest in terms of mathematical application. this model considers that the operation is carried out at a constant velocity, but when the feed concentration is high, as in the case of biogas purification where we can have co2 concentrations of up to 50%, the velocity cannot be considered constant. in this work, the different forms of the bohart-adams equation were studied and it was observed that this model, tomas's and yoon nelson's are the same with minor modifications. the main advantage of the use of a mathematically simple model such as bohart-adams for the design and scale-up in an adsorption process is to shorten the times in determining the design variables and construction parameters of the equipment and this advantage is accompanied by a reduction in costs in the design and calculation stage of the process. seeking to transfer the mathematical simplicity of this equation to cases in which high concentrations are used, tests were performed using the bohart-adams logistic form, studying the changes in the fit of the experimental data when a correction for variable velocity is applied in the stoichiometric time calculation. these tests were carried out with three types of adsorbents along with three different concentrations, the three adsorbents were: activated carbon, pellets cubtc and bulk cubtc and the concentrations used were 20%, 33% and 50% co2. it was found that using the sigmoid or logistic form of bohart-adams, good adjustments were achieved even with initial concentrations of 50%. in the end, it is shown how the parameters obtained from this model are useful to make a scale-up in a simple way.a produção de biogás cresceu notavelmente nos últimos anos e espera-se que esse crescimento continue nos próximos anos. este crescimento leva a um aumento no campo da purificação do biogás e pesquisa de atualização. entre a variedade de técnicas de purificação e atualização existentes, uma das mais usadas hoje é a adsorção, especificamente a adsorção por variação de pressão (psa), pois é conveniente quando é feito um equilíbrio de custo-benefício. para descrever o comportamento dinâmico de uma coluna de adsorção, é necessário conhecer o perfil concentração-tempo do efluente, também chamado de curva de ruptura. uma boa previsão da curva de ruptura é essencial para garantir o funcionamento normal e seguro do processo. dentre os modelos matemáticos existentes para fazer essa previsão, o modelo bohart-adams é um dos mais antigos e simples em termos de aplicação matemática. este modelo considera que a operação é realizada a uma velocidade constante, mas quando a concentração de alimentação é alta, como no caso da purificação do biogás onde podemos ter concentrações de co2 de até 50%, a velocidade não pode ser considerada constante. neste trabalho, as diferentes formas da equação de bohart-adams foram estudadas e observou-se que este modelo, o de tomas e o de yoon nelson são iguais, com pequenas modificações. a principal vantagem do uso de um modelo matematicamente simples como bohart-adams para o projeto e aumento de escala em um processo de adsorção é encurtar os tempos na determinação das variáveis de projeto e parâmetros de construção do equipamento e esta vantagem é acompanhada por um redução de custos na fase de desenho e cálculo do processo. em busca de transferir a simplicidade matemática desta equação para os casos em que são utilizadas altas concentrações, foram realizados testes utilizando a forma logística de bohart-adams, estudando as alterações no ajuste dos dados experimentais quando uma correção para velocidade variável é aplicada no estequiométrico cálculo do tempo. estes testes foram realizados com três tipos de adsorventes juntamente com três concentrações diferentes, os três adsorventes foram: carvão ativado, pellets cubtc e bulk cubtc e as concentrações utilizadas foram 20%, 33% e 50% co2. verificou-se que usando a forma sigmóide ou logística de bohart-adams, bons ajustes foram alcançados mesmo com concentrações iniciais de 50%. ao final, mostra-se

both trace potential environmental impacts and resource use along supply chains.  mfa traces the movement and accumulation of materials throughout a system and over time. the goal of this dissertation is to utilize and innovate upon eeio, lca, and mfa to address a set of environmental issues related to a variety of capital-intensive product systems.  the dissertation begins by enhancing the useeio model through endogenization of capital assets.  the useeio model was developed by the us epa to analyze environmental impacts of around 400 goods and services in the us economy.  due to the structure of eeio models, the investment in long-lived capital assets is considered separately from the exchanges of short-lived goods and services between producing sectors.  considering the environmental intensity of creating capital assets, it is important to incorporate the use of these assets in production processes, especially when comparing environmental impacts of alternative product systems. the dissertation next focuses on metal footprints, with an emphasis on metal in capital assets.  the approach combines multi-regional eeio analysis with mfa.  existing metal footprints trace the gross ore from the source to the end product and final consumer, and do not endogenize capital.  the gross ore is mostly comprised of rock; the desired metal that continues along the supply chain is only a fraction.  given the high variation in the ore grade between types of metals, the ore-based metal footprint differs substantially from that calculated based on the valuable metal contained in the ore.  in this work, an approach is developed and demonstrated to trace the valuable metal from the source through the supply chain and compare results with the typical approach.  these metal contained footprints are compared with and without the capital assets endogenized.  the analysis explores drivers of change over time, national trends, and potential environmental impacts of metal production. the dissertation then pivots to an lca case study of a specific innovative product system: commercial aircraft powered by liquid hydrogen combustion.  a variety of strategies are being pursued in attempts to decarbonize civil aviation, which is very challenging due the technical constraints of commercial flight. hydrogen has been considered as a fuel over the decades but has recently been re-proposed as a possible solution by airbus, with a caveat that the hydrogen would need to be produced from renewable electricity to net an environmental benefit.  currently, most hydrogen in the world is produced from natural gas and coal.  there are no recent comprehensive studies on the potential environmental and human health benefits and tradeoffs of transitioning from a fleet powered by conventional petroleum jet fuel to one powered by hydrogen combustion.  therefore, this study is a comprehensive, comparative well-to-wake lca.  the use of capital assets are of course included throughout the life cycle; the assets drive the relative performance of some hydrogen production pathways.  many forms of uncertainty are captured in a simulation model, and influential parameters are identified.  recommendations are provided on critical areas for further study necessary to determine whether and under what scenarios to initiate a shift to hydrogen-powered aviation. this dissertation addresses several aspects of environmental assessments of capital-intensive product systems.  the tools of ie have been shown to be effective for distilling key metrics for comparison between nations and product systems.  though the chapters do not build upon each other linearly, they overlap, and each help fill in different pieces of the same sustainability puzzle",elischolar – a digital platform for scholarly publishing at yale,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/3615'],"[{'name': 'Miller, Travis Reed'}]",environmental assessments of capital-intensive product systems,2021,,

carbon capture using chemical solvents is the most matured technology for capturing emissions from the energy sector, however as the energy sector continues to decarbonise with the arrival of renewable sources focus is shifting to other industries to reduce their carbon footprint. solvent carbon capture has disadvantages including requiring large equipment and large amounts of heat to regenerate solvent for capture, meaning it would be difficult to scale the technology down and apply it to other industrial applications.
cryogenic carbon capture (ccc) is one proposed method of ccs at smaller scale, which captures co2 by freezing co2 out of the exhaust gases as co2 forms a frost on a heat transfer surface. one disadvantage of ccc is the accumulation of co2 frost reduces the efficiency of the capture process. the process must be periodically shut down to regenerate the heat transfer surface and collect co2 that has been frozen out of exhaust gases. this thesis proposes to overcome the frost accumulation through the use of a moving packed bed of small spherical metal beads as the heat transfer surface. as co2 is fed into a capture column and freezes onto the metal beads, the metal beads are removed from the column, regenerated to recover the co2, then cooled and recirculated back into the capture column. this prevents the accumulation of frost and allows continuous co2 capture.
there are many difficulties identified in this project, primarily a lack of knowledge on co2 frost formation and how heat transfer in a moving bed affects frost formation. the research done on a purpose built experimental rig is critical in improving the future design work of a next generation moving bed ccc system. the frost accumulation in a capture column is known as a frost front, which advanced through the capture column at a fixed velocity until the column is saturated with frost. experimental results had shown that the frost front velocity is predictable for varying co2 concentrations and gas flow rates, with frost front velocities between 0.46-0.78 mm/s for co2 concentrations between 4-18% v/v and 0.36-0.98 mm/s for gas flow rates between 50-120 lpm. these frost front velocity experiments in a fixed packed bed allowed the design of a moving packed bed column to set the bed flow rate to match the frost front velocity. the moving bed experiments show that the excessive accumulation of co2 frost within the capture column can be prevented by utilising the moving bed.
the successful development of a moving bed ccc system would result in a cost effective solution to the requirements of certain smaller applications that need to capture co2, which make up a significant portion of emissions. in particular this technology is very economical for biogas upgrading, where the co2 content of biogas must be removed before the gas can be introduced to the uk’s larger gas network. there is also a growing interest for use in shipping and other maritime applications, capturing co2 from ship exhaust emissions during transit",university of chester,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/19'],"[{'name': 'Cann, David G.'}]",experimental exploration of cryogenic co2 capture utilising a moving bed,2021,,

in der vorliegenden arbeit werden untersuchungen zu der katalytischen darstellung von formaldehyd, beziehungsweise dessen acetal dimethoxymethan, aus dem treibhausgas kohlenstoffdioxid beschrieben. wasserstoffgas diente dabei als reduktionsmittel. formaldehyd ist ein wichtiger grundbaustein in der chemischen industrie, von dem jedes jahr mehrere millionen tonnen hergestellt und verarbeitet werden. der syntheseweg über methanol, welcher zurzeit anwendung findet, ist nicht atom-ökonomisch und basiert gänzlich auf fossilen ausgangsstoffen und energieträgern. ein neuer katalytischer prozess ist daher höchst erstrebenswert.

für die reduktive transformation von kohlenstoffdioxid wurde eine vielzahl an ruthenium-phosphin-katalysatoren mit unterschiedlicher chemischer struktur hergestellt und charakterisiert. in einer katalytischen voruntersuchung konnten aus dieser erstellten katalysatorbibliothek vielversprechende kandidaten identifiziert werden. diese verbindungen weisen strukturelle ähnlichkeiten auf und wurden in einem darauffolgenden linearen screening auf ihre aktivität umfassend untersucht. dabei wurden sieben prozessparameter der katalyse nacheinander optimiert. diese sind die temperatur, der partialdruck von kohlenstoffdioxid sowie wasserstoff, die reaktionszeit, die als co-katalysator verwendete lewis-säure und die stoffmengen des ruthenium-katalysators sowie der lewis-säure. für das in der untersuchten reaktion gewünschte produkt dimethoxymethan konnte eine aktivitätssteigerung auf das dreieinhalbfache im vergleich zu vorherigen berichten erzielt werden. die aktivität für das in dieser reaktion als zwischenprodukt gebildete methylformiat wurde zum zeitpunkt der untersuchungen ebenfalls auf einen maximalwert gesteigert. die untersuchten katalysatoren wurden hinsichtlich ihrer strukturellen und katalytischen eigenschaften verglichen. anhand einer arbeit zur multivariaten prozessoptimierung für das katalysator-system mit der höchsten aktivität, wurde das potential von algorithmus-basierten arbeitstechniken gezeigt.

für ein tiefergehendes verständnis der reaktion sowie der einzelnen teilschritte wurde das zugrunde liegende reaktionsnetzwerk der katalyse untersucht. mithilfe von in situ ir-spektroskopischen messungen wurden die zeitlichen reaktionsverläufe der konzentrationen von methylformiat und dimethoxymethan beobachtet. aus den dabei erhaltenen erkenntnissen sowie aus ergebnissen vorangegangener arbeiten wurde ein reaktionsnetzwerk aufgestellt, welches alle relevanten teilschritte beinhaltet. durch analyse der spektroskopischen daten konnten die kinetischen charakteristika und aktivierungsparameter der ruthenium-katalysierten reduktionsschritte ermittelt werden. der geschwindigkeitsbestimmende schritt ist die umwandlung von kohlenstoffdioxid zu methylformiat. den größten einfluss auf den verlauf der reaktion hat die temperatur. als vielversprechende möglichkeit, den prozess weiter zu optimieren, wurde das entfernen von wasser aus der reaktionslösung identifiziert. wasser wirkt der bildung von dimethoxymethan entgegen und beschleunigt die zersetzung von methylformiat zu kohlenstoffdioxid und wasserstoff, die rückreaktion des ersten reduktiven schritts. das erarbeitete kinetische modell wurde abschließend verwendet, um reaktionsverläufe über den untersuchten parameterraum hinaus vorherzusagen. anhand dieser simulationen wurden parameterkombinationen identifiziert, bei denen als hauptprodukt entweder methylformiat, dimethoxymethan oder methanol entsteht. die ergebnisse korrelieren mit vorangegangenen experimentellen untersuchungen und verdeutlichen das potential von kinetischen simulationsmodellen für die prozessoptimierung.in science and industry, catalytic reactions are a keystone for efficient economic processes. in addition, catalysts play a crucial role in numerous biochemical processes. understanding and improving existing procedures as well as the development of new and innovative catalyses is therefore constantly being pursued.

in this thesis, investigations into the catalytic production of formaldehyde, and its acetal dimethoxymethane respectively, from the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide is described, for which hydrogen gas was utilized as reducing agent. formaldehyde is an important basic building block in the chemical industy and is produced and processed on a multimillion ton scale every year. the current synthetic route via methanol is atom-inefficient and based entirely on fossil feedstocks and energy sources. thus, a novel catalytic process is highly desirable.

various ruthenium-phosphine-catalysts with different chemical structures have been prepared and characterized for the reductive transformation of carbon dioxide. in a first catalytic investigation, promising candidates were identified from the prepared catalyst library. these compounds show structural similarities and in a subsequent linear screening they were extensively investigated with regard to their activity. in this process, seven catalytic parameters were successively optimized. these are the temperature, the partial pressure of carbon dioxide and hydrogen, the reaction time, the lewis acid used as co-catalyst as well as the amounts of ruthenium catalyst and lewis acid. for the desired product dimethoxymethane, an increase in activity by a factor of 3.5 was obtained compared to previous reports. the activity for the intermediate methyl formate was also increased to the highest value reported up to that date. the investigated catalysts were compared in terms of their structural and catalytic properties. based on the study of a multivariate process optimization for the catalyst with the highest activity, the potential of algorithmic workflows was illustrated.

in addition, the reaction network underlying the catalysis was investigated to gain a deeper understanding of the reaction and the individual sub-steps. using in situ ir-spectroscopy, the reaction courses of the concentrations of methyl formate and dimethoxymethane were observed. taking into account findings from the in situ measurements and results of previous reports, a reaction network was defined, incorporating all relevant reaction steps. by analyzing the spectroscopic data, the kinetic characteristics and activation parameters of the ruthenium-catalyzed reduction steps were determined. the conversion of carbon dioxide to methyl formate is the rate-determining step. the temperature has the largest influence on the reaction course. removal of water from the reaction solution was identified as a promising way to further optimize the process. water has a negative effect on the formation of dimethoxymethane and accelerates the decomposition of methyl formate to carbon dioxide and hydrogen, the reverse reaction of the first reductive step. finally, the proposed kinetic model was used to predict reaction profiles outside the investigated experimental boundaries. based on these simulations, parameter combinations were identified in which either methyl formate, dimethoxymethane, or methanol is formed as the main product. the results correlate with previous studies and illustrate the potential of kinetic simulation models for process optimization",ludwig-maximilians-universität münchen,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/332'],"[{'name': 'Leopold, Max'}]",triphos- und hetero-triphos-ruthenium-komplexe in der reduktiven transformation von kohlenstoffdioxid zu formaldehyd-derivaten,2021,,

in this study, cerium oxide (ceria) prepared through the reverse microemulsion (rme) process is used as a base catalytic material. an extensive investigation has been conducted to assess the potential of the rme-based bulk ceria and supported ceria on γ-alumina towards rwgs reaction, including reaction tests and several characterization techniques including x-ray diffraction (xrd), thermogravimetric analysis (tga), fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (ftir) to determine outlet gas composition, scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (sem-edx) to determine the surface elemental composition, gas adsorption to determine the specific surface area (bet-ssa) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (icp-oes) to determine the bulk composition, tem (transmission electron microscope) to look for the particle shape and find the crystalline planes, tpr (temperature-programmed reduction) to check the reducing abilities of the catalyst, co2-tpd to find the relevant active site and in-situ ftir studies to find the rwgs reaction mechanism.  
first, rwgs reaction was studied over unsupported bulk ceria (ceo2) prepared by reverse microemulsion (rme) method and direct precipitated method. using a unique microemulsion ratio, highly porous ceria nanoparticles (rme-ceria) with targeted exposed (111) facets and high specific surface area of 142 m2 gcat-1 were successfully synthesized compared to ceria nanoparticles prepare via direct precipitation method (dp-ceria) with specific surface area of 101 m2 gcat-1. long term stability tests (almost 100 h on stream) showed well stable activity of rme-ceria towards the rwgs. at lower ghsv of 10,000 ml gcat-1 h-1, nearly equilibrium conversion (~ 62%) was observed which stabilizes after 70 h on stream to around 52%. however, dp-ceria showed significant decline in conversion from 53% to 24% in similar time span of 70 h. compared to dp-ceria, rme-ceria showed excellent activity and stability at all conditions towards the rwgs reaction. 
second, the rwgs reaction was studied for the first time in the field on catalysis over ceria-supported γ-alumina prepared via reverse microemulsion method. three catalysts were prepared at three different loadings of ceria (20 wt%, 30 wt% and 40 wt%). all the catalyst were test for the application of rwgs reaction. results confirm that 40% wt ceria-supported γ-alumina (40%ce/al) showed similar activity and stability as of unsupported rme-ceria. 40% ce/al showed very high specific surface area of 292.06 m2 gcat-1, which is almost doubled compared to what we observe for the bulk rme-ceria. sem results confirm the cluster like structure of the catalyst that leads to high porosity and high exposed surface area. long term stability test at ghsv of 10,000 ml gcat-1 h-1 showed stable 55% co2 conversion to co with 100% selectivity. finally, among all the ce/al catalyst formulations 40%ce/al catalyst appears as the optimum formulation for rwgs applications. 
in the third part of this ph.d. thesis, a thorough investigation was performed for the scope of stainless-steel reactors in the rwgs application. it was observed that at an operating temperature of above 550°c in a highly active carbonaceous environment of co-h2-h2o stainless steel undergoes severe corrosion known as metal dusting. this disintegration leads to form nanometal particles that facilitate filamentous coke formation on the steel wall. empty reactor test (without catalyst) confirms the fact that in the absence of co, stainless steel showed stable behavior (no reactivity for the incoming gas mixture of h2-co2 below 550°c and only 4% co2 conversion to co even after 90 h on stream).        
finally, suggestions for future work include the study of 40%ce/al using more advanced techniques like xps, tme, and raman spectroscopy for the in-depth surface analysis that would help to significantly enhance the activity at higher space velocities. it was also proposed that the effect of promoters like cu, co, and fe should be studied.  literature showed that these promoters significantly enhance catalyst activity at a lower temperature. conclusively,  all the catalysts (unsupported and supported) showed 100%co selectivity and stable conversion with excellent coking resistance",university of waterloo,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2306'],"[{'name': 'Iqbal, Muhammad Waqas'}]",development of a ceria-based catalyst prepared by the microemulsion method for highly selective co2 conversion via reverse water gas shift,2021,,

ii) stronger climate change impacts and associated reductions in water resources availability imply an increasing role of fossil fuels in the power mix, thus increasing ghg emissions and undermining the compliance with climate goals; iii) macroeconomic and sectoral impacts of climate change are stronger if competition for water between hydropower and the other economic sectors is not considered and if transboundary competition for water is taken into account; and iv) the impacts of climate change related reductions in water resources availability result in decreases in gross domestic product (gdp) of between -0.1% and -3.2%. hence, beyond the quantification of the economic impacts of climate/energy policies and climate-driven changes in water resources availability and competition by 2050, the analyses provide relevant insights that are of utmost importance for energy and climate policy-makingas alterações climáticas são consideradas uma das mais sérias ameaças ao mundo natural e à economia global. por essa razão, a avaliação dos impactos das alterações climáticas e a definição de políticas de mitigação têm merecido a atenção das comunidades científica e política em todo o mundo. uma das principais causas das alterações climáticas são as variações da concentração de gases com efeito de estufa (gee) na atmosfera, que são maioritariamente emitidos pelo setor energético. por outro lado, o impacto físico mais evidente das alterações climáticas é o aquecimento global, que interfere com o ciclo da água, em particular através de alterações da precipitação, e afeta a disponibilidade e a variabilidade da oferta e da procura de recursos hídricos. a água é, por sua vez, essencial na cadeia de produção do setor energético, e um input crucial para o setor elétrico – em particular, para a produção hidroelétrica. assim, o setor energético não só contribui para as alterações climáticas, como é, também, vulnerável aos seus impactos. ao mesmo tempo, o setor energético tem um significativo potencial de mitigação das alterações climáticas, nomeadamente através de aumentos de eficiência e da produção a partir de fontes renováveis, como a hidroelétrica. o objetivo global desta tese é analisar os impactos e feedbacks entre recursos hídricos, o setor energético e a economia, considerando os objetivos de energia e clima e as alterações climáticas. para o caso de portugal, país mediterrânico, a análise foca-se i) nos impactos económicos das metas fixadas pelas políticas de energia/clima em vigor e ii) nos impactos económicos da redução da disponibilidade e da competição pela água, decorrentes das alterações climáticas. os resultados mostram que: i) a forma mais custo-eficaz de alcançar objetivos de poupança de energia é através da redução do consumo de energia primária de origem fóssil, e que a forma mais custo-eficaz de alcançar objetivos de poupança de energia final é através da redução do consumo de todos os produtos (fósseis e renováveis); ii) impactos mais severos das alterações climáticas e a redução da disponibilidade de água que lhes está associada implicam um papel crescente dos combustíveis fósseis no mix elétrico, o que provoca um aumento das emissões de gee e pode pôr em causa o cumprimento de objetivos climáticos; iii) os impactos macroeconómicos e setoriais das alterações climáticas são mais fortes se a concorrência pela água entre a produção hidroelétrica e os restantes setores económicos não for considerada, e se a concorrência transfronteiriça for tida em conta; e iv) os impactos das alterações climáticas na disponibilidade de água levam a uma redução do produto interno bruto entre -0.1% e -3.2%. para além da quantificação dos impactos económicos das políticas de energia/clima e dos efeitos das alterações climáticas na disponibilidade de recursos hídricos, a análise fornece elementos relevantes para a definição de políticas de energia e climaprograma doutoral em ciências e engenharia do ambient",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/580'],"[{'name': 'Teotónio, Carla Manuela Rodrigues'}]","água, energia e economia: uma avaliação integrada dos impactos económicos das alterações climáticas num país mediterrânico",2021,,

utilizó en el lecho fijo fue ni/al2o3, el cual fue sintetizado por coprecipitación de
ni(no3)2.6h2o y al(no3)3.9h2o. la biomasa de banano se cargó en el reactor entre dos

reacción catalizada, el catalizador fue ubicado entre 2 rejillas de # 200 tyler, sobre el lecho
de biomasa. a la mezcla gaseosa resultante de la reacción (vapor recalentado y gas de
síntesis) se condeso el exceso de agua, y el gas de síntesis fue separado por separador
bifásico. finalmente, el gas de síntesis atravesó un filtro de silica gel y se recolecto en una
funda tedlar de 1l para su análisis por cromatografía de gases. los resultados del diseño
establecieron una longitud del reactor de 9 cm y 3 cm de diámetro. en la reacción no
catalizada, los componentes que se obtuvieron en mayor porcentaje fueron: dióxido de

hidrogeno > etileno > dióxido de carbono. el contenido de hidrógeno paso de 25.8% molar
a 51.8% molar al utilizar catalizador; mientras que el dióxido de carbono redujo su contenido
molar en un 50%. adicionalmente, un balance de masa y energía estableció una conversión
de 0.295 en base al vapor de agua, y un coeficiente global de transferencia de calor de 4.13

usado hacia la formación de hidrogeno y reducción de dióxido de carbonohydrogen and its production are currently an important research topic, since it is
considered a clean energy vector that can be used in thermal machines or as a fuel
without greenhouse gas emissions, which would contribute to the protection of the
environment. there are several methods that are currently being investigated for the
hydrogen production, among these the biomass gasification stands out. in general, this
latter is carried out in two stages: hydrolysis of the biomass to produce water-soluble
compounds and the reaction stage of gasification of these compounds. the use of
catalysts in the gasification of biomass favors the formation of hydrogen, as well as
reduces the formation of tar, which translates into a higher conversion of the biomass.
one of the most abundant biomass in our country is the residue from banana plantations,
whose energy potential to produce hydrogen has not yet been evaluated. due to the
aforementioned, the objective of this work was to design a bed catalytic reactor to carry
out the banana gasification. for the design of the reactor, the length and diameter were
estimated considering fluidization conditions and a ratio height/diameter of 3/1. after the
design and construction of the reactor, the catalyzed and uncatalyzed gasification
reaction was carried out at conditions of temperature of 640 °c, atmospheric pressure,
mass of banana residue of 11.75 g, particle diameter of 1.84 mm biomass, and
superheated water vapor as a gasifying agent. the catalyst used in the fixed bed was
ni/al2o3, which was synthesized by coprecipitation of ni(no3)2.6h2o and al(no3)3.9h2o.
the banana biomass was loaded into the reactor between two # 80 tyler grids, in order
to support and prevent carryover. similarly, in the catalyzed reaction, the catalyst was
placed between 2 grids of #200 tyler, on the biomass bed. the gaseous mixture resulting
from the reaction (superheated steam and synthesis gas) was condensed with excess
water, and the synthesis gas was separated by a two-phase separator. finally, the
synthesis gas passed through a silica gel filter and was collected in a 1l tedlar sleeve
for analysis by gas chromatography. the design results established a reactor length of
9 cm and 3 cm in diameter. in the uncatalyzed reaction, the components obtained in the
highest percentage were carbon dioxide> hydrogen> ethylene. on the contrary, in the
catalyzed reaction, it was obtained: hydrogen> ethylene> carbon dioxide. the hydrogen
content went from 25.8 %mol to 51.8 %mol when using a catalyst; while carbon dioxide
reduced its molar content by 50%. additionally, a mass and energy balance established
a conversion of 0.295 based on water vapor, and a global heat transfer coefficient of
4.13 w/m2k. the results of this study show the good selectivity of the used catalyst
towards the formation of hydrogen and reduction of carbon dioxideingeniero químicocuenc",universidad de cuenca,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/963'],"[{'name': 'Tacuri Sarmiento, Diego Mauricio'}]",diseño y desarrollo de reactor lecho fijo catalítico para gasificación de biomasa de banano en la producción de hidrógeno,2021,,

(1) u.s. electricity can be substantially decarbonized at a modest cost, but complete decarbonization is very costly. (2) significant expansion of solar pv and wind to combine for at least 40% of the generation mix by 2050 is fairly certain. however, solar pv and battery storage are more affected by economic and policy assumptions than wind. (3) investments in long-distance transmission are minimal, while investments in battery storage are much more significant under a wide range of assumptions. (4) optimal solutions include large investments in natural gas capacity, but gas capacity utilization rates decline steadily and significantly. (5) cost structures shift away from operating expenditures and toward capital expenditures, especially under climate policy. we conclude our article by discussing the policy implications of these findings. chapter 3 presents a bilevel programming model to aid decision-making in natural gas markets where multiple autonomous agents interact strategically, possibly with conflicting interests. in the proposed model, a liquefied natural gas (lng) operator is the leader, and a natural gas (ng) producer is the follower. the lng operator attempts to optimally locate lng export terminals, purchase gas from the ng producer, and export it as lng. the ng producer aims to optimize production, pipeline investments, and sales to domestic consumers and the lng operator. to solve the bilevel problem, we first reformulate it as a single-level problem by exploiting the lower-level problem’s convexity. then, we use disjunctive reformulations of complementarity constraints and piecewise linear approximations of objective function terms to convert the problem into a convex quadratic mixed-integer program (qmip). computational experiments confirm that the qmip is tractable and can be solved efficiently. we apply our bilevel framework to a case study of the gulf-southwest region of the united states and evaluate several decision-making scenarios. the scenario results emphasize the importance of using the bilevel methodology to anticipate the effects of new lng export facilities on ng prices across the domestic gas network. adding these large gas-consuming facilities at specific locations puts upward pressure on domestic gas prices, although this is somewhat mitigated by the ng producer’s optimal production response to the increased demand. chapter 4 presents a risk-based integer bilevel programming model that considers two players in a leader-follower setting, where each tries to maximize their individual profits. the leader or manufacturer makes decisions pertaining to facility location and the amount of raw material to buy from the supplier. the supplier or follower decides how much raw material to produce. both players face demand uncertainty in their respective markets while making investment, production, and sales decisions. we develop models for optimal decision-making under risk-neutral and risk-averse objectives and explore the effects of different risk attitudes on the problem and its optimal solution. these problems are hard to solve as the number of scenarios increase, and solving them generally involves developing customized algorithms. to find feasible solutions to the resulting stochastic bilevel problem, an algorithm is developed that iteratively solves a restricted version of the problem to obtain feasible solutions to the original problem. extensive computational experiments are performed to evaluate algorithmic tractability and solution quality. the proposed algorithm is able to find high-quality feasible solutions to the bilevel problem in a very reasonable amount of time, and the attained solutions are found to be close to the optimal solution. the methodology is demonstrated with an example that addresses strategic issues in the natural gas market. the model considers two players, the liquefied natural gas (lng) operator or leader and the natural gas (ng) producer or follower acting in a leader-follower setting. the lng operator makes decisions pertaining to the locations of lng facilities and the amount of gas to buy from the producer. the follower decides how much gas to produce. both players face demand uncertainty in their respective markets and make investments, production, and sales decisions. the case study explores the gulf-southwest region of the united states and demonstrates the impact of the risk-averse decision-making approach on investment and operational decisions. chapter 5 concludes this dissertation by summarizing the most important findings from each study and outlining valuable directions for future research.operations research and industrial engineerin",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/222'],"[{'name': 'Geetha Jayadev, Gopika'}]",optimization approaches for energy infrastructure network design,2021,,

of its availability and affordability in comparison with most energy alternatives. approximately 
17 million people in south africa live in communal lands where fuelwood can be harvested easily 
and freely by households, with 80% of the overall fuel consumed for domestic purposes extracted 
from burning fuelwood. the rapid-excess trends of fuelwood consumption – aggravated by 
population growth, agricultural and household settlement expansions – pose utmost challenges for 
community development. overharvesting of fuelwood can result in fuelwood scarcity, loss of 
biodiversity, excessive land clearance and soil erosion. 
this study evaluated the factors that influence fuelwood consumption in households at the 
thulamela local municipality. the study utilised mixed research methods, comprising 
quantitative and qualitative methods. a semi-structured questionnaire consisting of both closed 
and open-ended questions was used to collect data from the households. the collected data was 
mainly qualitative data (nominal and categorical data) and the researcher used the frequency menu 
to summarise the data and cross tabulation menu in the statistical package for social scientists

the degree of association between two categorical variables. if the p-value is less than 0.05, there 
is a significant association between variables – thus, the variables dependent on each other.
the study found that socio-economic characteristics such as monthly income, employment status, 
gender, educational level of the household head, number of employed household members, energy 
expenditure and type of occupation play a significant role in the factors that influence fuelwood 
consumption. as a result of these factors, fuelwood energy is still being used as a primary energy 
source by most households to meet their domestic needs for cooking and water heating – despite most of them being electrified. additionally, lack of environmental education, the erratic 
electricity supply and staggering living conditions which drive widespread poverty in rural areas
contribute to the extensive fuelwood consumption among households. the study highlighted the 
recommendations on mitigation measures that can be used to reduce extensive fuelwood

this thesis was executed as an assignment for wärtsilä's growth & development department. the exponentially increased objectives in the green hydrogen economy have raised the concern of whether each sector has a sufficient capacity to utilise hydrogen and what happens if green hydrogen cannot be produced as affordable as aimed. these questions point out the need for research about the potential of green hydrogen in electricity generation.

the thesis focused on reviewing and analysing the european hydrogen economy presented in the literature and commercial sources. the aim was to discover a common line between the various perspectives and assess the direction where the european hydrogen economy is most preferably heading in the long term. in this thesis, the different scenarios for using green hydrogen in electricity generation were implemented, based on which each variable's impact was assessed. also, the competitiveness of green hydrogen under different circumstances was evaluated.

the results showed that green hydrogen has a great potential to become significant long-term energy storage and fuel for electricity generation. still, it will require development in line with ambitious targets. the use of hydrogen in electricity generation is limited by technical and economic challenges. at current production prices, green hydrogen is not an attractive option to the electricity generation needs. the trend is that sectors such as industry, which currently has the highest hydrogen consumption, also will be the most significant users of green hydrogen, at least in the initial phase.yhtenä vaihtoehtona uusiutuvan energian vaihtelevan tuotannon tasapainottamiseksi ja energiasektorin päästöjen vähentämiseksi on tuottaa ja hyödyntää puhdasta, vähäpäästöistä vetyä energiasektorilla. euroopan unioni on julkaissut tavoitteensa kyseisten vetyvaihtoehtojen laajasta hyödyntämisestä tulevaisuudessa. tässä tutkimuksessa tarkasteltiin vedyn hyödyntämistä sähköntuotannossa, sen haasteita ja merkittävimpiä etuja. työn tavoite oli tarjota tietoa ja arvioita uusiutuvan vedyn markkinoista ja tulevaisuuden kehityksestä euroopassa.

työ toteutettiin wärtsilän energialiiketoiminnan euroopan growth & development osastolle. vetytalouden kunnianhimoinen kasvutavoite synnyttää huolen, onko vedyn menestymiselle edellytykset sähköntuotannossa. millaisia vaikutuksia havaitaan, jos vetyä ei pystytä tuottamaan yhtä edullisesti kuin on tavoiteltu? tällaiset kysymykset osoittivat tarpeen tutkia, millaiset hyödyntämismahdollisuudet uusiutuvalla vedyllä on sähköntuotannossa.

työssä keskityttiin kirjallisuudessa sekä kaupallisissa lähteissä esitettyjen tulosten ja arvioiden tarkasteluun ja analysointiin. tarkoituksena oli analysoida, mihin suuntaan euroopan vetymarkkinat ovat kehittymässä tulevaisuudessa. tässä työssä rakennettiin myös skenaariotutkimus, jonka perusteella analysoitiin eri muuttujien kehityksen vaikutusta vedyn kustannuksiin ja sitä kautta sen kilpailukykyyn.

tulokset osoittivat, että vihreällä vedyllä on suuri potentiaali tulla osaksi sähköntuotantoa tulevina vuosikymmeninä, mutta se vaatii kunnianhimoisten tavoitteiden mukaista kehitystä. vedyn hyödyntämistä sähköntuotannossa rajoittavat sekä teknilliset että taloudelliset haasteet. uusiutuva vety ei ole nykyisillä tuotantohinnoilla houkutteleva vaihtoehto sähköntuotannon tarpeisiin. on nähtävissä trendi, että sektorit kuten teollisuus, jossa tällä hetkellä vedyn kulutus on suurinta, tulevat olemaan merkittävimpiä uusiutuvan vedyn hyödyntäjiä lähivuosina",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/5594'],"[{'name': 'Mäkelä, Mikael Erkki Matias'}]",development of green hydrogen economy and its feasibility in electricity generation in europe,2021,,

the work was performed in collaboration with exxonmobil that first observed this phenomenon during a campaign to test the use of molten carbonate fuel cells as carbon capture devices. the work was also done in partnership with fuelcell energy, who through an agreement with exxonmobil obtained all of the experimental data of this phenomenon. 
the analysis of the mechanism and the development of a model to simulate cells working at such conditions were conducted in a series of different steps. to start, based on experimental data, the mechanism was studied as a function of the reactant gases to understand the main dependences of the occurring phenomena. consequently, as more data became available, additional dependences to improve the knowledge of the mechanism and the modeling were studied. in particular, the work was focused on the analysis of the effects that the diffusion resistance has on the extent on which one anionic path evolves over the other. successively, the operating temperature and the carbonate/hydroxide equilibrium were studied and included in the model. the analysis of the experimental data also allowed to observe the effects that the gas atmosphere can have on the cell ohmic resistance as it was determined that the electrolyte melt can change based on equilibria between melt and gas phase. the developed kinetic formulation was implemented into the simfc code, a home-made fortran program realized by the group pert of the university of genoa for the simulation of high temperature fuel cells (molten carbonate and solid oxide). in this way, the model was successfully tested by simulating the experimental data. 
additionally, a formulation to consider the direct internal steam reforming of ch4 on the performance of cells was also included into the simfc code. the formulation considers the reaction locally with dependence on catalyst loading. as such, it allows the study of the effect of catalyst distribution and degradation. this part of the thesis was developed on solid oxide fuel cells instead of molten carbonate. this choice was dictated by the fact that i spent a period of 8 months during the first year of the ph.d. program at the korea institute of science and technology studying solid oxide fuel cells materials, specifically focused on the use of perovskite (a possible solid oxide fuel cells anode material) as catalysts for the ch4 reforming reaction which will be presented.

this research investigation adopted a qualitative approach to data collection and analysis. the first phase focused on examining the vco policies and practices of the ‘top-10 uk-based airlines’ based on the content analysis of their respective website disclosures towards vco schemes. the second phase centred on analysing cl citizens’ perceptions towards air travel, first broadly, and then specifically in relation to vco schemes, by conducting thirty one-to-one semi-structured interviews with cl participants. while vco initiatives, as currently applied in commercial aviation, were found to be a feature of corporate reporting for legitimacy purposes, through this study’s focus on cl citizens’ perceptions, richer ‘empirical’ accounts of practices underpinning discretionary air travel within broader contextual infrastructures emerged. these involved both interpretations for undertaking a number of different carbon reduction behaviours, with the purpose of ‘regaining self-consistency’, and various justifications related to different explanations for not committing oneself to such behavioural changes too. 

this thesis's theoretical contribution to knowledge is twofold. first, it takes literature forward by providing a recent review of vco policies and practices adopted by airlines, in the context of csr reporting and corporate legitimacy. classifying ‘carbon literacy’, as a meta-theme of ‘green consumerism’, comprises this thesis’s second contribution to knowledge. this contribution is substantial because it calls attention to the presence of an emerging consumer segment, whose perceptions towards controversial solutions to environmental issues have not been explicitly considered beforehand. exploring the rationales behind their responses also resulted in a number of further, more practical, contributions to knowledge, which could be cautiously generalised to inform prevailing choices and influences beyond the sample, aside from reshaping the direction of future research and practice",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/35'],"[{'name': 'Velonaki, Argyro'}]","from climate change knowledge to climate change passivity:

nineteen gas samples were taken in april 2017 from methane-producing wellheads along an e-w transect perpendicular to the boundary fault in southeast qinshui basin (sqb) in northern china. the stable isotope compositions (δ13c= -35.2 to -30.2‰, δd= -194 to -155‰) indicates a thermogenic origin with limited microbial input. they are, however, lighter than expected based on coal maturity, perhaps due to adsorption/desorption fractionation during commercial gas extraction. he-ne-ar isotopes are a mixture of crustal-radiogenic gas with air-derived noble gases from groundwater. 4he concentrations (0.52 to 33.25 ppmv) and 4he/40ar* ratios (0.06–1.74) are unusually low. he-ne-ar concentrations are consistent with the open system rayleigh fractionation of noble gases derived from air-saturated water (asw) with 4he/40ar*=1 during gas extraction. the low 4he/40ar* compared with average crust (5) or local production (13) values, implies that radiogenic 4he produced in the coals was lost prior to equilibrium between gas and water phase in the reservoir. this likely occurred during rapid exhumation in cenozoic. the event may have led to the loss of up to 44% of the methane from the coal seams. the depletion of xe and kr without significant enrichment of ne suggests the strong retention of kr and xe in sqb coals.



ten cbm samples were collected in april 2018 from the four blocks containing different mature coals in liupanshui coalfield (lpc) in southern china. two gas samples were collected from the same two wells in the dahebian block in october 2018. this is the first gas geochemical work in lpc. methane is mainly thermogenic in origin based on the c1/(c2+c3) ratio (16-971), δ13cch4 (-42.9 to -34.9‰) and δdch4 (-206 to -140‰). the difference in major gas and stable isotope compositions between the four blocks of lpc is mainly due to the different extent of maturation of coals in each block. noble gases in lpc are a mixture of air-derived gases from asw with crustal gases in the reservoir. the lower proportion of nucleogenic ne and 4he/40ar* ratios in gases from qingshan block compared with other blocks implies an evident he and ne loss. the gas loss is also inferred to be the result of basin inversion. 20ne/36ar ratios (0.23-0.70) are higher than local asw (0.16), requiring a re-dissolution fractionation process similar to that proposed for co2 gas reservoirs (gilfillan et al., 2008). 84kr/36ar and 132xe/36ar ratios in lpc are mostly higher than the modelled fractionation lines. this is explained by desorption of initial trapped xe and kr in the coal matrix. the qingshan block gases contain the same depleted kr and xe pattern as sqb, suggesting the stronger adsorption capacity of local coals to kr and xe.



over 93% of he and 9% of ar budget of the coal basins is estimated to have been lost during the gas loss process. it explains the absence of mantle volatiles in the sqb and lpc cbm. this demonstrates the importance of basin inversion on gas preservation in shallow cbm and shows that the light noble gases are essential for tracing such a process",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/48'],"[{'name': 'Chen, Biying'}]",evolution of coalbed methane: insights from stable and noble gas isotopes,2021,,

the first and main component of this research entails a series of hydrothermal experiments simulating quartz cementation and grain coat development, particularly authigenic chlorite, at specific temperature steps to mimic the conditions of deeply buried reservoirs and develop predictive models for clay-coat-controlled reservoir quality in such settings. naturally-occurring sandstone samples from the lower jurassic cook formation of the oseberg field (norway) were exposed to a silica supersaturated solution for up to 360 hours at temperatures of 0–250 °c. an array of microscopic, analytical and modelling techniques was employed to track the mineralogical alterations, quantify the temperature-dependent volumetric changes of authigenic chlorite, the thickness and coverage of the clay coats, and capture the evolving reservoir quality attributes in the 2d and 3d domain. results show that grain coating chlorite is formed through a mixture of the solid-state transformation and dissolution-precipitation mechanisms from berthierine transformation, replacement of siderite and neoformation on precursor-free substrate surfaces. ceasing of porosity loss and permeability maintenance correlate directly to grain coat volume increase at temperatures higher than 175 °c.



the second component presents a series of hydrothermal experiments performed on laboratory synthesised biofilm-rich, pure sand samples to test the influence of microbial extracellular polymeric substances (eps) on early mineral precipitation at temperatures up to 120 °c. an artificial solution was used to synthesise and preserve the microbial communities and promote mineral genesis during each experimental run. textural evaluation of the samples shows that eps-coated surfaces serve as templates for the nucleation of early mineral precipitates. poorly-ordered, morphologically clay-like material developed at points of contact between quartz grains and where eps structures pre-existed.

new emission standards in accordance with the global energy policies.

within this context, the carbon dioxide capture and storage (ccs) technologies play an

important role as an accepted strategy towards the mitigation of co2 emissions. one of

the important aspects of the ccs techniques is the oxidation of natural gas under oxy-fuel

combustion conditions. however, very few scientific contributions have been devoted to

the research of these systems, so that there is a lack of understanding of the oxy-combustion processes.

the present work aims at the development and the application of an advanced numerical approach for the simulation of oxy-fuel combustion in which the tci is adequately

accounted for within non-premixed combustion regimes using the openfoam platform.

the suggested model, which is designed for both rans and les applications, consists of

a combination of a transported probability density function approach following the eulerian stochastic field methodology and the flamelet progress variable (fpv) chemistry

reduction mechanism. in the les framework, the proposed method accurately represents the effect of the sub-grid fluctuations on the flame structure and on combustion

characteristics, along with the interaction between turbulence and chemistry.

the implemented developed combustion model is first verified, and then validated and

applied to different turbulent non-premixed combustion configurations featuring an in-

creasing order of complexity. in particular, sandia flame d, which consists of a turbulent

piloted methane-air jet flame, is first employed for model validation in both rans

and les contexts. the next flames are more challenging cases, namely the non-premixed

sandia oxy-flame series (a & b), which are operated under different re numbers and

characterized by various co2 and h2 enrichments in the oxidizer and fuel streams, respectively. all investigated cases are well documented with available experimental

measurements.

in this work, developments are presented, which address the most important of these shortcomings subject to the constraint to obtain low- and linear-scaling electronic-structure methods. a scheme combining an elegant way to introduce local orbitals and multi-node parallelism is put forward, which not only allows to evaluate the rpa correlation energy in a fraction of the time of former theories, but also enables a scalable decrease of the high memory requirements. furthermore, a quadratic-scaling self-consistent minimization of the total rpa energy with respect to the one-particle density matrix in the atomic-orbital space is introduced, making the rpa energy variationally stable and independent of the quality of the reference calculation. to address the slow convergence with respect to the size of the basis set and the self-correlation inherent in the rpa functional, range-separation of the electron-electron interaction is exploited for atomic-orbital rpa, yielding a linear-scaling range-separated rpa method with consistent performance over a broad range of chemical problems. as a natural extension, the concepts including local orbitals, self-consistency, and range-separation are further combined in a rpa-based generalized kohn–sham method, which not only shows a balanced performance in general main group thermochemistry, kinetics, and noncovalent interactions, but also yields accurate ionization potentials and fundamental gaps. 

the origin of the self-correlation error within rpa lies in the neglect of exchange-effects in the calculation of the interacting density-density response functions. while range-separation is a reasonable approach to counteract this shortcoming — since self-correlation is pronounced at short interelectronic distances — a more rigorous but computationally sophisticated approach is to introduce the missing exchange-effects, at least to some extent. to make rpa with exchange methods applicable to systems containing hundreds of atoms and hence a suitable choice for practical applications, a framework is developed, which allows to devise highly efficient low- and linear-scaling rpa with exchange methods. 

the developments presented in this work, however, are not only limited to rpa and beyond-rpa methods. the connection between rpa and many-body perturbation theory is further used to present a second-order møller–plesset perturbation theory method, which combines the tools to obtain low- and linear-scaling rpa and beyond-rpa methods with efficient linear-algebra routines, making it highly efficient and applicable to large molecular systems comprising several thousand of basis functions",ludwig-maximilians-universität münchen,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/332'],"[{'name': 'Graf, Daniel'}]",development of efficient electronic-structure methods based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem and møller–plesset perturbation theory,2021,,

for germany to achieve its ambitious political targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas
emissions in the electricity sector, major energy scenarios and reports project that the
country will have to expand its renewable power generation capacities massively by 2035. as
is the case for many countries, germany will have to heavily rely on variable renewable
energy sources (vres), especially wind and solar photovoltaics. the characteristics of power
production from vres pose challenges for a stable and reliable future power supply system.
accordingly, the research into the technical challenges of integrating large shares of vres
into the power system has therefore attracted much interest in recent years; however,
major energy scenarios seem to not cover integration options associated with the fast
development of vres correctly and lag behind the fast development in renewable energy
technology.
in this cumulative thesis, selected technical options for the integration of renewable energy
sources into the power supply system have been investigated in a case study of germany
and a selected transmission system in germany. to identify and assess these emerging
integration options, the research in this phd thesis covers the most promising technical
options for the integration of vres in the form of i) system-friendly layouts of wind and solar
pv; ii) optimal capacity mixes of vres; iii) the spatial allocation of wind turbines and the
impact assessment of wind turbine allocation; and iv) the contribution of flexible power
generation from biomass to complement vres. therefore, a mix of methods has been
applied, ranging from numerical optimization based on time series data, gis potential
mapping and allocation including a multi-criterial decision analysis.
the results show how the investigated options can facilitate the transition for a power
supply system dominated by high shares of vres in the near to medium term. a faster
energy transition with significantly reduced overall vres power generation capacities, less
excess energy (ee) generation, improved cross-sectorial energy provision and flexible
bioenergy as a complement to vres are the major findings of the investigated options in this

soil nutrients, have increased research attention towards the crop’s adoption as a potential food security and economic empowerment crop for south africa. widely consumed as food and livestock feed, cassava starch also has potential industrial applications in pharmaceuticals, specialty chemicals (e.g. succinic acid), ethanol, adhesive, and food derivatives (e.g. glucose syrup). commercialization of industrial cassava starch facilities (csf) depends on profitability and sustainable energy supply for operations. residues generated by csfs [cassava starch wastewater (cww), bagasse (cb)], and cassava stalks (cs) could generate the requisite energy for cassava starch industries (csi), thus there is potential to integrate waste-based bioenergy developments with csfs. cassava waste biorefineries (cwbs) for co-producing energy and high-value bio-products have been proposed as potential solutions to energy and cost limitations in csfs. attributed to knowledge gaps on the techno-economic feasibility (tef) and long-term sustainability (economic + environmental + social) of such cwbs, conventional waste management schemes involve the burning of cs and anaerobic digestion of cww & cb to produce biogas for starch drying heat, with the digestate being disposed into watercourses. this research, through aspen plus® process/economic modelling and simapro simulation, investigated the tef and sustainability of cwbs in the south african socio-economic context, with an overall objective of contributing to knowledge towards the commercialization of cwbs. the investigated cwb scenarios include: (i) enhanced waste resource recoveries (energy, biofertilizer, water) through integrating cs into csf waste treatment, and (ii) advanced cwbs [(i) combined heat & power, with (ii) hexose-bioethanol, (iii) pentose & hexose-bioethanol, (iv) pentose-bioethanol + glucose syrup, and (v) pentose-bioethanol + succinic acid)]. the results showed that combined treatment of cs (14.32 t/h) with csf wastes (7.29 t/h dm cb + 377.83 t/h cww) could ensure further resource recoveries, including bioelectricity (up to 31.96 mw), liquid/solid biofertilizer, and usable water, with potential energy self-sufficiency and economic enhancements for csis. co-conversion of 450.89 t/h cs and csf waste could ensure sufficient energy supplies for both cwbs and csfs, plus 300 mw electricity (i), or 287 mw + 1.48 t/h bioethanol (ii), or 121 mw + 8.95 t/h bioethanol (iii), or 164 mw + 5.72 t/h bioethanol + 9.29 t/h glucose syrup (iv), or 161 mw + 5.72 t/h bioethanol + 6.9 t/h succinic acid (v). however, only scenarios (i)-(ii) demonstrated economic viability, while (iii)-(v) favor environmental sustainability. revitalizing the csi’s via integrations with the resource recovery schemes, where the recoveries are re-used in the csfs and crop cultivations, could ensure viable circular economy strategies that may enhance sustainable industrial developments. hence, integrating csfs with resource recoveries or chp (i) or chp + hexose-bioethanol (ii) represent viable strategies for the synergetic advancement of food-energy security and low-carbon economies.afrikaanse opsomming: kassawagewas se hoë styselopbrengs, gepaardgaande met sy toleransie vir droogte/lae grondvoedingstowwe, het navorsingaandag op die gewas se aanneming as ’n potensiële

con este trabajo de monografía se pretende realizar un análisis de los catalizadores más utilizados en la pirólisis de biomasa para la producción de hidrógeno y evaluar su eficiencia, con el fin de generar un documento que sirva de referente para la optimización del proceso de pirólisis de biomasa y ofrezca un amplio nivel de investigación en esta área, la cual se encuentra en auge a partir del siglo xxi. para cumplir con este objetivo, el proyecto contempla la búsqueda de literatura especializada relacionada con el tema, realizando un análisis de los artículos científicos publicados durante el 2010 al 2020, y que hacen parte de las bases de datos academic search premier, proquest, sciencedirect y scopus, así como también, libros electrónicos de la base de datos ebooks collection, entre otros documentos.humanity has made an excessive use of fossil fuels, which has plunged the planet into levels of pollution unprecedented in history due to the production of co2, co, sox, nxoy among other greenhouse gases. day after day, scientists from various regions of the planet warn about how the concentration of polluting gases is about to reach a point of no return. likewise, they are working on developing innovative sources of clean energy, which replace the current fossil fuels whose environmental repercussions are significantly negative.
an alternative to solve this problem is the treatment of biomass to obtain molecules with energy applications. biomass, subjected to different chemical and physical processes, can produce energy and raw materials as platform molecules in various chemical applications. through pyrolysis, biomass is transformed into clean energy and substances such as phenol and furfural, which are very useful in chemical synthesis and which were traditionally produced only from oil, carbon capacitors or products like hydrogen are currently seen as future energy alternatives, but which production relies mainly in the water gas shift of natural gas and because of that there is a need for developing more sustainable processes. the purpose of this monograph, is to carry out an analysis of the most used catalysts in the pyrolysis of biomass for the production of hydrogen and to evaluate their efficiency, in order to provide a document that serves as a reference for the optimization of the pyrolysis process of biomass and offer a wide level of research in this area that has been booming since the 21st century. to achieve this objective, the project contemplates the search for specialized literature related to the subject, carrying out an analysis of the scientific articles published from 2010 to 2020, and that are part of the academic search premier, proquest, sciencedirect and scopus, as well as electronic books from the ebooks collection database, among other documents",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2069'],"[{'name': 'Peñaranda Carrillo, Pedro Pablo'}]",análisis de la eficiencia de catalizadores heterogéneos usados en la valoración de biomasa mediante el proceso de pirólisis para la obtención de hidrógeno,2021,,

my perspective on energy policy and governance is broad and i analyse various arenas where energy issues are debated. these include the finnish parliament and helsinki city council, the media and discussions amongst various actors attempting to influence energy policy and working at the science-policy interface. in my analysis, i show how finnish energy policy actors are broadly committed to a sociotechnical imaginary of carbon neutrality, or a collectively held and publicly performed vision of a desirable future. in the imaginary, finland is envisioned as a prosperous welfare society that has addressed climate change by attaining a balance between greenhouse gas emissions and removals. the imaginary of carbon neutrality is broad and interpretatively flexible, thus accommodating diverse views on what carbon neutrality can entail.

in the articles that comprise this dissertation, i engage with a wide range of literature from science and technology studies, sociotechnical transitions studies, social scientific studies on energy, institutional theory and analyses on science-society relations. specifically in the thesis summary, i address a research gap within the literature on sociotechnical imaginaries, by examining how questions regarding scale, heterogeneity and mobility shape the co-production of imaginaries as well as enable and curtail the scope of agency. i build on a constructivist and interpretative approach to research and use a range of materials, such as interviews, documents, news articles, parliamentary and city council transcripts, press releases and participant observation. empirically, i focus on the 2010s as the decade when a sociotechnical imaginary of carbon neutrality emerged and became consolidated in finland.

in this thesis, i argue that sociotechnical imaginaries, in this case carbon neutrality, form the imaginative foundations of national policy debates that motivate and justify action, while simultaneously retaining  space for negotiation on how to attain those futures. the empirical analysis demonstrates that there is no overarching consensus in finland over what carbon neutrality means and what practices it allows for. i demonstrate that the context where an imaginary is co-produced both enables and constrains the scope of possible political debate and action by requiring actors to formulate their views through interpretations of desirable pathways towards carbon neutrality.

i conclude that carbon neutrality is likely to persist as a widely shared sociotechnical imaginary in finland due to the political possibilities for debate and compromise that it offers. at the same time, i propose that the concept of carbon neutrality will be increasingly challenged by questioning whose imaginary is it, what type of practices does it enable and how are different actions evaluated as carbon neutral. likewise new concepts, such as climate emergency, are likely to challenge the imaginary of carbon neutrality. i conclude that such debates are both necessary and desirable as we collectively face, address and learn to live with climate change.tarkastelen tässä väitöstutkimuksessa suomalaista energiapolitiikkaa ja sen muutostarpeita koskevia yhteiskunnallisia keskusteluja. suomessa on yhtäältä vahvat poliittiset sitoumukset toimia ilmastonmuutoksen hillitsemiseksi, toisaalta vakaat, muutosvastarintaisinakin pidetyt yhteiskunnalliset järjestelmät. tästä asetelmasta käsin on mielenkiintoista tarkastella väitteitä muutoksen tarpeesta.

näkökulmani energiapolitiikkaan ja -hallintaan on laaja, ja tarkastelen useita eri foorumeita, joissa keskustellaan energiasta ja energiapolitiikasta. osoitan, että energiapolitiikan eri tahoilla on yhteinen näkemys toivotusta tulevaisuudesta, jossa suomi on saavuttanut hiilineutraaliuden. tämä muodostaa sosioteknisen kuvitelman, eli jaetun ja julkisesti esitetyn näkemyksen tavoittelemisen arvoisesta tulevaisuudesta. kuvitelmassa suomi nähdään menestyvänä hyvinvointivaltiona, joka on vastannut ilmastonmuutokseen saavuttamalla tasapainon tuotettujen ja ilmakehästä sidottujen kasvihuonekaasupäästöjen välillä. samaan aikaan hiilineutraaliuden kuvitelma on tulkinnallisesti joustava ja mahdollistaa lukuisia eri näkemyksiä siitä, mitä hiilineutraalius yksityiskohtaisesti pitää sisällään.

väitöstutkimukseni empiiriset artikkelit tuottavat uutta tietoa hyödyntäen muiden muassa tieteen- ja teknologiantutkimusta, sosioteknisten järjestelmien tutkimusta, yhteiskuntatieteellistä energiatutkimusta, instituutioteorioita sekä tieteen ja politiikan vuorovaikutuksen tutkimusta. tarkastelemalla sosioteknisten kuvitelmien tasoja, moninaisuutta ja liikkuvuutta osoitan, miten sosiotekniset kuvitelmat sekä mahdollistavat että rajoittavat toimijuutta. nojaan tutkimuksessa konstruktionistiseen ja tulkinnalliseen metodologiaan sekä hyödynnän laajoja tutkimusaineistoja (esimerkiksi haastatteluja, uutisartikkeleita ja poliittisia puheita). tarkastelu ajoittuu 2010-luvulle – vuosikymmeneen, jolloin hiilineutraaliuden kuvitelma nousi ja vakiintui suomessa.

keskeinen väitteeni on, että sosiotekniset kuvitelmat, tässä tapauksessa hiilineutraaliuden kuvitelma, luovat perustan kansallisille keskusteluille tavoittelemisen arvoisesta tulevaisuudesta. vaikka hiilineutraaliuden kuvitelma on suomessa jaettu, maassa ei vallitse jaettua näkemystä siitä, mitä hiilineutraalius tarkoittaa ja minkälaisia käytäntöjä se mahdollistaa. tulkinnallisesti väljä kuvitelma jättääkin tilaa keskustelulle erilaisista keinoista ja käytännöistä mielekkään tulevaisuuden saavuttamiseksi.

tutkimukseni osoittaa, että hiilineutraalius tulee todennäköisesti säilymään laajasti hyväksyttynä sosioteknisenä kuvitelmana suomessa, koska se mahdollistaa sekä poliittisen keskustelun että kompromissien hakemisen. samaan aikaan hiilineutraalius tullaan haastamaan eri suunnilta: kenen kuvitelma hiilineutraalius on, minkälaisia toimia se mahdollistaa ja miten eri toimia arvotetaan hiilineutraaleiksi? tällaiset keskustelut ja haasteet ovat sekä olennaisia että toivottuja oppiessamme elämään ja toimimaan ilmastonmuutoksen kanssa",university of helsinki libraries,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/555'],"[{'name': 'Karhunmaa, Kamilla'}]",imagining energy transitions : carbon neutrality in finland,2021,,

i conclude that carbon neutrality is likely to persist as a widely shared sociotechnical imaginary in finland due to the political possibilities for debate and compromise that it offers. at the same time, i propose that the concept of carbon neutrality will be increasingly challenged by questioning whose imaginary is it, what type of practices does it enable and how are different actions evaluated as carbon neutral. likewise new concepts, such as climate emergency, are likely to challenge the imaginary of carbon neutrality. i conclude that such debates are both necessary and desirable as we collectively face, address and learn to live with climate change.tarkastelen tässä väitöstutkimuksessa suomalaista energiapolitiikkaa ja sen muutostarpeita koskevia yhteiskunnallisia keskusteluja. suomessa on yhtäältä vahvat poliittiset sitoumukset toimia ilmastonmuutoksen hillitsemiseksi, toisaalta vakaat, muutosvastarintaisinakin pidetyt yhteiskunnalliset järjestelmät. tästä asetelmasta käsin on mielenkiintoista tarkastella väitteitä muutoksen tarpeesta.

näkökulmani energiapolitiikkaan ja -hallintaan on laaja, ja tarkastelen useita eri foorumeita, joissa keskustellaan energiasta ja energiapolitiikasta. osoitan, että energiapolitiikan eri tahoilla on yhteinen näkemys toivotusta tulevaisuudesta, jossa suomi on saavuttanut hiilineutraaliuden. tämä muodostaa sosioteknisen kuvitelman, eli jaetun ja julkisesti esitetyn näkemyksen tavoittelemisen arvoisesta tulevaisuudesta. kuvitelmassa suomi nähdään menestyvänä hyvinvointivaltiona, joka on vastannut ilmastonmuutokseen saavuttamalla tasapainon tuotettujen ja ilmakehästä sidottujen kasvihuonekaasupäästöjen välillä. samaan aikaan hiilineutraaliuden kuvitelma on tulkinnallisesti joustava ja mahdollistaa lukuisia eri näkemyksiä siitä, mitä hiilineutraalius yksityiskohtaisesti pitää sisällään.

väitöstutkimukseni empiiriset artikkelit tuottavat uutta tietoa hyödyntäen muiden muassa tieteen- ja teknologiantutkimusta, sosioteknisten järjestelmien tutkimusta, yhteiskuntatieteellistä energiatutkimusta, instituutioteorioita sekä tieteen ja politiikan vuorovaikutuksen tutkimusta. tarkastelemalla sosioteknisten kuvitelmien tasoja, moninaisuutta ja liikkuvuutta osoitan, miten sosiotekniset kuvitelmat sekä mahdollistavat että rajoittavat toimijuutta. nojaan tutkimuksessa konstruktionistiseen ja tulkinnalliseen metodologiaan sekä hyödynnän laajoja tutkimusaineistoja (esimerkiksi haastatteluja, uutisartikkeleita ja poliittisia puheita). tarkastelu ajoittuu 2010-luvulle – vuosikymmeneen, jolloin hiilineutraaliuden kuvitelma nousi ja vakiintui suomessa.

keskeinen väitteeni on, että sosiotekniset kuvitelmat, tässä tapauksessa hiilineutraaliuden kuvitelma, luovat perustan kansallisille keskusteluille tavoittelemisen arvoisesta tulevaisuudesta. vaikka hiilineutraaliuden kuvitelma on suomessa jaettu, maassa ei vallitse jaettua näkemystä siitä, mitä hiilineutraalius tarkoittaa ja minkälaisia käytäntöjä se mahdollistaa. tulkinnallisesti väljä kuvitelma jättääkin tilaa keskustelulle erilaisista keinoista ja käytännöistä mielekkään tulevaisuuden saavuttamiseksi.

tutkimukseni osoittaa, että hiilineutraalius tulee todennäköisesti säilymään laajasti hyväksyttynä sosioteknisenä kuvitelmana suomessa, koska se mahdollistaa sekä poliittisen keskustelun että kompromissien hakemisen. samaan aikaan hiilineutraalius tullaan haastamaan eri suunnilta: kenen kuvitelma hiilineutraalius on, minkälaisia toimia se mahdollistaa ja miten eri toimia arvotetaan hiilineutraaleiksi? tällaiset keskustelut ja haasteet ovat sekä olennaisia että toivottuja oppiessamme elämään ja toimimaan ilmastonmuutoksen kanssa",university of helsinki libraries,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/555'],"[{'name': 'Karhunmaa, Kamilla'}]",imagining energy transitions : carbon neutrality in finland,2021,,

rochas carbonáticas ainda não são completamente entendidos. sendo assim, o objetivo desse trabalho é investigar experimentalmente os fenômenos gerados a partir do escoamento de fluido reativo, em dois tipos de rochas carbonáticas, uma que não passou por diagênese e uma que passou por processos diagenéticos, análogas aos carbonatos encontrados no pré-sal. utilizou-se uma amostra que não passou pelos processos diagenéticos, proveniente da patagonia chilena (tp3 c base) que se formou em um contexto geológico similar ao contexto geológico de formação dos carbonatos do pré-sal. além disso, utilizou-se outra amostra, que passou por processos diagenéticos, proveniente do poço fragata localizado na bacia de campos (6-dev-18parjs 5099.280). durante os ensaios foram alterados parâmetros como pressão e salinidade do fluido de injeção. antes e após o escoamento, as amostras foram caracterizadas morfologicamente por microtomografia computadorizada de raios x (micro-ct), difração de raios x

the disposal of this gas according to the environmental regulations, stimulate researches on the use of co2 for enhanced oil recovery by wag (water alternating gas) or co2 geological trapping (ccs) in carbonate rocks. the wag technique is one of many enhanced oil recovery techniques, and consists of the injection of water and carbon dioxide in order to change the petrophysical properties in the rock, due to the reactive phenomena. these phenomena could be precipitation and / or dissolution. however, those reactions in carbonate rocks are not yet fully understood. thus, the aim of this work is to investigate experimentally the reactions generated from the flow of reactive fluid in two types of carbonate rocks, one that hasn't been through any diagenetic process and one that has been through diagenetic processes, samples that fit as analogues to those carbonates found in the pre-salt region. a sample that hasn't been through diagenesis from chilean patagonia (tp3 c base) was used. this sample was generated in a geological context similar to the geological context of formation of the pre-salt carbonates. in addition, another sample was used, a sample that has been through the diagenetic processes, from the fragata well located in the campos basin (6-dev-18pa-rjs 5099.280). during the tests, parameters such as pressure and salinity of the injection fluid were changed. before and after the flow, the samples were morphologically characterized by x-ray computed microtomography (microct), x-ray diffraction (xrd) and scanning electron microscopy (sem-eds) in order to obtain information about the physical and chemicals changes in the samples between tests. in addition, the reactive fluids were analyzed by ph and icp-oes. the tests were conducted in a continuous flow reactor at a flow rate of 1 ml / min and 60 ºc temperature. the results showed changes in the samples, caused by the variation of the parameters. in this work, it was demonstrated that, in addition to the dissolution and precipitation reactions, the migration of fine grains during the test caused changes in the structure of the samples. the tests showed that salinity is an important parameter when it comes to reactive flow, increasing the porosity by 4.79% in the tp3 c-base sample. the sample 6-dev-18pa-rjs 5099.280 showed higher mineral stability and less dissolution. for this sample, the highest increase in porosity was 0.17%. the experimental tests of reactive flow in the carbonate facies used in this work are important, since they provide information that can be applied to understand the reactive reactions that can occur in the pre-salt carbonates. the data can be used for the development of mathematical models that simulate the reactive transport in these types of rocks for the purposes of ccs, wag, or even to understand what were the impacts that the diagenetic processes, that occurred at the low temperature and pressure, had over the reservoir's

from a practical standpoint, the combustion of liquids includes multiple interwoven processes, such as the gradual breakup of large liquid structures into small droplets, the dispersion and evaporation of these droplets, the mixture formation and the subsequent combustion process. with respect to technical applications, all of these processes generally occur under the influence of turbulence, a chaotic, strongly unsteady process, which involves a broad spectrum of time and length scales. the better understanding of these processes is crucial to reach the goals mentioned above. numerical simulations, beside experimental investigations, play a key role in improving this understanding. 

in this work, the large eddy simulation (les) approach is used and further developed to investigate turbulent spray combustion systems while consistently considering the turbulence-chemistry-droplets interaction processes. the les is combined with a tabulated chemistry approach to represent the detailed kinetics of the combustion reaction. 

beside the development of an interface to efficiently apply chemistry tabulation strategies within the finite volume code openfoam, the present work implements and investigates two different approaches to model the interaction of the turbulence and chemistry in the context of les: the artificially thickened flame (atf) model and the eulerian stochastic field (esf) method. the methodologies are rigorously verified and validated, first in simple test-cases and then in turbulent single phase turbulent combustion. it is shown that the modeling framework is able to reproduce experimental measurements with great accuracy. the final step in this ladder of gradually increasing complexity is to apply the respective frameworks to spray combustion. thereby, the multiphase system is treated using a two-way coupled euler-lagrange approach.

 for the liquid phase treatment, two novel approaches to represent the interaction of droplets with a thickened flame are proposed and evaluated. by taking into account the relative orientation of flame front and droplet movement using the proposed projection correction method, the overall consistency of the modeling framework is improved. additionally, a novel strategy to compute turbulent spray combustion based on the esf method coupled to the chemistry tabulation strategy is proposed. its predictive capability is demonstrated and it is shown that this novel approach has great potential to evaluate classical turbulence-chemistry interaction models.

therefore, the developed methodologies constitute a significant achievement towards predictive simulations of spray combustion",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/381'],"[{'name': 'Dreßler, Louis Jons'}]",towards predictive large-eddy-simulation-based modeling of reactive multiphase flows using tabulated chemistry,2021,,

balanço energético nacional. contudo, a produção de eletricidade baseada em fer apresenta o 
impasse da sazonalidade na disponibilidade e a forma mais adequada para garantir a segurança

energy storage systems integrated into concentrating solar power (csp) plants can enhance dispatchability and solar-to-electricity efficiency. besides, the combination of dispatchable csp plants with lower cost photovoltaic (pv) plants exploits synergies between the reliability of csp with energy storage and cost of pv. however, this integration leads to complex interactions between the different technologies and requires sophisticated design guidelines to achieve low costs and high dispatchability simultaneously.

in this thesis, a two-stage multi-objective optimisation framework for the design and operation of hybrid csp-pv plants with energy storage is developed. the two-stage optimisation simultaneously optimises the design and operation of a hybrid solar power plant with respect to competing technical and financial performances.
the multi-objective operational optimisation stage finds the best operational strategy of a hybrid power plant with energy storage systems. the model, written in python, uses a typical meteorological year to optimise one-year hourly operation. the results demonstrate that the integration of an energy storage system in a concentrating solar power plant provides dispatchability and, when hybridised with photovoltaic, enhances its competitiveness with current electricity prices. the low mismatch between supply and demand, even when a fixed commitment is required throughout the year, together with high overall efficiency, indicates that the integration of energy storage in hybrid solar power plants is an opportunity to increase the penetration of solar energy in the power sector.

the design of reliable and cost-competitive hybrid solar power plants requires the careful balancing of trade-offs between financial and technical performance. hence, the design optimisation stage optimises the capacities of the main components of the hybrid power plant and handles financial and technical objectives.
different configurations are analysed as case studies throughout the thesis to analyse the impacts, interactions, and synergies of technology integration. three locations are investigated, which present different solar resource profiles: seville (spain), tonopah (usa), and the atacama desert (chile).

the optimisation results are used to develop some guidelines for the optimal design of dispatchable hybrid solar power plants with energy storage based on the given solar resource and required dispatchability. these guidelines provide an initial design for affordable and dispatchable hybrid solar power plants and can enable their widespread deployment.

the model developed can be applied to other locations under different input parameters and demand profiles. besides, the flexibility of the model allows it to be extended in order to evaluate different energy conversion and storage technologies to design hybrid power plants with energy storage under different configurations and requirements. thus, the optimisation framework can provide valuable information for the integration of different technologies to support the affordable and sustainable transition to a clean energy system",the university of edinburgh,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/39'],"[{'name': 'Bravo Vargas, Ruben'}]",modelling and optimisation of solar power plants with energy storage systems,2021,,

un sistema para la alimentación del combustible constituido por una tolva y un tornillo sin fin; un sistema de alimentación y mezcla de gases y evaporación de agua; y en un sistema de extracción de los gases de combustión y recolección de sólidos. para la puesta en marcha de la instalación se determinó la altura de la zona de reacción para un tiempo de residencia de las partículas determinado, se calibró el sistema de alimentación para cada uno de los combustibles utilizados, se seleccionó el caudal de quench apropiado para llevar a cabo las pruebas y se caracterizó el perfil de temperatura en el interior del reactor.en el reactor de flujo arrastrado se caracterizaron corrientes de partículas de tres carbones distintos. dos de los carbones fueron la antracita nacional y la mezcla subbituminosa ya utilizadas en los análisis termo- gravimétricos. sin embargo, se sustituyó el carbón subbituminoso importado por un carbón bituminoso también importado. esta sustitución vino motivada por la intención de analizar un carbón de rango intermedio y menos reactivo que el anterior. el contenido de agua en la atmósfera quedó limitado a una fracción máxima del 40 %vol. debido a motivos técnicos relacionados especialmente con la aparición de condensaciones en zonas críticas que ocasionaban bloqueos del combustible. en este reactor, se llevaron a cabo dos tipos de pruebas, pruebas de ignición y pruebas de combustión. las pruebas de ignición para cada carbón (9 pruebas) se efectuaron bajo: atmósferas de oxicombustión (o2/co2), con un exceso de oxígeno de 1.25, contenidos en o2 del 21 y 35 %vol., y contenidos del 0, 10, 25 y 40 %vol. de h2o, así como; una atmósfera de aire (21/79 %vol. de o2/n2). mientras que, las pruebas de combustión (13 para cada carbón) se llevaron a cabo con atmósferas de oxicombustión (o2/co2) con un exceso de oxígeno de 1.25, tres porcentajes de o2 distintos (21, 30 y 35 %vol.) y fracciones de sustitución del co2 por h2o de 0, 10, 25 y 40 %vol. también se analizó el efecto independiente del exceso de oxígeno, para excesos de 1.35 y 1.45 mediante algunos ensayos adicionales para las atmósferas secas (6 pruebas con cada carbón). para la definición de las condiciones de la prueba y el cálculo posterior de los correspondientes índices se realizaron una serie de cálculos, que fueron desarrollados en el software engineering equation solver (ees).finalmente, entre las opciones que se presentan para llevar a cabo la transición del uso del carbón hacia tecnologías más limpias, se encuentra la sustitución del carbón por biomasa en las centrales térmicas. esta opción, resulta aún más cautivadora si se combina con tecnologías de captura de co2 ya que se pueden llegar a obtener emisiones negativas. a medio camino entre el uso de carbón y su sustitución completa por biomasa, se encuentra la cocombustión de carbón y biomasa, que presenta menos dificultades a la hora de implementar el cambio de combustible en las centrales ya existentes. para finalizar la tesis, en el último capítulo se analiza el efecto del vapor de agua, en concentraciones superiores a las típicas de recirculación húmeda de gases, en condiciones de cocombustión. con este propósito, se llevaron a cabo pruebas de oxicombustión en el reactor de flujo arrastrado con dos mezclas de combustible: pélets de pino y residuo de poda de vid, mezclados con el carbón bituminoso. estas pruebas se llevaron a cabo con un exceso de oxígeno de 1.25, para el 21 y 35 % de o2, y sustituyendo el co2 por contenidos de vapor de agua del 0, 10, 25 y 40 % vol. (13 pruebas para cada una de las mezclas de combustible).con este trabajo se ha completado la investigación experimental más exhaustiva realizada hasta la fecha, en relación con los trabajos disponibles en bibliografía, de la combustión de combustibles sólidos pulverizados en atmósferas de oxicombustión con altas concentraciones de vapor de agua. los principales resultados y aportaciones se resumen en el siguiente apartado. <br /","universidad de zaragoza, prensas de la universidad",['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/5956'],"[{'name': 'Escudero Oriol, Ana Iris'}, {'name': 'Diez Pinilla, Luis Ignacio'}, {'name': 'Mayoral Gastón, Maria Carmen'}]",caracterización experimental de la hidroxicombustión de combustibles sólidos pulverizados,2021,,

in this work, cfd predicted the gas-phase mass transfer performance of structured packings, and several key observations resulted. after a model for turbulence-aided mass transfer was identified with pipe flow simulations, the gas-phase mass transfer performance of a traditional structured packing was predicted. the mass transfer coefficients from cfd showed a five percent deviation compared to experimental data, validating the simulations. a geometry investigation determined the impact of three fundamental structured packing parameters on the packing performance. improved mass transfer performance often occurred at the cost of hydrodynamic performance. turbulence had a large impact on the gas-phase predictions.

the liquid-phase mass transfer in structured packings was also simulated. a novel simulation methodology enabled the structured packing performance predictions. to validate the hydrodynamic predictions from the cfd simulations, the predicted liquid holdup was compared to experimental liquid holdup data and showed a deviation of six percent. comparisons of the predicted liquid flow angle and friction factor to analytical expressions further validated the hydrodynamic cfd predictions. the liquid mass transfer coefficient predictions were validated with experimental data, having a deviation of eight percent, as well as with semi-empirical models. a structured packing geometry study was conducted for the liquid-phase performance, and liquid upheaval near packing crimps significantly contributed to the chemical separation. 

a novel interfacial mass transfer model was developed for multiphase cfd simulations. this model can handle concentration jumps of multiple orders of magnitude across the gas-liquid interface. an analytical solution to a two-dimensional system validated the cfd predictions, producing an error of less than one percent. the model was adapted for turbulent conditions and was demonstrated on a structured packing system.chemical engineerin",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/222'],"[{'name': 'Macfarlan, Luke Howard'}]",predictions of the mass transfer in structured packings using computational fluid dynamics,2021,,

the modelling tools currently available. extrapolating to reactor relevant conditions requires

this work begins by identifying steady state plasma equilibria and applying empirical limits

to characterise the available parameter space for a given machine design and scale. this

is done with a consistent calculation of the neoclassical currents, allowing for the auxiliary

current drive requirements to be determined. a baseline scenario was identified with a major

radius of 2.5m and fusion power of 1.1gw. an important result found is that a minimum

current drive efficiency is required given the empirical limits used. neutral beam injection was

found to have a sufficient current drive efficiency, with 94mw of power needed to drive all

the required current. the validity of reduced physics neutral beam models was also examined

and it was found that reasonable predictions were made provided the beams were aligned with

the magnetic field.

the performance of a tokamak is generally limited by the turbulent transport so the linear

gyrokinetic stability of a baseline st reactor plasma scenario was investigated. the baseline

equilibrium showed some desirable properties as the electron scale turbulence was found to

be stable. in the ion scale, kinetic ballooning modes and micro-tearing modes were found

 the continued rise in the concentration of co2 in the earth’s atmosphere driven by society’s rising standard of living and continued reliance on carbon-containing fossil fuels has led to several significant environmental challenges, which will continue to face humanity in the coming decades and centuries. developing technological solutions to accelerate the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and curtail the effects of climate change will continue to serve one of the critical directions society will pursue to combat these effects. the capture of co2 from point sources like coal-fired power plants will likely be a direction for the short and long-term reduction in emissions needed to stabilize the environment. with this in mind, developing technologies to serve this purpose with the least impact on people’s way of life serves as a critical challenge over the coming decades. 
the removal of co2 from point sources has been an area of interest for a number of years now, with absorption technology appears best suited to make an immediate impact with pilot and full-scale plants currently being built. in the future, methods of separating and capturing co2 will look to technologies with the potential to be considerably lower energy requirements, like adsorption and membranes, and these are still in the early stages of development. while these approaches lag behind absorption in technology readiness for co2 capture today, the potential impact of their adoption in terms of cost reduction has led to considerable research investment in developing new materials and processes to enable their application. in this dissertation, a novel strategy is proposed, and materials are developed to enable the proposed process for post-combustion co2 capture from coal. as part of this dissertation, four objectives were pursued to understand and enable this process. xxvii i) a process model was created and studied to develop a deeper understanding of the approach’s potential and the necessary materials developments to enable it. ii) promising materials were synthesized and manufactured into ready-made devices for bench-scale testing. iii) fundamental challenges of adsorptive separations related to heat management were considered in detail, and a novel manufacturing approach was developed to enable improvement in materials performance. iv) the potential of fiber sorbents for sub-ambient co2 capture was examined through the operation of single bed psa cycles using the manufactured materials from previous objectives. 
the first objective showed that a sub-ambient pressure-driven separation process, coupled with downstream liquefaction, could be used without the need for external refrigeration. excess low-quality cooling could also be used for the dehydration of the flue gas, a key challenge facing adsorptive co2 capture. this process would be significantly limited by its capital costs, consistent with expectation. regardless of the separation considered, the capital and energy costs of pre- and post-treatment of co2 lead to costs of co2 capture exceeding $47/tonneco2, and the best case study of sub-ambient pressure swing adsorption led to costs of capture around $60/tonneco2. preliminary analysis shows a more complicated process, where the post-treatment liquefaction is removed or replaced with a low-cost membrane or adsorbent system that could allow for additional cost reductions. 
the second objective focused on the production and spinning of mof fiber sorbents, which showed the potential, in simulation, when combined with the work from objective 3 to reach 8-10x the performance of traditional pellet packed bed systems. work here focused on the development of scale-up and manufacture of multiple mof fiber xxviii sorbents, overcoming challenges in dope composition formulation and particle size resulting in sorbent leaching not previously reported in fiber sorbent spinning. 
the third objective focused on the development of a passive internal heat management strategy for pressure swing adsorption in the fiber sorbent morphology. microencapsulated phase change materials were, for the first time, incorporated into fiber sorbents in the spinning step, allowing for a reduction in the manufacturing complexity of heat management in psa systems. a 20-25% improvement in the breakthrough capacity of the sorbent and 30-40% reduction in amplitude of the thermal front prove the manufacturing process works and will enable more efficient sorbent performance.
the final objective looked at the operation of a pressure swing adsorption unit for the removal of co2 from simulated flue gas within the sub-ambient process framework. mof fiber sorbents with and without phase change materials were compared in terms of the tradeoffs between purity, recovery, and co2 productivity. this preliminary analysis showed there was much potential for sub-ambient co2 capture, with productivities as high as 0.01 mol kg-1 sec-1 achieved using mof fibers. due to the single bed cycles used in these experiments, the recovery of the system suffered (never exceeding 45%), but future work focused on optimizing more complex cycles should allow for improvements in this area. thermally modulated fiber adsorbents were also considered in the sub-ambient psa system, showing higher purities and productivities than fibers without heat management at comparable recovery levels.ph.d",georgia institute of technology,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/193'],"[{'name': 'Dewitt, Stephen John Amon'}]",thermally modulated fiber sorbents for rapidly cycled vacuum-pressure swing adsorption of post-combustion flue gas,2021,,

grain shape and particle regularity are important factors that may determine the repeatability of direct sheartests conducted near the maximum box scale ratios suggested by astm d3080-11, e.g. increased uniformity  in  the  particle  shapes  of  test  specimens  seemingly  reduced  the  errors  associated  with  test results. other  key  findings  of  the  present  study  include  observations  made  on  the  effects  of  grain  size distributions  and  the  shear  mould  aspect  ratio  and  their  effects.  well-graded  grain  size  distributions yielded greater strength parameters, but only at smaller box length scales; when the box length scale was increased, the poorly-graded grain size distribution yielded greater peak strength parameters.the peak stress ratio is typically inversely proportional to the aspect ratio of the shear mould size and has been shown to fit an exponential function.afrikaanse opsomming: diedirekteskuifboks toets bly die hoeksteen van die geotegniese industrie, ten spyte van die bekende erkendenadele van hierdie toetsmetode. die primêre doel van hierdie skripsie is om stelselmatig ‘n ondersoek te voltooi wat die effek van die ‘shear mould’ grootte, partikel vorm en gradering van ‘n monster op die gevolglike skuifboks sterkteparameters te kan verduidelik en lig te werp op skaal-effekte wat voorkom in diedirekteskuifboks toets. dit  is  eksperimenteel  bewys  dat  die  piekspanningsparameters wat  gemeet  is  gedurende  direkte skuifboks toetse verminder metdie lengte envermeerder met diehoogte-skale van dietoetsmonster. die beeldverhouding voorsien ‘n unike lens waardeur die opponerende gevolge van die ‘shear mould’ lengte-en hoogte-skale op die makromeganiese skuifgedrag van korrelmateriale kan  bestudeer word.deur die gekombineerde effekte vanmonster lengte-en hoogte-skalete beoordeelmet die gebruik van die beeldverhouding, was ‘n infleksiepunt geidentifiseer waardie mikromeganiese(d.w.s. skuifsterkte en verwante) gedrag minder eenvormig word, en moeliker om te voorspel.die  korrelvorm  en  partikel-reëlmaat is  belangrike  faktore  wat  die  herhaalbaarheid  van  die  skuifboks toetse   naby   die   maksimum   voorgestelde   astm   d3080-11   boksskaalverhoudings   bepaal.   so, byvoorbeeld, verminder die verhoogde eenvormigheid in korrelvorms van proefmonsters die foute wat geassosieer word met eksperimentele toetsresultate

using a qualitative research design, i examine the key governing actors involved and their agency,  the  barriers  and  tensions  encountered in their pursuits, and the  approaches and pathways undertaken for progressing low carbon and equitable urban transitions. this thesis critically  engages  with  academic ideas and political debate on sustainable transitions. specifically, i use a multi-scalar perspective to investigate the actors involved in low carbon transitions, and by doing so, i draw upon multiple theories and perspectives to examine the governance of sustainable transitions (e.g. avelino & wittmayer, 2016; geels, 2005; kern & alber,  2009). whilst analysing urban transition  processes particularly in the context of neoliberal austerity (e.g. hodson & marvin, 2015; peck, 2012), i constructively engage with literature surrounding just transitions, and the ways in which sustainable pathways are also inclusive and equitable, focusing on the concepts of energy and transport justice (e.g. jenkins et al.2017; mccauley & heffron, 2018; mullen & marsden, 2016). in this research i turn to the concepts of path-dependency, path creation and lock-in to analyse the approaches and pathways taken by urban actors for implementing low carbon and inclusive transitions, and to further explain past, present and future sustainable urban trajectories (e.g. mackinnon et al.2019; unruh, 2000).



beginning with a multi-level policy analysis, i reflect that climate change targets are weak, inconsistent and have omitted attention to social equity issues. as a result, low carbon and just transitions are insufficiently addressed in international policy, which in turn has constrained implementing national and local level climate change policy. from a national level, there are inconsistent and disruptive policy environments which are hindering low carbon urban just transitions, and i draw upon the context of national austerity, ambivalence of inclusive climate change policy and ineffective regulation. barriers are also emerging because of local level contestation and demonstrate the more context-specific and spatial nature of urban transitions. finally, i attend to the nottingham example to reveal how agency and political capacity are particularly influenced by the type and size of local authority and actors in power. lastly, i argue that the municipal ownership of energy and transport systems in the city has been imperative for political capacity to enact low carbon and just urban transitions",,"['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/48', 'https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/7745']","[{'name': 'Sugar, Katherine Helen'}]","governing low carbon and inclusive transitions in the city: a case study of nottingham, uk",2021,,

to understand the rationales and practices of corporate climate target setting and reporting, content analysis (first phase) and discourse analysis (second phase) were used to analyse corporate public reports of the top 50 nzx listed companies (by market capitalisation) which enjoyed consecutive exchange membership for the years 2012 to 2016. this was supplemented by twenty-nine interviews with corporate senior managers representing twenty-three companies. these interviewees are responsible for continuing or for looking into their organisational climate change actions.

the findings reveal that a large number of companies (31 of the 50 sampled) failed to disclose any climate-related information in their public reports for the period 2012 to 2016. the climate information reported by 19 of the companies was generally made in a surprisingly opaque way, indicating that there is a lot of room for new zealand companies to improve their climate reporting. rationales for climate mitigation mirror those for wider social and environmental reporting. companies report for a variety of reasons, including as per their business case, regulatory compliance, social responsibility, competitive advantage, public relations and as ‘a balancing act’, indicating a ‘win-win’ logic.

in terms of connection to the wider planetary boundaries for climate change, the findings indicate a large number of companies in the sample failed to consider their climate mitigation efforts. more specifically, emissions reduction target setting and reporting which describe contributions to ecological sustainability and resilience enhancement were often neglected. many of the sampled companies prefer setting intensity targets to absolute targets, and most ignore science-based targets. their targets are mostly associated with companies’ direct emissions. these might be misleading, underestimating emissions and the full carbon impacts of corporate activities. the observations support legitimacy theory, which indicates that some companies are likely to pursue a symbolic approach focusing on low-hanging fruit without making any radical change in their ghg emissions performance. however, the study also found evidence of mixed institutional pressure factors for adopting climate change mitigation amongst those sampled companies. over time, there is an increase in the number of companies reporting and setting climate change targets, which might be explained by an increase in regulatory and normative pressures. however, there is limited evidence showing mimetic isomorphism even though investors (especially overseas investors of nzx companies) were found to have a strong interest in corporate emissions targets and performance.

the thesis utilises two key pieces of software. the first is modelica code used within the dymola simulation environment for engineering process modelling of the energy storage plant. the second is the palisade @risk plugin used within excel for economic evaluation of the plant performance in a simulated uk electricity spot market, using a monte carlo approach for evaluating plant designs in the face of uncertainty.



the first two technical sections of the thesis following the literature review comprise a detailed description of the engineering model and the financial model, respectively. the former describes the equations that are used in each component of the engineering process model. the latter describes not only the equations that make up the financial model, but also the approach taken to estimating energy storage plant capital costs.



this thesis builds on previous work on liquid air energy storage, particularly the substantial body of engineering studies and the smaller but increasing body of economic studies. the market-led approach to engineering design remains, at the time of writing, the only example of a detailed study of how plant design parameters impact the economic viability of the plant in question.



results are presented in two sections. the first discusses the initial engineering-focused modelling in which the bulk of the plant engineering design work was performed. this begins with a deep dive into the effect of design parameters on plant performance and goes on to compare different plant configurations with a focus on the number of compression and expansion stages. the second result section discusses the initial results of the financial modelling using the plant performance results from both the engineering and financial models.



the closing sections discuss the successes and limitations of the project and speculate on other fields in which this novel approach might prove enlightening. whilst a nuclear power plant coupled with energy storage was the chosen example for demonstration of this work, the methodology could be equally well applied to other energy storage plants and is particularly well-suited to asymmetrical energy storage systems",fraunhofer-institut fur materialfluss und logistik,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/86'],"[{'name': 'Wilson, Andy Robert'}]",on-demand electricity from future fission energy systems,2021,,

for these high temperature waste heat sources, the use of conventional heat to power conversion systems based on bottoming thermodynamic cycles is limited by technological and economic constraints. most of the state-of-the-art working fluids are indeed not able to perform safely and efficiently at high temperatures. supercritical carbon dioxide (sco2) power systems allow to overcome these limitations because of the chemical stability of co2 at high temperatures. furthermore, the favourable co2 thermo-physical properties in the supercritical state, including high density, allow to achieve superior performance and lower footprint and cost compared to organic rankine cycles and other more conventional technologies.
with the aim of giving a broad overview of the potential of sco2 power cycles in high temperature waste heat recovery (whr) applications, this research firstly investigates the theoretical capabilities of several joule-brayton cycle configurations. the analysis involves performance indicators and economic metrics, which are calculated using cost correlations and budgetary quotations to estimate the investment costs of equipment. this aspect represents one of the main novel contributions of the research.
among the investigated layouts, the simple regenerative cycle showed the highest competitiveness for industrial uptake of the sco2 technology at small-scales (<0.5 mwe) in high-grade waste heat to power applications. for this reason, such cycle layout has been adopted as reference for the design and construction of a 50 kwe state-of-the-art experimental facility. the facility comprises an 830 kw process air heater able of providing an exhaust mass flow rate of 1.0 kg/s at 70 mbarg and maximum temperature of 800°c, and a water dry cooler of 500 kw heat rejection capacity as heat sink. the sco2 heat to power conversion block utilises a single-shaft compressor-generator-turbine unit and three types of heat exchanger technology. the main design features of the test facility as well as operation and safety considerations are discussed.  this research activity allowed to retrieve accurate geometrical and performance data by component manufacturers which have been used to develop a detailed numerical model of the facility with the objective of investigating the steady-state and transient performance of the sco2 system. operating maps of the unit have been obtained which can form the baseline for the setting up of optimisation and control strategies. the dynamic analysis showed that the system is able to quickly adapt to transient heat load profiles, proving the flexible nature of the sco2 unit investigated. start-up and shut-down strategies able to achieve a safer build-up and decline of pressures and temperatures in the circuit, thus eliminating the risk of flow shocks and excessive mechanical stresses, have also been identified.
a further novel contribution is assessment of the advantages of having the turbine and compressor driven independently as opposed to being mounted on the same shaft that dictates operation at the same speed. the results show only a small benefit at design conditions, but a power increase of 27% at 10% increase in heat source temperature, highlighting the advantage of independent drive at off design conditions.
the adoption of an inventory control strategy to regulate the sco2 system during transient operations showed that the imposed variation in the co2 mass circulating in the loop allows to achieve a 30% variation in the turbine inlet temperature with lower penalties on system performance compared to turbomachinery speed control.epsr",brunel university london,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/14'],"[{'name': 'Marchionni, Matteo'}]",supercritical carbon dioxide power cycles for waste heat recovery applications,2021,,

dejado de considerarse como meros soportes de plantas que producen alimentos y materias primas de diversa índole para ser considerados como un elemento central en la provisión de servicios ecosistémicos y en la mitigación del cambio climático. el área mediterránea se caracteriza por la vulnerabilidad y a la vez resiliencia de los ecosistemas que en ella se establecen. esto la sitúa en un espacio clave ante las modificaciones que se derivan del cambio climático, como son el incremento de las temperaturas y el descenso de las precipitaciones. el olivar, como elemento característico de la cuenca mediterránea, tiene por delante el reto de conjugar unas cosechas estables y rentables para el agricultor con un manejo sostenible a largo plazo. este reto es de especial importancia en andalucía donde el olivar ocupa el 46% de las tierras de cultivo, forma parte ancestral de su cultura y su influencia social y económica traspasa con diferencia a la de cualquier otro cultivo. las prácticas de manejo de suelo asociadas a los cultivos son esenciales en la determinación de la capacidad del suelo para aportar servicios ecosistémicos. en este sentido, esta tesis doctoral se ha centrado en la evaluación de diferentes técnicas de manejo predominantes en olivar andaluz y el impacto que generan en las diferentes propiedades del suelo, prestando especial atención a su influencia en el secuestro y almacenamiento de carbono. además, esta evaluación se ha realizado en diferentes intervalos de tiempo (corto y largo plazo) analizando parámetros físicos y químicos de perfiles completos de suelo con profundidades aproximadas de 120 cm. con ello se ha podido constatar la importancia de los horizontes profundos en las dinámicas de almacenamiento de carbono, puesto que en el área de estudio estos horizontes se acumulan aproximadamente el 50% del carbono orgánico del suelo. conjuntamente con este análisis en profundidad, se ha determinado la influencia de la topografía y las fracciones de agregados en la distribución y secuestro de carbono. el manejo del olivar en andalucía se caracteriza principalmente por prácticas que implican el mantenimiento del suelo desnudo a lo largo del año. estas prácticas implican un laboreo continuo y la aplicación de herbicidas (ct) o la ausencia de laboreo y el uso de herbicidas de pre y post emergencia (nt+h) para evitar la proliferación de flora arvense. como consecuencia del uso de estas técnicas de manejo en el largo plazo (15 años) se ha podido comprobar un importante proceso de descarbonización de los suelos de olivar estudiados, con pérdidas en el stock de carbono que alcanzan los 28 mg ha-1 en ambos manejos. estos resultados sitúan a estos suelos lejos de cumplir los objetivos de incremento de carbono orgánico en los suelos agrícolas propuestos por la iniciativa 4‰. similar tendencia se ha registrado en el stock de nitrógeno con pérdidas de 6,2 mg ha-1 para el laboreo convencional y 8,5 mg ha-1 para el no laboreo con herbicidas. relacionado con este proceso de pérdida de fertilidad estos manejos han arrojado importantes tasas de erosión, baja estabilidad estructural y pérdidas en la capacidad productiva de los suelos. una de las principales diferencias observadas entre ambos manejos se constató en la capacidad de infiltración. en el manejo nt+h se encontró un importante descenso en las ratios de infiltración con respecto al manejo ct. esto fue relacionado con la formación de encostramiento superficial que limita la entrada de agua en el suelo y favorece los procesos de escorrentía. la principal alternativa a estos manejos predominantes es la inclusión de cubiertas vegetales en las calles del olivar. en los dos años de evaluación, este sistema de manejo del suelo se ha mostrado como una técnica sostenible, con capacidad para reducir las tasas de erosión e incrementar las entradas de carbono en el suelo en algunas posiciones topográficas, con lo que puede influir positivamente en la calidad de los suelos a la vez que incrementa la productividad de los suelos de olivar. sin embargo, en suelos deteriorados, en secano y con las condiciones climáticas estudiadas, la mejora de las propiedades edáficas es un proceso lento, desigual y fácilmente reversible. esto se debe a que el desarrollo de la cubierta vegetal bajo estas condiciones no es sencillo pudiendo quedar en una vegetación poco desarrollada con escasa cobertura y generación de biomasa. además, con la supresión del laboreo en este manejo también se cuantificó un descenso en la capacidad de infiltración de agua en el suelo, con lo que esto puede ser un importante hándicap para la instalación de este manejo, debido a un menor almacenamiento de agua en un medio con periodos constantes de déficit hídrico. en conclusión, los resultados de esta tesis muestran que el uso técnicas de manejo con suelo desnudo ha conducido a un deterioro en las propiedades de los suelos de olivar del área de estudio, afectando a la calidad de los suelos, poniendo en cuestionamiento su papel como facilitador de servicios ecosistémicos. la inclusión de cubiertas vegetales ha supuesto un cambio en esta tendencia, abriendo un camino hacia la regeneración de los suelos que debe constatarse en el largo plazo y donde la relación entre la cubierta y la disponibilidad de agua juegan un papel clave en el éxito de implementación de este manejo.the role of agricultural soils has acquired important social and governmental relevance in recent years. agricultural soils are no longer considered as mere supports for plants that produce food and materials of diverse types, but nowadays as a central element in the ecosystem services provision and climate change mitigation. the mediterranean area is characterized by the vulnerability and resilience of its ecosystems. this situates it as a key area in the context of the variations resulting from climate change, such as higher temperatures and lower rainfall. the olive grove, as a representative element of the mediterranean basin, faces the challenge of combining stable and profitable harvests for the farmer with long-term sustainable management. this challenge is particularly importance in andalusia, where olive groves represent 46% of the cultivated land, is an ancient part of its culture, and their social and economic influence surpasses widely any other crop. soil management practices associated with crops are essential in determining the soil's capacity to provide ecosystem services. in this sense, this phd thesis has focused on the evaluation of different management techniques predominant in andalusian olive groves and the impact generate on different soil properties, with special attention to their influence on carbon sequestration and storage. in addition, this assessment has been carried out at different time intervals (short and long term) by analyzing physical and chemical parameters of complete soil profiles at depths of approximately 120 cm. this has confirmed the relevance of the deep horizons in the dynamics of carbon storage, since in the study area these horizons accumulate approximately 50% of the organic carbon in the soil. in combination with this in-depth analysis, the influence of topography and aggregate fractions on the distribution and sequestration of carbon has been determined. olive orchard management in andalusia is mainly characterized by practices involving the maintenance of bare soil throughout the year. these practices imply continuous tillage and the application of herbicides (ct) or the absence of tillage and the use of pre- and postemergence herbicides (nt+h) to prevent arvense flora proliferation. as a consequence of the use of these management techniques in the long term (15 years), a significant decarbonization process has been observed in the studied olive grove soils, with losses in the carbon stock of 28 mg ha-1 in both managements. these results show that these soils are soils far from meeting the objectives of increasing organic carbon in agricultural soils proposed by the 4‰ initiative. a similar trend has been registered in the nitrogen stock with losses of 6.2 mg ha-1 for conventional tillage and 8.5 mg ha-1 for no-tillage with herbicides. related to this process of loss in the fertility levels, these management practices have resulted in significant erosion rates, low structural stability and losses in the productive capacity of the soils. the main difference observed between the two management systems was observed in the infiltration capacity. a significant decrease in infiltration rates was found in the nt+h management compared to the ct management. this was related to the formation of surface crusting which limits the entry of water into the soil and promotes runoff processes. the main alternative to these predominant management systems is the inclusion of vegetation covers in the olive grove alleys. in the two years of evaluation, this soil management system has been shown to be a sustainable technique, with the capacity to reduce erosion rates and increase soil carbon inputs in some topographic positions, thus positively influencing soil quality and increasing the productivity of olive grove soils. however, in deteriorated, rainfed soils and under the climatic conditions studied, the improvement of soil properties is a slow, uneven and easily reversible process. this is because the development of plant cover under these conditions is not easy and can result in poorly developed vegetation with little cover and biomass generation. in addition, with the elimination of tillage in this management, a decrease in the soil's water infiltration capacity was also quantified, which could be an important handicap for the installation of this management, due to a lower water storage in an environment with constant periods of water deficit. in conclusion, the results of this thesis show that the use of bare soil management techniques has led to a deterioration in the properties of the olive grove soils in the study area, affecting soil quality and putting into question its role as a facilitator of ecosystem services. the inclusion of vegetation cover has changed this trend, opening a way towards soil regeneration that must be verified in the long term and where the relationship

this thesis builds on these discussions with a particular focus on the concept of energy citizenship, an increasingly popular concept in both academic and political energy discourse. the thesis explores how a better understanding of citizens’ ethical attitudes towards energy might inform theorising of energy citizenship to better reflect everyday engagements with energy and energy transitions. to address this question, i draw on findings from q-methodological research conducted in denmark and the uk, and further reflect on the relevance of q-methodology as a tool for social science energy research. 

a q-methodological study was conducted through interviews with thirty-nine residents in the uk and denmark, in which participants were asked to consider a range of opinion statements drawn from public debates around energy transitions. q-methodology was found to be a useful tool for opening up the complexities and ambiguities of the topic of energy transitions, in conversation with people of varying levels of energy knowledge. 

the findings indicate that relational understandings of energy systems and a language of dependence, necessity and mutual responsibility are important elements in how people make sense of the energy transition and their place in it. this speaks strongly to recent advances of relational theories of energy systems and transitions, but calls for a recognition not only of inter-connections and relations, but of their ethical significance. to this end, i discuss the relevance of a care ethical framework for enriching our thinking around energy citizenship, and energy ethics more broadly.""i gratefully acknowledge the university of st andrews for providing funding for this phd

för att uppnå målen i parisavtalet (förenta nationernas klimatavtal) om minskade koldioxidutsläpp är alla fungerande och genomförbara åtgärder viktiga, inklusive teknik för förnybar energi och koldioxidavskiljning och lagring (ccs). utgående från det faktum att geologisk koldioxidlagring inte är möjlig i östersjön, är ccsm finlands ända ccs alternativ. ccs (och ccsm) är mycket forskat runt om i världen och vid åbo akademi har en magnesiumbaserad ccsmprocess utvecklats (kallas åa-route).

tes kan utöka användningen av värme som produceras i förnybara källor som inte tillgodoser efterfrågan på en gång. genom att utveckla ett material av ccsm-karbonatprodukten som förmodligen finns tillgängligt i rikliga mängder i framtiden, motiverar ccsm ur både ekonomisk och miljömässig synvinkel. avhandlingen är en del av fortsättning på forskningen av tidigare arbete med ccsm-processen (åa-route), som utvecklats vid åbo akademi. i de två första artiklarna rapporteras arbetet kring möjligheten att hitta lämpliga mineraler (rest mineral eller anrikningssand) närmare industrin med rikliga co2-utsläpp i finland. det är uppenbart att energianvändningen och koldioxidutsläppen för ccsm-processen bör minimeras (transportsträcka och kemisk effektivitet vid extraktion). i artiklarna jämförs magnesiumutvinning från två serpentinitmineraler, mg-hornblende och diopsid från fyndigheter i finland. studien jämför två extraktionsprocesser av magnesium (fastfas / fastfas, 440 ° c och vätskefas / fastfas 70-100 ° c) för dessa mineraler, samt föreslår nya proportioner och blandningar av extraktionssalter.

de bästa extraktionsresultaten i studien med en vätskefas / fastfas reaktor ger en co2-bindningskapacitet på 292 kg co2 / ton (serp-a 500 km från co2-källan) eller 260 co2 / ton (serp-b, 100 km från co2-källan). däremot skulle en fastfas / fastfas reaktor binda 240 kg co2 / ton och 207 co2 / ton. denna studie sammanfattar de olika fördelarna med båda metoderna. beslut om det mest fördelaktiga processalternativet kan göras utgående från möjligheterna från fall till fall (t.ex. spillvärmetemperaturer). ccsm-processen (åa-route) producerar magnesiumkarbonat (vattenfri och trycksatt karbonatisering) och magnesiumkarbonathydrat (mch, karbonatisering i vätskelösning). beroende på förhållandena kan mch falla ut som nesquehonite, lansfordite och hydromagnesit. nesquehonite desorberar kristallvatten och bildar magnesiumkarbonat enligt reaktionen nedan, vilket ger en värmeeffekt som är tillräcklig för lagring av termisk energi: 

mgco3 + 3h2o(g) ↔ mgco3∙3h2o
δh = -1.0 mj/kg mgco3∙3h2o, t=298k

denna reaktion har betydligt lägre driftstemperaturer än de flesta andra kemiska abs-/adsorberande material och salter. utöver denna fördel, fungerar mch även som brandskyddsmedel. desorptions- / dehydratiseringstemperaturerna är 60-70 °c, och adsorption / hydratisering är möjlig vid temperaturområdet 5-25 °c. denna studie föreslår dock att materialet bör blandas med kiselgel för tillräcklig kinetik.

värmelagring genom abs-/adsorption går ut på att använda sol (eller annan förnybar värmekälla) för att värma upp det absorberande materialet under sommaren där energi kan släppas ut (hydratisering) under vintern. i denna studie presenteras två olika koncept. det första är ett slutet tes-system var berg-/jordvärme används som energikälla för att generera vattenånga. det andra konceptet är ett öppet tes-system där vattenånga från inomhusluften utnyttjas. det öppna tes-systemet visade sig vara mera fördelaktigt och valdes för vidare studier.

kompositmaterialet som utvecklades i denna studie, blandad nesquehonite (nq) och kiselgel (sg), abs-/adsorberar vattenånga effektivt vid hög (75%) relativ luftfuktighet, men betydligt sämre vid låg relativ fuktighet (25-50%). dessa resultat erhölls vid laboratorietest med små prov på några gram bestående av granuler på 3-5 mm. maximal värmekapacitet som kunde erhållas med detta material var 0,7 mj/kg vid 25 °c och 0,36 mj/kg vid cirka 5 °c. konceptet med öppet tes-systemet är baserat på en frånluftsvärmepump som sänker utloppstemperaturen (från inomhusluften) för att öka relativa fuktigheten. i syfte för att testa konceptet, byggdes en laboratoriepilot för testning av konceptets prestanda. med detta (större) system erhölls en värmekapacitet på 0,41 mj/kg vid 25 °c och 0,29 mj/kg vid cirka 5 °c.

reaktionshastighetsdata erhållna från laboratoriepiloten användes i en simuleringsstudie av konceptet. i simuleringarna analyserades möjligheten (samt effektiviteten) att ersätta elektrisk motståndsvärme med tes-reaktorns värme (för att stödja värmepumpen) under vinterhalvåret. det visade sig att cirka 70% av elektriska värmen var möjlig att ersätta med tes, som innehåller mch + kiselgel. dessutom förbättrar systemet också ventilationsvärmeväxlarens prestanda genom att eliminera frysproblemet på grund av torkad utloppsluft.

-------------

this thesis covers both research of carbon capture and storage by a mineralisation (ccsm) process and production and use of the end product, magnesium carbonate hydrate (mch) for thermal energy storage (tes). the development of a process using mch as a tes material includes thermal system modelling and simulations using the experimental results.

to reach the goals of the paris climate agreement on reduced co2 emissions, all feasible measures are important, including renewable energy technologies and carbon capture and storage (ccs) technologies. considering that geological co2 storage in finland or the baltic sea region is not possible, the only option in/near finland is ccsm. ccs (and ccsm) is broadly investigated around the world, and a set of magnesium silicate -based ccsm processes have been developed at åbo akademi university (referred to as åa-routes). (often ccsm is classified as carbon capture and utilization, ccu.)

tes can expand the use of heat produced by renewable sources that do not meet the demand at the same moment. developing a material out of the ccsm carbonate product that is useful in the future motivates ccsm from both economical and environmental points of view.

the thesis is a continuation of the earlier research on the ccsm process (åa routes) developed at åbo akademi university. the first two papers study the possibility to find suitable rock (for example mining tailings or overburden) closer to the co2 emitting industry (in finland). it is obvious that the energy use and co2-emissions for the ccsm process should be minimized. magnesium extraction from two serpentine mineral containing rock, a mg-hornblende and a diopside found in finland are compared.

the study compares solid/solid (440 °c) and aqueous/solid extraction (70- 100 °c) from these rocks and suggests new mixtures of extraction salts . (once extracted, the downstream carbonation conversion of the magnesium can be assumed to be > 90%.) the best extraction results with an aqueous/solid reaction would have co2 binding capacity of 292 kg co2/ton (serp-a 500km from the co2-source) and 260 co2/ton (serp-b, 100km from the co2 source), while the solid/solid reaction would allow for binding 240 kg co2/ton and 207 co2/ton, respectively. this study determines the advantages of both methods although the selection of the most feasible process alternative needs to be done depending on the co2 emitting process (eg. waste heat temperatures) and its location.

the ccsm process (åa route) produces magnesium carbonate, magnesite (via dry, pressured carbonation) and magnesium carbonate hydrate , mch, (via wet carbonation). depending on the conditions nesquehonite, lansfordite and hydromagnesite may be formed. nesquehonite can desorb its crystal water and  form magnesium carbonate according to the reaction below, giving a heat effect sufficient for significant thermal energy storage:

mgco3 + 3h2o(g) ↔ mgco3∙3h2o
δh = -1.0 mj/kg mgco3∙3h2o, t=298k

för att uppnå målen i parisavtalet (förenta nationernas klimatavtal) om minskade koldioxidutsläpp är alla fungerande och genomförbara åtgärder viktiga, inklusive teknik för förnybar energi och koldioxidavskiljning och lagring (ccs). utgående från det faktum att geologisk koldioxidlagring inte är möjlig i östersjön, är ccsm finlands ända ccs alternativ. ccs (och ccsm) är mycket forskat runt om i världen och vid åbo akademi har en magnesiumbaserad ccsmprocess utvecklats (kallas åa-route).

tes kan utöka användningen av värme som produceras i förnybara källor som inte tillgodoser efterfrågan på en gång. genom att utveckla ett material av ccsm-karbonatprodukten som förmodligen finns tillgängligt i rikliga mängder i framtiden, motiverar ccsm ur både ekonomisk och miljömässig synvinkel. avhandlingen är en del av fortsättning på forskningen av tidigare arbete med ccsm-processen (åa-route), som utvecklats vid åbo akademi. i de två första artiklarna rapporteras arbetet kring möjligheten att hitta lämpliga mineraler (rest mineral eller anrikningssand) närmare industrin med rikliga co2-utsläpp i finland. det är uppenbart att energianvändningen och koldioxidutsläppen för ccsm-processen bör minimeras (transportsträcka och kemisk effektivitet vid extraktion). i artiklarna jämförs magnesiumutvinning från två serpentinitmineraler, mg-hornblende och diopsid från fyndigheter i finland. studien jämför två extraktionsprocesser av magnesium (fastfas / fastfas, 440 ° c och vätskefas / fastfas 70-100 ° c) för dessa mineraler, samt föreslår nya proportioner och blandningar av extraktionssalter.

de bästa extraktionsresultaten i studien med en vätskefas / fastfas reaktor ger en co2-bindningskapacitet på 292 kg co2 / ton (serp-a 500 km från co2-källan) eller 260 co2 / ton (serp-b, 100 km från co2-källan). däremot skulle en fastfas / fastfas reaktor binda 240 kg co2 / ton och 207 co2 / ton. denna studie sammanfattar de olika fördelarna med båda metoderna. beslut om det mest fördelaktiga processalternativet kan göras utgående från möjligheterna från fall till fall (t.ex. spillvärmetemperaturer). ccsm-processen (åa-route) producerar magnesiumkarbonat (vattenfri och trycksatt karbonatisering) och magnesiumkarbonathydrat (mch, karbonatisering i vätskelösning). beroende på förhållandena kan mch falla ut som nesquehonite, lansfordite och hydromagnesit. nesquehonite desorberar kristallvatten och bildar magnesiumkarbonat enligt reaktionen nedan, vilket ger en värmeeffekt som är tillräcklig för lagring av termisk energi: 

mgco3 + 3h2o(g) ↔ mgco3∙3h2o
δh = -1.0 mj/kg mgco3∙3h2o, t=298k

denna reaktion har betydligt lägre driftstemperaturer än de flesta andra kemiska abs-/adsorberande material och salter. utöver denna fördel, fungerar mch även som brandskyddsmedel. desorptions- / dehydratiseringstemperaturerna är 60-70 °c, och adsorption / hydratisering är möjlig vid temperaturområdet 5-25 °c. denna studie föreslår dock att materialet bör blandas med kiselgel för tillräcklig kinetik.

värmelagring genom abs-/adsorption går ut på att använda sol (eller annan förnybar värmekälla) för att värma upp det absorberande materialet under sommaren där energi kan släppas ut (hydratisering) under vintern. i denna studie presenteras två olika koncept. det första är ett slutet tes-system var berg-/jordvärme används som energikälla för att generera vattenånga. det andra konceptet är ett öppet tes-system där vattenånga från inomhusluften utnyttjas. det öppna tes-systemet visade sig vara mera fördelaktigt och valdes för vidare studier.

kompositmaterialet som utvecklades i denna studie, blandad nesquehonite (nq) och kiselgel (sg), abs-/adsorberar vattenånga effektivt vid hög (75%) relativ luftfuktighet, men betydligt sämre vid låg relativ fuktighet (25-50%). dessa resultat erhölls vid laboratorietest med små prov på några gram bestående av granuler på 3-5 mm. maximal värmekapacitet som kunde erhållas med detta material var 0,7 mj/kg vid 25 °c och 0,36 mj/kg vid cirka 5 °c. konceptet med öppet tes-systemet är baserat på en frånluftsvärmepump som sänker utloppstemperaturen (från inomhusluften) för att öka relativa fuktigheten. i syfte för att testa konceptet, byggdes en laboratoriepilot för testning av konceptets prestanda. med detta (större) system erhölls en värmekapacitet på 0,41 mj/kg vid 25 °c och 0,29 mj/kg vid cirka 5 °c.

reaktionshastighetsdata erhållna från laboratoriepiloten användes i en simuleringsstudie av konceptet. i simuleringarna analyserades möjligheten (samt effektiviteten) att ersätta elektrisk motståndsvärme med tes-reaktorns värme (för att stödja värmepumpen) under vinterhalvåret. det visade sig att cirka 70% av elektriska värmen var möjlig att ersätta med tes, som innehåller mch + kiselgel. dessutom förbättrar systemet också ventilationsvärmeväxlarens prestanda genom att eliminera frysproblemet på grund av torkad utloppsluft.

-------------

this thesis covers both research of carbon capture and storage by a mineralisation (ccsm) process and production and use of the end product, magnesium carbonate hydrate (mch) for thermal energy storage (tes). the development of a process using mch as a tes material includes thermal system modelling and simulations using the experimental results.

to reach the goals of the paris climate agreement on reduced co2 emissions, all feasible measures are important, including renewable energy technologies and carbon capture and storage (ccs) technologies. considering that geological co2 storage in finland or the baltic sea region is not possible, the only option in/near finland is ccsm. ccs (and ccsm) is broadly investigated around the world, and a set of magnesium silicate -based ccsm processes have been developed at åbo akademi university (referred to as åa-routes). (often ccsm is classified as carbon capture and utilization, ccu.)

tes can expand the use of heat produced by renewable sources that do not meet the demand at the same moment. developing a material out of the ccsm carbonate product that is useful in the future motivates ccsm from both economical and environmental points of view.

the thesis is a continuation of the earlier research on the ccsm process (åa routes) developed at åbo akademi university. the first two papers study the possibility to find suitable rock (for example mining tailings or overburden) closer to the co2 emitting industry (in finland). it is obvious that the energy use and co2-emissions for the ccsm process should be minimized. magnesium extraction from two serpentine mineral containing rock, a mg-hornblende and a diopside found in finland are compared.

the study compares solid/solid (440 °c) and aqueous/solid extraction (70- 100 °c) from these rocks and suggests new mixtures of extraction salts . (once extracted, the downstream carbonation conversion of the magnesium can be assumed to be > 90%.) the best extraction results with an aqueous/solid reaction would have co2 binding capacity of 292 kg co2/ton (serp-a 500km from the co2-source) and 260 co2/ton (serp-b, 100km from the co2 source), while the solid/solid reaction would allow for binding 240 kg co2/ton and 207 co2/ton, respectively. this study determines the advantages of both methods although the selection of the most feasible process alternative needs to be done depending on the co2 emitting process (eg. waste heat temperatures) and its location.

the ccsm process (åa route) produces magnesium carbonate, magnesite (via dry, pressured carbonation) and magnesium carbonate hydrate , mch, (via wet carbonation). depending on the conditions nesquehonite, lansfordite and hydromagnesite may be formed. nesquehonite can desorb its crystal water and  form magnesium carbonate according to the reaction below, giving a heat effect sufficient for significant thermal energy storage:

δh = -1.0 mj/kg mgco3∙3h2o, t=298k

atmospheric co2 emissions. meanwhile, ccs is beneficial for the circulation carbon economy.
however, ccs has not been implemented on large scale because of the related risks and the lack of
economic incentives. this thesis attempts to focus on these two problems and provide some strategies to address them. regarding the risks associated with ccs, a parametric uncertainty analysis for co2
storage was conducted and the general role of different geomechanical and hydrogeological parameters in response to co2 injection was determined. regarding the financial incentives of ccs operation, this thesis attempts to increase the cost-effectiveness of ccs through co-injecting co2 with impurities associated with enhanced gas recovery (csegr) and using co2 as cushion gas in the underground gas storage reservoir (ugsr).
in order to understand the thermal-hydrological-mechanical (thm) process of co2 storage, the thm
coupled simulator tough2mp (tmvoc)-flac3d was developed. by using the developed tough2mp (tmvoc)-flac3d simulator, numerical simulation for hundreds of sampled data was performed for results generated by the quasi-monte carlo method. based on the simulation results, the general role of different geomechanical and hydrogeological parameters was determined in response to co2 injection using distance correlation. in addition, a risk factor was defined to characterize the risks of the caprock due to co2 injection. the results showed that the  reservoir permeability and the injection rate are the two most important factors in determining the pressure change. moreover, the reservoir young’s modulus plays the most vital role in formation deformation including vertical displacement. the pressure change exhibits a much closer correlation with the risk factor in comparison to the formation deformation, indicating the importance of pressure change in the integrity assessment of the caprock. by using the machine learning approach in support vector regression (svr), the svr surrogate model was well-trained based on the data regarding simulated results, and its reliability was verified
using the test data. thereafter, the formation response including the pressure change as well as formation deformation, can be predicted using the trained svr surrogate model within a very short time. the methods and working scheme applied in this work can be used to guide time and effort spent mitigating the uncertainty in these parameters to acquire trustworthy model forecasts and risk assessments in ccs projects.
attempting to decrease the cost of ccs operation, co2 injection with impurity gas, i.e., n2 and o2, into
a depleted gas reservoir was investigated. the impacts of the key parameters on the performance of co2 storage and csegr were analyzed in detail. the results showed that the effect of impurities on co2 storage capacity is dependent on the reservoir pressure and temperature conditions, and the concentration of impurities. the depleted gas reservoir with a relatively low temperature and low
irreducible water saturation is favorable to the co2 storage capacity. a low primary gas recovery for the
depleted gas reservoir is in favor of csegr, while it is suitable for dedicated co2 storage when the primary gas recovery is high. in addition, it is suggested to produce the ch4 as possible before the
operation of co2 storage and csegr. the chromatographic partitioning phenomenon may occur when n2 and o2 were co-injected with co2 into depleted gas reservoirs, which could be used as a monitoring strategy for the co2 front and potential co2 leakage. in addition to the solubility and concentration of the impurity gas would affect this phenomenon, there is a critical water saturation for the occurrence of significant chromatographic partitioning phenomenon associated with determined type and concentration of impurity gas.
to increase the cost-effectiveness of ccs, the suitability of utilizing co2 as the cushion gas in the
ugsr was analyzed based on the geological parameters of donghae depleted gas reservoir in korea. the cyclic ch4 production and injection were conducted over a period of 15 years to acquire the mixing behavior of co2 and ch4 in a relatively long-term period. the results showed that the maximum co2 concentration that can be used for cushion gas is 9% under the condition of production and injection for 120 and 180 days in a production cycle at a rate of 4.05 and 2.7 kg/s, respectively. the typical curve of the mixing zone thickness can be divided into four stages, i.e., the increasing stage, smooth stage,
suddenly increasing stage, and periodic change stage. the co2 fraction in the ugsr, reservoir
permeability, and production rate have a significant effect on the breakthrough of co2 in the production
well, while the effect of water saturation and temperature is neglectable. for the purpose of utilizing more co2 as cushion gas in the ugsr, co2 is supposed to be injected for supplementation during the operation of ugsr.
generally, the parametric uncertainty analysis conducted in this thesis is beneficial for the risk

in this study, we investigated an alternative method in which power ultrasound was used to carry out the sabatier process at ambient conditions i.e., at room temperature and pressure and without the use of catalysts to produce methane (ch4) from co2. we named this process as the “sono-sabatier process”. in this process, a small quantity of co2 (<3 %) and molecular hydrogen (h2) gas mixture was used to saturate a solution such as either pure water, artificial seawater or nacl (of low concentrations, from 0.5 to 1.0 m) in a specially designed sonochemical reactor, equipped with a 488 khz ultrasonic transducer. after 1 hour of ultrasonication, the gas samples were collected and analyzed by gas chromatography (gc). it was found that a portfolio of various hydrocarbons such as ch4, c2h4 and c2h6 were formed by the reduction of co2. we found that there are several parameters governing the sono-sabatier process. one of the most important parameters is the effect of molecular hydrogen gas concentration. it was observed that yields of hydrocarbons increased significantly with the increase of hydrogen concentration. we also witnessed that hydrogen gas played two different roles. the first role is the supply of hydrogen to the co2 methanation reaction. in the second role, hydrogen acts as a reducing agent where it scavenges the hydroxyl radicals (oh•) formed during water sonolysis (water dissociation into radicals under ultrasonication) creating a strong reducing environment. another important parameter that governs the sono-sabatier process is the concentration of nacl in the ultrasonicated solution. yields of hydrocarbons increased with increasing concentration of nacl up to 1.0 m and then decreased. it is well known in sonochemistry that increasing nacl concentration decreases cavitational activity. however, at 1.0 m nacl concentration and 98 % h2 mixed with 2 % co2, optimal conditions were obtained where the highest reduction environment was seen, due to the synergistic effects of molecular hydrogen and 1.0 m nacl solution. these findings were applied to the co2 to hydrocarbon conversion from synthetic industrial flue gases. however, since the flue gas contains around 13 % of co2, it requires to be diluted with molecular hydrogen for efficient conversion. it was also found that synthetic seawater could be used as the ultrasonicating media for the co2 conversion where ca. 40 % methane yield was obtained (paper 4).
moreover, the effects of ultrasound on the electrochemical reduction of co2 (co2rr) into hydrocarbons were also studied. we have named this approach as the sono-co2rr process. it was found that the cathodic current density for the co2 reduction increased significantly in the presence of ultrasound when compared to silent conditions (absence of ultrasound). it was observed that ultrasound increased significantly the faradaic efficiency of co, ch4 and c2h4 formation. under ultrasonication, 40 % higher faradaic efficiencies of methane were observed that in the absence of ultrasound for identical mass transport conditions. interestingly, the faradaic efficiency of hydrogen gas formation decreased in the presence of ultrasound. we postulated that (i) hydrogen gas was consumed in the sono-co2rr process giving rise to higher amounts of hydrocarbons, and (ii) hydrogen initiated new reaction pathways yielding new products such as ethylene (c2h4) and ethanol (c2h5oh) (paper 3).

mehr als unumgänglich anzusehen, um die ziele aus dem pariser klimaabkommen zu erreichen. unabhängig von der politischen diskussion ist jedoch allgemein anerkannt, dass speziell die abscheidung von co2 aus verdünnten abgasströmen eine große herausforderung darstellt. zwar gibt es mit der co2 rauchgaswäsche mittels wässriger aminlösung bereits eine ausgereifte technologie, jedoch bringt diese einige nachteile mit sich. prozessbedingt ist der energiebedarf für die abscheidung von co2 nicht zuletzt aufgrund der hohen wärmekapazität der eingesetzten amin lösung hoch. neben dem hohen energieverbrauch bedingt der einsatz von wässrigen aminlösungen aber auch zusätzliche emissionen von potenziell gesundheitsgefährdenden stoffen, führt zu korrosionsproblemen und bedingt hohe investitions- und betriebskosten. aus oben genannten gründen beschäftigen sich viele studien der letzten jahre mit neuen technologien zur co2 abscheidung. eine vielversprechende und oft zitierte technologie ist die abscheidung von co2 mittels temperaturwechseladsorption (tsa). im gegensatz zur aminwäsche, zirkuliert bei tsa ein pulverförmiger feststoff zwischen einem adsorptionsreaktor, wo das co2 aus dem abgas aufgenommen wird und einem regenerationsreaktor, wo das auf dem feststoff gebundeneco2 meist in konzentrierter form wieder freigegeben wird. der einsatz eines feststoffes

abscheidung aus industrie- und kraftwerksabgasen birgt jedoch viele herausforderungen, die eingut durchdachtes anlagenkonzept bedürfen.im jahr 2015, wurde ein neuartiges konzept zur abscheidung von co2 mittels tsa in mehrstufigen wirbelschichtreaktoren von der tu wien vorgestellt und innerhalb einer eigens entwickelten laboranlage erfolgreich demonstriert. das neue konzept konnte eine vielversprechende abscheideleistung erzielen und wurde im zuge zahlreicher parametervariationen im detail untersucht. im zuge dieser arbeit, wird das design einer darauf basierenden tsa pilotanlage

undisputed, it is more and more seen as inevitable to achieve climate targets of the paris climate agreement. on the other side, what is broadly accepted is, that especially the capture part of ccs is a major challenge. co2 scrubbing by utilization of aqueous amine solutions is still seen as the current state of the art technology. but due to the utilization of a water-based liquid, some inherent drawbacks come with this technology. besides the large energy demand required to achieve the temperature swing necessary for removal of the co2 and subsequent regeneration of the liquid, the process also suffers from additional emissions of harmful species, corrosion and fouling issues as well as high investment and operating costs. therefore, many studies in the past two decades focused on the identification of alternative paths for separation of co2. one emerging technology with high potential is temperature swing adsorption(tsa). instead of a liquid solvent, tsa for co2 capture utilizes a solid sorbent (usually in form of a powder) which is circulated between an adsorption reactor, where co2 is loaded onto the sorbent, anda regenerator, where the co2 is released preferably in a concentrated form. the utilization of a solid sorbent has the potential to eliminate above mentioned drawbacks or to bring a significant improvement at least. although, tsa is not new at all, the application of tsa for capture of co2 from large scale sources is novel and comes with many challenges. to fully exploit advantages of solid sorbents, a sophisticated process set-up is required. in 2015 a novel tsa set-up based on multistage fluidized beds was presented by tu wien and a proveof concept was delivered by continuous operation of a bench scale unit. several parameter variations indicated highly promising process performance, but various limitations and uncertainties of results atbench scale hindered further process development. within this work, the design of a tsa pilot plant based on multistage fluidized beds for capture of co2 is elaborated. although some of the advantages of a solid sorbent over a liquid amine solvent are evident, the handling of powdery material within a continuous process is more complicated. ininvestigations of the process sub systems the special requirements and challenges for the multistage fluidized bed columns, sorbent transport sections, and a heat recovery system are investigated, and design solutions are derived. an essential part of this work is the integration of detailed studies on the fluid-dynamic design of multistage fluidized bed systems, heat exchanger design, as well as experimental results from bench scale and modelling results. with the gained knowledge, a design strategy for a tsa pilot unit with a capture capacity of 1 ton/day is elaborated and the main equipment is dimensioned. furthermore, an overview of results from detailed engineering, erection and commissioning phase are

steelmaking is investigated. the current state of the art in sulphur removal in ironmaking and oxygen steelmaking is discussed (part i of this thesis) and optimisation of the hot metal desulphurisation (hmd) slag, which is an important aspect of present day desulphurisation, is investigated (part ii of this thesis). furthermore, since the steelmaking industry will change significantly as a result of the global climate change mitigation, desulphurisation of hot metal from hisarna, a new low-co2 ironmaking process, is studied (part iii of this thesis). finally, an overview of the main conclusions of this work, as well as an outlook about desulphurisation in iron- and steelmaking for the coming decades, based on the research presented in this thesis, is given in part iv of this thesis. sulphur is an unwanted impurity in steel that lowers the formability and weldability of steel and it makes steel more brittle. therefore, steelmakers try to limit the concentration of sulphur in the steel. in 2021, globally roughly two third of the steel is produced via the bf-bof steelmaking process, where iron ore is reduced by carbon (coal and coke) in the blast furnace (bf), and the hot metal from the bf is refined in the basic oxygen furnace (bof, or converter). sulphur can be removed at different process steps in the steelmaking process chain, like at the hmd, at the converter, or at the secondary metallurgy processes. because of the low oxygen activity in hot metal, sulphur is most efficiently removed at the hmd process. in chapter 2, the different sulphur removal steps in the steelmaking process chain are discussed. here also the different hmd processes that are globally being used are discussed. the two most important hmd processes are the co-injection process (where desulphurising reagents, typically mg and cao or cac2, are injected into the hot metal) and the kanbara reactor (kr; where calcium-based reagents are mixed through the hot metal with an impellor). currently, the co-injection process is globally the most commonly used process of the two and it is dominant in europe and north america. typically, magnesium and lime are used as reagents in the co-injection hmd process. magnesium dissolves in the hot metal and reacts with the dissolved sulphur to form solid mgs. although some lime directly reacts with the sulphur, its main task is to react with the mgs to form the more stable cas, which moves to the slag phase. when the reagent injection is finished, the slag is removed with a skimmer. during the removal of the slag, some iron is lost with it. the amount of iron lost per heat is typically 0.5-2.5 wt% of the total hot metal weight, which is a major cost for the hmd process. in chapter 3 it is explained that iron loss is governed by two mechanisms: colloidal loss (iron present in the slag in a colloidal form, which is removed together with the slag) and entrainment loss (iron being entrained with the slag during the slag removal). entrainment loss can be minimised by optimising skimming conditions like an experienced operator, a clean skimmer paddle and a well-controlled skimmer. colloidal loss can be minimised by decreasing the apparent viscosity of the slag, which under typical hmd conditions means that the solid fraction of the slag should be minimised. this can be achieved by either increasing the slag temperature (in practice minimising the temperature loss) or by decreasing the slag’s basicity, which lowers the melting temperature of the slag. furthermore, in chapter 3 it is shown that the hmd slag also needs a b2 basicity (ratio of the concentrations of cao and sio2) of at least 1.1 and enough lime to convert all present sulphur to cas, in order to have a sufficient sulphur removal capacity. the optimal hmd slag has a b2 basicity high enough to allow all the removed sulphur to stay in the slag (sufficient sulphur removal capacity), but its basicity is low enough to keep the slag’s melting temperature below the actual temperature of the slag (typically 1300-1450 °c), ensuring a mostly liquid slag, resulting in a low colloidal loss. in chapter 4, these findings are evaluated and supported with a monte carlo simulation based on thermodynamic data from factsage, melting point and viscosity measurements with artificial hmd slags and plant data analysis. the temperature of the slag has the strongest influence on the colloidal loss and total iron loss, where a lower temperature leads to a slag with a higher solid fraction and, thus, a higher iron loss. from the typical hmd slag components, mgo has the largest influence on the slag’s melting temperature, where a higher concentration of mgo leads to a higher melting temperature (thus to a higher iron loss). in an industrial setting, it is difficult to increase the temperature of the slag (which is typically 1300-1450 °c). also, it is difficult to influence the hmd slag composition, because 60-80 wt% of the hmd slag is carryover slag from the bf (changing that would require changing the bf process) and the rest is determined by the reagents injected to remove a certain amount of sulphur (resulting in a certain amount of cao, mgo and cas being added to the slag). a more practical method to change the hmd slag composition for a lower viscosity is to add a slag modifier. in chapter 5, fly ash and nepheline syenite are investigated as suitable slag modifiers for the hmd process. fly ash contains sio2 and al2o3 and decreases the basicity of the slag and, thus, its melting temperature. nephelene syenite contains sio2 and al2o3 as well, but it also contains na2o, which is a basic network modifier that decreases the slag’s viscosity. melting point and viscosity experiments with synthetic hmd slags show that both fly ash and nepheline syenite are viable slag modifiers and are a good alternative to the fluoride-based slag modifiers, which are common in industry. fluoride-based slag modifiers lower the slag’s melting temperature and the viscosity of the liquid fraction. however, fluoride leads to health and environment issues and it decreases the desulphurisation efficiency of magnesium as well. as a result of the global climate change mitigation, the steel industry has to lower its co2 emission. one new process that can contribute to a lower co2 footprint of the steelmaking industry is the hisarna process, which is being developed at tata steel in ijmuiden, the netherlands. like a bf, hisarna produces hot metal, but with a 20 % lower co2 emission. even an 80 % lower co2 emission can be achieved when using carbon capture and storage or usage, due to the concentrated co2 off gas. compared to a bf, hisarna produces hot metal with a lower temperature and with lower carbon, manganese and phosphorus concentrations. hisarna hot metal contains almost no silicon and titanium. however, compared to a bf, hisarna produces hot metal with roughly 3-4 times more sulphur (typical sulphur concentration in hot metal is around 0.1 wt%). this means that for hisarna hot metal more sulphur needs to be removed compared to typical bf hot metal. the consequences for desulphurisation of hisarna hot metal are discussed in part iii of this thesis. typically, due to cooling, hot metal from a bf is supersaturated in carbon by the time it arrives at the hmd. this carbon supersaturation leads to graphite formation, also known as kish. the formed graphite flakes can form a layer between the slag and the hot metal. earlier research suggested that this graphite layer could hamper the hmd process, as it would block mgs formed in the hot metal, thus it cannot reach the slag phase and form the more stable cas. this would result in a lower desulphurisation efficiency. since hisarna hot metal contains less carbon, this effect could be smaller or even non-existent for desulphurisation of hisarna hot metal. however, as is explained in chapter 6, this hampering effect of precipitated graphite on the efficiency of the hmd process is very small, for both hisarna and bf hot metal. analysis of plant data shows that there is only a small correlation between expected graphite formation and hmd efficiency. only for heats with a low initial sulphur concentration (below 225 ppm sulphur) showed a significant correlation. this means that there is no significant benefit for desulphurisation of low-carbon hisarna hot metal, compared to carbon-saturated bf hot metal. the lower temperature and the higher initial sulphur concentration of hisarna hot metal, compared to bf hot metal, do influence the hmd process, as is discussed in chapter 7. a literature study, a thermodynamic analysis with factsage and plant data analysis show that the lower temperature and higher initial sulphur concentration lead to a lower specific magnesium consumption. the lower temperature, typically 50 °c colder than bf hot metal, thermodynamically favours the desulphurisation reaction with magnesium. the higher initial sulphur concentration leads to a higher sulphur activity, which enhances the desulphurisation reactions. however, it should be noted that the higher efficiency caused by the initial sulphur concentration is only valid for the surplus of sulphur, compared to bf hot metal. the total amount of sulphur that has to be removed is still 3-4 times higher for hisarna hot metal than for bf hot metal. therefore, the total magnesium consumption for desulphurisation of hisarna hot metal is higher as well. this also means that desulphurisation of hisarna hot metal will take longer than desulphurisation of bf hot metal, which could lead to the hmd becoming the bottleneck in a steel plant. it is estimated that the oxygen concentration in hisarna hot metal (~6 ppm) is roughly 5-10 times higher than in bf hot metal (0.5-1 ppm). a high oxygen concentration leads to a lower desulphurisation efficiency. however, since the oxygen concentration in hisarna hot metal is still low, the expected extra magnesium consumption as a result of the higher oxygen concentration is limited to about 2-3 kg for a 300 t heat. the absence of silicon and titanium in the hot metal will not influence the efficiency of a magnesium-based hmd process. however, a lime-based hmd process, like kr, will have a lower efficiency, since silicon reacts with the oxygen in lime as the calcium reacts with sulphur to form cas. furthermore, since hisarna produces hot metal without slag, an alternative for the carryover slag from the bf needs to be found. a slag based only on the injected magnesium and lime and the formed cas would be solid at hmd temperatures (see chapter 3). therefore, the use of acidic slag additions (like sio2 and al2o3) is required, to keep the slag liquid and minimise the iron loss. still, the higher slag volumes as a result of more sulphur that has to be removed will lead to a higher iron loss, compared to desulphurisation of typical bf hot metal. because the hisarna produces, and taps, hot metal continuously with a constant composition and temperature, it is ideal for continuous hot metal desulphurisation. therefore, at tata steel in ijmuiden, the netherlands, a new continuous hot metal desulphurisation (chmd) process is being developed. in chapter 8, this novel chmd process is introduced. the chmd process is based on the magnesium-lime co-injection hmd process. it uses several reactors in series (process simulations suggest three reactors in series are required to desulphurise typical hisarna hot metal to typical post-hmd sulphur concentrations), to limit the total reactor volume. the desulphurisation efficiency of the process is increased by optimising the reactor dimensions to a height to diameter ratio of 5:1, whereas a typical hot metal ladle, used for the batch hmd, has a height to diameter ratio of 1.5:1. it is expected that this leads to a reduction in reagent consumption of ~20 %. furthermore, the continuous nature of the process allows for a foxhole-type slag skimming (separating slag and hot metal by their density difference), which will lead to an estimated 60 % lower total iron loss, compared to the skimming method of the batch hmd process (a remote-controlled skimmer arm, raking off the slag). based on the cost estimation for iron loss and reagent costs, the cost for desulphurising one tonne hot metal with the chmd process will be approximately € 2 lower than with the state-of-the-art batch hmd process. however, according to the current calculations, the residence time of the hot metal in the chmd is 3-4 times longer than in a batch hmd process, leading to a higher temperature loss and, possibly, a higher co2 footprint, as a lower temperature allows for less scrap being charged at the converter. given the already lower temperature of hisarna hot metal, compared to bf hot metal, this is an issue that needs to be solved before the chmd process can be used in industry. currently the development of the chmd process is still in the conceptual design phase. the changes in the global steel industry as a result of the climate change mitigation will not stop after 2030. finally, in 2050, the steel industry should be co2-neutral. in chapter 10, an outlook is given for the expected changes in the steel industry between now and 2050 and its impact on sulphur removal in iron- and steelmaking. the amount of carbon used to reduce iron ore will gradually decrease and so will the demand for hmd, as the carbon sources coal and coke are the largest source of sulphur in hot metal. however, it is unlikely that carbon can be fully replaced by hydrogen or electricity. it is expected that in 2050 still a significant amount of steel will be produced via carbon-utilising smelting processes, like hisarna, in combination with carbon capture and usage. besides, scrap contains sulphur that needs to be removed as well. it is expected that the share of scrap as a source of iron in the steelmaking industry will increase in the coming decades. therefore, steel desulphurisation will remain necessary in every steel plant and hot metal desulphurisation will be required as well for the carbon-utilising plants.team yongxiang yan",,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/531'],"[{'name': 'Schrama,

los resultados obtenidos han sido muy prometedores, alcanzándose capacidades de adsorción y selectividades comparables a las de otros materiales complejos incluso a temperaturas elevadas. cabe destacar, además, que la presencia de h2ov, o bien no afecta de manera significativa al rendimiento de los materiales analizados; o bien, podría actuar de forma sinérgica y mejorar su capacidad de adsorción. por otro lado, se ha conseguido profundizar y establecer relaciones muy interesantes entre las características estructurales del material (porosidad, química superficial, morfología, etc.) y la capacidad de adsorción en diferentes condiciones; y se han calculado diversos parámetros termodinámicos y cinéticos importantes para futuras etapas de diseño.la adsorción de co2 sobre sólidos porosos en sistemas de post-combustión constituye una de las alternativas prioritarias para reducir y estabilizar su concentración a los niveles exigidos. entre los adsorbentes estudiados, los materiales de carbono resultan especialmente interesantes debido al carácter hidrofóbico (mayor estabilidad en presencia de humedad) y menor calor de adsorción (facilidad de regeneración) que generalmente presentan. en el contexto de desarrollo sostenible, su obtención a partir de residuos biomásicos conllevaría beneficios sinérgicos adicionales, al capturarse co2 y valorizarse un residuo simultáneamente. sin embargo, las condiciones típicas de las corrientes de post-combustión suponen un verdadero reto y sus capacidades de adsorción y selectividades aún deben ser mejoradas para su implementación real. ambos parámetros están intrínsecamente relacionados con las propiedades fisicoquímicas y estructurales del material, por lo que los esfuerzos se están orientando a clarificar su influencia, así como a desarrollar nuevos materiales carbonosos con las características óptimas.
en esta línea, el objetivo principal de esta tesis doctoral ha sido caracterizar y evaluar una serie de materiales de carbono diferentes como adsorbentes de co2 en condiciones de post-combustión. en concreto, se han preparado seis materiales de carbón a partir de cuatro tipos de residuos lignocelulósicos con alto potencial de valorización, abundantes y de bajo coste: fibras de carbón por electrospinning, fcl, y un carbonizado granular, gcl, a partir de lignina alcell®; dos carbones activos, gas y gawba, por activación física de hueso de aceituna y residuo de aglomerado de madera, respectivamente. gawba fue, además, impregnado con acetato de bario en una etapa posterior para dotarlo de un cierto número de grupos básicos superficiales",uma editorial,['https://api.core.ac.uk/v3/data-providers/2072'],"[{'name': 'Calvo Muñoz, Elisa María'}]",preparación de fibras y otros materiales de carbono para adsorción de co2 en post-combustión,2022,,
