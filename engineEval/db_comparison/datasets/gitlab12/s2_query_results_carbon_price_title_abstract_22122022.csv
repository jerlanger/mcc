The problem decides optimal carbon trade, raw material purchasing, raw materials and sinters inventory levels, as well as sintering and iron making production schemes, so as to minimize the total cost. A novel mixed integer programming model incorporating carbon emission reduction into operational decision making is developed and we propose a branch and price algorithm to solve it. The model is decomposed equally into a master problem and two subproblems. The branch and price algorithm is enhanced by two tailored techniques. First, the relaxation of the master problem is strengthened by introducing two families of valid inequalities. Second, we use a dynamic programming procedure to eliminate variables by path reduced cost. We test our algorithm on randomly generated data that simulate the practical production, and the computational results over the instances illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. In addition, we derive the optimal operational decisions, and examine the impacts of carbon cap and carbon price analytically and numerically on total cost and carbon emissions. We make interesting observations based on numerical results and provide managerial insight to highlight the opportunity to reduce carbon emissions.","[""abstract""]"

We revised the inter‐temporal dynamic optimization model DICE‐2013R by introducing three features as follows. First, we applied a new marginal abatement cost curve derived under moderate assumptions regarding future socioeconomic development—the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 2 (SSP2) scenario. Second, we addressed emission abatement for not only industrial CO2 but also land‐use CO2, CH4, N2O, halogenated gases, CO, volatile organic compounds, SOx, NOx, black carbon and organic carbon. Third, we improved the treatment of the non‐CO2 components in the climate module based on MAGICC 6.0. We obtained the following findings: (1) It is important to address the individual emissions in an analysis of low stabilization scenarios because abating land‐use CO2, non‐CO2 and aerosol emissions also contributes to maintaining a low level of radiative forcing and substantially affects the climate costs. (2) The 2.0°C target can be efficiently reached under the assumptions of the SSP2 scenario. (3) The 1.5°C target can be met with early deep cuts under the assumption of a temperature overshoot, and it will triple the carbon price and double the mitigation cost compared with the 2.0°C case.","[""abstract""]"

The majority of long distance energy transmission occurs via merchant ships and pipelines carrying oil or natural gas. In contrast, future energy scenarios often envision vastly altered energy transportation scenarios including very high degrees of grid electrification and widespread installation of hydrogen pipelines. The unit cost of energy transportation varies by over two orders of magnitude. In particular, the costs of electricity and hydrogen transmission are substantially higher than the cost of oil and natural gas transportation. If carbon pricing is to be used to incentivize alternative energy systems, these differences in costs will need to be reduced and used when making meaningful technology comparisons.","[""abstract""]"

While a number of studies of the costs of pyrolysis exist, many fail to value the carbon storage benefit associated with biochar. Here, we evaluate the costs of three types of small‐scale pyrolysis systems (slow and fast, compared with gasification) in Costa Rica. We find that under many combinations of model parameters, fast and slow pyrolysis models are cost‐effective. Net present values are positive for slow pyrolysis at carbon prices above $7 t−1, indicating that a low carbon price is required to make slow pyrolysis cost‐effective. Likewise, fast pyrolysis is cost‐effective at any positive carbon price. Gasification is generally more costly than fast or slow pyrolysis, and the net present value of the gasification system is only positive at electricity prices over $0.15 kWh−1 or carbon prices over $150 t−1. Thus, both fast and slow pyrolysis models are promising methods for atmospheric CO2 reduction.","[""abstract""]"

We provide a systematic overview of the practice, performance, and problems of China’s ETS pilots during the first stage, which lasted from 2013 to 2016, and highlight some proposals for the forthcoming national system. We depict the features of the pilots by focusing on the core elements of the ETS: scope, cap setting, allocation, MRV, and compliance. The performance of China’s ETS pilots is characterized by low carbon prices with severe temporal fluctuation, and low levels of liquidity with high compliance rates. The problems include over-allocation of emission allowances, inadequate legal and regulatory infrastructure, underdevelopment of the carbon financial market, and poor market transparency.

In this paper, the Aviation Integrated Model, currently under development at the University of Cambridge, is used to assess the impact of an open emissions trading scheme on the US and Indian air transport systems. The analysis is based on three internally consistent projections of per capita gross domestic product (GDP), population, oil price, and carbon price until 2050. Over this period, relative to a reference case, noticeable reductions in air travel demand, fuel use, CO2 emissions and required airport capacity growth only result in the most stringent scenario of stabilizing the atmospheric CO2 concentration at 450 ppm – an extremely challenging task. The air transport system response would further increase if including non-CO2 emissions from aviation in the trading scheme. This study also finds a different response of the short haul, medium haul, and long haul segments to emissions trading associated with any stringency level. A comparison between the aviation system impacts in the US and India suggests a generally smaller response of the Indian air traffic system to a given CO2 emissions trading scheme.","[""abstract""]"

The study concluded that a coherent combination of policies consisting of subsidies, regulation, and emissions pricing is the most promising approach toward mitigation of GHGs from truck and freight rail transportation. Multiple opportunity areas were identified: more rigorous public investment, freight-specific GHG regulation, dynamic cooperation with the private sector, improvement in technology transfer and technical expertise, development of alternative energy sources, and potentially emissions and carbon pricing mechanisms.","[""abstract""]"

Coal, the most damaging of all fossil fuels, has actually risen from 25 per cent to almost 30 per cent of world energy use. And while European countries have congratulated themselves on reducing emissions, they have increased their carbon imports from China and other developing nations, who continue to expand their coal use. As standards of living increase in developing countries, coal use can only increase as well - and global temperatures along with it. In this hard-hitting book, Dieter Helm looks at how and why we have failed to tackle the issue of global warming and argues for a new, pragmatic rethinking of energy policy - from transitioning from coal to gas and eventually to electrification of transport, to carbon pricing and a focus on new technologies.

We extend previous works in essentially three directions. We provide the first simulation model for electricity taking into account co-firing with a wide range of induced effects. Second, we analyze the impact of co-firing on decisions about prolongation or decommissioning of out-of-lifetime coal plants. Finally, we investigate the consequences of recognizing co-firing as a contribution to achieve the Renewable Energy Source (RES) objectives in power generation. As an illustration, we apply the model to the French power sector. Overall, the results indicate that the biomass demand from co-firing is much greater than that from dedicated biomass units, and that co-firing can heavily influence the composition of the fleet under certain circumstances and policy arrangements. In addition, we show that increasing the carbon price generates a move towards quality that induces consuming more high-quality biomass (e.g. wood pellets or torrefied pellets). We also identify that co-firing may encourage to prolonging coal plants that would be decommissioned otherwise. Finally, we find that recognizing the biomass part of co-firing as a renewable may lead to maintaining a high share of coal in the power mix, which may be a concern for social acceptability in the long run.","[""abstract""]"

Examining research and development, patent, and venture capital data, the authors point out that there is momentum for private investment in green technologies. However, they argue that, thus far, the implicit tax rate on energy in the EU27 is too low and fragmented, the carbon price in the EU Emissions Trading System is too volatile, and the public R&D expenditures dedicated to energy and environment are too low.

One carbon mitigation option is to replace fossil-fuel powered passenger fleet vehicles with battery electric vehicles. This thesis makes a contribution to understanding the challenges associated with implementing this activity in the City of Darwin’s fleet, and does so from a triple bottom line (financial, environmental and social) perspective. A possible implementation scenario is outlined which includes a three phase program, where the initial phase includes the purchase of a Mitsubishi i-MiEV as an additional fleet vehicle. The second phase suggests procuring three electric vehicles (Nissan Leaf x two and Renault Fluence Z.E.) as a trial. The third phase is a gradual battery electric vehicle roll-out across the passenger fleet. The research reported in this thesis applies three complementary program planning tools (program logic models, the Cynefin Framework and community-based social marketing theory) to the implementation scenario. It is shown that they are methodologically complementary and in combination, could be used to increase the likelihood of success of the implementation scenario. This thesis shows replacing existing fleet passenger vehicles with battery electric vehicles will reduce City of Darwin’s carbon footprint while using program planning tools will increase the likelihood of success of vehicle replacement, both from a planning, management and staff behaviour change perspective.","[""abstract""]"

Following the hierarchical model of human behavior of Fulton, Manfredo, and Lipscomb (1996), this chapter develops and tests a model incorporating both general and behavior-specific components of motivation. The research aimed to investigate how general and behavior-specific attitudes work together in explaining air travelers’ carbon offsetting behavior. The study is an experimental study that applied confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation models to better understand the motivational factors that influence aviation carbon offsetting behavior. The sample includes 349 staff and students of the University of Queensland. Based on an established hierarchical model of human behavior, the new ecological paradigm (NEP) scale and the theory of planned behavior work together to explicate general and specific attitudes, respectively. The effect from NEP to offsetting intention was partially mediated by three intermediate motivations: awareness of climate impacts of air traveling, perceived effectiveness of carbon offsets in mitigating carbon emissions, and support for a carbon tax. In particular, general support for the carbon price policy showed a complementary relationship with voluntary action.","[""abstract""]"

CEPS Special Report, March 2014","2014","1","This CEPS Special Report builds on the first deliverable of the project entitled “Carbon leakage: Options for the EU”. It identifies carbon costs, and the ability to pass through carbon costs, as the main risk factors that could lead from asymmetrical carbon policies to carbon leakage. It also outlines and evaluates, based on criteria discussed in the paper, options for detecting and mitigating the risk of carbon leakage in three jurisdictions, with special attention to the EU ETS (Emissions Trading Scheme). 
 
Based on the analysis of approaches currently used in a number of existing carbon pricing systems, it identifies the balance between the number of sectors identified as being at risk, and the amount of compensation provided as a risk mitigation measure, as the critical element in providing an optimum approach to address carbon leakage risks. It also identifies a risk-based approach to identifying sectors at risk as allowing for a better reflection of reality in a counterfactual argument. Finally, the paper concludes that while, with some exceptions, there has been limited carbon leakage until now, the past may not be a good reflection of the future and that measures need to be put in place for the post-2020 period. 
 
While examining a number of approaches, it identifies free allocation as the most likely way forward for mitigating the risk of carbon leakage. While other approaches may provide interesting options, they also present challenges for implementation, from a market functioning, to international trade and relations, points of view. A number of challenges will need to be addressed in the post-2020 period, with many of them part of the EU ETS structural reform package. Some of these challenges include, among others, the need to recognise, and provide for individual sectoral characteristics, as well as for changes in production patterns, due to economic cycles, and other factors. Finally, the paper emphasises the need for an open dialogue regarding the post-2020 provisions for carbon leakage as no overall Energy and Climate Package is likely to be agreed on until this matter is addressed.","[""abstract""]"

Three Essays on the Effect of Wind Generation on Power System Planning and Operations. Major Professor: Paul V. Preckel. In a report titled “20% Wind Energy by 2030” the United States Department of Energy assembled a group to assess the likely effects of wind generation providing 20% of electricity consumption by 2030 (DOE, 2008). While the benefits of wind generation are well known, some drawbacks are still being understood as wind power is integrated into the power grid at increasing levels. The primary difference between wind generation and other forms of generation is the intermittent, and somewhat unpredictable, aspect of this resource. The somewhat uncontrollable aspect of wind generation makes it important to consider the relationship between this resource and load, and also how the operation of other non-wind generation resources may be affected. The three essays that comprise this dissertation focus on these and other important issues related to wind generation; leading to an improved understanding of how to better plan for and utilize this resource. The first essay addresses the cost of increased levels of installed wind capacity from both a capacity planning and economic dispatch perspective to arrive at the total system cost of installing a unit of wind capacity. This total includes not only the cost of the wind turbine and associated infrastructure, but also the cost impact an additional unit of wind capacity has on the optimal mix and operation of other generating units in the electricity supply portfolio. The results of the model showed that for all wind expansion scenarios, wind capacity is not cost-effective regardless of the level of the wind production tax credit and carbon prices that were considered. Larger levels of installed wind capacity result in reduced variable cost, but this reduction is not able to offset","[""abstract""]"

The assessment framework allows comparing transport technologies in terms of their environmental and economic impacts and facilitates the decision making process in the transport sector. The main indicators selected for technologies assessment are: private costs and external costs of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The ranking of transport technologies based on total social costs allows one to identify the most prospective technologies in the future taking into account international climate change mitigation constraints and to promote these technologies by policy tools including subsidies for research and development in this field. However the extent, capacity, and quality of road infrastructure affects the overall level of transportation activity, which in turn affects how much energy is consumed by vehicles and the amount of GHG emitted.

Tracking Progress is the first whole-of-economy report on Australia’s progress in reducing emissions. It covers key sectors – Power, Industry, Buildings, Land-use and Waste, as well as a Special Report on factors affecting energy efficiency activity for 47 large industrial companies that account for 70 per cent of Australia’s industrial energy use. A series of reports providing key findings of the research have been released. The full reports - and their corresponding summary reports - are available for download on the right hand side of this page. The reports include: NATIONAL PROGRESS REPORT ClimateWorks research has found an increase in activity to improve energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the last decade across all sectors of the economy studied. This was led by reduced deforestation and an increase in plantation forests, significant increases in industry energy efficiency and more recently sharp reductions in power emissions. Over the next decade, Australia’s emissions reductions would be led by reductions in power emissions intensity and continued energy efficiency in industry and buildings. From 2002-03 to 2011-12, there has been no growth in greenhouse gas emissions despite an increase in economic growth of 31 per cent over the same period. The research showed that if recent trends are sustained, Australia would achieve over 40 per cent of the minimum 5 per cent national emissions reduction target by 2020 through domestic abatement alone. POWER The Power Report shows the emissions intensity of Australia’s grid-supplied electricity generation decreased by 8 per cent from 2008-09 to 2012-13 with strong reductions in coal generation. Total emissions have decreased by 13 per cent over the same period. Looking forward to 2020, there is a strong pipeline of renewable energy projects and a slow down of the energy demand growth trend. This could deliver 32 per cent of the available emissions reduction potential in this sector as identified in the Low Carbon Growth Plan for Australia. INDUSTRY The Industry Report shows industrial process emissions have been substantially reduced, industrial energy efficiency has tripled compared to historic levels, and there has been more self-generation of electricity using gas. This has led to an estimated 10 per cent improvement in industrial emissions intensity, which has been offset by large increases in production. If recent trends in the improvement of industrial emissions intensity continue, this would offset a portion of the strong expected growth in emissions that could result from increasing industrial production. The current trend would deliver 57 per cent of available emissions reduction potential in this sector. BUILDINGS The Buildings Report shows the energy intensity of Australia’s buildings has decreased by 3 per cent between 2002-03 and 2010-11, led by improvements in the operation of buildings, improved energy efficiency standards, more efficient appliances and distributed energy. However, these improvements have been offset by additional buildings and increased use of electricity by electronics in homes. Despite strong growth in the number of homes and commercial buildings over the next decade, a continuation of recent trends in emissions reduction activities would drive a further reduction in buildings emissions. The current trend would deliver 30 per cent of the available emissions reduction potential in this sector. LAND-USE & WASTE The Land-Use & Waste Report shows the annual area deforested has halved since 2003 and the total area of plantations has increased by 21 per cent over the decade. These emissions reductions have completely offset growth in all other sectors since 2002-03. However, over the next decade, emissions from land-use are likely to increase substantially as plantation forests are harvested and not replanted and there are no further reductions in deforestation. Emissions reduction activity is expected to be limited to 8 per cent of the total identified potential. Most of the potential for future activity to reduce emissions from land-use and waste activities is dependent on certainty of future revenues from government initiatives. SPECIAL REPORT The Special Report on factors influencing large industrial energy efficiency involved in-depth interviews with 47 large industrial companies that account for 70 per cent of Australia’s industrial energy use. The report found that rising fuel prices, the carbon price, the Australian Government’s Energy Efficiency Opportunities (EEO) program and organisational changes have been the main reported drivers leading respondents to increase their energy efficiency activity in recent years. It also found that respondents with better internal practices in certain key areas demonstrate higher implementation of energy efficiency activity.","[""abstract""]"

New low carbon technologies need to replace the current more carbon-intensive options. Promoting this change – at the necessary pace – requires policy instruments; creating efficient policy instruments requires a comprehensive understanding of the dynamics of technological change and current trends. 
 
This four-paper thesis addresses the development, deployment, and diffusion of low carbon power generating technologies. The purpose is to better understand the drivers behind technological change, to explore current trends and assess future developments, and to consider the range of impacts of policy instruments in this context. Paper I uses experience curves to analyze the historical development of a technology expected to play a prominent role in future power generating systems, the combined cycle gas turbine. The results indicate that the rapid price decrease observed at the time rather reflected a temporary market behavior than an underlying production cost decrease. Analysis of other factors, e.g., technical performance improvements is an important complement to economic improvement analysis. Paper II investigates the deployment and diffusion of CO2-efficient power generating technologies in developed and developing countries. The results demonstrate that historical CO2-efficiencies tend to converge globally toward more efficient technologies. This suggests that if developments of new low carbon technologies are induced by, e.g., imposing stringent CO2 constraints on developed countries, these technologies will likely diffuse to regions with less stringent climate policies, e.g., developing countries, leading to additional CO2 reductions. Paper III explores the implications of international carbon emission trading for the development and deployment of advanced power generating technologies. A cost-optimization energy system model is applied using experience curves to endogenously model technological change. The results indicate that in general inter-regional trading provides stronger incentives for improvements in fossil-based technologies than for deploying advanced renewable technologies. However, technological change is mainly influenced by the level of future emission limits and by whether these levels are known well in advance. The results also stress the importance of early markets for new technologies, as early investments may significantly influence future technology trajectories. Paper IV analyzes a potential early market for the emerging renewable energy technology, biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC). Data from a plausible reference market, the Indian sugarcane industry, is used in the analysis applying experience curves in future cost development modeling. The results indicate a large potential for cost reductions, if learning opportunities are provided, but additional financial support is required to make the technology commercially viable. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), using a project-by-project approach and at current carbon price levels, is likely to be sufficient to induce investments in the BIGCC technology to promote deployment and diffusion only once other measures have provided the initial support to create markets.","[""abstract""]"

The carbon market has become a force to be reckoned with in international trade, and created many stakeholders with vested interests in the design of the market and its governing regulations. Driven by the international finance community and clamor from the general public for action on global warming, U.S. legislators are under increasing pressure to adopt similar measures. And as action by the U.S. seems more likely, industries that would likely be targeted by climate change legislation are becoming less obstructionist, increasingly seeking influence over the direction of regulation rather than attempting to block it altogether. Given current trends in business, finance and politics, it is likely that in the near future, the U.S. will adopt carbon pricing as a means to decrease carbon emissions and attempt to halt the progress of climate change. However, with so many stakeholders in the debate, designing the market will be a contentious and highly politicized process. Because of both scientific uncertainty and political factors, there is great potential for market failures, from miscounted emissions to perverse incentives to social inequity. This thesis examines some of the market designs that have been proposed, along with reasons why the carbon market is likely to fail to live up to its greatest promise.

We use data on a multi-age, multi-species forest in East-Kalimantan to study optimal harvest regimes for Conventional Logging (CL) and for Reduced Impact Logging (RIL). We simulate a range of carbon prices with compensation for additional carbon stored under sustainable forest management (RIL). According to our detailed data, RIL has higher fixed costs but lower variable costs than CL, and leads to less damages on the residual stand. We show that when these differences are taken into account, RIL leads to highest LEV for low to intermediate carbon prices, while for high carbon prices conventional logging is preferred. Conventional logging, however, does not qualify for carbon payments. Furthermore, we show that ignoring damages in the model leads to vast overestimations of LEV and large underestimations of optimal cutting cycles for all carbon prices, and to a different choice of logging practice for low and high carbon prices. Ignoring differences in variable costs between CL and RIL leads to small overestimations of LEV for low carbon prices and small underestimations of LEV for high carbon prices, with small to zero differences in optimal cutting cycles.","[""abstract""]"

COST is a static spreadsheet-based tool that uses Australian GHG inventory methodologies, algorithms and emission factors to estimate carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide emissions of a dairy farm system. One of the key differences between COST and other inventory-based dairy GHG emissions calculators is the ability to explore the effect of reducing total farm emissions on farm income, assuming the strategy was compliant 
with Kyoto rules for carbon offsets. COST provides ten abatement strategies across the four broad theme areas of diet manipulation, herd and breeding management, feedbase management and waste management. Each abatement strategy contains four sections; two sections for data entry (baseline farm data specific to the strategy explored and strategy-specific variables) and two sections for results (milk production results and GHG/economic-related results). Key sensitive variables for each strategy, identified from prior research, and prices for milk production and carbon 
offsets are adjusted through up/down buttons, which allows users to quickly explore the impact of these variables on farm emissions and profitability. For example, if the cost to implement an abatement strategy is doubled, what carbon offset income would be required to negate this additional cost? Results are presented as changes in carbon offset income, strategy implementation cost, additional milk production income and net farm income on a per annum and on a per GHG emissions intensity of milk production basis. COST currently contains a comprehensive range of strategies for GHG abatement, although some strategies are still in development. As new technologies or farm management practices leading to a reduction in GHG emission become available, these too will be incorporated into COST. To date, two dairy-specific abatement methodologies have been legislated as part of Australia’s commitment to reducing on-farm GHG emissions through it’s the carbon offset scheme, the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI) and are incorporated into COST. 
These are the ‘Destruction of methane generated from dairy manure in covered anaerobic ponds’ and the ‘Methodology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in milking cows through feeding dietary additives’. As an example, we explored the mitigation option Replace supplements with a source of dietary fats (reflecting the second above-mentioned CFI legislated abatement strategy) as feeding a diet higher in dietary fats has been shown to reduce enteric methane emissions per unit of feed intake. A 400 milking herd was fed a baseline diet of 2.6% dietary fat. By replacing grain with hominy meal, at a rate of 5.0 kg dry matter/ cow per day for 90 days during the 3 summer months, the summer diet fat concentration was increased to 6.4%. Enteric methane emissions were reduced by 40 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (t CO 2 e) per annum for the farm. Waste methane and nitrous oxide emissions were also reduced by 0.5 and 1.6 t CO 2 e/annum, respectively. However, as reductions from these two sources of GHG emissions do not qualify for payment with this CFI methodology, their reduction could not be included as an offset income. At a carbon price of $20/ t CO 2 e, the reduction in enteric methane emissions was valued at $800/farm. The implementation cost of replacing grain with hominy was valued at $18,000/farm due to the hominy meal costing an additional 
$100/t dry matter compared to the grain. However, the additional milk production achieved due to the higher energy concentration of the diet resulted in an additional 70,200 litres and based on a summer milk price of $0.38/ litre, this equated to an additional income from milk valued at $26,676/farm. The overall result was a net increase in farm profit of $9,476/farm when paid on a reduction in total GHG emissions. COST can quickly allow users to ascertain the level of GHG emission reduction possible with various mitigation options and explore the sensitivity of key variables on GHG emissions and farm profitability.","[""abstract""]"

As the future carbon price will vary significantly in accordance with the political and economic situation, a specified probability density profile for the carbon price in the future has been assumed in this paper and the expected profits of the model company have been calculated on the basis of this profile. A power company has been selected as the model company representing a typical instance of a large-scale emitter of CO2. In the case of a single-fuel using company, it has been established that the influence on corporate profits can be assessed quantitatively by determining the profit break-even line with the carbon price as the parameter using the company’s carbon emission intensity and its operating profit per unit of production output. For multi-fueled companies, it is shown that the future optimum fuel mix is determined not only by the carbon price but also by the operating profit ratio for the fuels concerned. These studies have thus confirmed that corporate profits are governed by the ratio of the operating profit levels achieved per unit of production output for the different fuels and the carbon price.","[""abstract""]"

In this context, biomass upgrading technologies such as torrefaction and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), which increase the energy density and improve the storability and handling of the biomass, have recently gained attention. This work provides a techno-economic assessment of commercial-scale HTC plants and their competing technologies. In the first part of this work, energetic efficiency, GHG emissions and costs of HTC are compared to those of wood pelletizing, torrefaction and anaerobic digestion. Moreover, the substitution of fossil fuels by the aforementioned biofuels in existing power stations is analyzed. The second part focusses on the potential role of biomass upgrading technologies for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Torrefaction and HTC cause the biomass to lose its fibrous structure, thus facilitating entrained flow gasification. In order to investigate the merits of this conversion pathway, torrefaction or HTC followed by entrained flow gasification is compared to the direct fluidized bed gasification of raw wood. The analysis is based on flowsheet simulations created with Aspen Plus. Exergy analysis is employed to locate thermodynamic losses within the respective processes. Exergoeconomic analysis is applied to the HTC plant design to reveal potentials for reducing the biocoal production costs. A simple model of the entire supply chain is developed in order to assess the costs and GHG emissions related to biomass and biofuel transport and storage and their dependency on the plant capacity. The results indicate that HTC can only be economically competitive with conventional wood pelletizing if waste biomass is used as a feedstock. Depending on the remuneration for waste disposal, relatively large processing capacities of up to 100 kt/a of feedstock are required year-round to make HTC an economically viable proposition. Potential feedstocks include park and gardening waste and empty fruit bunches from palm oil production. Exergy analysis reveals that drying of the feedstock or biofuel is the most significant source of exergy destruction in all the analyzed processes generating solid biofuels. HTC and anaerobic digestion also suffer large exergy losses through their waste streams. Measures to improve the efficiency and cost of HTC include efficient heat recovery, drying in superheated steam, and using the waste water to produce biogas. Integration of HTC with a rankine-cycle CHP plant may reduce the biocoal production cost and increase operability by omitting the complex heat recovery scheme required for a standalone HTC plant. IGCC power plants with carbon capture are more efficient when employing entrained flow gasification fired on torrefied wood or HTC biocoal than when using fluidized bed gasification of raw wood. However, the higher efficiency of the IGCC cannot compensate for the conversion losses of the biomass upgrading. Moreover, the carbon capture rate for scenarios with biomass upgrading is only 66–69%, compared to 82–86% for the direct fluidized bed gasification of the raw biomass. The unit cost of electricity generated by the BECCS plants is strongly dependent on the CO2 price. The results indicate that if the carbon price is sufficiently high to incentivize CCS from fossil fuels, then favourable BECCS configurations are also close to economic viability.","[""abstract""]"

CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is receiving considerable attention as a potential greenhouse gas mitigation option for fossil-fuelled power plants. In this study, a mathematical model is built to select the proper plants to deploy CCS under the Emission Trading System. The model considers factors such as clean energy development, fuel price fluctuation and economic level growth in the next five years to maximise the profit of the whole corporation under the premise of fulfilling the ERT in China. The Black-Scholes option pricing theory is used to analyse the investment potential amid yearly carbon price fluctuations. A discrete bacterial colony chemotaxis algorithm is then used to solve the model. The model is illustrated by an example of 11 plants with 17 units subordinated to a certain corporation in Hebei, China.

Australia’s housing sector, comprising over 7 million dwellings and their occupants (as well as associated industries), currently has no role in the Federal Government’s Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. This is despite the fact that this sector contributes approximately 54 million tonnes of CO2-e annually to the atmosphere – more than 10% of national emissions. This CPRS omission plus Government’s proposed compensation to households for the higher energy charges they will face once a carbon price is established will effectively remove any incentive for innovation in green building, distributed energy generation and energy efficiency initiatives and will serve to lock in poor performance (of dwellings) and wasteful behaviour (by households). Pathways to a carbon neutral housing future have been identified via a new class of hybrid building. Hybrid buildings can be defined as residential buildings that have a capacity to supply, in total , the annual operating energy requirements of their occupants by utilising locally generated (low or zero-emission) energy sources. At times when energy is generated surplus to its occupants’ immediate demands, energy is supplied to the grid and if the dwelling is unable to generate sufficient energy for autonomous operation, energy is received back from the grid. The Hybrid Building report demonstrates the pathways that current 5-star rated ‘project’ homes (with average emissions of 9.5 tonnes CO2-e per year) can take to achieve zero-carbon status, with savings in CO2-e emissions averaging eleven tonnes per dwelling per year. The report also identifies key transitions in hot water heating, space heating and cooling, built-in appliances and plug-in appliances that can significantly reduce domestic carbon footprints.","[""abstract""]"

This article reviews the progress made on international aviation emissions abatement, provides an analysis of the reasons for the delay and outlines a proposal to advance the debate on how to impose carbon prices on emissions. The conclusion is reached that criticisms of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are, to some extent, unfounded. ICAO’s failings are a product of political differences between Member States on fundamental climate policy issues. These political problems are compounded by the fact that under existing international aviation law, there are restrictions on the rights of a State to unilaterally impose carbon pricing requirements on foreign aircraft. To overcome these problems, ICAO Member States should consider the imposition of an international aviation emission charge that is indexed to account for equity concerns and partially hypothecated to support land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) projects.","[""abstract""]"

Specifically, the problem of optimally selecting equipment for project tasks to simultaneously minimize emissions and project costs given project duration, workload, compatibility, working conditions, equipment availability, and regulatory constraints is formulated as a multiperiod, biobjective, mixed integer program (MIP). Two techniques are considered for its solution: a weighting technique, which seeks to create the Pareto-frontier, and a constraint approach whereby costs are minimized while maintaining an emissions cap. Off-the-shelf MIP solvers, such as CPLEX, can be used to provide solutions once the model input data and parameters are specified for a particular application. These techniques are applied on a case study involving construction of a roadway in Maryland. The developed approach is generic and can be applied over varying geographic locations, site elevations, soil properties, and other factors that affect equipment operation and productivity.","[""abstract""]"

It concludes that the global energy system can meet the challenge of a strong climate policy, with carbon prices up to 100 €/tCO2, through a mix of options. In the power sector, penetration of renewable and nuclear technologies up to 50% combined with the deployment of CO2 capture and storage can result in emission reductions up to 40%. Similarly, in Europe, CO2 emissions can be reduced with 21% 54% in 2050. The contribution of coal remains uncertain, as it depends on the estimates for costs and potential for CCS. Secondly, the implications of high oil and gas prices are not necessarily environmentally favourable, as there is a tendency towards coal, even though renewables also benefit. The additional effect of enhanced technological progress is strongest in the transport sector, where it can stimulate hydrogen, but also biofuels, to reduce the dominance of petroleum-based automotive fuels. Third, enhanced technological progress modelled in terms of investment cost reductions due to additional R&D policies appears to have the most significant impacts on hydrogen production, storage and consumption and on the use of renewables (wind and solar PV) for power generation.

It also identifies a risk-based approach to identifying sectors at risk as allowing for a better reflection of reality in a counterfactual argument. Finally, the paper concludes that while, with some exceptions, there has been limited carbon leakage until now, the past may not be a good reflection of the future and that measures need to be put in place for the post-2020 period.While examining a number of approaches, it identifies free allocation as the most likely way forward for mitigating the risk of carbon leakage. While other approaches may provide interesting options, they also present challenges for implementation, from a market functioning, to international trade and relations, points of view. A number of challenges will need to be addressed in the post-2020 period, with many of them part of the EU ETS structural reform package. Some of these challenges include, among others, the need to recognize, and provide for individual sectoral characteristics, as well as for changes in production patterns, due to economic cycles, and other factors.

The results indicate that the economic efficiency of the clean energy would be higher than that of the conventional energy in the regional energy exchange. Moreover, there would be a difference in the energy exchange's sensitivity to the carbon price gap of the inter-regional energy exchange; setting different carbon prices would effectively guide the inter-regional energy exchange.","[""abstract""]"

This report provides an overview of the rapidly changing solar industry, including international developments and opportunities for Australia to better utilise and benefit from solar resources in the future. Key findings 1. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have become more and more affordable. As prices have fallen, ordinary Australians have been quietly driving a solar revolution. For Australian households the price of an average solar PV system has fallen to the point where solar is now competitive in some areas with daytime electricity prices. The cost of buying a solar PV system today is less than a quarter of the price a decade ago. Over 1 million rooftop solar PV systems have been installed in Australia, up from over 8,000 in 2007. About 2.6 million people, 11% of our population, now use the sun for their electricity needs. Queensland had the largest number of solar PV installations of any state, followed by New South Wales and Victoria. Australian households in outer metropolitan suburbs with high concentrations of home mortgages have a higher proportion of rooftops with solar PV than other suburbs. Households are motivated to install solar PV or solar hot water systems to reduce their energy bills, control their energy generation and make a positivie difference to the environment. 2. Australia’s solar industry is growing rapidly, exceeding all expectations and opening opportunities for households, business and job growth. Australia is the world’s sunniest continent with enormous, but largely underutilised, potential for solar power generation. As the solar industry grows, it opens opportunities for small businesses, investment and jobs in solar installation and maintenance. There were more than 16,700 full time jobs in the solar PV industry in 2012. Australian scientists have always been at the forefront on solar technology, making the first solar hot water heaters in Australia in 1941 and playing a significant role in improving solar PV panel efficiency. Australia is well placed to continue to play a global leadership role in solar energy. 3. Globally, a move towards significantly greater use of solar energy is inevitable. In the last five years substantial momentum has been created, driven by falling production costs and escalating investment and policy commitments from major players. China is the world solar investment leader, setting a one-year record in 2012 with US$31.2 billion invested. Solar capacity doubled in 2012 and China intends to triple that capacity in another two years. Germany receives less sunlight than Victoria but has more installed capacity than any other country due to a significant program of policy support. Globally, the cost of producing solar panels fell by 75% between 2008 and 2011. Total global investment in solar energy grew to US$140 billion in 2012. Total global installed solar PV capacity grew by 42% in 2012, four times its level in 2009. Renewable energy, particularly solar PV, is becoming more cost competitive as countries introduce carbon pricing. 4. Solar will become a more and more important part of the Australian energy mix into the future. Greater demand for solar energy requires grid infrastructure to be upgraded to meet contemporary needs as the industry expands. Modelling of Australia’s future energy usage consistently indicates growing solar energy. By 2050 solar PV has been projected to provide 29% of Australia’s electricity needs. Solar energy systems have come a long way. Solar energy can now be used day or night by storing the sun’s energy and through effective grid management. Internationally, Concentrated Solar Power (also known as solar thermal) plants are providing continuous power 24 hours a day. Ensuring that the electricity network is effectively managed will be important for growth of the solar energy sector. While there may be some challenges, there can also be a range of benefits for grid management from greater solar energy systems. 5. Solar energy systems are poised to play an important role in tackling climate change. To avoid the most damaging consequences of climate change, we must virtually eliminate greenhouse gas emissions within decades. The rapid uptake of solar PV has already made a contribution to the downward trend in greenhouse gas emissions from Australia’s electricity generation sector. The challenge is to turn Australia’s enormous renewable energy potential into renewable power. Given the falling cost of solar energy and Australia’s exceptional solar resources – and with appropriate policy settings – solar energy systems can play a rapidly increasing role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.","[""abstract""]"

First, we expand the literature on quasi-experimental evaluation of the causal impact of conservation measures to include agricultural concessions. Second, our report is rare in that we use panel data and techniques in a literature on spatially explicit land-use change econometrics that has necessarily relied upon cross-sectional analyses because of data-availability constraints. Third, our report is rare among land-use change scenario analyses in that we calibrate the effect of land-use designations empirically, rather than assuming idealized perfect effectiveness of conservation measures or complete conversion without such measures. Finally, we compare the effectiveness of place-based policies with alternative price-based instruments for climate-change mitigation within a globally significant landscape. To reduce greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation, Indonesia instituted a nationwide moratorium on new license areas (“concessions”) for oil palm plantations, timber plantations, and logging activity on primary forests and peat lands after May 2011. Here we indirectly evaluate the effectiveness of this policy using annual nationwide data on deforestation, concession licenses, and potential agricultural revenue from the decade preceding the moratorium. We estimate that on average granting a concession for oil palm, timber, or logging in Indonesia increased site-level deforestation rates by 17–127%, 44–129%, or 3.1–11.1%, respectively, above what would have occurred otherwise. We further estimate that if Indonesia’s moratorium had been in place from 2000 to 2010, then nationwide emissions from deforestation over that decade would have been 241–615 MtCO2e (2.8–7.2%) lower without leakage, or 213–545 MtCO2e (2.5–6.4%) lower with leakage. As a benchmark, an equivalent reduction in emissions could have been achieved using a carbon price-based instrument at a carbon price of $3.30–7.50/tCO2e (mandatory) or $12.95–19.45/tCO2e (voluntary). For Indonesia to have achieved its target of reducing emissions by 26%, the geographic scope of the moratorium would have had to expand beyond new concessions (15.0% of emissions from deforestation and peat degradation) to also include existing concessions (21.1% of emissions) and address deforestation outside of concessions and protected areas (58.7% of emissions). Place-based policies, such as moratoria, may be best thought of as bridge strategies that can be implemented rapidly while the institutions necessary to enable carbon price-based instruments are developed.","[""abstract""]"

The industry’s emissions continue to grow at a substantial rate, spurred by a 5% per annum increase in demand and a lack of large scale solutions to reduce its dependence on oil. 
A promising mitigation measure is the use of the Cost Index (CI) tool, its purpose being to balance the cost of time and the cost of fuel. The faster the flight, the more fuel is used and therefore costs increase. However, slower flights increase time-dependent costs, such as crew and maintenance costs. The CI value is entered into the aircraft flight management system to determine the speed of the flight. 
Analysis from this thesis reveals that CI could result in emissions savings of at least 1% on a flight-by-flight basis, comparable with other measures that can be implemented in the short-term. However, evidence suggests that airlines are currently misusing or miscalculating their CI values, resulting in higher costs and emissions. 
The aim of this thesis is to develop a novel method of calculating CI to make it practical and easy to use for airlines on a day-to-day basis. This was done by undertaking multiple CI calculations for different flight parameters and finding the CI value which minimises costs. This takes into account time-dependent costs, fuel costs and any carbon pricing to be applied, as well as any costs relating to passenger delay. 
The model also has a dual purpose of helping in the understanding of future impacts on an individual flight basis. It is found that in general the CI follows trends in jet fuel costs. However, when delay is added this has the most significant impact on the CI. Conversely, the addition of a carbon price, which is a key policy strategy in the industry to reduce emissions, had a negligible effect on the CI and resulting emissions. Future policy will need to recognise that these flight-by-flight interactions are important in order to find solutions that lead to meaningful CO2 reductions in the industry.","[""abstract""]"

These transformations will have immediate impacts on various of the sustainable development goals. As goals such as affordable and clean energy and zero hunger are more immediate to great parts of global population, these impacts are central for societal acceptability of climate policies. Yet, little is known about how the achievement of other social and environmental sustainability objectives can be directly managed through emission reduction policies. In addition, the integrated assessment literature has so far emphasized a single, global (cost-minimizing) carbon price as the optimal mechanism to achieve emissions reductions. In this paper we introduce a broader suite of policies—including direct sector-level regulation, early mitigation action, and lifestyle changes—into the integrated energy-economy-land-use modeling system REMIND-MAgPIE. We examine their impact on non-climate sustainability issues when mean warming is to be kept well below 2 °C or 1.5 °C. We find that a combination of these policies can alleviate air pollution, water extraction, uranium extraction, food and energy price hikes, and dependence on negative emissions technologies, thus resulting in substantially reduced sustainability risks associated with mitigating climate change. Importantly, we find that these targeted policies can more than compensate for most sustainability risks of increasing climate ambition from 2 °C to 1.5 °C.","[""abstract""]"

The objective of this research is to investigate the potential for replacing conventional fuels in various applications, focusing on the Alberta oil sands industry. Such investigations require systems-level approaches able to handle multiple criteria, uncertainty, and the views of multiple stakeholders. To address this need, the following are developed: life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle costing models of polygeneration systems; a life cycle-based framework for multisectoral resource use decisions; and a method combining LCA and real options analyses to yield environmental and financial insights into projects. These tools are applied to options for utilizing oil sands outputs, both the petroleum resource (bitumen) and by-products of its processing (e.g., asphaltenes, coke), within the oil sands industry and across other sectors. For oil sands on-site use, multiple fuels are assessed for the polygeneration of electricity, steam and hydrogen, in terms of life cycle environmental and financial impacts; asphaltenes gasification with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the most promising option, able to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 25% of those of current natural gas-based systems. Coke management options are assessed with the life cycle-based framework; the most promising options are iii identified as: Electricity generation in China through integrated gasification combined cycle; and, hydrogen production in Alberta, either for sale or use by the oil sands industry. Without CCS, these options have amortized project values ranging from $21 to $160/t coke. The application of the combined LCA and real options analyses method finds that uncertainty in natural gas and potential carbon prices over time significantly impacts decisions on coke management; the formulated decision tree identifies increases of 29% and 11% in the financial and GHG emissions performance, respectively, of the overall coke management project compared to pursuing the decision identified by the life cycle-based framework. While promising options for replacing conventional fossil fuels are identified through systems-level analyses, there are trade-offs to be made among the financial, risk and environmental criteria.","[""abstract""]"

The dissertation is composed of complementary analyses that aim at quantifying the impacts to expect from these sectoral mechanisms. Chapter 1 simulates sectoral trading between Chinese electricity sector and a hypothetical cap and trade in the United States, with the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis model. This computable general equilibrium approach is extended to the case of coupling between the European carbon market and the electricity sector of several emerging countries. Without any limit on the amount of permits that can be traded, the welfare in the emerging countries involved decreases despite the financial transfers associated with the trade in permits. Chapter 2 introduces a limit on the amount of permits that can be traded, in the case of coupling between the European carbon market and Chinese electricity sector. The limit induces a price difference between the two regions. When the associated rent is allocated to Chinese households, sectoral trading can be pareto improving. Chapter 3 is a time series analysis of the coexistence between CDM credits and European carbon permits. It examines the impact of the financial nature of carbon permits on the interactions between carbon markets. Chapter 4 quantifies the conditions of deployment of wind power in Denmark and compares them with the carbon price level observed in the first two chapters, and in Phase II of the European trading scheme.","[""abstract""]"

The model captures the interactions between fossil fuel and biofuel in addition to the dynamic nature of the carbon cycle. Compared with the social planner optimum, two external effects that the market fails to integrate are exposed; the negative environmental impact of emission from fuel consumption, and the benefits of carbon capture through growth in the crops used for biofuel production. It is then shown that these deficiencies can be corrected through a common carbon price, where emission is taxed and carbon capture is subsidized. The socially optimal solution can also be reproduced using a tax/subsidy scheme on fossil fuel and biofuel production. The last part of the thesis investigates the effects of the most commonly used policy instrument for biofuels; a blending mandate. It is shown that a blending mandate will, as desired, tend to increase the use of biofuel and lower fossil fuel production. The optimal tax on fossil fuel, in the presence of a blending mandate, is then derived. If the total benefits of biofuel are high enough to compensate for the environmental damage of the direct emissions, the tax on fossil fuel should be lower than the first-best tax.","[""abstract""]"

The paper follows from a workshop held in December 2009, hosted by the Scottish Centre for Carbon Capture and Storage at the University of Edinburgh, organised by Tyndall Manchester at the University of Manchester and funded by the Tyndall Centre. The principal rationale for BECCS is that whereas the current atmospheric concentration of CO2 is more than 380ppmv and rising, achieving the European policy aspiration of not exceeding a global temperature rise of 2?C is likely to require atmospheric concentrations of below 350ppmv CO2e. In theory, BECCS has the potential to help to bring the atmospheric CO2 concentration to below present levels, or at least to contribute to its reduction by delivering ?negative emissions?. By capturing and storing the CO2 absorbed from the atmosphere by bioenergy feedstocks, BECCS can, in theory, deliver power and heat production with net negative emissions. Yet, while BECCS enthusiasts have drawn support from scenarios of large scale global bioenergy supply and its co-option into BECCS systems, the assumptions of sufficient accessible CCS capture, pipeline and storage infrastructure and that large scale bioenergy supply can be reconciled with competing uses of land (and water) are both uncertain. While biomass co-firing with coal offers an early route to BECCS, a quite substantial (>20%) biomass component may be necessary to achieve negative emissions in a co-fired BECCS system (a percentage that is dependent, of course, on system assumptions). Financially, significant incentives will be necessary to establish either BECCS or CCS; neither are currently competitive in Europe, given carbon prices within the EU ETS which is also not currently designed to credit negative emissions. Nonetheless, in cost terms, bioenergy compares well with other carbon abatement options, particularly if wastes or residues are used as fuel, and modelling suggests that BECCS would be an important component of energy systems intended to reach 350pmv CO2e. We judge that BECCS can and likely will play a role in carbon reduction, but that care needs to be taken to minimise the risks of disincentivising inherently low carbon energy systems via lock-in of fossil CCS. Care also needs to be taken not to exaggerate the potential of BECCS, given that (a) there are few studies of the cost of connecting bio-processing (combustion, gasification or other) infrastructure with CO2 storage sites; and (b) that scenarios of global bioenergy potential remain contentious.","[""abstract""]"

 Carbon-dioxide (CO2) injection is a successful enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) technology that has been deployed extensively in the Permian Basin of West Texas, enabled by CO2 mostly produced and transported from naturally occurring CO2 reservoirs in Colorado and New Mexico.
 Further expansion of CO2 EOR has been limited by the availability of affordable CO2 rather than the existence of suitable target reservoirs for redevelopment with CO2 EOR. The US Department of Energy estimates that 67 billion STB of economically recoverable next-generation CO2-EOR oil exist in US conventional reservoirs, with significant potential identified in other oil provinces around the world.
 This situation may be about to change. On 9 February, Congress passed and the president signed into law a budget agreement that included language to expand a 2009 tax credit for CO2 capture and storage known as 45Q. The key provisions are that, for stored CO2, the tax credit rises to $50 per tonne in 2027, while, for EOR, the equivalent value is $35. The amounts will be adjusted for inflation after 2026. The tax credit is per tonne of CO2 captured as long as it can be established that the CO2 was stored. The tax credit is transferable, hence nontax-paying entities or entities that have no tax liability can benefit from the program. The credit goes to the facility that captures the CO2 and is available for the first 12 years of operation. There is no cap on the arrangement for the tax-credit projects coming online after 2018 or for which construction has started before 2024.
 As a result, the US now has a carbon-pricing mechanism that could well be enough to unlock a wave of innovative CO2-capture projects and lead to a significant expansion in CO2 EOR, ultimately leading to new infrastructure, storage sites, and technology improvements that give birth to a CO2-capture industry.

Variability in one form of generation must always be compensated with other forms of generation at all times to ensure grid stability. This paper focuses on the diurnal variability introduced into the Indian power grid and the consequent increase in ramping requirements due to the 175GW by 2022 renewable energy target enunciated by the Government of India. Ramping requirements were quantified for 3 potential renewable energy penetration levels on the grid by the year 2027. Nine separate solution alternatives are created using Coal, Natural Gas and Renewable & Emerging technologies as solution options to meet the identified ramping needs. Energy-mix and carbon prices are calculated for each of the solution scenarios and compared with the baseline scenario computed from the Intended Nationally determined Contribution (INDC) adopted by India in COP22. The paper concludes that the most energy cost and carbon price efficient paths for India to integrate ambitious RE capacity into India’s power grid would be to convert and operate existing coal plants as peaker plants instead of as base load plants.","[""abstract""]"

So what are the current research hotspots in this field and the gaps that still need to be further studied in the future? This paper reviews the research in the field by a bibliometric analysis. The results show that the research in this field first focus on cost analysis, followed by project investment evaluation, project planning (cost curve and pipeline network), and project operation. In particular, fossil fuel power plants, pipeline transportation, and oil fields are the most crucial objects in the three technical links of CCS projects, respectively. Policies, carbon pricing, and uncertainty in cost and benefits are factors that are mainly discussed in this field. The methods used for CCS project planning are cost curve model and optimization model. The real option approach is suitable for the evaluation of investment decision-making. The evaluation of operational decision is mostly based on optimization model. The future research directions can be summarized as five points: (1) continuously and systematically update the calculated costs in the current research to the unified price of the latest year; (2) calculate the cost curve from the perspective of emission sources; (3) expand the planning region of pipeline network to the country, continent, and even the entire world; (4) pay more attention to the investment assessment of the CCS project that may be implemented with low cost and high return; and (5) analyze the optimal operation mode of CCS in the low-load power system.","[""abstract""]"

This has led to growing speculation that some countries may be taking advantage of the system by effectively exploiting a range of loopholes in global agreements. Using a case study approach, we critically review the evidence from Australia, exploring how Australia has participated in global climate change negotiations and the way in which this emissions intensive country’s national emissions reduction obligations have been met. The findings suggest that: (1) successful negotiation to include Article 3.7 (‘Adjusting the 1990 Baseline’ or ‘the Australia Clause’) in the Kyoto Protocol significantly favored Australia’s ability to meet its First Kyoto Commitment (2008–2012); and (2) successful bargaining for the accounting rule that allowed carbon credits from the first commitment period to be carried over to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol benefitted Australia by 128 MtCO2e. At the national level, a lack of bipartisan political support for an effective mechanism to drive emissions reduction has also been problematic. While the introduction of the Carbon Pricing Mechanism (CPM) in 2012 reduced emissions from electricity production from about 199.1 MtCO2e to 180.8 MtCO2e in 2014, a change of government led to the abolition of the CPM in 2014 and emissions from electricity production subsequently rose to 187 MtCO2e in 2015 and 189 MtCO2e in 2016 with adverse impacts in many sectors as well as Australia’s overall emissions. The current Australian government continues to undermine its commitment to mitigation and the integrity and credibility of its own emissions reductions policy, introducing a softer ‘calculated baseline’ for its own Safeguard Mechanism, which allows companies to upwardly adjust their calculated baselines on the basis of their highest expected emissions, permitting emissions in excess of their historical emissions. While disappointing in the context of the global emissions reduction project, Australia’s actions are sadly not unique and we also provide examples of loopholes exploited by countries participating in a range of other negotiations and emissions reduction projects. Such strategies undoubtedly serve the short-term political and economic interests of these countries; however, it is increasingly apparent that the cumulative impact of such tactics will ultimately impact the entire global community.","[""abstract""]"

In this paper, a two-stage CCS retrofit investment in an existing coal-fired power plant in China including the first stage (demonstration project) and second stage (commercial operation) is taken as a case to decide when and whether to invest. Distinguished from previous models, a binomial lattice compound real options model including the options to defer and expand is established. Further, the accounting approaches to certified emission reductions (CERs) based on the thermodynamics principle are first proposed concerning this model. We find the total invest value under compound options model is less than zero, although greater than that by NPV method. The results indicate carbon prices and subsidy policy, respectively, play a dominating role in initiating the CCS investment at the first and second stage. The growth in government subsidy at the first stage has obviously greater effects on decreasing critical carbon trading prices. Besides, the minimum critical carbon price is 87.09 RMB/ton with full subsidy, greater than the current price (56 RMB/ton). This also illustrates it is not the optimal occasion to invest in a CCS retrofit project for power enterprises.","[""abstract""]"

This paper proposes a new novel hybrid model for carbon price prediction. The proposed model consists of an extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition, an extreme learning machine, and a grey wolf optimizer algorithm. Firstly, the extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition is employed to decompose the carbon price into several intrinsic mode functions and one residue. Then, the partial autocorrelation function is utilized to determine the input variables of the intrinsic mode functions, and the residue of the extreme learning machine. In the end, the grey wolf optimizer algorithm is applied to optimize the extreme learning machine, to forecast the carbon price. To illustrate the superiority of the proposed model, the Hubei, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong carbon price series are selected for the predictions. The empirical results confirm that the proposed model is superior to the other benchmark methods. Consequently, the proposed model can be employed as an effective method for carbon price series analysis and forecasting.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

on the amount to be shipped in each period, where he/she can order items in each

Therefore, we conduct a survey of empirical studies in order to establish the

the survey study, and introduce a novel bi-objective lot-sizing model to find the Pareto

we consider various demand scenarios and other relevant factors, such as product

emissions from the cost optimal solution, compared to carbon prices in the market. 
The cases in which carbon emissions can be reduced most cost-effciently are those 
in which carbon emissions are large relative to costs, typically because costs are the

ReMIND is an intertemporal optimization model that allows the analysis of long-term transitions of the global energy system under the constraint of an upper limit on global mean temperature change. The newly-implemented transport sector is modeled through explicit vehicle technologies, which are then aggregated by constant elasticity of substitution functions into transport modes. The transport sector is fully linked to the other energy sectors and interacts with them through resource prices, carbon prices and competition for investments. Our preliminary results strongly indicate that within our purely techno-economic modeling framework, the transport sector undergoes only little decarbonization while the other energy sectors strongly decarbonize to achieve the required 50% chance of keeping global warming below 2°C. The small transport decarbonization that can be observed is mostly achieved by a fuel switch to second-generation biofuels and compressed natural gas, and some modal shift towards train use. Under our default cost assumptions, new vehicle technologies like hybrid cars only achieve some market penetration around 2070, while battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) never enter the market. The main reason that allows the model to stay below 2°C warming even though the transport sector is still heavily dependent on oil is the availability of secondgeneration biomass, which can be combined with carbon capture and storage to produce negative emissions. When testing the importance of biomass for the transport sector by reducing the total biomass potential from 200EJ to 100EJ, both hydrogen FCVs and BEVs are deployed by the end of the century.","[""abstract""]"

It covers three major topics: (1) the economics of choosing a climate policy target; (2) the economic merits of the Global Warming Potentials (GWPs), the metric governing the trade-off between abatement of different greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the current climate regime; and (3) the promises and challenges with including the GHG emissions from tropical deforestation in a future climate regime. 
 
In paper I we argue that future scarcities—induced by a changing composition of the economy and climate change—should lead to rising relative prices of environmental goods and services, raising the estimated damages of climate change and counteracting the effect of discounting. We show that this may have as large an effect on the efficient level of GHG abatement as adopting a low discount rate. 
 
In paper II and III we analyze the trade-off between abatement of different GHGs. In paper II we estimate the economic loss of using GWPs, as opposed to making a cost-effective trade-off between GHGs. Using a dynamic climate-economy model, MiMiC, we find this loss to be in the order of 5 percent of total net present value abatement costs if 2°C climate target is to be reached. In paper III we show that uncertainty and learning about the climate sensitivity increases the near-term cost-effective valuation of short-lived GHGs—e.g., methane (CH4)—relative to long-lived—e.g., carbon dioxide (CO2). 
 
In paper IV and V we analyze the role that reduced tropical deforestation (RED) may play in a future international climate regime. Paper IV finds that implementing a RED regime faces significant challenges, foremost when it comes to the issue of setting targets that assure that emission reductions are additional. Paper V analyzes the competition over land between forest preservation and bioenergy cultivation under stringent climate policies. We find that the net present value of forest clearing for palm oil bioenergy plantations is positive, even in the face of a price on the carbon emissions from deforestation. Climate policy, in the form of a uniform carbon price, may therefore not suffice as protection for the world’s tropical forests.","[""abstract""]"

Nonetheless, agencies are often frustrated by how best to address the relatively minor impacts on climate that may result from almost any proposed federal action because, as the CEQ has explained, “there are no dominating sources [of greenhouse gas] GHG emissions.” To be sure, the cumulative impacts of all past, present, and future actions that emit greenhouse gases, or that destroy carbon sinks are the essential cause of climate change but acknowledging this fact does not afford the federal agency any meaningful way to address climate change during the NEPA process or the decision that follows from that process. The chapter from the book, The NEPA Litigation Guide (2d. ed., American Bar Ass’n, 2012) has two parts. First, it describes the current state of NEPA law and litigation as it relates to climate change. This part includes a discussion of the special standing issues that arise in NEPA climate litigation, a summary of the CEQ draft climate change guidance, and a tour of judicial decisions that raise NEPA climate change issues.

logging systems employed chainsaws and bulldozers to extract timber. Reduced impact 
logging (RIL) differed from conventional logging (CL) in that it included comprehensive preharvest 
planning, pre-harvest climber cutting, stock mapping, tree marking, directional felling, 
and a set of environmentally-friendly skidding guidelines. RIL has been widely recognised as 
the logging technique to achieve sustainable utilisation of tropical forest. The main objective 
of this research was to compare the immediate and long term (60 years) economic costs and 
benefits of RIL with those of conventional logging (CL) practice in terms of timber and nontimber 
values. The suit of non-timber benefits included carbon, soil, non-timber forest 
product namely, rattan, water and wildlife values. 
The study was carried out in Sabah, Malaysia within the Sabah Foundation forest 
concession. The primary source of data for this research came from a commercial project 
that was initiated between Innoprise Corporation Sdn Bhd (Malaysia) and the New England 
Electric Supplies (USA). The RIL project was aimed at reducing logging damage using RIL, 
hence, increase carbon sequestration potential in forest biomass. 
The economic analysis comprised two parts, namely (i) an assessment of the logging impacts 
on the ecological parameters, and (ii) carrying out an economic cost-benefit analysis. 
Primary data were collected for the timber, carbon, soil values and rattan values using a 
system of rectangular plots. The water and wildlife values were based on secondary data 
from published information. To determine the timber harvest for the second cut, a forest 
growth model (DIPSIM) was adopted for this purpose. Similarly, the potential future carbon in 
the logged forest was projected using a carbon recovery model (C-REC). The valuation of 
the timber and non-timber values was based on the market price and opportunity costs 
techniques. Future costs and benefits were discounted at rates between 2% and 10 % using 
standard method except where costs and benefits were not derived on annual basis. 
The findings of this study showed that using RIL to harvest timber had reduced logging 
damage on the forest vegetation and soils by 50 % compared with CL techniques. Timber 
production per area logged was comparable with conventionally logged forest, but differed 
significantly when compared on per management unit basis. There were fewer skid trails and 
log landings in RIL forest. In addition, soil disturbances was lower on skid trails and log 
landings, hence, the negative effects of off-site sedimentation was reduced. The lower 
disturbance in the RIL forest resulted in higher timber stock for timber and non-timber product 
such as rattan. The timber yield for the second harvest from RIL forest was also higher 
compared with CL forest. However, RIL was more expensive than CL techniques under 
some assumptions and constraints. Non-timber benefits other than carbon in the cost-benefit 
analysis were relatively unimportant. Carbon prices were variable, ranging from negative 
prices, through prices quite comparable with other results, to very high prices. 
The study concluded with justifications to relax the RIL harvesting guidelines that were 
pertinent to the area left unlogged in RIL. There was also a case for exploring alternative 
logging technologies such as helicopter logging to harvest the unlogged area. These airborne 
technologies were conceivably costlier than ground based logging system, but the 
international community could share this burden in a united stand to strive towards 
sustainable utilisation of tropical forests.","[""abstract""]"

This paper explores the economic context and policy implications of carbon embedded in China's trade. China is a net exporter of embedded carbon because its entire economy is carbon-intensive; if China had its current trade patterns but U.S. carbon intensities in every sector, its net export of embedded carbon would disappear. China's success in trade is based on labor costs, not carbon emissions; there is literally no correlation between carbon intensity and revealed comparative advantage within the Chinese economy today. In terms of policy, developed countries have discussed border tax adjustments on imports from countries with lower carbon prices. However, since China's comparative advantage is not based on carbon intensity, a border tax adjustment on carbon-intensive goods would do little harm to China, and would have little benefit for developed countries. A globally harmonized carbon price, often assumed to be crucial to successful climate policies, is not strictly necessary in theory, and may not be introduced for some time in practice. When and if it occurs, a harmonized carbon price will raise costs for China's carbon-intensive industries, but will also create an opportunity for China to “leapfrog” beyond the technologies developed in high-income countries and take the lead in creating the technological basis for a sustainable future.

These two distinctive roles are of course connected: a large fraction of China’s industrial production, and the ensuing carbon emissions, result from international trade. That is, greenhouse gas emissions depend on trade, since emissions located in China are often incurred in order to satisfy final demand in other countries. Is the converse true as well? Is China’s trade dependent on its high level of greenhouse gas emissions? It is sometimes assumed that China has a comparative advantage in carbonintensive industries, i.e., the country is succeeding in trade because its export industries emit large amounts of greenhouse gases. If this were true, agreements to limit emissions would be an obstacle to China’s exports, strengthening resistance to such agreements in China. Likewise, other countries would be reluctant to adopt domestic limits on carbon emissions until China does so, for fear of losing markets and industries to China’s low-cost, high-carbon competition. In reality, the picture is more complex. China is indeed a low-cost, high-carbon exporter, but its low costs do not depend on its high carbon emissions. Indeed, China’s exports are not particularly concentrated in the highest-emission sectors. Section 1 of this paper shows that China’s overall carbon intensity, rather than the industrial composition of its exports, is responsible for the huge net exports of embedded carbon. The carbon export surplus would disappear if each industry in China had the same carbon intensity as its U.S. counterpart. A related finding is presented in Section 2: China’s comparative advantage in world trade has no correlation with carbon intensity. This conclusion is supported both by the data on revealed comparative advantage and by the literature on the sources of China’s success in world trade. Low-cost labor is an important basis for China’s comparative advantage; lowcost carbon is not. Turning to climate policy, developed countries are now debating the option of imposing domestic carbon prices, via cap-and-trade systems or carbon taxes. Such measures, it is often suggested, would leave industries vulnerable to unfair competition from countries like China with lower, if not zero, carbon prices. One common policy proposal, a border tax adjustment on imports from countries with lower carbon prices, is the subject of Section 3. Border tax adjustments, as currently discussed, would do little good for developed countries, and little harm to China. Only a handful of industries are heavily affected, and they are not, for the most part, ones in which China has a comparative advantage. The final section addresses the broader implications of uniform world-wide carbon prices for countries such as China. Carbon prices need not be globally harmonized in theory, and may not be harmonized in practice for some time. When and if prices are harmonized, they will raise costs for China’s carbon-intensive industries, but will also create a market opportunity for China to “leapfrog” beyond the carbon-saving technologies developed in high-income countries and take the lead in creating the technological basis for a sustainable future. The quantitative analysis in this paper relies on the Multi-Region Input-Output (MRIO) model developed by Glen Peters and his colleagues, which has been widely used for analyses of carbon embedded in international trade (first introduced by Peters and Hertwich 2008). Carbon Embedded in China’s Trade WP-US-0906 Stockholm Environment Institute 4 Conforming to the data categories of the GTAP model of international trade, and building on the GTAP data set, the MRIO model provides consistent global estimates for domestic emissions, and carbon embedded in imports and exports, for 87 countries or regions, and 57 economic sectors in 2001. This provides consistency and completeness, at the price of a somewhat dated data set. Since 2001, China’s economy has grown rapidly, with increases in both the trade surplus and carbon intensity of production through 2006 (Raupach et al. 2007). 1. The carbon intensity of trade: three scenarios By 2050 or sooner, if current trends continue, China will reach the level of per capita income in the United States today. That growth is sure to be accompanied by changes in technology and carbon intensity, perhaps moving toward U.S. patterns in some respects. What would happen to the carbon embedded in current trade patterns if each industry in China had the same carbon intensity as its U.S. counterpart? China is currently less carbon-efficient than developed countries. That is, it has higher carbon emissions per dollar of output. As a consequence, exports from China are more carbonintensive than almost all of the imports into the country. Economic growth, however, is likely to bring more advanced, carbon-efficient technology into use, and may therefore narrow the carbon-intensity gap between exports and imports. To explore the effect of technological change and convergence in the carbon intensities of exports and imports, consider the following three scenarios for carbon embedded in trade: 1. Actual trade flows and emissions in 2001 (MRIO estimates). 2. Actual trade volume (that is, dollar value of China imports and exports unchanged from scenario 1), but all imports produced at China’s current carbon intensity in each industry. 3. Actual trade volume, but all imports, and all China exports, produced at the current U.S. carbon intensity in each industry. The second and third scenarios are hypothetical and unrealistic; they serve only to separate the effects of carbon intensity from the effects of trade volumes. Figure 1 shows the carbon embedded in exports, imports, and the balance of trade in emissions under each of these scenarios. 1 I would like to thank Glen Peters for generously sharing the data and results from his model; he is not responsible for the content of this paper, which is my analysis based on his work. Carbon Embedded in China’s Trade WP-US-0906 Stockholm Environment Institute 5 Figure 1 Under the first scenario, with actual carbon intensities for exports and imports, there is of course a large trade surplus: carbon embedded in exports far exceeds that in imports, so China is a large net exporter of carbon. However, if imports to China were produced at the same intensity as domestic production, the second scenario shows that the emissions trade balance would almost vanish: imports would embody almost as much carbon as exports. This is consistent with findings by other researchers; for example, Peters et al. (2007), examining China’s carbon emissions, report that “There is a rough balance between CO2 emissions from the production of exports and emissions avoided by imports.” (p.5941) Emissions avoided by imports are the emissions that would have resulted from producing the country’s imports in China, which is the same as the import emissions in the second scenario in Figure 1. The third scenario shows that if China reached current U.S. carbon intensities while maintaining its current volume of exports, and its imports were also produced at current U.S. intensities, the carbon trade surplus would be close to zero. This scenario slightly increases the actual carbon embedded in imports, because many Chinese imports come from Japan and Europe, where carbon intensities are below U.S. levels. The second and third scenarios both imply that, at equal intensities for imports and exports, China’s trade surplus in embedded carbon would almost vanish – while by hypoth","[""abstract""]"

This paper reports on carbon mitigation actions by Queensland local councils, including four peri-urban cities (Ipswich, Logan, Moreton Bay, Redland), five major regional cities (Gold Coast, Sunshine Coast, Cairns, Townsville, Toowoomba), and two emerging regional cities (Mackay, Gladstone). Two regional cities considered renewable energy guidelines in planning decisions, while two cities purchased Green Power. Cost savings, environmental regulations, council climate strategies/resolutions and climate leadership were key drivers for Queensland city councils to reduce carbon emissions. Peri-urban cities were opportunistic in adopting carbon actions, while coastal regional cities proactively implemented carbon mitigation actions. The paper discusses barriers and opportunities for city councils in carbon mitigation.","[""abstract""]"

The result shows that the Commission’s assessment for the transport sector is defective. The background is that the EU has articulated an ambition to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions with 80 per cent to the year 2050, relative the level of 1990. The transport sector has hereby been given a target to reduce its emissions by 60 percent. The objective for the “Roadmap to a Single European Transport Area” is to propose a policy that attains this target. The review comprises a discussion about (a) the stated emission targets for the whole EU and for the transport sector from a cost-effectiveness perspective, (b) whether the Commission’s analyses are consistent and comprehensive, (c) the scope for designing more cost-effective policy packages, and (d) the need for additional assessments. The Commission’s assessment for the transport sector is defective. It is not sufficiently transparent for the reader to fully understand the results and their drivers. It is not possible to find a clear accounting for the carbon prices that are needed for attaining the 60 percent target level in the “price based” policy scenario. And, the reader is not given a clear presentation of the assumed dose-response relationships between R&D and emissions as well as physical planning and emissions. Furthermore, the assessment does not comprise all relevant cost components, resulting in that the analysis become examples with limited values. Perhaps most grave is the circumstance that the Commission proposes a policy package implying that the transport sector within the EU would meet a carbon price that lies substantially below the price level assumed for the rest of the world. In addition, the Roadmap defines a policy package that seems to contain several large investments/projects that not easily can be associated with the objective of reducing greenhouse-gases in cost-effective way. It is not difficult to construct more cost-effective policy packages. In some instances it is difficult to avoid the thought that the climate problem has been hijacked in order to motivate the implementation of projects or undertaking of investments that have only small effects on the emissions or even increase them. Thus, when it is time for the next evaluation of the EU’s transport policy the risk is substantial that we have to observe that the transport sector once again has developed along other lines than the one outlined in the White Paper for the transport sector.","[""abstract""]"

The views expressed in this Working Paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views or policy of the International Energy Agency or of its individual member countries. As this paper is a Work in Progress, designed to elicit comments and further debate, comments are welcome, directed to the author ming.yang@iea.org. Abstract Changing energy price in competitive energy markets, uncertain future carbon price, uncertain government policy on climate change, and uncertain international regime on climate change mechanism all pose uncertainties to power sector investment. In a process of project investment evaluation, national governments and development banks traditionally use the methodology of discount cash flow (DCF). Unfortunately, this methodology cannot fully quantify these risks and uncertainties. Real Option Analysis (ROA) offers a nuanced approach to strategic investment that quantitatively takes into account investment risks and the value of the open options for budget decision-makers. The objective of this paper is to present a methodology and a computer model developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA) to quantify the impacts of climate change policy uncertainties on power investment using ROA approach. The methodologies include the traditional discounted cash flow approach to calculating project net present value, stochastic simulation to capture the characteristics of uncertain variables, and real options to capture investors' flexibility to optimize the timing of their investment. This paper presents details of the methodology framework, mathematics functions, database, and operation of the model. The results of this analysis are found in Blyth and Yang (2006) and will be included in a forthcoming book of the IEA (2007). Having been applied for case studies, the methodology and modeling have proven effective. This paper concludes that ROA could become a useful tool for the government policy makers and private investors to quantitatively analyze the impacts of climate change policy uncertainty and energy price uncertainty on energy sector investment. This paper describes the methodology and model used in an information paper of the IEA (Blyth and Yang, 2006) and a forthcoming book of the IEA (2007). The methodology and model will be used in future work investigating the implications of uncertainty for investment decisions. As a reference document, it has not been approved by any IEA committee.

These financial incentives aim to alter the drivers of land use change by reducing opportunity costs of retaining forest cover, and are often promoted as multipartite solutions that not only generate profits and reduce carbon emissions but provide benefits for human development and biodiversity. Currently, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is debating a post-Kyoto protocol with national or sub-national emission reduction targets. Anticipating the inclusion of REDD in this agreement, >80% of pilot REDD projects are being established in tropical regions (table 1). While the capacity of REDD projects to meet their stated objectives must be assessed post- implementation, land use change models are powerful tools for generating potential outcomes from these pilot initiatives. Table 1. Extent and emissions reductions for all REDD projects as reported by Ecosystem Marketplace, which maintains a comprehensive and up-to-date inventory of REDD projects that are selling credits and/or are verified by a third-party verifier.

This project is conceived by the Provincial Government of Aceh, financed by Merrill Lynch, and co-managed by carbon trading firm Carbon Conservation and NGO Flora and Fauna International. Project managers estimate CO2 emissions reductions at 3.4 Mt y-1 over 30 years across a 7500 km2 area (Forest Carbon Portal 2009). From a time-series of Landsat satellite images, Gaveau et al calculate deforestation rates from 1990–2000 and 2000–2006. They apply these annual rates to deforestation probability maps, generated from forest condition in 2006 and six static spatial variables, to predict potential locations of future deforestation through 2030 under three different scenarios: (i) a business-as- usual with no REDD project; (ii) the current 7500 km2 project; and (iii) an extensive 65 000 km2 REDD scheme extending across the Aceh and Sumatra Utara provinces. Gaveau et al's chief contribution is identifying locations where forest carbon projects potentially have the greatest benefits for forest and orangutan conservation. By processing Landsat satellite imagery – now freely available – with relatively few spatial model inputs, this approach also has great potential for widespread application in tropical countries developing historical deforestation baselines. Yet Landsat satellite data also impose limitations for REDD. For example, Gaveau et al are unable to calculate forest degradation, which is highly problematic both to define and detect with Landsat imagery, yet critical especially in Indonesia with extensive logged forests (Curran et al 2004, Ramankutty et al 2007, Asner et al 2006). Nevertheless, Landsat remains one of the most appropriate satellite data products available for countries calculating previous rates of forest change. Assuming that technical roadblocks to REDD are overcome, another challenge surrounds assessing the feasibility of emission reduction scenarios, including those presented by Gaveau et al. Their estimates show that carbon and biodiversity gains would be 6- to 7-fold greater if the pilot project encompassed the 65 000 km2 northern Sumatra region. Yet, developers chose to implement this REDD project across 7500 km2, ~ 10% of Gaveau et al's expanded scenario region. If REDD programs are to be realized across large spatial scales (e.g., provinces/states), what factors constrain effective implementation? First, high transaction costs and investment risks appear to be major barriers to establishing carbon concessions across large, heterogeneous regions. Identifying who should receive compensation as well as negotiating transparent and effective payment arrangements, is at best challenging especially with ambiguous land use rights and government jurisdiction in Indonesia (Ebeling and Yasue 2008). Protecting fragmented forests from multiple threats of logging, agriculture, and fire is fraught with complexities; who should be held accountable for defending 65 000 km2 from fire especially during ENSO- associated droughts (Siegert et al 2001, Langner and Siegert 2008)? REDD's effectiveness will require support from people who live in and near REDD projects; Gaveau et al address only biodiversity and forest loss in their paper, but incorporating the potential effects of REDD programs on livelihoods and social dynamics is one of the most critical components of effective assessments via scenario-building and modeling (Soares-Filho et al 2006). Another major obstacle to establishing REDD across large regions is the opportunity costs of carbon concessions. Recent estimates show that profits from protecting aboveground biomass for carbon payments in Indonesian non-peat forests are far below the benefits garnered from converting these forests to plantation agriculture (Butler et al 2009). Yet in order to mitigate forest conversion as proposed by Gaveau et al, carbon must compete with alternative high-value commodities (e.g., palm oil). Although forest carbon credits currently are traded in voluntary markets, carbon prices are considerably higher in compliance markets than in voluntary markets (World Bank 2008). If the UNFCCC generates consensus in December 2009 incorporating REDD in formal market-based trading mechanisms to meet compliance targets, REDD may become a financially competitive land use option even in highly-threatened lowland forests, including those in northern Sumatra. Ultimately, REDD implementation is an iterative process, requiring regular appraisals and improvements at local (i.e., REDD projects) through international (i.e., UNFCCC) levels. The overarching value of REDD pilot initiatives such as this groundbreaking Aceh project and Gaveau et al's innovative assessments is to identify suitable approaches as well as shortcomings, allowing revised and refined efforts that will mitigate forest degradation via financial mechanisms. The next iteration of REDD program evaluations will also need to incorporate: (i) empirical measurements of carbon stock change attributed to forest degradation; (ii) evaluations of economic incentives for a diverse suite of agents such as local and urban communities as well as the private sector; and, (iii) explicitly consider the fluctuating price of carbon vis-a-vis competing commodity prices.

In this article we develop this theme by examining the difficult questions of how energy and transportation options should be selected, and who makes the choices. These are questions that require us to look critically at energy and transportation policy. To date, the response to climate change has largely relied on information and volunteerism that aim to change individual lifestyle and purchasing choices, which has had little impact in reducing GHGs. Exciting new technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells and hybrid-electric vehicles have been promoted as holding great promise for GHG reductions, but they have not yet transformed our energy system into a sustainable one. It is now clear that coordinated action is needed at the societal level. The public can have the biggest impact on climate change through its support for (or opposition to) the regional, national and international policies made by governments at all levels. Although climate change is not the only issue arising from transportation (and, more generally, our energy system), it may be one of the most difficult to address. This is because any adverse impacts are perceived to affect future generations and people in other parts of the globe, rather than us in the here and now. Our individual energy-using actions are distributed among 6.6 billion other people, and hidden as “embedded energy” in the products and foods we import into our homes. Furthermore, energy policy and infrastructure are politically fraught topics, so it is not surprising that we have had trouble reaching consensus in Canada on how to tackle rising GHG emissions. GHGs from transportation are especially difficult to tackle because the vehicular sources are numerous and mobile, as compared to large point sources like industry or power-generation plants. The transportation system affects not only the energy system and GHG emissions, but also completely different issues such as local air quality, traffic congestion, accidents, personal mobility, and social equity. In this article, we demonstrate that an effective, efficient and equitable means of tackling climate change is to put a price on GHG emissions. In essence, a successful carbon-pricing strategy will ensure that there is a direct material cost for pollution of the atmosphere","[""abstract""]"

The impact that CAT would have on the agricultural sector has received increased attention with different views among stakeholders. Farmer groups such as the National Farmers Union (NFU) have clearly expressed their support for a climate policy, believing that agriculture is part of a climate change solution (National Farmers Union, 2010). Others like the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF), however, are more concerned about the cost impact on agriculture and have remained engaged in the policy debate to assure that any final legislation does not diminish American agriculture (American Farm Bureau Federation, 2010). Understanding both the opportunities and the challenges that farmers would face under GHG CAT becomes critical with impending climate legislation in the United States. Although GHG CAT implies rising production costs for agricultural producers, many agricultural economists are optimistic. They believe that the cost impact of a CAT climate policy would be limited while its benefits or the costs of no action may be more significant. For example, in testimony to the House Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit, Energy and Research, McCarl (2009) was more focused on the opportunities enabled by climate policy, expecting that agriculture would benefit even in the absence of carbon emission offsets. Based on a “back of the envelope” calculation that indicated limited benefit and cost impacts, Babcock (2009) concluded that any disruptive change in climate would have a far greater impact on livelihood than would the carbon price. The goal of this paper is to provide a local perspective on the possible short-term impact of a CAT climate policy on agricultural producers and their potential for adjustment. It summarizes findings of an empirical study focused on a region in the Northern Great Plains that explicitly considers local farmer behavior with respect to on-farm carbon sequestration and production cost management. While several analyses have developed an overview on the agricultural impact of GHG CAT at the national level, this empirical study attempts to shed some light on the agricultural potential of adjustment to economy-wide climate change mitigation while providing a bottom-up economic analysis on some of the short-term costs and benefits to agricultural producers in the transition process.","[""abstract""]"

It is estimated that agriculture is responsible for 7% of the total GHG emissions in the United States. Currently, environmental policies to regulate GHG are in place in different countries and are expected to increase in the future. The objective of this study was to estimate carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from eight agribusiness retailers in Kansas. Data consisted of energy inputs from the operation of the agribusiness retailers and the crop land these retailers serve. Carbon emission coefficients were employed to determine carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions associated with each energy input used during their operations. Results suggest that electricity is the largest source of total carbon dioxide emissions from the retail operations followed by diesel fuel, which represents the main source of direct emissions. Nitrogen fertilizers represent the main source of emissions from crop production. Emissions from the agricultural sector will not be regulated under the current American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009 but information on their potential carbon footprint is useful knowledge. If agribusinesses were to be regulated, none of the eight retailers have locations that would be subject to the current cap and trade bill passed by the House of Representatives. But, if they were regulated and had to comply, the cost of partially offsetting their emissions by 5 to 20% would be low given estimations of future carbon prices in the literature. Even if agricultural retailers are not directly restricted, they will likely be affected by increases in energy input prices if such legislation is enacted.","[""abstract""]"

The New Zealand government is currently developing a voluntary biofuel sustainability reporting scheme. This thesis assesses the extent to which a sustainability standard could support the domestic biofuels industry, and avoid negative environmental and social impacts associated with biofuel production. It describes the current scope of the domestic biofuel industry, discusses relevant environmental and social concerns relating to biofuel production, and reviews international literature surrounding sustainable biofuel initiatives. From a study of the literature New Zealand biofuels appear more sustainable than most, although direct and indirect land-use change should be included for feedstocks from energy crops. Impacts vary across feedstocks and production methods, and each biofuel must be considered in its own merit. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were undertaken with key stakeholders from industry, relevant government agencies, non-governmental organisations, and biofuel experts to discuss the potential for a domestic biofuels sustainability standard. The majority of stakeholders interviewed supported the development of a government-led sustainability standard, which would include principles addressing greenhouse gas emissions, food security and biodiversity loss. There is good evidence to support the movement towards mandatory sustainability requirements, as soon as this is feasible. In the future, biofuels should be supported by technology-neutral policies (such as carbon-pricing) which reward their benefits, rather than indiscriminately promoting biofuels. The development of enforceable sustainability standards is crucial if biofuels are to contribute to a future low-carbon transport sector in New Zealand.","[""abstract""]"

With the U.S. out and Japan and the EU ratifying, the Protocol cannot enter into force without Russian ratification. In part, U.S. rejection of the Kyoto Protocol resulted from the fact that, had the U.S. been in, its least costly road to implementation would have involved large purchases of emissions credits from Russia. With the U.S. out, Russian credits are worth much less but Russia may be able to exploit monopoly power to increase the value of those permits, or Russia could bank permits on the expectation that prices will rise in the future, perhaps as a result of U.S. reentry into the Protocol in later periods. The Russian decision is more complex, however, in that it is also a major fossil fuel exporter. To the extent it withholds permits from the market, fossil energy prices are depressed further, and the value of its exports of energy are reduced. Thus, Russia faces a tradeoff between maximizing its permit revenue and its revenue from fossil energy exports. We develop this problem as a simple dynamic optimization problem that can be easily solved. We calibrate this simple model to the results of two CGE models (EPPA and GEMINI-E3) that fully capture interactions of energy trade, permit trade, and permit and energy prices. We show that carbon prices are relatively insensitive to Russia’s behaviors when the U.S. is assumed to participate. It also shows that, in the absence of U.S.participation, the impacts of market power by Russia & the Ukraine is largely dependent on the elasticity of demand for permits. Finally, we focus on the uncertainty about the supply of CDM by developing countries. It is shown that permits prices are relatively insensitive to CDM supply in the short run but not in the long run.","[""abstract""]"

The aim of including climate change objectives within the UNFCCC was, on the one hand, to reduce current and expected emissions from forest ecosystems, mainly due to deforestation and forest degradation and, on the other hand, to incentivise the conservation and enhancement of existing forest carbon stock, e.g., through forest conservation, sustainable forest management, afforestation and reforestation. The reporting and accounting of carbon emissions and removals from the so-called land use, land-use change and forestry sector (LULUCF) was included in a binding policy framework under the Kyoto Protocol for industrialised countries. 
Detailed rules for reporting and accounting were implemented, which have undergone amendments since the first commitment period. 
For developing countries the adoption and implementation of a corresponding system is still in progress. The so-called REDD+ system (‘reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation 
in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries’) is currently in preparation under the UNFCCC. This system aims to incentivise developing countries to implement forest-based climate change mitigation options, with a results-based financing by industrialised countries. The design of a detailed financing, monitoring, reporting and accounting framework is currently being worked out, which for developing countries is loaded with additional difficulties, given the lack of capacity and experience, insufficient data availability and weak monitoring systems. 
To guarantee global climate effectiveness, the entire forest-based climate change mitigation approach under the UNFCCC needs to be consistent. This means avoiding gaps, which could produce leakage, and insuring incentives are effective and properly aligned. These self-evident requirements are, however, not self-evidently inherent to a politicised system of such dimension and complexity. This thematic context of ‘global climate change and the role of forest ecosystems’ and of the ‘political 
agreements to fight climate change’ in industrialised and developing countries is introduced in the first part of the comprehensive summary of this cumulative dissertation. The underlying object of carbon accounting in the forest-related LULUCF sector are the natural and human-induced ‘forest dynamics of carbon uptake and release through forest growth, forest management and forest cover change’, which are summarised in the second Chapter. The details of ‘the political design for accounting of carbon uptake and release by forests’ are explained in the third part of the thematic context. Here the similarities and differences between the existing and envisaged accounting approaches between different land-use categories and mitigation activities and between industrialised and developing countries are addressed. Special attention is given to the implied incentive effect of different accounting options and the role of reference levels. 
The design and implications of different accounting approaches for the mitigation activities of forest management, afforestation and avoided deforestation are analysed by three scientific articles presented in the second part of the comprehensive summary. The first article analyses the incentive effect of different sub-national carbon accounting approaches for afforestations and forest management in industrialised countries by analysing the interactions of different carbon and timber prices and interest 
rates. The results show that additional carbon crediting, passed down directly to the forest owner, increases the optimal rotation period when carbon prices outperform timber prices. When harvests are immediately charged with debits (without including the harvested wood products’ intrinsic carbon stock), harvesting becomes uneconomic at a given price level. 
The second article addresses the land-use change activity of deforestation by analysing national patterns of forest cover development on a global scale. For globally consistent accounting of land-use changes a quantifiably comparable forest cover development among the countries would facilitate a standardised approach for the accounting of land-use changes. The study, therefore, analyses recent data from 
developing countries and historic data from industrialised countries in a multi-national regression model. Regularities in the influence of certain drivers of deforestation on the forest cover decline could be detected and empirically quantified for 140 countries. The resulting global deforestation curve was included as a method for determining reference levels for a potential future REDD+ mechanism proposed in the third article. The third study applies national data of deforesting developing countries for the prediction of a business as usual forest cover development for REDD+ reference levels. The application of this uniform global deforestation curve for a REDD+ reference level approach provides the advantage of the consideration of individual national circumstances standardised by a uniform methodology. The three articles are each summarised briefly, stating the personal contribution, and their results are discussed in the thematic context described in the first part of the comprehensive summary. 
In the final conclusions the relevance of the results of the three articles for the overall thematic context is described. The results show which major implications politically designed carbon accounting rules have on the incentive effect, and thereby on the effectiveness of climate change mitigation options. The accounting approaches have to be carefully designed and matched with each other to avoid false incentives or incentive gaps. The results also show that on the operational level competing interests may outweigh the incentives. Furthermore, the feasibility of consistent carbon accounting is discussed and the connections and similarities of the different existing approaches are depicted. The transferability of the different accounting approaches, between the various activities addressed and between industrialised and developing countries, but also the empirical quantification of a comparable forest cover development between different countries, encourages the implementation of consistent carbon accounting. Stepwise approaches are, however, needed to overcome existing data and capacity gaps.

Measuring GHG emissions is obviously important, and the new Greenhouse Gas Measurement and Management journal can contribute to the development of reliable measurement and verification metrics for GHG emissions and removals. As we pursue that objective, however, we should not make the mistake of assuming that we necessarily ‘manage what we measure’, or that all GHG measurement and management efforts are created equal in the eyes of climate change mitigation. Most of all, we should not make the mistake of assuming that better measurement is an end in and of itself. Confusing means and ends is easy to do when talking about climate change, particularly when we lack key elements of the policy framework needed to address the problem. It is easy to focus inordinately on those variables we feel we do have some control over. But climate change is a complicated and long-term problem, as is climate change mitigation. It is natural to look for proxy success indicators that are simple and measurable, like emissions disclosure efforts, emissions reduction targets, and measurement and verification protocols. Indeed, it’s important to have nearand medium-term success indicators to keep ourselves motivated. The use of proxy success indicators is not without risk. The wrong success indicators, or confusing the ends and means of climate change mitigation, can easily distract us from the long-term ‘end game’. Successful climate change mitigation would almost certainly require a combination of aggressive regulation, a material carbon price and radical technology innovation. That’s the end game. Getting from here to there will be even tougher if we lose sight of the target by focusing on the wrong proxies, or on ‘means’ rather than ‘ends’. Today, many published articles in the climate change field are little more than a presentation of better statistics relating to GHG emissions or removals, whether at the project or systems level. Such articles implicitly assume that improving the measurement of sources and sinks is an end in and of itself. Is that always true? As we launch the Greenhouse Gas Measurement and Management journal, we should recognize that this journal can make a larger contribution to the field if we always keep one eye on ‘the end game’. With that in mind, we should ask authors presenting statistically significant results to explain whether their conclusions are also policy significant, and why. For example, does an article on the improved measurement of standing forest stocks have significant implications for estimates of the country’s GHG inventory, how we think about other countries’ GHG inventories, or how we think about carbon sequestration potentials in the country? When an author estimates the mitigation potential of a particular technology, does the author provide crucial information on the cost-effectiveness of that technology as a mitigation strategy, and how that played into estimating its perceived potential? In other words, do the findings in a given article improve our larger understanding of how to advance the cause of climate change mitigation? Do the results being published have the potential to contribute to better policy decision making in the future? In other words, are the improvements ‘policy significant’, as opposed to just ‘statistically significant’?

Conservation practices have the potential to exploit this link, as their implementation is found to reduce fluxes of GHGs and nonpoint source (NPS) water pollution. Several studies have recognized this link and have documented the potential to improve environmental quality through the use of programs which retire land, the cost of which can be offset by the sale of carbon credits. However, the ability to use land for both agricultural production and environmental conservation is important. As such, this study provides a novel analytical framework that is used to examine the potential for implementing agricultural conservation practices to reduce NPS water pollutants and fluxes of GHGs in a working-lands setting. The extent to which carbon pricing can affect practice implementation costs and the optimal distribution of these practices throughout the watershed is also explored. Results from this study indicate that carbon offsets can sharply reduce conservation practice implementation costs and therefore have the potential to reduce greater amounts of NPS pollution for a given cost of implementation. This conclusion has significant implications for policymaking, particularly with regard to using market mechanisms to improve water quality in watersheds where markets have historically been unsuccessful. However, this study found that the optimal allocation of practices was heavily reliant on fertilizer management, which is difficult to enforce in practice.","[""abstract""]"

Organic farming, especially organic paddy farming, showed that some functions like fostering water resources, accumulating soil carbon, conserving biodiversity, and preventing accidents from pesticides were higher than conventional paddy farming, while for the others were similar. The fostering water resources function was evaluated as 4,297 ton/ha.year an increase of about 3.6% compare with that of conventional farming. A New function for accumulating soil carbon at organic paddy fields has been assessed by 4.67 ton/ha in terms of long periods over 10 years.

Our spatial projections of future deforestation incorporate topography, accessibility, protected status, potential agricultural revenue, and a robust observed inverted-U-shaped trajectory of forest cover loss with respect to remaining forest cover. We project that in the absence of new forest conservation policies, 289 million hectares of tropical forest will be cleared from 2016-2050—an area about the size of India and one-seventh of Earth’s tropical forest area in the year 2000. We project that this tropical deforestation will release 169 GtCO2 to the atmosphere from 2016-2050—one-sixth of the remaining carbon that can be emitted if the rise in Earth’s temperature is to be likely held below 2 °C. We estimate that a universally applied carbon price of $20/tCO2 from 2016-2050 would avoid 41 GtCO2 of emissions from tropical deforestation while a carbon price of $50/tCO2 would avoid 77 GtCO2. These prices correspond to average costs to land users of $9/tCO2 and $21/tCO2 respectively. By comparison if all tropical countries implemented anti-deforestation policies as effective as those in the Brazilian Amazon post-2004 then 60 GtCO2 of emissions would be avoided. Our analysis corroborates the conclusions of previous studies that reducing tropical deforestation is a sizable and low-cost option for mitigating climate change. In contrast to previous studies, we project that the amount of emissions that can be avoided at low-cost by reducing tropical deforestation will increase rather than decrease in future decades. Encouragingly, 89% of potential low-cost emission reductions are located in the 47 tropical countries that have already signaled their intention to reduce emissions from deforestation in exchange for performance-based finance (REDD+).","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This paper presents the results of a Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored analysis examining the impact that future carbon prices could have on a nominal 50,000 barrel per day (BPD) Illinois CTL plant. The first phase of the paper presents the results of two CTL plant designs: one with and one without carbon sequestration. Basic information on the plant layouts, performance, cost, carbon emissions, financial results (without placing a value on CO2), and major sensitivities provides the basis for subsequent analysis. The second phase discusses the major CO2 regulatory policies being evaluated in the 110 Congress, and how these policies, by placing a value on CO2, could impact the financial performance of CTL plants. Two different methods are undertaken for estimating CO2 cost: a range of flat prices throughout the life of each project, and a ramp-up of CO2 price during the performance period, reflecting the potential for tighter emissions regulations in 2020 and beyond. These costs are entered into the base case financial models for each CTL plant design. The results show the expected return on investment for each project under a range of CO2 price scenarios, and what CO2 price(s) would be necessary to economically justify the sequestration of CO2. Preliminary results at a $0/ton value for CO2 show an ROI for the CTL plant without capture at 15.3% and an ROI of 12.0% once compression and sequestration is included. A flat CO2 price of $12.50/ton throughout the life of the plant would be required to justify the additional expenditure on the CTL plant with capture. In the alternate CO2 price scenario, a government target to stabilize CO2 concentrations at 550 ppm or lower would be necessary to provide a sufficient economic driver for CO2 capture from CTL plants. Of the 5 major CO2 reduction policies being considered in the US Senate as of April 2007, only one, Sanders-Boxer, would provide a clear price signal to support CTL plants with carbon capture and storage. This information is relevant to a complete understanding for how CO2 regulations could impact this emerging US industry. Project developers considering CTL plants today will likely want to consider including the necessary technology for CO2 capture and compression since the marginal cost is small relative to other large fossil fuel plants.","[""abstract""]"

For decades, policy-makers and international agreements have sought to achieve this goal through energy efficiency, lowcarbon technology, carbon pricing, and other measures designed to reduce demand for fossil fuels. Focusing on the point of combustion makes intuitive sense, but efforts have yet to put fossil fuel use on a trajectory consistent with keeping global warming below 2°C. Recognizing this shortcoming, policy-makers, researchers and activists have begun to look at the potential for policies and actions aimed at limiting fossil fuel supply. However, options for supply-side climate policies and how they might complement or replace more traditional demand side policies remain poorly understood. This paper explores reasons why supply-side policies have not been pursued and why they deserve more attention. It provides a typology of supply-side policies and frameworks for assessing their effectiveness, efficiency, and feasibility. It finds that supply-side policies, such as removal of producer subsidies, compensation of resource owners for leaving fuels “unburned”, or outright restrictions on resource development, could bring important benefits. Such policies could allow for greater emission reductions at the same (or lower) cost than demandside policies alone. They could also help to reduce carbon lock-in effects, making it easier for lower-carbon alternatives to compete with fossil fuels. Many questions related to feasibility and effectiveness remain. Further research and policy development can help address these questions and explore how a new supply-side policy “toolkit” might complement demand-side approaches.","[""abstract""]"

It has set clear targets for emission reductions consistent with international goals of limiting global warming and has pioneered statutory underpinning of target-setting. On the international stage, it has been an active protagonist of a global deal to limit human-induced climate change. The new Government has endorsed the direction of previous policies in this area and is introducing further measures, despite heavy fiscal pressures. The United Kingdom is likely to reduce emissions by more than its near-term domestic targets and its target under the Kyoto Protocol, outperforming many OECD countries in the latter respect. But some of the success has been due to ‘one-off’ factors such as the ‘dash for gas’, reductions in non-CO2 greenhouse gases in the 1990s and the recent recession, rather than explicit climate-change policies. The pace of decarbonisation of the power sector has been slow and the spread of renewable energy technologies limited. Implicit carbon prices vary across sectors, and should be harmonized to increase the cost efficiency of policy. The unevenness partly reflects the way in which policies have proliferated and overlap and a simplified structure would be desirable. A step–change in the pace of emission reductions is required to put the UK on the path towards its ambitious 2050 target. Given the central role of the EU emissions trading scheme, a key element of the UK strategy should be to seek tighter quotas within the EU scheme. Preparations to adapt to climate impacts also need to be stepped up, focusing on the provision of more information, better risk-assessment frameworks and more advanced metrics for monitoring and evaluation of adaptation planning. This paper relates to the 2011 Economic Survey of the United Kingdom (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/uk) La politique climatique au Royaume-Uni Le Royaume-Uni, qui a entrepris d’adopter des mesures de reduction des emissions de gaz a effet de serre a une date relativement precoce, met aujourd’hui en oeuvre une panoplie complete de mesures.

Sur la scene internationale, il a joue un role actif en faveur d’un accord mondial visant a limiter le changement climatique d’origine anthropique.

Most jurisdictions employ a combination of the two with pricing measures generally preferred by economists. Where carbon is priced this is typically achieved by imposing a carbon tax and/or an emissions trading scheme (“ETS�?). Australia introduced a nationwide ETS from 1 July 2012 with California (and Quebec) following suit from 1 January 2013. The Australian ETS was set to link with that of the European Union (“EU�?) from 1 July 2014 and linkage with New Zealand was also being explored. Meanwhile California and Quebec linked 6 months earlier. The first tentative steps towards a global carbon market seemed to be underway. However political expediency was to see the Australian opposition party rally against the ETS and, with its subsequent election to government, repeal the regime. The prime mechanism to achieve Australia’s emissions reductions commitment is now an emissions reduction fund (“ERF�?). Under this scheme the government holds “reverse auctions�? whereby the cheapest emissions reduction proposals put to it by industry are funded. Under a “safeguard�? measure large emitters are to remain subject to emissions caps with default (possibly) leading to fines where credits cannot be sourced elsewhere. Thus carbon pricing and (limited) trading will still feature under the revised Australian regime. The circumstances leading to the implementation and then demise of the Australian ETS and its replacement with the ERS are explored in this paper. Both the former ETS and ERS will be compared with the Californian ETS. It will be observed that a myopic focus on domestic emissions is a feature of both the Californian and new Australian regimes. Whilst political expediency and, possibly, environmental integrity concerns might motivate this dislike of foreign credits one effect is that emissions reductions are likely to come at a much higher cost and the regimes fail the opportunity to assist in curtailing developing world emissions. On the flip side, both regimes are then quarantined from the mistakes and market failures of the global market. With the expectation that the Australian ERS experiment will be short lived the prospect is that Australia will again embrace an ETS. This might serve as an opportunity to reorientate the focus on international linkage from Europe to California.","[""abstract""]"

This paper had two objectives: (1) to determine the economic benefits and optimal rotation periods for timber production when coupled to carbon sequestration, as predicted by time series prediction models for Pinus tabulaeformis plantations in China; and (2) to evaluate how different carbon prices and interest rates affected optimal rotation periods using the forest land expectation value. The results suggested that time series prediction models were valuable for estimating timber volumes and carbon sequestrations based on surveys of different-aged stands. Importantly, since integrating carbon sequestrations into timber production benefits did not increase optimal rotation periods, this should promote P. tabulaeformis plantation management. In the sensitivity analysis, a higher carbon price increased the profitability of carbon sequestration and timber production, but not optimal rotation periods, though they were reduced under higher interest rates. In conclusion, incorporating both timber production and carbon sequestration benefits would sharply increase forest-based revenues, while realizing the carbon sequestration potential of P. tabulaeformis plantations. This approach was clearly useful to the development of reforestation/afforestation projects trying to mitigate climate change and also provided a theoretical basis for sustainable forest management.","[""abstract""]"

While national carbon markets have remained politically deadlocked in the US and Canada, particularly promising regional schemes have appeared, an international linkage has been established between California and QuA©bec, and more programs and linkages are under way. Despite of some criticism, ambitious carbon markets promise to minimize compliance costs and achieve pre-set targets accurately. In addition, linkages between sub-national schemes can increase the economic efficiency and environmental effectiveness, and help in developing national or even international carbon markets from the bottom-up. But, effectiveness and efficiency alone do not suffice. Social justice was one of the founding principles of sustainability; it has become an increasingly important issue in climate policy, and recent policy debates have been forced to reconsider questions such as electricity price effects and the use of carbon pricing revenues. As research on the sustainability of regional carbon market linkages in North America is virtually non-existent, in our chapter we ask if and how these linkages can foster efficient, effective and fair climate policy in the US and Canada. We do so by, first, reviewing the arguments on efficient and effective carbon market design and linking and then adding a social justice component. Second, we give an overview of established and upcoming carbon markets in Canada and the US and identify the chances and barriers of linking. Third, we evaluate the programs based on sustainability criteria and analyze the prospects for linking. We show that North America has a new historic chance to act as a role model for sustainable climate policy developed from the bottom-up by linking sub-national carbon markets.","[""abstract""]"

Adaptive responses in the agriculture and forestry sectors will be important for maintaining productivity growth and international competitiveness in response to climate change impacts and new policy environments. Reduced land clearing and expansion of forestry areas are important in reducing growth in Australia's greenhouse gas emissions and increasing terrestrial carbon sequestration. While progress is being made in resolving measurement and compliance issues associated with including agriculture and land use in the proposed domestic emissions trading scheme, these sectors have a considerable opportunity for early involvement in the scheme as providers of offsets. Incorporating agriculture and land use sector emission permits or offset obligations in the proposed emissions trading scheme will be a challenge. Alternative approaches that place emissions reporting obligations downstream at the point of processing of farm products warrant consideration. Preliminary analysis indicates that the indirect impacts of potential carbon pricing on on-farm costs are likely to be modest given that the shares of emission intensive farm inputs in total farm costs are relatively low. There is a growing need for research into the biophysical and economic impacts of climate change, and into alternative adaptation and mitigation options and their cost effectiveness.","[""abstract""]"

Due to the complex nature of the process involved, while it converts heavier oils into high quality oil products, fuels and other high value products, it also provides a way to curb carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. As refineries are profit-seeking businesses, this paper used linear programming (LP) models to assess the impact of different taxation amounts on CO 2 emissions on a refinery's operational configuration, and energy using strategies for a refining expansion project in Taiwan, and to discover what the carbon price should be in order to justify the required changes. The result reveals the necessity of developing processes, such as the Delayed Coking (DCU) process combined with hydrotreating, to produce high-quality fuels and petrochemical products in the refinery. Our findings indicate that this anticipated expansion plan reduced CO 2 emissions by 4.92%, while obtaining an efficiency of 14.46 USD/ton-CO 2 at a cost of 30 USD/ton-CO 2 , and by 10.33% and 25.22% CO 2 emission with efficiency gains of 15.22 and 78.61 USD/ton-CO 2 at a cost of 90 and 180 USD/ton-CO 2, respectively. When emission costs are over 90 USD/ton-CO 2 , the refinery opts for liquid petroleum gas (LPG) instead of burning fuel oil, since using hydrogen as a makeup fuel only proves beneficial when the CO 2 emission costs are over 150 USD/ton-CO 2 .","[""abstract""]"

While the 20th century saw massive increases in agricultural productivity over most of the world, sub-Saharan Africa was largely bypassed. In many respects, catching up in the 21st century poses more difficult challenges than were faced in the 20th -- with the novel challenges of climate change, soil degradation, and the closing agricultural frontier being chief among them. Solutions are required that profitably improve productivity, strengthen and/or rebuild soil fertility, and do so within the limits imposed by a warming and carbon-constrained world. This will be needed if the region is to shake off the stagnation that has characterized it for the past century, and contribute to solving to the global challenges posed by the coming century.This dissertation focuses on one potential solution -- biochar -- and follows it from agronomic efficacy, to preliminary economic analysis, to rigorous trial in the field. As such, it seeks to be an example of the interdisciplinary approach that I argue is needed to guide the development, deployment, and scaling of solutions to problems in the environment/development space.The first chapter is a meta-analysis of crop yield response to biochar. Using data from 84 studies, I (and co-authors) employ meta-analytical, missing data, and semiparametric statistical methods to explain heterogeneity in crop yield responses across different soils, biochars, and agricultural management factors, and then estimate potential changes in yield across different soil environments globally. We find that soil cation exchange capacity and organic carbon were strong predictors of yield response, with low cation exchange and low carbon associated with positive response. We also find that yield response increases over time since initial application, compared to non-biochar controls. High reported soil clay content and low soil pH were weaker predictors of higher yield response. No biochar parameters in our dataset -- biochar pH, percentage carbon content, or temperature of pyrolysis -- were significant predictors of yield impacts. Projecting our fitted model onto a global soil database, we find the largest potential increases in areas with highly weathered soils, such as those characterizing much of the humid tropics. Richer soils characterizing much of the world's important agricultural areas appear to be less likely to benefit from biochar.The second chapter is a preliminary economic analysis of biochar's potential in two contexts -- rural western Kenya, and northern Vietnam. Using recall-based datasets from smallholder farmers, I (and co-authors) estimate yields as a function of biochar and fertilizer use. We find an positive association between biochar use and average yields in Kenya, but no correlation in Vietnam. We then use these estimates to calculate optimal input mixes under hypothetical biochar and carbon prices, given heterogeneity in response both to biochar and fertilizer, and heterogeneous budget constraints. In Kenya, we find that biochar is more-likely-than-not to be profitable to adopt for 23\% of our sample if unsubsidized and available at its current sale price of around \$188/ton, while a hypothetical carbon subsidy of \$100/ton CO$_2$e increases this proportion to 47\%, though these proportions are not different from zero at 95\% confidence. Because of limited short-term complementarity between biochar and inorganic fertilizer, we estimate that biochar adoption would change profits little, given budget constraints for agricultural inputs. We conclude that carbon subsidies may have a marginal impact on biochar's profitability in Western Kenya, but that further research is needed to improve the precision of these estimates, extend them to account for any longer-term changes in soil characteristics that might impact biochar's profitability, and account for any potential biases stemming from time-varying variables that not measured or modeled in the context of this study.The third chapter reports the results of a Kenyan field experiment on adoption and impact of biochar, which was motivated by the encouraging findings of the previous two studies. In addition to technical efficacy, I sought to determine what mix of policies might most effectively speed biochar dissemination, given the slow pace of technological change in African agriculture over the past several decades. I randomly assigned prices, demonstrations, and risk-free trials. Yields increased by 37\% and 50\% in the first two seasons, and response to inorganic fertilizer improved. However, uptake was 2.6\% and 10\% respectively. Farmers were highly price-sensitive. Social network effects were marginally significant, but positive at low penetration and negative at high penetration. Given uptake well below the social optimum, subsidies for biochar appear justified from a social cost/benefit standpoint. The dissertation closes with a short discussion of lessons learned, and ways forward for further applied research.","[""abstract""]"

Facts prove that forest cover decreases have caused climate change and various disasters such as flood, landslide, drought, extreme weather, and others. Efforts to address climate change have been made by the international community through greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction programs with avoided deforestation and forest degradation through the afforestation/reforestation clean development mechanism (A/R CDM), reducing emission from deforestation and degradation (REDD+), joint implementation (JI), and voluntary carbon market (VCM) schemes. These programs are closely related with carbon trading. Carbon markets need a unit of trade. For carbon, this is one ton of greenhouse gas emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO 2 e). That is why measurement of forest biomass is very important. Methods to estimate forest biomass from models, inventory, remote sensing data, and geographical information system are being developed, evaluated, and demonstrated at several pilot regions in the world. Carbon markets are believed to be effective and efficient mechanisms in providing these financing sources. In carbon markets, prices are decisive in generating carbon credits. Higher carbon prices will cause more carbon credits to be generated. Nevertheless, carbon trading from REDD+ is found to be a concern especially for developing countries that is the risk of leakage and non-permanence. This chapter aims to inform the importance of measuring forest biomass as it is used as the basis for carbon accounting on carbon trading.","[""abstract""]"

Background Agricultural policy support can be defined as the gross transfer to agriculture from consumers and taxpayers (OCDE, 2016). When governments decide to apply policy distortions to a given crop, they create incentives (or disincentives) that drive economic decisions and lead to increase (or decrease) crop/grassland areas. Different crops generate distinct emissions (sequestrations) of greenhouse gases. Thus, governments also influence greenhouse gas emissions and climate change through their agricultural policies. The Food an Agricultural Organization (FAO) projects the growth of the world demand for food to be between 15% and 40% in the coming decades. Brazil is one of the largest food suppliers in the world and has the potential to expand its production capacity, increasing its agricultural production by 30% by 2030. At the same time, Brazil signed the Paris Climate Change Agreement in December 2015 (COP 21) proposing a reduction of its national GHG emissions by 2030. The Brazilian government intends therefore to strengthen its low-carbon agriculture, restoring 15 million hectares of degraded pastures, and implementing an integrated production system in another 5 million hectares by 2030. 2. Objective and relevance of the research The general objective of this research is to contribute to bridging the gap and expanding the boundary of knowledge about the relationship between agricultural policy support and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in Brazil. The relationship and mutual influences between the two variables is particularly interesting in the context of the application of the Paris Agreement, as their analysis allows to check the consistency of agricultural policy measures with the climate change mitigation commitment of the Brazilian government. Given the relative importance of Brazilian agriculture in the economy of the country and the weight Brazil carries in the global climate change negotiations, this research assumes particular relevance. 3. Methodology and data The paper investigates the relationships between support for agricultural products and GHG emission in Brazil, applying the Josling et al. (2016) methodology, that has already been applied by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in Jamaica. The policy support data, and specifically the Producer Single Commodity Transfer (PSCT) indicator, the production value at the farm gate, and the value of production (VoP) were collected from the Agrimonitor database. Agrimonitor is an IDB initiative meant to carry out agricultural policy analyses in Latin America and the Caribbean, using the Producer Support Estimate (PSE) methodology, developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The System for Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals Estimates (SEEG) provided instead the GHG statistics. SEEG uses several sources to estimate GHG emissions for Brazil, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines (SEEG, 2017). Some examples of sources are the Brazilian Inventories of Anthropogenic Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Removals (prepared by the Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation (MCTI)), government reports, institutes, research centers, sector entities and non-governmental organizations. The Center for Sustainability Studies at the Getulio Vargas Foundation (GVces) provided simulated carbon price. After mapping the Agrimonitor database to the SEEG database for the period 19952016, we construct several indices for the commodities included in Agrimonitor for Brazil: beef, maize, milk, pigmeat, poultry, sugar, rice, and soybeans. The first index, the Agricultural Carbon Equivalent (ACE) allows to express carbon emissions linked to the agricultural sector in monetary terms. The second, the Net Output Value (NOV) index allows the analysis of the net contributions of major Brazilian agricultural commodities to the economy. The third index, the ACE%, shows the percentage of value generated by the specific commodities that is offset by ACE. Finally, the Net Social Value (NSV) index captures how much each unit of environmental cost is related to net revenues. 4. Preliminary results and potential for generating discussion Preliminary results show that beef and milk have the highest environmental costs and generate the lowest value per unit of environmental cost. The adoption of technology in recent years is, however, reducing their environmental impact. Soybeans and maize are associated with the lowest environmental costs and produce higher values per unit of environmental costs. As a result, policy efforts aiming to the mere reduction of GHG emissions should focus on the support to and promotion of soybeans and maize instead of beef and milk. These results are likely to generate a stimulating discussion during the session as their application to actual policy making would entail a complicated priority definition. GHG emission and their reduction in the agricultural sector are strictly linked to several other economic and social variables and objectives, which might not be coherent among them. An interesting and challenging debate is therefore expected to take place on these issues and their relative importance in policy making.

This assessment should be undertaken as a matter of urgency, and disproportionately negative impacts should be assessed and addressed as appropriate. This paper aims to contribute to this discussion by reviewing the state-of-the-art research on the economic impacts of greenhouse gas mitigation measures on states, using model-based analysis. Specifically, the paper: (i) identifies four areas of economic impacts and their relationships, (ii) compiles the latest findings on the estimated magnitudes of these impacts, and (iii) presents relevant modeling approaches along with best practices for selecting and applying these approaches in impact assessments. The paper concludes that introducing greenhouse gas mitigation measures, such as carbon prices applied to bunker fuels in the range of 10 to 50 USD/ton of carbon dioxide, might increase maritime transport costs by 0.4 percent to 16 percent. However, this would only marginally increase the import prices of goods (by less than 1 percent). For transport choices, the increased cost of maritime transport induced by greenhouse gas mitigation measures might only slightly reduce the share of maritime transport, by 0.16 percent globally. Furthermore, a global carbon tax applied to all transport modes might stimulate a shift toward maritime transport from all other modes. The impacts of a carbon price in the range of 10 to 90 USD/ton of carbon dioxide on national economies are expected to be modest (-0.002 percent to -1 percent of GDP).","[""abstract""]"

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technically feasible technology that reduces greenhouse gas emissions in existing industries by reducing high-concentration carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from large point sources, and is recognized as a key factor for reaching international climate change targets. Alberta hosts two commercial-scale CCS projects jointly funded by the provincial government and private industry, but there are no additional projects for the foreseeable future. CCS deployment is often obstructed by high project costs and risks in developing an emerging technology to commercial scale. This research reexamines CCS in Alberta and provides governments with the opportunity to consider complementary policies for CCS deployment that can benefit Albertans as a whole. This research presents a Multiple Account Benefit-Cost Analysis of carbon capture and storage projects in Alberta, from the perspective of Albertans. There is a significant cost to private firms and industry to invest in CCS. However, as carbon prices escalate to $50 per tonne by 2022, CCS becomes more economical for the cement industry, hydrogen processing, ammonia and chemical production. When impacts in the taxpayer, environment, social, and economic activity accounts are considered, there is an overall benefit to Albertans in using CCS to reduce emissions. However, public perception of CCS projects remains a crucial factor. To reduce barriers to CCS development and increase investment in CCS, a policy strategy is needed. The policy strategy needs to address both the market failures that lead to emissions and underinvestment in research. Therefore, in addition to carbon pricing, environmental taxation such as tax credits specifically for CCS projects can encourage research and development. To also signal government support to the public and investors, existing provincial and federal government incentives for low-carbon and clean-energy projects should extend to include CCS in both the industrial and power sectors.","[""abstract""]"

The model is then applied to a case study and the main findings are as follows: (1) carbon tax policy will have a positive effect on the CCS investment. If the carbon price is not high enough to trigger CCS investment, a hybrid mechanism integrating carbon trading and carbon tax to stimulate CCS investment is required; (2) in applying the trinomial tree real options model, the optimal carbon tax rate should be 145.3 RMB/ton for supercritical pulverized coal (SCPC) (or 79.54 RMB/ton for integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)) plants under current market condition and at current technological levels; (3) the optimal carbon tax rate is sensitive to uncertainties. Specifically, the optimal tax rate depends largely on not only the cost of the CCS investment but also the portfolio of carbon price volatility and the initial carbon price level.

We then represent a version of the technology in the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model to see how it competes with other low carbon options under stabilization scenarios. We find that, with a global price on carbon designed to achieve climate stabilization goals, the technology could make a substantial contribution to energy supply and emissions reduction in the second half of the 21st century. The main uncertainties weighing on bioelectricity with carbon capture and storage are biomass availability at large scale, the pace of improvements in carbon capture technologies, the availability and cost of CO2 storage, and social acceptance. Commercial viability would appear to depend strongly on a policy environment, such as carbon pricing, that would advantage it, given the technology costs we assume. Compared to previous studies, we provide a consistent approach to evaluate all of the components of the technology, from growing biomass to CO2 storage assessment. Our results show that global economic costs and needed carbon prices to hit the stabilization target are substantially lower with the technology available at reasonable costs.","[""abstract""]"

The work was done in the context of increasing the resilience of businesses to current climate variability as well as to projected changes in climate. The project also identified potential synergies and conflicts between improved business performance, climate adaptation practices and greenhouse gas emissions management. 
Three regions (Qld Gulf, Fitzroy Basin and Victoria River District) evaluated climate adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation options via a benchmarking and options analysis approach with three “focal” properties. Five indicators of performance were evaluated for each property – profitability, productivity, land condition, climate change risk and greenhouse gas emissions. These detailed business analyses were complemented by demonstration sites in each region. Two other regions (Qld Mitchell grasslands and NT Barkly Tablelands) used on-property demonstration sites to showcase promising climate adaptation practices identified in a previous project. 
The focal property approach provided a systematic process for assessing current business performance as well as a ready means of estimating the impacts of management changes. For example, over a 15 year period, the Qld Gulf focal property improved its pasture condition dramatically by stocking around the long-term carrying capacity and undertaking wet season spelling. This, combined with herd management improvements, increased profitability and productivity, reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 15%, and improved greenhouse gas emission efficiency by >100%. 
The demonstration sites in each region effectively promoted and documented the benefits of key grazing practices for improving resilience to both current climate variability and potential climate change. For example, on a 16,118km² property in the Barkly, a paddock demonstration has documented initial land condition recovery at old bores, and the reduced risk of overgrazing around new bores, through best practice stocking rate management and wet season spelling. 
Qualitative analyses showed that many of the adaptation practices identified for improving resilience are consistent with existing best practice recommendations aimed at improving productivity and sustainability. Furthermore, these adaptation practices appear to have largely neutral implications for greenhouse gas emissions. In contrast, practices and options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions were more likely to create conflicts that leave enterprises more vulnerable to climate change. Examples of the negative consequences of mitigation measures include reduced pasture production associated with increased carbon sequestration in trees (i.e. woody vegetation thickening or regrowth retention) and increased operating costs associated with carbon pricing (if these are not offset with carbon credits). 
The project demonstration sites and focal property benchmarking process provided a solid base for focussed extension work targeting the drivers of profit, land condition, greenhouse gas emissions intensity and climate adaptation strategies.","[""abstract""]"

Deforestation and forest degradation are the second largest contributor of carbon into the atmosphere, after the use of fossil fuels by industry and transportation. As lungs of the world, forest is enable to produce renewable energy sources i.e. biomass. Forest carbon stock in above ground biomass (AGB) is the greatest effect source on deforestation and forest degradation. Therefore, it is necessary to perform a study the potential of carbon in forest. The purpose of this research is to determine carbon stock value in Batang Gadis National Park, Mandailing Natal Regency, North Sumatera Province, Indonesia. The carbon potential stored in this forest vegetation is calculated using AGB allometric equation by using data in diameter at breast height (dbh = 1.3 m), height, and density of the wood for trees. Data obtained from secondary data is Asset Assessment Report which State Controlled Forest Natural Resources Batang Gadis National Park, 2016.

In the Middle East solar power plants are built for prices around 3 cent per kilowatt-hour and bids below 3 cent have been placed. In Europe wind energy is the second largest source of renewable energy after biomass. Although, wind farms are being built without subsidy the total cost of a wind farm is much higher in the order of 14 cent per kWh and it can decrease to 10 cent by 2030. In this research an concept study for the transport of electric energy is made to find an answer to the question: “is it possible to ship electric energy which is delivered in a port between areas of generation and consumption over a fixed distance with the use of a ship and deliver it for a levelised cost of electricity (LCoE) which is competitive in the market of unloading.” The cost of a kilowatt-hour of electric energy in the Dutch market is 8.33 if it is produced by a modern gas fired power plant and if the cost for CO2 emissions are included according to the current prices in the European emission trading scheme. If higher carbon cost scenario's are applied the price could increase to prices over 17 cent per kilowatt-hour. The concepts in this study are tested against four different carbon emission cost scenario's ranging from 8 euro/tCO2 to 190 euro/tCO2 Most electrical energy is transported by electric energy power grids. For long distance high volume energy transmission a high voltage direct current energy cable is the most efficient way to transport energy but at larger distances the transmission system gets more expensive. In this research the electric cable is used as a reference case which the concept has to outperform. To test the concepts a non-linear model is made which is solved with Matlab-integrated solvers to find the optimal transport concept. The model works by optimising the main dimensions of the ship. With this optimal ship design concepts are analysed. For this research: a concept based on a hydrogen-carrier (ammonia) and a concept based on thermal energy storage are discussed. . The hydrogen-carrier concept uses ammonia as a carrier. Ammonia has a high energy content and can be produced with the Haber Bosch process or with Solid State Ammonia Synthesis (SSAS). If the energy is produced using the well known Haber-Bosch process in 2018 the levelised cost of energy is 21.2 and 24.2 cent per kilowatt hour depending on the distance. Developments in the field of electrolysers will reduce the capital investment which can reduce the price to 17.8 to 20.8 cent per kilowatt hour by 2025 if the energy is supplied at 2 cent per kilowatt hour to the ammonia production facility. The SSAS method offers higher energy effincies at lower capital investment cost. The LCOE calculated in this research is 11.4 to 16.4 cent per kilowatt-hour. The thermal energy storage concept is based on molten salt. Molten salt is being used in concentrated solar power plants as a storage of energy. In the concept used in this project the molten salt is transported to another part where the heat which is stored in the salt is used to generate electricity. The LCoE is already 28.5 cent per kilowatt-hour at a distance of 1,000 nm. The thermal energy storage concept is more expensive than the ammonia concept. Depending on the distance and the carbon cost scenario's the concept can be competitive to the fixed connection with a cable and fossil fired power plants in the home market. If the low cost carbon scenario's (1 and 2) are applied by law makers the concept of electrical energy by sea is not competitive but if politicians would decide to increase the cost for carbon emissions the transport could become competitive. When the carbon emission cost increase to values over 100 euro/tCO2 the SSAS concept is competitive for distance up to 2,000 nm but it still more expensive than a cable connection. For this distances larger than 4,000 nm and carbon prices according to the 4th scenario (190 euro/tCO2) the SSAS-based concept can be a competitive energy supplier.","[""abstract""]"

Indigenous people own and or manage much of the tropical savanna estate across WA, NT and Queensland and are well placed to provide services in the form of greenhouse gas sequestration and abatement. The emerging carbon offsets market provides new livelihood opportunities for Indigenous people such as through savanna fire abatement, forest management and avoided deforestation, grazing land management and revegetation. How these opportunities are realised will be strongly influenced by climate change policy developments at the international and national levels and the quality of science underpinning offset estimation and verification. In particular, a framework to replace the Kyoto Protocol post 2012 should seek a more comprehensive approach to accounting for land based mitigation activities, and permit greenhouse gas accounting rules and definitions that are more regionally appropriate to the tropical savannas. Further uncertainty surrounds the introduction of a carbon price into Australian climate change policy, and the future of domestic offsets under the proposed Carbon Farming Initiative. It is important that stakeholders in northern Australia understand the implications of negotiations at the national and international level and the risks associated with different policy scenarios. Similarly, climate change policy needs to manage the goal of emissions reduction with Indigenous aspirations, making necessary the full engagement of Indigenous land managers in the planning and implementation phases of policy development and offset projects. Ethically, it is important that government agencies seeking to meet emissions reductions targets through constraining land use development, adequately support and compensate Indigenous people for any opportunity costs associated with development forgone on their lands. This thesis examines the current settings and future scenarios for climate change policy in savannas of northern Australia, and explores some of the opportunities and risks for Indigenous land managers wishing to engage in the carbon offset market.","[""abstract""]"

This is an important milestone. But one that still leaves the majority of global GHG emissions unpriced. The global nature of climate change creates challenges for a policy regime that covers only a subset of the sources contributing to the problem. If these incomplete policies induce a reallocation of economic activity from regulated to unregulated jurisdictions, the associated “leakage” of GHG emissions can offset emissions reductions and undermine cost effectiveness. Thus, concerns about emissions leakage loom large in debates about regional climate change policy. Correctly identifying the kinds of economic activities most at risk of carbon leakage is a critical first step in the design of effective risk mitigation. In this short paper, a simple formulation of emissions leakage provides a conceptual framework for leakage risk assessment in theory and practice. We briefly summarize current approaches to assessing leakage risk and highlight a sizable gap between academic research and realworld policy implementation. An emerging research agenda that aims to close this gap is discussed.","[""abstract""]"

Moreover, the UK current energy policy, the Electricity Market Reform (EMR), has a strong focus on the security, affordability and decarbonisation of the energy system. 
In order to determine the optimal operation strategy from a techno-economics aspect under the EMR in the energy system, a Combined Economic and Emission Dispatch (CEED) model is investigated to solve the optimization problem in the energy system. This is able to find a security and affordability solution for the energy system. In addition, a wind-storage combined system (WSCS) is incorporated in the model. Furthermore, the Carbon Price Floor (CPF) and an Emission Performance Standard (EPS) are applied to model the support of EMR. 
The research in this thesis is progressive. The CEED model is investigated for a steady state energy system with conventional and wind power. Then the investigated model is developed to a dynamic state model; additionally, the dynamic model takes into account WSCS, which is in order to reduce renewable power uncertainty and the possible cost of waste and reserve power; finally, practical cases are studied using the model. 
To conclude, increasing the CPF at a low emission limit leads to an increase in the cost of an electrical system, but the increasing cost rate is mitigated by decreasing the emission limit. Furthermore, the CPF is able to dominate the dispatch at high emission limits. Nevertheless, at low emission limits, the EPS has a high impact on the dispatch. In addition, the renewable power has the superiority in both the economics and environment for a mid to long-term strategy for the UK. Moreover, the benefit of the WSCS is noticeable in economics, emissions and robustness.","[""abstract""]"

The price of carbon offset credits is used for incentivizing a reduction in the release of CO2 emissions and an increase in sequestration of atmospheric CO2 through forestry activities. Forestland owners essentially have two options for creating carbon offset credits: (1) avoid or delay harvest of mature timber; or (2) harvest timber and allow natural regeneration or regeneration with ‘regular’ or genetically-enhanced growing stock, storing carbon in post-harvest products, using sawmill and potentially logging residues to generate electricity. In this study, a model representative of the Quesnel Timber Supply Area (TSA) in the BC interior is developed. The objective is to maximize net discounted returns to commercial timber operations (and sale of downstream products) plus the benefits of managing carbon fluxes. The model tracks carbon in living trees, organic matter, and, importantly, post-harvest carbon pools and avoided emissions from substituting wood for non-wood in construction or wood bioenergy for fossil fuels. Model constraints ensure that commercial forest management is sustainable, while carbon prices incentivize sequestration to ensure efficient mitigation of climate change. The results are confirmed more generally by comparing the carbon fluxes derived from the integrated forest management model with those from a Faustmann-Hartman rotation age model that explicitly includes benefits of storing carbon. One other question is addressed: If carbon offsets are created when wood biomass substitutes for fossil fuels in power generation, can one count the saved emissions from steel/cement production when wood substitutes for non-wood materials in construction?","[""abstract""]"

This is because a key model input–namely the valuation of centennial climate damage–is highly unknowable for fundamental reasons discussed here. Problems with damage valuation are highlighted by the implicit implausibility to climate scientists of a leading model's (centennial) damage function, and by strong criticisms of damage functions by many climate economists. The claim that statistical analyses of past weather impacts on local economies, combined with structural modeling of sectoral impacts, can significantly improve centennial damage valuation rests on untestable, far‐out‐of‐sample extrapolation. Testing centennial climate (natural) science projections is generally harder than testing predictions in astronomy, geology and other earth sciences, because of Earth's uniqueness, and the unprecedented degree of likely climate change; but stable underlying laws make climate modeling based on past observations meaningful. By contrast, the added complexity of human behavior means there are no quantitatively stable laws for modeling the value of centennial climate damage. I suggest that any carbon prices used to inform climate policies, be they carbon prices used as policy instruments, or complementary, non‐carbon‐price policies, should instead be based on marginal abatement costs, found by modeling low‐cost pathways to socially agreed, physical climate targets. A pathway approach to estimating carbon prices poses challenges to many economists, and is no panacea, but it avoids any illusion of optimality, and facilitates detailed analysis of sectoral policies.","[""abstract""]"

Net present value (NPV) was used to represent financial attractiveness. It was assumed that stands would not be harvested at volumes less than 80 m3·ha−1. A baseline case with the stumpage price set to $20 m−3, stand establishment cost $500 ha−1, and the discount rate 4%, was used with wide-ranging sensitivity analyses conducted around these assumptions. These values represent the wide range of choices and outcomes possible with black spruce regeneration investments.

A carbon price for build-up of carbon storage and for emissions from harvested forest products was introduced to achieve an economic value for carbon sequestration. Forest development was simulated using an optimizing stand-level planning model, and the solution for the whole region was found using linear programming. A range of carbon prices was used to study the effect on harvest levels and carbon sequestration. At a zero carbon price, the mean annual harvest level was 5.4 million m3, the mean annual carbon sequestration in forest biomass was 1.48 million tonnes and the mean annual replacement of carbon from fossil fuel with forest biofuel was 61 000 tonnes. Increasing the carbon price led to decreasing harvest levels of timber and decreasing harvest levels of forest biofuel. Also, thinning activities decreased more than clear-cut activities when the carbon prices increased. The level of carbon sequestration was governed by the harvest level and the site productivity.

The need to address both concerns has generated a renewed interest in the use of sectoral approaches. This article proposes a new sectoral framework approach using the case of the cement industry, within which equity and efficiency requirements are addressed. The proposed approach combines basic components put forward by industry, such as the use of absolute caps for industrialized countries and intensity targets for emerging countries, the introduction of a border carbon adjustment (BCA) on imports from those countries that do not adopt the sectoral approach, and the use of financial transfers collected through CO2 revenues in industrialized countries.

While the paper could be centered on a more formal model, here the tone of the discussion resembles more that of an exploratory think piece directed to policymakers and the general public.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Our focus is on firmlevel trading systems, although much of what we say would also apply to government-level trading (e.g., AAU trading under the Kyoto Protocol). We examine the “first principles” of design to maximise flexibility and to minimise costs, consider temporal design including banking and borrowing and other mechanisms to provide greater carbon price predictability and credibility over time, and consider spatial elements, examining the key design issues in linking national and regional carbon markets together to create a global carbon market.

On the one hand, climate science has become ever more compelling. Yet at the international negotiations, under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), countries have failed to make the commitments necessary to achieve their stated objective of keeping the rise in global temperatures below 2°C above pre-industrial levels? Why is it that their best efforts to date are likely to result in a warming trajectory of 3.2°C? What is clear is that in many jurisdictions the debate on climate change is parochial and impoverished by the vested interests of the fossil fuel industry which has campaigned so relentlessly against climate regulation. Add to this politicians, who lack either the knowledge, or the courage, to lead a ‘reasoned discussion’ on the issue. Citizens in relatively wealthy economies are encouraged to think only about the financial impost of carbon prices on themselves and their families, as politicians chase the goal of winning government in short-term election cycles. Seldom is the current consensus on climate science, or the predicted climate change disasters, clearly articulated and communicated. The author will rely on the work of two philosophers to craft a global justice vision for climate law in this time of ‘unreason’. The works are Amartya Sen’s The Idea of Justice and Stephen Gardiner’s A Perfect Moral Storm: Climate Change, Intergenerational Ethics and the Problem of Moral Corruption. Sen encourages us, when considering questions of justice, to broaden the informational basis of our evaluations, free from vested interests. Meanwhile, Gardiner says we need to think clearly and to protect ourselves against weak or deceptive arguments that permit us to ‘pass the climate change buck’ to the next generation. In developing this thesis, the author will of necessity refer to a contrary view offered by Posner and Weisbach in Climate Change Justice where the authors allow national, or local, preferences to dictate the parameters of a climate change treaty. The author will reject the thesis proposed by these authors.","[""abstract""]"

Consequently, it matters to understand both drivers for and barriers to innovation in the stationary energy sector which accounts for 50% of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. This report: • Articulates a theoretical framework for the assessment of relevant innovation systems, to assist in the identification of innovation barriers, market failures and gaps, relating to research, development, deployment and commercialisation of new low carbon energy technologies and processes. • Analyses key factors relating to investment decisions in energy sectors. • Provides broad principles for energy technology innovation policy, and outlines how these might be applied in the Australian context. Our review of innovation systems theory supports the finding of the Stern Review that, in addition to putting a market price on carbon emissions, complementary measures are needed to promote low carbon innovation directly. This report focuses on the rationale and potential measures in an Australian context. Section 1 synthesises current theories of innovation systems and processes. These theories emphasise: the systemic interactions and feedbacks between a range of 'actors', including firms, entrepreneurs, consumers, policy makers and regulatory agencies; the importance of learning processes and the future expectations of these actors, operating in an environment of risks and uncertainties; and the role of the institutional framework of rules, incentives and 'routines' in influencing their expectations and current behaviour. These theories highlight the role of positive feedbacks to the adoption of technologies and associated rule-systems. Section 2 argues that feedbacks of this kind have led to a current state of 'carbon lock-in', creating barriers to the innovation and deployment of low carbon technologies. Current fossil fuel based systems have been successful in meeting consumer demands for energy, transport and heat services at relatively low private costs, but to the neglect of some potentially serious environmental and social costs. This report argues that, in order to overcome this state of carbon lock-in, direct support for innovation at two levels is needed to complement measures to put a price on carbon emissions. Carbon pricing will be crucial for the achievement of a low carbon economy, but it is best suited for mature low carbon technologies and needs to be complemented by measures to promote innovation and commercialisation of low carbon technologies currently at earlier stages of development.

Furthermore, failure to reinvigorate the ETS might compromise the cost-effective synchronisation of European decarbonisation efforts across sectors and countries. To restore credibility and to ensure long-term commitment to the ETS, the European Investment Bank should auction guarantees on the future emission allowance price. This will reduce the risk for low-carbon investments and enable stabilisation of the ETS until a compromise is found on structural measures to reinforce it in order to achieve the EU's long-term decarbonisation targets. Evolution of the EU carbon price since 2008 THE ISSUE The European Union's emissions trading system (ETS), introduced in 2005, is the centerpiece of EU decarbonisation efforts and the biggest emissions trading scheme in the world. After a peak in May 2008, the price of ETS carbon allowances started to collapse, and industry, civil society and policymakers began to think about how to ‘repair the ETS’. However, the ETS is an effective and efficient tool to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, and although prices have not been stable, it has evolved to cover more sectors and greenhouse gases, and to become more robust and less distorting. Prices are depressed because of an interplay of fundamental factors and a lack of confidence in the system.","[""abstract""]"

Economic aspects of inclusion of the aviation sector in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme Briefing Note","2006","0","The opinions expressed in this document do not necessarily represent the official position of the European Parliament. Reproduction and translation for non-commercial purposes are authorised provided the source is acknowledged and the publisher is given prior notice and receives a copy. 1. As a result of the recent and projected future increase in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the aviation sector, action to design a framework incentivizing industry to reduce these emissions should be a political priority. 2. According to recent studies, inclusion of aviation in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) by 2012, with an initial allocation based on 2008 emission levels, is unlikely to affect substantially the demand for credits in the ETS, or the carbon price. 3. Design options significantly affect the cost to the aviation industry of the measures, notably grandfathering versus auctioning. Intra-sector competitiveness impacts are likely to be more pronounced than concerns about effects on other sectors. 4. The requirements of the Emissions Trading Directive have required a steep learning curve for current sectors, which will be even more true for aviation, which has less experience with similar regulation. Sufficient thought would have to be given to the technical underpinnings of the system to facilitate integration. 5. If there current moment toward implementing an emissions trading system for aviation in the first Kyoto period 2008-2012 is insufficient to lead to agreement to do so, it could be more realistic to consider a post-2012 system. However, were this to be the case, then much of the work done to date predicting the economic impacts is likely to be irrelevant: far from being a minor addition to the system with little effect on price, aviation could be a major inclusion, given emissions growth rates. 6. If the introduction of a system for aviation happens late in the 2008-12 period, or later, incentives may be created for airlines to put off fleet renewal or efficiency improvements until after the introduction of the system. Interim measures need to be taken to avoid this downward spiral.","[""abstract""]"

The Australian financialization model, introduced by the previous Australian (Australian Labor Party) government, is planned to be repealed in mid-2014 (depending on votes in the upper house of the Australian parliament) by the conservative (Liberal-National Party coalition) government as its ‘first order of business’. At the time of writing in April 2014, the carbon price is in full operation. The government won office in September 2013, partly in the wake of an electoral backlash against the ‘carbon tax’. Australia's climate change model was based on defining emission reduction units as financial products under the Corporations Act, which resulted in the regulation of the market for trading emissions reductions becoming the responsibility of the financial services regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. This article examines the financial services model which treats emissions as financial products, regulated by financial services laws which provide inter alia for trading on regulated markets, the licensing of advisers, the expectation of high standards for secondary trading, the recognition of consumer rights under consumer laws and the continuous disclosure of information to financial markets.","[""abstract""]"

In a business as usual scenario the optimal path is to use first only oil, before using the two resources and relying a lot on cheaper coal, until the backstop becomes profitable.

Certaines flexibilites y sont instaurees dans un objectif d’efficacite economique. Un marche des quotas interetatique, concernant les parties de l’annexe I est en effet cree ainsi deux autres mecanismes de flexibilite dont le Mecanisme de Developpement Propre (MDP). Celui-ci permet aux pays industrialises soumis a une contrainte de reduction d’acheter des credits carbone avec des projets issus des pays non-annexe I. Le MDP connait un relatif succes quantitatif jusqu’en 2012 : 7703 projets enregistres, 9.5 a 13 milliards de dollars transferes Nord-Sud (CCNUCC) via l’achat de credits carbone, 1 656 millions de tonnes de CO2-equivalent (TCO2e) auraient ete reduites entre 2004 et avril 2016 (UNEP-Risoe). C’est un outil pourtant a l’arret depuis 2012 du fait d’un marche sans demande depuis 2012. Cette situation est due a des raisons institutionnelles (retrait du soutien de l’UE) lie aux controverses remettant en cause l’integrite environnementale du MDP. (cf. Haya 2007, Wara et Victor 2009, L.Schneider 2011). LE MDP illustre bien comment une architecture institutionnelle polycentrique et multiniveaux ouvre des voies de communication et d’echange, y compris marchand, dont les Acteurs Non-Etatique se saisissent pour exprimer leurs interets aupres des centres de decisions politiques et technico-operationnels controlant le MDP. Malgre ou du fait de ces interactions, le MDP a ete un dispositif institutionnel peu robuste face aux controverses. En effet, le MDP a ete soumis a une forte tension entre logique financiere et integrite environnementale aboutissant a la decision de l’UE de 2009 de ne plus soutenir le MDP et la demande du marche. Nous avons souhaite comprendre comment les caracteristiques de l’architecture institutionnelle du MDP, polycentre et multiniveau, et leurs saisies par les acteurs ont-elles contribues ou non a son manque de robustesse ? Le questionnement s’integre dans deux courant de reflexions : il s’inscrit d’abord dans la litterature etudiant le role de la flexibilite des regimes polycentriques dans la robustesse des dispositifs institutionnels de gestion des biens communs partages (Ostrom 1990, 2005, 2010, Andeeries, Janssen et Ostrom 2010) et celles des complexes de regime (Keohane et Victor 2010). Il nous permet ensuite d’illustrer les liens entre marches et dispositifs institutionnels legitimant ainsi l’approche neo-institutionnaliste economique, reintroduisant l’importance de l’encastrement des marches dans les structures sociales et institutionnelles. (Polanyi 1945, North 1990, 2005, Ostrom 1990, 2005). Nous decrivons d’abord en quoi le MDP est un dispositif polycentrique et multi-niveau et comment les acteurs s’en saisissent. Nous illustrons notre propos dans un deuxieme temps avec l’etude d’une controverse, celle des projets industriels, qui ont atteint l’integrite environnementale du MDP. Nous questionnerons enfin les fragilites que l’architecture polycentrique et multi-niveau semblent avoir apporte au dispositif pour nous rendre compte que c’est probablement son caractere « incomplet » qui a ete source de fragilisation. Notre travail s’appuie sur une demarche essentiellement qualitative : etude de documents, de rapports, ainsi que sur nos observations du fonctionnement du MDP. Une part quantitative vient cependant appuyer la description du MDP via l’analyse des reseaux sociaux.

We incorporate both knowledge spillovers and imperfections in the demand for energy efficiency. We conclude that some technology policies, particularly correcting R&D market failures, can be useful complements to emissions pricing, but ambitious renewable targets or subsidies seem unlikely to enhance welfare when placed alongside sufficient emissions pricing. The desirability of stringent EE policies is highly sensitive to the degree of undervaluation of EE by consumers, which also has implications for policies that tend to lower electricity prices.

To ensure a level playing field, these two approaches are initially calibrated to be welfare-equivalent for the country in a deterministic setting. While both price and quantity instruments have identical consequences under perfect certainty, outcomes differ substantially when uncertainty is introduced. The uncertainty analyzed here takes the reduced form of idiosyncratic country-specific abatement-cost shocks. Then, because of cross-border revenue flows, internationally-tradable permits can expose a country to greater risk than the imposition of a uniform carbon price (whose revenue proceeds are domestically retained). This result is formalized in a very simple model that highlights the core essence of the argument. Some implications are discussed. I suggest that this relative-riskiness result may be a pertinent consideration in choosing between negotiated price-based approaches and negotiated quantity-based approaches for controlling worldwide carbon emissions.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Chapter 5 zeroes in on 2006–2007 with respect to business’—and especially energy industry’s—realization that they needed as much certainty as possible in long-term investments and therefore would be more amenable to a predictable even if somewhat costly emissions framework. Chapter 6 assesses direct and indirect advantages to certain industries, including forestry and railways, respectively, from a national carbon-pricing policy. Chapter 7 emphasizes the experience and, more precisely, the familiarity of an industry with a policy instrument. Chapter 8 finds that key managers’ ideas are less influential on industry stances toward climatemitigation policy options than previously hypothesized. Specifically, the author did not find corroborating evidence for anecdotal claims about individuals’ own preferences guiding the process of arriving at industry positions. However, assessments of short-term versus long-term risks figured prominently in managers’ personal as well as their companies’ official stances. The author notes that experience plays a large part in these stances and suggests five patterns of professional experience that may be predictors of policy conclusions. For example, a “firm [which] had previous experience with a carbon-pricing instrument ... but would gain no apparent advantage from either cap-and-trade or carbon tax” will stay with what they already know. Patterns are interesting in that can be seen to depersonalize decisions; that is, patterns happen. In that sense it’s like machine learning, an observation of what is, without questioning if it should be. The book’s moral neutrality is admirable. It maintains its focus on communication and decision-making rather than moral theory. Still, industry managers are moral agents as well as agents on behalf of shareholders, and this use case could be mined from the point of view of agency. Munroe’s suggestion that “further study is needed to determine how firms’ [managers’] decisions on addressing the climate change issue are made” acknowledges that this is beyond the scope of this book, and understandably so. Still, such “further study” would necessarily bring the moral dimension into the light. The interaction between personal beliefs and professional policy conclusions ultimately is a moral one for the manager/agent. Munroe’s analysis concludes in chapter 9 with a stress on the complexity of industry motivations and positions with respect to environmental policy in general and climate policy in particular. Ultimately, the book ably demonstrates how perceptions and calculated assessments of cost, risk, relationships, and the future contribute to industry positions. The author calls for similar studies in other countries as well as further investigation of the roles of investor and other stakeholding groups’ roles. Business in a Changing Climate offers a careful and penetrating look inside business engagement with climate change. It is a fine example of scholarship that is highly readable, relevant, and concisely presented. One imagines that the content gathered from her 60 interview subjects and her many cited references this book could have been treated in many more pages, but it is hard to imagine that more words would improve an already excellent volume.

First, the ""average cost effect"", due to the carbon price, causes a decrease in the input capacity with respect to a reference case where the permits market does not exist. Second, the ""marginal variability effect"" or the impact of price variability, which instead leads to an expansion of the installed equipment. Third, the ""technology effect"", i.e. the extent of substitution between polluting and clean inputs. Model simulations show that this interaction can result in weak emission reductions.","[""abstract""]"

Two of the chapters focus on topics in environmental economics and the third on U.S. household finance. All of the papers analyze the incentives and behavior of individuals (or firms in the case of the first chapter) to provide insight into macro phenomena. The Effects of Carbon Markets on Equity Prices and Volatility uses a firm-level dataset of carbon assets and liabilities between 2005 and 2007 to examine the impact of volatile carbon prices on equity prices. I find that the changes to firms' market capitalizations during a period of falling carbon prices are explained by the change in the net present value of emission permit holdings. Equity prices respond to changes in the mark-to-market value of firms' carbon permit shortfalls or surpluses and carbon price volatility increases the volatility of equity prices. I also document considerable delays in the equity and options markets responses to developments in carbon markets and attribute these lagged responses to information constraints and the novelty of carbon markets. Outstanding Debt and the Household Portfolio, co-written with my classmate Reza Shabani, alters a simple portfolio choice model to allow households to retire outstanding debt and realize a risk-free rate of return equal to the interest rate on that debt. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances we find that households with mortgage debt are 10 percent less likely to own stocks and 37 percent less likely to own bonds compared to similar households with no outstanding mortgage debt. To show that our results are not driven by irrational behavior amongst a subset of households, we construct two proxy variables for financial naivete. Finally we calculate the costs of non-optimal investment decisions in the presence of various forms of household debt including mortgages, home equity loans and credit card debt. We find that 26 percent of households should forego equity market participation on account of the high interest rates that they pay on their debt. Crude Drilling: An Analysis of Incentives and Behavior in the Oil Industry During the 1860s explains why rates of oil extraction in the nascent oil industry far exceeded the profit maximizing levels predicted by the economic theory of non-renewable resources. The analysis combines historical narrative accounts with property sale and lease data and information on oil well owners to explain how individual incentives led to aggregate over-drilling. In particular, I focus on the incentives of under-capitalized wildcat drillers as an explanation for the excessive waste and under-investment that characterized the early oil market. I find that these poorer prospectors were incentivized to extract oil at higher than optimal rates because of the characteristics of their property lease contracts and the low-cost drilling technology they used to bore exploratory wells. Low barriers to entry in the early oil drilling business led to an influx of wildcat drillers into the nascent oil market and delayed the entry of additional well-capitalized drillers. The result was a market characterized by cyclical supply shocks, low levels of investment in storage and conservation, and corresponding price instability.","[""abstract""]"

Specifically, rather than setting limits on the emissions produced in each country, the agreement should set limits on the emissions embedded in what is consumed in each country. As under the Kyoto Protocol, the limits could be enforced in each participating country with measures of their own choosing. A carbon pricing scheme, such as a carbon tax or emissions trading, applicable only to domestic consumption would be the obvious choice. The carbon price would, however, need to cover all domestic consumption, whether the product was produced domestically or imported. So as with today’s value-added taxes, it would need to be charged on imported products, and refunded on exported products. This change would greatly alter the economic incentives facing the participating countries and their economies. It would also help to clarify some basic issues of fairness for developing countries that are not easily dealt with under the conventional approach. The overall effect of the change would be to make it much easier to reach a strong climate change agreement that would be acceptable to both developing and developed countries, and that would be politically easier to implement and enforce in each participating country once it was adopted.","[""abstract""]"

In 1990 Finland was the first country to introduce a tax on CO2. Later, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands, Slovenia, Germany and the UK followed suit with tax reforms that shifted taxation from labour to carbon and energy. Over the years, CO2 and energy taxes have gradually been raised, so that in Europe taxes of more than 25 billion Euros a year have been shifted. This book examines carbon-energy taxation in detail and looks at tax shifting programmes for lowering other taxes. It offers extensive analysis on the basis of historical data and seeks to answer important questions for policy-making, such as: What was the impact of tax shifting for economic performance and competitiveness? By how much were emissions of CO2 reduced? Could energy-intensive industries cut further down on their fuel demand or did they loose market shares? To what extent was there 'leakage' from Europe, so that production and CO2 emissions were shifted to other countries or regions without CO2-abatement policy? The use of unique and original data, including sector-specific energy prices and taxes, as well as the use of advanced statistical techniques, such as co-integration analysis and panel-regression techniques along with the time-series estimated macro-economic model E3ME, make this a truly comprehensive volume. On the basis of the lessons learned in Europe, this volume indicates how carbon-energy taxation could usefully be combined with emissions trading, and discusses implications for future international climate policy, including how the IPCC recommendations for a gradual escalation in carbon price could be accomplished while preventing carbon leakage.

Businesses and consumers are subject to tax-imposed costs that affect decisions about activities and investments. In some cases, Congress shifts costs by lessening the tax burden on one activity or another. These cost shifts also influence investment decisions. Congress can also influence decisions by direct action: by regulating activities or by directly funding activities through appropriations. In many cases, the tax system’s incentives are not consistent with the government’s stated goals. In fact, the tax system itself creates contradictory incentives. For example, the tax system creates incentives for using energy as well as for conserving energy. While this result may seem perverse, it should not be unexpected. This Article will address both direct and indirect connections between tax policy and carbon emissions. Any discussion of tax policy’s impact on the environment must begin with a review of how the Code can be used to encourage behavior. Accordingly, this Article will begin with a brief discussion of tax expenditures. The Article will then review tax policy recommendations in the following areas: (1) housing; (2) transportation; (3) energy and conservation incentives; and (4) carbon pricing, including carbon sequestration. For each area, I will compare past recommendations to actual changes in tax policy and make predictions about coming changes to tax policy and how it may affect carbon emissions.","[""abstract""]"

There is strong confidence that China will proceed to introduce national emissions trading, probably in conjunction with a carbon tax. Carbon price levels are expected to rise, in time exceeding those currently prevailing in the EU emissions trading scheme. A large majority of respondents expect that China's 2020 emissions intensity target will be achieved or surpassed, and almost all expect further targets to be adopted in 2025 and 2030, possibly in the form of absolute limits on emissions.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Europe specialises more than its main global competitors in industries with relatively high carbon emissions, such as minerals and chemicals, rather than in high-tech industries and services . This would have a real effect on Europe’s competitiveness in a world regulated by carbon pricing schemes such as the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme – even if other blocs apply them as the EU does. Furthermore, in the absence of fair and undistorting carbon pricing schemes worldwide, there is a real risk that business will resort to regulatory arbitrage which will entail a shift in where emissions take place – but no reduction in global emissions. In any case, the issue of which economies are ‘carbon competitive’ will gradually become a much bigger part of the global trade conversation.","[""abstract""]"

The first topic proposes an intrabasin allocate-and-trade, institution, to manage the eastern Nile River basin with the objective of increasing the overall basin's welfare through improving efficiency, equity and sustainability. By developing the Nile Environmental and Economic Optimization Model (NEEOM), we estimate the current, planned and improved welfare value. We find that a water trade institution can achieve nearly 100% of the welfare created by economically efficient allocation, and secure equivalent volumes of water compared with the status quo scheme. We estimate that riparian countries could raise about $660 million per annum for protecting and conserving the natural resources of the basin. Finally, using Global Circulation Models, we find that the institution will recover nearly all of the efficient outcomes. The second topic is designed to study the behavior of carbon price volatility before, within and after the 2008/09 global recession using Markov Regime Switching model. The results show that an unregulated voluntary carbon market was in high-volatile regime within, and two years before, the recession. A regulated compliance carbon market was relatively in stable and low-volatile regime for these periods, except at the end of the recession. It can be inferred that high-volatile regimes were, however, not caused by the recession per se. The Wald tests show that there were distinct low-and high-volatile regimes during the recession period, indicating that the recession aggravated the volatility of both voluntary and compliance markets.The third topic is designed to study the relationship between economic growth and pollution using nonparametric econometric technique. The results indicate a partial relationship between GDP per capita and the level of PM10 pollution for low- and high-income countries. Hence, environmental policies for reducing the level of PM10 pollution have to emphasize middle-income and oil-producing high-income countries that show unprecedented increase in the level of PM10 pollution. Further, the Li and Wang test indicates that nonparametric analysis turns out to produce better results than quadratic and cubic specifications. Semiparametric models show decreasing pollution level as income rises and improve the smoothness of the relationship.","[""abstract""]"

As carbon cap-and-trade makes its way across the pond to the U.S., regulators have much to learn from the mistakes of the European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). However, it isn’t Europe’s implementation flaws that have caused precariousness in carbon prices as much as it is the political nature of the financial product itself.

However, by allowing for a fragmented approach to mobilizing funds, current multilateral commitments raise further legitimacy challenges. We analyze the potential for unilateral and coordinated approaches to advance output and input legitimacy respectively by raising adequate funds and representing interests in contributing and recipient countries that are affected by funding decisions. Achieving legitimacy will require coordinated approaches to goal-setting, oversight and effort-sharing. Vesting contributing countries with substantial discretion over funding sources may enhance taxpayers' support and boost funding more rapidly. However, multilateral coordination will be necessary to maximize opportunities for raising revenue from carbon pricing and to minimize adverse impacts of funding choices on developing countries. Our analysis provides a principled justification for the degree of fragmentation compatible with achieving legitimacy. These insights may inform future evaluation of legitimacy requirements in other spheres of environmental governance.","[""abstract""]"

This paper reviews sub-federal policy development among American states and Canadian provinces, a great many of whom have been active in climate policy development. With one notable exception, it concludes that explicit carbon taxation appears to remain a political non-starter. At the same time, states and provinces have been placing indirect carbon prices on fossil fuel use through a wide range of policies over the past fifteen years. These tend to strategically alter labeling, finding different ways to characterize new or expanded policies by avoiding the terms of ""tax"" and ""carbon"" in imposing costs.

But depending on the allocation of tax revenues and initial pollution permits, the instruments have very different wealth implications for the individual countries. The paper highlights the distributional effects of climate policies by calculating and comparing emission budget allocations under three different schemes that are in line with a 2◦C warming target. We calculate implicit carbon budgets up to 2050 under a globally uniform CO2 price, a design proposed by Weitzman (2014). We then compare the allocation with the budget derived from equity principles by Bretschger (2013) and with emission budgets under egalitarian emission rights as proposed by BASIC (2011). Our results show that implicit burden sharing across countries varies substantially with the different policy regimes. Wealthy countries with low energy prices tend to obtain the highest emission budget under a price scheme while poor low-emission countries receive the highest budget under egalitarian emission rights. The budget positions of India and the US are illustrative for the conflicting country interests.","[""abstract""]"

Given the timing and the framing of the conference, this is perhaps not surprising. However, understanding how expectations were raised so high and why negotiators failed to meet them is vital to planning the next steps toward meaningful climate action. In the lead-up to Copenhagen, the policy options available became framed almost exclusively in terms of a classic zero-sum game, creating absolute winners and losers. Negotiators became bogged down in developing complex formulas to share the climate ""burden,"" while attempting to preserve states' rights to sovereign domestic policies. Given the economic and geopolitical upheavals of recent years-and that the 192 nations present all held widely disparate interpretations of equity-this effort turned out to be impossible. The talks would have been more productive if, rather than focusing solely on the short-term costs of carbon reduction policies, they had focused on the massive economic opportunities presented by a move to a low-carbon economy. The advantages of this transformation have not yet been sufficiently understood or accepted, despite compelling evidence that a highly-efficient, low-carbon industrial development path can yield economic growth and greater energy security. Technological advances, ""green jobs,"" and reduced healthcare spending as a result of decreased pollution all represent potential economic opportunities. In 2009, more venture capital went into green technology start-ups than into any other sector. Wind, solar, and other renewable sources of energy are coming online in massive volumes. Projects such as the UK off-shore wind farms, the Indian solar project, and massive wind deployments in China and Africa are changing the energy mix and showing that renewables can make significant in-roads across the world. In the United States, cities and states are making major investments in energy-efficient, low-carbon transport systems. But these facts were not reflected at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conference. Political leaders at Copenhagen were more focused on the threat of job losses today, rather than opportunities and the promise of job creation tomorrow. Brazil, South Africa, India, and China, for example, all made it very clear that the notions of ""targets, caps, and limits"" must, at least in the short term, take a back seat. Meanwhile, even small countries, such as Sudan, Venezuela, Saudi Arabia, Bolivia, and Cuba, demonstrated their ability to act as ""spoilers"" and prevent any progress simply by refusing to accept any proposal put forward. As a result, the focus has shifted from ""global climate action"" toward an alternative, decentralized model that stresses the overall quality of economic growth, including international competitiveness, energy security, jobs, national security, and health. Similarly, the notion of a global carbon price has been replaced by a decentralized model that relies on a portfolio of domestic policies. The future of the UNFCCC administered multi-lateral process is highly uncertain at this time. The dual-tracked negotiations will continue, at least until this year's December meeting in Cancun. However, it is unclear whether these negotiations will produce a negotiation text, much less a binding treaty. At the same time, the Copenhagen Accord called for informal ""panels"" to advance the negotiations on REDD+ (Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) and climate finance. At the time of writing, the mandate, participants, and process for these panels remain unclear, as is the process by which their findings will be integrated into the UNFCCC process. The post-Copenhagen context has been further complicated by a concerted attempt by those who have a vested interest in the high-carbon economy to undermine climate science with misleading attacks on the credibility of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the scientific community at large. …","[""abstract""]"

After describing the risks of cap-and-trade with carbon offsets and the advantages of a harmonized carbon tax, a method is proposed to utilize a globally harmonized carbon price to finance the Green Climate Fund. A common minimum carbon price is set across all nations, which can choose either a carbon tax or an emissions trading price floor, with any carbon offsets applying only above the price floor. The harmonized minimum carbon price is incrementally increased until 2050 to reach the cost of atmospheric removal and achieve a sustainable equilibrium. This method does not explicitly require setting otherwise uncertain global emissions caps, but total global emissions can be regulated nevertheless, by monitoring emissions and adjusting the minimum carbon price trajectory. Carbon revenues collected internally within nations are used for internal investments in climate change, with a globally determined minimum percentage applied towards mitigation. Financing for the Green Climate Fund is generated from transferring a percentage of the collected revenues, based on national wealth and a sliding window of historical responsibility for fossil fuel emissions. Collected revenue is disbursed for climate funding based on a set of national climate need factors for adaptation and mitigation, including preserving strategic carbon absorbers, low-carbon infrastructure, technology transfer and family planning. In the interest of distributive fairness, nations themselves determine the need factors of each other. Formulas are presented for collection and disbursement, which require parameters for a globally harmonized carbon price, a climate fund contribution rate, historical responsibility from fossil fuel emissions, relative national wealth factors with thresholds for fund contributors and recipients, and need factors for each nation. Published economic and emissions data are used with the formulas to demonstrate an example of how the financing can work. This presents an equitable way to address climate finance across all nations on both a global and regional level.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

With these private benefits from deforestation come external costs: emissions from deforestation currently account for 12 per cent of global carbon emissions. A widespread intervention in reducing emissions from deforestation will affect the paths of agricultural expansion and economic growth of lower income nations. To investigate these processes, this paper presents a general, dynamic, stochastic model of deforestation and economic growth. The model is shown to generate unique deforestation and investment paths and a model without reduced deforestation policy is shown to have a stationary distribution of income and landholdings. There are three main findings. First, in the short run national output growth falls with compensation for reduced deforestation. Second, deforestation rates are reduced through compensating either reduced deforestation directly or the stock of forests; however, compensating the stock of forests is likely to be prohibitively expensive. Finally, by offering a fixed compensation rate, as opposed to a compensation rate tied to a stochastic carbon price, further reductions in deforestation can be achieved.","[""abstract""]"

It would be desirable to have legislation that would put Ireland on a low-cost and equitable trajectory to a zero-carbon economy. The draft Climate Change Response Bill 2010 will not achieve that. The exact emission reduction targets for 2020 are ambiguous, but considerably more ambitious than Ireland's obligations under EU legislation. EU legislation severely constrains the options for domestic climate policy so that the extra emission reduction would fall almost exclusively on agriculture, households, small and medium enterprises, and transport. The target in the draft bill for 2020 would require draconian policies. It would be better to keep the EU targets for 2020. The targets for 2030 and 2050 would require a further sharpening of climate policy. It would be better to base climate policy on predictably rising carbon prices. The draft bill fails to create a framework that would ensure that policy interventions are effective, as cheap as possible, and fair. Current policy meets none of these criteria. The Regulatory Impact Analysis is a collection of qualitative assertions that shed little light on the impact of the draft bill.

A system of ‘border tax adjustment’ on imports is suggested in order to countervail the cost of domestic emission trading systems. The proponents argue that without such measures, a country having adopted an emission trading system would not only lose economically but also environmentally. The standard reason given to justify this argument is the notion of carbon leakage, namely, the danger that energy-intensive production would move from countries with domestic policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions based on a carbon price for emitters to regions that do not have a binding and costly regulatory CO2 regime. Recently, the discussions have been fuelled by the Waxman/Markey Bill, adopted on 26 June 2009 by the House of Representatives and by a French non-paper, presented at the informal EU Environment Council held in July 2009. These two initiatives aim to establish, in the context of a domestic emission trading system, a system of ‘border tax adjustment’ against some imports from some countries, namely, those that are seen as not contributing enough in the fight against climate change. The revised European ETS Directive does not provide for border measures. It instructs the European Commission to submit a report to the Council and the European Parliament no later than 30 June 2010 assessing whether energy-intensive sectors are exposed to a significant risk of carbon leakage and explicitly outlines the inclusion of imports in the European Union’s ETS system as one of several actions. The joint WTO-UNEP paper on trade and climate change has been widely regarded as a justification from a legal point of view of such measures. While there are many proponents for such measures, there remains a considerable amount of skepticism; politicians, business organizations, and scholars have warned against such an approach. The following short note will discuss the feasibility of ‘border tax adjustment’ in relation to domestic climate change legislation as well as some WTO legal aspects along the following questions: (1) Are there target countries for border measures? (2) Would border measures help to combat climate change and could they be administered without too much bureaucracy? (3) How should border measures be qualified under General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)?","[""abstract""]"

In a period of constrained public finances, if governments want to leverage the necessary private innovation for clean-energy technologies, they will have to provide well-designed time-consistent policies, reducing commercial and financial risk through a combination of consistent carbon pricing, regulations and public funding, which will have to give a sizable and consistent push to early-stage clean-energy technologies, with a clear exit strategy. 
 
But first and foremost, governments should establish a sufficiently high and long-term predictable carbon price. The design of the EU emissions trading system and the distribution of carbon allowances should take into account more explicitly its power to leverage innovation. A move to a 30 percent EU emissions reduction target, which would involve a tighter emissions cap and fewer allowances being auctioned, would result would result in a higher carbon price and provide greater incentives for innovation.","[""abstract""]"

Carbon prices were indirectly generated by the massive use of export VAT refund rebate and export tax on energy-intensive products since 2007. It will be explicitly complemented by an emission trading scheme (ETS) tested at provincial level by 2013 and implemented at national level by 2015. While one could expect such initiatives to grant China a status as a “climate-champion”, doubts have been cast on the rationale for taxing energy-intensive exports on the one hand, and the value given to CO2 either at the border or domestically on the other. By using both quantitative and qualitative assessments, the thesis contributes to unpacking China’s domestic and border carbon pricing policies by analyzing their incentives and domestic and global consequences. It proposes first to accelerate domestic carbon price stringency; and second to implement an explicit and comparable (20$/tCO2) export carbon price, particularly on energy-intensive products, as a short-term transitional measure before a domestic comparable carbon price is introduced.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Public co-ordination with long term arrangements needs to be introduced as a substitute to long term co-ordination by the market. Indeed, the current market co-ordination makes carbon prices ineffective at orienting investors towards low carbon technologies : fossil fuel generation technologies are preferred because their investment risks are much lower in the market regime. So, in order to avoid delayed investment aiming at the decarbonisation of electricity systems, a number of new market arrangements which lower the investment risk of these technologies are being selected by governments. But, as these low carbon equipments develop, long term co-ordination by the market for the other technologies (peaking units, CCGT) will fade away. That means that in the future, public co-ordination and planning will completely replace market players' decisions, not only for low carbon technologies, but for every capacity development.","[""abstract""]"

He says that restricting airport capacity on environmental grounds could have a negative impact on the economy but endorses the idea that travellers should pay the full environmental cost of their journeys. He notes the Government's 2003 Air Transport White Paper forecast that aviation demand would more than double between 2004 and 2030 even with the introduction of carbon pricing. The economic benefits of expanding regional airports were less clear than those of expanding international airports.

First, the multiplicity of preferences among Australian veto players, coupled a partisan climate politics, has made climate policy inherently unstable. In the EU, on the other hand, a less divisive climate politics set the stage for an inter-temporally stable climate policy. These led to a divergence in interest groups’ feedback to the introduction of the respective climate policies. While Australian partisan climate politics incentivised businesses to fight back, a less partisan politics in the EU sent a unified message for businesses to adapt. Finally, Australia’s climate policy lacked effective adhesion and flexibility mechanisms to prosper in an uncertain political future.","[""abstract""]"
"152889994","null","1271845084","The WTO Consistency of Carbon Footprint Taxes","2015","3","Absent meaningful multilateral action on greenhouse gas emissions, countries wishing to combat climate change must decide whether to take or continue unilateral action. A significant obstacle facing many governments is how to maintain the competitiveness of domestic industries and minimize the leakage of carbon emissions through international trade without violating trade rules. One way to assuage these competitiveness and leakage concerns is to implement destination-based carbon pricing—carbon policy levied at the point of consumption, rather than production. This Article addresses whether one such form of climate policy—a consumption tax levied on the carbon footprint of goods consumed domestically—would be consistent with World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Because a carbon footprint tax (CFT) would be levied at the point of consumption, goods would be treated equally regardless of whether they are imported or produced domestically. This Article analyzes the legal precedents for a footprint tax and identifies grounds upon which a CFT might possibly be challenged. Our assessment is that the most convincing challenge would be through the likeness criterion. Although the CFT would be a single-rate tax, the effective tax per-unit will vary across goods according to their carbon footprint. As a result, goods that are identical but for differences in their embodied emissions will face different tax burdens; if goods with different embodied carbon are deemed like goods, any variation in the per-unit tax could be interpreted as violating National Treatment. Recent precedents for treating goods as distinct because of consumer tastes and production externalities suggest that highand low-carbon goods may not be deemed like in the event of a challenge. Nevertheless, we also outline an alternate policy—one which pairs a uniform tax on goods with a consumption subsidy for low-carbon goods—that may survive challenge * Carol McAusland is an Associate Professor in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems at the University of British Columbia, and the Canada Research Chair in Trade and Environment. © 2015, Carol McAusland. † Nouri Najjar is a Ph.D. student in the Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia.

"152931034","null","653039860","Time for Climate Plan B","2011","3","This article describes how policymakers have assumed for 15 years that putting a price on carbon would be an effective strategy for addressing climate change in the United States and around the world. The article shows how nations would price carbon emissions, cap carbon production levels, ratchet down the cap over time, allow carbon emitters to pay for their continued use of carbon but at an ever-increasing cost, and use this market mechanism to price carbon emissions into a steep decline. This market-forcing would spur the introduction of innovative new technologies into energy markets, displacing fossil fuel technologies. The approach derived from the successful use in the United States of cap-and-trade against acid rain under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. At the Kyoto Framework Convention in 1997, the United States persuaded participating nations that the approach would work worldwide against carbon emissions. The subsequent Kyoto Protocol eventually obtained enough signatures to, in theory go into effect, and Europe has enacted a cap-and-trade program. However, the biggest carbon emitters--the United States and China—still have not enacted a cap-and-trade program. The article describes how concerned policymakers have continued to assume that the United States would adopt carbon cap-and-trade over time and then lure in China and other emerging economies. During the most recent session of Congress, they came close. Remarkably, U.S. policymakers never assembled a backup Plan B for carbon pricing. The article shows how the time to develop such a plan is now, because the nation cannot afford to suspend climate efforts for many more years in hopes of a congressional consensus. A new Plan B will need to be more politically viable than the approach recently rejected. Aside from its political vulnerability, cap-and-trade as a stand-alone policy had a structural problem. The acid rain cap-and-trade program in the 1990s was possible because technological solutions were readily available. But few of the technological solutions for climate change are near maturity or ready for deployment on a large scale. The cap-and-trade solution for climate, if prices are set at sound levels, is strong on creating potential markets for innovations but weak on developing needed innovations to feed the new markets. The United States will need a program that encompasses technology push as well as a new means for demand pull, supporting all the technology stages in between, from research through deployment.","[""abstract""]"

"152993818","null","1490576966","An analysis of the economic impacts of Australia's carbon price","2014","0","Climate Change poses a substantial risk to humans and the world‘s ecosystem. Although there is scientific uncertainty in relation to the magnitude that global warming will have, the risk is real. There is a need to acknowledge and reduce the risks of climate change through the implementation of a means to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change is an example of market failure which involves externalities in relation to the consumption and production and the subsequent use public goods. The atmosphere is a common resource that is being exploited and exhausted. Public policy must be implemented to reduce market failure which is why the Australian Government is placing a price on carbon to create a market and promote the reduction of emissions. 
 
The issue of greenhouse gases is a global concern and a solution to human-induced climate change is required through both local and international responses. The Australia Government has implemented a carbon price mechanism which will enable the transition to an Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) that will see the Australian carbon market link with the European Union Carbon Permit Scheme (2015). This corresponds with the aim of promoting international effective climate change mitigation. 
 
 The Australian Government‘s, environmental policy is based on the recommendations of Ross Garnaut. The Garnaut Climate Change Review (2008) was commissioned by Kevin Rudd and by Australia‘s State and Territory Governments on 30 April 2007. In September 2010 Garnaut was selected to be the independent expert advisor to the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee. In November 2010, Garnaut was appointed by the Minister of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency to update his 2008 Garnaut Climate Change Review. The Committee explored the options for the implementation of a carbon price and helped to build consensus on how Australia will tackle the challenge of climate change. The Garnaut Climate Change Review Update (2011) was presented to Government on 31 May 2011. The Climate Change Minister Penny Wong wanted the economic concerns in response to the report to be addressed, thus Treasury modelling in relation to climate change mitigation was provided. Therefore it is Ross Garnaut‘s policy recommendations that formed the foundations of the Australian public policy in relation to climate change mitigation that is now in place. 
 
Climate change is a risk to Australia‘s future prosperity. Global action can reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the level that can lower the risk of dangerous climate change. Effective global agreement and actions are required and the developed world needs to lead. Australia is making a contribution by implementing efficient market-based policies to reduce domestic emissions in a cost-effective way. The Carbon Price Mechanism and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) are the core components of Australia‘s mitigation policy. A low carbon future plan will help provide sustainable lowemission growth that will allow Australia‘s future prosperity. 
 
 In 2011 the Australian Government needed to understand the costs and benefits of the economy meeting its emission reduction targets. The Treasury Department conducted one of largest economic modelling projects ever undertaken in Australia which analysed the potential impacts of reducing emission over the medium to long-term. The Report examines national, global and sectorial areas and refers to the distributional impacts which include the implications of carbon pricing on goods and services that household‘s consume. The Government will continue to analyse the costs and benefits of climate change policy which will make sure Australia makes a substantial contribution to global efforts in relation to climate change mitigation. Australia must take advantage of the transition to a low carbon economy in order to remain competitive, and it must consider renewable energies and sustainable technologies. 
 
The Australia and the global economy will continue to grow as governments cut pollution in order to lower the risk of dangerous climate change. Global action is cheaper than delayed action, the occurrence of a delay will only add to the cost of action as it will imply that there would be more emissions-intensive industry and infrastructure. This would in turn delay investment in low-emissions technology, industry and jobs. A price on carbon will drive structural change in the economy; alter resource direction towards lower emission-intensive industries. This will enable Australia to maintain and improve its competitiveness in a world moving towards a new low-carbon future. 
 
Structural change within the economy will result from the existence of a market-based carbon pricing mechanism, compared with other changes within the economy, those driven by high terms of trade, demographic changes and consumer taste preferences. Treasury indicates the economy will continue to grow strongly, whilst reducing carbon emissions. Treasury policy modelling analysis aim was to provide details of the economic, environmental and social impacts of climate change and the benefits of lowering global emissions. The level of Australia‘s real income per person is expected to be higher with a carbon price than without a price on pollution. For example, real national income per person will slow by one approximately one-tenth of one percentage point per year under a carbon price, with real incomes around $9000 higher in 2020 in relation to today‘s dollars. In 2020 national employment is predicted to increase by 1.6 million with or without a carbon price. Household‘s consumption will face higher prices for highly emissions-intensive products such as electricity and gas (Clean Energy Future 2012).","[""abstract"",""title""]"

The article explains how U.S. climate change policy has begun to grasp this opportunity by supporting clean technology R&D using measures such as grants, subsidies, and low interest loans. Pricing carbon will complement these government policies and further drive green technology development. A price on carbon would also have a range of implications for clean technology innovation and international trade. For instance, a carbon price will lead to growing U.S. demand for green technologies to reduce CO2 emissions, which will incentivize greater levels of global R&D into such technologies. But to maximize the benefits to the United States and globally from the impact of a carbon price on R&D will require a complementary trade policy that lowers barriers to trade in climate change goods and services. At the same time, a carbon price will raise domestic concerns in the United States about carbon leakage and a loss of international competitiveness that is likely to lead to domestic pressure on the government to raise trade barriers on goods from countries not pricing carbon. Effectively managing the global impact from a U.S. carbon price on international trade will determine whether pricing carbon supports trade liberalization and drives greater levels of innovation and R&D or whether it becomes a reason for raising barriers to trade that reduce U.S. and global welfare.","[""abstract""]"

Consequently the exchange rates between different gases - that is their CO2 equivalence - could have significant effects on the cost to New Zealand of meeting international emissions reduction obligations. In order to fully capture world-wide effects, including effects on agricultural commodity prioes, we link a New Zealand specific general equilibrium model (ESSAM) with a global integrated assessment model (MESSAGE)and a global spatially explicit land-use model (GLOBIOM). Results are final: We find that switching from Global Warming Potentials (GWP) to Global Temperature Change Potentials (GTP) would not benefit New Zealand economically if agriculture is priced globally, as the lower emissions liability resulting from the GTP metric for New Zealand would be offset by smaller increases in commodity prices as agricultural production costs would be lowered globally. We also find that New Zealand economic welfare is higher if New Zealand is liable for its agricultural emissions (coupled with a relatively lower carbon price, high commodity prices and global participation), than if agriculture were excluded globally and New Zealand has to face a higher carbon price coupled with lower commodity prices. This finding holds irrespective of the choice of GHG exchange metric for other non-CO2 gases, although it is marginally stronger under the GWP metric than under the GTP metric.","[""abstract""]"

We extend existing studies of carbon sequestration costs in several important ways, while ensuring the transparency of our approach. We clearly identify all components of our cost estimates so that other researchers can reconstruct our results as well as use our data for other purposes. Our cost estimates have five distinguishing features: (1) we estimate costs for each county in the contiguous United States; (2) we include afforestation of rangeland, in addition to cropland and pasture; (3) our opportunity cost estimates account for capitalized returns to future development (including associated option values) in addition to returns to agricultural production; (4) we develop a new set of forest establishment costs for each county; and (5) we incorporate data on Holdridge life zones to limit afforestation in locations where temperature and moisture availability prohibit forest growth. We find that at a carbon price of $50/ton, approximately 200 million tons of carbon would be sequestered annually through afforestation. At a price of $100/ton, an additional 100 million tons of carbon would be sequestered each year. Our estimates closely match those in earlier econometric studies for relatively low carbon prices, but diverge at higher carbon prices. Accounting for climatic constraints on forest expansion has important effects on cost estimates.

"153202720","null","402237226","Essays on CO2","2008","0","The main objective of this dissertation, entitled #Essays on CO2# is to study how carbon markets function from a financial point of view. In application of the Kyoto Protocol, the European Union launched in 2005 the first Phase of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), thus beginning the trading of European Union Allowances (EUA) on organized spot and futures markets. A EUA is the right to emit one ton of CO2 in the European Union. The dissertation is organized in four chapters, each one analysing the European carbon market from a different point of view. Specifically, the first chapter explores the main issues concerning allowance trading in the world and compiles the necessary information for a good understanding of this new financial market. This chapter deconstructs all the singularities of carbon trading and specifically the particularities of carbon trading in Europe. The second chapter analyzes the principal determinants of carbon prices during the first year of the EU ETS (2005). The most representative energy variables in Europe, as well as weather variables, when considered in a non-linear way, show statistical influence on carbon returns during 2005. Additionally, the study will allow us not only to gain insights into the relationship between energy-related variables and CO2 prices, but also to shed light on the functional form between weather variables and CO2 returns. The third chapter examines the impact of regulatory decisions on EUA returns and volatility. The results indicate that news releases concerning both the first and the second phases of the EU ETS had an impact on first phase returns but not on volatility. This leads to the interpretation that there was an information leakage before the European Commission#s official announcement. Finally, the last chapter analyses the opportunities for portfolio diversification that the introduction of EUAs offers to the different investors present on the market. We analyse the characteristics of EUAs in both Phase I and Phase II. We examine these two types of assets as sole investments and in various diversified portfolio made up of several combinations of traditional investments and energy variables. We find that even if the weights of EUAs are not too important when incorporated in an optimal and well diversified portfolio, the efficient frontier shows an increase in investor possibilities. Finally, we find that, in most cases, it is indispensable to allow for short sales.","[""abstract""]"

A substantial proportion of Australia’s emissions are attributable to the coal-fired electricity generation sector. This article examines whether the carbon pricing mechanism will effectively facilitate emissions reduction from the coal-fired electricity sector. Aspects analysed include the legislative constraints placed on the carbon price, the carbon pollution cap and provisions specific to the coal-fired electricity sector, such as transitional assistance. It is concluded that, in practice, the carbon pricing mechanism may not be sufficient in itself to achieve significant reduction in emissions from coal-fired electricity generation or significant investment in clean energy, and that a suite of additional regulatory measures, such as the federal Renewable Energy Target, should operate in conjunction with the mechanism.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This study explicitly considers farmer behavior with respect to agricultural opportunity in carbon offset provision and ability of adaptation to mitigate the production cost impact under a cap-and-trade climate policy. Based on empirically estimated farmer behavior models, a policy simulation with agricultural census data identifies farmer acreage enrollment in carbon offset provision, carbon offset supplies and revenues, the production cost impacts of carbon prices, and impacts on net farm income and their distributions among heterogeneous farmers. Our analysis find that: 1) farmer ex ante preferences in general are biased against participating in carbon credit programs although farmer involvement increases with carbon prices; 2) with the fertilizer industry exempted from cap-and-trade regulation, the production cost impacts would be small, and more than half of the farms or farmland would probably gain for a carbon price higher than $10 per metric ton of carbon; and 3) the production cost impacts with a capped fertilizer industry would be 2 times higher, and more than half of the farms or farmland would lose unless the carbon price could reach beyond $55 per metric ton of carbon. This study sheds some light on agricultural potential to adapt to economy-wide climate change mitigation while providing a bottom-up economic assessment of the costs and benefits of a cap-and-trade climate policy to agricultural producers in the short run.","[""abstract""]"

The results showed the implementation of METS or GHG Fund mechanism would directly cause the ship voyage costs to be increased, while implementation of the EIS and SECT mechanism will cause the capital and operating costs of shipping increased. The discipline of shipping costs changes with fuel prices and carbon prices of some typical types of ships, such as bulk carriers, oil tankers, container ships and ro-ro ships which were studied. The results showed that the implementation of a market mechanism based on the fuel consumption would cause transport costs to be increased, and the higher the carbon prices, the higher the carbon cost. The greatest impact of the shipping costs was on the type of the container ship because such type of a ship is usually operated at a higher speed. With the rise of fuel prices, the proportion of carbon cost in the total costs decreased gradually, indicating that the main motivation of saving energy for ship owners comes from the high marine oil price rather than the carbon tax (or GHG Contribution), especially under the circumstance of the high fuel price.","[""abstract""]"

original mechanism is compared to one in which complex bids are not
allowed. I find that, while firms do exercise market power through
complex bids, the positive coordination benefits of complex bidding
dominate. In the second chapter, I explore the impacts of
cap-and-trade in the Spanish electricity market, quantifying the
rate at which firms internalized the costs of the emissions as well
as the rate at which they passed it through. I find evidence that
supports a full internalization rate at the firm-level, which
results in a partial pass-through due to both demand and supply
factors. Finally, in chapter 3, in joint work with Meredith Fowlie
and Stephen Ryan, we explore the long run dynamic implications of
subjecting an imperfectly competitive industry to market-based
pollution regulation. Using two decades of panel data on the US
Portland cement industry, we estimate a fully dynamic model of
firms' strategic entry, exit, production, and investment decisions.
We then use the model to simulate counterfactual outcomes under
three general classes of allocation regimes: auctioning,
grandfathering, and contingent updating. We find that the

that are currently being debated, including the 2030 Energy and Climate Framework and the 
review of the EU carbon leakage list by 2014. Carbon leakage is the result of asymmetrical 
carbon policies, especially carbon pricing, and the resulting carbon cost, which affects the 
international competitive position of some EU industry and could displace production 
and/or investment, and the emissions of the activities displaced. 
This paper identifies the difference between carbon price and carbon cost to leakage exposed 
industry as one of two fundamental issues to be understood and addressed; lack of 
visibility on future climate policies and anti-leakage provisions is the other key issue. While 
this is a global issue, most of the experience has been accumulated in the EU. Carbon leakage 
is only one of the factors that could affect the competitive position of sectors, but it is 
difficult to attribute the impact of carbon costs versus other variables such as energy costs, 
labour, etc. Studies have predicted the risk of a significant amount of production leakage in a 
number of energy-intensive industries. To address the danger, they were included in the EU 
ETS carbon leakage list, which gave them access to free allowances. However, a limited 
number of studies undertaken after the end of the second trading period (2012) show little 
evidence of production leakage and asks the question whether the issue has not been blown 
out of proportion. 
The paper argues that the past may not be a good representation of the future, as it was 
heavily influenced by a high level of free allocation, the exceptional economic downturn, CO2 
prices significantly below what was anticipated, as well as the potential for changes in some 
fundamental variables such as the shrinking pool of allowances available for free allocation. 
It emphasises the need for a well-informed debate in the EU on measures to address carbon 
leakage post-2020, underpinned by a number of options, and objective criteria to evaluate 
those options. It emphasises that the debate should cover both investment and production 
leakage, caused by both direct and indirect carbon costs.","[""abstract""]"

It notes that this claim assumes that promise to be credible and sufficient to induce the innovations required. It argues that the assumed credibility of such very long commitments is questionable, and hence, even in the best of worlds, the implied benefits are unlikely to arise. For a small country like Australia, the problems are then compounded by the absence of a credible, global agreement on emission reduction. Given that, the marginal benefits of investing in carbon abatement are likely to be very low or negative.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Uncertainties remain but with both major parties proposing to develop an emissions trading regime, it is timely to highlight some important practical issues that will face them on that path. In writing this, we take the case for action as given. There is a scientific consensus that global warming is taking place and that it is, in large part, due to the actions of humans on the planet. The policy prescription is to limit net emissions although the precise technologies that will likely carry the load have yet to be developed. Consequently, in the short-term, behavioural responses are required and to engage in that appropriately a price must be set. Economists disagree as to the way in which a carbon price might be generated. One set of economists (including the Pigou Club led by Greg Mankiw) support a carbon tax. This would fix the price for emissions, leaving the quantity to be determined by the market. Concern has been expressed that reliance on national carbon taxes may forgo opportunities for international cooperation. Other economists favour emissions trading, which involves the quantity being set by governments and the price by markets. The issue with emissions trading is that it is largely unknown how it will operate on national and international scales covering a broad range of activity. As with the design of market mechanisms, some caution needs to be applied. It is that need and the trade-offs inherent in it that we address here.","[""abstract""]"

With additional risks emerging through climate change mitigation mechanisms, the propensity to invest may increasingly depend upon how each technology and company is exposed to carbon price uncertainty. We approach this by estimating the cumulative probabilities of investment over time in various technologies as a function of behavioral, policy, financial and market assumptions. Using a multistage stochastic optimization model with exogenous uncertainty in carbon price, we demonstrate that detailed financial analysis with real options and risk constraints can make substantial difference to the investment propensities compared to conventional economic analysis. Further, we show that the effects of different carbon policies and market instruments on these decision propensities depend on the characteristics of the companies and may induce market structure evolution.","[""abstract""]"

However, there continues to be heated debate about the nature, content and, most importantly, about the impact of the policy actions needed to limit greenhouse gas emissions. One major contributing factor is the lack of systematic evidence on the impact of mitigation policy on the welfare of the poor in developing countries. This paper provides quantitative evidence on the poverty impacts of climate change mitigation polices. We consider a scenario whereby a carbon price of $27/tCO2eq is applied to all sectors in all Annex I regions along with a forest carbon sequestration subsidy to all regions. Using a novel economic-climate policy analysis framework, we assess the poverty impacts of the above policy scenario on seven socio-economic groups in 14 developing countries. In general, we find that such a policy scenario increases poverty in 11 out of the 14 countries in our sample. There are, however, differences when we decompose the scenario by policy drivers, including Annex I taxes on CO2 emissions, a tax on Annex I non-CO2 emissions coupled with a forest carbon sequestration subsidy in Annex I countries, and finally, a carbon forest sequestration subsidy in the non-Annex I countries, paid for by the rich countries. More specifically, the non-fossil fuel GHG tax in Annex I countries boosts agricultural production and helps reduce poverty in countries where there are large concentration of the poor in the agricultural stratum. The fossil fuel tax in Annex I countries is, on average, poverty reducing in the sample of 14 developing countries considered here, but the magnitude of the impact is much smaller. A combination of both fossil fuel and non-fossil fuel GHG taxes in the Annex I region, is more effective at reducing poverty in developing countries. Our results show that a forest carbon sequestration subsidy in the developing countries leads to increased poverty and that happens to be the dominating sub-component of the policy package. There are two forces at work here. One is that such a subsidy bids land away from agriculture and brings substantial benefits to land owners. However, the elasticity of poverty to income changes to land is very small for most countries and this translates to smaller changes to poverty reduction. Furthermore, the subsidy bids land away from agriculture and leads to decline in output of the sector and hence factor income. For most countries, the latter effect seem to dominate and hence the worsening poverty. The second impact is that the inflow of the transfer creates a “Dutch disease” effect, which affects the manufacturing output negatively and reduces non-agricultural income substantially.","[""abstract""]"

Third, instead of the old cash-for-cuts approach -- which relies on the industrial countries offering cash (which they do not have) to the dynamic emerging economies for cuts (that they are unwilling to make) -- all major emitters must make contributions. With a view to galvanizing a technology revolution, industrial countries would take early action to raise carbon prices. The dynamic emerging economies would in turn eliminate fossil fuel subsidies, commit to matching carbon price increases in the future, allow limited border taxes against their own exports, and strengthen protection of intellectual property for green technologies.

The model demonstrates that the volatilities are affected by the MAC curve shape and the emission reduction volume while the correlations are indifferent from the MAC curve shape and affected by the emission reduction behavior.

A review is provided of the predominant top-down cap-and-trade policies in place – the Kyoto Protocol and EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) – with a focus on the grandfathering of emissions entitlements and the possibility of offsetting emissions.

To estimate the effect of policies on market clearing prices, we constructed hourly economic dispatch models of the generators in PJM and in ERCOT. We find that the cost effectiveness of policies for consumers is strongly dependent on the price of natural gas and on the characteristics of the generators in the dispatch stack. If gas prices are low (~$4/MMBTU), a technology-agnostic, rational consumer seeking to minimize costs would prefer a carbon price over an RPS in both regions. Expensive gas (~$7/MMBTU) requires a high carbon price to induce fuel switching and this leads to wealth transfers from consumers to low carbon producers. The RPS may be more cost effective for consumers because the added energy supply lowers market clearing prices and reduces CO2 emissions. We find that both policies have consequences in capacity markets and that the RPS can be more cost effective than a carbon price under certain circumstances: continued excess supply of capacity, retention of nuclear generators, and high natural gas prices.","[""abstract""]"

The scheme is one of the broadest and most comprehensive domestic offset schemes of its type in the world. Its formal objectives are to assist in the achievement of Australia's greenhouse gas mitigation obligations and promote abatement in a manner that will protect the environment and improve resilience to the effects of climate change. Most significantly, the CFI will provide the basis for the generation of certified offsets for use in the Australian carbon pricing scheme under the Clean Energy Act 2011 (Cth) (CE Act) and for sale to overseas buyers. It will also certify domestic offsets for use in voluntary markets. This article describes and analyses key aspects of the CFI and sheds light on its relationship with the international greenhouse accounting rules and the CE Act's carbon pricing scheme. It also evaluates the effectiveness of the mechanisms that have been put in place to deal with integrity risks and secondary impacts associated with the scheme. It is concluded that the CFI has the capacity to significantly reduce the cost of meeting Australia's mitigation targets and promote more sustainable land-management practices.

Since the administrative costs are relatively low, such a scheme could provide a simpler, cheaper and more practical alternative to personal carbon trading, while at the same time delivering comparable economic and environmental benefits. The incentive effect for downstream consumers would be similar to a carbon tax. However, instead of a fixed and visible tax rate, the carbon price would be variable and largely hidden within the price of fuel. Consideration is given to the distributional impacts of the scheme and the potential benefits of linking to the EU ETS—including improved liquidity, reduced price volatility and reduced scope for exercising market power.

However, the viability of emission reduction projects like RETs is technology- and country-specific. To improve the CDM with respect to the diffusion of RETs, it is crucial to understand the factors that ultimately drive or hinder investments in these technologies. This study develops a methodology based on project-level, regional and global variables that can systematically assess the financial and environmental performance of CDM projects in different country contexts. We quantitatively show how six RETs (PV, wind, hydro, biomass, sewage, landfill) are impacted differently by the CDM and how this impact depends on regional conditions. While sewage and landfill are strongly affected independently of their location; wind, hydro and biomass projects experience small to medium impacts through the carbon price, and strongly depend on regional conditions. PV depends more on regional conditions than on the carbon price but is always unprofitable. Furthermore, we determine the carbon prices necessary to push these six RETs to profitability under various regional conditions. Based on these results, we derive policy recommendations to advance the interplay between international and domestic climate policy to further incentivize GHG emission reductions from RETs.","[""abstract""]"

By creating financial incentives to reduce forest-sourced greenhouse gases, REDD projects could generate funding from developed countries to reduce deforestation in developing countries. In addition, some climate change specialists believe that REDD projects could benefit forest-dependent communities, whose participation is key to controlling the local forces that drive deforestation.2 Some communities are already learning about the new REDD carbon projects. As one villager from Cambodia explains, ""We are going to sell our air to the people who are polluting in the city.The increased attention to forests in international climate change negotiations indicates that policymakers are giving greater recognition to the importance of natural forests as terrestrial carbon sinks. While it is generally acknowledged that forests are an important source of timber, fuelwood, fodder, and other nontimber forest products, forests also provide crucial ecosystem services. These ""services"" are functions or benefits that are provided by the natural environment including sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, protecting upstream watersheds, and conserving biodiversity. Forests also help regulate the water cycle and climate, while supporting soil formation, nutrient recycling, and plant pollination. The failure of markets, and society in general, to accurately value these services in economic or financial terms has undermined attempts to conserve forests.3 The REDD climate initiatives represent an important international attempt to place a value on forests and to commoditize their services in storing and sequestering carbon. The value of forest carbon stocks will need to be based on rigorous monitoring of field inventories and remotely sensed data. It is anticipated that REDD projects will need to empirically demonstrate that deforestation and forest degradation have slowed as a direct result of project activities. The resulting change in carbon storage will need to be verifiable before it can be traded in commodity markets and other exchange platforms.Between 2000 and 2005, forest cover in Southeast Asia decreased by 2.76 million hectares annually, or 1.3 percent, representing a total loss in that five-year period of 13.8 million hectares.4 While industrial forest clearing and degradation have resulted in immense carbon emissions into the atmosphere, they have also affected hundreds of millions of forestdependent peoples who rely on forest resources for their subsistence. New climate change agreements that place a monetary value on the conservation of natural forests have the potential to support a new generation of sustainable forest management strategies implemented by resident peoples. However, a recent study found that, under prevailing market conditions, commercial crops like palm oil offered higher returns than those available for conserving forest carbon sinks.In tropical countries, like Malaysia and Indonesia, the net present value of a 30-year palm oil concession was $3,800 to $9,600 per hectare. This compares to just $614 to $994 per hectare net present value that could be expected under a REDD mechanism in the voluntary carbon market.5Forest carbon prices are not fixed, but could rise in the future. If REDD is implemented at a landscape level, potential revenues are quite significant. For example, a recent study in the province of East Kalimantan, Indonesia, estimated that 305 million tons of carbon dioxide (C02) could be conserved between 2003 and 2013 if the province's protected areas were effectively conserved. …","[""abstract""]"
"153961840","null","1874469036","Multi-objective optimisation of Integrated Community Energy Systems and assessment of the impact on households","2015","4","Sustainability has gained considerable interest at all levels in society during the last decades. Climate change has been a large contributor to this mentality change. As current energy systems are inefficient and contribute to climate change, a transition towards more efficient energy systems is sought. The share of local produced energy in the total energy mix increases, for example through small scale solar installations at household level. Integrated Community Energy Systems (ICES) is a community energy concept that looks into the optimal integration of distributed energy sources and engage local communities, as a solution to the drawbacks of the current energy system. These drawbacks include: notable transmission losses, significant carbon emission, flexibility limitations and a primarily one-dimensional structural design. ICES deals with these drawbacks and allows energy exchange between community members. This multi-source multi-product energy network framework is a broad and flexible concept that involves all facets of energy within a community. Within this research, focus lies on household level energy demand and production, although ICES is able to cover a wider variety of energy forms and carriers. This research uses a bottom-up approach and analyses different demand profiles at household level and a selection of available energy generation technologies (with its typical production profiles). Thereby the flows of energy within ICES are studied and evaluated for different technology mixes, different community preferences and different community compositions. The goal of this research is to determine to what extent ICES can contribute to energy autonomy and at the same time, to the reduction of CO2 emission. Therefore a multi-objective optimisation of ICES is performed, in which the different available technologies, community preferences and community compositions are considered. The three optimisation preferences are: energy costs minimisation, CO2 emission reduction and energy autonomy maximisation. The main focus lies on the impact this optimisation has on households. A literature study and a stakeholder analysis are performed to identify the most suitable technologies to implement. A state-of-the-art ICES model is designed in MATLAB, to provide founded outcomes and to underpin the answers to the research questions. With this tool, the optimal technology mix is determined, based on different community specific parameters, valued on their technical, economic and environmental impact. Model input parameters include: demand profiles, weather data, and production profiles. The ICES model consists of two main parts. First a model on household level is designed, which is used to select the optimal technology mix for each type of household and for each optimisation preference. Different technologies are implemented to fulfil energy needs. Energy exchange with the electricity grid allows households to trade excess energy. The four types of households that are considered are: one adult household, two adult household, family household and pensioner household. Three performance indicators are mapped to quantify the performance of the technology mix at household level: energy price, CO2 emission and energy autonomy. The optimisation process at household level results in twelve optimal technology mixes. These twelve sub-results are used in the ICES model. Results of the household level model are stored and loaded in the ICES level model. With the ICES level model, the selected households with their optimal technology mix are combined to form an energy community. Stored household parameters are initialised (e.g. performance indicators, residual energy demand and excess energy profiles). An algorithm is developed, to distribute any excess energy among households that could not fulfil their own demand. Community ideology has a central role during the distribution of energy within ICES. Energy is imported from other community members at average levelised costs of energy production (LCOE). At each particular hour of the day, all households that import energy from ICES pay the same price per kWh for this energy. Households that export energy to ICES receive their full LCOE. Thereby they cover their investment costs, but are not stimulated to over-invest or over-produce. Energy is allocated to the demanding households in ratio to their demand. Energy exchanges within ICES is encouraged by this pricing mechanism. Energy that is being exported within ICES, is allocated to the exporting households in proportion of their total production in relation to the total ICES production. Exporting revenues and benefits from importing, thereby are equally distributed amongst contributing households. Energy that is not being used within ICES is exported to the grid at APX price. Demand that cannot be fulfilled within ICES is being supplied by the grid, at retail price. The outcome of the household level optimisation shows, for a purely financial optimisation preference (over a lifetime of 20 years), a 10% energy costs reduction is possible. This also results in a 25% CO2 reduction. With the use of ICES, energy costs and CO2 emission both reduce by another 10%. There are slight variations between results from different community compositions (less than 5% variation). The initial optimisation preference is of higher influence than the community composition. CO2 emission optimisation shows a larger CO2 emission reduction is possible, however energy costs increase quickly when opting for a large reduction of carbon emission. A 50% CO2 reduction is conceivable at ICES level, however this will increase the energy costs by 60%. In the case of CO2 reduction maximisation, almost all reduction is ascribed to the implemented technologies and ICES has little impact. This is also due to the fact that a low carbon intensive configuration exploits as much distributed generation as possible, implying a high energy autonomy at household level. Energy autonomy optimization is expensive and inefficient at household level. The technology mix that is able to supply peak demand, is largely over dimensioned during low demand hours. This is expensive, since investment is made for the full capacity. It is inefficient because technologies operate most of the time far below their optimal operating point. Also low annual energy production in comparison with the installed capacity causes high LCOE. Demand peaks will result in a technology mix that is able to supply the occasional occurring demand peaks, but essentially for the largest part of the time is over dimensioned. Without ICES, the export of excess energy is less profitable. Of all performance indicators, the largest contribution of ICES is observed in energy autonomy. Besides the different community compositions and technology mixes, a selection of additional scenarios is analysed. The different scenarios that are studied are electric vehicle (EV) penetration, stationary storage penetration, carbon pricing, scale effect and non-energy-producing household implementation. The electricity exchange price exponentially increases at high EV penetration level. A low EV penetration level has no negative effect, as long as there is sufficient available excess energy within ICES. The first EV owners and the last households without EV will benefit the most from ICES. The time mismatch between EV charging hours and renewable peak production asks for a solution, such as load shifting or temporary storage of renewable energy that is not used at time of production. The effect of stationary storage at household level, strongly relates with the effect ICES has on the performance indicators at household level. A high penetration ratio of stationary storage increases households’ individual performance, but this also means the contribution of ICES becomes less. When batteries are installed at all households, the total energy exchange within ICES reduces with 85%. Due to the (still) high capital costs of batteries, the total energy costs are lower when using ICES instead of batteries, while the overall performance is comparable. The financial effect of carbon pricing is relatively small, compared to the total annual energy costs and is calculated to be 150 on annual base at most. The effect of scale shows that an increased number of households slightly increases the carbon reduction and energy autonomy. Adding non-energy-producing households is possible without noticeably reducing performance indicators, up to a level of 20%. This research shows ICES has potential to reduce carbon emission (with maximum 50%), increase energy autonomy (up to 100%) and reduce energy costs (with maximum 20%). The multi-objective optimum is found at 20% CO2 emission reduction, 95% energy autonomy and 20% energy costs reduction. This shows ICES can be a promising solution in the trajectory towards a more efficient and low-carbon energy system. When the observed barriers are reduced and the right technology mix is used, ICES offers a valuable contribution to the reduction of CO2 emission at affordable costs. It offers perspective to an energy system that emphasizes on community engagement and equity for its community members.","[""abstract""]"

We evaluate the impact of the B.C. carbon tax and the proposed Australian carbon pricing proposal on indigenous communities, and offer a comparative analysis of carbon taxes and emissions trading regimes as they relate to fairness. As already well established in the literature, regressivity of carbon pricing instruments is a critical part of any fairness assessment. However, we have argued that there are a number of socio-economic and cultural factors characteristic of certain groups, such as indigenous communities, that may lead to a double burden of regressivity. In other words, the impact of carbon pricing policies is affected by more than income levels. We conclude that carbon pricing policies have the potential to be designed in a way that is fair to indigenous communities, but that -- not surprisingly -- the devil is in the details. Both emissions-trading schemes and carbon taxes have cost implications for disadvantaged groups such as indigenous peoples, but they can both be designed in a way that compensates fairly for these impacts, using revenues from within or outside the pricing policy. Ultimately, it is a political choice.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

In 2008 a more stringent cap but still high price volatility was observed. Based on experience from the first years of the EU ETS the design of the EU ETS will be changed for the post-Kyoto period (2013-2020) including an EU-wide cap and the use of auctioning as the main allocation principle. So far, no measures to control price volatility are envisaged. This issue however gains in importance in the political and economic debate as prices are an important signal for investment decisions. More or less stable price signals are essential for the environmental effectiveness of an emissions trading scheme. As evidence shows, this is not necessarily guaranteed by the market process.

Given such a dismal outcome the policy game should be changed to the global price-target game. In the same setting where cap-and-trade reduces abatement, this game induces optimal abatement.

The industrial sector accounts for over a fifth of UK primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy intensive industry is uniquely restricted in the way it uses energy and emits greenhouse gasses. In this thesis, the potential of radical measures to achieve significant energy demand reduction and emissions abatement in UK energy intensive industry is assessed. Adopted is a multidisciplinary approach combining thermodynamic and techno-economic analysis techniques. Bottom-up assessments are applied to key energy intensive sectors of industry to capture the diverse and interactive array of technological characteristics invisible from a top-down perspective. Detailed projection models are built to design and analyse technology roadmaps for the sectors out to 2050. In an illustrative roadmap assessment, the technological pathways of radical process transition and carbon sequestration were each shown to achieve about 80% abatement in 2050 from 1990 emissions levels. Radical process transition achieved greater abatement before 2030 and this was reflected in lower cumulative emissions over the full period. Higher risk is associated with carbon sequestration from its reliance on timely access to CO2 transport and storage technology to compensate for lower short-medium term abatement. Although, combining carbon sequestration with high levels of biomass combustion indicated the largest potential abatement to 2050. Abatement economics in the iron and steel sector are notably sensitive to resource costs and the carbon trading price. The carbon trading price influences relative production costs in favour of higher abating pathways, but increases absolute costs. This signals the need for supportive policy measures that accelerate technology development and deployment while mitigating the risk of the carbon trading price to competitiveness. Some carbon capture technologies reduce relative production cost even in the absence of a carbon price, but this excludes the cost of CO2 transport and storage. Meanwhile, radical process transition pathways have a higher dependence on the future prices of natural gas, electricity, and scrap. Future work should focus on expanding the economic appraisal to other sectors and to indirect costs, as well as incorporating wider material efficiency strategies and running different future scenarios.","[""abstract""]"

Indeed, such conflict is likely even were a post-Kyoto global climate change regime to fail to develop. Trade conflict may be unavoidable in a world of uncoordinated and conflicting national responses to global climate change.The international trade politics of GHG limits are complex. Both cap-and-trade and carbon tax approaches will increase the cost of production of energy-intensive goods. Some important categories of internationally traded goods, such as steel and cement, are particularly affected. The shock of cost escalation will drive local producers to scrutinize the cost of carbon paid by rivals producing in other countries. New cries of unfair trade will likely sound in the event that there are (as there likely will be) large disparities in the prices of carbon between different WTO members. Differentials in national carbon prices are artifacts of the GHG emissions caps implemented by various states. It is carbon price differentials which are at the heart of the international trade/climate change collision.Assuming that some form of import restriction will be an inevitable accompaniment to domestic carbon emission limits, there is a range of tools available. Whatever the political appeal of border adjustments, their practical administration is daunting. Implementing border adjustments will likely involve high expense and considerable inaccuracy. Crude results will result in either ineffective discrimination or an unfair burden on trade. As such, a proposal for border adjustments may fall under its own weight. Occasional and exceptional measures - import restrictions as a trade remedy, modeled on anti-dumping duties, countervailing duties, and safeguard actions - may be a better solution than widely and routinely applicable border tax adjustments.","[""abstract""]"

We discuss the main types of compliance buyers’ responses to the EU ETS constraint: emissions reductions, acquisitions of additional compliance assets, and other responses. We present the results of an empirical survey of the most carbon constrained European utilities. We show that strategic and economic considerations prevailed over the introduction of the carbon price. We discuss the impact of those investments on European utilities’ EU ETS profile by looking at the potentially locked-in emissions, changes in the compliance perimeter and some specific developments relative to carbon leakage and Kyoto offsets. We offer a review of the investment decision-making approaches. Exploring the impact of carbon price scenarios on generation investment portfolios, we are able to identify that: the EU ETS has a moderate but central reallocation role in power generation investment portfolios; insights into the long-term carbon price trend are particularly helpful to unlock investment; some much discussed policy provisions only have a relatively small impact on investment portfolios; carbon price expectations impact decisions relative to power generation investment portfolios; while the EU ETS has a central role, the climate and non-climate policy mix matters most.","[""abstract""]"

The Implications of Linking Canada - US Greenhouse Gas Policies","2010","16","The Canadian and American economies are inextricably intertwined through trade. As the two countries debate plans to curb greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, policymakers in both countries must consider how emissions policies, such as an emissions trading system that sets economy-wide limits on GHG emissions and allows firms to trade GHG emissions permits for the right to pollute, might coexist. This paper analyzes the implications of linking elements of potential Canadian and American GHG emissions trading systems, including the scope of emissions covered by the systems, national emissions-reduction targets, emissions permit prices, and cross-border trade of emissions permits. This assessment indicates that linked allowance trade with the US would not necessarily be the best policy for Canada to pursue, as the US develops its own system. Instead, Canada should forge ahead with its own system, while minimizing the risk of getting too far out of step with the US on relative carbon prices. A policy of “go-it-alone” with similar carbon price expectations, and a targeted innovation agenda, seems to be a low-risk strategy for Canada as it develops its emissions policies.","[""abstract""]"

This impending development provides an ideal setting to investigate the impact an ETS in Australia will have on the market valuation of Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) firms. This is the first empirical study into the pricing effects of the ETS in Australia. Primarily, we hypothesize that firm value will be negatively related to a firm's carbon intensity profile. That is, there will be a greater impact on firm value for high carbon emitters in the period prior (2007) to the introduction of the ETS, whether for reasons relating to the existence of unbooked liabilities associated with future compliance and/or abatement costs, or for reasons relating to reduced future earnings. Using a sample of 58 Australian listed firms (constrained by the current availability of emissions data) which comprise larger, more profitable and less risky listed Australian firms, we first undertake an event study focusing on five distinct information events argued to impact the probability of the proposed ETS being enacted. Here, we find direct evidence that the capital market is indeed pricing the proposed ETS. Second, using a modified version of the Ohlson (1995) valuation model, we undertake a valuation analysis designed not only to complement the event study results, but more importantly to provide insights into the capital market's assessment of the magnitude of the economic impact of the proposed ETS as reflected in market capitalization. Here, our results show that the market assesses the most carbon intensive sample firms a market value decrement relative to other sample firms of between 7% and 10% of market capitalization. Further, based on the carbon emission profile of the sample firms we imply a ‘future carbon permit price’ of between AUD$17 per tonne and AUD$26 per tonne of carbon dioxide emitted. This study is more precise than industry reports, which set a carbon price of between AUD$15 to AUD$74 per tonne.","[""abstract""]"

Industry claims that a price on carbon will increase costs, putting them at a competitive disadvantage and that production will shift to a country with no carbon pricing, thus increasing global emissions. This suggests that carbon pricing will cause jobs to be lost through a loss of competitiveness and global emissions to increase through carbon leakage. If these assertions are true, then policy makers may need to, for example, subsidize threatened industries and apply border tax adjustments to equalize the carbon price. These claims can now be tested thanks to the EU’s Emissions Trading System (ETS). Industry does not appear to have left the EU, although industry has received generous subsidies [101]. Global emissions, conversely, have increased substantially but few would claim this is due to the EU ETS [1]. Does ana lysis of the EU ETS and global emission development provide any insight into how to manage carbon leakage in a world of unequal carbon prices? Global emissions have grown substantially in the last decade, primarily due to the emergence of China as a global power [1]. Detailed studies show that approximately a third of Chinese emissions are due to the production of exported products representing up to a half of the growth in Chinese emissions [2]. In terms of carbon leakage, the key issue is whether this growth is partially due to carbon pricing. The growth of Chinese exports destined for the EU, the USA and developing countries has been similar [2], which indicates that climate policy is not the cause of Chinese growth, otherwise the differential climate policies would presumably cause differential growth patterns. Studies on carbon leakage due to the EU ETS show that leakage is small overall, despite being important in some industries in some locations [101]. Confirming this are studies that show that environmental regulations do not drive investment decisions [3]. The available evidence suggests, therefore, that current carbon leakage is negligible. Yet, the rapid changes in international trade show that a significant share of the growth in emissions in countries without carbon pricing occurs in order to meet consumption in countries with carbon pricing. This apparent contradiction can be resolved by taking a more holistic view of carbon leakage [4]. Carbon leakage, by its nature, is a component of international trade and great care is needed to separate the share of international trade that is due to carbon leakage [5]. From a broader perspective, one may first ask how international trade affects the distribution of greenhouse gas emissions between countries [6] and then ask the much harder question on what share of that is due to climate policy [5]. Based on this broader perspective, carbon leakage can be defined in two ways [4,7]:","[""abstract""]"

There are a number of reasons for this, including the United States’ failure to enact Federal cap-and-trade climate legislation, the uncertainty about global climate governance after 2012, as well as the economic crisis and the increasing level of public debt. However, national carbon pricing under the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) will continue, and other regions and countries (e.g. California, Australia, China and South Korea) are developing or considering applying similar approaches by means of taxes or allowances. A major concern for policy makers is that such unilateral policies are faced with claims about the risk of decreasing national industrial competitiveness and increasing carbon leakage in a globalized world. This concern was evident in the draft US national cap-and-trade system, which included the application of border adjustments to ensure that jobs are not outsourced to countries that do not have adequate climate policy measures (EPA, 2009). In the EU ETS also, the inclusion of importers into the scheme is an option that might address these concerns, and such border measures have been debated repeatedly (EurActiv, 2010). The existence of carbon pricing in a world of unequal participation will keep alive the debate on the interface between trade and climate policy, as well as potential measures (e.g. tariffs) to reduce the relocation of emissions to countries without such a policy.

What parameters must the players in the market consider when trying to assess the impact of future carbon prices? This article analyses a number of key factors that will influence the price of emission allowances in the EU emissions trading system in the 2005–2007 period, including: policy and regulatory issues; market fundamentals, including weather and production levels; together with technical indicators. While overall allocation sets the starting point for the market, it is shown that other factors, such as the impact of weather on power demand and relative fuel prices, will be driving prices in the short- to medium-term.

A well-designed carbon tax can be an efficient instrument for reducing emissions, yet whether it will be implemented in an efficient manner is uncertain. A legislatively determined tax may not fully reflect up-to-date scientific and economic information. Behavioral and institutional factors suggest that a tax may not have its fully intended effect. These considerations suggest that climate policy should and will continue to be a complex mix of regulations at various levels of government, even with a carbon price. Nonetheless, the possibility of unintended interactions among policies remains. The role for policies to encourage renewables and energy efficiency depends on the stringency of the carbon tax and presence of externalities related to technological learning and the energy efficiency gap.","[""abstract""]"

Climate Change Policies in the UK","2014","0","Introduction Large, multinational companies like Baxter International Inc. (Baxter) are increasingly exposed to costs and risks related to climate change policy. The government regulations aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions are evolving with significant spatial, temporal, and logistical variability. The resulting uncertainty presents a challenge to businesses attempting to develop climate change strategies that align with performance goals and stakeholder expectations. Through active engagement, low-regret choices, and sustainability initiatives, leading companies have been able to reduce costs and even create business opportunities in the short-term. However, the potential value to managing long-term carbon emissions-related costs and opportunities remains largely untapped. This study seeks to evaluate future policy possibilities in order to inform long-term strategic investments and decisions that will allow global companies to better manage these risks and possibly gain a competitive advantage. The research focuses specifically on the future consequences of emission management systems in the United Kingdom. Recognized for the advanced state of its carbon tax and trading schemes, the UK is a useful case study for evaluating the impacts to business and anticipating future outcomes in other countries. The UK is also an important manufacturing and customer base for Baxter. The effects of carbon pricing will be felt throughout the value chain, from increased costs of supplies, to higher energy costs, to demands for energy efficient products and services. This study focused on the policy implications for Baxter's manufacturing plants for several reasons: Baxter is accountable for plant emissions; carbon pricing will translate directly to increase plant operating costs; plant emissions are directly controllable; and plant energy use represents a significant portion of Baxter's emissions and costs. The study quantifies the price effects of long-term climate change policies in the UK on electricity and natural gas, which are the primary sources of energy and emissions for manufacturing facilities. Projections of alternative "" policy scenarios "" are developed to examine the price implications if policies are more or less stringent than currently expected. The projections also include wholesale energy price sensitivity, which greatly influence electricity and gas prices, and have significant future uncertainty. The electricity and gas prices are projected to 2030 using an Excel model developed for this study. The model is also designed to replicate Baxter manufacturing plant conditions in order to project costs and 4 greenhouse gas emissions at the plant level.

These scenarios are analyzed separately and jointly to determine which of the three scenarios is expected to have the largest impact on net (emissions - sequestration) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, renewable fuels feedstock supply, and producer net returns. Land use choices included conventional crops of rice, cotton, soybean, corn, grain sorghum, pasture, and hay. Specialty crops of loblolly pine and switchgrass were modeled for their respective potential to sequester carbon and provide feedstock for renewable fuels. GHG emissions were measured across an array of production methods for each crop. Soil and lumber carbon sequestration was based on yield, soil texture, and tillage. Using the concept of additionality in which net GHG emissions reductions compared with a baseline level were rewarded at a carbon price of $15 per ton along with $40 per dry ton of switchgrass, baled at field side, revealed that irrigation restrictions had the largest negative impact on producer net returns while also lowering net GHG emissions. Introducing the higher carbon price led to minor positive income ramifications and greatly reduced net GHG emissions. Biomass production returns were higher than the returns from the carbon offset market, however, at the cost of greater net GHG emissions. The combination of all factors led to a significant increase in switchgrass and pine production. In this scenario, approximately 16% of the total income losses with lower nonirrigated yields were offset with returns from biomass and carbon markets. Lowest statewide net GHG emissions were achieved given least irrigation fuel use and a greater than 15% increase in carbon sequestration with pine and switchgrass.","[""abstract""]"

On the island of Sulawesi in the vicinity of the Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP), many smallholders contribute to conversion processes at the forest margin as a result of their agricultural practices. Specifically the area dedicated to cocoa plantations has increased from zero (1979) to nearly 18,000 hectares (2001). Some of these plots have been established inside the 220,000 hectares of the LLNP. An intensification process is observed with a consequent reduction of the shade tree density. This study assesses which impact carbon sequestration payments for forest management systems have on the prevailing land use systems. Additionally, the level of incentives is determined which motivates farmers to desist from further deforestation and land use intensification activities. Household behaviour and resource allocation is analysed with a comparative static linear programming model. As these models prove to be a reliable tool for policy analysis, the output can indicate the adjustments in resource allocation and land use shifts when introducing compensation payments. The data was collected in a household survey in six villages around the LLNP. Four household categories are identified according to their dominant agroforestry systems. These range from low intensity management with a high degree of shading to highly intensified systems with no shade cover. At the plot level, the payments required for inducing the adoption of more sustainable land use practices are the highest for the full shade cocoa agroforestry system, but with low carbon prices of €5 tCO2e-1 these constitute 5 percent of the cocoa gross margin. Focusing on the household level, however, an increase up to 18 percent of the total gross margin can be realised. Furthermore, for differentiated carbon prices up to €32 tCO2e-1 the majority of the households have an incentive to adopt the more sustainable shade intensive agroforestry system. Additionally, the results show that the deforestation activities of most households could be stopped with current carbon prices.","[""abstract""]"

The most radical suggestions involve granting emissions rights to individuals—known as ‘personal carbon trading’ (PCT). A taxonomy is provided of various proposed design options along with consideration of the previously neglected issue of who surrenders the emissions rights and how this is enforced. PCT relies on an enforcement system in which the penalty level determines the price at which constrained actors will breach the cap. Breaching the cap may require a ‘safety valve’ option to cap carbon prices at politically acceptable levels. This could weaken the argument that PCT guarantees certainty of the environmental outcome. Enforcement is examined for three sets of actors: primary fuel suppliers (upstream), suppliers of final energy (midstream), and the final users themselves (downstream). The choice leads to very different consequences for the design and political economy of the resulting carbon markets. Although upstream enforcement is relatively straightforward, it would not lead to the strong involvement of individuals in carbon markets. Midstream enforcement could encourage more citizen engagement, but cannot guarantee it. Downstream enforcement through end-users would be administratively complex and is politically unlikely.","[""abstract""]"

Previous research has studied the distribution of direct emissions by households, notably from domestic fuel and electricity, but this is the first to cover the indirect emissions embodied in the consumption of food, consumer goods and services, including imports. To study total emissions by British households we link an input-output model of the UK economy to the UK Expenditure and Food Survey. Results are presented as descriptive statistics followed by regression analysis. All categories of per capita emission rise with income which is the main driver. Two other variables are always significant: household composition, partly reflecting economies of scale in consumption and emissions in larger households, and employment status. This 'standard' model explains 35% of variation in total emissions, reflecting further variation within income groups and household types. We also compute the distribution of emissions derived from the consumption of welfare state services: here, lower income and pensioner households 'emit' more due to their greater use of these services. To take further account of the social implications of these findings, we first estimate emissions per £ of income. This shows a reverse slope with emissions per £ rising as one descends the income scale. The decline with income is especially acute for domestic energy, housing and food emissions, 'necessary' expenditures with a lower income elasticity of demand. Next, we move away from per capita emissions by assuming children under 14 emit half that of adults, which reduces disparities between household types. To implement personal carbon allowances, further research will be needed into the carbon allowances of children and single person households. Current government policies to raise carbon prices mainly in domestic energy are found to be especially regressive, but tracking total carbon consumption within a country would require radical changes in monitoring carbon flows at national borders.

The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of discount rate and carbon price uncertainty on municipal water distribution infrastructure investments in Canada. A non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is coupled with the hydraulic solver EPANET2 in a single-objective optimization approach to identify network expansion solutions that minimize: i) capital cost of installing new and parallel pipes and of cleaning and lining existing pipes; ii) operation cost of electricity for pumping water; and iii) carbon cost levied on electricity used for pumping water. The optimization approach is used in a parametric analysis to examine the impact of cement-mortar ductile iron (DCLI) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe materials on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the all-pipes water network in Amherstview, Ontario, Canada. The Amherstview water distribution system was optimized for a range of discount rates and carbon prices reflective of possible climate change abatement strategies in Canada over the next 50-years. Preliminary results demonstrate that the discount rate and carbon price trajectories investigated had no significant influence on the total mass of GHGs emitted in the Amherstview system. Pipe material selection was also found to minimally affect the amount of GHG emitted in the Amherstview system. Insensitivity of GHG emissions in the Amherstview system to changes in discount rate and carbon tax may be attributable to a number of factors including, the use of a time-declining GHG emission intensity factor, the lack of available Canadian pipe embodied energy data and the exclusion of tank and pump sizing from the water distribution system expansion problem. Further research is needed to confirm these findings of the Amherstview study.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

The ongoing planned linkage between the European Union’s carbon market and a new emission trading system in Australia in 2015 would be an important attempt to the practice of building up an international carbon market across different regions. To understand the abatement effect of such a global carbon market and to study its energy and economic impact on different market participants, this article adopts a global dynamic computable general equilibrium model with a detailed representation of the interactions between energy and economic systems. Our model includes 20 economic sectors and 19 regions, and describes in detail 17 energy technologies. Bundled with fossil fuel consumptions, the emission permits are considered to be essential inputs in each of the production and consumption activities in the economic system to simulate global carbon market policies. Carbon emission permits are endogenously set in the model, and can be traded between sectors and regions. Considering the current development of the global carbon market, this study takes 2020 as the study period. Four scenarios (reference scenario, independent carbon market scenario, Europe Union (EU)–Australia scenario, and China-EU-Australia scenario) are designed to evaluate the impact of the global carbon market involving China, the EU, and Australia. We find that the carbon price in the three countries varies a lot, from $32/tCO2 in Australia, to $17.5/tCO2 in the EU, and to $10/tCO2 in China. Though the relative emission reduction (3%) in China is lower than that in the EU (9%) and Australia (18%), the absolute emission reduction in China is far greater than that in the EU and Australia. When China is included in the carbon market, which already includes the EU and Australia, the prevailing global carbon price falls from $22 per ton carbon dioxide (CO2) to $12/tCO2, due to the relatively lower abatement cost in China. Seventy-one percent of the EU’s and eighty-one percent of Australia’s domestic reduction burden would be transferred to China, increasing 0.03% of the EU’s and 0.06% of Australia’s welfare. The emission constraint improves the energy efficiency of China’s industry sector by 1.4%, reduces coal consumption by 3.3%, and increases clean energy by 3.5%.","[""abstract""]"

Presently, approximately 11,000 installations are covered by the ETS, with combined emissions equaling slightly more than 40% of all EU-wide emissions. From 2012, civil aviation will also be included under the cap, thereby expanding the system further [1]. The EU’s policy aim for ETS can be summarized as: to set a cap on emissions that is reduced over time (from 2013 and onwards the annual cap on emissions will be reduced annually by a linear factor of 1.74%), and to establish a market price for emissions creating incentives for firms to invest in climate-friendly technology and production methods. A major change from 2013 is that more allowances shall be auctioned rather than allocated to firms whereby the market will become more important in allocating allowances between participants [2]. According to the draft of the auctioning rules for the third trading period (2013–2020), the yearly supply of emission allowances will equal the annual cap [101]. The EU has thus chosen to fix the supply of emission allowances and to let the market decide the carbon price. An alternative system would be to set the price in advance and allow demand to determine the supply of allowances. Given that we know the demand function, it is possible to reach the same market equilibrium by fixing the supply as by fixing the price. Conversely, if demand is uncertain, supplying a given amount of allowances cannot guarantee a given price. Moreover, if demand is volatile over time, a fixed supply will create fluctuations in the price. Theoretically, there is an ongoing discussion comparing the advantages and disadvantages between a system of fixed supply with a system of fixed price [3,4]. No consensus has been reached within the literature on which of the two methods is preferable; the results depend on the model used to analyze the problem and the assumptions imposed. Proponents for fixing the price rather than the supply frequently argue that the price of carbon is an important signal to firms to invest in new technology and production methods. It is not the cap that directly sends such signals to individual firms, but the price. Large swings in the price thus reduce the price signal and make longterm planning for the firm more difficult [5]. Empirical papers have found that such fluctuations in prices may reduce investments as their profitability becomes more uncertain [6]. However, if the price fluctuations are small, this is likely to be less of a problem but if they are large it could reduce the efficiency of the ETS as a policy tool. In a worst case scenario, reductions in investments may make it difficult to meet the cap through technological advances, with the only alternative being to restrict production. The present economic crisis, which has swept over the world during the last couple of years, raises the issue of a frequently overlooked complication for the ETS; business cycle fluctuations and their effects on the carbon market. The cap set for the third trading period is based on long-term emission targets and the yearly reduction factor is derived from those targets. Demand for allowances is a function not just of long term GDP growth and productivity improvements but it also moves with “ Irrespective of how the problem is analyzed, understanding the link between prices and investments and how short-term shocks and business cycles affect demand for emission allowances is important. ” Fredrik NG Andersson† Business cycles and the European Union Emission Trading System","[""abstract""]"

Our analysis found that: 1) farmer ex ante preferences in general were biased against carbon sequestration participation although farmer involvement increased with carbon prices; 2) with the fertilizer industry exempted from cap-and-trade regulation, the production cost impact would be small, and more than half of the farms would gain with a carbon price possibly greater than $10 per metric ton of carbon; and 3) the production cost impact with a capped fertilizer industry would be 2 times higher, and more than half of the farms or farmland would lose unless the carbon price could reach more than $55 per metric ton of carbon.","[""abstract""]"

Now, the political discussion has moved ahead and carbon pricing – either being implemented in the form of CO2 taxes or tradable permit systems – is very high on the policy agenda, in particular as a consequence of the Stern report on the effects of climate change. Furthermore, carbon pricing is today regularly endorsed as an important policy instrument in the context of fiscal consolidation strategies and as a cornerstone in the transition to a green economy. The focus of this article is to shed light on the use of CO2 taxes following the experiences gained over the last 20 years since the first CO2 taxes have been implemented. The other policy measure in the context of carbon pricing is the EU ETS; however, ETS is still a rather new instrument, implying that the experience is rather limited, in particular when compared with the rich knowledge of CO2 taxes.","[""abstract""]"

Data on 324 types and site classes of softwood forests in southern and western states of the USA were used to examine the costs of extending rotations. The results were then aggregated by applying the marginal cost curves to inventory data within each county in these states. The results indicate that in these 12 states, about 15 million tCO2 could be sequestered for less than $7/tCO2 (1 tCO2 = 1,000 kg CO2), although for substantially higher carbon prices of $55/tCO2, up to 209 million tCO2 could be sequestered. Timber prices were found to have an important influence on the marginal costs of carbon sequestration, with site quality being of secondary importance.

The timing of sequestration is found to be sensitive to the assumed carbon price path. Low initial carbon prices ($10 - $20 per t C in 2010) followed by rapid price increases, as might occur if policy makers try to stabilize future concentrations, suggest little, if any, sequestration during the next 20 years (-0.2 to 4.5 Pg C). If policy makers develop policies that support higher initial carbon prices, ranging from $75 to $100 per t C, 17 to 23 Pg C could be sequestered in forests over the next 20 years.

The objective is to provide some quantitative socio-economic and environmental results to reveal the main challenges for EU in the framework of the ""socio-ecological transition"" without policy intervention and according to the global context. These results will also serve as references to assess the policies proposed to tackle the difficulties identified in this paper. Our results emphasise that none of the economic and employment objectives of the ""Europe 2020"" strategy while only few European environmental objectives will be reached in the event of a lack of policy responses to the SET. In particular, in one of the scenarios, the unfavourable European demographic and natural conditions do not allow for the release of the sovereign debt burden. The necessary fiscal consolidation induces then a weak economic growth and a high unemployment rate up to 2030. Thus, in that framework, investments enhancing the adaptation to the SET would not be possible. Besides, even in the more favourable scenario, the strong increase in high-skilled labour supply brings about a ""bottleneck effect"". The labour demand does not totally absorb this boom of high-skilled labour supply. Therefore, policies such as tackling innovation, research or competitiveness can facilitate to overcome employment and environmental difficulties. However, structural policies for resource efficiency and climate change (e.g. carbon price, energy-saving investments supports or rising of environmental standards) will also be necessary to smooth the path towards a successful socio-ecological transition.","[""abstract""]"

We also find evidence of fuel switching in electricity-generation in Germany after the collapse of the carbon market. Furthermore, the EU ETS has greatly contributed to the partial alignment of the wholesale price of electricity in France to that in Germany.","[""abstract""]"

The purpose of this article is to develop a framework for considering the case for, and effectiveness of, the wide range of existing and proposed complementary policies that are designed to accompany the carbon price in the effort to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. The article concludes that an effective evaluation of complementary policies should include identifying the market failure the policy is aimed at correcting. The complementary policy should work in conjunction with, not opposition to, other polices aimed at reducing emissions. It should be complementary with the policies of other levels of government and it should also consider issues of efficiency, equity, accountability and adaptability.","[""abstract""]"

The basic principles found in both the climate and trade regimes that promote differentiation of national efforts on the one hand, and non-discrimination of trade partners on the other hand, create a systematic conflict of using trade measures for promoting climate policy. Moreover, the way in which national emissions are accounted has implications for the use and usefulness of trade measures. The UN inventory system relates to the point of production, not consumption, following the ‘polluter pays’ principle. The question of whether this limits the scope for using border adjustments is examined. In combination with insights from partial equilibrium models, it is attractive for policy makers to focus their efforts on a few carbon-intensive industries. However, policy makers not only need to decide about the environmental integrity, the administration and the political credibility of border measures, but also consider that any such measure, even if it aims at supporting global emission reductions, could disrupt the international climate negotiations processes.","[""abstract""]"

The history of the early stage of carbon markets reveals a mixed record: the instrument diffused widely across the globe, while existing carbon markets performed rather slow, though anecdotal evidence suggests positive side effects on climate policymaking. Going forward, three key driving forces are likely to shape the future of emissions trading: (1) the source and sustainability of political demand for climate action in general and carbon markets in particular, (2) the governance of operating carbon markets including questions of bureaucratic capacity and regulatory capture, and (3) the pattern of market globalization, which encompasses issues of carbon price comparability, market linkage, and expansion. Depending on how these driving forces and fault lines play out, a number of scenarios are possible, ranging from strongly embedded and effective carbon markets to their collapse. The trajectory to any one of these scenarios could be characterized by tipping points, which are likely to come about incrementally.

A central tenet of economics is that the imposition of a border tax (a tariff) will always reduce global welfare. This holds even in the untypical case that a tariff increases the welfare of the country that imposes it. However, the existence of a global external effect like the one arising from GHG emissions overturns this rule. The imposition of an import tax on the CO2 content (including embedded carbon) of all goods imported into the EU from countries without carbon pricing or regulation would arguably reduce global carbon emissions and increase global welfare. The net effect of this action is to transfer, at least partially, carbon pricing across the globe. Border measures could be designed in a World Trade Organisation (WTO)-compatible way. The equity considerations enshrined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) could be addressed by rebating tax revenues according to the level of development. Analytical tools to establish responsibility and capability exist in the form of benchmarking and, more recently, commercial carbon foot-printing schemes.","[""abstract""]"

Long-term market coordination should be replaced by public coordination with long-term arrangements. The current market coordination makes carbon pricing ineffective in orienting investors towards capital-intensive low-carbon technologies. Fossil fuel generation technologies are preferred because their investment risks are much lower in the market regime, even with a high but unstable carbon price. Thus, in order to avoid delaying investment that is aimed at the decarbonization of the electricity system, a number of new market arrangements that lower the investment risk of low-carbon technologies and provide output-based subsidization have or are being selected by governments. As the use of low-carbon equipment to produce electricity develops, long-term market coordination for other technologies (e.g. peaking units, combined cycle gas turbine) will fade away because they alter the market price setting. Thus it is likely that, in the future, public coordination and planning will replace the decisions of market players not only for low-carbon technologies but also for every other type of capacity development. Policy relevance The development of renewables as promoted by both feed-in tariffs and green certificate obligations, which answer to different market failures, is well known. Similar long-term arrangements, which both subsidize and de-risk low-carbon investments for every small-sized and large-sized technology, shift learning costs and risks onto consumers. Energy experts and regulators have ignored that the expansion and generalization of these arrangements are changing the coordination function of the electricity markets. Apart from those in the UK, they are still unaware of the impacts that such technology-focused policies produce on the electricity market regime. The transition from market coordination to public coordination, which is inconsistent with the market principles of European electricity legislation, and long-term contracting is inevitable and should be anticipated.","[""abstract""]"

Certainly, a utopia situation to climate change would be shutting down all industrial units which is practically impossible task to do. This calls for other measures or alternatives to curb down the level of carbon emission. Various measures to lower down the carbon emission level has been proposed at national and international level, among them, two important being Cap and trade and Carbon tax. This paper discusses the concept of carbon tax, reviews experience implementing carbon tax in few countries and consideration in the design of carbon taxes. It also discusses the effectiveness of these policies and difficulties measuring impacts. Measure of effectiveness may vary by jurisdiction and specific policy goals. A carbon tax is a tax levied on the carbon content of fuels. It is a form of carbon pricing. Carbon taxes offer a potentially cost-effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Finland was the first country in the 1990s to introduce a CO2 tax, initially with few exemptions for specific fuels or sectors. Some countries use the carbon tax revenue for carbon mitigation programme. Other countries return carbon tax revenue to individuals. Sweden and Norway use carbon tax revenue to fund general government budget. Finland’s carbon tax also is directed to the general government budget, but it is accompanied by a cut in income tax.","[""abstract""]"

Building on the Court’s finding that FERC may regulate “practices” that “directly affect” rates in wholesale electricity markets, the analysis develops a detailed standard that is consistent with interpretation of regulatory statutes in each of three distinct eras: the Progressive Era, the era of regulation of utilities under firm-specific tariffs, and the modern, market-based era.

That analysis used lifetime costs to consider the merits of each technology. However, the lifetime cost analysis is less applicable in liberalised markets and does not look specifically at the viewpoint of the private investor. A follow-up NEA assessment of the competitiveness of nuclear energy against coal- and gas-fired generation under carbon pricing has considered just this question. The economic competition in electricity markets is today between nuclear energy and gas-fired power generation, with coal-fired power generation not being competitive as soon as even modest carbon pricing is introduced. Whether nuclear energy or natural gas comes out ahead in their competition depends on a number of assumptions, which, while all entirely reasonable, yield very different outcomes. The analysis in this study has been developed on the basis of daily data from European power markets over the last five-year period. Three different methodologies, a Profit Analysis looking at historic returns over the past five years, an Investment Analysis projecting the conditions of the past five years over themore » lifetime of plants and a Carbon Tax Analysis (differentiating the Investment Analysis for different carbon prices) look at the issue of competitiveness from different angles. They show that the competitiveness of nuclear energy depends on a number of variables which in different configurations determine whether electricity produced from nuclear power or from CCGTs generates higher profits for its investors. These are overnight costs, financing costs, gas prices, carbon prices, profit margins (or mark-ups), the amount of coal with carbon capture and electricity prices. This paper will present the outcomes of the analysis in the context of a liberalised electricity market, looking at the impact of the seven key variables and provide conclusions on the portfolio that a utility would be advised to maintain, given the need to limit risks but also to move to low carbon power generation.

This paper gives an overview of how these channels operate. Where applicable, drivers of policy cost are outlined to show how these policies may grow to represent a meaningful welfare impact. Through case study analyses, we explain the most common mechanisms through which these policy costs drive equity outcomes.

It is established in this article that carbon pricing need impose no burden at all, if the population is convinced of the merits of emission abatement and values are adjusted accordingly. However, values will not necessarily be adjusted. We impose the constraint of constant consumer values and perform a first-round analysis of the effects of abatement policies. The result of the analysis is that substantial reductions in CO2 emissions can be achieved without unreasonably high economic costs, provided governments are responsible in terms of macroeconomic management and flexible in terms of implementation mechanisms. The present article reports a comparison of abatement policies using a 'near Treasury' reference case. The near Treasury reference case replicates, as far as possible using NIEIR's models, the reference case used as a no-abatement policy case in the Treasury report 'Australia's Low Pollution Future' (2008). However, the near Treasury reference case that underlies the analysis is in several respects highly optimistic, particularly as regards the quality of Australian macroeconomic management. In addition, there are arguments that it is realistic to assume a considerably more pessimistic scenario. This will occur if the Australian economy is subject to a balance of payments constraint to growth. The implications of moving from the near Treasury reference case to the more realistic alternative reference case and the further implications of tightening the balance of payments constraint will be considered in a further article.","[""abstract""]"

An integrated market could help to improve security of supply, foster competition, and may also help to integrate renewables. After reviewing the literature and describing the context, three studies are reported as separate chapters, which besides the common underlying theme use novel econometric and statistical methodology for time series analysis. 
 
Chapter two examines electricity market integration in nine European spot markets between 2000 and 2013, and four forward markets between 2007 and 2012. In contrast to most previous studies, this study proposes that electricity price processes are time-varying, and assesses the potential impacts of special events. Spot prices are found to be fractionally integrated and mean-reverting processes whose parameters are time-dependent and associated with electricity market coupling initiatives or changes in interconnector capacity. Forward prices, in contrast, do not revert to the mean, and in general show more stable common long-run associations than electricity spot prices. 
 
Chapter three investigates the association between electricity market integration, fuel and carbon price developments during base and peak load hours from December 2005 to October 2013 for France, Nordpool and the UK. The local electricity mix and interconnection with adjacent markets are found to be associated with common price dynamics between electricity markets, as well as with electricity fuel and carbon prices. 
 
Chapter four studies the possible implications of Germany’s Nuclear Phase Out Act on the integration of EU’s electricity market. In 2011, Germany’s secure generating capacity decreased significantly after eight nuclear power plants were closed within a period of six months. The short-run interrelationships of electricity spot prices, from November 2009 to October 2012, with wind introduced by the German system, are modelled using multivariate generalised autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (MGARCH) models with dynamic correlations. In addition, a time-varying fractional cointegration analysis is conducted to identify any change in mean reversion and convergence of electricity spot prices. The results suggest unintended consequences from the policy: in the one-year period after the closures, the German market decoupled from the other markets and price volatility transmission increased.","[""abstract""]"

The results indicate that it requires substantially higher carbon price for early CCS diffusions.

It studies the use of policy combinations to mitigate greenhouse gases emissions from electricity production. One finding applies to cases where uncertainty is such that the risk of a nil carbon price cannot be excluded. A cap on emissions alone may then not trigger enough abatements, justifying the addition of e.g. a renewable subsidy. When considering a transition toward a carbon-free electricity sector, capital accumulation causes complex dynamic effects to happen. We find that decisions taken by comparing the levelized costs of abatement technologies, even including carbon costs, would favor intermediate technologies (e.g. gas plants) to the detriment of more-expensive but lower-carbon technologies (renewable power), leading to a suboptimal investment schedule. This thesis also studies the effects of marginal policy changes in a mix comprising the main French instruments. We find that surprisingly, adding a tariff for renewables financed by a tax on electricity consumption to a cap on emissions and a subsidy for energy efficiency will reduce the consumer electricity price when the non-renewable production is fixed and does not depend on the carbon price. The assessment of the French climate policies in the electricity sector shows that overlapping policies for mitigation may be justified by multiple carbon price failures, even if the ideal long-term policy mix depends on the carbon price trajectory.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

While there is no silver bullet that will provide sufficient abatement given the scale of the effort needed in this complex sector, a review of existing and emerging low-carbon solutions reveals a range of promising levies. Long ignored by carbon pricing mechanisms, the sector will certainly see its emissions abatement furthered by the growing number of carbon pricing initiatives targeted at it. This chapter outlines the global trends of greenhouse gas emissions in the road transport sector and suggests a segmented analysis for those emissions. It then reviews technological, organizational and behavioural solutions for emissions reduction in road transport. Finally, it assesses the potential impacts of economic instruments and other public policies related to carbon emissions reduction, giving a feedback on existing carbon pricing experience in road transport.","[""abstract""]"

We investigate this impact by simulating the impact of the supply of REDD units on the international carbon market in 2020 under unlimited and restricted exchange conditions. We find restricting supply or demand of REDD credits reduces such price impacts, but comes at the cost of economic efficiency. The introduction of deeper Annex I emissions reduction commitments reduces the impact on global carbon prices, but entails substantial compliance costs and wealth transfers. While REDD provides large economic benefits for tropical rainforest regions, any REDD fungibility scenario which results in a reduction in the international price of carbon also reduces transfers to the CDM host countries. Our modelling indicates unrestricted exchange of REDD units reduces the international carbon price by half and cuts Annex I compliance costs by roughly one third if projected emissions reduction commitments are unchanged. Alternatively, Annex I reduction commitments could be increased by around 60 percent at constant carbon prices. The findings of this research have relevance for policy makers and academics seeking to understand carbon market implications of supply variability and policymakers considering the introduction of REDD market mechanisms.","[""abstract""]"

The need for more electricity and the environmental concerns drive the focus towards the renewable energy sector.

This is especially true also for Latvia that, due to its limited domestic energy resources, is one of the most dependent countries on imported energy resources with the European Union. Domestic production of primary energy in Latvian accounts for 35 per cent of total production, with the remaining 65 per cent being imported. Furthermore, oil and gas-fuelled power stations count for more than 60 per cent of the total domestic production and hence representing the largest source of primary energy in Latvia and the gas and oil supplies are fully imported.","[""abstract""]"

As we account for investment costs of improving energy efficiency we find substantial welfare costs of energy efficiency policies, particularly when interacting with carbon pricing. Rebound effects within households are small, but economy-wide indirect rebound is significant because energy-intensive, trade-exposed (EITE) industries expand. As residential energy use consists mainly of carbon-free electricity, this expansion of EITE-industries leads to increased total CO2 emissions.","[""abstract""]"

New Haven, CT : Yale University Press .","2009","1","In A Question of Balance, Yale economics professor William Nordhaus empirically estimates the costs of climate change and the beneats of policy to lessen it. He uses a sophisticated computer model that integrates economic forecasts with climate prediction, and ands that doing nothing to lower carbon emissions will cost nearly three percent of global output by 2100. He recommends a policy costing a tenth of a percent (0.1 percent) of global output, in which governments institute an increasingly higher price on carbon. This carbon price would need to be adopted via a coordinated effort across countries and time. The arst chapter of the book summarizes the work in primarily non-jargon terms; later sections discuss how the model is developed and the equations on which it is based. In subsequent chapters, Nordhaus considers the costs and beneats of a number of alternative climate change policies, stresses the importance of globally-coordinated action, contemplates how to deal with uncertainty in predictions, and supports the institution of carbon taxes. Nordhaus’ estimates of costs of not curbing climate change are markedly lower than another recent estimate using similar methodology. The wellpublicized Stern Review predicts more dire consequences of doing nothing, costing up to 20 percent of global output.1 The difference between Stern’s and Nordhaus’ estimates lies in part with the choice of the discount rate. For those familiar with the argument in the economics literature surrounding the Stern Review’s use of a surprisingly low 1.4 percent discount rate, Nordhaus’ 4 percent may be more believable. In order to keep costs to only 0.1 percent of global output, Nordhaus proposes an (admittedly ambitious) “optimal” policy in which all countries agree to institute a carbon price that increases over time, starting from $27 per metric ton in 2005. In his model this policy would yield a 2.6°C increase in temperature between 1900 and 2100, compared to the 3.1°C scenario with no policy intervention. Nordhaus makes a strong case for putting a price on carbon. He supports the use of a tax to signal price, arguing that it is a more efacient market mechanism than subsidies would be. Taxes on carbon would provide signals to consumers so that they would have a price incentive to buy more environmentally146 • Book Reviews","[""abstract""]"

In particular, we model the tradeoff between investing in a renewable technology (such as wind) and a non-renewable technology (such as natural gas). The renewable technology has higher investment cost and is intermittent-that is, the supply of electricity from this technology is uncertain. The non-renewable technology is reliable and has a lower investment cost, but generation of electricity from this technology entails fuel expenditures as well as emission (carbon) costs. Motivated by existing electricity markets, we model several interrelated contexts, including: (a) vertically integrated electricity supplier, (b) market competition and (c) partial market competition with long-term fixed-price contracts for renewable electricity. Within these contexts we examine the impact of carbon taxes on the total cost and the share of wind capacity in the total capacity portfolio. We nd that intermittency is the critical aspect of renewable technologies which drives the effectiveness of carbon pricing mechanisms. Our results suggest that, due to intermittency of supply and the need for backup generating capacity, increasing the price of carbon emissions may have an unexpected adverse effect on investment in renewables. In addition, we show that market liberalization can have a negative effect on investment in renewable capacity, total cost and total emissions of the system. Fixed price contracts with renewable generators can mitigate these detrimental effects, but they may also lead to excess renewable capacity and insufficient non-renewable capacity in view of their complementary role as backup generators. We conclude that actions towards reducing the intermittency of the renewable energy sources (e.g., through capacity pooling or unit-specific buffering) may be more effective in promoting investment in renewable generation capacity than reliance on carbon taxes alone.","[""abstract""]"

It is argued here that carbon pricing is but one of a wide range of possible policy responses to excess greenhouse gas emissions. There are strong arguments for packaging these responses rather than relying on carbon pricing alone. A very wide range of policies is available to reduce emissions. In addition to emission abatement, some of the potential policies have other benefits. For example, policies to improve energy efficiency cut costs as well as emissions. We argue that Treasury's faith in the efficacy of market responses is not particularly well-founded. This being the case, if emission abatement is to be achieved at minimum cost it will be necessary to apply a wide range of complementary policies. Rather than simply presume on theoretical grounds that particular policies are applicable, we review the range.","[""abstract""]"

Moreover it features an investigation of input substitutability to provide modellers with adequate estimates for key elasticities as well as a discussion and amelioration of the standard base year calibration procedure of most CGE models. 
 
Building on these tools, the second part applies the improved modelling framework and studies the economic implications of environmental policy. This includes an analysis of so called rebound effects, which are triggered by energy efficiency improvements and reduce their net benefit, an investigation of how firms restructure their production processes in the presence of carbon pricing mechanisms, and an analysis of a regional maritime emission trading scheme as one of the possible options to reduce emissions of international shipping in the EU context.","[""abstract""]"

Two different but related major application types are addressed. First there are global-scale analyses that focus on calculating optimal global carbon emissions trajectories and carbon prices that maximize global welfare. The second application is the use of the same tools to compute the social cost of carbon (SCC) for use in US regulatory processes. The SCC is defined as the climate damages attributable to an increase of one metric ton of carbon dioxide emissions above a baseline emissions trajectory that assumes no new climate policies. The paper describes the three main quantitative models that have been used in the optimal carbon policy and SCC calculations and then summarizes the range of results that have been produced using them. The results span an extremely broad range (up to an order of magnitude) across modeling platforms as well as across the plausible ranges of input assumptions to a single model. This broad range of results sets the stage for a discussion of the five key challenges that face BCA practitioners participating in the national and global climate change policy analysis arenas: (1) including the possibility of catastrophic outcomes; (2) factoring in equity and income distribution considerations; (3) addressing intertemporal discounting and intergenerational equity; (4) projecting baseline demographics, technological change, and policies inside and outside the energy sector; and (5) characterizing the full set of uncertainties to be dealt with and designing a decision-making process that updates and adapts new scientific and economic information into that process in a timely and productive manner. The paper closes by describing how the BCA models have been useful in climate policy discussions to date despite the uncertainties that pervade the results that have been produced.","[""abstract""]"

The carbon price is imposed on top of any carbon cost that was already present in 2011. Full cost pass-through is assumed along the value chain. The paper finds that only a small number of industries – including the oil refinement, coal, iron and cement sectors – that account for around 2 per cent of UK GDP, are likely to face production cost increases that put them under pressure from competition abroad. It states that “carbon policies will provide incentives to increase energy efficiency and resource productivity which could afford UK producers a competitive advantage in the long term, in a world where fossil fuel prices could rise and carbon reduction policies are likely to become more widespread and ambitious.” The paper concludes that policies are needed to help sectors that emit high levels of greenhouse gases and are exposed the international trade – such as the cement, mining and petroleum refinement industries – adapt to changing economic conditions resulting from a uniform carbon tax.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Under the actual EU emission market segmentation, this overall emissions reduction target is split down into a 21% reduction in emissions from the sectors covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) and a 10% reduction in emissions from the non-ETS sectors, taking 2005 as the base year. Portugal, as an EU Member State, is subject to the EU climate-energy policy regulation and therefore is required to comply with country-specific emissions targets by 2020. In particular, Portugal may increase GHG emissions from the non-ETS sectors by 1% compared to 2005 levels by 2020, which must be reached with domestic policy measures. There is no national cap on emissions from the ETS sectors, although a 21% reduction must be achieved jointly across the 27 EU Member States by 2020. Thus, it is assumed that the EU ETS target applies to Portugal, i.e. Portugal should reduce emissions from the ETS sectors to 21% below 2005 levels by 2020. In this paper we intend to assess the impacts on the Portuguese economy when complying with this ambitious low-carbon strategy up to 2020. In our numerical simulations we employ a hybrid top-down/bottom-up modelling approach, which represents a reliable framework to analyse the economy-energy-environment interactions underlying carbon abatement policies. In particular, we make use of the Hybrid Bottom-up General Equilibrium Model (HybGEM) for Portugal – a multi-sector, CGE model integrating a bottom-up representation of the power sector, which has been designed for energy and climate mitigation policy assessment in a small open economy like Portugal. The HybGEM model is applied to simulate the economic, environmental and technological effects to achieve Portugal’s emissions targets for 2020, considering as policy instruments (1) the EU ETS with an economy-wide cap-and-trade system for emissions from energy-intensive sectors and (2) a domestic carbon tax for emissions from sectors outside the carbon trading (non-ETS sectors). The HyBGEM is numerically implemented as a system of simultaneous non-linear inequalities using the Mathematical Programming System for General Equilibrium analysis as a subsystem within the General Algebraic Modelling System – MPSGE/GAMS, and solved by using the PATH solver. Due to the preliminary nature of the results so far available, this abstract only presents the main simulated trends instead of quantitative outcomes which will be reported in the full paper. Preliminary results suggest that achieving the decarbonisation of the Portuguese economy considered in the simulated policy scenario leads to a contraction in output of energy (fossil-fuel) intensive sectors, reflecting the higher production costs associated with a non-zero carbon price. In the national power generation sector, there is an increased share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources as well as a diversification of the technology supply mix with carbon-free renewable power generation technologies (such as wind, biomass, and geothermal) replacing partly high-carbon fossil-fuels technologies (namely coal). The increased costs of electricity supply leads to a raise in electricity prices. In the new equilibrium, consumption is lower indicating the welfare cost of the transition towards a low-carbon economy. The real wage rate and the rental rate of capital fall below baseline levels.","[""abstract""]"

Market-based instruments could be pivotal in incentivizing cost-effective abatement. However, sector specificities in transaction costs, leakage risks and distributional impacts impede its implementation. The significance of such barriers critically hinges on the dimensions of policy design. This article synthesizes the work on emissions pricing in agriculture together with the literature on the design of market-based instruments. To structure the discussion, an options space is suggested to map policy options, focusing on three key dimensions of policy design. More specifically, it examines the role of policy coverage, instruments and transfers to farmers in overcoming the barriers. First, the results show that a significant proportion of agricultural emissions and mitigation potential could be covered by a policy targeting large farms and few emission sources, thereby reducing transaction costs. Second, whether an instrument is voluntary or mandatory influences distributional outcomes and leakage. Voluntary instruments can mitigate distributional concerns and leakage risks but can lead to subsidy lock-in and carbon price distortion. Third, the impact on transfers resulting from the interaction of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) with emissions pricing will play a key role in shaping political feasibility and has so far been underappreciated. POLICY RELEVANCE Following the 2015 Paris Agreement, European climate policy is at a crossroads. Achieving cost-effectively the 2030 and 2050 European targets requires all sectors to reduce their emissions. Yet, the cornerstone of European climate policy, the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), covers only about half of European emissions. Major sectors have been so far largely exempted from carbon pricing, in particular transport and agriculture. While transport has been increasingly under the spotlight as a possible candidate for an EU ETS sectoral expansion, policy discussions on pricing agricultural emissions have been virtually absent. This article attempts to fill this gap by investigating options for market-based instruments to reduce agricultural emissions while taking barriers to implementation into account.","[""abstract""]"

Scrapping of the carbon tax is politically beneficial to the unpopular government at the time, but the surviving climate agencies could haunt the government by continuing to provide evidence about climate change and the nation's increasing carbon emissions. It is unlikely other countries will follow Australia's action in going backwards on greenhouse gas emissions.

DIRECT ACTION is often perceived as an exercise in keeping up appearances: a fig-leaf policy from a government that has expressed little enthusiasm for serious action on climate change. But with the possible neutering of the Renewable Energy Target, Direct Action subsidies are set to be the main pillar of Australia’s climate change mitigation effort as well as a new drain on our scarce fiscal resources. The cornerstone of Direct Action is a system of subsidies for emissions-reducing projects, channelled through an Emissions Reduction Fund. In a nutshell, government will pay companies to implement specific projects that are thought to reduce emissions. It will “buy up the cost curve,” purchasing the lowest-cost emissions reductions first. Not much more detail is available about the policy than was sketched before the election. The government’s December 2013 green paper leaves many of the most crucial questions open, including how baselines would be set, whether there would be a penalty for companies that exceed their baselines, and whether projects in all parts of the economy would compete directly or there would be separate pots of money for sectors such as agriculture, forestry and industrial energy efficiency… Read the full article","[""abstract""]"

Beeson and Stone provided an interesting and useful discussion of how and when ‘policy entrepreneurs’ are able to make a decisive contribution to major policy reforms, and provided interesting perspectives on Garnaut’s role through the decades. Nonetheless, we consider that their argument and conclusion, that Garnaut failed to influence Australian climate policy, is deeply flawed. Instead, we consider that Garnaut has had a fundamental and durable impact on Australian climate policy, and a substantial influence on related political debate and lobbying. We offer these views as researchers deeply engaged in the economics of climate change and the design and assessment of climate-policy options. In 2008 one of us was an adviser to the Garnaut Review (Garnaut 2008a; 2011, referred to hereafter as ‘the Review’), and the other was a senior public servant who advised the government on its response to the Review. The first flaw in the arguments presented by Beeson and Stone is that they fail to identify the nature of the policy contribution of the Garnaut Review (Garnaut 2008a), and to locate this contribution in the ebb and flow of within Australian political debate on climate-change mitigation. The Review was commissioned in April 2007 by thenopposition leader Kevin Rudd and the premiers and chief ministers of the states and territories, around the same time as Prime Minister John Howard commissioned a report into emissions trading. The Prime Minister’s Task Group on Emissions Trading (PMTGET 2007) found that it was not in Australia’s interest to delay action until the emergence of a global consensus. Thus, both the government and the opposition went to the 2007 election proposing to introduce some form of carbon price, but without a near-term national emissions target. This reflected a fundamental reversal in the dominant view of both sides of politics over the previous decade that Australia’s primary national interest in international climate negotiations","[""abstract""]"

In this paper, we analyse the effect of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) on the geographical distribution of carbon emissions of multinational companies. The empirical evidence is based on unique data for the period 2007-2014 from the Carbon Disclosure Project, which tracks emissions of multinational businesses by geographical region. Because they already operate from multiple locations, multinational firms should be the most prone to carbon leakage. Our data includes regional emissions of 1,122 companies, of which 261 are subject to EU ETS regulation. We find no evidence that the EU ETS has led to a displacement of carbon emissions from Europe towards the rest of the world, including in countries with no climate policy in place and within energyintensive companies. A large number of robustness checks confirm this finding. Overall, the paper suggests that modest differences in carbon prices between countries do not induce carbon leakage.","[""abstract""]"

There is a broad consensus that such investments quickly pay for themselves in lower energy bills and spared emission allowances. However, investments that at first glance seem worthwhile are frequently not undertaken. Our aim is to shed some light on this issue. In particular, we try to assess these projects from a financial point of view so as to attract sufficient interest from the investment community. We consider the specific case of a firm or utility already in place that consumes huge amounts of coal and operates under restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions. In order to reduce both coal and carbon costs the firm may undertake an investment to enhance energy efficiency. We consider three sources of uncertainty: the fuel commodity price, the emission allowance price, and the overall investment cost. The parameters of the coal price process and the carbon price process are estimated from observed futures prices. The numerical parameter values are then used in a three-dimensional binomial lattice to assess the value of the option to invest. As usual, maximising this value involves determining the optimal exercise time. Thus we compute the trigger investment cost, i.e. the threshold level below which immediate investment would be optimal. A sensitivity analysis is also undertaken. Our results go some way towards explaining the so-called energy efficiency paradox.","[""abstract""]"

If countries use free allowance allocation as carbon leakage protection, only a fraction of carbon prices are passed through to consumers particularly by carbon intensive materials producers. Adding a consumption charge based on benchmarks applied to the material content can reinstate the carbon price signal. The paper investigates the implications of such a consumption charge for industry and consumers based on material flow analysis and material flow cost accounting. The material‐related carbon liabilities for production, import, export, and consumption are estimated for 4000 commodity groups that contain one or more of the five bulk materials steel, aluminium, plastics, paper, and cement. Assuming an underlying carbon price of 30 Euros per ton of CO2, the total charge to European final consumers is estimated to be about 17 billion EUR. The total charges levied on imports and those waived for exports are each of similar size and roughly amount to half of the total charge to European final consumers. To reduce administrative efforts, the charge is not levied on imported products for which the value of the consumption charge compared to product price falls below a threshold. Thus administrative efforts for 77 to 83% of imports could be avoided while still 85% to 90% of import‐related carbon liabilities are included.","[""abstract""]"

By offsetting these distortions, carbon pricing may generate significant net economic benefits, so it is in countries own interests to implement carbon pricing unilaterally rather than waiting for others to act. Net benefits are further enhanced if carbon pricing is revenue neutral and broader taxes cause substantial avoidance and evasion. Flexible international pricing regimes, allowing countries with high domestic environmental benefits or fiscal needs to set higher carbon prices, are more efficient than globally uniform carbon prices.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Renewable technology has a higher investment cost and yields only an intermittent supply of electricity; nonrenewable technology is reliable and has lower investment cost but entails both fuel expenditures and carbon emission costs. With reference to existing electricity markets, we model several interrelated contexts|the vertically integrated electricity supplier, market competition, and partial market competition with long-term fixed-price contracts for renewable electricity|and examine the effect of carbon taxes on the cost and share of wind capacity in an energy portfolio. We find that the intermittency of renewable technologies drives the effectiveness of carbon pricing mechanisms, which suggests that charging more for emissions could unexpectedly discourage investment in renewables. We also show that market liberalization may reduce investment in renewable capacity while increasing the overall system's cost and emissions. Fixed-price contracts with renewable generators can mitigate these detrimental effects, but not without possibly creating other problems. In short: actions to reduce the intermittency of renewable sources may be more effective than carbon taxes alone at promoting investment in renewable generation capacity.","[""abstract""]"

For the final negotiations on phase 3 of the EU Emissions Trading System we propose contributions on three issues: 1. operational procedures for dealing with carbon leakage and competitiveness in all sectors that provide criteria for allocating free allowances: 2. empowering the carbon market by extending the task of the emissions allowances issuing carbon authority to control the liquidity of the carbon market in view of stabilising the carbon price; 3. designing the auctioning mechanism by considering timing and auctioning as a strategic instrument for enhancing the carbon market and considering unified auc-tioning with revenues split among EU countries.

Worldwide emissions of greenhouse gases need to fall to zero by 2100. Action needs to be even faster in the case of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is primarily released in the burning of fossil fuels. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), global CO2 emissions need to reach zero by 2070 at the latest. In other words, the global economy needs to be completely ""decarbonised"" by then. The sustainable development goals (SDGs) of Agenda 2030 underscore the significance of this task.The decarbonisation of our economic activity is dependent not only on the international climate regime, but also the regulatory framework for the world economy, i.e. global economic governance.In addition to progress made in the context of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the fundamental acknowledgment of all states of the need to tackle climate change in the scope of Agenda 2030 there are currently numerous initiatives that give cause for optimism – not least the commitment of the G7 states to the decarbonisation of the global economy and manifold climate actions of actors such as cities, churches and companies.However, further reaching reforms of global economic framework conditions are necessary if a fundamental transformation is to be achieved. We therefore propose 3x3 starting points: 3 areas of action, each with 3 key aspects. Of particular importance for the decarbonisation of the global economy are (A) adequate pricing, (B) a suitable body of regulations for international trade and investment and (C) the appropriate configuration of the financial markets. (A) To achieve correct pricing it is necessary to (i) introduce a global carbon price, (ii) continue to remove subsidies for fossil fuels, and (iii) extend the system of payments for ecosystem services. (B) A suitable regulatory framework for international trade and investment includes (i) climate-friendly multilateral trade rules under the aegis of the World Trade Organization (WTO), (ii) the promotion of plurilateral agreements for the liberalisation of environmental goods and services and (iii) increased focus on the right to regulate in terms of environmental aspects in bilateral and regional trade and investment agreements. (C) In addition to the establishment of global funds such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the area of global financial governance has three starting points in particular: (i) regulation of financial markets, (ii) green guidelines for investment decisions and (iii) guarantee instruments for green investments.For all reform measures there is a need to identify potential win-win constellations that offer co-benefits to as many participants as possible. In addition, attention should also be paid to trade-offs and political economy. This includes the question of which actors are in favour of the necessary measures, which resist them and why and how coalitions of change can be formed and reinforced.","[""abstract""]"

Many government agencies seek to reduce the environmental and social ills associated with excess travel demand (e.g. congestion, reduced safety during travel, local pollution and noise, energy consumption, and climate change). These agencies have many tools at their disposal to reduce vehicle miles traveled (VMT) per capita including encouraging compact mixed-use development, providing alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel such as transit and biking and walking infrastructure, and restricting/regulating driving alone for instance by providing less parking. But the fastest way to reduce travel demand is through higher pricing that accounts for the externalities that drivers impose upon each other and society more broadly. The degree to which higher pricing can reduce travel demand is a function of two interrelated factors: 1) how high of a price increase is politically feasible to implement, and 2) the degree to which the driving public responds to the higher cost of driving. Both these factors vary over time. Given that carbon pricing and/or higher gas taxes are likely to take years to gain broader political acceptability, thefuture price elasticities of travel demand are just as relevant as today's elasticities. Therefore, this thesis focuses on the variability of price elasticity, the factors that explain this variation, and how these factors might change in the future. Using a diverse set of methods including literature review, semi-structured interviews, and odometer data, I find evidence that the magnitude of price elasticity is lower for vehicles of higher fuel economy, for vehicles further from the urban center, and for vehicles in lower income zipcodes. This is the first analysis I am aware of that evaluates the variation of the price elasticity of travel demand within a metro area, an approach that is important to the understanding the political feasibility of pricing and as a lens to the future effectiveness of pricing. It suggests that gas price increases will affect certain households in very different ways, with the most inelastic households simply paying more to maintain their lifestyle and the most elastic households pushed to make significant changes to their daily travel patterns and opportunities. These two types of impact may lead to different types of resistance to the policy. As for the future, the findings regarding fuel economy and distance to the urban center are particularly relevant, as we foresee society continues to become more metropolitan and the vehicle fleet is increasingly comprised of high fuel economy vehicles. Finally, the magnitude of price response suggested by both my interviews and my odometer data analysis suggests that price is still a significant determining factor in distance driven; therefore, policy that increases the cost of driving remains an important emissions reduction strategy.

It is written with emphasis on the contemporary moment for climate change policy based on the assertion that the Environmental Protection Agency’s impending authority over greenhouse gas emissions has made national climate action as close to inevitable as it has ever been. In recent years, the consensus within the climate policy community has shifted away from cap-and-trade in favor of a carbon tax for its simplicity and efficiency. Yet despite its transparency, concerns about a carbon tax perpetuate, including: that the tax would be regressive and harm the poor, that it would be costly and harm the economy, that “big oil” would fight any climate policy, and that the American right is committed to inaction on climate change. Some of these concerns are overstated, others simply lack empirical support. This thesis aims to clarify what a carbon tax would actually look like, provide an account of how carbon pricing is actually understood among those who would ultimately design such a policy, and in so doing present an image of a modern climate change politics which has caught up with scientific and economic consensus – or close enough.","[""abstract""]"

Using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model of China, this study analyzes the economic and greenhouse gas impacts of meeting those targets through carbon pricing. The study finds that the trajectory of carbon prices to achieve the target depends on several factors, including how the carbon price changes over time and how carbon revenue is recycled to the economy. The study finds that carbon pricing that starts at a lower rate and gradually rises until it achieves the intensity target would be more efficient than a carbon price that remains constant over time. Using carbon revenue to cut existing distortionary taxes reduces the impact on the growth of gross domestic product relative to lump-sum redistribution. Recycling carbon revenue through subsidies to renewables and other low-carbon energy sources also can meet the targets, but the impact on the growth of gross domestic product is larger than with the other policies considered.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

The new economy of climate change departs from the standard approach with regard to its economic instruments (emissions prices and quotas), returning to a classical political economy approach in terms of production economics. It confers a strategic role on methods and techniques for cutting emissions, as part of a long-term vision of energy and industrial transition. It is underpinned by the concerted action of States and multiple actors operating on various scales.

They need to be reduced, and this could be difficult under nationally based climate policy approaches. We compare a new set of nationally based modelling (the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project) with best practice and technical limit benchmarks for iron and steel and cement emissions. We find that 2050 emissions from iron and steel and cement production represent an average 0.28 tCO2 per capita in nationally based modelling results, very close to the technical limit benchmark of 0.21 tCO2 per capita, and over 2.5 times lower than the best practice benchmark of 0.72 tCO2 per capita. This suggests that national projections may be overly optimistic about achievable emissions reductions in the absence of global carbon pricing and an international research and development effort to develop low emissions technologies for emissions-intensive products. We also find that equal per capita emissions targets, often the basis of proposals for how global emissions budgets should be allocated, would be inadequate without global emissions trading. These results show that a nationally based global climate policy framework, as has been confirmed in the Paris Agreement, could lead to risks of overshooting global emissions targets for some countries and carbon leakage. Tailored approaches such as border taxes, sectoral emissions trading or carbon taxes, and consumption-based carbon pricing can help, but each faces difficulties. Ultimately, global efforts are needed to improve technology and material efficiency in emissions-intensive commodities manufacturing and use. Those efforts could be supported by technology standards and a globally coordinated R&D effort, and strengthened by the adoption of global emissions budgets for emissions-intensive traded goods.

Considering the macroeconomic loss and emission effects,the paper identifies the optimal carbon price and reasonable carbon price intervals under different scenarios. It is most reasonable to introduce carbon market under the scenario of 10% carbon abatement target,which can accept heavier price shock(6. 9- 35 /tC) with less economic loss. Referring to decomposition factors of the Kaya equation,the carbon emission reduction effect caused by carbon price is mainly from the macro energy intensity effect and technical progress effect.Introducing carbon price will not only reduce energy consumption but induce a low-carbon energy consumption structure,especially the coal consumption decreased significantly.(2) At the industrial sector level,outputs of all sectors,especially energy sector,will drop,while industrial structure stays unchanged to some extent. The main impact on energy consumption is that the introduction of the carbon price has great effects on the energy sector and the transport sector. Each sector's unit cost of aggregated energy utilization is divided into two parts,the energy own price and cost of carbon emissions. The paper concludes that the unit cost of aggregated energy utilization's change is mainly caused by the cost of carbon emissions. Further,carbon emissions costs of energy intensive sectors are higher,while the reduction rate is relatively high,but the reduction effect is still not significant. The paper recomands implementing the incentive policy such as energy resources tax and transportation fuel tax which will maintain the necessary level of energy prices,and promoting emission reduction in the fields of coal and transportation.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

International emissions trading can help to reduce the overall cost of mitigation and ensure that companies in different countries face the same carbon price. Lower costs and tackling competitiveness concerns can enable higher levels of climate ambition. The Paris Agreement explicitly provides for international emissions trading, but the rules governing trading still need to be determined. In the absence of strict rules, international emissions trading might become a loophole leading to reduced climate ambition. And because of its consensus requirements, the United Nations process is unlikely to lead to comprehensive rules. To fill this gap, the European Union should engage with other nations to determine a set of rules that can serve as a gold standard for emissions trading anywhere in the world. Policy challenge The effort to define rules for international emissions trading faces the strong desire of nation states to develop their own climate policies, which collides with the need for tradable units in one country to be equivalent to tradable units in another country. To overcome this dilemma we propose a club of carbon-buying countries that would regulate only imported mitigation outcomes. We propose that private parties would be able, if permitted by the participating governments, to transfer any type of privately tradable emissions reduction unit across borders. But they would also be liable if the foreign units do not represent sufficient mitigation in the selling county. To bridge the period before final settlement, private parties would be able to borrow domestic compliance units, based on collateralising a certain amount of foreign units.","[""abstract""]"

Global 4C offers a financial reward for mitigation and aims to internalise a Risk Cost of Carbon (RCC) into the economy. Carbon taxes (i.e. carbon prices) are essential for internalising the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC), however a SCC-RCC duality is inferred with an epistemological method and is supported with a new hypothesis, called the Holistic Market Hypothesis. Based on the inferred SCC-RCC duality, a system of complementary market pricing is proposed as an effective response to emerging climate systemic risk and fat-tailed probability distributions for the Earth's climate sensitivity. The recommended policy instrument is a currency, called Complementary Currencies for Climate Change (4C). 4C should be priced in foreign exchange currency markets (Forex) to mirror the RCC and to incentivise a spectrum of mitigation services, including clean renewable energy and carbon sequestration. A public broadcast message for climate systemic risk should be made each year, in the form of a ‘100-year advance 4C price alert’, which is an assurance of reward prices for carbon mitigation (i.e. the 4C exchange rate) under a Carbon Exchange Standard (CES). The CES is a macro-prudential protocol for central banks to provide collective insurability against climate catastrophe and incentives for socio-ecological co-benefits.","[""abstract""]"

The carbon price threshold in France perfectly coincides with the well-known carbon spot price structural break occurred on October 2008. This is not the case for the carbon price threshold in Germany. An in-depth analysis reveals that during the period before October 2008, carbon prices were not reflected in electricity prices in either countries. This is mainly due to uncertainties about the future of the EU ETS that have led electricity producers to adopt a wait and see behavior. After October 2008, French electricity producers passthrough the price of emission permits into electricity prices in a linear way, while their German counterparts do so nonlinearly.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Kazakhstan has taken a leadership role in the Central Asian region in terms of climate change policies and greener economy. Kazakhstan has ratified Kyoto Protocol in 2009. Kazakhstan has committed to reduce emissions by 15% below 1992 GHG levels by year 2020. In 2013 by decree of President of Kazakhstan a concept of Green Growth was adopted. Environmental regulations in Kazakhstan inherited from the planned economy need to be modified to correspond to current economic situation and climate change goals. Carbon tax and emissions trading are two of the main instruments to curb GHG emissions. There is an ongoing debate regarding which policy instrument is the most optimal towards reduction of emissions. The main difference between the two instruments are levels of uncertainty with regards to the carbon price and thus emissions reductions. Carbon tax provides more carbon price certainty, while emissions trading carbon prices are more volatile. Carbon tax mechanism is more easily to implement and operate, than ETS. Kazakhstan has opted and implemented emissions trading scheme in January 2013.. The ETS covers 55% of total CO2 emissions in Kazakhstan, and includes energy, mining and chemical industry. The average price of allowances was KZT 406 (US$2). Carbon tax in Kazakhstan would provide stability of carbon price, moreover carbon tax is easier to implement and monitor. The objective of this paper is using computable general equilibrium (CGE) model evaluate macroeconomic and environmental impacts of different carbon tax levels in Kazakhstan. Standard multiregion, multisector static CGE model, GTAP is used to simulate the impact of different carbon tax levels in Kazakhstan. GTAP is a standard CGE model based on assumptions of perfect competition and constant returns to scale. GTAP data base with latest version 9 is used in this study. The base year of the data base is 2010. The data base for the purpose of this study is aggregated to 11 sectors, out of which six are energy sectors, and six regions. Six regions are Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, China, EU and Rest of the World. Three sets of scenarios are simulated where carbon tax is priced at US$5, US$10 and US$20 per tCO2. Carbon tax is implemented in the CGE model as ad valorem equivalents. Carbon tax is implemented for all energy sectors and chemicals and heavy manufacturing sectors. Initial findings show macroeconomic effects of carbon tax in Kazakhstan. Preliminary findings allow to identify sectors which would benefit or loss from the implementation of carbon tax in Kazakhstan. It is expected that in all scenarios CO2 emissions will reduce, though magnitude of CO2 emissions reductions is expected to differ.","[""abstract""]"

However, the viability and economic consequences of large-scale BECCS deployment are not fully understood. We use the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) integrated assessment model to explore the potential global and regional economic impacts of BECCS. As a negative-emissions technology, BECCS would entail a net subsidy in a policy environment in which carbon emissions are taxed. We show that by mid-century, in a world committed to limiting climate change to 2 °C, carbon tax revenues have peaked and are rapidly approaching the point where climate mitigation is a net burden on general tax revenues. Assuming that the required policy instruments are available to support BECCS deployment, we consider its effects on global trade patterns of fossil fuels, biomass, and agricultural products. We find that in a world committed to limiting climate change to 2 °C, the absence of CCS harms fossil-fuel exporting regions, while the presence of CCS, and BECCS in particular, allows greater continued use and export of fossil fuels. We also explore the relationship between carbon prices, food-crop prices and use of BECCS. We show that the carbon price and biomass and food crop prices are directly related. We also show that BECCS reduces the upward pressure on food crop prices by lowering carbon prices and lowering the total biomass demand in climate change mitigation scenarios. All of this notwithstanding, many challenges, both technical and institutional, remain to be addressed before BECCS can be deployed at scale.","[""abstract""]"

Market-based instruments could be pivotal in incentivizing cost-effective abatement. However, sector specificities in transaction costs, leakage risks and distributional impacts impede its implementation. The significance of such barriers critically hinges on the dimensions of policy design. This article synthesizes the work on emissions pricing in agriculture together with the rich literature on the design of market-based instruments. To structure the discussion, a nexus is suggested to map policy options, focusing on three key dimensions of policy design. More specifically, it examines the role of policy coverage, instruments and transfers to farmers in overcoming the barriers. First, the results show that a large proportion of agricultural emissions and mitigation potential could be covered by a policy targeting large farms and few emission sources, thereby reducing transaction costs. Second, whether an instrument is voluntary or mandatory influences distributional outcomes and leakage. Voluntary instruments can mitigate distributional concerns and leakage risks but can lead to subsidy lock-in and carbon price distortion. Third, the impact on transfers resulting from the interaction of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) with emissions pricing will play a key role in shaping political feasibility and has so far been underappreciated.","[""abstract""]"

The overarching goal of this dissertation, which is comprised of three interrelated studies, is to analyze and compare energy futures scenarios to achieve a renewable energy transition and low-carbon economy in the State of Vermont. In the first study, an analysis is presented of the role of energy pricing regimes and economic policy in the context of pursuing a renewable energy transition in the State of Vermont. Through the development and application of a system dynamics model, results address the limits to technological substitution due to path dependence on nonrenewable energy. The role of complementary economic policy is also highlighted to shift from a goal of quantitative growth to qualitative development in order to decouple economic welfare from energy consumption. In the second study, an analysis is presented of the impact of modeled energy transition scenarios to address energy development and land use trade-offs. Simulations with a spatio-temporal land cover change model find that Vermont could achieve a complete transition to renewable electricity using in-state resources through developing between 11,000 and 100,000 hectares of land for solar and wind, or up to four percent of state land area, including some environmentally sensitive land. This approach highlights the need for integration of energy policy and land use planning in order to mitigate potential energy-land use conflict. In the final study, trade-offs between energy, economic, environmental, and social dimensions of Vermont’s renewable energy transition are explored through the use of a multi-criteria decision analysis. Energy transition alternatives were designed to reveal trade-offs at the intersection of economic growth and carbon price policy. While there were no optimal pathways to achieving Vermont’s energy transition, some energy transition alternatives achieve a more socially desirable balance of benefits and consequences. Navigating the trade-offs inherent in the ongoing energy transition will require an adaptive approach to policymaking that incorporates iterative planning, experimentation, and learning.","[""abstract""]"

To correct the environmental distortion embedded in Adam Smith’s model the only thing that needed to be done was to internalize the cost of being environmentally friendly in the pricing mechanism of traditional markets to shift them to green markets, green producers and green consumers, but instead they went the way of environmental externality management (e.g. carbon pricing) as they took the environmental distortion embedded in Adam Smith’s model as an environmental externality led market failure. Hence, instead of correcting Adam Smith’s model to eliminate the environmental distortion by reflecting environmental costs in the pricing mechanism and making that way environmental issues endogenous issues as they should have been from the beginning had Adam Smith proposed green markets instead of the traditional market they are treating an embedding distortion in Adam Smith’s model that before was irrelevant, but now it is relevant, as an environmental externality led market failure. And this raises the question: Is environmental externality management a correction of Adam Smith’s model to make it environmentally friendly and shift it to green markets or is it a distortion on top of another distortion? Among the goals of this paper are: a) to show analytically and graphically that the proper correction of Adam Smith’s model to eliminate the embedded environmental distortion in it and shift it to green markets is environmental cost internalization; and b) to point out analytically and graphically that environmental externality management is a distortion on top of an embedded environmental distortion in Adam Smith’s model; and therefore it is unconnected to perfect green market thinking.","[""abstract""]"

Over the last six years, however, policymakers in Australia, California, China, Japan, and Korea implemented carbon prices that regulate the consumption of carbon emissions, where points of compliance are further downstream, such as distributors or final consumers. This article aims to describe the design of these prices on carbon consumption, understand and explain the motivations of policymakers who have implemented them, and identify insights for policymakers considering whether to price carbon consumption. We find a clear trend of policymakers layering prices on carbon consumption on top of prices on carbon production in an effort to improve economic efficiency by facilitating additional downstream abatement. In these cases, prices on carbon consumption are used to overcome a shortcoming in the price on carbon production: incomplete pass-through of the carbon price from producers to consumers. We also find that some policymakers implement prices on carbon in an effort to reduce emissions leakage or because large producers of carbon are not within jurisdiction. Because policymakers are starting to view prices on carbon consumption as a strategy to improve economic efficiency and reduce emissions leakage in a way that is compatible with local and international law, we expect jurisdictions will increasingly implement and rely upon them.","[""abstract""]"

Design/methodology/approach - A case study was undertaken drawing upon interviews that were undertaken between 2008 and 2011 at the industry and organizational levels as well as documentary evidence relating to carbon accounting policy development at the macro, or policy level. Findings - The parliamentary committee hearings into the development of the carbon price legislation represented fields of position-practice relationships which highlighted the interplay of the internal structures, capabilities and the roles of both power and trust of the agent(s)-in-focus. A meso level analysis of the Victorian water industry highlighted how it was able to mediate the exercise of power by the macro level through the early adoption of carbon accounting frameworks. At the ontic or micro level of the individual water business, the development of a greenhouse strategy was also the outcome of position-practice relationships which highlighted the interplay of the internal structures and dispositions of the agent(s)-in-focus. The position-practice relationships at both the industry and organizational level were characterized by both soft power and trust. Research limitations/implications - Future research could investigate how the withdrawal of the carbon pricing mechanism in Australia has affected the development of carbon accounting practices whilst overseas research could examine the extent to which carbon accounting frameworks were the outcome of position-practice relationships. Practical implications - Given the global significance of carbon accounting, this paper provides an overview as to how the early adoption of voluntary carbon accounting practices resulted in a reduction in carbon emissions within the water industry and therefore limited its liability for the carbon price.

The willingness to provide international finance in accordance with common but differentiated responsibilities was acknowledged by the broad endorsement of the Paris Agreement, and the Green Climate Funds in particular. The international community aims to mobilize at least USD 100 billion per year for mitigation and adaption in developing countries. In this article, we argue that too little attention has been paid on the spending side of climate finance, both in the political as well as the academic debate. To this end, we review the challenges encountered in project‐based approaches of allocating climate finance in the past. In contrast to project‐based finance, we find many advantages to spending climate finance in support of price‐based national policies. First, the support for international climate cooperation is improved when efforts of successively rising domestic carbon pricing levels are compensated. Second, carbon pricing sets incentives for least‐cost mitigation. Third, investing domestic revenues from emission pricing schemes could advance a country's individual development goals and ensure the recipient's ‘ownership’ of climate policies. We conclude that by reconciling the global goal of cost‐efficient mitigation with national policy priorities, climate finance for carbon pricing could become a central pillar of sustainable development and promote international cooperation to achieve the climate targets laid down in the Paris Agreement.

Within conservative and libertarian circles, some proponents claim that a revenue-neutral carbon tax “swap” could deliver a double dividend, reducing climate change while shifting some of the nation’s tax burden onto carbon emissions, which supposedly would spur the economy.This analysis describes several serious problems with those claims. The actual economics of climate change — as summarized in the peer-reviewed literature as well as United Nations (UN) and Obama administration reports — reveal that the case for a U.S. carbon tax is weaker than the carbon tax proponents claim.Future economic damages from carbon dioxide emissions can only be estimated in conjunction with forecasts of climate change. But recent history shows those forecasts are in flux, with an increasing number of forecasts of less warming appearing in the scientific literature in the last four years. Additionally, we show some rather stark evidence that the family of models used by the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is experiencing a profound failure that greatly reduces their forecast utility.If the case for emission cutbacks is weaker than the public has been led to believe, the claim of a double dividend is on even shakier ground. There really is a consensus in this literature, and it is that carbon taxes cause more economic damage than generic taxes do on labor or capital, so that in general even a revenue-neutral carbon tax swap would probably reduce economic growth.","[""abstract""]"

Acknowledging that the pursuit of a world unique carbon price approach, or the so-called “burden sharing” approach leads to a diplomatic impasse (Hourcade et al., 2008; Shukla and Dhar, 2011), a new role has been given to project-based climate finance. The objective is to bring the banking system and institutional investors in the funding of the low-carbon transition in order to scale up climate finance. On the one hand this paradigm shift happens in an untimely context of private deleveraging in the aftermath of the great recession and public distrust in the ability and the willingness of the financial system to make a sustainable recovery possible. On the other hand, this context opens a window of opportunity to link the low-carbon transition funding challenge with the reform of the financial and monetary order to make it more resilient. In this paper, we build on Hourcade et al. (2012) to present a plan to scale up climate finance and overcome the stumbling blocks of climate negotiations. This plan starts from the diagnosis that: (1) the urgency of strong action for the energy transition and against climate risks is widely admitted; (2) constrained public budgets in developed countries since the beginning of the great recession seem to forbid any ambitious financing plan, neither domestic or abroad; (3) energy-intensive emerging economies disagree on any binding policy that would limit their development pace; (4) in that context, the focus of climate negotiations on a “carbon price only” mechanism, be it through a carbon tax or an emission cap, has come accross an inextricable distributive issue. Any new roadmap for successful post-Kyoto negotiations must thus take into consideration this bundle of constraints. The basic principle of the solution we propose is the use of a new financial vehicle to fund Low-Carbon Projects.

There could be large consequences for aggregate production costs if (i) the new technology is producing at a higher cost compared to the existing technologies in the power system; (ii) existing technologies cannot be phased-out at a similar pace as the new technology is phased in, leading to over-capacity in the power system; and (iii), the requirements of the existing power system to meet certain types of electricity demand change. These are all important questions to address when countries decide to move towards new technologies for generating electricity. Leading examples include introducing renewable energy sources like wind or the substitution of conventional energy sources like natural gas instead of coal. The main objective of this project is to study the costs of generating electricity in the Danish power system. Specifically, calculating and then comparing the costs of generating electricity across different types of generating technologies provides an opportunity to measure the trade-offs involved when new technologies are introduced into a power system. By investigating the case of Denmark, this study provides important new insights into the aggregate costs of generating electricity. Specifically, the actual average unit costs are estimated for the full generating capacity in the Danish power system. Denmark is a particularly interesting case to study because it is a world leader in terms of wind power penetration rates. In 2012, the wind power penetration rate in electricity consumption was equal to 30 percent, whereas it was equal to 34 percent for production, see International Energy Agency (2013). For comparisons, other regions are dwarfed by the Danish rates: the corresponding values were six percent for Europe, 3.5 percent for the US, two percent for China, and 2.5 percent for the world. The countries that are closest to Denmark in terms of wind power penetration rates are Portugal with 20 percent and Spain with 18 percent. Important lessons can be learned about the consequences of the relative rapid introduction of a large degree of wind power on the electricity generating system. In addition, studying wind power in Denmark is also interesting because the penetration rate increased over a short period of time. In 1985, the share of wind generating capacity was essentially equal to zero. By 2012, the penetration rate of wind power in electricity consumption had increased to 30 percent. In this paper, we calculate the levelised costs for nine different classes of generators and provide a technical comparison across 7 thermal electricity generating technologies and 4 renewable generation technologies. The 7 thermal electricity generating technologies consist of (1) condensing generators, (2) back-pressure generators, (3) extraction generators, (4) combined heat-and-power (CHP) waste generators, (5) combined-cycle gas turbines, (6) single-cycle gas turbines, and (7) gas engines. The two renewable generation technologies are onshore and offshore wind turbines. We also provide a breis analysis of hydro and solar generation. For all nine technologies we present detailed costs calculations for computing the levelised costs. The major cost components are which are capital costs, operation and maintenance costs, fuel costs, and emission costs. In chapter 2, we present detailed cost calculations for the seven thermal technologies, whereas in chapter 3 we present the results for non-thermal generation in Denmark. The results reported in this paper are used as inputs in the analysis of the aggregate costs of generating electricity in Denmark reported in Levitt and Sorensen (2014).

Such models typically project an initially low carbon price that increases with time. This framework does not reflect the incentives of decision makers who are responsible for generating tax revenue. If a rising carbon price is to result in near-zero emissions, it must ultimately result in near-zero carbon tax revenue. That means that at some point, policy makers will be asked to increase the tax rate on carbon emissions to such an extent that carbon tax revenue will fall. Therefore, there is a risk that the use of a carbon tax to generate revenue could eventually create a perverse incentive to continue carbon emissions in order to provide a continued stream of carbon tax revenue. Using the Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy (DICE) model, we provide evidence that this risk is not a concern for the immediate future but that a revenue-generating carbon tax could create this perverse incentive as time goes on. This incentive becomes perverse at about year 2085 under the default configuration of DICE, but the timing depends on a range of factors including the cost of climate damages and the cost of decarbonizing the global energy system. While our study is based on a schematic model, it highlights the importance of considering a broader spectrum of incentives in studies using more comprehensive integrated assessment models. Our study demonstrates that the use of a carbon tax for revenue generation could potentially motivate implementation of such a tax today, but this source of revenue generation risks motivating continued carbon emissions far into the future.","[""abstract""]"

Through an investigation of Australia's complex, and ultimately brief, carbon pricing scheme, we find that policy uncertainty forces organizations to focus their responses on short-term investments and dealing with that very uncertainty, thereby precluding the development of green capabilities and preventing flexible regulations from achieving their intended policy results. However, we also find that organizations are able to develop innovative regulatory coping capabilities and that variation in regulatory response results in a variation in these capabilities.","[""abstract""]"

This signalled a collective commitment to aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently to limit global warming to two degrees C. While the Paris Agreement was celebrated as a political milestone, efforts to ensure the implications of climate change are integrated by the financial sector, particularly the many trillions of dollars managed by bankers, investors and asset managers, continue. The importance of financial decisions is evident from the reality that to a large degree they either make the problem worse (e.g., by continuing to increase fossil fuel exploration, production, and utilization) or support solutions (e.g., by investing in clean energy and climate resilience). Fortunately, the financial sector is waking up to climate change – first and foremost because, as recent experience shows, the impact of extreme weather events can have devastating financial as well as human impacts, thus resulting in increased awareness of “climate risks,” and initial efforts to incorporate these considerations into financial decision-making. These shifts in the policy landscape (as evidenced most clearly by the Paris Agreement, but also by green policy initiatives in some countries such as China, Brazil, Bangladesh and the UK) signify not just political consensus, but also growing momentum for action at the nexus of climate change policy and the finance, including via incentives, carbon pricing or other policy measures. Yet, outside the halls of climate conferences, the awareness about climate issues, risks or opportunities remains low across mainstream financial actors. Perhaps what is less apparent to the financial sector is that climate change is also creating enormous business opportunities – both in the form of investments that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and more importantly, through measures, tools, services, and indeed investments that enhance climate resilience. Supportive government policies can accelerate the recognition of these risks, and opportunities and in turn demonstrate that actions to address climate change can be profitable, ideally contributing to a virtuous cycle of investments that support climate policies and vice-versa. Furthermore, these opportunities not only help to mitigate financial risks, but also address risks to the wider economy.","[""abstract""]"

The paper proposes a method of attributing emissions from international transportation in global supply chains and calculating their impact on the economic sustainability of corporate organizations through a carbon price. 
 
 
 
 
Findings 
 
 
 
 
An application of the original model developed in this paper showed that international transport emissions can have an important effect on NEIs. An example of the imports of manufactured items from China and Germany to the USA showed a 3 per cent increase in emissions from manufacturing activities in the USA. 
 
 
 
 
Research limitations/implications 
 
 
 
 
Introducing carbon pricing on international transport emissions is expected to motivate corporate leaders to include emissions from international transport as a factor in their sourcing decisions. 
 
 
 
 
Practical implications 
 
 
 
 
Inclusion of international transport emissions along with the imposition of a carbon tax are designed to act as disincentives to generating emissions from supply chain activities. It is argued that the implementation of the model may provide long-term benefits associated with reduced emissions and a level playing field to organizations which use efficient technologies in manufacturing. 
 
 
 
 
Social implications 
 
 
 
 
It is recognized that the implementation of a carbon tax on international transport emissions may face resistance from several stakeholders, including governments of exporting countries, corporations and customers, due to an increase in cost.

However, there still exists interest in reducing emissions, especially from some members of Congress, and there are a number of federal policy options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions if Congress (or a new administration in 2021) so chooses. In this paper, we show that a federal economy-wide carbon tax on US carbon dioxide emissions could significantly contribute to the reductions necessary to fulfill the US international climate commitments. Using a detailed multi-sector computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, we predict the carbon price paths that would be necessary to meet the 28% emissions target and show the economic costs of such carbon-pricing policies. We then demonstrate how both the price paths and associated costs change if action is delayed.","[""abstract""]"

In practice, various market and behavioural failures, as well as political barriers, necessitate a policy mix that also encompasses policies to induce energy efficiency and stimulate the up-take of renewable energy sources. Minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) are one group of instruments to drive energy efficiency. However, MEPS are viewed very differently by different actors; some see them as complementary to carbon pricing, while others view them as market distortion. Recent studies indicate that MEPS for appliances and vehicles are currently the best performing climate policy instruments. There is a need for more research about how MEPS and carbon pricing policies interact and how they can best be combined for an effective climate policy mix. In this paper, we examine the advantages and potential of using MEPS to drive more ambitious climate policy. We first model the market price of appliances in a UK market and how life cycle costs (LCC) shift when the social cost of carbon (SCC) is factored in. We then examine how the inclusion of the SCC affects the point at which least life cycle costs (LLCC) for an appliance class are reached. We consider carbon prices ranging from the current carbon market price to high-end estimates of SCC, and then estimate the corresponding MEPS in each scenario. Finally, we discuss the implications for mixed policy design when climate change externalities are addressed primarily through MEPS, as well as the merits of such a policy approach.

The sugarcane industry will have a significant contribution to the achievement of such goal, through the displacement of automotive gasoline and the generation of electricity from the residual biomass from sugarcane. The main objective of this thesis is to evaluate in a systemic way the contribution of the sector in combating climate change, combining techniques of energy planning, land use modeling and GHGs emissions assessment, in this case considered the full life cycle of energy sources. The method is based on long-term simulations, using an improved version of the BLUM (Brazilian Land Use Model) model, which required regional identification of the sugarcane industry profile and trends up to 2030. The scenarios considered policies to foster bioelectricity generation, the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) into gasoline pricing structure, as well as the production of second generation (2G) ethanol. When carbon pricing is not considered, the results are far from the expected levels of production and consumption of automotive ethanol, leading to the conclusion that with the exclusive focus on technological development it is unlikely to achieve the goals regarding reduction of GHGs emissions. On the other hand, when the SCC emitted is considered on gasoline pricing structure, the results are much more significant. The 2G technology can significantly increase the availability of ethanol in the market, contributing to the achievement of the commitment targets. However, the results indicate a crowding-out effect (where 2G ethanol competes with both gasoline and first-generation ethanol) of up to 20% of additional 2G ethanol. The crowding-out effect of 2G ethanol is lower in the presence of carbon pricing policies. The higher price of bioelectricity results in a higher adoption of modern cogeneration systems and significant bioelectricity surpluses, but the results are still below the expected bioelectricity levels when bagasse is the only fuel used in cogeneration systems. However, when sugarcane trash is added into cogeneration (as a complementary fuel), bioelectricity surplus increases significantly, inducing also the production and consumption of ethanol. This shows the existence of synergistic effects, via profitability, between bioelectricity and ethanol production. The sensitivity analysis on the baseline electricity emission factor indicates quite broad results, but without affecting the main conclusions. Under the conditions considered in this study, it is possible to conclude that the benefits of first-generation ethanol combined with significant surplus electricity (including straw as fuel) may be larger in terms of GHG emissions than 2G ethanol, since the indirect land use effect found to be small in Brazil. It should be noted that these conclusions are valid for Brazil and solely for the objectives of GHGs emission reductions (no other sustainability indicator was evaluated) and cannot be replicated to other territories, particularly the ones where land use restrictions are more severe.","[""abstract""]"

This chapter discusses how an international climate agreement would turn the atmosphere into a common property regime and describes equity principles that determine how the resulting climate rent is distributed. It then estimates how carbon pricing in combination with appropriate revenue recycling could advance human development goals. It also considers equity aspects of distributing land and natural resource rents as well as the potential of these rents to promote global justice.

The first three papers use a dynamic programming approach to determine the optimal harvest decision for a forest stand in the boreal forest of western Canada that provides both timber harvest volume and carbon sequestration services. The last paper uses an analytical model to confirm the findings in the first three papers that show that the optimal rotation age is dependent on the carbon stocks in the dead organic matter and wood product pools. In the first paper, the state of the forest at any point in time is described by stand age and the amount of carbon in the dead organic matter pool. Stand age is used as the independent variable in merchantable timber volume and biomass functions. The results of the study indicate that while optimal harvest age is relatively insensitive to carbon stocks in dead organic matter, initial carbon stock levels significantly affect economic returns to carbon management. In the second paper, the system is described by three state variables: stand age and the amount of carbon in the dead organic matter and wood product pools. The results of the study suggest that optimal behaviour of a landowner does not change much between cases where the market considers and ignores carbon storage in the wood product pool or between cases where the market considers and ignores fossil fuel carbon emissions. The results also indicate that the optimal decision to harvest is sensitive to current stocks of carbon in the wood product pool, especially when carbon prices are high and the wood product stocks are also high. The third paper demonstrates that alternative baselines have little or no effect on the optimal decision, but can have a large effect on financial return to landowner. In the third paper, the forest stand is described by four state variables: the age of the stand, the initial stand age, carbon stocks in the DOM pool and the initial carbon stocks in the DOM pool. In the last paper, an analytical model is used to demonstrate that the optimal harvest decision is dependent on the initial DOM and wood product stocks. This finding is consistent with the results in the previous papers.","[""abstract""]"

This provides an opportunity to examine the demand for carbon mitigation efforts. Household voting patterns are found to mirror the voting patterns by the US Congress on national carbon legislation. Political liberals and more educated voters favor such regulations while suburbanites tend to oppose such initiatives. By pricing carbon, suburban land becomes less valuable. We find that homeowner communities in suburban areas are more likely to vote against such regulation, while homeowners in the center city area are more likely to favor carbon pricing. Homeowner communities close to high-speed rail stops are also more likely to support this legislation.","[""abstract""]"

A carbon tax imposed on all sectors unambiguously reduces aggregate emissions, but taxes targeted at the set of key sectors can lead to the greatest emissions reduction. Due to intersectoral linkages and a tax rebate effect, taxing non-key sectors dampens the reduction in aggregate emissions. A key sector typically not only produces a lot of emissions, but also has a large influence on emissions in the rest of the economy. We focus on incremental changes in carbon taxes—carbon tax reforms—to characterise the set of key sectors analytically.","[""abstract""]"

Explicit expressions are derived that show the leading-order dependence of the optimal carbon price on these uncertainties, the various climate betas, risk aversion, intergenerational inequality aversion and convexity of the climate damage specification. Our solution allows for skewness and mean reversion in stochastic shocks to the climate sensitivity and damage coefficients.

Border adjustments would require pricing of imports for their associated emissions to the same level as domestic goods, while exports to non-price countries may become eligible for refunds. Trade agreements under the WTO allow for such adjustment under its exemption clause provided countries do not agree to other corrective measures. As a highly sensitive measure, not only the complex technical and legal questions deserve attention, but how to make the best diplomacy of border adjustments requires careful consideration too.","[""abstract""]"

The first part of the thesis contains chapters 1 and 2 and is concerned with the high-frequency price and volatility analysis in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. The second part contains chapters 3, 4, and 5 and investigates the relationship between energy markets, stock markets, and the macroeconomy. 
 
The first chapter models the adjustment process of European Union Allowance prices to the releases of announcements at high-frequency controlling for intraday periodicity, volatility clustering and volatility persistence. The chapter reveals that the high-frequency EUA price dynamics are very well captured by a Fractionally Integrated Asymmetric Power GARCH process. The decisions of the European Commission on second National Allocation Plans have a strong and immediate impact on EUA prices. Further, EUA prices increase in response to better than expected news on the future economic development as well as the current economic activity in Germany and the U.S. 
 
The second chapter models the relationship of European Union Allowance spot prices and futures prices within the second commitment period of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. Based on high-frequency data, the transmission of information in the first and second conditional moments is analyzed. To reveal long-run price discovery, common factor weights and information shares are computed. The chapter identifies that the futures market is the leader of the long-run price discovery process and that the informational role of this market increases over time. In addition to the price discovery analysis, a version of the unrestricted extended Constant Conditional Correlation-GARCH process is estimated to analyze the volatility transmission structure. The analysis reveals a close relationship between the volatility dynamics of both markets, where in particular spillovers from the futures to the spot market are observed. As a whole the investigation reveals that information is first incorporated in the futures market and then transferred to the spot market. 
 
The third chapter empirically assesses whether the owners of companies covered by the EU-ETS are hit by the regulatory burden of the system. For this, a data set which contains companies of the sectors covered by the EU-ETS is analyzed. The chapter reveals that in the first commitment period the links between the carbon and the stock market are rather loose. For the second commitment period a strong impact of the carbon price on stock returns is found. Most importantly, the analysis reveals that sign and magnitude of the effect of the carbon price on stock returns reflect country- and sector-specific net compliance positions induced by heterogeneity in the allocation of emission allowances. Electricity stock returns are negatively affected by the carbon price, where in particular, the effect is most pronounced in countries with more restrictive emissions caps. On the other hand, non-electricity company stock returns are positively affected, where the effects are stronger in countries with more generous emissions caps. In conclusion, regulatory burden is shifted to owners of electricity companies, while owners of non-electricity companies seem to profit from the regulation. 
 
The fourth chapter investigates the relationship between U.S. stock price returns and crude oil returns. For this, a Dynamic Conditional Correlation Mixed Data Sampling GARCH specification is developed to endogenize the long-term correlation between crude oil and stock price returns with respect to the stance of the U.S. macroeconomy. The chapter reveals that variables which contain information on current and future economic activity are helpful predictors for changes in the oil-stock correlation. For the period 1993-2011 there is strong evidence for a counter cyclical behavior of the long-term correlation. For prolonged periods with strong growth above trend the model predicts a negative long-term correlation, while before and during recessions the sign changes and remains positive throughout the economic recovery. The results strongly suggest that crude oil prices cannot be viewed as being exogenous with respect to the U.S. macroeconomy and explain the controversial results concerning the oil-stock relationship in the previous literature. 
 
The fifth chapter empirically assesses the link between the U.S. stock market and the oil price in the period 2001-2011 given the theoretical framework of the ICAPM. For this, a three-step estimation strategy is applied, where dynamic conditional volatilities and correlations are estimated to compute conditional covariances between the individual stock returns, the market return, and the crude oil returns. Finally, individual stock returns are explained by the estimated covariances. The results indicate a positive relationship between the association of an asset and the market and the asset's expected return. Most importantly, the chapter reveals that the sensitivity of the investor's marginal utility of wealth with respect to the oil price is negative. This reflects that the investor is financially well off in periods of high oil prices which advocates the view that the oil price has predominantly been driven by shocks related to aggregate global demand during the analyzed sample period. It is shown that the investor demands for industry-specific stocks which are inversely related to the oil price and tend to pay off in periods of low oil prices and high marginal utility of wealth.","[""abstract""]"

Transitioning to clean energy will bring benefits and drawbacks and will create winners and losers. Who will decide how we transition? Our choice of policy tools will have significant implications for who controls the transition and how it unfolds. 
Many economists promote the role of market-based mechanisms like carbon taxes or cap-and-trade, mechanisms that rely largely on private actors to make crucial decisions. Under this view, government measures would fill in as necessary; they would complement market-based decarbonization mechanisms. 
Although market advocates treat the autonomy of private decisions as one of the market’s central virtues, I argue that that approach could shortchange collective deliberation on critical questions about our future path. I argue that government-driven climate action planning and prescriptive strategies should play a central role. Governmental institutions have the capacity to engage in expansive deliberation over the many values and tradeoffs at stake, the capacity for long-term planning, and a greater capacity for public engagement and democratic accountability than atomized decision-making in the energy marketplace. In this view, a carbon pricing mechanism could play an important role—but one that complements governance rather than the other way around.","[""abstract""]"

An energy–economy assessment","2018","24","ABSTRACT Brazil's nationally determined contribution (NDC) pledged under the Paris Agreement has marked a new stage in its climate policy towards strengthening low-carbon economic development beyond the recent drastic cuts in emissions from deforestation. Brazil especially means to limit oil consumption driven by future economic growth and to increase energy efficiency and biofuel use in the transport sector. On the other hand, Brazil still aspires to become a major petroleum province given its huge reserves of ‘pre-salt’ oil. This article aims to clarify under what conditions low-carbon economic development and oil exploration can possibly be combined in Brazil and what would be the energy system, environmental and macroeconomic implications of enabling policies for doing so. To address these questions, an energy–economy computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Brazilian economy is used to simulate alternative scenarios up to 2030. The results first show that implementing the most recent energy plans, which take into account the new economic reality in Brazil, should lead to over 20% lower domestic CO2 emissions in 2030 than the indicative NDC target, and to the export of the bulk of newfound crude oil. Second, with the same level of oil production, deeper domestic decarbonization, triggered by additional carbon pricing and sustainable efficiency measures, appears achievable with very small gross domestic product (GDP) loss and maximum oil exports, while being aligned with a 2°C emission pathway. However, (i) extra oil exports may induce net additional emissions outside Brazil and be seen as a perverse incentive and (ii) the economic growth strategy based on high oil exports may hinder the necessary diversification of the Brazilian economy. Key policy insights Low-carbon development goals will strongly interact with oil policy in Brazil. The 2030 NDC target should be easy to achieve considering the new economic reality in Brazil. Deeper domestic decarbonization is achievable with very limited GDP loss and significant oil exports, while being aligned with a 2°C emission pathway. A broad strategic vision is needed to reconcile climate policy, energy policy and other economic development objectives.","[""abstract""]"

Traditional public subsidy instruments such as grants and concessional loans, while critical to supporting nascent technologies or high-capital-cost projects, do not provide the price signals required to shift private investments towards low-carbon alternatives at a scale. Programmes that underwrite the value of emission reductions using auctioned price floors provide price certainty over long time horizons, thus improving the cost-effectiveness of limited public funds while also catalysing private investment. Taking lessons from the World Bank’s Pilot Auction Facility, which supports methane and nitrous oxide mitigation projects, and the United Kingdom’s Contracts for Difference programme, which supports renewable energy deployment, we show that auctioned price floors can be applied to a variety of sectors with greater efficiency and scalability than traditional subsidy instruments. We explore how this new class of instrument can enhance the cost-effectiveness of carbon pricing and complementary policies needed to achieve a 1.5°C outcome, including through large-scale adoption by the Green Climate Fund and other international and domestic climate finance vehicles. Key policy insights Traditional public climate finance interventions such as grants and concessional loans have not mobilized private capital at the scale needed to decarbonize the world economy consistent with the 2°C target, much less 1.5°C, and will likely face ongoing constraints in the future. Auctioned price floors – subsidies that offer a guaranteed price for future emission reductions – maximize climate impact per public dollar while incentivizing private investment in low-carbon technologies. This new subsidy instrument, if applied at scale via the Green Climate Fund and other domestic and international climate finance vehicles, can promote private sector competition to bring down technology costs and drive innovation, thereby supporting a longer term transition to regulation and sector- or economy-wide carbon markets. To facilitate the transition from public subsidy to the market-based support of climate mitigation, auctioned price floors should work in tandem with carbon pricing and complementary policies, using the same accounting and monitoring, reporting and verification toolkits.","[""abstract""]"

This is performed by constructing a baseline scenario without the ETS and assessing the impacts of the ETS, as currently designed. The results indicate that the ETS will start to impact emissions primarily after 2025 due to the prevalence of a sizable allowance surplus. The impact of approved (i.e. back-loading and 2.2% linear reduction factor (LRF)) and proposed (i.e. market stability reserve (MSR)) policy interventions and the inclusion of aviation, could accelerate the exhaustion of surplus and increase emission reductions during the investigated period. However, these measures would be insufficient to restore the scarcity of allowances and the corresponding carbon price before the start of ETS Phase IV, and the effectiveness of EU-internal abatement cannot be guaranteed until 2023. The effectiveness could be further reduced in the case of the economic shocks or the exclusion of international aviation. To restore the scarcity of allowances, other reform options are necessary. This paper extends the reasoning for the early removal of the back-loaded 900 Mtonne allowances by 2020 and broadening the scope of ETS to other sectors with potential high demand for allowances.","[""abstract""]"

We simulated the impacts arising from the Energy Modeling Forum’s broad range of carbon taxes under three revenue recycling options — lump sum redistributions, capital tax reductions, and labor tax cuts. We examined their consequences for industry prices and quantities, for the overall economy, and for the welfare of households, individuals, and society, the latter in terms of efficiency and equity. We rank recycling mechanisms from most to least favorable in terms of the magnitudes of their impacts on net social welfare — efficiency net of equity — recognizing that other objectives may be more important to policy makers and the public. Finally, we and the EMF 32 effort focus only on the economic effects of carbon taxation and revenue recycling; the environmental benefits arising from emissions reductions are not within our scope of study.We find CO2 emissions abatement to be invariant to the chosen recycling scheme. This means that policy makers need not compromise their environmental objectives when designing carbon tax swap options. We also find additional emissions reductions beyond the scope of coverage and points of taxation.Reducing capital taxes promotes new saving, investment and capital formation and is the most favorable recycling mechanism. In 2010 dollars, the welfare loss per ton abated ranges from $0.19 to $3.90 depending on the path of carbon prices. Reducing labor taxes promotes consumption and work through real-wage incentives and is the next most favorable recycling scheme. Here, the welfare loss per ton abated ranges from $11.09 to $16.49 depending on the carbon tax trajectory. Lump sum redistribution of carbon tax revenues is the least favorable recycling option. It incentivizes neither capital nor labor. Consequently, the damages to the economy and welfare are the greatest among the three schemes. With lump sum recycling, the welfare loss per ton abated ranges from $37.15 to $43.61 as carbon taxation becomes more aggressive. While this ranking is common among the participating EMF 32 models, the spread in our results is the greatest in comparison which we attribute to the substitution possibilities inherent in IGEM’s econometrics, the absence of barriers to factor mobility, and likely differences in the manner in which tax incentives are structured.We find welfare gains are possible under capital and labor tax recycling when emissions accounting is viewed from a top-down rather than a bottom-up perspective and carbon pricing is at an economy-wide average. However, these gains occur at the expense of abatement.We find capital tax recycling to be regressive while labor tax recycling is progressive as is redistribution through lump sums. Moreover, we find that the lump sum mechanism provides the best means for sheltering the poorest from the welfare consequences of carbon taxation. Thus, promoting capital formation is the best use of carbon tax revenues in terms of reducing the magnitudes of welfare losses while the lump sum and labor tax options are the best uses for reducing inequality.","[""abstract""]"

Unlike trading schemes in other countries, the Tokyo ETS covers indirect emissions from the commercial sector. It is well known that a variety of market barriers impede full realization of energy efficiency opportunities, especially in the commercial sector. Experiences with the Tokyo ETS should therefore provide important lessons for the design of climate change mitigation policies, especially when targeting the commercial sector. The emissions from covered entities have been drastically reduced from those at the scheme’s outset, with an average 14% reduction as of the end of the first commitment period of five years (2010–2014) compared with 2009 levels. This paper shows that the Tokyo ETS alone did not cause these reductions; there were other drivers. Among them, the energy savings triggered by the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 were crucial. The contribution of credit trading, in contrast, was limited since most of the covered entities reduced emissions by themselves. Through an investigation of official reports, an assessment of the emissions data from the covered entities compared to those of uncovered entities and in-depth interviews with firms covered by the scheme, this paper confirms that the main drivers of emissions reductions by covered entities were separate from the ETS. In fact, the advisory aspect of the scheme seems to be much more important in encouraging energy-saving actions. Key policy insights Most of the observed emission reductions were not caused by the Tokyo ETS alone. An advisory instrument was crucial to the effectiveness of the Tokyo ETS. The experience of the Tokyo ETS suggests that making full use of the advantages of emissions trading is difficult in the case of the commercial sector. Price signals have not provided a stimulus to climate change mitigation actions, which implies that establishing a cap to yield effective carbon prices poses a challenge.","[""abstract""]"

It makes use of data spanning the period January 2001 to March 2014 and a nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) model to test the relevant hypothesis. The empirical findings indicate that carbon prices have long-run asymmetric effects on electricity prices, with only positive changes in carbon prices signaling a complete pass-through. The results are expected to be of substantial importance for end-user prices and, thus, to enhance the information on the impact of CO2 prices on end-user electricity prices.

They differ in their recommended reduction targets and in the corresponding carbon prices to guide policy instruments such as taxes. Among the best-known exponents of opposing views are Nicholas Stern of the London School of Economics and William Nordhaus of Yale University. According to Stern, the social cost of carbon is about $85 per tonne of CO2 (Stern 2007: xvi), while Nordhaus offers a value of $7.40 per tonne of CO2 (Nordhaus 2008). In line with these values, Stern advises radical action now, while Nordhaus advises very modest climate policy. Laymen might easily conclude that this disagreement derives from controversy about human influence on the climatic system, particularly given the disproportionate attention given in the media to ‘climate sceptics’. Although some economists do indeed consider the IPCC’s assessment of the science of climate change ‘too alarmist’ (Tol 2014) or, on the contrary, stress the importance of low-probability catastrophes for climate cost-benefit analysis (CBA) (Weitzman 2009), Stern and Nordhaus hardly disagree on the actual science of climate change. In fact, as the IPCC already noted in 1995 (Arrow et al. 1996), most disagreement among economists originates from their use of different discount rates, the parameter used in CBA to compare future and present gains and losses. A discount rate of 5 per cent, for example, implies that a cost of $100 next year is valued equally to a cost of $95 this year, and that a cost of $100 in two years’ time is valued equally to a cost of about $91 this year. There are two related reasons why the choice of discount rate is of decisive importance in climate economics. First, in the case of climate policy the time spans separating costs and benefits may be very long indeed. Because of the inertia of the climate system, cause (emission or mitigation) and effect (climate damage) may be separated by millennia. Over such a time period a small change in the discount rate applied has huge consequences for the outcome of CBA: at a discount rate of 1 per cent, $1000 in 200 years’ time is valued as $137 today; at a discount rate of 5 per cent, $1000 in 200 years’ time is valued as only $0.06 today. Second, since cause and effect may be separated by millennia, it is future generations in particular that will be affected by our present choices. This makes the comparison of present and future costs and benefits pre-eminently an issue of ethics, and thus also subject to moral dispute. Although this dispute has a pedigree going back at least to the eighteenth-century writings of Jeremy Bentham and David Hume (Robinson 1990), the debate has intensified over the last decades given its importance for energy and climate policy. The literature shows a wide variety of opinions. See for landmark overviews e.g. Lind et al. (1982), Price (1993), Arrow et al. (1996) and Portney and Weyant (1999). Some authors dispute that the discount rate is a matter of ethics and argue that the discount rate should be deduced from the market interest rate. Others have argued for different discount rates on the basis of different moral theories such as utilitarianism, prioritarianism and deontological approaches. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an introduction and a literature review with respect to the issues involved in the longstanding debate in ethics and economics on whether discounting the future is morally justifiable. Section 1 will first offer a short introduction to Ramsey’s neo-classical model of economic growth. Understanding the basics of Ramsey’s model is pivotal for understanding both the vocabulary of the discounting debate and the complicated relation between ethics and efficiency. Subsequently, Section 2 describes the prescriptive-descriptive debate: the debate between those who argue that the discount rate ought to be based on preferences revealed through actual saving behaviour and those who argue that the discount rate ought to be based on moral principles. A variety of these moral principles is successively discussed in Sections 3 to 7. Section 7 offers some concluding remarks.","[""abstract""]"

The first chapter focuses on energy standards, and the second chapter focuses on green labels.The first chapter assesses whether commercial real estate market participants are willing to pay a premium for an energy efficient building that has not received a green label. I utilize a unique dataset of detailed building-level observations and a spatial semiparametric matching framework that exploits quasi experimental state-by-year variation in the implementation of mandatory building energy codes, to estimate selling price and rent premiums for a more stringent code. I find that buildings constructed under a more stringent energy code are associated with rent and selling price premiums of approximately 2.7% and 10%, respectively, compared to buildings constructed just before the code came into effect. When tenants pay directly for utilities, buildings constructed under an energy code are associated with 5.7% higher rents. While building energy codes have been promoted to address landlord-tenant informational asymmetries that would not be addressed by a carbon pricing strategy, these estimated premiums are consistent with complete capitalization of estimated building-level savings, and as such they cast doubt on the existence of an energy efficiency gap resulting from adverse selection between landlords and tenants. In the second chapter, I assess whether nonrandom selection affects the frequently-touted benefits of green-labeling policies in the commercial building stock. While green-labeled buildings have been found to sell at a premium compared to nearby controls with similar observable characteristics, the voluntary nature of the labeling decision implies green-labeled buildings may have different unmeasured characteristics that may account for at least a portion of the premium. Therefore, it is unclear whether green-labeled building premiums are a causal effect of the labels. I use data on repeat sales transactions and detailed hedonic characteristics to test whether green-labeled office buildings were selling at a premium before they were labeled, and combine these results with post-labeling price premium estimates to identify realized cost-benefit ratios for green-labeling policies. The data suggest the causal net benefits of green labels range from $11.50-$19.95 per square foot. The estimated net benefits are smaller than previous estimates that have focused solely on the benefits and ignored the potential biases from nonrandom selection.","[""abstract""]"

Strong actions will be necessary to limit the increase in global temperatures, and continued delays create risks of escalating climate change damages and future policy costs. These risks are system-wide, long-term and large-scale and thus hard to diversify across firms. Because of its unique scale, cost structure and near-term availability, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation in developing countries (REDD+) has significant potential to help manage climate policy risks and facilitate the transition to lower greenhouse gas emissions. ‘Call’ options contracts in the form of the right but not the obligation to buy high-quality emissions reduction credits from jurisdictional REDD+ programmes at a predetermined price per ton of CO2 could help unlock this potential despite the current lack of carbon markets that accept REDD+ for compliance. This approach could provide a globally important cost-containment mechanism and insurance for firms against higher future carbon prices, while channelling finance to avoid deforestation until policy uncertainties decline and carbon markets scale up. Key policy insights Climate policy uncertainty discourages abatement investments, exposing firms to an escalating systemic risk of future rapid increases in emission control expenditures. This situation poses a risk of an abatement ‘short squeeze,’ paralleling the case in financial markets when prices jump sharply as investors rush to square accounts on an investment they have sold ‘short’, one they have bet against and promised to repay later in anticipation of falling prices. There is likely to be a willingness to pay for mechanisms that hedge the risks of abruptly rising carbon prices, in particular for ‘call’ options, the right but not the obligation to buy high-quality emissions reduction credits at a predetermined price, due to the significantly lower upfront capital expenditure compared to other hedging alternatives. Establishing rules as soon as possible for compliance market acceptance of high-quality emissions reductions credits from REDD+ would facilitate REDD+ transactions, including via options-based contracts, which could help fill the gap of uncertain climate policies in the short and medium term.","[""abstract""]"

Finance, Nature, and Value in Carbon Markets","2018","15","This article examines the contradictions and possibilities of “nature as accumulation strategy” in light of the breakdown of accumulation in emissions trading and carbon offsetting schemes established by the European Union and United Nations. The first section revisits accounts of carbon markets as a state-driven accumulation strategy by drawing on work by geographers and other political economists who understand capitalist value relations as being actively constituted by nature and finance. The second section provides an overview of how carbon is traded and presents data to document the growth and decline of financial activity in the main global carbon markets, focusing on the impact of weak carbon prices. The third section analyzes accumulation dynamics in carbon markets in terms of the extent to which carbon has or could become an emergent form of capital. It argues that states have failed to support the carbon market accumulation strategy due to tensions between socioecological relations of appropriation and capitalization that are internal to the carbon commodity. It also argues, however, that the commodification of carbon, as “metanature,” contains the potential to sustain accumulation by comparing and enforcing the profitability of different forms of pollution. The conclusion discusses implications for critical political–economic research on finance, nature, and value in contemporary capitalism and the efficacy of market-based climate policy.","[""abstract""]"

In order to answer these questions, the dissertation has investigated the process of adoption of climate change policy in Canada’s ten provinces through four distinct stages: 1) the diffusion of the ideas supporting carbon pricing, 2) climate policy capacity building, 3) the public debate following the proposition of carbon pricing by the governing party, and 4) the design of the carbon pricing instrument. After reviewing the climate policy-making processes in the provinces, the dissertation’s answer to the first question is that carbon pricing instruments have been adopted in provinces in which the government has shown early on an acceptance of both the scientific paradigm of anthropogenic climate change and the policy paradigm of liberal environmentalism—the latter promoting market-based climate policy.

It uses IMACLIM-R, an E3 (Environment–Energy–Economy) model allowing for the integration of urban forms, transport dynamics, environmental policies and behaviors. Building upon the study of a set of local low carbon experiments throughout the European Union (EU), the paper explores two contrasted stylized scenarios of the low carbon transition in Europe. It highlights that carbon pricing policies are useful guides for transition but cannot achieve the ambitious objective without significant transition costs. It shows that low carbon experiments in the transport and energy sectors are critical dimensions of complementary measures in favor of green infrastructures. Broadening and upscaling low carbon experiments helps overcome the inertias of the transport sector by fostering radical changes in infrastructures, thereby introducing deep transformations in mobility behavior. This can then generate positive macroeconomic outcomes, even though they are also dependent on specific financial support, calling for a renegotiation of the social contract based on specific fiscal reforms and measures to secure funding for these initiatives. The paper concludes with some research avenues for improving this preliminary work and calls for a better understanding of the complexity of the socio-economic patterns of both the transition and the conditions for an effective implementation.","[""abstract""]"

Foreign direct investments (FDI) in renewable energy (RE) have increased over the last years, contributing to the diffusion of RE globally. In the field of climate policy, there are multiple policy instruments aimed at attracting investments in renewable energy. This article aims to map the FDI flows globally including source and destination countries. Furthermore, the article investigates which policy instruments attract more FDI in RE sectors such as solar, wind and biomass, based on an econometric analysis of 137 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and non-OECD countries. The results show that Feed in Tariffs (FIT) followed by Fiscal Measures (FM), such as tax incentives and Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS), are the most significant policy instrument that attract FDI in the RE sector globally. Regarding carbon pricing instruments, based on our analysis, carbon tax proved to be correlated with high attraction of FDI in OECD countries, whereas Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) proved to be correlated with high attraction of FDI mainly in non-OECD countries. Key policy insights Feed in Tariffs is the most significant policy instrument that attracts FDI in the Renewable Energy sector globally. Fiscal Measures (FM), such as tax incentives, show a significant and positive impact on renewable energy projects by foreign investors, and particularly on solar energy. Carbon pricing instruments, such as carbon taxation and emissions trading, proved to attract FDI in OECD and non-OECD countries respectively. Public investments, such as government funds for renewable energy projects, proved not as attractive to foreign private investors, perhaps because public funds are not perceived as stable in the long run.","[""abstract""]"

This paper studies the optimal emission abatement decision for firms in a supply chain, considering emission costs. Four Stackelberg models are established that differ in free emission allowance allocation schemes and emission abatement cost-sharing schemes. On comparing optimal solutions in the models, the results show that regardless of which free emission allowance allocation scheme or emission abatement cost-sharing scheme is adopted, upstream firms tend to set a higher emission reduction rate. If supply chain firms aim for a higher emission reduction rate, they should advocate that upstream and downstream firms establish emission abatement cost-sharing contracts. The upstream firms should undertake larger emission reduction costs, and use free emission allowance allocation schemes based on emission intensity; the optimal emission reduction rate is related to carbon price, and the relationship may not be monotonous, affected by the difficulty of reducing emissions.","[""abstract""]"

However, despite achieving its emissions reductions targets at lower than expected costs, the system has been considered a disappointment in the political arena. A major source of disillusionment with the California system has been its failure to generate the expected amount of revenues that would have contributed to a wide range of public expenditures.

Here we use recently available satellite-based maps of annual forest loss between 2001–2012, along with information on topography, accessibility, protected status, potential agricultural revenue, and an observed inverted-U-shaped relationship between forest cover loss and forest cover, to project tropical deforestation from 2016–2050 under alternative policy scenarios and to construct new marginal abatement cost curves for reducing emissions from tropical deforestation. We project that without new forest conservation policies 289 million hectares of tropical forest will be cleared from 2016–2050, releasing 169 GtCO2. A carbon price of US$20/tCO2 ($50/tCO2) across tropical countries would avoid 41 GtCO2 (77 GtCO2) from 2016–2050. By comparison, we estimate that Brazil’s restrictive policies in the Amazon between 2004–2012 successfully decoupled potential agricultural revenue from deforestation and reduced deforestation by 47% below what would have otherwise occurred, preventing the emission of 5.2 GtCO2.

This paper analyzes optimal carbon pricing while taking into account interactions with the taxation of labor and capital income. In an otherwise standard climate-economy model, the policy maker has to resort to a distortionary tax on labor and capital income, and is unable to commit to future policies. I show that the optimal time-consistent carbon price is in general not at its Pigouvian level, that is, at the level of marginal damages induced by climate change. This is due to the presence of costs and benefits of emitting carbon that only materialize in the presence of income taxes. Quantitatively, I find that in a standard calibration of the model, this tax-interaction effect accounts for deviation of the optimal tax from the level of marginal climate damages in the ballpark of 10%, due to the second-best effects partially offsetting each other. Compared to a setting with lump-sum income taxes, I observe a smaller optimal carbon price without commitment, with the average differences over time amounting to 14%.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

The thesis approaches this question by drawingin particular on the 10 years of experience of the EU with carbon pricing as the dominant tool for decarbonising EITE sectors. This is done in two steps. Firstly, by empirically evaluating existing EU policy solutions and asking whether the policies ultimately meet basic criteria for environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, and policy coherence with respect to the long-term goals of EU climate mitigation. A number of important policy gaps and incoherencies are identified in this way that are of themselves interesting and of relevant to current policy settings. Secondly, this thesis takes a step back and questions and ultimately challenges the idea that the overarching policy framework of the EU– in particular the dominant role of the EU ETS carbon market – is sufficient for decarbonising these sectors in the longer term.","[""abstract""]"

Owing to its roots in the environmental justice movement, addressing systemic racism is central to climate justice praxis in the United States, which is a necessary intervention in typically technocratic climate politics. What emerges from US climate justice is a moral appeal to ‘relationship’ as politics, the procedural demand that communities of color (the ‘frontline’) lead the movement, and a distributive claim on carbon pricing revenue. However, this praxis precludes a critique of racial capitalism, the process that relies on structural racism to enhance accumulation, alienating, exploiting, and immiserating black, brown, and white, while carrying out ecocide. The lack of an analysis of how class and race produce the crises climate justice confronts prevents the movement from demanding that global north fossil fuel abolition occur in tandem with the reassertion of the public over the private and de-growth. Drawing on research conducted primarily in Oregon and Washington, I argue that race works to both create and limit the transformative possibilities of climate politics.","[""abstract""]"

This chapter aims to fill this void by highlighting the potentials and risks of linking carbon tax systems with other carbon pricing instruments across national borders. The authors show that the linking of carbon tax systems can lead to significant climate integrity risks, potentially resulting in a net increase of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The authors highlight different options as to how these risks can be addressed by making use of the new structure that has been established with the Paris Agreement.

Our analysis indicates that traditional forest sequestration policies have underestimated the costs of climatemitigation, driving forest-based actions in regionswhere subsequent changes in albedo are significant. To reduce this inefficiency, this paper proposes a novel approachwhere both carbon sequestration and albedo effect are incorporated into pricing. Our results suggest that, under the same carbon price path, the integrative policy provides greater net globalmitigation in absolute terms and per hectare of forest, and thus it ismore efficient and less intrusive than the traditional policy.","[""abstract""]"

This thesis explores a market-based tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming. Specifically, it uses the California cap-and-trade program as a case study. It provides background information on this program, which was established from the California Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32) and in 2017 was extended to 2030. Evaluating market-based tools is becoming increasingly important as countries and states look for ways to reduce climate pollution and create investments in a clean energy future. Through analysis of government reports and a literature review, this paper finds that the program is not performing at its optimum. It recommends reducing the number of allocated permits to increase the demand and the price. Additionally, it recommends implementation of processes that evaluate and reconsider how different programs created under AB 32 can complement carbon pricing—not undermine its ability to reduce emissions. Although the California cap-and-trade program is not performing at its optimum, the program represents California’s commitment to addressing climate change and acts as an international inspiration for climate action. There are multiple states that are currently considering implementing carbon pricing tools. This paper concludes by providing an overview of the pending carbon legislation in Oregon.

However, previous studies using computable general equilibrium (CGE) models have analyzed climate policies without considering company size. This may have led to inaccurate results because the impacts of climate policy would differ depending on the coverage of regulated companies. Accordingly, this study examines the environmental and economic impacts of greenhouse gas emission reduction policies, assuming policy results vary by firm size, as covered by the Korean emission trading system. To this end, a CGE model with a separate social accounting matrix based on company size is used to compare three scenarios that reflect different types of carbon pricing methods. The results show that greenhouse gases will be reduced to a lower extent and utility will decrease more if mitigation policies are only imposed to large companies. Key policy insights Carbon pricing policies should consider the different impacts on companies of different sizes and industry sectors. Without considering the different sizes of companies covered by an ETS, the expected carbon price and its economic impact will be underestimated. Small and medium-sized companies will face more negative impacts than large companies in some industry sectors under an ETS, even if the mitigation burden is only faced by large companies.","[""abstract""]"

Carbon pricing is used next to a range of traditional energy taxes and renewable energy policies such as feed-in tariffs and minimal renewable generation targets. Several countries introduced carbon taxes alongside existing energy taxes such as excise duties on vehicle fuels. Since 2005, the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) has attached a direct price to the GHG emissions of ETS companies. The combination of multiple instruments and explicit and indirect carbon price signals created a complex and frequently changing institutional landscape that blurs the contribution of each policy instrument. Can the decarbonization of the European economy be attributed to carbon price instruments or to renewable energy policies together with other fiscal instruments? This paper clarifies the relative impact of explicit carbon price instruments (carbon taxes and EU ETS) compared to other instruments, namely renewable energy policies and indirect carbon price signals (general energy taxes). The methodology is based on the calculation of the implicit carbon price in existing fiscal systems. On the basis of panel data for 30 European countries 1995–2016, several fixed-effect regression estimations were performed. The results indicate a greater but decreasing impact of price instruments on carbon intensity compared to renewable energy policies and a greater but decreasing relative impact of indirect price signals compared to explicit ones.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

One option the general public approves of is to use them to support renewable energy. If this consists in reducing a pre-existing electricity levy that heterogeneously applies to the various sectors of the economy, the reduction of this distortionary tax thanks to the carbon revenues results in general equilibrium effects that may have unequal sectoral impacts. This is what we examine in the case of the European Union. With a modelling approach including a detailed disaggregation of European sectors, we find that using auction revenues from the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) to support electricity generation from renewable sources results in a 2% rise in electricity demand in the whole economy due to the reduced electricity levy that electricity consumers have to pay to support renewable energy. This results in a 1.8% ETS carbon price increase. The carbon constraint for the non-ETS sectors is 5.9% looser as a consequence of the larger electricity use by these sectors. While the energy intensive sectors generally benefit from electricity levy exemptions, we observe that, due to the energy and ETS price increase, the combination of these exemptions and of the use of carbon auction revenues to support renewable energy makes the ETS sectors worse off than if carbon revenues are transferred to households. In aggregate, the recycling option analysed here results in a GDP gain due to its impacts on the non-ETS sectors, the reduction of the electricity levy and associated distortionary effects.","[""abstract""]"

Border carbon adjustment (BCA) would address such carbon leakage concerns by using trade measures to ensure that products from foreign producers facing lower (or no) carbon prices are on equal footing with domestically produced goods. Despite intuitive economic appeal, BCA requires numerous challenging regulatory choices, including its scope of applicability (i.e., which policies, goods, sectors, countries), the methodology for assessing the carbon content of products, the type and price of the adjustment, scenarios requiring modification, and how the resulting revenues will be used. Each of these choices has economic and environmental implications that influence the effectiveness of the BCA, as well as nuanced technical, legal, and political consequences that must be considered. In particular, the design of any BCA must comport with international agreements governing trade and climate policy responsibilities. This article reviews the economic and legal literature on BCA, provides guidance for the design and implementation of BCAs, and identifies research priorities.","[""abstract""]"

Price Setting in European Electricity Markets: An Application to the Proposed Dutch Carbon Price Floor","2019","3","Upon discussion of price setting on electricity wholesale markets, many refer to the so-called merit order model. Conventional wisdom holds that during most hours of the year, coal- or natural gas-fired power plants set the price on European markets. In this context, this paper analyses price setting on European power markets. We use a fundamental electricity market model of interconnected bidding zones to determine hourly price-setting technologies for the year 2020. We find a price-setting pattern that is more complex and nuanced than the conventional wisdom suggests: across all researched countries, coal- and natural gas-fired power plants set the price for only 40 per cent of all hours. Other power generation technologies such as wind, biomass, hydro and nuclear power plants as well as lignite-fired plants set the price during the rest of the year. On some markets, the price setting is characterised by a high level of interconnectivity and thus foreign influence – as illustrated by the example of the Netherlands. During some 75 per cent of hours, foreign power plants set the price on the Dutch market, whilst price setting in other more isolated markets is barely affected by foreign markets. Hence, applying the price setting analysis to the proposed Dutch carbon price floor, we show that different carbon prices have little effect on the technological structure of the price-setting units. In this respect, the impacts of the unilateral initiative are limited. There are, however, considerable changes to be observed in wholesale power prices, import/export balances as well as production volumes and subsequent CO2 outputs of lignite-, coal- and gas-fired power plants.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

The results show relatively cheap emissions reductions from land-use changes and agriculture in the short run: the cost of the Brazilian NDC is predicted to be only 0.7 per cent of GDP in 2030. Further efforts to reduce carbon emissions beyond 2030 would require policy changes, since all the potential emissions reductions from deforestation would be finished and the capacity to expand renewable energy sources would be constrained. In this case, an economy-wide carbon pricing system would help substantially to avoid higher compliance costs.","[""abstract""]"

The budget deficit to GDP ratio is fixed at the base-case level in all scenarios. We examine the economic efficiency using three indicators, including real GDP, real GNP and the erosion of the tax base.

The strong form is less certain and varies. Nevertheless, the deviations in emission intensity of GDP are similar across the revenue recycling schemes.","[""abstract""]"

Even with large misperceptions, the extra welfare gains from complementing efficient pricing policies with energy efficiency standards are zero for reducing gasoline and 5 percent for reducing electricity. And when viewed as substitutes, these standards forgo 60 percent or more of the potential welfare gains from corresponding pricing policies. A combination of energy efficiency and emissions standards is more than three times as costly as carbon pricing when there is no misperception over energy savings, and even with large misperceptions, combining carbon pricing with gasoline/electricity taxes is better than combining it with energy efficiency standards.","[""abstract""]"

We provide the rate of convergence of the method in terms of the time step used to discretize the problem, of the size of the local hypercubes involved in the regressions, and of the truncating time horizon. To make the method viable for problems in high dimension and long time horizon, we extend a memory reduction method to the general Euler scheme, so that, when performing the numerical resolution, the storage of the Monte Carlo simulation paths is not needed. Then, we apply this algorithm to a model of optimal investment in power plants. This model takes into account electricity demand, cointegrated fuel prices, carbon price and random outages of power plants. It computes the optimal level of investment in each generation technology, considered as a whole, w.r.t. the electricity spot price. This electricity price is itself built according to a new extended structural model. In particular, it is a function of several factors, among which the installed capacities.

Overall, we find relatively small impacts on energy-intensive industries with the rebates in place. The average reduction in EITE output is 0.4 percent. There is, however, considerable variation in impacts among the EITE industries.

This requires a radical redirection and acceleration of technological change towards lowand particularly zero-carbon solutions. Global carbon pricing is seen as a key enabler for such decarbonization, with the European Union’s Emission Trading System (EU ETS) serving as an important pillar. In this paper, I therefore review the evidence on the innovation impact of the EU ETS. The review shows a very limited effect of the scheme on technological innovation, but there are clear signs of it having stimulated organizational innovation, with the impact being more pronounced for the electricity sector than for industry. The initially high expectations of the EU ETS regarding technological innovation largely dissipated once the scheme’s lack of stringency became apparent and prices collapsed accordingly. Also, for many of the rather incremental innovations that have taken place, the EU ETS was shown to be only one contributing factor among others, with the broader policy mix and long-term targets playing a particularly pivotal role in stimulating innovation. In contrast, there is clear evidence that the EU ETS has been a key driver of various organizational innovations, including making climate change a top management issue. However, so far, these organizational innovations have only had limited effects on shifting corporate strategies towards low-carbon solutions because of low carbon prices, the relatively high share of free allocations in industry, and more pressing business concerns. Despite this, the scheme’s positive impact on organizational innovations should not be underestimated, as these constitute a necessary precondition for future technological innovations. The findings suggest that the Commission’s proposal for the fourth trading period of the EU ETS points in the right direction, but further efforts will be needed to significantly increase the scarcity of EU allowances and the share of auctioning in order to fully unleash the scheme’s transformative power. If the identified shortcomings are not addressed, the EU ETS cannot play its foreseen role in guiding the decarbonization of the European economy, for which innovations in low-carbon solutions are a fundamental requirement.

Furthermore, we show that the abating region has an inverse N-shaped emission path, with growing emissions in the period for which the ceiling is binding. In addition, there is a phase in which this region has a positive carbon price, but higher emissions than the non-abating region.

"16570686","null","null","Carbon Price Uncertainty and Power Plant Greenfield Investment in Europe","2010","4","One of the stated objective of the EU ETS policy is to incentivize investment in low-carbon or carbon-free power generation technologies. Still, so far, the uncertainty about future carbon prices and the existence of technology-dedicated incentives like subsidies for CCS and feed-in tariffs or green certificates, might indicate that the carbon price has hardly played that role. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, the method developed should help utilities decision-makers integrate their views on carbon prices in an investment decision framework. Second, the method employed should ultimately help identify sensitivity points to guide policymakers when designing amendments to the rules governing the EU ETS. In order to understand how corporate decisions under carbon price uncertainty are taken, we model a utility’s investment decision in a multivariate real options framework. We consider a European utility that has a 10-year window to invest in a combination of various generation technologies (nuclear, IGCC, CCGT, pulverized coal and offshore wind). The model specifically account for uncertainty in carbon and power prices. The model is solved using the least-squares Monte Carlo approach (Longstaff and Schwartz, 2001 and Gamba, 2003) in order to account for various sources of uncertainty. Compared to the existing literature, we adapt the method to explicitly allow for capital rationing and choose among various technologies rather than just determining an optimal option exercise time. Policy-wise, early results of the model indicate that attempts to limit market price volatility and / or ensure a quick reversion to long-term equilibrium are of little help when compared to giving indications regarding significant cap level at various points in time (indicative of the deterministic trend). Furthermore, the price of carbon only contributes little to shifting investment decisions towards carbon-neutral or lower carbon investments.

Finally, we discuss the likely effects on economic growth on CO2 emissions and carbon prices as a by product.

Such risks and their extent can be reflected in choosing the discount rate of the project, where investors expect higher returns to compensate them for risk taking. Because of the regulatory nature of the industry, the limited number of players and the unique nature of electricity and its continuous rise in demand, the average project in the electricity supply industry (ESI) is less risky than the average investment in the stock exchange. However, each project has its own risk; projects that involve new technologies (renewable and clean-coal technologies), or projects with lengthy lead times (nuclear and hydro-power), involve a lot of investment and have more than the average level of risk. Some of the risks are related to engineering and technology; however, market risks equally exist. Recently, two other risk factors are affecting the ESI. The first relates to carbon pricing and legislation - discussed in more details in earlier chapters. Long-term investments in carbon-intensive generation like coal firing plants are highly vulnerable to variations in possible carbon pricing and trading as well as future legislation. Another risk factor is that provided by the wider investments in renewables, particularly wind and solar energy. These as already explained provide distribution to the operation of the generating system and its economics, thus providing another risk to the system investors. Both these two risk elements as well as many others are discussed in detail below.","[""abstract""]"

Traditional hybrid approaches emphasise automatic response to lower than anticipated abatement costs, but we find adjusting emissions targets over time is the better way to deal with this in the context of climate policy. We find, however, that a price floor is well suited to addressing policy generated carbon price risk as domestic and international policy frameworks mature, reducing the risk of unintended low carbon prices. Reducing such downside risk can encourage cost effective investment in low-emissions assets that might otherwise be precluded by perceived policy risks, even if the price floor is never actually triggered. In Australia's planned ETS, a price floor could support investments that lower the national emissions trajectory, and boost policy stability and credibility. A price floor in operation can increase the static costs of achieving a given emissions target, but reduce economic costs over time. Assessment of implementation options suggests a domestic reserve price for auctioned permits along with a periodically adjusted fee on the conversion of international permits for use in the domestic ETS. This approach minimises administrative complexity and avoids arbitrary interventions in carbon markets.","[""abstract""]"

At the same time, demand for energy services of Chinese households is very likely to increase as a result of continually improved living standards. Space heating already accounts for almost 40% of energy consumption in the residential sector in China. Thus the energy performance of buildings in Chinese cities represents a major challenge for ensuring energy supply security and combating climate change in the next decades. Several regulations relating to the requirement of the thermal performance of housing entered into force in China successively since the 1990s, the long term consequences of failure in enforcement and implementation have been examined from both energy security and climate protection perspectives. Nevertheless, few of studies in literature have addressed the issue from the perspective of economic investment decision. None of previous studies have studied the extent to which the current decision on more or less efficient standards in the large-scale urban infrastructure like buildings will have ultimately impact on the financing capacity in transforming the society toward low-carbon energy supply and consumption model, and the role the energy efficiency in buildings will play in enabling the public authority to harness the benefits resulting from reduced operation costs in early stage to facilitating the investment in new technology research and development and deployment in the future. The thesis seeks to answer two fundamental questions: 1. Is there an optimal development pathway to buildings energy performance standards in the context of extremely rapid urbanisation in China? 2. If so, what are political and economic instruments to put in place to limit growth in energy demand and CO2 emissions in this sector by taking the economic and institutional characteristics into account? Based on a modelling approach, we compare a variety of strategies to manage energy demand in buildings and their economic costs in a Chinese city by 2030. Our quantitative analysis in the first part of thesis shows that the adoption of current Chinese BEE standards not only fails to achieve an optimal level from societal point of view, but would also be the most costly amongst the technical options available today even without taking into account any cost of environmental externalities. Inclusion of carbon price will certainly favour the high-efficiency construction technology. More importantly, the city-level long-term modelling results show that even partial non-compliance of building energy efficiency today will result in tremendous difficulty in transforming the whole infrastructure under climate and economic constraints. Financing the new generation of low-carbon supply technologies such as renewable heating and carbon capture and storage (CCS) require taking into account the buildings thermal quality without any delays, otherwise the whole urban infrastructure would be saddled with high operation costs dilemma for several decades because both retrofitting and alternative energy supply in this case would be extremely costly and difficult to undertake. Therefore we strongly recommend that serious attention must be attached to efficiency issue today, and the current thermal regulations should be strengthened significantly and quickly to avoid irreversible carbon lock-in deadlock in the next two decades. Indeed, financial shortage appears not to be the insurmountable barriers to upgrading the current efficiency standards based on our modelling results, instead the institutional aspect may be the main obstacle to the no-lose strategy that allows benefits creation and redistribution. Several economic and policy instruments are analysed in the second part to accompany the actions of buildings performance amelioration with removal of institutional barriers. We develop three main models to accompany the learning of high-efficiency construction technology and processing industry : 1). Establishment of a carbon financing system via the integration of the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol into the construction sector ; 2). Flexibility of land use regulations on property developing and city zoning ; 3). Creation of economic incentives to facilitate third-financing of energy efficiency in buildings, including the involvement of municipal heat companies. In this regard, district heating pricing reform must be carried out accordingly","[""abstract""]"

Much of this rolling stock is no longer efficient. Largely as a result of infrastructure constraints, it is not feasible for operators to dispense with their old technology at regular intervals, even though they will need to pay more to use older technology if a carbon price eventuates. This report seeks to ascertain the viability of promoting investment incentives for newly acquired locomotives, wagons and other equipment. It analyses the impact of accelerated depreciation on the investment behaviour of above-rail operators and offers a comparison with alternative incentives or mechanisms.

The relocation of firms and productive activities is the most adverse consequence of unilateral carbon pricing. We analyze countries' strategic choice of environmental taxes implemented to control the emissions in an imperfectly competitive sector of the economy. Wage effects prevent all firms from locating in the same country when tax levels differ across countries. We demonstrate that environmental taxes are set at an inefficiently low level, compared to a non-strategic reference case where the environmental externalities between countries are neglected. The effect is particularly pronounced when firms are mobile. Hence, the possibility of firm relocation offers a plausible explanation why few countries have implemented effective carbon prices unilaterally until today. In our model, the relation between the strength of the environmental externalities and welfare is non-linear. Under some conditions, countries beneffit when externalities become stronger, due to a coordinating effect. In the absence of environmental externalities, tax competition vanishes.","[""abstract""]"

Then, a system-wide model of the National Airspace System analyzes the resulting schedules and determines preand post-tax flight operational performances, specifically average delay. Finally, a model that measures fuel burn and emissions based on flight trajectories is used to estimate the change in environmental impact from schedule adjustments made by the airlines in response to the carbon tax.

From the pilot it has been estimated that investment in the creation of institutions that reveal relevant information including environmental metrics generated an economic efficiency gain of 30% in the allocation of conservation contracts. A further advantage of the creation of environmental markets is scope for the carbon market to fund a proportion of government budgets required to fund public goods such as terrestrial and aquatic habitat conservation. This finding arises because of the multiple outcomes associated with landscape intervention. This cost-sharing effect becomes larger as carbon prices rise.","[""abstract""]"

Decisions adopted in the 16th Conference of the Parties (COP16) to the UNFCCC in Cancun, 2010 acknowledged sub-national or jurisdictional approaches, as an interim measure, for REDD+ accounting and monitoring. A jurisdictional approach is the nation-wide approach under which a sub-national government implements and administers REDD+ program. The study focusses on Vietnam which is working on multiple phases of REDD+ and is taking action at multiple scales. The country is exploring nested approaches to integrate jurisdictional REDD+ activities into national REDD+ schemes. Jurisdictional REDD+ implementation (JRI) involves both state and non-state actors and opens the door for private-sector engagement in REDD+. For the JRI, the government needs to identify potential jurisdictions and decide upon priority areas. In addition, whether realistic jurisdictional REDD+ implementation is achievable from technical, operational, financial and policy perspective, needs to be analyzed before the decision for a specific jurisdiction is made. To inform such decision making, this study attempts to evaluate the viability of the jurisdictional REDD+ implementation in Dinh Hoa District, Vietnam. The study provides an understanding of JRI feasibility in a jurisdiction and suggests potential REDD+ activities in household-based forestry. The research examined the viability of the jurisdictional REDD+ implementation as a combination of technical, operational, financial and political aspects. 
 
The study conducted ground-based forest inventories to estimate carbon stocks in forests. Forest cover change was assessed using remote sensing and geographic information systems. Based on findings of the forest inventories and forest cover change analysis, technically feasible REDD+ activities were identified. The study used household surveys to assess the perception and attitude of local households towards forest management, forest land allocation and REDD+. Outcomes of the assessments were used to evaluate operational feasibility and local acceptability of the JRI. Net present value (NPV) and benefit-cost ratio (BCR) were used to measure financial viability of natural forests and planted forest management. A rigorous desk review of national legal and regulatory frameworks and institutional arrangements for REDD+ implementation was conducted to explore whether the frameworks are supportive for operationalizing jurisdictional REDD+. 
 
From technical perspective, conservation of forest carbon stocks through protection of existing forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks- through restoration of degraded forest lands with assisted natural regeneration would be promising REDD+ activities for Protection forests and Special use forests. A recent trend of conversion of degraded natural forests to planted forests indicates sustainable management of forests through enrichment planting, and reducing emissions from deforestation through avoided planned deforestation might be further activities to be considered. 
 
Benefit-cost ratio of greater than one and NPV of benefits of US$25 per ha per year revealed household-based natural forest management is economically feasible in Vietnam. The NPV indicates opportunity costs of forest conservation under REDD+ to the household. This implies that carbon markets under a REDD+ mechanism may entail high opportunity costs compared with the current carbon price in international market. JRI might be financially attractive to the households, if it provides incomes additional to the current income from the forest management under the HBFM. 
 
Jurisdictional REDD+ implementation is politically acceptable and compliant with requirements of national legal and regulatory frameworks and UNFCCC REDD+ process. The Vietnamese multi-tiered and partially decentralized institutional arrangements for REDD+ implementation are highly supportive to a jurisdictional REDD+ approach. However, low level of knowledge and understanding about REDD+ among local stakeholders is an impediment for the JRI. Capacity of all state and non-state actors, particularly of ethnic minority groups, and forest-adjacent households needs to be strengthened. 
 
The small-holders showed positive perception towards the household-based forest management regime and positive attitudes to forest land allocation and REDD+ initiatives. Positive perceptions and attitudes on conservation initiatives are good indicators for the sustainability of a REDD+ mechanism and indicate the likelihood that the local residents will continue to be involved in the implementation of the regime. Participation of local stakeholders is considered as building block for efficiency of REDD+ and its success which depends on its legitimacy. The substantive participation of the households and state-actors in the forest management regime encouraged an inclusive and informed decision-making process. Long-term land tenure, secured and explicit forest-use rights, mutually understood and respected roles and responsibilities, and accessible institutions and processes ensured traditional, legal and local legitimacy. Thus, jurisdictional REDD+ implementation is conceptually feasible and operational, provided that REDD+ activities are coherent to and embrace the concomitant policies, programs and practices. This is equally important for political adoption and local legitimacy of REDD+ at local level. The study suggested jurisdictional REDD+ implementation is technically feasible, operationally achievable, financially viable, and politically acceptable.","[""abstract""]"

Given their status as the two largest integrated economies in the world, a transatlantic link between the EU ETS and a future federal US system would not only be a strong political signal for the creation of a global carbon market, but would eliminate competitive concerns between these two players caused by different carbon prices. If a combined EU-US market was established, this transatlantic market would provide the backbone for the overall international climate regime, with subsequent enlargements to other developed and developing countries. However, the environmental and economic benefits of emissions trading and by extension of linking crucially depend on the design of the trading systems. This paper therefore analyses the designs of the EU ETS, the US Waxman-Markey and Lieberman-Warner proposals for a federal US ETS, and the US Western Climate Initiative (WCI) to assess whether these (proposed) systems have design features that would lead to negative environmental or economic impacts in the case of linking. Particular areas of concern are the protection of the environmental integrity of the trading system as a whole, avoidance of negative economic or distributional impacts, and protection of design choices made in the establishment of an ETS. In addition to the discussion of design elements, the paper also examines possible mechanisms for linking the EU to an US ETS. There exist various possible forms of linking, such as direct and indirect, bilateral and unilateral links, as well as various possible legal mechanisms to implement the link, such as treaties or more informal agreements. It emerges that the recent Waxman-Markey discussion draft includes far fewer barriers to linking with the EU-ETS than earlier draft US legislation; still, certain differences are identified that will first need to be resolved. By contrast, the Lieberman-Warner scheme would be designed more differently from the EU ETS in crucial respects, such as the stringency of the cap and the inclusion of cost-containment measures. The WCI system would again be more compatible with the EU ETS, but here, as well there would be some possible concerns related to linking, in particular as regards the recognition of external units and the stringency of the targets. A full bilateral link between the EU and the USA is probably still some time away, although the new Waxman-Markey draft clearly improves the prospects for a transatlantic link.","[""abstract""]"

Specifically, the country has introduced support schemes for electricity generation from renewable energy sources (RES-E) and a national carbon tax. Therefore, these two instruments interact within the climate-energy policy mix. However, the interaction between them could be complementary or overlapping depending on the policy design of each instrument. The main objective of this thesis is to analyze if the policy design elements of the carbon tax and the RESE support schemes make them complementary or overlapping instruments. This specifically through the comparison of the instruments’ policy objectives. Furthermore, the thesis elaborates on why the coexistence of both instruments is justified. The methodology was mainly qualitative and encompassed descriptive as well as interpretive stages. Additionally, it comprised a comprehensive literature review on the interaction between mitigation, as well as, renewable energy policy instruments and a content analysis based on interviews with related stakeholders. Results show that the policy objective design element from the instruments was crucial to classify them as complementary and to conclude that their coexistence is justified. This is, the mitigation objective of the carbon tax and the energy security aim of the RES-E support schemes suggest both instruments are complementary. Moreover, an essential policy design element like the nature of the instrument is fundamental on the way it will interact with other instruments. For instance, a quantity-based instrument such as an emission trading scheme will interact differently than a price-based instrument, e.g. a carbon tax, with a RES-E support scheme. In an ETS the carbon price might change with the introduction of a RES-E support scheme, whereas the carbon rate in the tax will be always the same. Consequently, the thesis also found further research areas which include to analyze the effect of the existent RES-E support schemes on the carbon price within an ETS. This considering that currently there is a price floor provided by the carbon tax. (Less)","[""abstract""]"

The Government expects that the ERF will help Australia to achieve its prescribed GHG emissions mitigation target. While the ERF may encourage mitigation of GHG emissions generally, it is unlikely to lead to substantial mitigation of GHG emissions from agricultural or forestry activities, or encourage sustainable land use practices in Australia: the ERF is a win-win for GHG emitters in this sector. In order to achieve both of these objectives in the land sector, the paper argues that the direct financial assistance provided by the ERF must be complemented by a carbon pricing mechanism, such as a carbon tax. This issue is explored by asking two key questions. First, why is the ERF unlikely to lead to any substantial mitigation of GHG emissions in the land sector, or support sustainable land use practices in Australia? Second, how can linking the ERF to a carbon tax, improve the likelihood of achieving tangible mitigation of GHG emissions and sustainable land use practices in Australia’s land sector?","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Traditional policy evaluations have assessed the performance of individual policy instruments, applying criteria such as target effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, legitimacy and distributional effects. More recently there has been a shift of interest in how policy instruments interact and the role of the policy mix. There is growing recognition that it is difficult to design ‘optimal’ policy solutions, and that the existence of multiple market failures implies that a wider mix of policy approaches are required in order to overcome them. Therefore, more effort is devoted to finding suitable ‘policy packages’, where the instruments work in synergy and inconsistencies are minimized. While carbon pricing policies have often been considered the best option for cutting carbon emissions in the most cost-effective way, this is increasingly questioned. For instance, mandatory regulations offer certain benefits relative to pricing, which could include: (1) they send a clear signal to industries, and provide more information than price signals which are often too diffused, resulting in decisions constrained by bounded rationality; (2) they may have lower transaction costs, as transaction costs are quite high, especially in emission trading schemes; and (3) they may overcome market and behavioural failures such as information asymmetries and computational constraints affecting the transmission and analysis of information, leading to sub-optimal decisions among societal actors. As experience with carbon pricing has also demonstrated, there are political economy constraints with carbon pricing that result in far less effective pricing policies than theory would suggest. Some authors who focus on past technological breakthroughs suggest there is little reason to believe that carbon pricing alone can bring about the technological change needed to significantly reduce emissions. It should also be recognized that the choice of policy instruments is influenced by political and discursive struggles concerning the nature of the problem and its solutions: some actors view climate change mainly as a market failure issue to be corrected by carbon pricing; others primarily consider climate change to be an energy system challenge requiring the decarbonizing of societal systems.","[""abstract""]"

The evidence suggests that, while climate policies are likely to have a modest impact on aggregate employment, workers in certain regions and industries can be more severely affected. The transition may also have gender-differentiated impacts: men represent the largest share of the workforce of most negatively affected industries (e.g. coal-mining) while the growth of the renewable power generation sector, which exhibits a relatively more gender-balanced workforce, suggests that female employment may increase in the traditionally male-dominated energy sector. Lessons from the case-studies underline that a suite of polices is necessary to manage the structural adjustment process, including structural reforms and skills policies. Importantly, the low-carbon transition differentiates itself from previous restructuring experiences because of its policy-driven nature and the possibility to finance structural adjustment measures through carbon-pricing revenues.","[""abstract""]"

China has decided to use more market-based instruments to develop a low-carbon economy (LCE). By 2013, seven pilot carbon emission trading systems (ETS) will be implemented and a national wide ETS will follow by 2016. Existing experiences have shown that the carbon cost pass-through in the electricity sector to downstream sectors is of crucial role to deliver effective GHG emission reduction. This is of particular interest for China’s electricity industry which is dominated by coal. However, China’s electricity market is still regulated and this entails challenges for ensuring carbon cost pass-through in its electricity price. China’s reform toward a competitive electricity market has not been successful so far and needs further works on legal framework and effective institutions. China’s electricity price still remains controlled by the government and there are an important number of institutional barriers which hinder further electricity market price reform. 
 
Before discussing the feasibility of carbon cost pass-through in the electricity price, we need robust quantitative assessments of the impacts of carbon cost pass-through in electricity price in China. This paper provides a complementary study which focuses on the macro impacts of different options of carbon cost pass-through in the electricity price by using the SIC-GE model, a CGE model of the State Information Center of China.

These countries have made commitments Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), in some cases contingent on financing by developed countries, to limit or reduce their Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through a variety of measures including more significant deployment of renewable power, energy efficiency, land-use controls such as conservation of forests and grasslands, carbon pricing, and other measures compatible with each country’s national circumstances and capabilities. Even with full ratification of the Agreement by all 197 signatories, the aggregate effect is projected only to slow the rate of GHG emissions growth from the 24 percent increase, between 1990 and 2010, to an anticipated increase between 2010 and 2030 of between 11 and 23 percent. To foster higher ambition and sustainable development, and also encourage large-scale financing towards the most effective mitigation measures, Article 6 of the Agreement recognizes that countries may engage in cooperative approaches, including the use of internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) towards their individual NDC. In this new, complex and diverse environment, this paper aims to examine emerging digital technologies and architectures that could be used to enhance and connect the heterogeneous climate actions across countries, thereby supporting post-2020 climate markets that facilitate the most cost-effective achievement of the highest possible ambition. Given the speed with which information technology, system architectures, domestic policy, and other relevant elements are developing, the roadmap laid out in this paper will likely continue to evolve significantly over the next few years.","[""abstract""]"

Comparison of Model Estimates for 2020","2009","22","Robust quantification of the future potentials and costs for mitigating greenhouse gases in different countries could provide important information to the current negotiations on a post-2012 climate agreement. However, such information is not readily available from statistical sources, but requires the use of complex models that combine economic, technological and social aspects. In March 2009, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) invited leading modelling teams to a comparison of available model estimates of GHG mitigation potentials and costs in the Annex I countries for the year 2020. Eight modelling teams provided input to this comparison exercise. 
 
 
 
Although at face value estimates of mitigation potentials and costs show wide variation across models differences (i) in assumptions on the baseline economic development, (ii) in the definition of which mitigation measures are considered part of the baseline, and (iii) in the time window assumed for the implementation of mitigation measures explain much of the variation in model results. The paper presents a check-list of factors that need to be considered when interpreting model results. 
 
 
 
Once corrected for these key factors, two clusters of cost curves emerge for the year 2020: Models that include consumer demand changes and macro-economic feedbacks agree on a mitigation potential of up to 40% reduction below 2005 levels (that is approximately 45% below the 1990 level) for total Annex I emissions in 2020 for a carbon price of 50 to 150 US-$/tCO2. Bottom-up models that restrict their analysis to technical measures show only half of this potential. 
 
 
 
The model intercomparison demonstrates that future economic development has a strong impact on the eforts necessary to achieve given emission reduction levels. Any delay in the start of implementation of mitigation measures will reduce the mitigation potential that is achievable in the near term and inrease the costs. The introduction of measures that mobilize demand adjustments through structural or behavioural changes may increase the short-term mitigation potential significantly.","[""abstract""]"

The focus is on the recent highlights from around the world and on key lessons that can be drawn from the growing experience. Despite the difficult ongoing international climate negotiations, there is an increased focus on climate change policy and several economies are planning, implementing or refining domestic mitigation actions. These activities take careful note of past experiences, mirroring successes and dealing with weaknesses. About 40 national and over 20 sub-national jurisdictions are putting a price on carbon. Together these carbon pricing instruments cover almost 6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e), or about 12 percent of the annual global GHG emissions. Cooperation remains a key feature of success The international market has been struggling for some time. However, the current spate of domestic action has been buoyed by growing cooperation among regional, national and sub-national stakeholders. Piloting and scaling up carbon pricing on an international level and increasing climate finance through market-based mechanisms is an important first step. The next challenge will be to create a product that is greater than the sum of its parts by converting fragmented initiatives into internationally integrated carbon pricing approaches.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Carbon sequestration by forestry continues to be an important part of New Zealand’s contribution to its global obligations to reduce emissions. This paper describes the policy changes to the NZ ETS since 2008 that directly affect forestry; assesses the effectiveness of the scheme; explores who is benefiting from it; and outlines issues facing forestry in the NZ ETS moving forward. We find that forest owners have responded to the financial incentives from the NZ ETS in a rational way. Both afforestation and deforestation decisions appear to have been influenced by the emissions price and/or expectations about the emissions price in the future. However, the scheme has been beset by challenges. The collapse in the global carbon price and, associated with this, the proliferation of international Kyoto credits of questionable environmental integrity, combined with the government decision to delay New Zealand’s delink from international markets until 2015, greatly reduced the price signal for forestry from the NZ ETS from 2012 to 2015. A weak price signal, coupled with ongoing policy uncertainty surrounding the NZ ETS, has limited the effectiveness of the scheme in achieving its forestry goals. Prospects going forward are more positive particularly if the current reform of the ETS can create clear predictable price signals and better manage the complexity of forestry rewards and liabilities, particularly as faced by smaller landowners who are not professional foresters but could potentially participate and reforest.","[""abstract""]"

In this study, a multiscale ensemble forecasting model integrating empirical mode decomposition (EMD), genetic algorithm (GA) and artificial neural network (ANN) is proposed to forecast carbon price. Firstly, the proposed model uses EMD to decompose carbon price data into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residue. Then, the IMFs and residue are composed into a high frequency component, a low frequency component and a trend component which have similar frequency characteristics, simple components and strong regularity using the fine-to-coarse reconstruction algorithm. Finally, those three components are predicted using an ANN trained by GA, i.e., a GAANN model, and the final forecasting results can be obtained by the sum of these three forecasting results. For verification and testing, two main carbon future prices with different maturity in the European Climate Exchange (ECX) are used to test the effectiveness of the proposed multiscale ensemble forecasting model. Empirical results obtained demonstrate that the proposed multiscale ensemble forecasting model can outperform the single random walk (RW), ARIMA, ANN and GAANN models without EMD preprocessing and the ensemble ARIMA model with EMD preprocessing.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Therefore, there is a need for decision support tools to objectively determine the value of investments, considering the impacts on different groups of actors, and the risks linked to uncertainties. We present a new open-source hydroeconomic optimization model, linking in a holistic framework, representations of the water, agriculture, and power systems. The model represents the joint development of nexus-related infrastructure and policies and evaluates their 15 economic impact, as well as the risks linked to uncertainties in future climate and socio-economic development. We apply the methodology in the Zambezi River Basin, a major African basin shared by eight countries, in which multiple investment opportunities exist, including new hydropower plants, new or resized reservoirs, development of irrigation agriculture, and investments into the power grid. We show that the linkage of the different systems is crucial to evaluate impacts of climate change and socio-economic development, which will ultimately influence investment decisions. We find that climate change 20 could induce economic losses up to 2.3 billion dollars per year on the current system. We show that the value of the hydropower development plan is sensitive to future fuel prices, carbon pricing policies, the capital cost of solar technologies, and climate change. Similarly, we show that the value of the irrigation development plan is sensitive to the evolution of crop yields, world market crop prices and climate change.

We identify a structural break occurred on the carbon spot price series in October 2008, which is mainly resulting from the financial and economic crisis. We find that the price of carbon does not matter for electricity prices in either countries before October 2008. Electricity producers in both countries were facing uncertainties regarding the future of the EU ETS and thus adopted a wait and see attitude until the end of 2008. The communication of national allocation plans (NAPs) in late October 2008, and the definitive adoption of the European Union climate and energy package by the European Parliament in December 2008 puts an end to these uncertainties. We find also that after October 2008, electricity producers in both countries were constrained to include the carbon price in their cost functions. During that period, French electricity producers were more constrained than their German counterparts, the elasticity of the electricity price relative to the price of carbon being higher in France than in Germany. By comparing the results with those in Kirat and Ahamada [2011] concerning the first phase of the EU ETS we conclude that the changes in the EU ETS introduced in phase II (banking and lower allowances in NAPs) have rendered the carbon market more efficient. Finally, we find a higher conditional correlation between wholesale electricity prices in France and Germany during the second phase of the EU ETS reflecting more integrated French and German electricity markets.","[""abstract""]"

Recent experience certainly suggests that the two ambitions can clash awkwardly unless very carefully handled. For example, the European Union and its member states have become increasingly determined to address climate change issues and to set, and hopefully, reach new and demanding targets for reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Very strong speeches have been made both by German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and by the British Prime Minister Tony Blair in favour of new carbon goals, well beyond the Kyoto benchmarks, and for higher percentages of renewable, low-carbon, energy sources as a percentage of total EU energy consumption. But in formulating these new aims Europe's leaders have also encountered new controversies, both amongst the member states and between richer and poorer societies worldwide. First, several member states, when faced with sweeping new pan-European proposals for limiting emissions, for raising the penalties for exceeding carbon limits and for sharply reducing fossil-fuel use, have hastened to point out their very different and varied local circumstances and energy needs. The EU of 25 members today is not the smaller and more uniform EU of yesterday, with 15 members or less. Today, with the accession states of Central and Eastern Europe in the club per capita income disparities are far larger, in a ratio of 24 to 1 between rich Luxembourg and newcomer Bulgaria. What richer countries can absorb and are eager to commit to, in the way of carbon pricing and other moves to internalise previously external costs, will be far from the liking of poorer and less mature economies. Furthermore, while the stronger and larger economies of Western Europe may be prepared, for the sake of curbing greenhouse gases, to shoulder the burden of more expensive energy from renewable sources, in some case with cost profiles well above current commercial levels, the same extra costs could be far more difficult to bear in the poorer member states. These divergences of interest have duly been reflected in difficult negotiations in Brussels as officials have struggled to find a formula, which will combine tough sounding targets with enough flexibility to accommodate all 25 member states.

We assess the macroeconomic effects of deploying low carbon technologies in six energy intensive industrial sectors (Petroleum, Iron and Steel, Non-metallic Minerals, Paper and Pulp, Chemicals, and Electricity) in Europe, China and India in 2030. By combining the GAINS technology model with a macroeconomic computable general equilibrium model, we find that output in energy intensive industries declines in Europe by 6% in total, while output increases in China by 11% and in India by 13%. The opposite output effects emerge because low carbon technologies lead to cost savings in China and India but not in Europe. Consequently, the competitiveness of energy intensive industries is improved in China and India relative to Europe, leading to higher exports to Europe. In all regions, the decarbonization of electricity plays the dominant role for mitigation. We find a rebound effect in China and India, in the size of 42% and 34% CO 2 reduction, respectively, but not in Europe. Our results indicate that the range of considered low-carbon technology options is not competitive in the European industrial sectors. To foster breakthrough low carbon technologies and maintain industrial competitiveness, targeted technology policy is therefore needed to supplement carbon pricing.","[""abstract""]"

Many experts regard a uniform carbon price that covers all energy sources as the most efficient approach to achieving this ambitious goal. Most European countries, however, are not pursuing this approach consistently and neither is Germany. While steps have already been taken in the right direction, the current system of levies and charges still contains price distortions that hamper the integration of renewables and the intended sector coupling. This is generally increasing the cost of the energy transition in Germany and making it difficult to achieve climate targets. The core elements of a reform might consist of a floor price under the EU ETS and a CO2-oriented amendment to energy taxation. Transnational coordination is also conceivable here. In addition, the measures would have to be revenue-neutral so that they place no additional net burden on households and industry.

Conversely, public finance typically overlooks the effects of future decarbonization efforts when devising instruments for the major goals of fiscal policy. We argue that such a compartmentalisation is undesirable: policy design taking into account such interdependencies may enhance welfare and change the distribution of mitigation costs within and across generations. This claim is substantiated by analyzing six interactions between climate policy and public finance that are insufficiently explored in current research: (i) reduced tax competition in an open economy, (ii) portfolio effects induced through climate policy, (iii) restructuring public spending, (iv) revenue recycling for productive public investment, (v) greater intragenerational equity through appropriate revenue recycling and (vi) intergenerational Pareto-improvements through intertemporal transfers.

The reason is that carbon is a global pollutant, so a ton of carbon emitted in Beijing contributes to climate change just as much as a ton of carbon emitted in New York.

We propose a new indicator which is called “optimal return rate” to facilitate determining the sector coverage. The sector with a low optimal return rate should be given high priority to be imposed low carbon policy and vice versa. We also conduct a numerical simulation using China’s real data to calculate optimal return rates of China’s sectors. Simulation results show that most energy-intensive sectors have quite low optimal return rates and should be first included in either emission trading scheme or carbon tax scheme. Moreover, sectors included in the first stage of building China’s national carbon emission trading scheme are also in accordance with our simulation results.

Different strategies are investigated for the construction industry to become circular as it is a major player concerning resource consumption, both energy and material related. One of these strategies focusses on qualitative re-use of building components and building materials. To assess the circularity of different re-use scenarios of building components and materials, we developed and applied a circularity assessment concept in the European Urban Innovation Actions (UIA) project 'Super Circular Estate' (Superlocal). In this project, a 10-floor high 100-appartment building block is deconstructed and its components are re-used in new building objects; 1 pavilion, 4 detached dwellings with different floor areas and 12 terraced dwellings. In the model the environmental impact of different circularity scenarios is expressed in embodied energy, embodied CO2, and carbon pricing. Besides the material and energy aspects, other qualities and former social structures are re-used within the project area, boosting the local economy and creating a high-quality and desirable urban environment, resulting in Europe's first super circular housing estate. In the baseline, the existing apartment block consists of 2.3E03 GJ embodied energy and 2.9E03 tons of embodied CO2. The investigated pilot dwelling consists of 3.35E02 GJ embodied energy, of which 65% is embodied in re-used materials, and 4.62E01 tons of embodied CO2, of which 90% is embodied in re-used materials.

Here, green innovation is measured as patented ideas of the following technology categories: i) reductions of greenhouse gas emissions related to energy generation, transmission or distribution; ii) climate change mitigation technologies related to buildings and iii) climate change mitigation technologies for the production or processing of goods. After 2005, there was clear growth in green innovation and an expansion of markets for energy from renewable sources. The development paths of the countries differ due to the different production structures and policies adopted. Our empirical analysis suggests that the adoption of white certificate schemes promoting end-user energy savings has facilitated the generation of green innovation. The data provide further support for the positive relationship between the stringency of fossil fuel taxation and green innovation. The literature further suggests that carbon pricing and R&D subsidies are complementary policies. R&D subsidies play a substantial role in the early stages of the transition towards clean technologies. For mature technologies, the certificate system may serve as a cost-efficient means to fulfill renewable energy obligations. Renewable energy policies also tend to be more effective in countries with liberalized energy markets. Competition and policy actions that lower entry barriers enhance green innovation.

However, estimating such emissions and sinks remains challenging, and thus making it impossible to estimate carbon revenues from managing tropical forests. Here, we estimated the reduced emissions and sinks by developing models for setting Reference Emission Level (REL) and Project Emission Level (PEL) for REDD projects in concession forests taking emissions under conventional logging (CVL) scenario as that of REL, and emissions under reduced impact logging (RIL) and RIL with liberation treatment (RIL) scenarios as that of PEL. By choosing Cambodia as a case study, REL under the current logging system of 25-year cutting cycle was estimated at 23.1 TgCO2 year-1. To determine an appropriate cutting cycle, we tested our models with four cutting cycles and found that a 50-year cutting cycle is more appropriate. Taking this 50-year cutting cycle for REDD project, PELs were estimated at 0.4 TgCO2 and -3.3 TgCO2 year-1 under RIL and RIL, respectively (- means sinks). After subtracting REL with PEL and leakages, annual carbon credits from managing 3.4 million ha of concession forests in Cambodia were estimated at 15.9-18.5 TgCO2 depending on chosen scenario. With a carbon price of $5 MgCO2-1, total revenues from the sales of carbon credits alone are $79.5-92.5 million annually. To ensure continued flow of wood supply from tropical forests while mitigating climate change, we suggest that new climate agreements adopt RIL or RIL for sustainable forest management in tropical countries.","[""abstract""]"

At the same time, livestock is an invaluable source of nutrition and livelihood for millions of poor people. Therefore, climate mitigation policies involving livestock must be designed with extreme care. Here we demonstrate the large mitigation potential inherent in the heterogeneity of livestock production systems. We find that even within existing systems, autonomous transitions from extensive to more productive systems would decrease GHG emissions and improve food availability. Most effective climate policies involving livestock would be those targeting emissions from land-use change. To minimize the economic and social cost, policies should target emissions at their source—on the supply side—rather than on the demand side. Livestock are responsible for 12% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable intensification of livestock production systems might become a key climate mitigation technology. However, livestock production systems vary substantially, making the implementation of climate mitigation policies a formidable challenge. Here, we provide results from an economic model using a detailed and high-resolution representation of livestock production systems. We project that by 2030 autonomous transitions toward more efficient systems would decrease emissions by 736 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (MtCO2e⋅y−1), mainly through avoided emissions from the conversion of 162 Mha of natural land. A moderate mitigation policy targeting emissions from both the agricultural and land-use change sectors with a carbon price of US$10 per tCO2e could lead to an abatement of 3,223 MtCO2e⋅y−1. Livestock system transitions would contribute 21% of the total abatement, intra- and interregional relocation of livestock production another 40%, and all other mechanisms would add 39%. A comparable abatement of 3,068 MtCO2e⋅y−1 could be achieved also with a policy targeting only emissions from land-use change. Stringent climate policies might lead to reductions in food availability of up to 200 kcal per capita per day globally. We find that mitigation policies targeting emissions from land-use change are 5 to 10 times more efficient—measured in “total abatement calorie cost”—than policies targeting emissions from livestock only. Thus, fostering transitions toward more productive livestock production systems in combination with climate policies targeting the land-use change appears to be the most efficient lever to deliver desirable climate and food availability outcomes.","[""abstract""]"

Prices of $25 and $50 per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions cause electricity emissions reductions of 17% and 22% from present levels, respectively. This suggests significant electricity sector emissions reductions can be achieved quickly from a modest carbon tax, and diminishing reductions occur when increasing from $25 to $50. The model captures short run effects via operational changes at existing U.S. power plants, mostly by switching production from coal to natural gas. A state-level analysis yields the following conclusions: (1) states which reduce the most emissions are high coal-consumers in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, (2) 15 states increase emissions after carbon policy because they increase natural gas consumption to offset coal consumption decreases in neighboring states, and (3) a flat per-capita rebate of tax revenue leads to wealth transfers across states.","[""abstract""]"

Withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol on International Emission Trading","2002","0","The U.S. decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol changes dramatically the prospects on the actual working of the international markets for carbon emissions. When the U.S. participate in Kyoto, according to most evaluations, the equilibrium price of permits in 2010 is expected to be in the range of 50 to 100 US$. Without the U.S., it would be considerably smaller, even close to zero in some modeling scenarios. This reflects the fact that the emission credits allocated in excess to Russia and other CIS countries (hot air) will be approximately enough to satisfy the potential demand by the remaining Annex B regions, even if the U.S. implement a modest domestic abatement policy. In such a context, it is very likely that the Former Soviet Union (FSU) adopts a monopolistic behavior, that is to restrict the supply of permits in order to maximize its revenues from permits sales. Even before the recent U.S. decision, the possibility and the outcome of a monopolistic behavior by FSU have been analyzed and assessed through Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. However, most of the studies are based on a short-run or “myopic” approach, without consideration of the possible gains accruing from banking emissions rights, either for domestic use or for sale. In this paper, we adopt an inter-temporal approach, which is subject to several uncertainties concerning both the short term, in particular the competition from other flexibility mechanisms, and the long run (i.e. economic growth, technological change, and the future of the Kyoto Protocol). Using an optimization mathematical program calibrated on two CGE models (EPPA and GEMINI-E3), the paper shows that carbon prices are relatively unsensitive to FSU’s behaviors when the U.S. is assumed to participate. It also shows that the impacts of market power by FSU is largely dependent on the elasticity of permits demand when the U.S. have no emissions constraint. Finally, we focus on the uncertainty about the supply of CDM by developing countries. It is shown that permits prices are relatively unsensitive to CDM supply in the short run but not in the long run.","[""abstract""]"

RCP (Representative Concentration Pathways) 2.6 is one of them and the summation of all countriesâ€TM emissions submitted as INDC (Intended Nationally Determined Contributions) is expected to be larger than RCP2.6 in 2030. To achieve the 2 degree target, additional emission reduction is needed to fill the gap between them after 2030. Such mitigation scenario consistent with INDC and achieving the 2 degree target would have different mitigation costs spatially and temporally, and influence on the generation equity both in intraand intergenerations. Here, we have the three research questions, namely 1) for inter-generation equity, does INDC cause more harm to the future generation comparing with RCP2.6? 2) For intra-generation equity, if we follow INDC pledges, would we gain more intra-generation equity? 3) Would it help to improve generation equity regarding mitigation costs if we could have more stringent reduction target than INDC? This study answers these questions using the AIM/CGE (Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/ Computable General Equilibrium) model, which is a recursive dynamic general equilibrium model that covers all regions of the world. GTAP and energy balance table are used as a basis of the SAM and energy balance table and reconciled them with other international statistics such as national accounts. The data in the year 2005 is used as the base year calibration data. GHG emissions are calibrated to EDGAR4.2. The following four scenarios were analyzed: BAU, 26W, 26W_INDC and 26W_S_INDC. The BAU entails no emissions constraints and follows current trends in energy technologies. The 26W scenario has emissions constraints that approximately meet the emission target in RCP 2.6. It uses a uniform global carbon price to achieve the emission target. 26W_INDC scenario also meets the radiative forcing target approximately achieves 2.8 W/m2 in 2100 (not 2.6 but it is close enough considering temperature changes) and INDC pledges are satisfied before 2030 and a uniform global carbon price is assumed thereafter. 26W_S_INDC scenario is similar to 26W_INDC scenario except that each countryâ€TMs INDC emission target increases by 10 percent compared to 26W_INDC. The socioeconomic assumptions behind of all three scenarios follow SSP2 socioeconomic assumptions. The target period of assessment is 2020 to 2100. To make current and future mitigation costs comparable, we introduce discount rate. The discount rates are decided using the following function (a). Î ́ is the pure rate of time preference for the present. g(t,r) is the GDP growth rate in region r and time t. Î·(r) represents inequality aversion in region r. Previous studies often assign a value ranging from 1 to 2 for inequality aversion. Ï•(t,r) is the discount rate in time t for region r. Ï•(t,r)=Î ́+Î·(r) * g(t,r) (a) We get GDP loss results as mitigation costs in the above scenarios from AIM/CGE model. To analyze inter-generation equity, we divide the year 2020 to 2100 into two generations. Current generation is 2020 to 2060. Future generation is 2060 to 2100. Then, we compared NPV (Net Present Value) of GDP losses in the scenarios. For intra-generation equity analysis, we focused on the relationship between the GDP loss rate and GDP per capita across regions in different years as well as using NPV of GDP loss rate as average values. The results show that 26W_INDC has low mitigation cost in the former period, but high in the latter period comparing with 26W. Therefore, if we use ordinal number 2.0 as the inequality aversion parameter, 26W shows better inter-generation than 26W_INDC. More than 2.66 in the inequality","[""abstract""]"

We find the majority of provincial pricing systems meet or exceed the federal benchmark. Our results also point to the importance of additional complementary policies to address significant sources of unpriced emissions, primarily in agriculture and fugitive sources.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This paper carries out a systematic assessment on the sensitivity of Computable General Equilibrium models to technological and geographical scales in evaluating the economic impacts of carbon mitigation policies. Taking Italy as an example, we find that the estimation for carbon price and the economic cost of a de-carbonization pathway by means of a model with technological and regional details can be lower than a model without such details by up to 40%. Additionally, the effect of representing regional details appears to be far more important than the effect of representing the details of electricity technology in both the estimated carbon prices and the estimated economic impacts. Our results for Italy highlight the importance of modeling uncertainties of these two key assumptions, which should be appropriately acknowledged when applying CGE models for policy impact assessment. Our conclusions can be generalized to different countries and policy scenarios not in terms of absolute numbers but in terms of economic explanations.

In the absence of these conditions, long term subsidy mechanisms would need to continue in order to meet European renewable electricity targets. More VRE production will exacerbate the ‘missing money’ problem for conventional generation.

We propose a carbon pricing model linked to crude oil prices, which has historically been employed in supply-side driven pricing of long-term contracts for early-stage energy trading. Since the model is designed to hold carbon prices between certain lower and upper boundaries using S-shaped carbon price linkage to crude oil prices, it can be useful to overcome a recent low carbon price issue. In addition, it is shown that the model can alleviate the difficulties of carbon derivative pricing in selecting market price of risk. Empirical studies using EUA and Brent crude oil futures prices estimate the parameters of the Brent crude oil-linked EUA price model. The comparison of EUA prices simulated from the model with historical EUA prices suggests that simulated EUA prices be kept relatively higher than historical EUA prices. This is preferable for accelerating carbon emission reductions in that it can make emission reduction technologies with high marginal abatement costs affordable. It may imply that EUA must be priced using a crude oil-linked carbon price model in the early stage of EUA trading until EUA markets mature. This is a sharp contrast to current carbon markets employing premature market-based or supply and demand based pricing models. To show usefulness of crude oil-linked carbon pricing, we also give a numerical example of European carbon option pricing based on the Brent crude oil-linked EUA price model by using the Crank-Nicolson finite difference method. Finally we discuss the relation between crude oil-linked carbon pricing and emission reduction risk. These studies may suggest carbon policy makers should take account of crude oil-linked carbon pricing to tackle low price and low liquidity issues of carbon assets.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Concern over possible carbon leakage in this sector poses a major challenge for designing effective carbon pricing instruments (CPI). Different methodologies for assessing carbon leakage exposure are currently used by different jurisdictions, each of them based on different approaches and indicators. This paper aims to analyse the extent to which the use of different methodologies leads to different results in terms of exposure to the risk of carbon leakage, using the Brazilian industry sector as a case study. Results indicate that carbon leakage exposure is an expected outcome of eventual CPI implementation in Brazilian industry. However, results vary according to the chosen methodology, so the definition of the criteria is paramount for assessing sectoral exposure to the risk of carbon leakage. Key policy insights Despite increasing discussion about the implementation of carbon pricing on the Brazilian industrial sector, the evaluation of carbon leakage risks is still neglected. Assessments of the risk of carbon leakage are directly related to the indicators and criteria used by each methodology. Thus, a given subsector may present different levels of exposure to carbon leakage depending on the methodological choice. More than a purely technical discussion, the methodological definition of carbon leakage risk is a political discussion – it can be well-conducted, leading to the success of a CPI, or even sabotaged, by implicitly subsidizing energy-intensive industries.","[""abstract""]"

As the world’s eighth-largest economy and the only state in the U.S. to implement a comprehensive program of regulatory and market-based mechanisms to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, California represents an important site of inquiry. The passage of Assembly Bill 32, the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 has made the state a global leader on climate change science and policy innovation. While no subnational government can halt climate change alone, California’s environmental policies have a long history of success and replication. Through an extensive analysis of the state’s climate policies and interviews with key stakeholders, this dissertation highlights the challenges California faces in influencing global climate policy while addressing the needs of local communities that are already adversely impacted by air pollution. As cities and public agencies appropriate leadership roles in climate governance, policy formulation is increasingly emerging as an expert-driven process that emphasizes global GHG reductions as the goal and geographically-neutral economic and technological fixes as the solution. In this process, community-based strategies that integrate climate change interventions with population health outcomes are often excluded. This dissertation asks how environmental justice advocates are engaging strategically in the policymaking process in order to legitimize or contest regulatory policies regarding climate change in the face of ongoing pollution, illness, and injustice. In answering this question, the dissertation centers on three areas of inquiry: (1) the public health and environmental justice aspects of municipal climate action plans; (2) the conflict over statewide carbon pricing and use of its revenue for investment in communities most impacted by air pollution; and, (3) the social implications of international forest carbon-offset projects allowable under California’s market-based climate change law. These cases provide critical insights into environmental inequities and the emerging epistemologies of climate change on multiple scales. The dissertation findings demonstrate that the implementation of climate policies can either serve to exacerbate or redress underlying environmental health inequities in urban communities. In particular, these cases highlight the environmental justice strategies that are challenging a priori policy expertise to produce new local, place-based conceptualizations of climate change that underscore population health and community well-being.","[""abstract""]"

Therefore, the determination of additionality of activities under the market mechanisms of its Article 6 will need to be revisited. This paper provides recommendations on how to operationalize additionality under Article 6. We first review generic definitions of additionality and current approaches for testing of additionality before discussing under which conditions additionality testing of specific activities or policies is still necessary under the new context of the Paris Agreement, that is, in order to prevent increases of global emissions. We argue that the possibility of ‘hot air’ generation under nationally-determined contributions (NDCs) requires an independent check of the NDC’s ambition. If the NDC of the transferring country does contain ‘hot air’, or if the transferred emission reductions are not covered by the NDC, a dedicated additionality test should be required. While additionality tests of projects and programmes could continue to be done through investment analysis, for policy instruments new approaches are required. They should be differentiated according to type of policy instrument. For regulation, we suggest calculating the resulting pay-back period for technology users. If the regulation generates investments exceeding a payback period threshold, it could be deemed additional. Similarly, carbon pricing policies that generate a carbon price exceeding a threshold could qualify; for trading schemes an absence of over-allocation needs to be shown. The threshold should be differentiated according to country categories and rise over time. Key policy insights Without additionality testing, market mechanisms under the Paris Agreements might lead to an international diffusion of ‘hot air’. To avoid this, an independent assessment of NDC ambition is in order. Otherwise, activities under the mechanisms need to undergo specific additionality tests. Additionality testing of projects and programmes should build on the experience developed under the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms. Bold approaches are needed for assessing additionality of policies. To avoid cumbersome assessment of all activities triggered by such policies, highly aggregated approaches are suggested, ranging from payback period thresholds for technologies mandated by regulation to minimum price levels triggered by carbon pricing policies. Over time, the stringency of threshold values should increase.","[""abstract""]"

Decarbonizing China’s power sector will shape how the country and to a large extent the world uses energy and addresses pollution and climate change. Combining methods of GIS modeling and wind and solar capacity factor simulation, this study utilized 200 representative locations each independently for wind and solar, with 10 years of hourly wind speed and solar irradiation data to investigate provincial capacity and output potentials from 2001 to 2010, and to build wind and solar availability profiles. This study then examined the implications of the solar and wind variability and availability in the context of an overall energy strategy for China by using a system optimization model: SWITCH-China to analyze the feasibility, costs and benefits of China’s clean power transition under three key policy scenarios: Reference Scenario, Low Cost Renewable Scenario, and Carbon Cap Scenario. By optimizing capacity expansion and hourly generation dispatch simultaneously, SWITCH-China is uniquely suited to explore both the value of and synergies among various power system technology options, providing policymakers and industry leaders with important information about the optimal development of the electricity grid. China’s power sector is in the midst of fast development, and today’s investment decisions will have a large impact on the country’s ability to achieve its environmental and carbon mitigation goals. Concerted actions are needed to enable such a transition, including introducing a meaningful carbon price, coordinating the investment decisions, and building the necessary infrastructure for moving energy around.","[""abstract""]"

This study analyses future steel production globally, with focus on the rising availability of steel scrap, and implications for steel production capacity planning. We evaluate the development of steel demand, using the Steel Optimization Model, which provides a regiondetailed representation of technologies, energy and material flows and trade activities. We link it to the Scrap Availability Assessment Model, which estimates the theoretical steel scrap availability. The modelling horizon stretches until 2100, with 2050 serving as a benchmark for the analysis. The scenarios require a range of inputs to estimate regional pathways for steel demand including demographic development and economic growth, and these affect scrap availability. The results show that aggregated crude steel production will evolve into an almost balanced split between the primary production route using iron ore and secondary production from steel scrap by 2050 and the share of EAF will exceed by 2060 the production in BOF globally. The results also show a global increase in scrap use from 611 Mtonnes in 2015 to 1.5 Gtonnes in 2050, with highest growth being for post-consumer scrap. In 2050, almost 50 % of post-consumer scrap is expected to be traded, with the main exporter being China and major importing regions being Africa, India and other developing Asian countries. Surprisingly, the increase in scrap use does not depend much on the introduction of a global carbon price until 2050. The results are important for producers contemplating new investments, since regional availability, quality and trade patterns of scrap will influence production route choices, possibly in favor of secondary routes. Also policy instruments such as carbon taxation may affect investment choices, and favor more energy eficient and less carbon-intensive emerging technologies.","[""abstract""]"

By 2025 the aim is to have 90% of electricity generated from renewable resources including between 20-30% generated from wind (Electricity Authority (EA), 2010). Electricity generation expansion scenarios that would achieve these targets also include significant geo-thermal build which is classed as “must run” base load and offered into the spot-market at a price of zero, as is wind and must run hydro such as run of river. Thus the renewable electricity generation scenarios for New Zealand will likely include large amounts of electricity offered into the spot market at a price of zero much of which is intermittent. The New Zealand Electricity Authority models generation expansion scenarios based on: expected demand; fuel and carbon prices; a merit order using long run marginal costs; combined with various constraints including security of supply constraints. However the Generation Expansion Model (EA, 2010) does not model actual price formation. The first aim of this work is to model price formation to understand the impact of large amounts of intermittent wind on the electricity market. Prices are expected to become much more volatile as thermal plants can only recover their fixed costs by capturing higher prices when they are running. There are some suggestions that market power will exacerbate this (Green and Vasilokas ,2010). Volatile prices change the risk profile and investment incentives for new generation especially for capital intensive generation such as wind. A further consideration for a market such as New Zealand, which has locational pricing, is the impact of wind and intermittency on the grid. In particular attractive wind farm sites tend to be geographically proximate which may lead to line congestion and large variations in nodal prices. Thus we also investigate the incentives to site wind in places where the power is needed (rather than where it can be generated most efficiently). Spot prices may well be zero for a significant fraction of the time. It is not clear that the generation scenarios with large amounts of renewable generation will result in market prices that allow for cost recovery. There may well be a missing money problem which means less investment and a lower than desired security of supply security – a trend which may be exacerbated by change in the risk profile discussed above. The rise of intermittent generation in electricity markets has given rise to a renewed interest in capacity markets for security of supply, driven by the underlying assumption that the increased price volatility caused by intermittent generation will not provide sufficient revenue to incentivize construction of peaking generators sufficient to ensure security of supply. The growth of intermittent generation such as Wind and Solar in electricity markets requires increased investment in peaking capacity to ensure security of supply. In ‘Energy Only’ electricity markets such as New Zealand’s, these investments are made on the basis of the expected revenue peakers generate on the spot market in periods of high demand. It is well known that in the short term at least the merit order effect will depress average prices. Hence an ongoing concern is that energy only markets cannot guarantee sufficient investment in peak capacity to ensure security of supply. However, this assumption has not been well tested in the academic literature with any degree of rigour. Another issue that is starting to emerge is the ability for firms to exercise market power during periods of low wind. In this paper, we use an agent-based model combined with a generation expansion model of the New Zealand (energy only) electricity market to determine a long run equilibrium capacity mix and examine the interaction between long run capacity mix, the merit order effect and market power as wind penetration increases dramatically.","[""abstract""]"

The analysis was carried out as part of a larger project exploring the possibility of using the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to reduce transportation GHG emissions in Santiago de Chile. The paper provides an overview of the analytical approach, which includes an integrated travel demand model with sensitivity to mesolevel land use variations, a method to generate optimal land use scenarios with regards to emission reductions, and a process to estimate the level of subsidies needed to produce those land use scenarios. Limitations to the approach and suggestions for future research are discussed. The paper concludes with an assessment of the results in the face of the fairly strict requirements for project development and implementation implied by the CDM. INTRODUCTION Interest in modifying urban development patterns to influence transportation energy consumption dates back to at least the first global oil crisis of the 1970s (1). Today, energy security risks cont inue while the global climate change risk adds further pressures to reduce transportation energy consumption. While the climate change mitigation burden clearly falls to the world’s industrialized nations, which account for the overwhelming share of accumulated anthropogenic GHG emissions, the rapidly industrializing countries constitute a large and growing share of global emissions (almost 50%, including the countries of Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union; (2)). In February 2005, the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force for signatory countries. The Protocol contains several market-based mechanisms, including the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), which allows industrialized country governme nts or private entities to invest in developing country emission reductions. The industrialized country project “proponent” earns emission reductions – known as Certified Emission Reduction units (CERs) – towards domestic targets while the developing country advances its development goals. Indeed, the Kyoto Protocol specifies that CDM projects must help host countries achieve “sustainable development,” although the Protocol does not specify a definition of the concept. The market value of a CER varies according to the prevailing carbon price and can be influenced by factors such as country and project risk. In Europe the price per tonne of carbon recently exceeded US$20. The majority of CDM projects to date have focused on renewable energy, energy efficiency, and landfill gas projects. As of early 2005, of roughly 1200 CDM projects under development, just over 200 had reached the project design document (PDD) stage. The PDD represents the first step in the CDM process, formally defining the project, estimating emissions reductions, and describing the monitoring plan. Of those 200 projects, just four were transportation projects (3). Transportation remains an important and challenging GHG emissions sector to address: it accounts for approximately 30% of anthropogenic GHG emissions, is growing rapidly, and has highly dispersed emissions sources (e.g., individual vehicles) with few readily available, less carbon-intensive energy substitutes. More broadly, transportation clearly plays an important role in susta inable development. In the case of passenger transportation, for example, transportation provides access to jobs, education, social opportunities, etc. – fundamental to human development. At the same time, however, Donoso, Martínez, Zegras 2 transportation often imposes impacts, in the form of air pollution, accident risk, etc. that pose a serious threat to sustainability. While detailing the numerous CDM project requirements extends beyond the scope of this paper (see 3), three critical CDM-specific aspects bear mentioning here, due to their importance to our analysis: 1. the project baseline, which must represent a defensible vision of future emissions relative to “business-as-usual”; 2. additionality, which refers to the requirement that emissions reductions be additional to what would have taken place in absence of the project; and 3. monitoring and verification, which refers to the need for external monitoring and verification of emission reductions. This paper presents results of an effort to assess the potential of the CDM to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector in Santiago de Chile. The paper analyzes a decidedly behaviorally-based intervention: the possibilities for modifying urban development patterns to reduce GHGs via changes in passenger travel demand. LABTUS (4) presents a more detailed exposition of the theoretical and technical underpinnings of the analysis.. TRANSPORTATION AND THE CDM: WHY LAND USE? This CDM analysis rests on the basic premise that influencing land use patterns produces changes in individual travel behavior, thereby influencing transportation greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs). In contrast to typical CDM projects, this initiative differs in a fundamental way by aiming to change individual behavior. In this sense, the approach faces methodological and implementation hurdles relative to technology-oriented CDM projects, for which estimated GHG emission impacts are (relatively) straightforward to calculate and verify. In the land use case, we expect changes in land use to influence the distances people travel, as well as the relative attractiveness and the occupancy of different modes. Since these effects are behavioral and, in some cases, depend on second order influences, estimating their impacts requires modeling techniques that introduce uncertainties. Despite the challenges, behavioral change may have to play an important role. For example, Heywood et al’s (5) recent assessment of transportation energy consumption under plausible vehicle technological improvements in the US market leads to the “sobering overall conclusion” that technology improvements and reductions in travel growth are critical. For the developing countries, we expect rapid growth in vehicle ownership and use, with expected growth rates in per capita light duty vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) on the order of four to 30 times higher than OECD countries (6). These rapid growth rates signify an important amount of “catching up” – in 2050, per capita VKT in North America will still be 3 times higher than in Latin America (6). While we cannot reasonably expect the developing countries to simply curtail transportation demand, absent a technological “silver bullet” some reduction of VKT growth may well be necessary in both the industrialized and the developing world. This reality leads to an examination of the role of urban structure in reducing VKT growth. Beyond the potential global benefits, efforts to change urban development patterns offer potentially important long-term co-benefits, such as open space preservation, improved air quality and public health, reduced needs for transportation infrastructure investments, etc. In the face of continuing urbanization prospects, interventions in urban structure could bring Donoso, Martínez, Zegras 3 quality of life improvements for nearly 2 billion additional developing country urban dwellers by 2030 (7). Analytical Precedents Land use interventions have long been of interest as a way to influence travel demand, with multiple reviews of relevant analyses carried out over the years (e.g., 1, 8, 9). The multiple studies reveal somewhat wide-ranging estimates of effects, which can be partly attributed to differences in approach (e.g., spatial scale of analysis, analytic technique), the types of built environment measures used, and the effects (e.g., mode choice, trip rate) analyzed. Recent years have seen a push to base the relevant research within more rigorous behavioral theories (e.g., 10) which closely aligns with “traditional” transportation systems analysis (e.g., 11). Most recently, analysts have made the explicit turn to random utility theory-based discrete choice models (e.g., 12). In the late 1960s, several precedents emerged in the form of simulations, looking specifically at the potential for alternative city structure to influence transportation patterns, primarily in the form of experimental analyses of “hypothetical” cities (e.g., 13). Continuing advances in computational power and the 1970s energy crises spurred many analyses of how altering “spatial structure” could reduce transport energy consumption (e.g., 14). These efforts, in most cases, utilized techniques similar to the traditional travel forecasting models (or Lowry-based integrated models), but with the goal of identifying generic, energy efficient, urban forms. The typical result was the heavily CBD-focused city, or the “polynucleated” form (e.g., 15). Relevant, energy use-focused simulations (e.g., 16) as well as empirical analyses (e.g., 17) continued into the 1980s. In more recent years, forecasting models have been applied to real cities to gauge the possibility of using land use strategies for influencing travel demand. In the United States, the pioneering effort was the LUTRAQ project, in the Portland (Oregon) metropolitan area. LUTRAQ utilized integrated land use and travel demand models to assess the possibilities for using alternative urban forms as a possible alternative to developing a new highway (18). Other studies have followed somewhat in the LUTRAQ tradition in the U.S. (e.g., 19, 20). Policy Implications Even if we can confidently predict the influence of land use on travel behaviors, the ability to influence relevant outcomes hinges critically on the institutional and policy setting. The United States experience with local air pollution offers an interesting precedent, in particular the need to ensure state conformity with air quality regulations.

A particular important one is that the “industry is moving from an ́OPEX world ́ into a ́CAPEX world`” (CGSP 2014:91). This increase in capital intensity comes with higher investment risks, because the up-front capital costs are sunk and are not correlated with expected revenues during the operation time (IEA 2014). While there is a stream of literature focusing on investment risks of RE under different support schemes (e.g. Klessmann et al. 2013, Fagiani et al. 2013, Kitzing 2014) and the general impact of high RE shares on the market (e.g. Steggals et al. 2011, Winkler & Altmann 2012), there is so far no study that analyzes numerically how investment risks in a RE dominated market differ from the risks in conventional market. To address this gap, we analyze the investment risk of RE and fossil technologies in a pure market setting without additional “de-risking” measures to compute total investment risks. In addition, it is well known that technologies are affected in a different manner by the same risk factor (like fuel costs, carbon prices etc.) and thus each technology has its own risk pattern (e.g. IEA 2003, Gross et al. 2007). Hence we analyze how risk patterns change in RE compared to fossil fuel dominated markets and how the risk for single technologies and the overall portfolio risk changes with higher RE shares.","[""abstract""]"

The paper identifies a number of existing policies from four key areas – energy/transport, agriculture, sub-soil, and oceans – which will have an impact on three NETs: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), Direct Air Capture (DAC), and terrestrial Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW). We propose that non-climate co-benefits may be valuable in terms of the policy ‘demand pull’ for NETs; in particular, we find that ERW may provide multiple co-benefits which can be mandated through existing policy structures. However, interaction with numerous policy areas may also create barriers, particularly where there is tension between the priorities of different government departments. On the basis of existing and analogous policies from a range of geographical contexts and scales, this paper proposes four options for NETs policy that could be reasonably implemented in the near-term. We also argue that ERW demonstrates the importance of scale and framing, because the policy environment depends on whether it is framed as a soil amendment at local scales or as a climate stabilization technique at international scale. Key policy insights Co-benefits may assist the ‘demand pull’ for novel technologies by providing multiple policy angles for incentivisation rather than relying on a ‘fix-all’ policy such as a high carbon price. DAC with storage might be overly reliant on a high carbon price, because it only provides one core benefit – that of atmospheric carbon reduction. ERW may provide multiple co-benefits which can be mandated through existing policy structures, but should focus on using waste rock rather than mining virgin material. We propose four near-term options for NETs policy: funding for small-scale BECCS demonstration and an international biomass certification mechanism; small-scale loans for ERW on farms and promotion of locally-sourced rock residues; amendment of fertilizer subsidy schemes to include silicate rock; and a clearer framework for licensing sub-soil access for CO2 storage.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This dissertation explores the role that market-based policy instruments can have in advancing the dual goals of rural energy access and sustainable development in the global south. Historic low carbon prices combined with contentious international climate negotiations and an uncertain future for emission trading systems serve as the context for this study, which offers insights for policymakers in structuring future market mechanisms for increasing energy access for the global poor. My findings highlight the important role of nonstate actors in creating predominantly private and voluntary systems of market-based policy initiatives that are only now emerging in the face of faltering international action for climate change in a post-Kyoto Protocol era. Through grounded case studies I examine key assumptions that underlie carbon accounting rules and metrics to understand the consequences for practical monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) under market-based policies. I also present empirical data from household air pollution and fuel consumption measurements from village homes in China to highlight the importance of developing robust monitoring protocols for new technologies prior to inclusion into market-based programs.","[""abstract""]"

The Critical Role of Co-Benefits","2014","18","This paper calculates, for the top twenty emitting countries, how much pricing of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is in their own national interests due to domestic co-benefits (leaving aside the global climate benefits). On average, nationally efficient prices are substantial, $57.5 per ton of CO2 (for year 2010), reflecting primarily health co-benefits from reduced air pollution at coal plants and, in some cases, reductions in automobile externalities (net of fuel taxes/subsidies). Pricing co-benefits reduces CO2 emissions from the top twenty emitters by 13.5 percent (a 10.8 percent reduction in global emissions). However, co-benefits vary dramatically across countries (e.g., with population exposure to pollution) and differentiated pricing of CO2 emissions therefore yields higher net benefits (by 23 percent) than uniform pricing. Importantly, the efficiency case for pricing carbon’s co-benefits hinges critically on (i) weak prospects for internalizing other externalities through other pricing instruments and (ii) productive use of carbon pricing revenues.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

As part of this support, the WBG has assessed carbon pricing options that could be appropriate for Morocco and simulated their selected economic impacts with macroeconomic model in collaboration with the Research and Forecast Department of the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MoEF) of Morocco. This report outlines the key considerations for policy-makers in Morocco and presents a preliminary finding from modelling conducted by the MoEF in collaboration with the WBG, as well as identifies the needs for the secondary analysis. As part of its national development strategy, Morocco is implementing and planning further reforms of its fiscal systems, energy sector, industrial structure, as well as an ambitious climate change action as per the objectives of the Nationally Determined Contribution. This note explores whether and how these reforms might be supported by aligning fiscal incentives with sectoral policy objectives to accelerate the rate of future growth while reducing its carbon emission intensity. Environmental fiscal reforms (EFRs) are a collection of changes to tax, expenditure, and other policies which collectively seek to raise national development and welfare. This report explores potential options for implementing an environmental fiscal reform (EFR) as part of Morocco’s broader economic strategy and tests the impacts of these options with the Morocco’s CGE model. It is structured as follows. The second section discusses Morocco’s national development challenges and the strategic policy goals, where EFR can play a role. The third section provides an overview of options for EFR in Morocco, as identified by the World Bank Group team and national experts, including (i) modifications of fuel tax structure (TICs) to better reflect social costs of fuel use, (ii) butane subsidy reform, or (iii) more direct environmental pricing through taxes or emissions trading. The fourth section introduces the CGE model for Morocco, used by the DEPF, and simulates impacts of several potential EFR design options identified in the previous section. It also discusses the limitations of the existing CGE model to reflect the impacts of the EFR, and in this context analyzes the results of scenario analysis conducted with the CGE model. The fifth and final section concludes.","[""abstract""]"

The ability to capture and sequester CO2 in a manner compatible with today’s fossil-fuel based power generation infrastructure offers a potentially low-cost contribution to a larger climate change mitigation strategy. The extent to which carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies might lower the cost of CO2 control in competitive electric markets will depend on how they displace existing generating units in a system’s dispatch order, as well as on their competitiveness with abatement alternatives. This paper assumes a perspective intermediate to the more common macro-economic or plant-level analyses of CCS and employs an electric system dispatch model to examine how natural gas prices, sunk capital, and the availability of coal plant retrofits affect CCS economics. Despite conservative assumptions about cost, CCS units are seen to provide significant reductions in base-load CO2 emissions at a carbon price below 100 $/tC. In addition, the availability to retrofit coal plants for post-combustion CO2 capture is not seen to lower the overall cost of CO2 abatement.","[""abstract""]"

With these private benefits from deforestation come external costs: emissions from deforestation currently account for 12 per cent of global carbon emissions. A widespread intervention in reducing emissions from deforestation will affect the paths of agricultural expansion and economic growth of lower income nations. To investigate these processes, this paper presents a general, dynamic, stochastic model of deforestation and economic growth. The model is shown to generate unique deforestation and investment paths and a model without reduced deforestation policy is shown to have a stationary distribution of income and landholdings. There are three main findings. First, in the short run national output growth falls with compensation for reduced deforestation. Second, deforestation rates are reduced through compensating either reduced deforestation directly or the stock of forests; however, compensating the stock of forests is likely to be prohibitively expensive. Finally, by offering a fixed compensation rate, as opposed to a compensation rate tied to a stochastic carbon price, further reductions in deforestation can be achieved.","[""abstract""]"

Yet, beyond the increasing adoption over time, little is known about what polities – countries as well as sub- and supranational entities – adopt carbon pricing and why. This paper explores patterns of adoption (both implemented policies and those scheduled to be) through cluster analysis, with the purpose of investigating factors that could explain polities’ decisions to adopt carbon pricing. The study contributes empirically by studying carbon taxes and emissions trading together and by ordering the polities adopting carbon pricing into clusters. It also contributes theoretically, by exploring constellations of variables that drive the adoption of carbon pricing within individual clusters. We investigated 66 adopted policies of carbon pricing, which were divided into five clusters: early adopters, North-American subnational entities, Chinese pilot provinces, second-wave developed polities, and second-wave developing polities. The analysis indicates that the reasons for adopting carbon pricing have shifted over time. While international factors (climate commitments or influences from polities within the same region) are increasingly salient, domestic factors (including crises and income levels) were more important for the early adopters. Key policy insights Carbon pricing has become a global mainstream policy instrument. Economic and fiscal crises provide windows of opportunity for promoting carbon pricing. The international climate regime can support the adoption of carbon pricing through mitigation commitments and international financial and technical assistance. Learning between polities from the same region is a useful tool for promoting carbon pricing. Carbon intensive economies tend to prefer emissions trading over carbon taxes.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This study explores the potential implications of DDM on supply chain operations by performing a case study. It assesses the impact of distributed production capabilities enabled by additive manufacturing (AM) on the life cycle cost and environmental impact in an aerospace application. It builds on a previous life cycle assessment (LCA) conducted by GE to compare the environmental impacts of using fuels nozzles produced via additive and conventional manufacturing over a future period of 30 years. Here, simulation models are developed to represent the aftermarket of the LEAP engine based on current and forecasted airline fleets for US and Canadian airline operators. Three supply chain operation scenarios are considered: (1) conventional manufactured at a central GE manufacturing plant at a high volume; (2) additive manufactured, high-volume at the same plant; and (3) de-centralized, low-volume, additive manufactured at 7 identified demand locations. 648 experiments were run to capture all relevant combinations of service levels, electricity mix, carbon pricing, and electric truck adoption. Production, distribution, and energy consumption were simulated based on information from publicly available sources. Environmental impacts on resource availability, climate change, human health and ecosystem quality were assessed using an integrated hybrid LCA model developed by the United States (US) Department of Defense (DOD). Data-envelopment analysis was used to benchmark the supply chain operation systems based on their cost, environmental and supply chain performance. 
Both additive production systems show stronger efficiencies than the traditional manufacturing system. The de-centralized system benefits from its flexibility and locations that already contain high amounts of renewable energy highlighting the significance of the site selection process. The centralized system requires inventory to be competitive but shows benefits due to economies of scale and strategic investments that would not be justified for smaller facilities. 
The applied methodology has shown plausible results over all experiments and can therefore be recommended for decision makers from private and public sectors for benchmarking their alternatives when considering cost and environmental criteria.","[""abstract""]"

The modelling work is based on three main policy options for the government by 2030, in the context of Turkey’s mitigation target under its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC), that is, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 21% from its Business as Usual (BAU) scenario in 2030: (i) improving the productivity of renewable energy by 1% per annum, a target already included in the INDC, (ii) introducing a new flat rate tax of 15% per ton of CO2 (of a reference carbon price in world markets) imposed on emissions originating from carbon-intensive sectors, and (iii) introducing a new ETS with caps on emission permits. Our base path scenario projects that GHG emissions in 2030 will be much lower than Turkey’s BAU trajectory of growth from 430 Mt CO2-eq in 2013 to 1.175 Mt CO2-eq by 2030, implying that the government’s commitment is largely redundant. On the other hand, if the official target is assumed to be only a simple reduction percentage in 2030 (by 21%), but based on our more realistic base path, the government’s current renewable energy plans will not be sufficient to reach it. Turkey’s official INDC is based on over-optimistic assumptions of GDP growth and a highly carbon-intensive development pathway; A carbon tax and/or an ETS would be required to reach the 21% reduction target over a realistic base path scenario for 2030; The policy options considered in this paper have some effects on major sectors’ shares in total value-added. Yet the reduction in the shares of agriculture, industry, and transportation does not go beyond 1%, while the service sector seems to benefit from most of the policy options; Overall employment would be affected positively by the renewable energy target, carbon tax, and ETS through the creation of new jobs; Unemployment rates are lower, economic growth is stronger, and households become better off to a larger extent under an ETS than carbon taxation.","[""abstract""]"

In this study, we propose a simple approach to the optimal design of the fly ash and slag mixture in blended concrete that considers the carbon pricing, material cost, strength, workability, and carbonation durability. Firstly, the carbon pricing and the material cost are calculated based on the concrete mixture and unit prices. The total cost equals the sum of the material cost and the carbon pricing, and is set as the optimization’s objective function. Secondly, 25 various mixtures are used as a database of optimization. The database covered a wide range of strengths between 25 MPa and 55 MPa and a wide range of workability between 5 and 25 cm in slump. Gene expression programming is used to predict the concrete’s strength and slump. The ternary blended concrete’s carbonation depth is calculated using the efficiency factors of fly ash and slag. Thirdly, the genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal mixture under various constraints. We provide examples to illustrate the design of ternary blended concrete with different strength levels and environmental CO2 concentrations. The results show that, for a suburban region, carbonation durability is the controlling factor in terms of the design of the mixture when the design strength is less than 40.49 MPa, and the compressive strength is the controlling factor in the design of the mixture when the design strength is greater than 40.49 MPa. For an urban region, the critical strength for distinguishing carbonation durability control and strength control is 45.93 MPa. The total cost, material cost, and carbon pricing increase as the concrete’s strength increases.","[""abstract""]"

Canada will harmonize mitigation with the U.S. “where appropriate” and develop performance-based standards for large industrial emitters, transportation and buildings.4 However, a focus on recent federal approaches ignores long-standing efforts by provinces to mitigate greenhouse gases (GHGs). Original modelling completed for this paper indicates current and planned provincial and federal mitigation could reduce 103 million tonnes (Mt) of GHGs in 2020, or about 46 per cent of Canada’s targets of –17 per cent below 2005. More importantly, Canada is not seized with mitigation inaction; many emitters face carbon costs consistent with emitters in the European Union. Still, more needs to be done but now, at least, Canada is moving in the right direction. Federal Carbon Policy Developments and Carbon Reductions Canada’s announcement in the UNFCCC intercessional climate meetings in Bonn confirmed what the federal government had been signalling for some time: the Government of Canada will regulate GHG emissions using emission standards that specify industry performance and will not implement carbon pricing. Carbon pricing is most certainly dead for now due to the politicization of instrument choice, where the choice of carbon taxes, cap-and-trade or performance-based regulations formed competing political platforms in the 2008 and 2011 national elections. In the political arena the ruling political party rejected the carbon pricing platforms of the other parties.

Results show that the five CP-ETS have been effective in promoting emission reduction, whereas the pilot ETS of Shanghai and Chongqing have failed to drive the covered enterprises to reduce their GHG emission directly. Our findings reveal that at least three key elements, namely, allowance cap, the covered enterprises’ potential emission reduction capacity, and economic structure stability, affect the mitigation efficiency of the CP-ETS. The mitigation efficiency of the CP-ETS may be enhanced by conducting a pre-evaluation of the potential mitigation capacity of the covered enterprises, setting a mechanism for the evaluation and adjustment of the allowance cap, and employing financial tools to maintain the carbon price within a reasonable range that most covered enterprises can afford.","[""abstract""]"

Carbon markets provide flexibility where and when emissions are reduced and could thereby lower the cost of mitigating climate change. This can help countries to enhance the ambition of their NDCs. If not designed and implemented robustly, however, carbon markets could lead to higher emissions and increase the cost of mitigating climate change. Ensuring environmental integrity of carbon market mechanisms is thus an important prerequisite for achieving their objectives. This thesis assesses how the environmental integrity of international carbon market mechanisms can be ensured in the new context of the Paris Agreement in which all countries have NDCs. The thesis assesses how environmental integrity could be defined – here it is assumed to be ensured if the engagement in international transfers of carbon market units leads to the same or lower aggregated global emissions –, what the risks for undermining environmental integrity are, what approaches could be used to address these risks, and what this means for the future role of international carbon market mechanisms. The thesis identifies four factors that inﬂuence environmental integrity (Chapter 2): The accounting for international transfers of carbon market units; The quality of units generated (i.e. whether the market mechanism ensures that the issuance or transfer of units leads to emission reductions in the transferring country); The ambition and scope of the mitigation target of the transferring country; and Incentives or disincentives for future mitigation action, such as possible disincentives for transferring countries to deﬁne future mitigation targets less ambitiously or more narrowly in order to sell more units. Robust accounting is a key prerequisite for ensuring environmental integrity. The diverse scope, metrics, types and timeframe of NDC targets is an important challenge, in particular for avoiding double counting and for ensuring that the accounting for carbon markets units is representative for the mitigation efforts by countries over time. The thesis identifies three ways in which double counting can occur: through double issuance (e.g. by issuing units from the same project under two crediting programs), through double claiming of the same emission reductions by the country where the emission reductions occur and the entity using the carbon market units, and through double use of carbon market units. A key finding is that double counting can also occur in rather indirect ways which can be challenging to identify. Effectively avoiding double counting mainly requires rules for accounting of unit transfers, appropriate design of carbon market mechanisms, and consistent tracking and reporting of units (Chapter 3). Unit quality can, in theory, be ensured through appropriate design of carbon market mechanisms; in practice, existing mechanisms face considerable challenges in ensuring unit quality. The thesis assesses an interesting real-world example of how carbon markets can create perverse incentives and thereby undermine unit quality. It shows that projects abating HFC-23 and SF6 waste gas emissions under the Kyoto Protocol’s Joint Implementation mechanism increased waste gas generation to unprecedented levels as a means to increase credit revenues. Due to these perverse incentives, about two third of the issued credits do not represent actual emission reductions. This case study provides important lessons for carbon markets under the Paris Agreement because Joint Implementation was implemented in countries that had mitigation targets, and thus in a similar context as for countries with NDC targets (Chapter 4). Unit quality is also an important matter for the new Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization. The scheme requires airline operators to purchase carbon market units to offset the increase in emissions above 2020 levels. It could constitute the single largest demand for carbon market units after 2020. The thesis shows that environmental integrity would be undermined if the scheme allows the unlimited use of credits from already implemented projects. While additionality and the quantification of emission reductions are, in principle, key considerations for unit quality for crediting mechanisms, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impact from using credits from already implemented projects is more complex. If the supply of credits considerably exceeds demand, a key consideration for the global GHG emissions impact is whether already implemented projects would continue to reduce GHG emissions even without credit revenues, or whether they are ‘vulnerable’ to discontinuing GHG abatement. A detailed assessment of the status and operating conditions of projects under the Clean Development Mechanism, and their marginal costs of supplying credits, shows that most projects would continue GHG abatement even if they cannot sell credits. If CORSIA allows airline operators the unlimited use of offset credits from these projects, this will not only undermine its environmental objectives but also lead to continued low carbon prices, and thus neither offer incentives for new investments nor lead to any significant revenues for already implemented projects. The thesis recommends limiting eligibility under CORSIA to new or ‘vulnerable’ projects (Chapter 5). Unit quality is also a key consideration when linking emissions trading systems (ETSs). As linking of ETSs faces several practical and political challenges and risks, including with regard to whether allowances have ‘quality’ and whether linking provides incentives or disincentives to enhance the ambition of caps, policy-makers are considering also restricted forms of linking ETSs. The thesis uses a simple economic model and three criteria – abatement outcome, economic implications, and feasibility – to assess three different options for implementing restricted linking of ETSs: quotas, exchange rates, or discount rates. The analysis shows that quotas can enhance cost-effectiveness relative to no linking and allow policy-makers to retain control on the extent of unit flows. Exchange rates could enhance abatement and economic benefits or have unintended adverse implications for cost-effectiveness and total abatement, depending on how rates are set. Due to information asymmetries between the regulated entities and policy-makers setting the exchange rate, and uncertainties about future developments, setting exchange rates in a manner that avoids such unintended consequences could prove difficult. Discount rates, in contrast, can ensure that both cost-effectiveness and total abatement are enhanced. The thesis recommends the consideration of quotas or discount rates, but to refrain from using exchange rates, due to the environmental integrity risks (Chapter 6). The varying scope and ambition of current NDC targets, and possible disincentives to broaden their scope and enhance their ambition, could be addressed by facilitating the adoption of ambitious and economy-wide mitigation targets and by preventing the transfer of carbon market units in situations of high environmental integrity risks. This latter approach could be implemented through eligibility criteria or limits on the generation, transfer or use of carbon market units. Limits could in particular address the risk that some countries have mitigation targets that correspond to higher levels of emissions than independent projections of their likely emissions. If such ‘hot air’ can be transferred to other countries, it could increase aggregated emissions and create a perverse incentive for countries not to enhance the ambition of future mitigation targets. The thesis proposes a typology for such limits, explores key design options, and tests diﬀerent types of limits in the context of fifteen countries. The analysis indicates that limits to international transfers could, if designed appropriately, prevent most of the hot air contained in current mitigation targets from being transferred, but also involve trade-oﬀs between diﬀerent policy objectives (Chapter 7). The thesis concludes by discussing how four strategies to mitigate environmental integrity risks – robust accounting, ensuring unit quality, facilitating economy-wide and ambitious mitigation targets, and restricting international transfers – could be implemented under the Paris Agreement and CORSIA (see Figure S-1). Crediting mechanisms pose higher risks for environmental integrity than linking of ETSs and should therefore have a limited role in the future. International oversight can reduce the risks to environmental integrity to some extent. Acquiring countries could also reduce risks by only acquiring units from countries that also have ambitious NDC targets. Overall, policy-makers should not regard carbon market approaches as the one and only ‘silver-bullet’ to mitigating climate change but carefully assess what policy instrument or mix of instruments is best suited achieve and balance different policy objectives, in particular in light of the rapid transition that is necessary to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement (Chapter 8).","[""abstract""]"

This paper examines the extent to which upstream and downstream greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be considered and acted upon when proponents seek federal approval to build, expand, or modify an interprovincial pipeline. This question has become relevant in the context of Canada's international commitments under the Paris Agreement, which require rapid, broad, and systemic decarbonisation of the Canadian economy. The article examines the questions through the lens of the regulatory frameworks in force at the time of writing (the National Energy Board Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012) as well as draft legislation under Bill C-69, namely the Canadian Energy Regulator Act and the Impact Assessment Act. Although the new laws do not explicitly refer to indirect emissions, a reasonable interpretation of the legislation suggests that federal regulators would be within the bounds of their statutory authority to include indirect emissions in their deliberations and decision-making. A constitutional analysis suggests that that they would also be justified in doing so. The courts have confirmed federal jurisdiction over regulation of GHG emissions under the criminal law power, and there are two reference cases active at the time of writing that will examine the jurisdictional scope of the peace, order and good government power in the context of carbon pricing. Although it is unchartered jurisprudential territory, it is reasonable to conclude that under the new regulatory regime, Parliament will have the statutory and constitutional authority to consider the full implications of GHG emissions associated with an interprovincial pipeline proposal, especially if the courts continue to interpret jurisdictional powers through the flexible, purposive lens of cooperative federalism.","[""abstract""]"

Management under Uncertainty:
Why Natural Disturbance Matters","2019","6","This study examines how natural disturbance can adversely affect the carbon sequestration potential of the forest, and the potential contribution that genomics might make towards offsetting these impacts when carbon is priced. A stochastic dynamic programming model of the BC interior, which includes a detailed carbon accounting module, shows that harvests are delayed as carbon prices rise, with less carbon stored in harvested wood products and more in the forest ecosystem, but an increase in the risk of natural disturbance causes the landowner to harvest sooner. As natural disturbance increases in prevalence and severity, this will somewhat offset the lengthening of rotation age that occurs when carbon is priced. With disturbance, the total amount of carbon sequestered falls significantly, but some of this can be recovered through proactive planting of genetically modified (GM) stems that are more productive and less susceptible to disturbance. To make such an investment worthwhile, however, the costs of planting GM stock should not exceed $120â€“$150/ha. Finally, this study suggests that a modest price of carbon (somewhat less than $25/tCO2) can be an effective incentive to encourage land owners to reduce the rotation age brought about by disturbance, and generate additional carbon offsets.","[""abstract""]"

Both the electric vehicle routing model and the traditional fuel vehicle routing model are constructed aiming at minimizing the total costs, which includes the fixed costs of vehicles, depreciation costs, penalty costs for violating customer time window, energy costs and carbon trading costs. Then a hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) is proposed to address these two models, the advantages of greedy algorithm and random full permutation are combined to set the initial population, at the same time, the crossover operation is improved to retain the excellent gene fragments effectively and the hill climbing algorithm is embedded to enhance the local search ability of HGA. Furthermore, a case data is used with HGA to carry out computational experiments in these two models and the results indicate that first using electric vehicles for distribution can indeed reduce the carbon emissions, but results in a low customer satisfaction compared with using fuel vehicles. Besides, the battery capacity and charge rate have a great influence on total costs of using electric vehicles. Second, carbon price plays an important role in the transformation of logistics companies. As the carbon price changes, the total costs, carbon trading costs, and carbon emissions of using electric vehicles and fuel vehicles are affected accordingly, yet the trends are different. The changes of carbon quota have nothing to do with the distribution scheme and companies’ transformation but influence the total costs of using electric and fuel vehicles for distribution, and the trends are the same. These reasonable proposals can support the government on carbon trading policy, and also the logistics companies on dealing the relationship between economic and social benefits.","[""abstract""]"

Solvent storage refers to the technique of delaying the energy-intensive step of solvent regeneration at post-combustion CCS power plants to later points in time in order to boost electrical output, and hence revenues, when electricity prices are high. This comes at the expense of needing to regenerate the stored rich solvent at a later point in time (i.e. energy penalty), as well as with the requirement for a comparatively large inventory of solvent (i.e. investment cost). An additional merit of solvent storage is the additional degree of freedom that is derived from decoupling electricity generation from the production of sequestration-ready CO2. Power plants that are fitted with the option of solvent storage can be used to balance CO2 flows feeding into transportation and storage systems in order to mitigate downstream issues arising from variable feed-flows [1-5]. Several authors have assessed the additional profits achievable with the option for solvent storage at post-combustion capture CCS power plants under historical and pre-defined price patterns (for electricity and CO2) [6-9]. Only one study [10], to the knowledge of the authors, has investigated the extent to which variable CO2 flows produced by load-following CCS power stations (coal-fired) can be smoothed out with the option for solvent storage (by decoupling electricity generation from the production of CO2). Looking at the profitability of solvent storage the general consensus is that whilst making the option available can recover the required upfront (relatively minor) investment, it does not lead to significant financial benefits in the longer term. A major drawback of most of these studies is, however, the amount of simplifying assumptions that are made in particular when it comes to underlying technical data. It is shown that depending on simplifications made the electricity and carbon price regions in which solvent storage is the profitable differ significantly. Figure 1-2 illustrates this by showing for different electricity and carbon price combinations the most profitable operating mode. Whilst solvent storage becomes profitable at around £72/MWh when common simplifying technical assumptions are used in the techno-economic analysis, this threshold decreases substantially to below £50/MWh under certain price combinations when the analysis is based on detailed technical modelling data.","[""abstract""]"

However, such synergies cannot be exploited without the right incentives. This paper studies the low-carbon operation of MESs by coordinating the transmission-level and distribution-level via the energy-carbon integrated prices. Energy prices are decided by locational marginal pricing principles in the transmission-level MES. At the same time, the carbon emissions of different energy systems are uniformly priced using a carbon emission flow (CEF) model based on the consumers’ actual emission contributions by tracing the embedded flow of CO2. Various distribution-level MESs modeled by energy hubs (EHs) are independently operated in response to the variation in the integrated prices. The whole bi-level model formulates an equilibrium problem and is solved iteratively. Case studies based on two MESs at different scales illustrate the effectiveness and benefit of the proposed carbon pricing method in reducing carbon emissions more efficiently than current methods.","[""abstract""]"

The results for energy savings were analyzed to include the effect of implementation of carbon pricing. It was concluded that because of implementation of carbon pricing, the replacement of conventional heating equipment with more efficient gas-fired heat pump would increase the monetary value of the savings achieved from reduced natural gas consumption, due to increased price of natural gas. Furthermore, due to the longer heating season in Canada and the relatively higher price of electricity compared to natural gas the gas-fired heat pump can potentially achieve positive energy cost savings when operated in both heating and cooling mode even after implementation of carbon pricing.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

However, the choice of the discount rate is hardly discussed when translating policy targets—such as 1.5 °C and 2 °C–into emission reduction strategies with the possibility of overshoot. Integrated assessment models (IAMs) have quantified the sensitivity of low carbon pathways to a series of factors, including economic and population growth, national and international climate policies, and the availability of low carbon technologies, including negative emissions. In this paper we show how and to what extent emission pathways are also influenced by the discount rate. Using both an analytical and a numerical IAM, we demonstrate how discounting affects key mitigation indicators, such as the time when net global emissions reach zero, the amount of carbon budget overshoot, and the carbon price profile. To ensure inter-generational equity and be coherent with cost-benefit analysis normative choices, we suggest that IAMs should use lower discount rates than the ones currently adopted. For a 1000 GtCO2 carbon budget, reducing the discount rate from 5% to 2% would more than double today's carbon price (from 21 to 55 $/tCO2) and more than halve the carbon budget overshoot (from 46% to 16%), corresponding to a reduction of about 300 GtCO2 of net negative emissions over the century.","[""abstract""]"

This paper studies the reasoning behind such policy mixes and the economic interaction effects that result from these different policy instruments. The paper models these interactions using an inter-temporal model that proposes burden sharing between current and future generations. The issuance of green bonds helps to enable immediate investment in climate change mitigation and adaptation, and the bonds would be repaid by future generations in such a way that those who benefit from reduced future environmental damage share in the burden of financing the mitigation efforts undertaken today. The paper examines the effects of combining green bonds and carbon pricing in a three-phase model and uses a numerical solution procedure that allows for finite-horizon solutions and phase changes. The paper shows that green bonds perform better when they are combined with carbon pricing. The proposed policy option appears to be politically more feasible than a green transition based only on carbon pricing, and it is more prudent for debt sustainability than a green transition that relies overly on green bonds.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

These scenarios are defined by two sets of “global megatrends” which have two main axes: natural (e.g. energy prices) and societal (e.g. demographic dynamics). The objective is to provide some quantitative socio-economic and environmental results to reveal the main challenges for EU in the framework of the “socio-ecological transition” without policy intervention and according to the global context. These results will also serve as references to assess the policies proposed to tackle the difficulties identified in this paper. Our results emphasise that none of the economic and employment objectives of the “Europe 2020” strategy while only few European environmental objectives will be reached in the event of a lack of policy responses to the SET. In particular, in one of the scenarios, the unfavourable European demographic and natural conditions do not allow for the release of the sovereign debt burden. The necessary fiscal consolidation induces then a weak economic growth and a high unemployment rate up to 2030. Thus, in that framework, investments enhancing the adaptation to the SET would not be possible. Besides, even in the more favourable scenario, the strong increase in high-skilled labour supply brings about a “bottleneck effect”. The labour demand does not totally absorb this boom of high-skilled labour supply. Therefore, policies such as tackling innovation, research or competitiveness can facilitate to overcome employment and environmental difficulties. However, structural policies for resource efficiency and climate change (e.g. carbon price, energy-saving investments supports or rising of environmental standards) will also be necessary to smooth the path towards a successful socio-ecological transition.

The relationship between carbon prices and electricity prices was found to be positive and symmetric. However, no volatility spillover effect between the carbon market and electricity returns was found in Phase I, whereas such effect existed in Phase II and one which was positive. These results imply that in the short run, electricity companies are significantly affected by the carbon market but this effect diminishes over the long run.

Estimates from a Global Model","2009","0","There is widespread recognition that forestry carbon credits can reduce the net emissions of carbon into the atmosphere. Designing systems to sequester carbon, however, has proven difficult due to a number of efficiency issues, including leakage. Leakage occurs when policy makers develop carbon projects in specific places which protect some parcels of land, but leave other parcels of land unprotected. This analysis uses a newly developed model of global land use change from an established forestry and land use model, described in Sohngen et al. (1999); Sohngen and Mendelsohn (2003); and Kindermann et al. (2008). To assess leakage we estimate carbon under storage under one scenario where the world is awarded carbon credits and another where tropical developing nations are awarded the credits. We focus our results on several regions, namely Brazil, the rest of South America, Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Carbon prices are assumed to be constant, and range from US$0 tC to US$900 tC. The model adjusts global land uses to these specific policies, and leakage is assessed by comparing carbon gains within the project areas to net global changes in carbon. A number of policy relevant results emerge. First, the estimates indicate that leakage ranges from 2% to more than 14%. Second, as carbon credits increase, leakage decreases across the world.","[""abstract""]"

Despite both being simultaneously relevant to future agricultural systems, the two are usually studied separately. By contrast, this study jointly compares the potential impacts of climate change and the effects of mitigation policy on farming systems in the central region of Western Australia’s grainbelt, using the results of several biophysical models integrated into a whole‐farm bioeconomic model. In particular, we focus on the potential for interactions between climate impacts and mitigation activities. Results suggest that, in the study area, farm profitability is much more sensitive to changes in climate than to a mitigation policy involving a carbon price on agricultural emissions. Climate change reduces the profitability of agricultural production and, as a result, reduces the opportunity cost of reforesting land for carbon sequestration. Nonetheless, the financial attractiveness of reforestation does not necessarily improve because climate change also reduces tree growth and, therefore, the income from sequestration. Consequently, at least for the study area, climate change has the potential to reduce the amount of abatement obtainable from sequestration – a result potentially relevant to the debate about the desirability of sequestration as a mitigation option.","[""abstract""]"

The green bonds also develop gradually as a part of green finance. The green bonds are designed to fund the projects of positive environmental impact. If the green bonds are superior to other debt securities, they will attract more investors' participation in green energy projects. Thus, the design of green bonds is crucial to the development of green bonds market. This article assumes that the floating rate of green bonds is linked to carbon price, and carbon price is described by a jump diffusion process. The carbon price fluctuation can lead to interest rate fluctuation of green bonds. We set two boundary values of carbon price, and the coupon rate is revalued when the carbon price reaches the boundary. The higher the carbon price is, the higher the coupon rate is to be paid by issuers. Thus, the boundary can impel issuers to boost energy savings and emission-reduction, and the higher interest rate will also attract more investors to invest in green bonds. The lower the carbon price is, the lower the interest rate is to be paid by issuers. Accordingly, the boundary may encourage issuers to boost emission reduction. This design can monitor and incentivize issuers to make more contribution to green finance. Furthermore, the design is characterized by the double-barrier option, such that the interest rate of green bonds can be obtained by double-barrier option pricing. Subsequently, the central difference method and the composite trapezoidal formula are employed to obtain the numerical solution. Finally, we conduct the sensitivity analysis of the model.","[""abstract""]"

Therefore, it is valuable to evaluate the costs and benefits of low-carbon policy packages to ensure that low-carbon development concepts and strategies can be well integrated into the policy making process. This work uses the Low-carbon Policy Assessment (LPA) model to assess long-term costs and benefits of climate and energy policies in China under the reference (RS) scenario and the low-carbon (LC) scenario, which includes 25 additional climate and energy policies. In the LC scenario, both energy-related CO2 emissions and total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions peak around 2030, achieving China’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) target. Of the policies included in the LC scenario, the five with the highest GHG mitigation potential beyond China’s existing policies are: fluorinated gas (F-gas) substitution, a renewable portfolio standard, carbon pricing, carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS), and a fuel economy standard for heavy duty vehicles (HDVs). In addition to reducing GHG emissions, these policies decrease particulate emissions and associated premature deaths, which would otherwise reduce China’s GDP by nearly 1.5% in 2050. Together, these policies have the potential to promote significant low-carbon prosperity in China.","[""abstract""]"

We show that established metrics used to monitor electricity trading inefficiency become increasingly inaccurate in several trading conditions. We devise the Unweighted and Price-Weighted Inefficient Interconnector Utilisation indices to address these deficiencies. These metrics are substantially more accurate than existing ones and perform equally well whether or not markets are coupled. Our results show a substantial decrease in inefficient trading between Great Britain and both France and the Netherlands after the European Union’s market coupling regulations were introduced in 2014. In view of Great Britain’s likely withdrawal from the European Union, the paper also evaluates how market uncoupling would affect cross-border trade. We find that uncoupling would lead to inefficiencies in trade, the electricity price differential between GB and France (Netherlands) rising by 3% (2%), net imports into GB decreasing by 26% (13%), congestion income decreasing by 10% (5%), and inframarginal surplus decreasing by 1.6% (1.6%) of coupled congestion income. We also show that, should the EU decide to implement an equivalent carbon tax to GB’s Carbon Price Floor, uncoupling impacts would be slightly magnified due to electricity prices converging (by about 1% of coupled congestion income).","[""abstract""]"

First, we introduce the main questions related to this topic. Next, we present a method that enables us to estimate the potential volumes of biomass which may be used in the European power generation. We also derive the biomass and CO2 switching prices, which make profitable the biomass co-firing in different types of coal plants. Finally, we rely on recent literature to figure out what are the potential biomass feedstocks in the EU countries, and we compare those resources with results of our estimations. Results indicate that the potential biomass demand from the power sector may be quite high compared with the potential biomass supply. We also identify that the biomass co-firing can produce high volumes of CO2 abatements, which may account for more than two times the potential abatements from the coal-to-gas fuel switching. Our economic analysis about biomass and CO2 breakeven prices shows that co-firing can remain profitable with very high biomass prices, when the carbon price is high enough. Hence, the carbon price appears as an important driver of co-firing, which can make a high share of the potential biomass demand from the power sector being economically profitable, even with high biomass prices. However, as biomass stocks are limited, such a situation would result in potential conflicts between different biomass usages.","[""abstract""]"

Even though there is regional fragmentation in terms of climate change strategies in Latin America, market-based initiatives are taking shape also in this region. Post-2020, combining these efforts towards carbon integration via an Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) could be an option for Latin America to adhere to more cohesive and ambitious climate policy actions. Given the lack of quantitative studies, this paper aims to provide preliminary evidence on the appropriateness of this mitigation policy, highlighting potential environmental and economic outcomes in Latin America, as well as identifying trade patterns and the effects of revenue recycling for the region. Using a dynamic-recursive computable equilibrium model, a hypothetical Latin American ETS regulates only carbon emissions from the electricity generation and energy-intensive sectors. Regional carbon-integration among developing countries in this way demonstrates that it is possible to curb emissions at minimum cost. The distributional effect of linking shows a financial flow from Brazil and Mexico to the rest of Latin America, comprising a wider abatement effort within a shared carbon price. There are opportunities from revenue-recycling, which plays an important role in alleviating the additional costs from the policy. The advantage of this approach is to culminate in broad participation where competitiveness concerns may be addressed along with transformations of the energy system. However, to effectively address climate change, additional sectors should be considered for inclusion in the proposed ETS, in line with the region’s energy and economic profiles. Key policy insights A regional carbon policy based on emissions trading in Latin America would expand opportunities for mitigation at lower cost. Brazil and Mexico would import allowances more cost-effectively from the rest of Latin America in the linked scenario. Further energy substitution towards low-carbon sources would be achieved with revenue recycling. A linked ETS system should include land use and forestry-related emissions.","[""abstract""]"

This paper introduces two widely used renewable energy incentives (such as carbon trading mechanism and green certificate transaction mechanism) into traditional generation expansion planning, and establishes a low-carbon generation expansion planning model. Then the brain storm optimization algorithm was employed to solve the model. Finally, for the comparison between the two mechanisms, this paper sets four scenarios for case simulation. The results show that both carbon trading mechanisms and green certificate transaction mechanisms can increase the installed capacity of renewable energy and reduce carbon emissions, and the optimization effect of green certificate transaction mechanism on planning results is better than that of the carbon trading mechanism. When both mechanisms are introduced, the installed proportion of renewable energy will be the highest and carbon emissions will achieve the minimum. Moreover, with the increase of carbon price or green certificate price, and the strengthening of carbon emission constraint or renewable energy quota constraint, the proportion of coal-fired units in the power supply structure is gradually decreasing, and the carbon emissions of the system are gradually reduced.","[""abstract""]"

We performed an ecological/economic analysis of rewetting drained fertile peatlands in a hemiboreal climate using different land use strategies over 80 years. Vegetation, soil processes, and total GHG emissions were modeled using the CoupModel for four scenarios: (1) business as usual—Norway spruce with average soil water table of −40 cm; (2) willow with groundwater at −20 cm; (3) reed canary grass with groundwater at −10 cm; and (4) a fully rewetted peatland. The predictions were based on previous model calibrations with several high‐resolution datasets consisting of water, heat, carbon, and nitrogen cycling. Spruce growth was calibrated by tree‐ring data that extended the time period covered. The GHG balance of four scenarios, including vegetation and soil, were 4.7, 7.1, 9.1, and 6.2 Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1, respectively. The total soil emissions (including litter and peat respiration CO2 + N2O + CH4) were 33.1, 19.3, 15.3, and 11.0 Mg CO2eq ha−1 year−1, respectively, of which the peat loss contributed 35%, 24%, and 7% of the soil emissions for the three drained scenarios, respectively. No peat was lost for the wet peatland. It was also found that draining increases vegetation growth, but not as drastically as peat respiration does. The cost–benefit analysis (CBA) is sensitive to time frame, discount rate, and carbon price. Our results indicate that the net benefit was greater with a somewhat higher soil water table and when the peatland was vegetated with willow and reed canary grass (Scenarios 2 and 3). We conclude that saving peat and avoiding methane release using fairly wet conditions can significantly reduce GHG emissions, and that this strategy should be considered for land use planning and policy‐making.","[""abstract""]"

Under uncertainties in natural gas price and the imposition of a carbon price, our method identifies that selling the coke to China for electricity generation by integrated gasification combined cycle is likely to be financially preferred initially, but eventually hydrogen production in Alberta is likely to be preferred. Compared to the results of a previous study that used life cycle costing to identify the financially preferred alternative, the inclusion of real options analysis adds value as it accounts for flexibility in decision-making (e.g., to delay investment), increasing the project's expected net present value by 25% and decreasing the expected life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 11%.

This research proposes a calculation procedure for the mix design of silica fume-blended high-strength concrete with an optimal total cost considering various carbon pricings. First, the material cost and CO2 emission cost are determined using concrete mixture and unit prices. Gene expression programming (GEP) is used to evaluate concrete mechanical and workability properties. Second, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to search the optimal mixture, considering various constraints, such as design compressive strength constraint, design workability constraint, range constraints, ratio constraints, and concrete volume constraint. The optimization objective of the GA is the sum of the material cost and the cost of CO2 emissions. Third, illustrative examples are shown for designing various kinds of concrete. Five strength levels (from 95 to 115 MPa with steps of 5 MPa) and four carbon pricings (normal carbon pricing, zero carbon pricing, five-fold carbon pricings, and ten-fold carbon pricings) are considered. A total of 20 optimal mixtures are calculated. The optimal mixtures were found the same for the cases of normal CO2 pricing and zero CO2 pricing. Optimal mixtures with higher strengths are more sensitive to variation in carbon pricing. For five-fold CO2 pricing, the cement content of mixtures with higher strengths (105, 110, and 115 MPa) are lower than those of normal CO2 pricing. As the CO2 pricing increases from five-fold to ten-fold, for mixtures with a strength of 110 MPa, the cement content becomes lower. Summarily, the proposed method can be applied to the material design of sustainable high-strength concrete with low material cost and CO2 emissions.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

With Emissions Trading Schemes (ETS) emerging in developed and developing regions around the world, linking these systems may become a future option. This raises the question as to the appropriateness of bilateral ETS linkages between developed and developing regions. Based on discussions of carbon pricing in Brazil, this paper investigates the impact of a sectoral ETS covering electricity and energy-intensive sectors using a global economy-wide model, the EPPA6. Additionally, we simulate a link with a developed region, Europe, under five alternative ETS design scenarios. We find that a sectoral ETS linkage results, for both participants, in more significant emissions reductions, a technological substitution towards alternative energy, and losses in GDP and welfare where a stringent cap is imposed. The appropriate ETS design to seize mitigation opportunities cost-effectively for both regions includes a less stringent cap for Brazil, the introduction of revenue recycling for the production of alternative energy and, in the long-term, the banking of permits. As Brazil presents an importer profile of allowances in the short run, and becomes an exporter to Europe by 2050, this design would concurrently provide emissions reductions and, to a certain extent, improve the cost effectiveness of the ETS linkage in the long-term. RESUMO O Acordo de Paris recentemente ressaltou a importância da cooperação internacional através da precificação de carbono, assim como a necessidade de suporte dos países desenvolvidos e em desenvolvimento para enfrentar o problema das mudanças climáticas. Com a Esquemas de Comércio de Emissões (ECE) emergindo em regiões desenvolvidas e em desenvolvimento em todo o mundo, integrar tais sistemas pode se tornar uma opção no futuro. Isto levanta a questão sobre ser apropriado uma integração bilateral de ECE entre as regiões desenvolvidas e em desenvolvimento. Baseado nas discussões de precificação de carbono no Brasil, esse paper investiga os impactos de um ECE setorial cobrindo os setores de eletricidade e indústrias energointensivas usando um modelo econômico global, o EPPA6. Além disso, simulamos a integração com o mercado de uma região desenvolvida, a Europa, sob cinco cenários com diferentes arranjos de ECE. Verificou-se que uma integração de ECE setorial resulta, para ambos participantes, em significative redução de emissões, em uma substituição tecnológica por energias alternativas, e perdas de PIB e bem-estar onde um limite de emissões rigoroso é imposto. O arranjo de ETS mais apropriado para aproveitar as oportunidades de mitigação de maneira custo-efetiva para ambas regiões inclue adotar uma meta menos ambiciosa para o Brasil, introduzir reciclagem das receitas na produção de energia alternativa e, no longo prazo, admitir a poupança de permissões. Como o Brasil apresenta um perfil importador de permissões no curto prazo, e se torna exportador para Europa até 2050, esse arranjo poderia simultaneamente reduzir emissões e, em certa medida, melhorar a custo-efetividade da integração do ECE no longo prazo.","[""abstract""]"

Moreover, the impact of the fuel-switch on emission reductions is highly dependent on the initial relationship of fuel prices for gas and coal given low carbon prices. Conversely the dependency decreases with higher carbon prices. Overall, the marginal benefit of ambitious carbon prices is capped by the capacity utilization of gas-fired power plants.

 How should carbon be taxed as a part of fiscal policy? The literature on optimal carbon pricing often abstracts from other taxes. However, when governments raise revenues with distortionary taxes, carbon levies have fiscal impacts. While they raise revenues directly, they may shrink the bases of other taxes (e.g. by decreasing employment). This article theoretically characterizes and then quantifies optimal carbon taxes in a dynamic general equilibrium climate–economy model with distortionary fiscal policy. First, this article establishes a novel theoretical relationship between the optimal taxation of carbon and of capital income. This link arises because carbon emissions destroy natural capital: they accumulate in the atmosphere and decrease future output. Consequently, this article shows how the standard logic against capital income taxes extends to distortions on environmental capital investments. Second, this article characterizes optimal climate policy in sub-optimal fiscal settings where income taxes are constrained to remain at their observed levels. Third, this article presents a detailed calibration that builds on the seminal DICE approach but adds features essential for a setting with distortionary taxes, such as a differentiation between climate change production impacts (e.g. on agriculture) and direct utility impacts (e.g. on biodiversity existence value). The central quantitative finding is that optimal carbon tax schedules are 8–24% lower when there are distortionary taxes, compared to the setting with lump-sum taxes considered in the literature.","[""abstract""]"

The key objective is to distil the key lessons for the design of the market mechanisms under the Paris Agreement. A key aspect of the review is the identification of distinct periods with specific challenges faced by markets and regulatory systems. The first period from 1997 until 2005 is characterized by the introduction of market mechanisms as a climate change mitigation tool. The operationalization of market mechanisms required the establishment of officially approved baseline and monitoring methodologies and piloting activities in different sectors. The nascent carbon market was characterized by the lack of demand from the private sector making the initial participation of the public sector crucial. Between 2005 and 2011, the carbon markets entered a phase characterized by great expansion. This period saw significant changes in markets and regulatory frameworks as the EU ETS became operational and was linked to the Kyoto mechanisms. This link created a large source of demand for carbon credits from the private sector adding to the demand from governments, e.g. in Japan. During this “gold rush” period criticism emerged with regards to the uneven distribution of projects and limited participation of poorer countries, as well as issues related to baselines and additionality that affected environmental integrity. The next period is characterized by a sudden fall in carbon prices between 2011 and 2013 and the resulting decline in the development of new carbon projects. This market crisis is due to changes in both domestic and international regulatory regimes. At the domestic level, the issuance of carbon credits started reaching the quantitative limits on the use of offsets in the EU ETS effectively eliminating the largest source of demand. At the international level, the failure of the Copenhagen conference and uncertainty surrounding the second Kyoto Commitment Period resulted in a drying up of demand from governments. The post-Paris period is characterized by significant changes in the international climate regime. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015 involves global participation in mitigation, which will increase complexity. New market mechanisms will therefore face both old challenges – supply-demand balance, environmental integrity, transaction costs – and new ones – interactions with other policies and national targets, sectoral and policy baselines, enhancing the sustainable development contribution, etc.","[""abstract""]"

In the application of the marginal abatement cost, the abatement distribution scheme with minimum cost is established under different abatement targets. The conclusions of abatement distribution scheme indicate that those heavy industries with low MACs and high carbon intensity should take more responsibility for emissions reduction and vice versa. Finally, the policy implications for marginal abatement cost are provided.","[""abstract""]"

Based on a carbon emission reduction’s target, different carbon taxation strategies have been implemented around the world. Generally, governments launch the carbon tax with a relatively low carbon price and plan to increase it incrementally over the years by adopting various strategies in a way to attend their emission reduction objective. The majority of developed mathematical models within the green supply chain design (GSCD) under carbon tax legislation have ignored the dynamic aspect of this legislation. Within this paper, we aim to contribute to the literature by studying the impact of the dynamic carbon tax legislations on the strategic decisions of a SC, its economic and environmental performances. Within this optic, we study the technology investment problem under different progressive strategies of carbon taxation, mainly a linear, a convex and a concave carbon taxes functions as well as a constant carbon tax law. Our objective is to assess and compare the efficiency of these progressive strategies for the purpose of assisting companies that are greening their SCs, in finding a compromise between reducing their carbon emissions and increasing their profits.","[""abstract""]"

Quantifying fugitive emissions from wastewater systems is an area of uncertainty for the industry, with less developed and less reliable methodologies. This level of uncertainty in the wastewater industry’s “carbon profile” is unacceptable in the emerging business environment of carbon pricing, and managerial commitments to “carbon neutrality”. Methane and nitrous oxide emissions have much higher global warming potentials than carbon dioxide. This study reviews existing knowledge on their production in wastewater systems and defines their relative importance compared to emissions from energy usage in both wastewater systems and other economic sectors.

The model is highly disaggregated, representing all voyages and cargoes transported through to 2050, including approximately 500 shippers and 750 shipowners with a total fleet of greater than 1000 vessels. In multiple projection scenarios, 2700 trade flows are modelled. The purpose of the approach is to identify a high fidelity representation of the system to gain a greater understanding of how aggregate level properties, for example total fuel consumption, are generated from individual company based decisions such as when to transport cargo, what vessels to use, and what technology to invest in. Contracts of affreightment, the spot market and time charter market are represented within the model to create, where possible, a realistic representation of actual contractual conditions. The model is deployed to investigate the impact of climate change on the sector. Specifically, it investigated: physical impacts of climate change through the opening of Arctic sea routes; changing demand for commodities due to climate change and projected evolution of the global economy; changing fuel prices due to external projected changes in the shipping sector, and; effects of mitigation of climate change through carbon pricing and minimum standards on vessel efficiency. A key finding from the work is that endogeneous changes in the shipping system, through for example shipper preferences, create greater variability than those driven by external factors. This variability is reflected in the number of vessels in each of the size categories, the technology uptaken and the strategic approach of shippers in transporting their cargo. There remains a strong coupling of transport supply and emissions, with the regulations tested and available technology not resulting in significant improvements in energy efficiency. On the modelling of the dry bulk shipping system, clear computational and scope limits were identified. On computational limits, the system is constrained such that parallelisation is limited leading to long runtimes. To understand the effects of agents choices, the modelling of the individual voyages is necessary leading to large degrees of freedom. In addition, the work has highlighted the need for more validation data of greater granularity.","[""abstract""]"

The policies considered here include a modified Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) by itself as well as combined with a cellulosic biofuel tax credit or a carbon price policy. We use a dynamic, spatial, multi-market equilibrium model, Biofuel and Environmental Policy Analysis Model (BEPAM), to endogenously determine the effects of these policies on cropland allocation, food and fuel prices, and the mix of first- and second-generation biofuels. We find that the RFS could be met by diverting 6% of cropland for biofuel production and would result in corn prices increasing by 16% in 2002 relative to the business-as-usual baseline. The reduction in GHG emissions in the U.S. due to the RFS is about 2%; these domestic GHG savings can be severely eroded by emissions due to indirect land-use changes and the increase in gasoline consumption in the rest of the world. Supplementing the RFS with a carbon price policy or a cellulosic biofuel tax credit induces a switch away from corn ethanol to cellulosic biofuels and achieves the mandated level of biofuel production with a smaller adverse impact on crop prices. These supplementary policies enhance the GHG savings achieved by the RFS alone, although through different mechanisms; greater production of cellulosic biofuels with the tax credit but larger reduction in fossil fuel consumption with a carbon tax.","[""abstract""]"

This article designs several carbon taxation scenarios at the consumption level. It includes reallocation proposals and evaluates the policy impacts of intermediate to high carbon prices. It measures greenhouse gas emissions and several associated costs. The food system is the 2 highest contributor to climate change after the energy sector. It is estimated to contribute 30% of the total greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE), particularly due to emissions from the meat and dairy sector. Although the food system is less studied than the energy sector, a carbon tax on food could also contribute to emissions mitigation as a strong signal to economic actors. A carbon tax based on the differing emission potentials of disaggregated food groups gives a rationale for targeting different sets of products, especially foods rich in animal proteins, and including a revenue-neutral policy. In taxation design, carbon pricing is a strategic issue. While introducing a variation in the carbon price just transfers the same variation in tax rates, the effect on the associated nutritional and equity costs are unknown. Scanner data from French households in 2010 were analyzed. Several GHGE indicators and related nutritional impacts, such as diet quality scores and the shift from animal to plant proteins, were also evaluated. Distributional effects, estimated for continuous distribution, were also measured through an inequality index. Policy relevance • Taxing all food purchases at a high carbon price (140€/t CO2eq) would reduce GHGEs 15% to 17% according to indicators. • A revenue-neutral carbon taxation scenario may have nutritional and distributive cobenefits, combining GHGE reduction with a better adherence to nutritional guidelines and a slightly improved distribution of the food expenditure. • Comparing the effect of high vs intermediate carbon prices, the impacts on the tax revenue, nutritional improvements and equity gains are non-proportional to the price gap. • Higher carbon pricing may provide stronger mitigation effects and increase cobenefits, which should encourage policy-makers to consider this option with more urgency.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

The carbon tax scenario is consistent with proposed U.S. legislation starting at $15 t−1 CO2-equivalent (CO2-e) and increasing annually by $10. The scenario covers carbon taxes from $15 to $105 over the 10-year projection period. Our results show that at the end of the projection period, the production cost for corn and soybeans increases by 16.4% and 11.9%, respectively at a carbon tax of $105 t−1 CO2-e. The increase in the cost of production is compensated in part by a slight increase in commodity prices and a contraction in area. Hence, the decrease in net returns for corn, soybeans, and wheat is 7.4%, 4.2%, and 8.0%, respectively, for the highest carbon price. Exports from the U.S. decrease for all commodities except rapeseed and wheat which experience an increase by 1.4% and 0.1%, respectively. Corn and soybean exports decrease by 5.0% and 0.8%, respectively. These changes in trade patterns also result in a re-allocation of land-use in the rest of the world leading to a slight increase in GHG emissions representing 0.6% of total U.S. emissions in 2017. It is important to note that our study only covers one particular sector of a carbon tax and the increase in emissions is small compared to the overall projected reduction.","[""abstract""]"

The uncertainty surrounding if and when a carbon price will be imposed introduces risk into the decision to invest in long-lived capital assets that are used in conjunction with fossil fuels. To understand how the macroeconomy responds to this climate policy risk, we develop a quantitative model that includes investment in long-lived, sector-specific assets such as coal power plants or wind farms. Using the observed internal carbon prices firms voluntarily levy on themselves, we infer firms’ beliefs about the likelihood of a future carbon tax. We find that the risk of a future policy distorts investments towards a cleaner mix of capital, driving down U.S. carbon emissions. The emissions reduction caused by climate policy risk are equivalent to the reduction that would be achieved by imposing a carbon tax of $3.21/ton of CO2. Importantly, however, the non-environmental welfare costs incurred by achieving the emission reductions through the threat of a future policy are twice as large as the costs incurred by simply using the equivalent tax policy. More generally, our results demonstrate that, by ignoring the impacts of climate policy risk, existing studies have overstated both the welfare costs and emissions reductions resulting from a carbon tax policy. ∗Arizona State University, W.P.

In the long run, however, there is a trade-off between diversification and climate action. Therefore, in general, the carbon-intensive sector is not shut down completely. We derive the optimal carbon price, the equilibrium risk-free rate, and the risk premium of both assets. The risk-free rate is negatively affected by temperature, while the effect of temperature on the risk premiums depends on the type of damage specification. Climate disasters with an uncertain timing that rises with on temperature leads to a significant effect of climate change on asset prices.","[""abstract""]"

However, judging from the research status and business practices in China and abroad, there is no general carbon budget system to guide the development of carbon emission and emission reduction activities. Based on this background, this paper first attempts to construct an enterprise carbon budget system comprising four sub-budgets: carbon emission, carbon emission reduction and cost, carbon emission rights trading, and carbon emission reduction net profit/loss. It draws on the idea of interactive control to consider the impact of changes in carbon prices, energy prices, and policy guidelines on carbon emission reductions and losses. A carbon budget management system based on interactive control is then constructed and applied to China National Aviation Holding Air China Group (AC Aviation). The research results show that the carbon budget system based on interactive control can dynamically adjust carbon emission reduction behavior based on changes in carbon and energy prices to make carbon budgeting a more viable carbon reduction tool and institutional arrangement.","[""abstract""]"

Due to lack of consensus on several contentious topics surrounding accounting, integrity and ambition, the rules for the market mechanisms under Article 6 have been postponed to COP25. Even if the guidelines for transfers of international emission reduction credits in cooperative approaches (Article 6.2) and the rules, modalities and procedures for the UNFCCC-supervised crediting mechanism (Article 6.4) are adopted as planned at COP25, the full operationalization of these mechanisms is expected to take several years. In this context, the objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive overview of key design elements implemented in existing “baseline and credit” carbon crediting schemes and to draw lessons that can inform the negotiations on Article 6. 
In a first step, the paper identifies the most important carbon crediting schemes at different levels of governance and of different geographical focus for analysis and subsequently compares them along six main dimensions: Governance and accounting; scope and eligibility; environmental integrity; monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV); sustainable development (SD) contributions; and linkages with other carbon pricing instruments. While international crediting schemes have suffered from a lack of demand since the early 2010s, domestic crediting schemes are spreading at national and subnational levels. At the international level, the study reviews key features of the international crediting schemes under the Kyoto Protocol, notably the Clean Development Mechanism, Joint Implementation and Green Investment Schemes for International Emissions Trading. As an example for bilaterally implemented schemes, the Joint Crediting Mechanism is included. At a (sub)national level, schemes from Australia, California, Canadian provinces, China, Spain and Switzerland were selected.

This research fills a gap in academic literature by analysing the EU renewables

‘special’ status, allowing export restrictions, price enhancements, priority market 
access, tax exemptions and payment guarantees. This ‘special’ status is analysed 
via case law and empirical research data. 
The case law analysis confirms a lex specialis approach by the CJEU. This is 
considered problematic from a legal consistency point of view, as it leads to unclear 
investment signals and short-termism in an industry with long-term investment 
horizons. 
Uniquely, within the academic context, the empirical research considers how market 
operators view these conflicts, via the findings of semi-structured interviews. The 
research shows that market operators (i) prioritise regulatory stability to ensure longterm 
asset business case validity, (ii) mitigate against uncertainty via higher financial 
returns and (iii) lobby legislators and regulators to manage change. Market operators 
recognise that diagonal conflicts exist and see the CJEU’s use of lex specialis as a 
temporary expedient, surrounded by judicial and political risk. 
The research proposes regulatory change to remove the ‘special’ status and outlined 
diagonal conflicts, including carbon pricing mechanisms, removing fossil fuel 
subsidies and enforcing network access rules. These proposals align the regulatory

Subsidies such as production tax credits, feed-in tariffs, and renewable energy credits motivate wind and other renewable generators to submit negative energy bids in power markets; this lessened flexibility may increase system fuel costs and, in some cases, air pollution emissions when energy prices are below zero. Our simulations of large negative bids can also be interpreted as representing European Union (EU) policies of granting wind absolute priority in dispatch. Applications to four systems with different generation mixes and amounts of flexibility illustrate the effects that large negative bids/absolute priority can have on unit commitment and dispatch. Larger negative bids incent the system to accept more wind generation during periods of negative energy prices. This leads to more start-ups and shut-downs of conventional generators and higher total system costs. Further, CO2 emissions sometimes, but not always, increase under those conditions.

"212695688","null","null","Pere Mir-Artigues, Combining tariffs ... deployment policy","2014","0","The economics literature has paid attention to the analysis of policy combinations in the climate and energy policy realms. Following the well-known prin ciple in economics that a single market failure is best addressed with one instrument, while multiple market failures require multiple instruments (Tinbergen 1952, del Río 2009, Fischer and Preonas 2010), the literature generally argues that we need  to combine several instruments. The scope of such c ombinations clearly depends on the externalities to be addressed and, in short, on the technical mat urity and commercial competitiveness of the energy technologies in general and renewable energy techno logies (RETs) in particular. For example, while R&D support is critical in the first stages of the innovation process (basic and applied R&D), its relevance comparatively diminishes as we advance to the pre-commercial stages. It becomes relatively unimportant for fully commercial technologies chara cterised by a dominant design. In contrast, a carbon price is useful to internalize the negative environmental externality, which is the most releva nt in the last stages of the innovation process. Deployment support has generally been justified for intermediate stages. Although there is a wide agreement that combinations may be needed to tackle the market failures, it has also been shown that them could lead to conflicts, resulting in ineffici encies, redundancies, double coverage or double counting (Sorrel and Sijm 2003, del Río 2007). This empirical finding has led many to be sceptical about instrument combinations. This paper focuses o n the interaction mechanism of instrument combinations to support the deployment of electrici ty from renewable energy sources (RES-E), analysing whether such combination is either redund ant or cost-effective with respect to the use of a single instrument. There are several RES-E deployment instruments, whi ch generally fall in two groups: primary instruments (feed-in tariffs (FITs), feed-in premiu s (FIPs), quotas with tradable green certificates (TGCs) and tendering schemes) and secondary instrum ents (investment subsidies, fiscal incentives and soft loans, among others) (see section 2). However, th abundant literature comparing the primary instruments between them (see, among others, Ragwit z et al 2007, del Rio and Gual 2004 and Finon and Perez 2007) contrasts with the scarce research on their detailed interactions. Virtually no attention has been paid to the combina tion of deployment instruments for the same technology, not even in recent, highly influential policy documents such as the policy chapter in the IPPC Report on Climate Change and Renewables (Mitch ell et al 2011) and the IEA Report on Policies for Renewables (Müller et al 2011) . This neglect is all the more striking given the e xistence of combinations of deployment instruments either for t he same technology or across technologies in the real world (REN21 2005 and 2009). What RES-E suppor t licies to use and, therefore, how to combine them in order to promote the deployment of RES-E cost-effectively is a relevant issue for governments, at least in the EU, where ambitious ta rge s for the penetration of renewable energy in energy consumption have been set for 2020 (Directiv 28/2009/EC).","[""abstract""]"

Thus, according to the sole energy viewpoint, outcomes of actions can seem low or even negative whereas in taking into account Multiple Benefits (MBs) the conclusion tends to be more positive. Nevertheless, these conclusions are more complex to obtain. To include the MBs in the analysis, we use the functional economy model that focuses on the performance of a response to a functional need instead of the material production. This theory has other specific key features: the incorporation of external factors in meeting functional needs and a deep interaction with local economic development. Thereby, in such a framework, some of the MBs can be taken into account via an estimation of the monetized value of:  Impact on household’s welfare:  Set-temperature increase (willingness to pay for comfort).  Green value (building market value linked to energy labelling).  Health impacts.  Economic development:  Disposable income fed back into economy (propensity to consume).  Added value created from the local installers.  Value creation for utilities (loss margin, Energy Efficiency Obligation if existing).  Social welfare:  GHG mitigation (carbon price) and other externalities.  Social expenditure decrease. To investigate this large field of study, we rely on a French regional energy efficiency programme providing incentive for a wood stove in case of an existing electric space heating system. 45 households were surveyed regarding their energy consumption and their characteristics. Likewise, the survey highlights household behaviours concerning both space heating before and after refurbishment (e.g. declared set-temperature). A three years billing is used to calculate the energy savings. Beyond the electricity savings, we give a monetary value of the MBs considered on a progressively extended assessment scope, starting from a household perspective towards a societal perspective: adding step by step the value of MBs, we explicit the increase of energy efficiency value even if the figures include large uncertainties. We show the interest of such an approach by ranking the MBs and showing that the green value could be the largest MB of the studied programme.","[""abstract""]"

In this study, a configuration model of DCP-IESs was established to obtain the economic and low-carbon energy uses of the data centers, based on mixed integer linear programming. In the model, carbon emissions were converted to economic indicators through carbon pricing. Then, the configuration model was modified according to the security of the proposed device switching logic, and the Markov-based reliability estimation method was used to ensure the redundant design of the configuration. Using the new energy configuration method, the DCP-IES configuration scheme could be obtained under economical, low-carbon, and high reliability conditions. A data center park in Shanghai was selected as a case study, and the results are as follows: it will only take 2.88 years for the economics of DCP-IES to reach those of traditional data center energy systems. Additionally, the use of configuration model in DCP-IES would result in a reduction in annual carbon emissions of 39,323 tons, with a power usage effectiveness of 1.388, whereas an increase in reliability results in an increasingly faster increase in the initial investment cost.","[""abstract""]"

The GMC factor is obtained by means of a sample of 182 firms from 19 European countries operating in 35 sectors: from January 2008 to December 2018 the value-weight returns of 91 firms regulated by the 2003/87/CE directive are subtracted from the value-weight returns of 91 firms exempted by the 2003/87/CE directive upon which the EU-ETS is based. Secondly, we provide evidence that the addition of the GMC factor improves the performance of the 5 factor model in Europe in the 2008-2018 time span. Thirdly, results show that there is a high green premium rather than a carbon premium as it was asserted by parts of the literature, and that this green premium is highly statistically significant. Fourthly, after performing a carbon stress test, we show the effects of EU-ETS average price shocks on both carbon and green firms for each market cap tranche.","[""abstract""]"

Global fossil CO2 emissions have grown three years consecutively: +1.5% in 2017, +2.1% in 2018, and our slower central projection of +0.6% in 2019 (range of –0.32% to 1.5%) to 37 ± 2 Gt CO2 (Friedlingstein et al 2019 Earth Syst. Sci. Data accepted), after a temporary growth hiatus from 2014 to 2016. Economic indicators and trends in global natural gas and oil use suggest a further rise in emissions in 2020 is likely. CO2 emissions are decreasing slowly in many industrialized regions, including the European Union (preliminary estimate of −1.7% [–3.4% to +0.1%] for 2019, −0.8%/yr for 2003–2018) and United States (−1.7% [–3.7% to +0.3%] in 2019, −0.8%/yr for 2003–2018), while emissions continue growing in India (+1.8% [+0.7% to 3.7%] in 2019, +5.1%/yr for 2003–2018), China (+2.6% [+0.7% to 4.4%] in 2019, +0.4%/yr for 2003–2018), and rest of the world ((+0.5% [−0.8% to 1.8%] in 2019, +1.4%/yr for 2003–2018). Two under-appreciated trends suggest continued long-term growth in both oil and natural gas use is likely. Because per capita oil consumption in the US and Europe remains 5- to 20-fold higher than in China and India, increasing vehicle ownership and air travel in Asia are poised to increase global CO2 emissions from oil over the next decade or more. Liquified natural gas exports from Australia and the United States are surging, lowering natural gas prices in Asia and increasing global access to this fossil resource. To counterbalance increasing emissions, we need accelerated energy efficiency improvements and reduced consumption, rapid deployment of electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage technologies, and a decarbonized electricity grid, with new renewable capacities replacing fossil fuels, not supplementing them. Stronger global commitments and carbon pricing would help implement such policies at scale and in time.","[""abstract""]"

Fossil Fuel Market Reactions to the Paris Agreement and the 2016 US Election Are world climate policies ambitious? Environmentalists claim too little is being done. Industry argues policy is too interventionist and warns that stranding significant assets could lead to financial instability. We evaluate the impacts of global climate policymaking in an event study for two high-profile events, the election of President Trump and the Paris climate agreement, on the stock market value of energy sector firms. To identify the stock price changes due to the two events, we exploit the differential impacts of the events on fossil fuel and renewable energy firms. Using the impulse-indicator saturation method, we find that both events had large and significant effects on the value of renewable energy firms, positive for Paris and negative for the Trump election. The effects on fossil fuel firms have, as expected, the opposite signs. Chapter 2: Climate Policy: Effects of the Trump Election on Fossil Fuel Commodity Markets The unexpected election of Donald Trump shifted expectations on several dimensions, including lower corporate taxes, (re-)reform of the healthcare system, and changes to immigration and trade policies. Within the fossil fuel industry, environmental regulations were expected to be substantially weakened. Earlier work has shown that the election led to increased profit expectations among fossil fuel firms. This paper seeks to nuance the picture and understand whether Trump was expected primarily to help mine more coal or burn more coal. While both supplyand demand-side policies boost profits, they would have different effects on the futures market for coal. We use the differential impact of the touted changes in climate policy and other environmental regulations to identify the price changes due to expectations regarding the path of climate policy under Trump. Using event study analysis, we find large price effects in coal and natural gas futures markets. Over the 21-day post-election period, which includes the nomination of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator, we observe cumulative average abnormal returns of up to –27% for coal and 19% for natural gas. Chapter 3: Coordinated Carbon Taxes or Tightened NDCs: Distributional Implications of Two Options for Climate Negotiations The focus of this paper is to study the distributional implications of two different ways of strengthening the Paris Agreement, either by incorporating carbon pricing or through tightening of the nationally determined contributions (NDCs), which outline national goals for greenhouse gas emissions reductions. We quantify a number of different burden-sharing principles that have been proposed by representatives from various countries. Our results suggest that both carbon pricing and tightened NDCs are viable mechanisms that are less extreme and therefore more acceptable than grandfathering, which favors the most fossil-intensive economies, or equal per capita allocation, which favors low-income countries that use less fossil fuel.","[""abstract""]"

 <p>We show that several of the most important economic models of climate change produce climate dynamics inconsistent with the current crop of models in climate science. First, most economic models exhibit far too long a delay between an impulse of CO2 emissions and warming. Second, few economic models incorporate positive feedbacks in the carbon cycle, whereby CO2 uptake by carbon sinks diminishes at the margin with increasing cumulative CO2 uptake and temperature. These inconsistencies affect economic prescriptions to abate CO2 emissions. Controlling for how the economy is represented, different climate models result in significantly different optimal CO2 emissions. A long delay between emissions and warming leads to optimal carbon prices that are too low and too much sensitivity of optimal carbon prices to the discount rate. Omitting positive carbon cycle feedbacks also leads to optimal carbon prices that are too low. We conclude it is important for policy purposes to bring economic models in line with the state of the art in climate science.</p>

We address this question by assessing the financial impacts and macroeconomic implications of carbon pricing and public subsidies. More specifically, we evaluate the extent to which such policies are sustainable by computing the probability of remaining below two thresholds that we argue to be indicative of the stability of our current economy and climate: (1) a temperature anomaly above +2°C (a commonly acknowledged target, including in the 2015 Paris Agreement, to potentially avoid nonlinearities in the climate system) and (2) a large global debt-to-output ratio of 270%. Key policy insights The upper-bound of the carbon pricing corridor advocated in the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices (2017. Report of the high-level commission on carbon prices. Washington, DC: World Bank), when implemented together with additional public subsidies on abatement costs in the private sector, is likely to successfully ensure sustainable economic growth by the end of the century. The probability that these climate policies will allow us to cap the average Earth temperature deviation at below +2.5°C by the end of this century is about 50%. Without a strong public commitment, the impact of climate change on gross output and capital, which captures nonlinear effects such as tipping points, appears to be powerful enough to pull the world economy towards a debt-deflationary field, potentially leading to forced degrowth in the second half of the twenty-first century.","[""abstract""]"

A two-stage stochastic programming model is constructed, in which the stochastic variable, CO2 price is modelled as a geometric Brownian motion process. Six scenarios are designed with respect to price expectation and volatility. A case study is performed with the GIS information of the plastic supply chain in Zhejiang province, China. The results illustrate that triggering the establishment of reverse logistics requires a carbon price threshold significantly beyond the current level. Lower price volatility would facilitate the decision-making of investment into the reverse logistics. Mechanisms to alleviate the market variation shall be introduced. A sound market condition is desired to obtain the optimal balance that encourages the CLSC without creating extra pressure on the firms.

Most recent carbon tax proposals provide for a domestic tax on fossil fuels at the point of extraction with border adjustments of the tax on imports and exports of products from energy-intensive sectors. The border adjustment of the tax would both protect domestic industries from unfair competition and prevent the “leakage” of emissions that would occur if production of energy-intensive goods shifted to jurisdictions without comparable carbon pricing. The prospect of new import fees and export rebates, however, has raised concerns about the potential for conflict with the rules of the World Trade Organization. 
 
The debate has centered on whether taxes on inputs that are used in the production process, but are not incorporated in the final product, may be border adjusted. The question of whether governments may regulate imported products based on “process or production methods” (“PPMs”) that do not affect the physical properties of the products has played a central role in discussions of the relationship between international trade rules and environmental measures over the last three decades. The WTO rules addressing the border adjustment of taxes, however, have a different and much older provenance. Governments have border adjusted consumption taxes for more than two centuries. The relevant WTO rules were drafted to accommodate this practice with regard not only to taxes on finished products but also to taxes on inputs used in the production process. Accordingly, border adjustments for carbon taxes are a WTO-consistent policy tool that can be used as part of the broader efforts to address climate change.","[""abstract""]"

As a standard SCA would build on existing accounting principles to require commercial organizations to report on how they will manage the costs of becoming net carbon zero compliant. SCA does not include carbon pricing or the cost of offsets. It would require the commercial organization to establish the costs of the transition to carbon neutrality. Regulatory requirements, enmeshment in transnational standards, and adequate auditing would implement SCA.

The ecosystem services and biodiversity that forests provide will be influenced by the behaviors of numerous individual private landowners as they alter their use of forests in response to climate change and any future carbon pricing policies that emerge. We evaluated the impact of forest landowners’ likely adaptation behaviors on potential habitat for 35 terrestrial, forest-dependent vertebrates across three U.S. Pacific states. In particular, we couple a previously estimated empirical-economic model of forest management with spatially explicit species’ range and habitat associations to quantify the effects of adaptation to climate change and carbon pricing on potential habitat for our focal species (amphibians, birds and mammals) drawn from state agency lists of species of conservation concern. We show that both climate change and carbon pricing policies would likely encourage adaptation away from currently prevalent coniferous forest types, such as Douglas-fir, largely through harvest and planting decisions. This would reduce potential habitat for a majority of the focal species we studied across all three vertebrate taxa. The total anticipated habitat loss for amphibians, birds and mammals considered species of state concern would exceed total habitat gained, and the net loss in habitat per decade would accelerate over time. Carbon payments to forest landowners likely would lead to unintended localized habitat losses especially in Douglas-fir dominant forest types, and encourage more hardwoods on private forest lands. Our study highlights potential tradeoffs that could arise from pricing one ecosystem service (e.g., carbon) while leaving others (e.g., wildlife habitat) unpriced. Our study demonstrates the importance of anticipating potential changes in ecosystem services and biodiversity resulting from forest landowners’ climate adaptation behavior and accounting for a broader set of environmental benefits and costs when designing policies to address climate change.","[""abstract""]"

The aim is to demonstrate the potential impacts of carbon taxation policy in a non-optimised economy. Context Carbon taxes are often presented as a favoured policy for tackling climate change (Kaufman 2018). Such a policy internalises (through the price mechanism) the externality of the contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to climate change. The High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices (Stiglitz and Stern 2017) concludes that imposing a cost on carbon is the most economically efficient way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep global temperature increases within the targets of the Paris agreement. The advantages of a carbon tax are that it can have a relatively simple design (although, as the Washington State example shows, revenue recycling design is a key component), the price certainty provided and that, in theory, there is a straightforward relationship between the level of the tax and the quantity of emissions reduction achieved. However, many of these conclusions are based upon a neoclassical view of economics, whereby agents in markets operate ‘rationally’, with perfect information, and therefore markets themselves operate in an optimal fashion. While assessments have been carried out of the potential macroeconomic impacts of carbon taxes in the US (see, for example, (Diamond and Zodrow 2018)), these have typically utilised general equilibrium approaches, which are based upon similar assumptions as to the rationality of agents and the optimality of markets. In this paper, we instead apply an econometric energy-environment-economy model, built upon a post-Keynesian framework, to assess the macroeconomic impacts of carbon taxes. Neoclassical economics discusses carbon taxes from the cost perspective; however, there is a substantial body of evidence that environmental taxation can have a positive impact on economic growth and competitiveness (European Environment Agency 2012) (The Ex’tax Project 2016) (OECD 2017). This can potentially bolster the arguments in favour of the introduction of a carbon tax; if such a policy can increase employment, and raise household incomes, alongside reducing emissions and reducing other taxes (as with I-732) or promoting a better natural environment (I-1631), then it may prove more attractive to the population. In November 2016, Washington Initiative 732 (I-732) was rejected in a state-wide ballot across Washington State. The initiative sough to introduce a carbon tax on the use of fossil fuels, starting at $15 per tonne in 2017, rising to $25/t in 2018 and from there increasing steadily to $100/t (all in 2016 $, i.e. adjusted for inflation). The revenues from the carbon tax were to be used to cut taxes – reducing state sales tax by 1%, funding the working families tax rebate (a tax credit for low-income households) and reducing taxes on (manufacturing) businesses. This method of revenue-recycling; using them to cut existing taxes, and therefore not increase overall government revenues; was deemed to be the most politically acceptable, in the sense that it does not increase the overall scale of government activities, while also reducing the tax burden on the lowest earning households. Despite the tax being set at a relatively low level (compared to those often shown to be required to meet broader climate change goals), designed in a way which would minimise impacts on lowincome households, and in a way that ensured that there was no increase in the role of the state in the economy, the initiative was defeated by 59.3% to 40.7%. A subsequent alternative measure (I1631), which sought to address some of the perceived shortcomings of I-732 – by reducing the level of the tax, and using the revenues to invest in clean technologies and environmental projects – was also defeated, in November 2018, by 56.3% to 43.7%. It is therefore clear that these measures lie on the unacceptable side on the question of political feasibility, at least at the time that the question was put to voters. The defeat of these measures can be seen as something of a litmus test for carbon taxes in the current political climate – and their defeat suggests that the introduction of such measures in the near future is going to be extremely challenging. Washington State was identified by the Carbon Tax Center as a ‘promising’ state for the deployment of carbon tax initiatives, alongside seven others (Bauman and Komanoff 2017). Despite this, such policy measures continue to be explored by state actors; for example ten states continue to operate within the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). A key question for future policy in this area therefore is what level of carbon taxation can feasibly be approved by voters (either directly, as was the case in Washington State, or indirectly, whereby an elected figure will only support a carbon tax policy that will not lead to them being ousted at the next election), and what are the emissions reduction that such a policy could achieve; most fundamentally, is the emissions reduction worth the political capital that would have to be expended to realise such a policy? Method The modelling in this paper has been done using a new energy-environment-economy model, E3-US. E3-US is a macroeconomic model designed to assess energy-economy linkages within the US at the state level. The model follows the approach developed over many years in Cambridge Econometrics’ global E3ME model. The model is designed to capture the energy, economic and environmental impacts of potential policies. It is a macro-econometric simulation model, meaning that it is based upon a series of econometric equations estimated based upon historical relationships, built within a national accounts framework. The model captures the impact of policy within the economy or energy system, and feedbacks between these systems allow the assessment of both direct effects (e.g. changes in energy demand as a result of price changes) and indirect effects (e.g. the employment and value added impacts from changing energy demand, and how those impact consumer incomes/expenditures and effects cascade through the state/national/global economy). It has been designed in such a way that different carbon tax rates can be applied to different groups of energy users, and so that revenues collected from such policies can be used for different purposes, including reducing other tax rates or funding energy efficiency programs. Figure 1 shows how the three components (modules) of the model energy, environment and economy fit together. Each component is shown in its own box. Each data set has been constructed by statistical offices to conform with accounting conventions. For each state’s economy the exogenous factors are economic policies (including tax rates, growth in government expenditures, interest rates and exchange rates). For the energy system, the outside factors are the world oil prices and energy policy (including regulation of the energy industries). For the environment component, exogenous factors include policies such as reduction in CO2 emissions tax. The linkages between the components of the model are shown explicitly by the arrows that indicate which values are transmitted between components. The economy module provides measures of economic activity and general price levels to the energy module; the energy module provides measures of emissions of the main air pollutants to the environment module. The energy module provides detailed price levels for energy carriers distinguished in the economy module and the overall price of energy as well as energy use in the economy. Figure 1 E3 linkages in the E3-US model Treatment of inter-state and international trade In a sub-national model, trade represents a major issue in assessing regional economic impacts. Demand in each state can be met either by production within that state, production in another state in the US, or production in another country. The approach can be summarized as: • econometric estimation of state’s sectoral international import demand • econometric estimation of state’s sectoral international export demand • trade between states is estimated using production shares (export) and domestic demand shares (import)","[""abstract""]"

In order to quantify and examine the merits of incorporating APs into decentralised wastewater treatment for the UK water sector, a flowsheet modelling approach has been adopted to compare an AP flowsheet to a current standard decentralised flowsheet. An example works of 2,000 PE was chosen with a per capita flow rate of 200 L d and a weak strength wastewater to reflect combined sewerage influent. Life-cycle cost assessment (LCCA) was conducted on the two flowsheets assuming a 20 year M&E asset life. Negative energy balances were calculated for both flowsheets, but the AP flowsheet required the least additional energy demand, as 56 % was offset by on-site energy generation. The desludge frequency calculated for the AP was 2 years, reducing tankering visits to site from 240 for the conventional flowsheet to 10 for the AP over the 20 year period, providing significant savings in O&M costs and carbon emissions. Over the 20 year LCCA, the TF and AP flowsheets were very similar in costs, at £240,481 and £252,749, respectively. Interestingly, the commonly cited prohibitive factor of APs, the costs associated with extended land requirements, were found to be negligible for the case of rural bare land sites. With rising energy and carbon prices putting pressure on the water sector to find alternative solutions for WWT in decentralised areas, APs may present a new approach to reduce the current burden of maintenance and sludge handling requirements.","[""abstract""]"

Such balance is achieved through effective control and planning over resources and conditions. The mathematical optimization framework developed in this body of work can be found in chapters 1 and 2 while their applications are developed in chapters 3 and 4. Chapter 1, introduce for the first time the Infinite Dimensional State-Space (IDEAS) based synthesis of reactor networks featuring multiple residence time distribution (MRTD) models in chapter 1. IDEAS is shown to be applicable to the MRTD synthesis problem containing a combination of Plug Flow reactor (PFR), Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR) and Segregated Laminar Flow Reactor (SLFR). The formulation which synthesis reactor networks featuring multiple residence time distribution (MRTD) guarantees global optimality through IDEAS based properties. Case studies featuring the Trambouze reaction scheme are carried out using the different reactor combinations and multiple selectivity and economical constraints.Chapter 2, presents for the first time a design and synthesize framework for the minimum number of units reactor networks with multiple Residence time density functions of diffrent reactor types using the Infinite Dimensional State-Space (IDEAS) method. The works combines the usage of Plug Flow Reactor (PFR) and Continuous Stirred-Tank Reactor (CSTR) in constructing the reactor networks using an IDEAS based Mixed Integer Linear Programing (MILP) formulation. Case studies featuring the Trambouze reaction scheme are carried out based on multiple process specification. This work expands the real life application potential of the work presented in chapter 1.In chapter 3, the newly developed concept of process energetics is applied to Steam Methane Reforming (SMR) to overcome the highly endothermic load challenge. The resulting process termed Energetically Enhanced Steam Methane Reforming (EESMR) is a non combustion process which means that the process related GHG emissions will receive favorable treatment in national carbon pricing programs. Chapter 4 presents an energetically self-sufficient process with zero carbon dioxide emissions for the production of electricity and chemicals from natural gas. The choice of product can be made based on environmental and economical constraints explained within the chapter. Natural Gas Chemical Power System (NGCPS) provides flexibility of choice when it comes to producing electricity, formic acid and hydrogen. The work further covers the environmental impact of thermochemical cycles in power production.","[""abstract""]"

with External and Internal Influencing Factors
Considered Comprehensively:
A Case Study from China","2020","5","With the continuous emission of greenhouse gases, the carbon trading market has become a powerful weapon to contain it. It is indispensable to analyze the carbon price of China that acts as the largest emitter of carbon dioxide worldwide. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative hybrid carbon price forecasting model that incorporates fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition (FEEMD) and extreme learning machine optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO-ELM) with external and internal influencing factors considered. The original carbon price series are disassembled into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and one residual via FEEMD. The PSO-ELM is then employed to forecast the sub-series. It’s remarkable that the inputs of the PSO-ELM model are divided into external and internal influencing factors. Factor analysis is used to extract potential factors from energy prices, macroeconomics and other influencing factors associated with the original carbon price as external influencing factors, and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is exploited to select internal influencing factors. A case study in Hubei Province, China shows that the proposed carbon price forecasting model is superior to the contrast models in terms of the smallest prediction error (MAE = 0.1274 yuan, MAPE = 0.8368%) and the strongest stability (RMSE = 0.0116 yuan). And the forecasting results demonstrate that the developed model with external and internal influencing factors considered can highly improve carbon price prediction performance and have potential in a wider range of carbon price forecasting. In addition, accurate carbon price forecasting can help the government realize macro control and the investors fulfill risk minimization.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Applying a representation of the earth system that captures the range of responses seen in complex earth system models invalidates the original article's implications for climate policy. The least-cost policy path that limits warming to 2°C implies that the carbon price starts high and increases at the interest rate.

All parties ratifying the Paris Agreement have submitted Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), many stating emission reduction targets. The international climate research community has designed five different Shared Socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) to characterize various possibilities in demographic and economic changes over the next century. These SSPs were implemented by six integrated assessment model (IAM) teams, which also determined the carbon price trajectory required to limit the temperature rise below 2°C in respective SSPs. In SSP5, also termed the fossil-fueled development scenario, only three IAMs identified that the 2°C target would be feasible, with carbon prices ranging from 220 to 518 US$/tCO2e in 2050. This study aims to analyse the effects of these carbon prices on energy and emissions during 2015–2050 in Nepal. It does so using a long-term energy system model using the framework of the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/Enduse (AIM/Enduse) modelling tool. The base case scenario and three carbon price scenarios are developed. Primary energy supply, energy security, energy technology-mix (especially renewable energy usage and hydropower development), emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and local pollutants, and local/regional environmental co-benefits are compared between the base case scenario and carbon price scenarios. The study finds that the implementation of a carbon tax would promote domestic hydropower, improve energy-efficiency and reduce imports of fossil fuels when compared to the base case. Hydropower-based electricity would have a major role in reducing emissions. Key policy insights The carbon prices in SSP5 determined by IAMs to achieve the 2°C target would be sufficient to achieve Nepal’s targets under its NDC in the energy sector. The industry and transport sectors would offer the highest GHG emission reduction. Hydropower and biomass would have major roles in decarbonizing the energy system.","[""abstract""]"

For this to be met, emissions must be net-zero by 2050. The transition to predominantly renewable electricity generation, aided by ever improving costs and the increasing role of digital technology, is happening, but not quickly enough. Reducing the consumption and demand for energy are now vitally important, as they will result in a decrease of the rate required for decarbonizing the power supply.

Their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were quantified by using life cycle assessments (LCA) and their economic viabilities were determined by comparing their minimum selling prices with fossil references’ market prices. A bottom up mathematical optimization model, BioENergy OPTimization (BENOPT) was used to investigate the GHG abatement potential and the corresponding abatement costs for the biochemicals up to 2050. BENOPT determines the optimal biomass allocation pathways based on maximizing GHG abatement under resource, capacity, and demand constraints. The identified biochemicals were bioethylene, succinic acid, polylactic acid (PLA), and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA). Results show that only succinic acid is economically competitive. Bioethylene which is the least performing in terms of economics breaks even at a carbon price of 420 euros per ton carbon dioxide equivalent (€/tCO2eq). With full tax waivers, a carbon price of 134 €/tCO2eq is necessary. This would result in positive margins for PHA and PLA of 12% and 16%, respectively. From the available agricultural land, modeling results show high sensitivity to assumptions of carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration in biochemicals and integrated biochemicals production. GHG abatement for scenarios where these assumptions were disregarded and where they were collectively taken into account increased by 370% resulting in a 75% reduction in the corresponding GHG abatement costs.","[""abstract""]"

There has been little investigation of the potential to combine supply from variable renewable energy sources with dispatchable supply from nuclear and flexible support from fossil gas, to provide supply that is reliable, affordable and very low in greenhouse gas. Identifying potentially cost-optimal combinations for the future is challenging. The relative cost of different generating technologies continues to change, and lack of transparency in the use of levelised cost of electricity can obscure assumptions that weight cost outcomes. Here we model supply to meet the hourly electricity demand projected for Australia's NEM in 2030 using different combinations of nuclear power and renewable energy sources (hydro, wind and solar photovoltaic), with open-cycle gas to ensure reliability. We optimised our results for the lowest average dynamic levelised cost of electricity, using different cost ratios to represent changing technology costs. We openly disclose our levelised cost assumptions. Using nuclear, wind, solar and gas, our model found a fully reliable electricity supply with emissions intensity of < 100 g CO2-e kWh-1, can be provided at AU$86-$94 MWh-1 (2020 values) with no carbon price. Cheaper supply from wind and solar lowers the average cost, but only slightly increases their proportional contribution to the cost-optimal supply. The results suggest a nuclear power sector of approximately 15,000 MW could underpin a clean supply with greatly expanded contribution from wind and solar. Frequency control would be maintained by synchronous nuclear generation, however greatly expanded transmission networks would be required. Further cost-reduction would require lower-cost nuclear generation.","[""abstract""]"

TNDB area is a forest dedicated to conserve the culture of Suku Anak Dalam (SAD or also known as Kubu People, a group of indigenous people of Jambi). The hollistic economic assessment of the present research is to estimate the benefits and cost to build a palm oil plantation in TNBD. The benefits consist of the benefits having palm trees and the woods whereas the cost consists of the cost to build a palm oil plantation, the cost to produce wood, the environmental cost, and the cost of the decline of indigenous culture. In this regard, the environmental cost refers to the erotion cost and the carbon release cost. On the other hand, the cost of indigenous culture’s decline consists of the lost of SAD’s culture from the perspective of community’s users, the lost of SAD’s culture from the perspective of indigenous people, and the lost of SAD’s culture from the perspective of non users’ community (NBG). The assessment techniques apply the formula and benefit’s shift to obtain the value palm oil plantation. The SAD’s culture from the perspective of community’s users is assessed from the cultural tourism of SAD and estimated with TCM. The SAD’s culture from the perspective of indigenous people is estimated with CVM. SAD’s culture from the perspective of non users’ community (NBG) is also estimated with CVM.

Choices about revenue use will turn on the complex interaction of political strategies, the broader fiscal picture, equity and economic concerns, and environmental considerations. The ultimate choice will mold policymakers’ promises to constituents and the public as they describe and promote carbon taxes. Those promises become particularly important when they purport to dedicate the revenue to a specific purpose. Voters and stakeholders will wonder whether promises can and will be kept. Can the revenue actually be put into a secure lockbox to ensure that the revenue is used as promised? Will that lockbox endure over time? <br><br>This article considers the legal durability of promises to earmark carbon tax revenue. It focuses on three types of revenue dedication: revenue-neutral tax reform, revenue recycling through “dividends” or rebates, and dedication of revenue to spending on climate-related matters. It explores the legal design of these alternatives. It also analyzes how the legal context, such as budget rules and procedures, may influence whether promises are kept in the short and long terms. While drawing on examples of carbon pricing measures and proposals in North America, the article strives to identify issues that may apply in other countries as well. Regardless of jurisdiction, policymakers and carbon tax advocates should consider whether their rhetorical promises can translate into legally durable reality. The article does not advocate for specific policy or political choices about how to use carbon tax revenue. It seeks instead to help inform choices and future research.","[""abstract""]"

Using analysis and prediction, the mechanism of the carbon market could be improved and correct guidance from relevant policies might be provided. To improve the accuracy of prediction, a hybrid model based on factor analysis, empirical mode decomposition, improved particle swarm optimization, and the least squares support vector machine is proposed in this article to use when considering the historical carbon price and external factors affecting the carbon price. First, factor analysis is conducted to extract special factors as input variables. Then, the original carbon price sequences are decomposed by empirical mode decomposition. Ultimately, the least squares support vector machine optimized by improved particle swarm optimization is employed to calculate each sequence, and the final predicted result is integrated by the forecasting results of each sequence. Based on three typical carbon markets in China, the results show that the hybrid model is more accurate than comparable models when forecasting carbon prices combined with various factors.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

The aim of this paper, which focuses on direct and indirect carbon emissions, is to study the economic value of the carbon emission reduction of bus electrification in an operational lifecycle carbon footprint, with the empirical data sourced from the bus electrification in Macau. First, it proposes the methodology to evaluate the operational lifecycle carbon value of bus electrification (OLCVBE). Second, it analyses the distinct impacts of internal determinants on OLCVBE. Third, it discusses the determinants’ characteristics for OLCVBE. The results indicate that (1) OLCVBE may be a carbon debt, but it is not a carbon asset in some situations; (2) OLCVBE is determined by the carbon emission coefficients of both electric power and fossil fuel, buses’ electric or fossil fuel consumption levels, buses’ terminations, carbon price and discounted rate; and (3) as a comparison, electric power’s embedded carbon emission coefficient has the biggest impact on OLCVBE, then carbon price and the electric consumption have the second or third biggest impacts, and the annual driving distance of buses has relative less impact. This paper provides a new perspective to study the economic and environmental effects of bus electrification.","[""abstract""]"

It is the basis for formulating market policies and improving risk management capabilities. China's carbon price series are nonlinear and nonstationary, so it is difficult to predict accurately with traditional models. This paper proposes a multiscale ensemble prediction model based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD‐ADD) to improve the prediction accuracy of carbon price. Firstly, EEMD is used to decompose the carbon price sequence into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs), and these IMFs are divided into high‐frequency component, low‐frequency component and the trend component. Then, LSSVM, PSO‐LSSVM, and BA‐LSSVM are used to predict the three components respectively after comparative analysis. Finally, the results are combined to obtain the final prediction value. In the empirical analysis of the Hubei Emissions Exchange, the proposed model outperforms other comparative models. The RMSE, MAE, and MAPE values of the EEMD‐ADD model are 0.6180, 0.4726, and 1.6342, and the DS, CP, and CD values are 94.36, 92.16, and 96.48. In addition, the model performed best in other time periods. The results suggest that the proposed model is effective and could predict carbon prices more accurately.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

To accommodate the variability of renewable generation, flexibility in the network is vital. An important flexibility option is grid scale electricity storage. 
A simulation is made of the electricity system with variable renewable generation, electricity storage and flexible high carbon generators, assumed to be gas CCGT, for various UK scenarios. The simulation uses historical hourly meteorology to drive models of demand and renewable variation, and the consequent input/output operation of storage and dispatchable generation to balance differences between demand and renewables. A marginal cost method is devised to calculate the storage, renewable and dispatching capacity and operational costs incurred in each hour. These cost structures can form a transparent economic base for informing market design and setting prices for use in energy system models. 
Results show that while marginal costs for renewable generation are relatively low, reliance on battery storage for backup particularly during peak periods can result in high electricity prices and without a significant increase in projected fossil fuel or carbon prices, traditional high carbon electricity generators will still be cheaper to operate. This work will be used to analyse the interaction between district heating with thermal energy storage and heat pumps, and the electricity system.","[""abstract""]"

Alberta has transitioned from an output-based allocation system for industrial emitters to a hybrid system combining a carbon levy and refined output-based system. Québec and Ontario have implemented cap-and-trade systems, linked to California. Recognizing these existing systems, rather than impose a single carbon pricing mechanism, the Pan-Canadian Approach to Carbon Pricing gives provinces and territories the flexibility to adopt a carbon tax, a hybrid system, or a cap-and-trade system. To address concerns relating to ‘fairness’ and equivalency of carbon price, a federal carbon pricing benchmark establishes criteria relating to minimum ‘common scope’ and ‘increases in stringency’ that provincial and territorial carbon pricing systems must meet.

Furthermore, we show that the abating region has an inverse N-shaped emission path, with growing emissions in the period for which the ceiling is binding. In addition, there is a phase in which this region has a positive carbon price, but higher emissions than the non-abating region.

For empirical simulation, we build a computable general equilibrium model of China’s economy and introduce Structural Decomposition Analysis to link both the theoretical and empirical models. When imposing a carbon price on the electricity generation sector, our results show significant carbon leakage.

Instead, this paper assumes that the private sector is skeptical about the science of climate change and adheres to distorted subjective beliefs regarding the probability distribution governing global temperatures. Further, these private beliefs are assumed to be unknown and unknowable to the fiscal authority. This paper considers two cases: one in which the government knows the correct probability distribution of exogenous climate shocks and believes unknown private beliefs to be false, and one in which it does not know the true distribution nor private sector beliefs, which, however, it it believes to be correct. The government's ignorance about beliefs and/or about the model leads it to add a worst case premium to the conventional measure of the social cost of carbon that typically anchors carbon taxes in the literature. Furthermore, the difference in beliefs produces a positive gap between the government's and the private sector's stochastic discount factors potentially justifying a further premium on the carbon tax as well as a subsidy on capital. The results are presented within the context of robust asset pricing theory that allows framing the problem in terms of Arrow-Debreu state-contingent carbon prices to show that the optimal carbon tax is the same as the permit price of an underlying asset --- the government-imposed cap on emissions in economies with cap and trade.","[""abstract""]"

We propose a carbon pricing model linked to crude oil prices, which has historically been employed in supply-side driven pricing of long-term contracts for energy trading in the early stage. Since the model is designed to hold carbon prices between certain lower and upper boundaries using S-shaped carbon price linkage to crude oil prices, it can be useful to overcome a recent low carbon price issue. In addition, it is shown that the model can alleviate the difficulties of carbon derivative pricing in selecting market price of risk. Empirical studies using EUA and Brent crude oil futures prices estimate the parameters of the Brent crude oil-linked EUA price model. EUA prices simulated from the model with the parameter estimates are compared with historical EUA prices. The results suggest that simulated EUA prices from the model be kept relatively higher than historical EUA prices. This is preferable for accelerating carbon emission reductions in that emission reduction technologies with high marginal abatement costs are affordable. It may imply that EUA must be priced using a crude oil-linked carbon price model in the early stage of EUA trading until EUA markets are fully matured from the supply-side perspective for carbon asset pricing, not employing a premature market-based or supply and demand-based carbon price model. To show usefulness of crude oil-linked carbon pricing, we also give a numerical example of European carbon option pricing based on the Brent crude oil-linked EUA price model by using Crank-Nicolson finite difference method. Finally we discuss the relation between crude oil-linked carbon pricing and emission reduction risk. These studies may suggest carbon policy makers take into account of crude oil-linked carbon pricing to tackle low price and low liquidity issues of carbon assets.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Using spot and futures prices, we calculate an implied cost of carry. Using sequential futures prices, we calculate the implied forward cost of carry. Under the rules of the ETS, the cost of carry is - with some exceptions - just the opportunity cost of money, so that the term structure of the cost of carry should exactly equal the term structure interest rates. However, we show that spot carbon allowances were originally expensive relative to futures, but since late 2008 the situation reversed and spot carbon allowances have been persistently cheap relative to futures prices. That is, the return to holding a carbon allowance together with a short futures position was originally less than the interest rate, but since late 2008 has been much greater than the interest rate. The same result holds throughout the term structure: shorter maturity futures are cheap relative to longer maturity futures. This relationship is puzzling and deserves attention. It may reveal important facts about market expectations for the evolution of EU-ETS rules related to the banking of allowances across years. We fit the term structure of carbon prices to a popular model of the term structure of interest rates, and find a very different structure. Again our term structure analysis points to the theory not holding.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

The measures, which would primarily apply to basic materials like steel and cement, pursue a double objective: they are aimed at enhancing the effectiveness of carbon pricing for the transition to climate neutrality but also at avoiding carbon leakage risks. When implementing carbon adjustment mechanisms and alternative measures, various design options might be considered to reform the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). In this paper, we have decided to focus on three main models, which help to highlight the main differences between the available options. Under the first model, importers of basic materials would be required to surrender carbon allowances at the level of a product benchmark or, where lower, at the verified level of foreign carbon intensity. In parallel, allocation of free allowances would be phased out. Under the second model, a symmetric adjustment mechanism for exports and imports would be adopted, including refund to exporters for the carbon costs incurred on basic materials embodied in products. Finally, under the third model, the EU ETS would be complemented with a climate contribution charged for materials sold in the European Union (EU) at the product benchmark level related to the carbon intensity of each material. The free allowance allocation regime would then be modified to be directly linked to the volume of material production at the product benchmark level. In order to contribute to the current policy debate, we evaluate for each of these three models, their legality, coherence with EU climate objectives, effectiveness in carbon leakage prevention, potential international implications, as well as their administrative complexity and compliance costs.","[""abstract""]"

The University of Houston EENR Center, the UH Energy Initiative, and the Duke University Energy Initiative worked to bring scholars in taxation, climate, environment, and energy together to discuss the state of possibilities for federal carbon pricing. This document is a snapshot of the discussion points and conclusions from that meeting. In essence, a carbon tax now seems more likely than it would have been in 2010, but the passage of such a tax is unlikely as a stand alone item in the near future in the United States.","[""abstract""]"

A key factor affecting the impact of these taxes is whether they are based on the carbon content of imports or the carbon content in domestic production. Our quantitative estimates suggest that the former action when applied to all merchandise imports would address competitiveness and environmental concerns in high income countries but with serious consequences for trading partners. For example, China’s manufacturing exports would decline by one-fifth and those of all low- and middle-income countries by 8 percent; the corresponding declines in real income would be 3.7 percent and 2.4 percent. In contrast, border tax adjustment based on the carbon content in domestic production, especially if applied to both imports and exports, would broadly address the competitiveness concerns of producers in high income countries without seriously damaging developing-country trade. Therefore, as part of a comprehensive agreement on climate change, new WTO rules could be negotiated that would prohibit the extreme form of action while possibly allowing trade actions based on domestic carbon content as a safety valve.","[""abstract""]"

While the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) points to industry as a high-carbon pollutant end-use sector, it is already efficient in some respects. This is a product of dozens if not hundreds of years of improvement in motors and heat and steam production. Industry plays a declining role in the United States in terms of energy use. Yet industrial carbon emissions reductions must mirror deep decarbonization goals that are set for other sectors in order to hold global average temperature increases within 2°C. And while there are hundreds of cost-effective energy-efficiency measures that manufacturing subsectors such as iron and steel and cement and lime could adopt, firms often ignore them. These challenges demand a diverse array of legal and policy responses. This chapter outlines a suite of legal pathways that must be pursued in concert to achieve massive carbon emissions reductions across key energy-intensive industries in the United States. To stand a chance of meeting IPCC, Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project, and other carbon emissions budgets for 2050 and beyond, we will need to pursue not only process efficiency, fuel switching, and energy supply decarbonization (e.g., low-carbon electricity generation, electricity balancing), but also the efficiency of products and their broader production systems, challenges of material efficiency, carbon management, and industrial symbiosis. Legal pathways for process efficiency improvement and fuel switching require a portfolio of legal innovations that begins with a carbon price. A carbon price can be set through a tax or indirectly through market mechanisms that respond to emissions standards. Emissions standards can be set on an ad hoc or cross-sector basis under sections 111 and 115 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), respectively. I contrast these “sectoral” and “comprehensive” approaches as they apply to energy-intensive industry subsectors, including refining and chemicals, iron and steel and other primary metals, cement and lime, pulp and paper, and food processing. Under the sectoral approach, new source performance standards can be set and periodically revised to encourage near- and mid-term process improvements that I outline for each subsector. I point out the limits of a sectoral approach as implemented by federal or state agencies and recommend pursuit of a more comprehensive carbon price through section 115 of the CAA. Carbon trading in response to rulemaking under section 115 should be supplemented by a mix of federal subsidies and private law solutions that increase flexibility in how emissions targets are met. They can also spur greater technology adoption or innovation at different points along the carbon abatement cost curve. I describe programs such as an innovation fund, a sectoral crediting mechanism to address emissions leakage within industry subsectors, and improved motor and boiler minimum efficiency performance standards (MEPS) to limit cross-sector leakage under a section 115-enacted ETS. Because energy efficiency gains will soon approach natural limits in some industry subsectors, I turn to the broader supply chain for additional emissions reduction that can be achieved through product-based measures (such as lightweighting and material substitution) and systems design (such as carbon management and industrial symbiosis). Here again, a variety of legal tools are available, including product standard legislation modeled after the EU’s Eco-Design Directive; amendment or repeal of materially-inefficient MEPS and manufacturing subsidies; updated building standards; green public procurement; federal programs to inventory, subsidize, and standardize recycling, industrial linkage, and co-processing technologies; and facilitated industrial symbiosis agreements that adopt resource synergies within industrial parks and enterprise groups. I close with a discussion of environmental justice concerns that are raised when carbon emissions and their co-pollutants are traded or otherwise redistributed across cities and regions.","[""abstract""]"

We consider different policy proposals that can support the carbon price either by intervening on the ETS cap (-30%, set-aside, carbon central bank, long-term reduction targets) or directly on the carbon price (national and EU price floor). In detail, each proposal is examined according to six criteria that allow us to capture and compare their economic, regulatory and procedural implications, so as to determine which options would not only be feasible but also most effective. We conclude that the introduction of a price stabilization mechanism allowing for a reversible adjustment of the ETS cap according to clear, pre-defined rules by an independent authority such as a carbon central bank would be the most effective option to reduce not only the current shortcomings of the ETS but also reinforce the mechanism to avoid similar problems in the future. The establishment of a EU-wide price floor would represent a second-best solution. The worst options appear to be those involving an overall increase in target reduction to 30% and a price floor in its national version, as currently implemented in UK. Finally, we conclude that the setting of post-2020 targets is not a mutually exclusive option, and could be adopted in any case to increase the regulatory certainty of the system.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Deforestation emissions are partly offset by forest expansion and increases in growing stock primarily in the extra-tropical north. Innovative financial mechanisms would be required to help reducing deforestation. Using a spatially explicit integrated biophysical and socio-economic land use model we estimated the impact of carbon price incentive schemes and payment modalities on deforestation. One payment modality is adding costs for carbon emission, the other is to pay incentives for keeping the forest carbon stock intact. Results: Baseline scenario calculations show that close to 200mil ha or around 5% of today's forest area will be lost between 2006 and 2025, resulting in a release of additional 17.5 GtC. Today's forest cover will shrink by around 500 million hectares, which is 1/8 of the current forest cover, within the next 100 years. The accumulated carbon release during the next 100 years amounts to 45 GtC, which is 15% of the total carbon stored in forests today. Incentives of 6 US$/tC for the standing biomass paid every 5 years will bring deforestation down by 50%. This will cause costs of 34 billion US$/year. On the other hand a carbon tax of 12$/tC harvested forest biomass will also cut deforestation by half. The tax income will decrease from 6 billion US$ in 2005 to 4.3 billion US$ in 2025 and 0.7 billion US$ in 2100 due to decreasing deforestation speed. Conclusions: Avoiding deforestation requires financial mechanisms that make retention of forests economically competitive with the currently often preferred option to seek profits from other land uses. Incentive payments need to be at a very high level to be effective against deforestation. Taxes on the other hand will generate budgetary revenues by the regions which are already poor. A combination of incentives and taxes could turn out to be a viable solution for this dilemma. Increasing the value of forest land and thereby make it less easily prone to deforestation would act as a strong incentive to increase productivity of agricultural and fuelwood production, which could be supported by revenues generated by the deforestation tax.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

We compare the performance of various policy combinations for food and fuel prices, fuel mix and fuel consumption. We also analyze the economic costs and benefits of alternative policy combinations and their distributional effects for consumers and producers in the transportation and agricultural sector in the US. Using a dynamic, multi-market equilibrium, nonlinear mathematical programming model of the transportation and agricultural sectors, we find that combining the RFS with an LCFS policy leads to a reduction in first generation biofuels and an increase in second generation biofuels compared to the RFS alone. This policy combination also achieves greater reduction in GHG emissions even after considering offsetting market mediated effects. Imposition of a carbon price with the RFS and LCFS policy primarily induces fuel conservation and achieves larger GHG emissions reduction compared to the other policy scenarios. All of these policy combination lead to higher net economic benefits for the transportation and agricultural sectors relative to the no policy baseline because they improve the terms of trade for these sectors.","[""abstract""]"

A large market asymmetry coupled with a small technology gap emerges as the only configuration in which unilateral climate policy leads to a fall in world emissions irrespective of the optimal location choice. Thus for being effective and not leading to production relocation, unilateral climate policy should be moderate, implemented by a sufficiently large area and complemented by mechanisms for promoting the international transfer of clean technologies.

A main observation in the workshop was that the forthcoming CPP will likely facilitate and complicate the prospect of comprehensive carbon pricing.

At first glance, intensity targets seem appealing as they foster the de-carbonization of production without ‘imposing constraints on growth.’ They can be differentiated to account for heterogeneity among participating countries, enhancing developing country participation. Taking a closer look at GHG-intensities, however, reveals some serious flaws. Intensities do not control the stock of atmospheric carbon, hence they may fail to prevent drastic climate change. But there are some more subtle problems. First of all, differentiated intensity targets are inefficient even with trade in carbon. To see the argument, suppose two nations, each producing its macro-output according to fi(ei), i = 1, 2. Regional emissions are denoted by ei , fi is the (concave) macro production function with emissions as sole explicit input. Let xidenote the intensity target, then ( ei–xi fi(ei)) are emissions to be bought on an international carbon market in order to cope with the intensity target. With q as carbon price, regional output maximization gives q = f ′ i (ei)/(1 − xif ′ i (ei)) as first order condition. Since q applies for both regions, f1′(e1)/(1−x1f ′ 1(e1)) = f ′ 2(e2)/(1−x2f ′ 2(e2)) holds in equilibrium. But efficient abatement requires that marginal abatement costs, −fi ′(ei), are equal in both regions. This is the case only for x1 = x2. Hence, differentiated intensity targets are inefficient even with international carbon trade. A second problem with intensity targets occurs when dropping the homogenous macro-output assumption of GDP. The denominator in computing intensities, GDP, is a highly aggregated variable involving the price system as aggregation device. In a forthcoming joint-paper with Benito Mueller ( Mu ller and Mueller-Furstenberger, 2002 ) we shall show that though all sectoral carbon intensities increase, the aggregated intensity may decline. This is due to changes in relative prices associated with structural change. Intensities are a convincing greening measure only as long as we abstract from the aggregate nature of the GDP. Carbon intensities are appealing at first glance but much more research is necessary to evaluate them as a substitute for internationally tradable carbon rights. Other options are more promising from a theoretical point of view. One of them is discussed in Stephan and Mueller-Furstenberger (2001) , where nations negotiate on their shares in future global emissions instead of regional carbon targets. With this option, even banking and borrowing of carbon rights might be compatible with sustainable carbon emission paths.","[""abstract""]"
"219596220","10.1080/21568316.2017.1366359","null","Editorial","2018","0","It is often said that the central problem with renewable energy is that it is intermittent and dealing with this will add substantially to the cost. But new insights from a range of recent studies suggest that this may not be the case. For example, since balancing systems allow variable energy supply and demand to be matched more efficiently and can avoid the need for expensive new generation, the UK National Infrastructure Commission’s influential new report ‘Smart Power’ says a mix of storage, smart grid demand management and supergrid interconnectors could save UK consumers up to £8bn p.a by 2030 (NIC 2016) So grid balancing can save money – not least by avoiding wasteful curtailment of surplus output but also by trading net excesses. There will clearly be costs for adding balancing systems. However, that will be offset by the resultant system-wide cost savings, and given technology development and higher carbon prices, the International Energy Agency says the scale and impact of the extra costs should fall dramatically (IEA 2014). The German Agora Energiewende group agrees, especially given the savings from reduced use of fossil fuel that will be enabled by wider use of renewables (Agora 2015). That goes against the more usual view that using and balancing variable renewables will add substantially to energy costs. It ties in with a recent study from the International Renewable Energy Agency suggesting that on-shore wind would be cheaper than anything else, even with full balancing costs added (IRENA 2015). It is also often claimed that renewables will need 100% fossil (and/or nuclear) backup. However, the influential Energy Research Partnership study says that, while backup will be needed, only a 12% fossil input would be required to meet occasional demand peaks in a hypothetical 100% UK renewable scenario with wind and PV solar meeting most electricity needs most of the time, assuming that the necessary balancing facilities were in place (ERP 2015). That translates to almost the same small fossil capacity figure as had been suggested as being needed in an earlier Poyry 2050 scenario, with renewables supplying 94% of electricity (Poyry 2011). The Pugwash 80% by 2050 UK renewables study came to a similar conclusion, although it suggested that the fossil residual could be reduced further using Power to Gas conversion of surpluses (Pugwash 2013). Other interesting recent technical insights in the balancing field include the fact that the impact of short-term solar PV output variations caused by clouds can be reduced if there are PV units scattered widely across a region and that heat storage is much more efficient than storage as electricity, and, with CHP plants, can aid flexible power and heat balancing. Like heat, gas (including green gas/syngas) can also be easily stored and for long periods, offering one way to deal with longer term lulls in renewable availability. Shorter term variations can be dealt with by other types of storage, demand response, smart grid and supergrid balancing, often at low cost. For example, as the aforementioned Pugwash UK study found, with around 100GW of wind capacity in place by 2050, there would be times when this generated a surplus that could be exported on the supergrid, potentially earning the UK £15bn p.a. Alternatively, some of the excess could be converted to hydrogen gas and other syngases, creating valuable new fuels for heating, grid balancing or use in vehicles – the so-called Power to Gas idea being developed in Germany. There are of course many uncertainties. These are mostly new technologies and they would be operating in new more interactive markets, with new types of smart grid/supergrid trading being needed. However, overall the emerging studies seem to conclude that balancing variable renewables may not be a major constraint on the expansion of the use of renewables or add unduly to the cost. In fact, the need to provide balancing may lead to a system that is more efficient overall and save money, not least since it would enable increasingly cheap renewables to expand to replace most if not all fossil and nuclear sources (Elliott 2016).","[""abstract""]"

I unravel the complexity of rebound in an international context, for which purpose the distinction between national and international rebound is introduced. The main climate–energy strategies and policies are assessed based on their capacity to control rebound, with carbon pricing – especially cap-and-trade – appearing to be the best approach. It is argued that motivations for further negotiations on amendments to the recent Paris climate agreement, namely on national policy coordination, can be strengthened by rebound concerns. As part of this, a new suggestion is to complement carbon equalization tariffs on carbon-intensive goods imported from countries with weak or non-existent climate policies with ‘revenue-recycling offsets’. These offsets would ease the political way to implementing carbon equalization tariffs, in turn creating pressure on countries to sign an effective climate treaty – a requirement to achieve consistent and serious carbon pricing worldwide. To support these arguments, the empirical patterns of rebound estimates are broadly outlined. Policy relevance Rebound is given scant attention in both IPCC documents and UNFCCC climate summits, where climate agreements are negotiated. This article argues that without an international climate treaty, or with a soft treaty in the form of voluntary pledges, as characterizes the recent Paris climate agreement, well-intended local and national climate strategies will seriously rebound in terms of CO2 emissions. This means that the motivations for climate negotiations can be strengthened by drawing attention to rebound concerns. The major current climate–energy strategies and policies are assessed on the basis of their capacity to control rebound, with carbon pricing – notably cap-and-trade – revealed to be the best approach. Further analysis and discussion of this is welcome, especially as rebound is neglected in the comparisons of carbon tax and emissions trading solutions to global warming. In particular, rebound should be added to the set of core criteria for judging and comparing instruments of climate policy. In addition, a new suggestion offered is to complement a climate club with carbon equalization tariffs on carbon-intensive goods imported from countries lacking strong climate policy with ‘revenue-recycling offsets’. This would make the implementation of such tariffs more politically feasible as well as creating pressure on countries to sign an effective climate treaty.","[""abstract""]"

In an effort to meet its obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, the European Union has introduced a cap‐and‐trade scheme where mandated companies are allocated permits to emit carbon dioxide.

There are many institutional features that potentially impact on carbon prices and associated financial futures, making such an undertaking quite different from modelling conventional financial assets traded in mature markets. We forecast the carbon markets by using dynamic model averaging, which is a recently developed statistical method which has three advantages over conventional approaches. First, it allows the coefficients on the predictors in a forecasting model to change over time. Second, it allows for the entire forecasting model to change over time. Third, it surmounts statistical problems which arise from the large number of potential predictors that can explain carbon prices. Our empirical results indicate that there are both important policy and statistical benefits with our approach. Statistically, we present strong evidence that there is substantial turbulence and change in the carbon markets. We find that dynamic model averaging can model these features and forecast accurately compared with conventional approaches.","[""abstract""]"

Defining baselines based on BAU and NDC targets is challenging as targets are uncertain, sometimes unclear or have only a limited scope. Benchmarks promise to be an efficient and simple solution. This builds on the rationale that stringent benchmarks lead to baselines that are automatically below both BAU and to an emission trajectory that is compliant with the host-country’s NDC target. This analysis indicates that even though there are sub-sectors with medium or large potential for benchmarking (e. g. industry process emissions), most emission sources cannot be covered by global benchmarks. The reason is that goods and services are heterogeneous, and emissions tend to depend on exogenous local factors. Furthermore, if stringent benchmarks are used in many sectors expected carbon prices may not be on a level that would trigger additional action. Benchmarking is therefore barely the silver bullet with respect to crediting baselines under the Paris Agreement. However, if one shifts the focus from global benchmarks towards a more efficient and robust approach of setting project-specific crediting baselines, the large body of methodological approaches and reference values from emission trading systems and the CDM can be of use nevertheless. Kurzbeschreibung Die Festlegung von Baselines mit weltweit anwendbaren und strengen Benchmarks kann ein wichtiges Instrument zur Ausweitung der Marktmechanismen gemäß Artikel 6 sein. Die Definition von Baselines auf Basis von BAUund NDC-Zielen ist eine Herausforderung, da die Ziele unsicher, manchmal unklar oder nur einen geringem Geltungsbericht haben. Benchmarks versprechen hierfür eine effiziente und einfache Lösung. Der Grund ist, dass strenge Benchmarks zu Baselines führen, die automatisch sowohl unterhalb der BAU liegen, als auch zu einer Emissionstrajektorie, die dem NDC-Ziel des Gastlandes entspricht. Auch wenn es Teilbereiche mit mittlerem oder großem Benchmarking-Potenzial gibt (z. B. Emissionen aus industriellen Prozessen), zeigt diese Analyse, dass die Mehrheit der Emissionsquellen nicht durch globale Benchmarks abgedeckt werden kann. Waren und Dienstleistungen sind heterogen und die Emissionen hängen tendenziell auch von exogenen lokalen Faktoren ab. Darüber hinaus dürfte der erwartete CO2-Preis in vielen Sektoren nicht auf einem Niveau liegen, das zusätzliche Maßnahmen auslösen würde, wenn strenge Benchmarks verwendet werden.

A timely and smooth transition to a low-carbon economy may be accomplished if businesses routinely disclose and manage carbon dioxide emissions subject to science-based targets along with climate-related financial risks and financial performance. Existing capital budgeting techniques can help create value sustainably by focusing on the opportunity costs of both financial capital and carbon dioxide thus improving the allocations of both financial and atmospheric capital. Business efforts in this area will be most effective if guided by supportive government policy. If the voluntary responses from businesses, consumers, investors and local policy-makers fail to meet the science-based deadline for carbon dioxide emission reduction, aggressive and globally enforced carbon pricing mechanisms and emissions restrictions may become necessary. To the extent the business community is unprepared for broad-based climate policy intervention individual firm balance sheets may become impaired. In this case the greater likelihood of financial insolvencies in carbon-intensive and related industries will challenge the stability of the global financial system. It is therefore imperative that the problem of financial institutions that are “too big to fail” be addressed expeditiously by reducing financial firms’ holdings of high-carbon assets.","[""abstract""]"

This requires a radical redirection and acceleration of technological change towards low- and particularly zero-carbon solutions. Global carbon pricing is seen as a key enabler for such decarbonization, with the European Union’s Emission Trading System (EU ETS) serving as an important pillar. In this paper, I therefore re-view the evidence on the innovation impact of the EU ETS. The review shows a very limited effect of the scheme on technological innovation, but there are clear signs of it having stimulated organizational innovation, with the impact being more pronounced for the electricity sector than for industry. The initially high expectations of the EU ETS regarding technological innovation largely dissipated once the scheme’s lack of strin-gency became apparent and prices collapsed accordingly. Also, for many of the rather incremental innovations that have taken place, the EU ETS was shown to be only one contributing factor among others, with the broader policy mix and long-term targets playing a particularly pivotal role in stimulating innovation. In contrast, there is clear evidence that the EU ETS has been a key driver of various organizational innovations, including making climate change a top management issue. However, so far, these or-ganizational innovations have only had limited effects on shifting corporate strategies towards low-carbon solutions because of low carbon prices, the relatively high share of free allocations in industry, and more pressing business concerns. Despite this, the scheme’s positive impact on organizational innovations should not be underestimated, as these constitute a necessary precondition for future technological innovations. The findings suggest that the Commission’s proposal for the fourth trading period of the EU ETS points in the right direction, but further efforts will be needed to significantly in-crease the scarcity of EU allowances and the share of auctioning in order to fully un-leash the scheme’s transformative power. If the identified shortcomings are not ad-dressed, the EU ETS cannot play its foreseen role in guiding the decarbonization of the European economy, for which innovations in low-carbon solutions are a fundamental requirement.","[""abstract""]"

Policy makers should set carbon prices to the SCC using a carbon tax or a competitive permits market. The social discount rate is lower and the SCC higher if policy makers are more patient and if future generations are less affluent and policy makers care about intergenerational inequality. Uncertainty about the future rate of growth of the economy and emissions and the risk of macroeconomic disasters (tail risks) also depress the social discount rate and boost the SCC provided intergenerational inequality aversion is high. Various reasons (e.g. autocorrelation in the economic growth rate or the idea that a decreasing certainty-equivalent discount rate results from a discount rate with a distribution that is constant over time) are discussed for why the social discount rate is likely to decline over time. A declining social discount rate also emerges if account is taken from the relative price effects resulting from different growth rates for ecosystem services and of labour in efficiency units. The market-based asset pricing approach to carbon pricing is contrasted with a more ethical approach to policy making. Some suggestions for further research are offered.","[""abstract""]"

Both countries' responses are compared to a similar carbon price schedule (US$10/tCO 2 e in 2013 rising exponentially to $100 by 2050) using a hybrid technologically explicit and behaviourally realistic model with macroeconomic feedbacks (CIMS). Then additional measures are imposed based on the national circumstances of each country; for Canada we simulate a 50% reduction by 2050, and stabilization for China. The scale of the challenge in all cases requires that every available option be vigorously pursued, including energy efficiency, fuel switching, carbon capture and storage, and accelerated development of renewables; to compensate, there are significant co-reductions of local air pollutants such as SO x and NO x . Finally, the abatement cost schedules of China and Canada are compared, and implications considered for carbon permit flows if the cost schedule of the rest of the developed world is assumed to be similar to that of Canada. We found that the developed world and China could collectively reduce emissions by 50% in 2050 at a price of $175/tCO 2 e, with permits flowing from the developed countries to China; while abatement costs are lower in China up to $75/t, at higher prices reductions are less costly in the developed world. Our results indicate that a global low-carbon society is feasible, on condition that policy makers are willing and able to impose long-term, credible policy packages with carbon pricing policy as the core element, coupled with supplementary regulations to address market failures.","[""abstract""]"

National assumptions about generation mixes are often applied at annual time steps, neglecting spatiotemporal resolutions that provide insights on impacts from time-variable emissions. Our grid-scale model incorporates details of transmission and generation planning that allows a geographically and temporally textured and more realistic assessment of the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions outcomes, using a case study of the Western Interconnection of North America. Results from a co-optimized model of generation, transmission, and operations - the Johns Hopkins Stochastic Multistage Integrated Network Expansion Model - provide a detailed characterization of twenty-one scenarios with different configurations of storage additions, new renewable capacity, and carbon prices. Life cycle results suggest that optimization models that focus on generation alone may underestimate emissions by 18-29% because only emissions from power generation are quantified (i.e., supply chain emissions are omitted), but also that carbon pricing is the predominant driver of reducing emissions in the scenarios we examine. Life cycle assessment of electricity generation should move beyond individual technologies towards capturing the influence of policies at the system level to better understand technology-policy dynamics for the grid.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Therefore, more effective policies should be implemented for the management of demolition waste. This study combines life cycle assessment (LCA) with life cycle costing (LCC) to analyze the environmental and economic drivers of three different waste disposal scenarios in Guangzhou, China, in the context of carbon trading: S1 (landfilling), S2 (recycled aggregate), and S3 (recycled powder). In this study, the carbon emissions of demolition waste were obtained by LCA, and the carbon emission cost was calculated based on the carbon price in the carbon trading market of Guangdong Province. The LCA results showed that waste recycling can greatly reduce carbon emissions. The results showed that compared to S1, S2 reduced 6.790 × 10 8 kg CO 2 eq. Additionally, S3 reduced 4.172 × 10 8 kg CO 2 eq. compared to S2. The LCC results show that waste recycling can greatly reduce the total costs of the demolition sector, while the production of recycled powder can generate 57.35% of the revenue from recycled aggregate to the recycling plant. This study combines LCA and LCC, and considers environmental factors to assess the economic results using carbon emissions cost, thereby forging a new exploration method in the field of life cycle theory. The findings of this study could provide a basis for the formulation of a new demolition waste management policy. In the case of the gradual implementation of carbon trading, it could also provide new ideas for current demolition waste treatment from economic and environmental perspectives.","[""abstract""]"

First, the unbundling of vertically integrated utilities resulted in imperfectly competitive electricity markets characterised by oligopolistic ownership structures (Wilson, 2002). Second, concerns about the effect of greenhouse gases (GHGs) on climate change led to carbon pricing through transferable property rights, e.g., allowances or permits. As with any other market, that for carbon allowances can also be subject to the exercise of market power. Kolstad and Wolak (2003)’s empirical study suggests that NOx permits might have been used as a vehicle for producers to exert market power by offering electricity at higher prices in the California market in 2001. Moreover, if a dominant power producer can additionally withhold NOx permits, then it may further increase its profit while driving up the permit price for rivals as demonstrated in a leader-follower case study of the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnection (Chen et al., 2006). We are interested in the economic and environmental effects of market power on electricity and permit markets in regional electricity markets where participants are not all subject to the same CO2reduction policies. An example is the South-East Europe Regional Electricity Market (SEE-REM), which comprises both EU members subject to the emissions cap of the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and non-EU members exempt from such a cap. In a perfectly competitive setting, Višković et al. (2017) demonstrate that between 6% and 40% of the CO2 emission reduction in the ETS portion of SEE-REM may be leaked into the non-ETS portion as nonETS producers with a relatively dirty generation portfolio receive the price signal to increase their exports. In this paper, we examine how a dominant firm, i.e., Enel with ca. 20% of the SEE-REM market share, can (i) gain an economic advantage and (ii) affect carbon leakage by manipulating both the electricity and permit prices.","[""abstract""]"

By simulating the carbon price trends under different economic development and energy consumption levels, this study aims to help the government can plan ahead to formulate various countermeasures to promote the integration of arid and semi-arid regions into the national carbon market.,To achieve this goal, this paper builds a back propagation neural network model, takes the third phase of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) as the research object and uses the mean impact value method to screen out the important driving variables of European Union Allowance (EUA) price, including economic development (Stoxx600, Stoxx50, FTSE, CAC40 and DAX), black energy (coal and Brent), clean energy (gas, PV Crystalox Solar and Nordex) and carbon price alternatives Certification Emission Reduction (CER). Finally, this paper sets up six scenarios by combining the above variables to simulate the impact of different economic development and energy consumption levels on carbon price trends.,Under the control of the unchanged CER price level, economic development, black energy and clean energy development will all have a certain impact on the EUA price trends. When economic development, black energy consumption and clean energy development are on the rise, the EUA price level will increase. When the three types of variables show a downward trend, except for the sluggish development of clean energy, which will cause the EUA price to rise sharply, the EUA price trend will also decline accordingly in the remaining scenarios.,On the one hand, this paper incorporates driving factors of carbon price into the construction of carbon price prediction system, which not only has higher prediction accuracy but also can simulate the long-term price trend.

Most of these assessments find no statistically significant effects of carbon pricing or energy prices on different dimensions of competitiveness, including net imports, foreign direct investments, turnover, value added, employment, profits, productivity, and innovation. When statistically significant results have been found, the magnitude of such effects tends to be small – either positive or negative. Thus, concerns about negative short-term effects of carbon pricing on firms’ or sectors’ international competitiveness have not come to pass, at least to date. These findings are in part because carbon price levels have been low and because of exemptions to carbon taxes for industry, or generous levels of free allowances to firms covered by emissions trading schemes. Key policy insights Most of the studies reviewed in this paper find no statistically significant effects of carbon pricing or energy price fluctuations on different dimensions of competitiveness (employment, profits, net imports). When statistically significant results have been found, the magnitude of such effects is small. This is not surprising, because long term trends in overall energy costs have a small effect compared to other trends. Moreover, carbon costs levied on industry have been low, either because of carbon tax breaks or free allowances to firms. Carbon pricing has a small and positive effect on productivity and innovation. In particular, all studies report statistically significant increases in patenting. Studies that find small negative competitiveness effects tend to focus on net imports and outward foreign direct investment. Establishing a positive and stable carbon price (even if initially at a low level) will provide a clear signal of policy direction for participating firms. This may actually reduce risks to competitiveness in the longer-term if it incentivises firms to adopt advanced pollution abatement technologies in an increasingly carbon-constrained global economy.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

To achieve this target, mitigation efforts in emerging economies through carbon pricing are critical, as they are cost effective and generate revenue. However, carbon pricing policies may not be politically feasible owing to low levels of public support. Therefore, investigation of the factors that affect public support for carbon pricing is crucial. Through a face-to-face survey of a representative sample of the Turkish population, we provide evidence for the drivers of, and barriers to, public support for one form of carbon pricing, that is, a potential carbon taxation. Our results suggest that there are numerous factors influencing support for carbon taxation. Among these, awareness of global warming, the perception of the effectiveness of carbon taxation, and carbon taxation adopted by other countries are the most important factors in terms of their marginal effect on support for the policy. If people have heard about global warming, they are more likely to support carbon taxation. The perception that carbon taxation is an effective policy to address climate change leads to increased public support. Moreover, the presence of carbon taxation in other countries positively influences support. However, an unanticipated result is that the use of carbon taxation revenues for mitigation and adaptation projects is not a statistically significant factor influencing public support. The reason for this may be the perception of the effectiveness of carbon taxation. Key policy insights The perception that carbon taxation is an effective policy for decreasing the use of energy and addressing climate change increases public support for the policy. Concerns about global air pollution and climate change make the public more supportive of carbon taxation. The implementation of carbon taxation by other countries leads to greater public support for such a policy. However, concerns related to competitiveness and the regressive nature of carbon taxation negatively affect support. In contrast with the literature, an interesting finding is that the use of taxation revenues for mitigation and adaptation projects has no statistically significant impact on support.","[""abstract""]"

This conference volume contains edited versions of the six papers presented at the conference, each followed by two written comments by leading scholars and a summary discussion of the debates that followed each paper. The volume also contains a paper, “Climate Change, Climate Policy, and Economic Growth,” by James Stock, based on his dinner talk. The paper provides an extremely useful introduction to the topic of climate change and climate change policy formacroeconomists. The paper makes four key points. First, simple time-series regression models confirm that essentially all the warming over the past 140 years is due to human activity. Second, policy has a crucial role toplay ifwe are to succeed in decarbonizing the economy. Third, current policies will not succeed in decarbonizing the economy in time to prevent severe damage from climate change. Fourth, the politics, as opposed to the economics, of Pigouvian carbon pricing do notwork. This suggests the importance of considering other policies, especially those that drive low-carbon technical innovation. There was no discussant for the paper because of its origin as a dinner talk. We are grateful to James Stock for taking the time to write up his comments on this vitally important topic.","[""abstract""]"

In order to evaluate this hypothesis, we undertake a two-step empirical analysis. First, we estimate how production and net imports change in response to energy prices using a 35-year panel of approximately 450 US manufacturing industries. Second, we use these estimated relationships to simulate the impacts of changes in energy prices resulting from a $15 per ton carbon price. We find that energy-intensive manufacturing industries are more likely to experience decreases in production and increases in net imports than less-intensive industries. Our best estimate is that competitiveness effects—measured by the increase in net imports—are as large as 0.8% for the most energy-intensive industries and represent no more than about one-sixth of the estimated decrease in production.","[""abstract""]"

A global empirical analysis of carbon pricing policies","2020","6","ABSTRACT This article examines why some countries put a price on greenhouse gas emissions while others do not; and why some carbon pricing policies are more ambitious than others. Our study of a global sample of 200 countries by means of event history analysis reveals that governments are more likely to opt for carbon pricing policies when their trading partners, as well as competitor countries that export goods to the same market, also do so. This pattern is similar to what we can observe with regard to the strength of enacted carbon pricing policies. Governments go for more ambitious carbon pricing policies when their closest trade competitors and partners do so as well. In sum, our findings emphasize the strong role of trade-related aspects. Concerns over potential competitive disadvantages thus seem to constitute a major obstacle to policy diffusion and the strengthening of carbon pricing policies. Key policy insights The analysis demonstrates that both the adoption and ambition of carbon pricing policies (CPPs) is strongly driven by trade interdependencies, as well as concerns over competitive disadvantages on the global market: governments opt for more ambitious CPPs when their closest trade partners and competitors do so as well. This highlights the strong role of policy diffusion and pioneer states in the context of climate governance. Demonstrating and highlighting that fears over competitive disadvantages have generally not, so far, come to pass, might help to overcome key obstacles in national discourses on carbon pricing.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

With total emissions nearly a quarter below their 1990 level, the EU has made important progress, but the new goals will require much stronger policy action. Moreover, progress has varied across sectors. Emissions from power and industry have fallen by about a third, buildings by a quarter and agriculture by a fifth – while transport emissions have risen. This paper argues that this divergence reflects differences in effective carbon prices, but also cost differences among the available abatement channels, market imperfections, and policy gaps. It discusses specific sectoral policies needed to address these factors and achieve the new emissions reduction goals.","[""abstract""]"

The proposed approach is based on a combined economic emission (CEE) optimisation model where both energy costs and carbon emissions are taken into account. The CEE optimisation problem is then formulated as a bi-objective optimisation problem, considering a number of practical constraints, such as energy demand, cost budget, emission limit and charging station limit. Carbon price is introduced to convert the bi-objective problem into a single objective function. The authors included EV battery degradation cost to ensure EV owners are not worse off after EVaaS participation. The feasibility of the proposed model is demonstrated in simulation studies.

The aim of this work is to assess which technology, or combination of technologies, is the most cost-effective in achieving climate targets by 2030 leading to a quick and smooth transition to a low carbon energy system in Saudi Arabia and similar oil-based economies. We find that low carbon policy support by banning crude oil in power generation, leads to accelerated underground oil gasification, in the absence of carbon prices. We also find that setting a policy for carbon reduction targets leads to a more flexible energy system transition enabling more technologies in the mix with an increasing transition period. Our results also show that clean hydrocarbon technologies may be sufficient to achieve new climate targets, as shown by the stabilised emissions in scenario 3 by 2025, without the implementation of renewable sources of energy which most studies do not include. We propose that by investing in clean hydrocarbon technologies over the short term, the transition towards a low carbon economy will be accelerated while developing renewable sources of energy over the long term.","[""abstract""]"

In this context, with the purpose of seeking solutions to a carbon financial market pricing mechanism to build China’s carbon finance market actively and thus achieving the goal of sustainable development, this paper, based on the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, established a carbon price prediction model for the carbon financial market, and studied the relationship between Certified Emission Reduction (CER) futures prices and spot prices, as well as the relationship between European Union allowances (EUA) futures prices and CER futures prices in an empirical manner. In this paper, EUA and CER futures prices of the European Climate Exchange (ECX) and EUA and CER spot prices of the BlueNext Environmental Exchange were selected as research objects. Granger causality test, co-integration test, and ECM were used to form a progressive econometric analysis framework. The results show that firstly, the ARIMA model can effectively predict carbon futures prices; secondly, CER futures prices cannot guide spot price, and the futures pricing function does not play a role in this market; thirdly, EUA futures price can, in the short term, effectively guide the trend of CER futures prices, with the futures pricing function between the two markets. In the long run, however, the future pricing function of the two markets is not obvious. Therefore, great differences among maturity of the two markets, degree of policy influence, and market share lead to the failure of long-run futures pricing functions.","[""abstract""]"

Hence, the carbon trading market serves as an indispensable component in forecasting the carbon price accurately in advance. This paper innovatively explores an ensemble‐driven long short‐term memory network (LSTM) model based on complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) for carbon price forecasting, applying it to all eight carbon trading pilots in China. The CEEMD was initially implemented for mode transformation in order to decompose the original complicated mode into a set of simple modes. Then, the partial autocorrelation function selected time‐lagged features as inputs for each mode. Subsequently, the LSTM was used to model the mapping between time‐lagged factors as well as each mode's target values, constructing multiple LSTM models for ensemble learning. Finally, the inverse CEEMD computation was introduced to integrate the anticipated results of the multi‐mode into the final results. Its practical application simultaneously embraced all eight carbon pilots in China, covering their corresponding carbon price data over a considerably long period. The obtained results illustrated that the proposed model driven by ensemble learning possessed sufficient accuracy in carbon price forecasting in China compared with the single LSTM model as well as other conventional artificial neural network models. Furthermore, according to the scope of its application, the innovative model exhibited strong stability and universality.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Evidence from China ETS Pilots","2020","7","Since carbon price volatility is critical to the risk management of the CO 2 emissions trading market, research has focused on energy prices and macroeconomic drivers which cause changes in carbon prices and make the carbon market more volatile than other markets. However, they have ignored whether the impact of carbon price determinants changes when the carbon price is at different levels. To fill this gap, this paper applies a semiparametric quantile regression model to explore the effects of energy prices and macroeconomic drivers on carbon prices at different quantiles. The model combines the advantages of parameter estimation, nonparametric estimation and quantile regression to describe the nonlinear relationship between carbon price and its fundamentals, which do not need to make any assumptions about the random error. Carbon prices are high–tailed and exhibit higher kurtosis, the traditional models which tend to assume that data are normally distributed can’t perform well. Furthermore, the semiparametric model doesn’t need to assume that the data are normally distributed. Therefore, the semiparametric model can effectively model the data. Some new evidence from China’s emission trading scheme (ETS) pilots shows that energy prices and macroeconomic drivers have different effects on carbon prices at high or low quantiles. First, the negative impact of coal prices on carbon prices was greater at the lower quantile of carbon prices in the Shenzhen ETS pilot. However, the effects of coal prices were positive in the Beijing ETS pilot, which may be attributed to great demand for coal. Second, oil prices had greater negative effects on carbon prices at higher quantiles in Beijing and Hubei ETS pilots. This can be attributed to the fact that businesses use less oil when carbon prices are high. For the Shenzhen ETS pilot, the effects of oil prices were positive. Third, natural gas prices have a stronger effect on carbon prices as quantiles increased in the Beijing and Hubei ETS pilots. Lastly, the effects of macroeconomic drivers on carbon prices at low quantiles were stronger in the Shenzhen ETS pilots and higher at the medium quantiles in Beijing and Hubei ETS pilots. These findings suggest that the impact of determinants on the carbon prices at different levels is not constant. Ignoring this issue will lead to a missed warning about the risks of the carbon market. This study will be of positive significance for China’s emission trading scheme (ETS) pilots, in order to accurately monitor the effects of carbon prices determinants and effectively avoid carbon market risks.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This framing of the problem neglects the scope for designing policies that not only mitigate climate change but also yield net benefits for all or most people who are alive today. This chapter considers two avenues by which climate policy can bring substantial immediate gains to the present generation, via (i) air quality co-­‐benefits from reduced use of fossil fuels; and (ii) recycling of rent created by carbon pricing. Both avenues pose important issues of equity within the present generation. 1. Introduction Climate change mitigation policy often is framed as posing a difficult tradeoff between the welfare of the present generation and that of future generations. Policies that aim to curtail climate change – most importantly, by reducing carbon dioxide emissions from use of fossil fuels – are assumed to require sacrifices on the part of those alive today for the sake of those who will follow. Invoking normative criteria of equity, efficiency or both, policy proponents maintain that the future gains from mitigation will outweigh the present pain.

Cities in particular play an important role in the decision-making and implementation processes for the energy transition. However, they often have only limited local energy potential and are heavily dependent on supply regions. We therefore assess how a predominantly renewable power supply can be implemented based on the availability of local or imported renewable resources. We present a case study in which an advanced energy system model is parametrized and applied to address questions which are relevant to the transformation of the energy system in China. The model is capable of simultaneously optimizing investment decisions and hourly power balances of a scenario year, taking into account different storage technologies, regional power exchange and policy constraints such as carbon cap, carbon price and renewable portfolio standards. The study takes the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei metropolitan region with Inner Mongolia as a supply region—considered as exemplary regions characterized by heterogeneous infrastructures, resources and consumption—as its model. Starting from a context-related normative energy scenario, we analyze a possible future electricity system under various assumptions using the Renewable Energy Mix (REMix) energy system model developed at the DLR (German Aerospace Center). Depending on the estimated potentials of renewable energies, technology costs and the projected electricity demand, the metropolitan region is mainly supplied with imported wind and solar power. A sensitivity analysis considers installed capacities, annual generation, CO2 emissions and costs. The results indicate that the assumption of storage costs is of great importance for the future total costs of an electricity system. Variations in other parameters led to different generation portfolios with similar system costs. Our results provide insights into future regional infrastructure needs, and underline the importance of regional coordination and governance for the energy transition in China.","[""abstract""]"

Financing a transition to agroforestry can pose a challenge for many farmers, but carbon offsetting has the potential to support these sustainable practices by providing a financial incentive to sequester carbon using this land management strategy while also creating greater financial diversification and security. Since so many agroforestry practitioners are lowincome smallholders living in the global south, it is worth emphasizing that providing financial support for agroforestry through carbon offsetting can have a significant social impact for impoverished communities. Integrating carbon offsetting into agroforestry systems has a variety of significant obstacles, particularly high transaction costs with limited return, the complexity of making these projects work successfully, and uncertainty around both financial rewards and the legitimacy of the credits. Although there is certainly overlap and nuance, three fundamental categories of barriers are a.) technical and financial, b.) infrastructural, sociological, and political, and c.) social and emotional. Significant carbon market or policy changes would certainly help address many of these issues, but so can the aggregation of smallholder farmers in partnership with trustworthy intermediary organizations that provide technical support and training, measurement and verification tools, support with upfront costs, accountability for additionality and permanence, and connections to broader carbon markets especially when bolstered by complementary programs and grounded in equitable and collaborative community-based projects. These approaches can help make the integration of carbon offsetting into agroforestry systems financially worthwhile, create projects that are successfully implemented, and ensure that they are sustained over time. It is important to bear in mind that, barring exceptional circumstances, carbon offsetting is generally best considered as a supplementary income stream, or an “icing on the cake” for agroforestry projects rather than the sole source of financial support. However, there are some creative approaches to integration and possible changes on the horizon that have the potential to make this integration more fruitful. Agroforestry can be used as a mechanism for preventing deforestation and carbon offsets can be generated based on the carbon loss avoided, generating carbon credits with greater speed and scale than afforestation projects. A similar approach, though entirely theoretical at this point, might involve using agroforestry for wildfire prevention. Technological innovations are ever improving the ease and accuracy of measurement and monitoring, with app-based technologies for those already doing work on the ground being a particularly promising path. Of course, changes in carbon markets, carbon pricing, offset methodologies, policies, and the level of interest and investment in land-based solutions to climate change mitigation also play important roles in what the success and scale of carbon offsetting in agroforestry systems might look like in the future. Although there are certainly obstacles, integrating carbon offsetting into agroforestry systems does hold compelling potential for climate change mitigation, sustainable economic development, and environmental conservation – particularly when creative and collaborative approaches are employed. In partnership with the Duke Carbon Offsets Initiative, this grounded theory research used qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with a diverse set of experts, promoters, and practitioners, supplemented by relevant literature, to explore benefits and barriers, strategies for success, and opportunities on the horizon for integrating carbon offsetting into agroforestry systems.","[""abstract""]"

 <p>Anthropogenic climate change has been attributed mainly to the excessive burning of fossil fuels and the release of carbon compounds. On average, 75% of the primary energy is still being produced by means of fossil fuels. In order to mitigate the global effects of climate change, a transition towards low-carbon economies is thus necessary. However, given current technology, this transition requires investments to shift away from high-carbon assets and so the effectiveness of changes in investment decisions depends highly on the expectations about policy change (e.g. regarding carbon pricing). The systemic implications of disruptive technological progress on the prices of carbon-intensive assets are thus compounded by the geopolitical nature of transition risk. If investors are pricing transition risk, this implies prices of high-carbon assets should all be responsive to climate-related policy news. For modelling the dynamics of volatility co-movements at the global scale, we propose an extension to the global volatility factor model of Engle and Martins (\textit{in preparation}). To allow for richer structures of the global volatility process, including dynamics, structural changes, outliers or time-varying parameters, we adapt the indicator saturation approach introduced by Hendry (1999) to the second moment and high-frequency data. In the model, climate change is interpreted as a source of structural change affecting the financial system. The new global volatility model is applied to the daily share prices of major Oil and Gas companies from different countries traded in the NYSE to avoid asynchronicity. As a proxy for climate change risk, we use the climate change news index of Engle et al. (2019). This index is a time series that captures news about long-run climate risk. In particular, we use the innovations in their negative (or bad) news index which is based on sentiment analysis.</p>

However, perceived asymmetry between the significant up-front costs and relatively abstruse, delayed benefits of climate change mitigation creates particular challenges for the political favorability of policies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a result, carbon pricing mechanisms overwhelmingly endorsed by economists across the ideological spectrum have been, with a few notable exceptions, resoundingly rejected by legislators and political constituencies. Assessment of partisan, policy design, public opinion, and interest group pressures counteracting momentum for carbon pricing is critical in the deployment of a politically durable climate change agenda. This policy-focused communication assesses these dimensions through the examination of three case studies initially discussed by Barry G. Rabe in “Can We Price Carbon?” (MIT Press, 2018)—British Columbia’s carbon tax, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeast United States, and California’s cap-andtrade system for GHGs. Drawing on lessons from case studies and applying political theories to develop Rabe’s analysis, this work synthesizes guiding principles to comment on the feasibility of a U.S. federal carbon tax within the next five years. Lost in Translation: Roadblocks to Carbon Pricing When Political Economy Decouples Throughout the later 20th century, market mechanisms were championed to great effect in solving pressing environmental challenges. The Montreal Protocol enjoyed success in curbing chlorofluorocarbons responsible for ozone depletion at the international level [1]; sulfur dioxide emissions trading drastically curtailed effects of acid rain from industrial pollution in the United States [2]; and durable carbon taxes in fossil fuel-dominated Nordic economies were upheld as globally applicable [3]. Such achievements of market-based policy were especially notable in light of parallel shortcomings of the Kyoto Protocol’s command-andOn the Politics of a U.S. Federal Carbon Price control framework to achieve buy-in for legally binding emissions reduction requirements at the international level [4]. Touting the virtues of economic efficiency and potential to decouple emissions and economic growth through the market, American policymakers had warmed to the idea of carbon pricing by the early 2000s, leading to bi-partisan sentiment that a carbon price could form a pillar of U.S. national climate policy [5]. The failure of subsequent legislation delivered a shock to the American political system. Indeed, recent congressional efforts to promote a national carbon tax have stalled, with the last major effort culminating in the failed Waxman-Markey bill of the early Obama presidency, which was subject to “pork barrel” politics in the House of Representatives and was never brought to the Senate floor for debate [6]. No serious effort to rekindle momentum toward carbon pricing is expected until after the conclusion of the Trump presidency, and even then, prospects remain highly uncertain. Perhaps these failures are attributable to consumers’ acute awareness to increased prices of high-carbon goods, or the distributional implications of environmental taxes, as seen in France’s gilets jaunes protests. Perhaps a lack of trust in scientific institutions, heightened partisan polarization, formidable opposition from the fossil fuel lobby, and a poisoned public discourse on environmental issues are to blame. Perhaps carbon pricing is simply a low-priority item on an already-packed national agenda, and decisionmakers have instead embraced largely tokenistic alternatives such as relatively unambitious renewable portfolio standards and emissions reduction goals, hoping to appease environmentally-inclined constituents. The examination of carbon taxation in British Columbia, Canada, and American emissions trading systems in New England and California reveals the simultaneous operation of these political barriers, and the need for contextspecific and creative policy techniques to overcome them. Ultimately, a U.S. federal carbon tax is found unlikely to emerge amid a diverse coalition of oppositional forces in the near term, though the potential to adopt principles from successful policy formulation and implementation provide reason for cautious optimism over longer time horizons.

The Paris agreement of 2015 is the central international agreement to deal with this challenge. Against this background, a multi-model study in the context of the Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) is conducted with the objective of providing a thorough economic impacts assessment for the implementation of national greenhouse gas emission reduction targets that countries submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in the context of the Paris agreement as their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The analysis is based on a systematic cross-comparison of around 15 internationally established energy-economy models. Carbon pricing is commonly regarded as a central policy instrument to meet the Paris targets at relatively low costs and is at the core of the analyzed scenarios. 
 
The analysis focuses on two key aspects of future climate policies: First, the global and regional economic cost of implementing NDCs, as well as implications of different degrees of international cooperation and coalition building; Second, the incidence of carbon pricing on the household level for different carbon prices and different policy designs.

The economy-wide emissions targets focus on the mid-term (2030) and mid-century (2050) goals thus provide flexibility in clean energy technology development pathways. The extent of the flexibility, however, is constrained by the complementary measures proposed to develop low-carbon solutions in certain sectors. Therefore, it is critical to evaluate different mitigation strategies to improve the understanding of challenges and opportunities for California. To capture the technology details while examining the economy-wide policy impact, we employ an integrated top-down bottom-up modeling framework (USREP-EleMod) that combines a recursive dynamic multi-sector computable general equilibrium model with an hourly dispatch and capacity expansion electricity model. Ongoing results show a substantial carbon price increase over the years as a consequence of the stringent economy-wide GHG emissions reductions of 40% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. By 2030, the expected price is close to $220 per tCO2 and rises above $400 per tCO2 by the end of the time horizon. Because of this, renewable natural gas (RNG) starts to become competitive against natural gas (NG), and gradually grows to meet carbon-free fuel demand from different sectors in particular the industrial sector. By 2050, total NG consumption falls by 2.8 Quads whereas total RNG increases by 1 Quad. In the electricity sector, we observe that the generation mix heavily relies on solar and wind resources to meet the carbon-free target by 2045. However, we also note that the electricity sector increases the use of RNG and CCS technologies as a substitute for conventional NG Combined Cycles and Combustion Turbines.","[""abstract""]"

Our results show that by 2050, CO2 emissions in developing countries will be 1.4–4.7-fold greater than the levels in 2005, while most air pollutant emissions will show large reductions (mean annual reduction rates of 0.2% to 6.1%). Notably, implementation of transport, emission control, and carbon pricing policies would reduce CO2 emissions by up to 33% and other air pollutants by 43% to 72%, depending on the emission species. An emission control policy represents the strongest approach for short-term and mid-term reduction of air pollutants. A carbon pricing policy would lead to a direct reduction in CO2 emissions; more importantly, air pollutant emissions would also be effectively reduced. Shifting to public transportation in developing countries can also greatly influence emissions reductions. An increase in traffic speed shows relatively small effects, but can be meaningful in Japan.","[""abstract""]"

This striking result follows from the dominance of the sources over uses side impacts of the policy and stands in sharp contrast to previous work that has focused only on the uses side.

Between 1990 and 2017, New Zealand’s gross greenhouse gas emissions increased by 23.1% while emissions from the road transport sector increased by 82%; rising to 15.9 MtCO2e in 2017 from about 8.8 MtCO2e in 1990. To reduce transport emissions, the government has undertaken various initiatives including electric vehicle support, introduction of an emissions trading scheme (ETS), promotion of biofuel and other alternative fuels, and announcement of a feebate scheme. However, even though some of these policies require time to take effect, it is evident from the increase in emissions that there has so far been little progress in terms of transport emissions reduction. This raises questions over the acceptability and effectiveness of the policies taken by the government.  Given the pressing need to reduce transport emissions globally and in New Zealand in particular, the present study initially investigates the major drivers of transport emissions from among a set of likely drivers, using a causality test. Because electric vehicles are widely seen as an obvious ‘solution’ within the sector, this study next examines the costs and mitigation potential of electric vehicles in the New Zealand context in order to understand the uncertainties, risks, barriers, costs, and policy gaps associated with their widespread adoption. Next, this study examines the scope for an increased carbon price signal to curb emissions growth. Finally, this study takes the view that technological and price instruments have to be seen within a wider range of possible transport policy measures, some of which may be complementary. The study therefore elicited the perspectives of a number of transport experts, and NGO and green energy activists. It ranked six mitigation policy pathways and 26 policy options on the basis of experts’, and NGO and green energy activists’ preferences.   Findings of this study include that poor vehicle fuel economy is the major driver of transport emissions in New Zealand. Policies such as a high minimum vehicle fuel economy standard and/or feebate scheme could effectively help New Zealand reduce its transport emissions significantly. Electric vehicles (EVs) are also found to be potentially very effective in reducing emissions as around 80-85% of New Zealand’s electricity comes from renewable generation. Moreover, in terms of the ownership costs of using EVs, used EVs are now the most cost competitive among various vehicle types such as new EVs, used internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and new ICEVs. An increase in the carbon price to around NZD 235 per tonne of carbon dioxide (tCO2) is also likely to help the transport sector reduce its emissions by 11% from the 1990 level and achieve the Paris target. However, according to experts’, and NGO and green energy activists’ preferences, EV support and an increased carbon price are not the most preferred emissions reduction options. Some experts, and NGO and green energy activists viewed EV subsidization, EV free parking and EV access to high occupancy lanes as unethical because EVs are mostly used by high-income people whereas low-income people often use bus or low-cost used cars. Likewise, some experts, and NGO and green energy activists did not prefer an increased carbon price because the impact of such a policy would be uneven, and low-income people would be hurt severely compared to high-income people. Results demonstrate that active and public transport support and travel demand management are the most preferred options. Since New Zealand roads are not wide enough to support a high level of individual car use both in the short and the long run, most experts, and NGO and green energy activists preferred active and public transport under current and future circumstances. Policies related to bio-fuel support were least preferred because most experts, and NGO and green energy activists think an increased production and use of biofuels is likely to replace existing forestry and farm activity and decrease food production and forestry. It is hoped that the findings of this study will help to better illuminate the difficult policy options facing policy makers and work to assist them in identifying the most acceptable policies and projects for investment.","[""abstract""]"

The above challenges are significant for the Group of Twenty (G20). Thus, we propose the implementation of country-specific carbon pricing policies while accounting for any negative effects of such policies on the competitiveness of G20 economies.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

 This is according to BP’s newly published Energy Outlook 2020 which outlines different scenarios that the company has developed to imagine how the global energy transition will unfold.
 In two of these scenarios, a “rapid” transition case and a more aggressive “net-zero” case, the changing winds of the energy landscape coupled with the economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic will mean that global crude demand never again surpasses 2019’s average of around 100 million B/D. Along these lines, the models suggest that 2019 could also mark the peak of carbon emissions from energy use.
 To varying degrees both the rapid and net-zero scenarios assume that tighter government policies around emissions and increases in carbon pricing will accelerate the current growth trajectory of renewable installations. The biggest difference between the two is that the net-zero scenario expects energy consumers themselves will move the needle even more by changing their behaviors and energy-consumption preferences.
 By 2050, these factors could lead global demand to be as low as 55 million B/D to 30 million B/D.
 BP’s “business-as-usual” case holds as its underlying assumption that government policy, technology uptake/development, and consumer preferences will continue to evolve toward renewables at generally the same pace as we have seen in recent years.
 Regardless, all three scenarios see the consumption of coal, oil, and natural gas dropping while the role of renewable energy is set to soar. The outlook highlights that fossil fuels accounted for 85% of primary energy demand in 2018 but that by 2050 they may represent only 65 to 20% of the share.
 “This would be entirely unprecedented. In the modern history of energy, there has never been a sustained decline in the consumption of any traded fuel,” said Spencer Dale, the chief economist at BP.
 As fossil fuels face diminishing demand, renewable sources of energy could all increase their share of the energy mix from 2018’s figure of 5% to between 20 and 60% by the end of the outlook’s 30-year time frame. Wind and solar are expected to represent the lion’s share of this growth. If that happens, Dale added that renewables would “penetrate the energy system more quickly than any fuel in modern history.”
 BP’s outlook comes a month after the company announced during an earnings call with investors that it was attempting to shed its reputation as an international oil company and construct a new one as an integrated energy company that will spend $5 billion annually on low-carbon technologies while also setting a target to reduce its overall oil and gas production by 40% by 2030.","[""abstract""]"

To achieve the ambitious climate goals of the Paris Agreement, forest protection is essential. Yet deforestation continues to diminish the world's forests. Halting this trend is the objective of the international framework for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). While previous studies have demonstrated the contribution of tropical forests to mitigate climate change, here we show that tropical forest protection can ‘flatten the curve’ of the costs of transition to climate stability, estimating tens of trillions of dollars in policy cost savings. Technical summary The pledges made by parties under the Paris Agreement are insufficient to limit global warming to well below 2 °C relative to pre-industrial levels. We use a global climate-economic model to quantify the economic benefits from rapidly deploying programs for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and increased reforestation (REDD+) given current delays in the implementation of climate policies around the world. REDD+ has been shown to have substantial greenhouse gas emissions mitigation potential in the fight against climate change and can thus play a critical role in closing the emissions gap, thereby enabling the achievement of more ambitious climate targets. Under our principal scenario, we estimate that REDD+ can contribute up to US$36 trillion in net policy cost savings by mitigating the adjustment costs of reaching a greenhouse gas emissions trajectory consistent with ambitious global climate stabilization goals. Investment in REDD+ has a high benefit-cost ratio; one dollar invested in REDD+ yields about US$5.4 in net policy cost savings. Realizing the full estimated potential for REDD+ reduces the risk-adjusted carbon price in 2030 by US$45/tCO2.

One of the effective approaches to mitigate carbon emissions is the implementation of closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). The key motivation for considering multiple recovery options in the CLSC is to capture the remaining economic value and to reduce carbon emissions in the collection and recovery operations. Customer’s willingness to return used product depends on the acquisition price and nearness to the collection center. This research proposes a deterministic mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for a multi-period and multi-product CLSC network under carbon pricing and carbon trading policies consideration. The model includes different acquisition price for returned products and multiple recovery options. Further, the study takes into consideration uncertainty in procurement cost, demand, and quantity of returned products. A robust optimization approach is adopted to address uncertainty in network parameters. Numerical results show that the proposed model captures trade-offs between total cost and carbon emission. Overall, the study reveals that the carbon trading policy incurs relatively lower total cost compared to the carbon pricing policy. Repair and recycling activities in the reverse supply chain contribute significantly to the total cost and carbon emission. This study provide evidence that it is possible to achieve an optimal CLSC network with reduced carbon emission at a moderate total supply chain cost. The proposed model could be used to guide firms to choose an appropriate budget of uncertainty toward achieving a robust supply chain network.","[""abstract""]"

Adding a second turbine to use the stored syngas to generate electricity at peak hours and implementing 12 h of above-ground high-pressure syngas storage significantly increases the ROI and net present value.

Many distributional analyses of carbon pricing focus on the uses-side incidence of carbon pricing. This is the differential burden resulting from heterogeneity in consumption across households. Once one allows for sources-side incidence (i.e. differential impacts of changes in real factor prices), carbon policies look more progressive.

The path toward achieving those deep decarbonization targets can take various shapes but will surely include a portfolio of economy-wide low-carbon energy technologies/options. The growth of the intermittent renewable power sources in the grid mix has helped reduce the carbon footprint of the electric power sector. Under the need for decarbonizing the electric power sector, we simulated a low-carbon power system. We investigated the role of hydrogen for future electric power systems under current cost projections. The model optimizes the power generation mix economically for a given carbon constraint. The generation mix consists of intermittent renewable power sources (solar and wind) and dispatchable gas turbine and combined cycle units fueled by natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration, as well as hydrogen. We created several scenarios with battery storage options, pumped hydro, hydrogen storage, and demand-side response (DSR). The results show that energy storage replaces power generation, and pumped hydro entirely replaces battery storage under given conditions. The availability of pumped hydro storage and demand-side response reduced the total cost as well as the combination of solar photovoltaic and pumped hydro storage. Demand-side response reduces relatively costly dispatchable power generation, reduces annual power generation, halves the shadow carbon price, and is a viable alternative to energy storage. The carbon constrain defines the generation mix and initializes the integration of hydrogen (H2). Although the model rates power to gas with hydrogen as not economically viable in this power system under the given conditions and assumptions, hydrogen is important for hard-to-abate sectors and enables sector coupling in a real energy system. This study discusses the potential for hydrogen beyond this model approach and shows the differences between cost optimization models and real-world feasibility.","[""abstract""]"

In following its commitments to the Paris Agreement and in pursuit of near-zero emissions from power plants, China has actively moved towards high efficiency, low emission (HELE) coal-fired power plants. However, HELE technology alone cannot completely cut carbon emissions, and will require a mature CO2 emissions reduction technology such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) to significantly reduce the CO2 emissions within short to medium term.

However, current and projected carbon prices present a considerable barrier to broad‐scale adoption of tree planting as a key mitigation strategy. One avenue to provide additional economic and environmental incentives to encourage wider adoption of revegetation is the bundling or stacking of additional co‐beneficial ecosystem services that can be realized from tree planting. Using the World's largest land‐based carbon credit trading scheme, the Australian Emissions Reduction Scheme (ERF), we examine the potential for three pairs of ecosystem services, where the carbon sequestration value of land use change is paired with an additional co‐benefit with strong prospects for local tangible benefits to land owners/providers. Two cases consider agricultural provisioning values that can be realized by the landowners in higher returns: increased pollination services and reduced lamb mortality. The third case examined payments for tree plantings along riparian buffers, with payments to farmers by a water utility who realizes the benefit from reduced treatment cost due to water quality improvements. Economic incentives from these co‐benefit case studies were found to be mixed, with avoided treatment costs from water quality paired with carbon payments the most promising, while pollination and reduced lamb mortality paired with carbon payments were unable to bridge the economic gap except under the most optimistic assumptions. We conclude that the economics case for significant land use change are likely to be geographically dispersed and only viable in relatively niche landscape positions in high establishment, high opportunity cost areas even when carbon payments are augmented with the value of co‐benefits classified as providing direct and local benefits.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

At this stage, the burden of proof lies with the EU, and it must provide reassurance that its initiative will benefit its trading partners, who are also moving towards neutrality. On such a complex issue, it must scrupulously assess the expected and unintended impacts of the proposed approach and ensure that domestic and international pledges converge on the same expectations. It is therefore a priority to engage in a more open dialogue with non-EU partners, focusing on four themes: — Understanding and responding to the vulnerability of Europe’s trading partners, distinguishing between the real vulnerability of some Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in particular, and the political risk of an argument being used as a rallying cry. — Scope of the adjustment mechanism: in relation to the previous point, short and medium-term objectives must be clarified, bearing in mind that the EU’s internal promises, if poorly managed, can undermine diplomatic efforts. — Potential attractiveness of an adjustment mechanism for partners that develop domestic carbon pricing: here the priority should be given to bilateral trade in the first instance, particularly with the United States and China; and at the same time the EU could be clearer in its advocacy of such an approach in international fora. — The broader perspective from which countries or regions perceive the proposed adjustment mechanism.

Choice of mode and complementary policies are critical to shaping the costs of climate mitigation in the transport sector. This paper investigates the potentials offered by combined technological and behavioural changes stimulated by strategic infrastructure deployment that can facilitate decarbonization of transport in China. Our study is carried out using IMACLIM-R, a state-of-the-art integrated assessment model, which includes a detailed representation of transport dynamics by incorporating the behavioural determinants of mobility in a standard transport modelling framework. More specifically, this behavioural representation considers (i) the spatial organization of residential dwellings and industrial production, (ii) modal shift induced by transport infrastructure deployment and (iii) the intensity of freight transport production and distribution processes. It is found that supplementing carbon pricing with behavioural measures and a decoupling of economic activity from mobility needs can efficiently promote a modal shift towards low-carbon transport modes and reallocate the sectoral distribution of mitigation efforts. This in turn would significantly reduce the macro-economic impacts of deeply decarbonizing Chinese transport activities over the next decades. Complementary policies should focus on infrastructure, fiscal incentives, land-use, building regulations and other policies affecting the ways urban activities are distributed within the city’s boundary, along with industrial policies and other regulations that affect where firms choose to locate. Key policy insights To decarbonize China’s transport sector an integrated approach is needed due to strong inertia and distributional effects. Complementary policies have to focus on transport infrastructure, fiscal incentives, land-use and building regulations, as well as spatial organization. Transport-related climate policies interconnect with the ways in which urban activities are distributed within the city’s boundary, but also with industrial policies and other regulations that affect where firms choose to locate.

Whilst efficient market designs for electricity have tended to focus upon market power concerns, environmental externalities pose extra challenges for efficient solutions. Thus, we show that ad hoc remedies for market power alongside administered carbon prices are inefficient unless they are integrated. Accordingly, we develop an incentive-based market clearing design that can include externalities as well as market power mitigation. A feature of the solution is that it copes with incomplete information of the system operator regarding generation costs. It is uses a network representation of the power system and the proposed incentive mechanism holds even with energy limited technologies having temporal constraints, e.g., storage. The shortcomings of price caps to mitigate market power, in the context of sustainability externalities, are overcome under the proposed incentive mechanism.","[""abstract""]"

Various damage functions reflect the loss in final production and capital due to the rise in temperature. A calibration of our model at the world scale enables us to simulate various planetary scenarios. Our findings are threefold: 1) the +2°C target is already out of reach, absent negative emissions; 2) the long-run dynamic consequences of climate change on economic fundamentals may lead to a severe downside. Under plausible circumstances, global warming forces the private sector to leverage in order to compensate for output and capital losses; the private debt overhang may eventually induce a global financial breakdown, even before climate change could cause serious damage to the production sector. 3) Implementing an adequate carbon price trajectory, as well as increasing the wage share, fostering employment, and reducing private debt make it easier to avoid unintended degrowth and to reach a +2.5°C C target.","[""abstract""]"

Evidence from specific projects has been confronted by realities on the ground, with positive or negative consequences for effectiveness that were difficult to predict in the abstract. Independent / Self-reported The best evidence is generated by disinterested observers who have as few relevant explicit or implicit biases as possible. Generating evidence in this way implies additional costs, of course, so much of the available evidence has generally been generated within the organisations implementing or funding the project concerned. Retrospective / Prospective Implementing projects is messy, and things happen that are not expected. In addition, there are often incentives to inflate the expected value of a project and to deflate the expected costs, meaning reality can sometimes be disappointing. For these reasons, we consider retrospective evaluations to be more useful when asking which approaches are most cost-effective when implemented. The extent of theoretical assumptions required to construct the counterfactual In order to establish a causal connection between changes predicted or observed and the intervention designed to bring them about, we must ask not just what change is predicted or observed, but also what would happen/ would have happened otherwise – we must identify the counterfactual. For prospective studies, we must model both possible futures, and both models will be underpinned by similarly demanding theoretical assumptions. However, for retrospective studies, we do not have to rely on so much theory to observe what happened to people and institutions affected by the intervention. This is the great advantage of retrospective evaluation that the previous bullet point referred to – observation can surprise us with things our theory cannot predict. Things get trickier when we move from observing what happened to trying to observe the counterfactual. This is because we can never observe what would have happened in the absence of an intervention that was in fact implemented. However, there are many approaches that allow us to construct a counterfactual. Famously, randomised controlled trials minimise the theoretical assumptions required to observe the counterfactual because, in expectation, the control group is not dissimilar from the treated group in any causally relevant way. So-called ‘natural experiments’ introduce some more theoretical assumptions in order to identify a counterfactual even when a randomised controlled trial has not been conducted. However, these rely on there being some characteristic of project implementation that can be exploited to identify untreated observations who can be modelled as relevantly similar to treated observations. Where neither natural nor unnatural experiments are possible, we must conduct an ‘observational’ study and use much more theory about the way causation of the outcome works to try to identify untreated observations that can serve as a comparison to our treated observations. The more theory is required in order to generate a counterfactual, the closer a retrospective evaluation becomes to a modelling exercise. Some of the advantages of retrospective evaluation are therefore lost the more theory is necessary in generating the counterfactual.7 Macro-level interventions Many macro-level emissions mitigation interventions appear to offer the most cost-effective ways of reducing emissions in developing countries (as elsewhere). However, the costeffectiveness of donor actions to encourage the adoption of these policies is extremely hard to estimate for two reasons: it is difficult to estimate the costs and effectiveness of macrolevel interventions for each new territory; and cost-effectiveness of donor actions differs from moment to moment and from donor to donor on the basis of political considerations. 7 This is not to suggest that randomised controlled trials are categorically ‘better’ than observational retrospective studies. Observational studies may be possible in more varied locations, give access to greater sample sizes and otherwise compensate for their higher dependence on theory. See Deacon and Cartwright (2018) and the rest of that special issue for a very detailed discussion. Therefore, the majority of this paper focusses on micro-level interventions, though we briefly consider macro-level interventions in this section. Fossil fuel subsidy reform and carbon pricing Fossil fuel subsidy reform is one policy change with large climate benefits and negative costs (financial benefits) for the enacting authority. This is the case for some lowand middleincome countries as it is for some high-income ones. China and India continue to subsidise fossil fuels by large dollar amounts, though these subsidies are small as a percentage of GDP. Algeria, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and to a lesser extent Azerbaijan and Ecuador subsidise fossil fuels to amounts that are still significant but smaller in absolute terms and which are very much larger in terms of GDP. Figure 1 summarises the absolute and relative values of subsidies for the top 25 fossil fuel subsidising countries in 2019. Figure 1. Value of fossil-fuel subsidies by fuel in the top 25 countries, 2019 (Gould et al., 2020) The prima-facie case for the cost-effectiveness of reducing or removing fossil fuel subsidies as a measure to reduce emissions is reinforced by modelling, most notably from the IMF (Coady et al., 2019).8 From the point of view of the state, removing subsidies frees large amounts of resources for other use. The political economy of subsidies and equity 8 It is challenging to construct a compelling counterfactual to evaluate the effectiveness of macro-level interventions retrospectively. The sorts of retrospective evidence that can be generated, such as case study analysis or the use of the synthetic control method, will be highly dependent on a theory of how the intervention was supposed to work and their findings will be sensitive to flaws in that theory. Likewise, attempts to transfer ex-post cost-effectiveness lessons from one macro-level context to another will be highly dependent on modelling assumptions about the characteristics of the context that are relevant to the action of the intervention and the extent to which these characteristics are relevantly similar between studied context and target context. For these reasons, the distinction between retrospective, observed cost-effectiveness evidence and modelling evidence of what is likely to work breaks down more readily than for interventions at the micro level or meso levels. Therefore, we are more accepting of modelling evidence supported by case studies as the best available in this section than is necessary for micro-level interventions. considerations may mean that it is necessary to allocate most or all of those resources to transfers to groups who have suffered due to the removal of subsidies (Lockwood, 2015). This reallocation will incur administrative costs. Nevertheless, in this situation the financial cost to the state of removing subsidies remains negative, or positive but very close to zero. This represents an extremely cost-effective climate emissions mitigation option for countries that have not yet undertaken reforms. The consistent barrier to such reforms has been the political difficulty of enacting them. This is lessened in many countries in the wake of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The fall in aggregate demand resulting from the pandemic has driven down fossil fuel consumption, providing what Gould et al. at the International Energy Agency (2020) call ‘a historic opportunity to phase out fossil fuel consumption subsidies.’ For this reason, modelling evidence alone is enough to suggest that fossil fuel subsidy reform is the most cost-effective mitigation action that many countries could take.9 This does not mean that donor action to promote fossil fuel subsidy reform will be cost-effective. History is littered with ‘historic opportunities’ that have not been taken, and specifically with failed fossil fuel subsidy reforms (IMF, 2013). Introducing carbon pricing is an even more powerful policy with high mitigation potential and negative costs for the state. It is widely agreed, on the basis of modelling evidence, that carbon pricing is a necessary (but not sufficient) part of the policy mix to achieve the emissions reductions required to limit global temperature rises below 2°C (Mehling & Tvinnereim, 2018; Stern & Stern, 2007; Stiglitz et al., 2017). Similarly, modelling suggests that other policies will be more effective in the presence of a sufficient carbon price (Edmonds et al., 2019). As with eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, there is widespread theoretical agreement of the desirability of pricing carbon, but many countries face severe technical and political challenges to implementation. Many other macro-level interventions which appear to be cost-effective are available such as regulation to subsidise mitigation technologies or to disincentivise high-emissions activity such as natural gas flaring. As for carbon pricing and eliminating fossil fuel subsidies, the question for donors is: are there cost-effective donor actions that can increase developing country take-up of these policies? Are donor actions to encourage macro-level interventions cost-effective? Development agencies cannot directly implement national policy in recipient countries; that is the purview of the sovereign governments of recipient countries. Therefore, the costeffectiveness of such policies is only relevant to development agencies in donor countries insofar as it provides and argument for the cost-effectiveness of actions the agency can take. In most cases, the relevant actions will be advocacy, convening and technical assistance activities designed to overcome political or capacity barriers to implementation.

With increasing momentum to develop green economies, and projected increases in carbon price, growth in the global carbon market is inevitable. The establishment of a soil-based carbon economy, within this emerging financial space, has the potential to deliver a paradigm shift that will accelerate climate change mitigation, and concurrently realize net gains for soil health and the delivery of soil ecosystem services.

To capture the behavioral responses of heterogeneous households to regulation and consistently value the monetary and time costs of commuting, we integrate (1) spatial household-level data on the location of residence and work, (2) road network and tra c data from Google, and (3) household survey data on expenditure and income into a dynamic general equilibrium model which features pre-existing fuel taxes and technology choice between internal combustion engine and electric vehicles. Ignoring co-bene ts, an emissions intensity standard outperforms carbon pricing because it is a smaller implicit tax on factors of production. With co-bene ts, carbon pricing yields aggregate e ciency gains. Moreover, only high-income households with shortto medium-distance commutes or low congestion exposure prefer a standard over carbon pricing. Under both policies, low-income households with long commutes incur the largest costs. Our analysis suggests that carbon pricing, along with targeted measures to alleviate the burden for low-income households, can be an e cient and equitable instrument for decarbonizing private transport. ∗Department of Management, Technology, and Economics and Centre for Energy Policy and Economics (CEPE) at ETH Zurich, Switzerland.

This portion of the Act concerns trans-boundary air pollution, and under its provisions a national greenhouse target could be allocated among the states, with the details of state implementation optionally guided by a model rule as under other provisions of the Act. With trading allowed among the states, such a measure could lead to a national price on the covered gases. While we adopt features of a possible Section 115 implementation, the illustrative analysis is applicable to similar cap-and-trade programs that might be adopted under other authorities. We investigate the implications of such a policy using MIT’s U.S. Regional Energy Policy (USREP) model, with its electric sector replaced by the Renewable Energy Development System (ReEDS) model developed by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Existing federal and state climate policies are assumed to remain in place, and a national constraint on CO2 emissions is applied to achieve 45% or 50% reductions below the 2005 level by 2030. We apply the policies in a Baseline and a Low-Cost Baseline, the latter with more aggressive assumptions of technology cost improvements. The U.S. is aggregated to 18 individual states and 12 multi-state regions, and the effects of the national emissions restriction are investigated under three alternative methods by which the EPA might allocate these targets among the states. We find the cost of achieving either target to be modest allowing for nearly identical economic growth, even without taking account of air quality and climate benefits. The alternative allocation methods generate varying per capita revenue outcomes among states and regions and drive most of the welfare impact through a direct income effect. It is assumed that states distribute permit revenue to their residents in equal lump-sum payments, which leads to net benefits to lower income households. Under the Low-Cost Baseline, carbon prices in 2030 are about 1⁄3 those in the Baseline, and the overall pre-benefit welfare effects are negligible. Considering climate benefits evaluated using the social cost of carbon and particulate matter air pollution health benefits, less the mitigation costs, we find net benefits in all cases, with slightly larger net benefits with the 50% reduction below 2005 emissions. 1 Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change, MIT, Cambridge MA 02139 2 Environmental Science and Policy, Smith College, Northampton MA 01063 1.

A Potential U.S. National GHG Emissions Policy 1.1 Action Under the Clean Air Act To make its contribution to the Paris Agreement goal of keeping global warming “well below” 2°C, the U.S. will need to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions sharply over the next few decades. Though states, cities and many in the private sector are taking action on their emissions, federal leadership is needed, preferably pursuant to new comprehensive climate legislation. However, since 2009 when a comprehensive climate bill cleared the House but failed in the Senate, the U.S. Congress has not seriously considered legislation that could achieve the needed emissions reductions. Even with growing public support for national action on climate, congressional passage of comprehensive climate legislation also seems unlikely in the near future. Fortunately, an alternative response is available to meet the climate challenge: executive action, including under the Clean Air Act (CAA). Previously, the Obama Administration launched a Climate Action Plan whose centerpiece was action under the CAA. It applied CAA Section 202(a), which grants the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) the authority to regulate emissions from new motor vehicles, and Section 111, which does the same for new and existing stationary sources (used to set standards for power plants, landfills, and oil and gas operations). Though the resulting regulations were subsequently weakened by the Trump Administration, these CAA provisions are important tools for emissions control. Yet they are also imperfect mechanisms for achieving ambitious, comprehensive GHG emissions control. This sectoral approach makes key sources of emissions, such as vehicles already on the road, difficult to address. Also, the constraints within each section of the statute (e.g., the directive to use the “Best System of Emissions Reduction” under Section 111) could limit the potential reductions. Further, the sector-by-sector approach not only reduces the speed of reductions, by requiring multiple time-consuming rulemakings, but can also miss potential economic efficiencies by limiting the ability to seek the lowest-cost emission reductions regardless of source or location, and it opens up potential leakage to underor uncontrolled sectors. One possible outcome of this sector-by-sector approach under existing authority is a gap between what the sector-by-sector approach can achieve and the emissions reductions needed to put the U.S. on track to meeting the Administration’s long-term emissions goals or even potential new emissions pledges under the Paris Agreement. For example, one prediction of baseline emissions in 2030 is that total U.S. GHG emissions might be 27% below 2005 levels. (Larsen et al., 2020). Conventional regulatory policies could further reduce emissions. But because of constraints on these measures, the failure to address all emission sources, and the possibility of leakage and rebound effects, reductions could fall short of the desired level.1 Seeking an approach to close any potential 2030 emissions gap, we explore another policy tool provided in the CAA: Section 115 which concerns international air pollution. This provision of the Act offers a possible opportunity to fill the gaps among state and federal policies, avoiding limitations of actions under Sections 202(a) and 111, and to do so in an efficient, flexible, and equitable fashion. Potential designs for such a policy are investigated using a simulation model of the U.S. economy, with particular attention to the distribution of economic impacts among the states, and among income groups within states. 1.2 Features of CAA Section 115 Section 115 (42 U.S. Code § 7415) on “International Air Pollution” has been part of the Clean Air Act since 1965. It is triggered when: a) EPA “. . . has reason to believe that any air pollutant or pollutants emitted in the United States cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare in a foreign country” (endangerment), and b) that the other country “has given the U.S. essentially the same rights with respect to the prevention or control of air pollution occurring in that country as is given that country” (reciprocity). This provision of the CAA is potentially well suited for application to climate policy considering the danger of climate change to the U.S., the transboundary nature of greenhouse gases, and the reciprocity provided by the Paris Agreement, wherein all emitters have pledged emissions reductions. When the two conditions above are met, EPA must require each U.S. state to develop an implementation plan through the same process used for implementing the National Ambient Air Quality ","[""abstract""]"

Such interactions take the form of negative, zero or positive synergistic effects. The considered instruments comprise performance and technical standards, carbon pricing, adoption subsidies, innovation support, and information provision. Based on the findings, we formulate climate-policy packages that avoid negative and employ positive synergies, and compare their strengths and weaknesses on other criteria. We note that the international context of climate policy has been neglected in assessments of policy mixes, and argue that transparency and harmonization of national policies may be key to a politically feasible path to meet global emission targets. This suggests limiting the complexity of climate-policy packages. Key policy insights Combining technical standards or targets, such as renewable-energy quota, or adoption subsidies with a carbon market can produce negative synergy, up to the point of adding no emissions reduction beyond the cap. For maximum emissions reduction, renewable energy policy should be combined with carbon taxation and target expensive reduction options not triggered by the tax. Evidence regarding synergy of information provision with pricing is mixed, indicating a tendency for complementary roles (zero synergy). Positive synergy is documented only for cases where information provision improves effectiveness of price instruments, e.g. by stimulating social imitation of low-carbon choices. We conclude that the most promising packages are combining innovation support and information provision with either a carbon tax and adoption subsidy, or with a carbon market. We further argue that the latter could have stronger potential to harmonize international policy, which would allow to strengthen mitigation policy over time.","[""abstract""]"

First, it situates the strategy in relation to the global warming potential of new extracted/exported emissions facilitated by new pipelines, which would overwhelm the savings created by the carbon price. Second, the paper focuses on the policy's potential to exacerbate a perilous national accumulation strategy that leaves workers and communities highly vulnerable to unstable global commodity markets.

At the national level, the distributional impact prior to revenue recycling is largely neutral, sometimes progressive. At an aggregate EU level, however, the impact is regressive because some low-income countries would be highly impacted if subjected to a common EU carbon price. While national redistribution can do much to make EU incidence progressive, we show that European-wide redistribution is more effective for especially affected households. We offer two indicators to offset regressive distributional effects of EU climate policy such as the recently proposed Green Deal. The first renders the tax burden proportional; the second focuses on compensating the households most seriously affected. Including both indicators in European redistribution makes for a better representation of the initial burden of carbon pricing and could make the policy more salient for citizens.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This paper explores the role of such financial resources in achieving strict welfare gains (Pareto improvements) when emission targets deviate from the global welfare optimum, and there are impediments to international trade. Using a general equilibrium model of international trade with global emission externalities, it is shown that strict Pareto improvements in welfare may arise from multilateral financial transfers when either trade or carbon taxes are constrained away from their Pareto optimal levels. The purpose of financial transfers is then to account for the impact on emissions of trade distortions and inappropriate carbon pricing. Importantly, such transfers exist if and only if a generalized normality condition is violated. Numerical examples illustrate the financial transfer mechanism.","[""abstract""]"

Currently, the aviation sector is considered one of the fastest-growing greenhouse gas emissions sources. Attempting to reduce these emissions in a cost-effective manner, the EU decided in 2012 to include all flights entering and leaving the EU in their Emission Trading System (EU ETS). It was quickly changed to only include travel within the EU. Nevertheless, as the largest cap-and-trade system in the world, the purpose of the EU ETS is to control the growth of emissions by issuing pollution permit rights. The idea is that by setting an emission ceiling and allowing trade between sectors, emission abatement will happen where it is cheapest and easiest to do. This paper explores whether the EU ETS succeeded in reducing the aviation sector emissions over the period 2012–2018 by employing a General Synthetic Control model to estimate a counterfactual scenario. When using jet fuel consumption as a proxy for emissions, the results indicate that on average the EU ETS led to a 10 per cent increase in jet fuel consumption relative to a scenario where it was not implemented. However, the paper fails to conclude a causal relationship between EU ETS and jet fuel consumption due to drawbacks with the data. Nevertheless, it provides a starting point for future ex-post research concerned with aviation and carbon pricing in the European market.","[""abstract""]"

A $70 carbon price raises revenues of 1.5% of GDP or more for most countries. The efficiency costs of a $70 carbon price are typically well below 1% of GDP while domestic environmental cobenefits (e.g., reductions in air pollution deaths) typically offset, or greatly exceed, efficiency costs. The emissions and fiscal benefits of other policies (e.g., partial pricing, taxes on individual fuels) are generally well below those of comprehensive pricing, although coal taxes are relatively effective in some cases. A combination of measures to improve energy efficiency and lower power generation emission rates has an effectiveness of around 60%–75% relative to comprehensive carbon pricing.","[""abstract""]"

Our findings are (1) the establishment of the carbon market will help the manufacturer reduce its carbon emission, especially for those sensitive to the carbon price and those with too much emissions; (2) whether the manufacturer turns to the online channel depends on the consumers’ sensitivity to the sales service, and consumers’ attention will guide the way to the online mode; (3) which mode is conducive to carbon emission reduction relies on the product type: the e-commerce platform does well for daily necessities of mass production while the traditional channel is better for experience goods.","[""abstract""]"

Among other options, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is being considered as a potential technology for decarbonising the power sector. Consequently, it is important to quantify the relative benefits and trade-offs of coal-CCS in comparison to its competing renewable power sources from multiple sustainability perspectives. In this paper, we assess coal-CCS pathways in India up to 2050 and compare coal-CCS with conventional coal, solar PV and wind power sources through an integrated assessment approach coupled with a nexus perspective (energy-cost-climate-water nexus). Our levelized costs assessment reveals that coal-CCS is expensive and significant cost reductions would be needed for CCS to compete in the Indian power market. In addition, although carbon pricing could make coal-CCS competitive in relation to conventional coal power plants, it cannot influence the lack of competitiveness of coal-CCS with respect to renewables. From a climate perspective, CCS can significantly reduce the life cycle GHG emissions of conventional coal power plants, but renewables are better positioned than coal-CCS if the goal is ambitious climate change mitigation. Our water footprint assessment reveals that coal-CCS consumes an enormous volume of water resources in comparison to conventional coal and, in particular, to renewables. To conclude, our findings highlight that coal-CCS not only suffers from typical new technology development related challenges—such as a lack of technical potential assessments and necessary support infrastructure, and high costs—but also from severe resource constraints (especially water) in an era of global warming and the competition from outperforming renewable power sources. Our study, therefore, adds a considerable level of techno-economic and environmental nexus specificity to the current debate about coal-based large-scale CCS and the low carbon energy transition in emerging and developing economies in the Global South.","[""abstract""]"

During the last decades international attention has focused on this issue, as well as on searching for viable solutions to mitigate global warming. In this context, the pricing of greenhouse gas emissions turned out to be the most prominent mechanism: First, to lower the emissions, and second, to capture their external costs. By now, various carbon dioxide taxes have been adopted by several countries in Europe and around the world; moreover, the list of these countries is growing. However, there is no standardized approach and the price for carbon varies significantly from one country to another. Regionally diversified carbon prices in turn lead to carbon leakage, which will offset the climate protection goals. In this paper, a simplified European power system with flexible carbon prices regarding the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is investigated. A distribution parameter that quantifies carbon leakage is defined and varied together with the base carbon price, where the combination of both parameters describes the spatially resolved price distribution, i.e. the effective carbon pricing among the European regions. It is shown that inhomogeneous carbon prices will indeed lead to significant carbon leakage across the continent, and that coal-fired electricity generation will remain a cheap and therefore major source of power in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe representing a potential risk for the long term decarbonization targets within the European Union. ∗schlott@fias.uni-frankfurt.de ar X iv :2 10 5. 05 66 9v 1 [ ec on .G N ] 1 2 M ay 2 02 1 Carbon Leakage in a European Power System with Inhomogeneous Carbon Prices PREPRINT","[""abstract"",""title""]"

 Background: The increasing awareness about climate change and the adverse effects of global mean temperature increasing beyond +1.5 ∘ C above pre-industrial levels resulted in a historic international climate agreement in December 2015 in Paris. Countries around the globe published their intended Nationally Determined Contributions (hereafter iNDCs)–converted into Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), committing to take actions post-2020 to tackle global warming, mainly to mitigate greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The Brazilian NDC established absolute emissions targets of 1.3 GtCO 2 e by 2025 and of 1.2 GtCO 2 e by 2030 (GWP-100, AR5), corresponding to reductions of 37% and 43%, respectively, compared to 2005. In this work, we studied the role that each economic sector can play to meet the Brazilian NDC through an integrated assessment modeling (IAM) approach. Results: The analysis showed that the AFOLU (Agriculture, Forestry and Land-Use) sector would contribute with mitigation amounts of 25.5 MtCO 2 e in 2025 and 145.8 MtCO 2 e in 2030, considering implementation of no-regret abatement measures (LC0) and LC10 scenario, which implies an economic effort to internalize a carbon price of US$ 10/tCO 2 e in the economy, respectively. Potential emissions reductions in the energy system would contribute to the mitigation of 60.4 MtCO 2 e in 2025 and 211.1 MtCO 2 e in 2030. Additionally, we identified critical measures with higher mitigation potential, for instance, commercially planted forests, integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems, no-tillage systems, biological nitrogen fixation application, intensification of livestock production through cattle confinement, deforestation reduction, expansion of native vegetation, and degraded pastures recovery in the AFOLU sector. Regarding the energy system, the integrated modeling demonstrated high mitigation potential in measures related to energy efficiency in the industry, waste management, and transport sectors; as well as a modal shift from individual to collective passenger transport and highways to railways and waterways to load transportation, and energy utilization of urban solid waste and effluent of treatment plants for the production of biomethane and electricity. Conclusions: Projected emissions for 2025 demonstrate that the NDC target for this year could be achieved with the LC0 scenario (carbon value equal to zero) implementation, while the NDC target for 2030 could be achieved by implementing the LC10 scenario in 2030.","[""abstract""]"

It is worth noting that the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere has always been a function of oil and gas production itself. Therefore, it is not possible to reduce CO2 by means of reducing oil and gas production. One of the biggest challenges in reducing CO2 emission in Indonesia’s oil and gas industries is the constantly growing need of fossil fuel as well as the lack of carbon tax on Indonesia’s law. Carbon tax, in which a tax is imposed carbon generating activities, has been successfully applied in several countries, but not in Indonesia. Currently Indonesian government is developing presidential decree of carbon pricing in order to accelerate the fulfilment of Indonesian NDC (Nationally Determined Contribution) and on the same time the carbon credit excess could be offered to International communities. 
 
New discoveries of oil and gas fields in same areas in Indonesia, especially in Java and Sumatra Islands, have now shifted into CO2 rich fields, where the CO2 will become a major obstacle in developing the fields economically. One of the issues in developing CO2 rich fields is how to dispose the CO2 safely or even adding some added value into the disposed CO2. This paper offers an alternative of disposing CO2 from CO2 rich gas fields by injecting it into oil and gas reservoir by means of CO2-EOR or CO2-EGR. Despite its urgency, CO2-EOR and CO2-EGR has not been implemented on a full field scale in Indonesia, but some studies have been conducted, e.g. in Gundih and Tangguh fields. In order to increase the understanding that CO2-EOR or CO2-EGR implementation in Indonesia will be economic beneficial projects, we propose to build a cluster-based approach of CO2 management all around Indonesia. Bades on the developed system, it is hoped that one can see that the costs of CO2 transportation will be minimum, because the distance between several CO2 sources and potential CO2 sinks are close one to the others. Besides that, one can predict easily that there will be potentially additional recovery from the injected CO2 to the oil and gas fields through the implementation of CO2-EOR or CO2-EGR. 
 
The case study in East Java region is shown in this paper. This study presents an effort to classify CO2 source and sink that could be connected to future CO2-EOR and CO2-EGR activities in a near future. Oil and gas exploitation activities in this area yields substantial production with high CO2 content, therefore efforts should be taken to utilize the CO2, not only as flared gas that has the potential to pollute its surrounding areas. It is then decided that the CO2 will be utilized as EOR/EGR media to nearby fields, however, care should be taken in order to ensure the economic and technical aspect of CO2 injection itself. Three clusters are defined, i.e. 30 km, 60 km and 90 km in order to distinguish between prioritized fields and less prioritized fields. Prior to field selection and calculation, screening processes are performed based on available criteria in order to find the most suitable target fields based on reservoir properties and the remaining oil in place. 
 
As conclusion, this paper addresses an effort to map potential of CO2-EOR and CO2-EGR nearby East Java oil and gas fields as well as power plant in Indonesia, where the potential application of CO2-EOR in Indonesia would reach 400 BSCF of CO2 sequestered and possibility of 56 MMBO additional oil extracted. It is hoped that this study could be used as a reference on how to develop cost efficient CO2-EOR and CO2-EGR in Indonesia.","[""abstract""]"

To give national governments ample incentive to pursue deep decarbonization, mutual interstate coercion will be necessary. Many proposed tools of coercive climate diplomacy would require a one-dimensional metric for comparing the stringency of climate change mitigation policy packages across jurisdictions. This article proposes and defends such a metric: the carbon price equivalent. There is substantial variation in the set of climate change mitigation policy instruments implemented by different countries. Nonetheless, the consequences of any combination of these policies can be summarized in terms of aggregate emissions during a specified period. Given differences in geography, resource endowments, levels of development, demographics, and other boundary conditions, aggregate emissions do not lend themselves to meaningful direct comparisons of climate change mitigation efforts. However, there will always be some carbon price that, if implemented in an otherwise neutral policy environment, would have produced this observed level of aggregate emissions during a specified period. This is the carbon price equivalent of the package of policies that produced that level of aggregate emissions. The carbon price equivalent can also be thought of as the weighted average emissions allowance trading price that would have prevailed under a cap and trade system implemented in an otherwise neutral policy environment, with the cap set to match observed aggregate emissions over some period. The carbon price equivalent metric has several applications, including strategic emissions policies, strong trade linkage, and border adjustment of domestic emissions taxes and regulations. This article sets forth procedures for estimating national carbon price equivalents, including a specification of the otherwise neutral policy environment. Design issues and challenges involving currency conversions, production versus consumption emissions, spillover effects of domestic climate policies, use of a social cost of carbon to set regulatory policy, and greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide are analyzed and resolved. A normative case for the carbon price equivalent metric is advanced in terms of both justice and efficiency. Alternative metrics are considered and found inadequate.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This paper provides empirical evidence that risk aversion also plays an important role in the coal contracting behavior of US power plants. Specifically, I show that plants facing more spot coal price uncertainty sign longer duration coal contracts, purchase contract coal from a larger number of origin counties, and pay higher contract coal prices. One plausible mechanism for this risk aversion is that regulators are less likely to incorporate high input cost realizations into the regulated output price they set for electric utilities. Using my estimate of plant-level risk aversion, I calculate that the ratio of the aggregate costs incurred by plants under cap and trade relative to a carbon tax is 1.27. This highlights the importance of implementing climate policy that limits carbon price volatility.","[""abstract""]"

I develop a model in which countries differ in the co-benefits that they derive from emissions reductions and also in their aversion to taxing carbon. Assuming a uniform type distribution and linear demand functions for the fossil fuel, I provide an explicit solution for the optimal mechanism. It can be implemented through a reward payment function of the following form: each country is rewarded based on how much (if at all) its carbon tax exceeds a certain reference level. The reward payment is quadratic in this amount if the global institution's budget is small. For large budgets, there is an additional term that is linear in the amount that the carbon tax exceeds the reference level. Empirical calibrations suggest that carbon pricing reward funds could play a valuable role if the world mobilizes substantial additional funding for supporting emissions reductions in developing countries.","[""abstract""]"

Nevertheless, the geographical and sectoral coverage of substantial carbon pricing remains low, often due to concerns that it may increase economic inequality. Regulatory standards such as fuel economy standards are more popular. Could it be the case that they have an equity advantage over carbon pricing? We develop two formal models to identify economic situations in which standards have better distributional consequences. First, we prove that an efficiency standard can be more equitable than carbon pricing when consumers exhibit a preference for high-carbon technology attributes. Evidence from the US vehicle market confirms this finding. Second, we show theoretically, and by means of a numerical application to the Chinese transport sector, that intensity standards are preferable when richer households consume more goods with high carbon intensity. Our results hold when the revenue from carbon pricing is not very progressively redistributed. These insights may help advance decarbonisation when pricing remains unpopular.","[""abstract""]"

Carbon pricing is integral to bringing about this behavioural change and embedding a price or cost for carbon in economic activities is essential. An initial step to achieve this would be to build a global, or even international, carbon market through which a stable carbon price or price range could be established. Given the ever increasing urgency of the need for concrete and effective action, yet the ever decreasing timeframe in which to do so, the Earth’s atmosphere cannot afford the luxury of many further years to reach acceptable, negotiated, compromise agreements that may or may not, ultimately, make any real difference to anthropogenic impact on the climate: innovative approaches and thinking are needed now.

Addressing it will require deep economic transformations within and across national borders, and a mix of ambition and pragmatism about what nations’ individual political and legal constraints will permit. So far, existing approaches have failed to produce the necessary levels of emissions reduction. President Biden’s election, however, offers a chance for a new beginning. <br><br>This working paper reviews the intersection of climate and trade policy, and in particular the divergent paths that conversations on decarbonization are taking in the US and European Union (EU). While the EU has made carbon pricing central to its decarbonization policy, the Biden administration has promised a new approach that deploys regulatory tools (standards) and industrial policy (investments). Both the US and the EU recognize the need to support their domestic decarbonization policies with a trade policy that prevents carbon leakage and reduces the embedded carbon consumed domestically via international trade. But the divergence in domestic approaches could put the two trading partners on an unnecessary collision course where trade is concerned. <br><br>We argue that the US, the EU, and like-minded countries should harvest an early win in the fight against the climate crisis by imposing a common external tariff on carbon-intensive steel imports, while — as the Paris Agreement contemplates — allowing each other flexibility to pursue a range of decarbonization strategies domestically. Over time, this sectoral strategy — common external trade barriers on carbon-intensive imports combined with flexibility to choose among a range of domestic decarbonization measures — can and should be expanded to other industries. <br><br>The steel industry is the ideal sector in which to begin transatlantic cooperation on trade and climate. It is one of the largest emitters of carbon in the manufacturing sector, is on track to consume 50 percent of available carbon budgets by 2050, is highly exposed to trade, and is already subject to extensive policy controls over which the US and EU are in negotiations. These elements make it an excellent candidate for an early demonstration both of how climate cooperation could be achieved later in other tradable industries and how trade policy can advance climate objectives. <br><br>Our primary point of entry into this conversation is through governance and trade law questions, including at the World Trade Organization (WTO). Our analysis foregrounds legal and political constraints. In so doing, our hope is to offer a structure that sets activists, policymakers, economists, engineers, and others up for demonstrable success. And by converting a climate-blocking industry into a climate-supporting industry, the proposal alters climate politics and makes future climate supporting action more likely.","[""abstract""]"

Results revealed that, 68709.424 MWh and 9430.446MWh were saved and displaced by the EE and RE projects respectively annually, accounting for 48157.668 tCO 2 e emissions reduced annually. This accounts for a 63.12% emissions reduction from the baseline scenario and represents a huge potential for the CDM, ready to be harnessed. The total amount of emissions reduced could generate about 48157.668 Certified Emissions Reduction (CERs) yearly. Considering a carbon price of $10/tCO 2 e and a 10-year fixed crediting period starting from 2020 would imply a total revenue of $4815766.8 in 2030 from the CERs , which will increase the sector’s attractiveness to investors.

 We build a continuous-time stochastic real options model to study the abandonment strategy of carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. Based on the stochastic optimal control theory, we solve the problem with the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman variational inequality (HJBVI) to derive the evolution of the optimal CCS investment over time. Using optimal stopping time, we establish a free boundary for each time node over the entire CCS construction stage as a function of the market carbon price and the individual project's remaining total deployment investment. The boundary is to help the investors decide whether to keep investing or abandon the project. Numerical simulations based on Chinese data are conducted by applying the finite element method with the power penalty. Concerning a hypothetical CCS project with a remaining total deployment investment of 10 billion RMB, our projected critical carbon prices relevant to its decisions on CCS project in 2020 are, respectively, 137.27 RMB/ton CO2 (0.123 RMB/kW·h) and 104.14 RMB/ton CO2 (0.093 RMB/kW·h). Being well below either threshold, if the current price prevails in 2020, the private investors will have no incentive to keep investing in or operate the above CCS project. It seems to us that this should indicate the exact right moment for the government to consider subsidizing them with at least the amount of money to prevent their abandonment of CCS from happening.","[""abstract""]"

It comprises 17 partners and is coordinated by BRGM (France). STRATEGY CCUS aims to provide realistic strategic plans from 2025 to 2050 for deploying carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) in Southern and Eastern Europe, from a local to a European scale. Eight promising regions, within seven countries are being studied. Plans and roadmaps for these regions will be developed based on economic and environmental drivers, technical potential and social acceptance. 
The deployment of operational CCUS clusters starts by an appraisal at local and regional level. Available data for each promising region was mapped to indicate the technical potential of CCUS development in each region. Relevant groups of stakeholders were identified and invited to form Regional Stakeholder Committees within each promising region. These committees are working with project partners to consider regional factors and concerns as well as to elaborate scenarios of CCUS deployment in their respective regions to ensure early local participation. In the 3 most promising regions for the deployment of CCUS, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Multiregional Input Output (MRIO) analysis and Techno-Economic Assessment (TEA) designs will provide decision-support for the sustainable development of CCUS. Sound insights and a comprehensive diagnosis of the potential local business models associated with the different CCUS options will be provided for each region, as well as estimates for the sensitivity of the business model on storage capacity and injectivity data. 
CCUS roadmaps from 2025 to 2050 for each of the promising regions, with optional connections to existing CO2 infrastructure in the North Sea, will be elaborated. Scenarios will be based on the available relevant data and carried out in close exchange with the local stakeholders via the Regional Stakeholder Committees and the Industrial Club. Economic evaluation of each scenario will provide the main Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as cumulated CAPEX/OPEX required for each scenario, the cost breakdown per CCUS stakeholder, or for example the global costs expressed in €/t CO2 avoided per scenario. Lastly, an economic impact assessment will be performed at national and European levels in terms of volumes of quotas avoided for industries included in the European Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with the CCUS scenarios and in terms of economic impact on the EU ETS carbon price. Exploitation and dissemination of the project’s results and findings engage with relevant end-users (industry and policy makers, local authorities), in order to pave the way for the operational implementation of CCUS clusters. The project is providing targeted information to multiple audiences (including the media and the public) and favoring dialogue, with a public policy perspective. 
The systematic approach followed by STRATEGY CCUS will facilitate the appraisal of new other promising regions and the creation of connection among them for the deployment of CCUS Europe-wide.","[""abstract""]"

One of the main polluters is the energy sector, which includes transport. Despite the seemingly small share of aviation in emissions, its role as a polluter and CO2 emitter cannot be underestimated due to calculated specific rate and a number of factors that were researched. The purpose of this study was to analyze the aviation share in the polluters’ structure and to study if Covid-19 restrictions influence on it, to investigate the share of CO2 emissions from air transport in Ukraine and to assess its impact, to forecast CO2 emissions in Ukraine by 2030 and to build scenarios of possible changes in the direction of decarbonization in the aviation industry. Analysis and synthesis, comparison, methods of pairwise regression and modelling scenarios were used for solving these tasks. The results show that the aviation industry could achieve the carbon reduction targets only by applying different types of carbon pricing with conducting the research and development in the sphere. The last significant improvement in aircraft design technologies and flight operations was achieved almost 60 years ago. Economic incentives at the international and local scales should be used to stimulate aviation manufacturers to invest significant money on R&D to find stable solutions to achieve decarbonization. Development of Ukrainian aviation industry should not stand aside from global trends and must meet modern challenges, including environmental issues.

This regulation set product benchmark emissions intensities and required that facilities purchase emissions credits for the portion of emissions that fell above that product benchmark. With a focus on Alberta’s oil and gas industry, this paper assesses mechanisms used under the CCIR to address competitiveness-driven carbon leakage for emissions-intensive and trade-exposed sectors. These mechanisms include exclusions, output-based allocations and financial compensation in the form of market-based compliance flexibility and access to innovation funding. The CCIR also provided additional cost containment for facilities that demonstrated significant economic risk resulting from carbon compliance costs. The output-based allocation, which is the primary policy mechanism for addressing competitiveness, is compared with the carbon pricing system in California. This review suggests that the CCIR failed to provide evidence that emission allocation levels were sufficient to mitigate carbon leakage. Further, the system’s definition of competitiveness failed to incorporate the ability to attract new investment, which is particularly important for the oil and gas sector due to its capital-intensive nature. Understanding policy options for protecting industry competitiveness from carbon pricing may help to inform future regulatory design that mitigates the likelihood of carbon leakage.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

An instrument to guide their reduction efforts is internal carbon pricing. Next to choosing the right pricing tool, defining the exact value of an internal carbon price, especially against the background of potential regulatory external carbon prices, and assessing its impact on business units’ energy systems poses a challenge for organisations. The academic literature has so far not examined the impact differences of an internal carbon price across different countries, which this paper addresses by using an optimisation model. First, it analyses the energy system cost increase of a real-world facility based on an internal carbon price compared to a potential regulatory carbon price within a country. Second, we evaluate the energy system cost increase based on an internal carbon price across different countries. The results show that with regard to internal carbon prices the additional total system cost compared to potential external carbon prices stays within 9%, 15%, and 59% for Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom, respectively. The increase in the energy system cost in each country varies between 3% and 93%. For all countries, the cost differences can be reduced by allowing the installation of renewables. The integration of renewables via energy storage and power-to-heat technologies depends on the renewable potentials and the availability of carbon capture and storage. If organisations do not account for these differences, it might raise the disapproval of internal carbon prices within the organisation.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This article explores how other market and policy drivers affect wind and PV value factors and capture prices in real-world settings over the next three decades. To this end, we model and analyse a number of scenarios with altered natural gas, coal and carbon prices as well as varied availabilities of wind and PV in Europe. We find that higher natural gas and carbon prices result in lower wind and PV value factors and vice versa, while the influence of coal prices is rather limited.

The way in which a government allocates carbon tax revenues is a key factor in the public’s acceptance of carbon pricing policy and ultimately in its enduring success. To that end, this article presents an innovative, simple classification framework of carbon tax revenue usage which has four modalities to cater for various policy design features. These are: a constrained approach as opposed to an unconstrained one; a revenue-neutral recycling approach as opposed to a revenue-raising one; an approach according to public preference; and a thematic approach. Thereafter, various attributes are examined to assist policymakers in selecting an appropriate modality. The classification framework will be useful for policymakers as a quick point of reference before embarking on more complex and in-depth policy deliberations. Key policy insights Carbon pricing is the most cost-effective regulatory approach for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and is recognized as a significant contributor to government revenue. Carbon tax revenue use can be classified into four overarching modalities to cater for various policy design attributes. There is no dominating revenue use option from an economic or political viewpoint, owing to trade-offs across various fiscal policy objectives. Carbon taxes are elements of broader tax reform and therefore revenue use options should be aligned with a jurisdiction’s broader fiscal policy charter.","[""abstract""]"

The results suggest overall progressive welfare effects in the range of 0.1 – 4.9% across the population. We further observe declines in the demand for electricity, kerosene and transport in the range of 4 – 20%, with concomitant shifts within food consumption baskets, due to complementarities with cooking fuels, and income effects. Heterogeneous demand responses across expenditure terciles and rural-urban areas reveal significant disparities in food and calorie consumption as well as protein and micronutrient intake due to carbon pricing.

 Background: Until 50 years ago, Xishuangbanna was a heavy forest-covered region with high biodiversity. Attributed to the rubber boom that took place in the region during the last decades, natural forest area decreased quickly and was replaced by monoculture rubber plantations (Hevea brasiliensis). To slow down the deforestation rate and encourage rubber plantation retiring, a market and government-combined compensatory payment system was developed with consideration of market-priced ecosystem services. Results: In the baseline scenario, the annual retiring rate reduced from 9,353±17.8 ha to 4,669±18.5 ha in the projection period, and the final total retiring area in 2050 was 202.477±0.063 thousand ha. The compensatory payment increased along with the growth of rubber plantations. In the projected period (2021-2050), the total NPV (net present value) of compensatory payment was $3,364.820±1.669 million. The total carbon sequestration benefit resulting from replacement of artificial rainforests was 11.718±0.005 million tC. In sensitivity analyses, more uncertainties of compensatory payment were expected with a higher variation of rubber price. The rise of carbon price, discount rate and traditional medicine price, and the decrease of rubber price and final retiring rate could reduce the total NPV of payment. Conclusions: The market and government-combined payment system has high possibility to effectively encourage rubber retiring and reduce government payment. By the projection of the market and government-combined payment system, most of the small patches of rubber plantation were disappeared in 2050. The annual retiring area decreased gradually along the projection period. The projected compensatory payment and the area-specific payment increased, while the increment of compensatory payment decreased. The carbon sequestration benefit by rubber plantation retiring was negative in the first decade. All the tested factors (i.e., rubber price, rubber price variation, carbon price, final retiring rate, discount rate, and traditional medicine price) could affect the compensatory payment. Currently, the payment system may not so attractive; however, the situation could change when more market-priced ecosystem services are involved in the system.","[""abstract""]"

Private vehicles are themselves responsible for around half of the CO2 emissions resulting from transport. This paper proposes to analyse a conversion premium granted in 2019, designed for households willing to get rid of their old cars in order to buy low emissions ones. It displays descriptive statistics of the beneficiaries’ characteristics and of the vehicles scrapped along with those bought thanks to the subsidy. The study further proceeds with an ex-post socio-economic analysis of the measure. The data comes from the national agency allocating the bonus. The conversion premium scheme (PAC) provides benefits to users and society by accelerating the replacement of older vehicles by more efficient, less polluting vehicles with lower maintenance costs. In 2018, a first scheme was analysed ex-post, but in 2019 the rules of the PAC changed twice for better fitting more focused environmental and distributive objectives, following the “gilets jaunes” events. In 2019, around 350 000 people benefited from the measure, which includes additional incentives for low income households and long-distance commuters. The paper will, first, provide descriptive statistics regarding beneficiaries’ income, their age and living area. Information on the scrapped vehicles and purchased ones (new vehicles or recent second hand cars) will also be given concerning fuel, emissions, prices, etc. Results are soon to be obtained (in March 2020), but the data arrived too recently at the time of abstract submission to be able to show results for 2019 data. Here are some insights on the findings obtained and assumptions used for the 2018 PAC, that will illustrate qualitatively the type of results and the modelling that will be presented in the paper. Based on data provided by the State Payment Services Agency containing information on 253 000 beneficiaries of the PAC in 2018, the PAC benefited rather rural households (living in municipalities of 1000 inhabitants per square km on average), income tax-free in 72% of cases, and allowed for the scrapping of old vehicles (19 years old), 80 % running on diesel, to replace them with newer and less polluting vehicles. The vehicles purchased had an average unit emission rate of 106 gCO2 / km, lower than all new vehicles (112 gCO2 / km) purchased the same year, they were essentially diesel (48%) and gasoline (47%) and 2% are all electric. About two-thirds of them were EURO6 standard (the most recent one). They were mostly purchased second-hand (60% of the cases). The average purchase price was 13 200 €, but a difference of 2 200 € was observed depending on whether the acquiring household was taxable or not. Most of the environmental gains are perceived in the short term, over the period corresponding to the anticipated duration of the purchase (assumed here of 6 months for taxable households, 2 years for non-taxable households or 1.56 years in average). During this period, instead of old polluting vehicles, new or recent vehicles are running. For CO2 and fuel, however, profits continue beyond this period. The vehicles purchased under the CP are supposed to be of the same engine but more efficient than those that would have been purchased without the CAP 6 months or 2 years later. This performance gain prevails over the life of the vehicle. The cost related to a year of anticipation of the purchase of a new vehicle is equal to the product of the purchase price of the new vehicle by the discount rate. The discount rate used for the socioeconomic assessment is 4.5%. For the assessment for the user, a rate of 8% is used for non-taxable households and 4,5% for taxable households. To this anticipation cost is added an additional purchase cost related to the performance gain of the vehicle, assumed to be 500 € HTT. The vehicles are furthermore assumed to drive 12 000 km per year. Our analysis furthermore allows to perform a socio-economic analysis of the measure, drawing up two assessments:  A socio-economic one taking into account environmental benefits (CO2, fine particles, NOx), gains in fuel consumption, gains in maintenance costs, extra cost due to the anticipation of the purchase of a new and more efficient vehicle ;  An assessment from the user point of view taking into account the gains in fuel consumption and maintenance costs, and the additional cost of purchasing a new vehicle in advance; including all taxes. We illustrate here again the types of results obtained for the former PAC scheme. As a whole, the net present value was positive (65 M€), especially due to the gains in terms of local pollution. The main gain, 220 million €, arose from the reduction of air pollution due to fine particles and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The emissions of NOx and fine particles got reduced respectively by 2 700 and 240 tons. The fuel savings were worth 75 M€. Savings in maintenance costs amounted to 60 million €. CO2 gains were estimated for fuel combustion in situ and ""upstream"" (fuel production and distribution), which corresponded to 440 000 tons (approximately 40% within 2 years, and 60% over 14 years thereafter) and valued 25 M € with a carbon price of CO2 of 54 €/ton. All of these benefits (375M €) were higher than the additional costs related to the anticipated purchase (310 M €). This overall assessment showed disparities at the vehicle level: in more than two thirds of vehicle level cases, the overall assessment was negative or zero. It was positive in more than 3⁄4 cases in densely populated geographic areas (> 1000 inhab./km2), where the social cost associated with air pollution is the highest. The assessment was typically positive under the following conditions: when a diesel (strongly emitting fine particles) is replaced by another engine, or when the vehicle acquired is an electric vehicle or a vehicle with low CO2 emission. Finally, the environmental balance was slightly better for non-taxable households, consistent with the assumption that the premium has a strong behavioral effect and leads them to further foresee their purchase (2 years, against 6 months for taxable households). As a result, the environmental benefits are greater because they run longer, although the cost of anticipating the purchase is also greater. In addition, non-taxable households mostly scrap diesel vehicles. The average car buyer benefited from the PAC, but the purchase he/she made would not have been profitable for her/him – hence not made, or for a car that would have been more environment harmful The main gains for the purchaser were due to fuel savings (155 M €) and the reduction of the maintenance costs (75 M €) of the vehicle (old vehicles exhibit mileage costs approximately twice as high). In the absence of PAC, the gain for all acquirers (€ 230 million) would not have covered the cost of anticipating the purchase (€ 535 million), leading to a negative net balance sheet (€ 305 million). Again this broad picture becomes more diverse at the individual level. Still, it stays negative in 92% of cases, in the absence of PAC. In particular, it is less degraded for the purchaser when it moves from a gasoline vehicle to a recent diesel or from a heat engine to an electric vehicle. It therefore seems that public intervention is justified, because the owners of old vehicles do not have, according to these analyzes, sufficient individual incentives to replace them by recent vehicles, even though it brings a gain for society as a whole. If we take into account the conversion premiums paid to the buyers, the balance sheet becomes positive in almost all cases, with an overall net gain of 140 million €. Please note that no gain related to the buyer's valuation of the environmental improvement ""per se"" was taken in account, which could explain his decision to purchase despite a seemingly small negative balance sheet) . The same kind of analyses will be made for the 2019 PAC, with finer observations since the scheme became more differentiated. Indeed, in the last period of 2019, four revenue levels are distinguished, combined with 6 types of low-emitting vehicles. As usual, the reference scenario will be discussed, distinguishing several periods consistently with the dates the rules of the conversion premium got changed. The study will conclude by commenting on the efficiency of the subsidy with respect to its environmental and distributive objectives. Short abstract: This paper presents descriptive statistics and an ex-post socio-economic analysis of a conversion premium implemented in France for the year 2019. This conditional subsidy is designed as an incentive for replacing old vehicles by more efficient and less polluting ones. The impacts and the efficiency of this public policy with respect to its environmental and distributive objectives are discussed.","[""abstract""]"

The findings are as follows. First, carbon price is important in adjusting the emission reductions of different owners to minimize the total social cost of emission-reduction measures. Second, the price of carbon-emission permits has a significant impact on the investment threshold and decision-making behavior of public building owners. Finally, reducing the cost of energy-conservation and emission-reduction technologies in public buildings and appropriately subsidizing owners for their emission-reduction investment were effective methods to motivate them to participate in carbon emission trading. The results were used to quantitatively analyze the impact of a carbon emission trading mechanism on the decision-making behavior of public building owners and to construct the carbon emission trading mechanism used in China’s public building industry.","[""abstract""]"

In the energy generation part of the model, the substitutability between green and dirty energy is endogenized such that firms can invest into substitutability enhancing infrastructure that allows for a fossil fuel phase-out to take place for reasonable carbon tax schedules. We find that, if substitutability improvements in the final energy generation process, involving green and dirty energy, are physically and economically feasible, there will be a technological tipping point that is triggered at some level of climate policy (carbon price or green energy subsidies) after which a rapid decarbonization of the energy sector becomes possible. Equipped with this mechanism for phasing out the fossil fuel sector, we consider the financial implications of key stylized facts, like the high capital intensity of renewables, and find that, in the presence of performance-based lending, the need for a fast accumulation of green capital during the transition can slow down the phase-out and can potentially lead to financial instability. To ensure a swift and robust transition, direct supportive policy measures for renewables can be used, which, depending on technological developments, might need to be permanent.","[""abstract""]"

This is because most emissions covered by carbon pricing and markets stem from industries with high energy use, and because carbon prices suppress the consumption of energy through directing the choice of fuels away from emissions-intensive fuels. A global price on carbon has been touted as the solution to climate change by actors across the political and geographical spectrum, especially economists (Ball 2018). It is no surprise then that the last ten years have seen a surge in international and transnational institutions aimed at promoting carbon pricing and carbon markets. A couple of such institutions have existed since the 1990s (most notably the International Emissions Trading Association, IETA), but most have appeared since 2007 (Sanderink et al. 2016). These institutions have promoted carbon taxes and emissions trading, as well as systems for the offsetting of emissions. More specifically, the general promotion of placing a price on carbon has taken its shape in the form of the setting of standards and commitments, information-sharing and networking, operational activities such as pilot and demonstration projects, and, to a lesser degree, financing. The overall purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the existing carbon pricing and trading institutions. Specific attention lies on mapping out their focus areas and points of interaction that shape the roles, areas of specialization, and underlying norms that relate to the pricing of carbon emissions. We illustrate that carbon-pricing institutions constitute a subfield of interconnected and interactive parts, which together perform crucial tasks of carbon taxing, emissions trading, and offsetting; all directed toward promoting wider carbon-pricing efforts.

But when there are inefficiencies in the allocation of capital so that consumers in different countries face different discount rates, we show that efficient carbon prices must be different across countries. This is a consequence of Hotelling’s familiar argument on the price of a non-renewable resource: it must grow at the rate of the next best use of marginal funds, which is equal to the country’s discount rate. If different countries discount at different rates, their carbon prices ought to grow at different rates as well. If they grow at different rates, they can’t be the same all of the time, as first-best carbon prices are. The computational climate policy literature has so far avoided this conclusion by altering time preferences in a country specific way through time-varying Negishi weights. We show that the use of such weights causes inefficient policy prescriptions and, furthermore, has the particularly undesirable consequence of incorrectly discounting future consumption more in countries with high growth rates. The existence of inefficiencies in the savings process - causing differences in discount rates - is well-known and should be acknowledged head on in climate policy analysis. Doing so results in global mitigation policy with carbon price paths for different countries growing (efficiently) at different rates.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Model simulations show that thanks to the green public spending, the policy package boosts global output relative to the baseline for the first 15 years of the low-carbon transition.

We find that carbon price harmonization yields efficiency gains at the EU level. The distributional effects between countries vary and depend largely on the redistribution of carbon revenues. Based on the rules currently in place in Phase IV of the EU ETS, efficiency gains flow disproportionately to low-income countries. Within-country incidence is progressive or neutral for most countries when revenue redistribution is ignored, and is not much affected by carbon price harmonization. Per-capita-based revenue redistribution rules lead to strong progressive outcomes and yield gains for low-income households.

While many countries seek to set carbon prices, significant price dispersion and policy stringency continue to raise concerns about competitiveness. To address this issue, the EU has proposed a carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), which aims to level the playing field by levying a carbon price on EU imports. Theoretically, this mechanism would reduce the competitiveness of developing countries' exports and, therefore, shift the environmental burden from developed regions to the emerging world. In this paper, we estimate the competitiveness and welfare impacts of the EU CBAM, based on the so-called multi-regional input-output approach. We quantify changes in the value of exports to the EU market upon CBAM implementation for both EU members and non-EU countries, plus the rest of the world. It is found that the EU CBAM will lead to a redistribution of competitiveness among countries and regions, while the effect is seen to be more pronounced in emissions-intensive and trade-intensive sectors. Moreover, a deeper sub-national-level analysis on China shows that, given its pervasive domestic production network, income losses in landlocked provinces exceed their export losses, contrasting with the pattern for trade-exposed provinces.","[""abstract""]"

However, economic incentives supporting commercialization and deployment of BioEnergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) are missing. This Policy and Practice Review discusses five different models for creating incentives and financing for BECCS, using Sweden as an example: (1) governmental guarantees for purchasing BECCS outcomes; (2) quota obligation on selected sectors to acquire BECCS outcomes; (3) allowing BECCS credits to compensate for hard-to-abate emissions within the EU ETS; (4) private entities for voluntary compensation; and (5) other states acting as buyers of BECCS outcomes to meet their mitigation targets under the Paris Agreement. We conclude that successful implementation of BECCS is likely to require a combination of several of the Policy Models, implemented in a sequential manner. The governmental guarantee model (Model 1) is likely to be required in the shorter term, so as to establish BECCS. Policy Models 2 and 3 may become more influential over time once BECCS has been established and accepted. Model 3 links BECCS to a large carbon-pricing regime with opportunities for cost-effectiveness and expanded financing. We conclude that Policy Models 4 and 5 are associated with high levels of uncertainty regarding the timing and volume of negative emissions that can be expected—Thus, they are unlikely to trigger BECCS implementation in the short term, although may have roles in the longer term. Based on this study, we recommend that policymakers carefully consider a policy sequencing approach that is predictable and sustainable over time, for which further analyses are required. It is not obvious how such sequencing can be arranged, as the capacities to implement the different Policy Models are vested in different organizations (national governments, EU, private firms). Furthermore, it is important that a BECCS policy is part of an integrated climate policy framework, in particular one that is in line with policies aimed at the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the creation of a circular economy. It will be important to ensure that BECCS and the associated biomass resource are not overexploited. A well-designed policy package should guarantee that BECCS is neither used to postpone the reduction of fossil fuel-based emissions nor overused in the short term as a niche business for “greenwashing” while not addressing fossil fuel emissions.","[""abstract""]"

At the same time, based on the best fitting distribution of the prediction error of the EPS, the carbon price prediction interval is constructed as a way to explore its uncertainty. More specifically, EPS integrates the advantages of various submodels and provides more accurate point prediction results; the distribution function based on point prediction error is used to establish the prediction interval of carbon prices and to mine and analyze the volatility characteristics of carbon prices.

We develop a numerical multi-country multi-sector general equilibrium model of the EU-27 economy which resolves household income deciles, based on micro-survey data on expenditure and income, and markets for fossil fuels, electricity, and (EU-wide and national) tradeable emissions rights. We find that carbon price harmonization yields efficiency gains at the EU level. The distributional effects between countries vary and depend largely on the redistribution of carbon revenues. Based on the rules currently in place in Phase IV of the EU ETS, efficiency gains flow disproportionately to low-income countries. Within-country incidence is progressive or neutral for most countries when revenue redistribution is ignored, and is not much affected by carbon price harmonization. Per-capita-based revenue redistribution rules lead to strong progressive outcomes and yield gains for low-income households. Evaluating different policy options using a social welfare function that incorporates inequality aversion suggests that there is no trade-off between efficiency and equity in harmonizing carbon prices in the EU economy.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Consequently, there has been an increasing interest, in both academia and business, in low-carbon concretes in which Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) is partially or fully replaced with industrial side streams. However, the realization of the environmental benefits of such materials depends on how competitive they are in the construction market, where low costs are a major competitive factor. This is not straightforward, as many types of concretes exist. Raw material prices vary, and costs can be influenced by governmental regulations via carbon pricing. This study presents a case study estimating the cost prices of four different geopolymer concretes with different material compositions and carbon footprints, considering the raw material price variability and the potential impact of carbon emissions regulation (carbon price). The case study demonstrates how material mix cost comparisons can be made openly and systematically. The results imply that carbon pricing, at the rates currently applied, does not significantly change the cost price difference between traditional and geopolymer concretes. Instead, cost-competitiveness of low carbon concretes depends heavily on the material mix type and the availability of critical side streams.","[""abstract""]"

The info-gap framework allows the decision maker to maximize robustness to failure in the presence of uncertainty, where uncertainty is in the parameters of the model and failure is defined as the model output falling below some minimally acceptable performance threshold. Info-gap theory has found particular application to problems in conservation biology and ecological economics. In this study, we applied info-gap theory to an ecosystem services tradeoff case study in which a decision maker aiming to maximize ecosystem service investment returns must choose between two alternative land uses: native vegetation conservation or the establishment of an exotic timber plantation. The uncertain variables are the carbon price and the water price. With a ""no-information"" uncertainty model that assumes equal relative uncertainty across both variables, info-gap theory identifies a minimally acceptable reward threshold above which conservation is preferred, but below which plantation establishment is preferred. However, with an uncertainty model that allows the carbon price to be substantially more uncertain than the water price, conservation of native vegetation becomes an economically more robust investment option than establishing alien pine plantations. We explored the sensitivity of the results to the use of alternative uncertainty models, including asymmetric uncertainty in individual variables. We emphasize the general finding that the results of info-gap analyses can be sensitive to the choice of uncertainty model and that, therefore, future applications to ecological problems should be careful to incorporate all available qualitative and quantitative information relating to uncertainties or should at least justify the no-information uncertainty model.","[""abstract""]"

A more recent addition to the glossary of climate policy is “carbon tariff.”
 While the concept is not new, it recently surfaced in nascent policymaking in the EU. In 2019, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed a “carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM)” as part of a proposed green deal. In March, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on a World Trade Organization (WTO)-compatible CBAM.
 A carbon tariff, or the EU’s CBAM, is a tax applied to carbon-intensive imports. Countries that have pledged to be more ambitious in reducing emissions—and in some cases have implemented binding targets—may impose carbon costs on their own businesses. Being eyed now are cross-border or overseas businesses that make products in countries in which no costs are imposed for emissions, resulting in cheaper carbon-intensive goods. Those products are exported to the countries aiming for reduced emissions.
 The concern lies in the risk of locally made goods becoming unfairly disadvantaged against competitors that are not taking similar steps to deal with climate change. A carbon tariff is being considered to level the playing field: local businesses in countries applying a tariff can better compete as climate policies evolve and are adopted around the world.
 Complying with WTO rules to ensure fair treatment, the CBAM will be imposed only on high-emitting industries that compete directly with local industries paying a carbon price. In the short term, these are likely to be steel, chemicals, fertilizers, and cement.
 The Parliament’s statement introduced another term to the glossary of climate policy: carbon leakage. “To raise global climate ambition and prevent ‘carbon leakage,’ the EU must place a carbon price on imports from less climate-ambitious countries.”
 It refers to the situation that may occur if businesses were to transfer production to other countries with laxer emission constraints to avoid costs related to climate policies. This could lead to an increase in total emissions in the higher-emitting countries.
 “The resolution underlines that the EU’s increased ambition on climate change must not lead to carbon leakage as global climate efforts will not benefit if EU production is just moved to non-EU countries that have less ambitious emissions rules,” the Parliament said.
 It also emphasized the tariff “must not be misused to further protectionism.”
 A member of the environment committee, Yannick Jadot, said, “It is a major political and democratic test for the EU, which must stop being naïve and impose the same carbon price on products, whether they are produced in or outside the EU, to ensure the most polluting sectors also take part in fighting climate change and innovate towards zero carbon. This will give us the best chance of remaining below the 1.5°C warming limit, whilst also pushing our trading partners to be equally ambitious in order to enter the EU market.”
 The Commission is expected to present a legislative proposal on a CBAM in the second quarter of 2021 as part of the European Green Deal.","[""abstract""]"

 <p><strong>Bioenergy</strong> <strong>with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is one of negative-emission technologies that must be applied if we are to achieve the 1.5 &#176;C, or even the 2 &#176;C, warming targets of the Paris Agreement. As a start, existing coal-fired power plants could be retrofitted to co-fire with biofuel from agricultural and forestry residues, but the potential and costs of BECCS are as yet unassessed. Here, we modelled an optimal county-scale network of BECCS in China, by considering: spatial information on biofuel feedstock; power-plant retrofitting to increase the use of biofuel; biofuel transport to power stations and CO<sub>2</sub> transport to geological repositories for carbon storage; and BECCS life-cycle emissions. BECCS at marginal costs of $100 per tonne CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalent (t CO<sub>2-eq</sub>)<sup>-1</sup> could abate net CO<sub>2-eq</sub> emissions by up to </strong><strong>&#160;Gt yr<sup>-1</sup>, assuming that CO<sub>2</sub> emitted by power plants could be captured at 90% efficiency and accounting for additional emissions of greenhouse gases from the production cycle of BECCS. Because of the huge stock of useable agricultural and forestry residues in China, this carbon price leverages 20 times more mitigation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by BECCS in China than in western North America. To cap cumulative emissions over 2011-2030 from China&#8217;s power sector at 5% of the global remaining carbon budget for the 2 &#176;C limit since 2011, BECCS would require marginal costs of $</strong><strong>&#160;(t CO<sub>2-eq</sub>)<sup> -1</sup>, or the equivalent of investing 0.45% of GDP to generate 1.22 PWh yr<sup>-1</sup> of electricity by 2030; this would abate 35% more carbon emissions than the announced nationally determined contribution by China. These results clarify the economics of emission abatement by BECCS in China, suggesting that using the available domestic biofuel feedstock has the potential to make a great contribution to global carbon emission mitigation.</strong></p>

 To meet global climate targets, it is critical that the oil and gas industry address greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions attributable to its operations. According to the IEA, 15% of global energy-related GHG emissions arise from the process of hydrocarbon extraction and distribution. Production facilities built today may operate for 20-30 years, by which time industries, governments and countries have committed to significant reductions in emissions. If facilities are not designed with carbon neutrality in mind, there is a risk that carbon pricing may cause projects to become uneconomic before their planned end-of-life - an expensive folly. To meet GHG emission targets and de-risk projects it is essential that operators design and construct facilities with carbon neutrality in mind. This will future-proof their operations, ensuring that operators are active participants in a carbon neutral future. In fact, this is a tenet for survival in a world with pressure to decarbonise from shareholders, financial institutions, and society itself. This paper presents a pathway to the carbon neutral upstream facility. A methodology to achieve net-zero emissions for an offshore compression platform is proposed.
 The project team used a Decision Quality framework to identify methods for achieving carbon neutrality, including:
 Power import and electrification Renewable micro-grids Integration with hydrogen networks Reduction of fugitive emissions Flare system removal Facility demanning and access method Engineered offsetting methods (excluding nature-based offsetting) Digital Transformation of design and operations - remote operation and monitoring.
 Design concepts were created to test carbon neutral facilities feasibility. Expertise gained from demanning projects, along with specialist Electrical & Instrumentation experience were used, to perform a techno-economic assessment. Class 5 CAPEX and OPEX estimates were prepared and compared against a Reference Case ""traditional"" facility design. Traditional approaches to facility design were challenged at every level and an optimal, carbon neutral design was identified based on the above assessments integrating the latest techniques and technology. The study team determined the facilities lifecycle cost, identifying breakeven carbon pricing required to ensure cost-competitiveness.
 This paper demonstrates what is achievable with current technology, and opportunities for further technology development. Breakeven carbon pricing for carbon neutral facilities is presented within a range of economic scenarios. A hierarchy of technologies show those which have the biggest impact per dollar spent. This will allow operators to make informed decisions on areas that present the biggest targets for emissions reduction. The methodology can be adapted to any geographical region, considering local infrastructure and carbon pricing.
 The approach presented can be applied across many industries. Long lifespan, capital intensive projects with large GHG footprints are particularly vulnerable to carbon taxes. These projects have much to gain from adopting carbon neutrality early in system design.","[""abstract""]"

 The greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions target set by UNFCCC Paris Accord in 2016 will emerge as a new value driver to project development planning that has the potential to degrade the viability of future offshore oil and gas projects. Integration of GHG emissions and legislated carbon price as new decision drivers to project decision-making will require an in-depth understanding on the overall economic impact of carbon-conscious choices. In this light, the purpose of this paper is to present the impact of such choices on project development planning and implications for Decision Quality (DQ).
 The case study presents a comparative assessment of total GHG emissions and comparative project economics for a Greenfield project, considering four development concepts: a Reference Case with a ""traditional"" offshore facility and three hypothetical cases, each of which are defined, evaluated, and compared against the Reference Case. Development of each case is discussed and created to support decision-making during project development planning. The paper presents an economic comparison to demonstrate the importance of including a carbon assessment early in project development planning to assure a thorough concept evaluation. It also demonstrates how a clear outlook on the annual GHG intensity over project life can be vital, for project sanction and mitigation of high carbon cost penalties in the future regulatory landscape.
 Early understanding of risks associated with carbon price and regulatory enforcement can potentially change how industries analyze the viability of their projects/assets. The paper demonstrates the importance of assessing carbon-conscious options early in the project development planning stage, and how this helps developers to navigate the risks and opportunities in the drive to a lower-carbon society.","[""abstract""]"

Purpose
This paper aims to investigate potential impact of internal carbon pricing in emission reduction in Higher education institutions (HEIs). Over the past century, human activities have increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere. If GHG emissions continue their upward trend, this will disturb the natural balance and trigger abrupt changes in all components of the climate system. Limiting climate change would require a substantial and sustained reduction in GHG emissions from all sectors. HEIs, as major emitters, indeed need to respond to the demand to become more sustainable by making practical changes to the way their institution is run.


Design/methodology/approach
Using emission data associated with campus waste, this study describes how HEIs can take the lead on emission reduction through the implementation of carbon pricing.


Findings
Specifically, this study estimates the cost of emissions from campus waste to illustrate the primary benefits of internal carbon pricing for scaling up campus carbon neutrality initiatives and describes practical implications for enhancing sustainable waste management in a university setting. This study will contribute to identifying the potential for emissions reduction through waste management using a carbon pricing mechanism in university settings.


Originality/value
While carbon pricing has long been regarded as an alternative approach to tackling carbon pollution, it has not been thoroughly explored with regard to waste management.

This novel steelmaking route is compared with the established process for DR, which is based on natural gas, and with the emerging DR technology using electrolysis-generated hydrogen as the reducing gas. The DFB-DR route is found to produce reducing gas that meets the requirement of the DR reactor, based on existing MIDREX plants, and which is produced with an energetic efficiency comparable with the natural gas route. The DFB-DR path is the only route considered that allows negative CO2 emissions, enabling a 145% decrease in emissions relative to the traditional blast furnace–basic oxygen furnace (BF–BOF) route. A reducing gas cost between 45–60 EUR/MWh is obtained, which makes it competitive with the hydrogen route, but not the natural gas route. The cost estimation for liquid steel production shows that, in Sweden, the DFB-DR route cannot compete with the natural gas and BF–BOF routes without a cost associated with carbon emissions and a revenue attributed to negative emissions. When the cost and revenue are set as equal, the DFB-DR route becomes the most competitive for a carbon price >60 EUR/tCO2.","[""abstract""]"

Current trends like China’s carbon strategy “Carbon Peaking by 2030, and Carbon Neutral by 2060”, the 14th Five-year plan on new energy development, and the recent opening of China’s carbon trading market all signaled the grand start on China’s energy sustainable transition. The transportation sector is one of the biggest CO2 emitters in this system. It has been estimated that 1 standard diesel heavy-duty vehicle’s emission could potentially account for that of 100 normal gasoline-powered passenger vehicles’. Thus, it is imperative to decarbonize China’s heavy transportation sector using new energy heavy-duty vehicles. FCHDVs, like the one of the near-zero emission transport, gradually gained attractions in the energy industry. 
Thus, this paper has two objectives: 
Objective 1 investigates not only the internal factors which shaped FCHDVs' strategic position from purchasing price, environment, structural efficiency, and performance but also the external factors which might influence the core of FCHDVs’ penetration --- hydrogen cost and stations. The research on these factors is irreplaceable since the internal factors would determine if FCHDVs have a comparative advantage over diesel HDVs and the external factors will decide the fate of FCHDVs on a much broader scale and answer the questions like if FCHDVs’ hydrogen fuel is so expensive and the availability of hydrogen station is also limited, then even the FCHDVs can be cheaply made, the fleet operators would also not willing to purchase the vehicles. On the other hand, if the stations could not be easily constructed and the source of hydrogen could not be solved, then it would also cause a problem for the industry. Thus, both internal and external factors are important measurements for decision-makers. 
Objective 2 research on the comprehensive comparisons between FCHDVs, diesel HDVs, and battery HDVs from fleet operators’ perspective. The purpose of this objective is to imitate the decision-making process in the real world situation. Which option they will likely pursue based on the matrix illustration? Then an outlook of the future is presented to show the potential future of new energy HDVs’ penetrations. 
The critical insights from this research: 
1. The FCHDVs are still in their initial developing stage and the average price of FCHDVs is at least 2-3 times the price of comparative diesel HDVs. 
2. Even there are quite a lot of emissions from hydrogen production, the FCHDVs could still potentially achieve over 90% emission reduction. 
3. We can expect higher FCHDVs’ performance from their potential higher torque and instant power supply. 
4. Even the FCHDVs’ size causes a certain payload penalty in the process, the FCHDVs is still 100% more efficient than the diesel HDVs counterpart. 
5. FCHDVs potentially can achieve the same range as diesel HDVs, but diesel HDVs will still be the backbone of heavy transport in the years to come. 
6. Currently, the hydrogen production from coal in China enjoys the lowest cost but still contributes to the highest emission compared with other methods. 
7. Carbon pricing will most likely be the major factor influencing the cost of hydrogen production, making SMR hydrogen the cheapest option after 2024, and green hydrogen the cheapest option after 2030. 
8. The utilization of FCHDVs has to satisfy a series of criteria to realize. These include hydrogen stations, hydrogen sources, logistical contracts, government subsidies, and a mature transport market. 
9. The diesel HDVs still in many ways have comparative advantages other than emission. 
10. The newly – emerged battery HDVs with battery swapping stations also present strong potential as the swapping stations have more flexibility in installation requirements. 
11. In the next 10 years, the heavy transportation sector will most likely include 16-20% of new energy HDVs reaching the tipping point of transportation transition.","[""abstract""]"

According to the proposal, for the first three years from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2025, EU importers of carbon-intensive products will be required to notify a competent authority of an EU Member State of the amount of embedded carbon emissions from their imported products. Starting from January 1, 2026, they will additionally be required to purchase and surrender ""CBAM certificates"" according to the amount of embedded emissions in their imported products. The EU alleges that the CBAM intends to avoid carbon leakage and induce voluntary climate mitigation efforts on the part of its trade partners. However, since the CBAM is not only an environmental but a trade measure, there is a controversy over its consistency with WTO law. This would not be the first instance where the EU's environmental ambition has set off international trade disputes, as have been witnessed in WTO disputes such as EU and Certain Member States - Palm Oil (Malaysia)(DS600) and EU - Palm Oil (Indonesia)(DS593), and also in the EU’s previous attempt to incorporate international aviation into the EU ETS.

Specifically, this study estimates the economic costs of carbon emissions from waste and conceptualizes how revenues generated from carbon pricing can be rechanneled to support carbon reduction efforts in HEIs. By this approach, HEIs not only create incentives for campus users such as students and employees to choose cleaner options but also be able to understand their own carbon footprint and adjust strategy accordingly. While carbon pricing has long been regarded as an alternative approach to tackle carbon pollution, it has not been much discussed in the area of waste management. In this regard, this study attempted to fill this research gap by finding emission reduction potentials in waste management using carbon pricing as a mechanism.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

The effect of carbon pricing on economic outcomes as well as mitigating factors has been studied extensively since the early 1990s. One mitigating factor that has received less attention is education quality. If technological change that reduces the reliance of production on emissions is skill-biased, then carbon pricing may increase the skill premium of earnings and subsequent wage inequality; however, a more elastic skill supply through better education quality may mitigate adverse economic outcomes, including wage inequality, and enhance the effect of carbon pricing on technological change and subsequently emissions. A general equilibrium, overlapping-generations model is proposed, with endogenous skill investment in which the average skill level of the workforce can affect the need for emissions in an aggregate production function. This study uses data on industrial emissions linked to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies dataset for European Union countries. The findings show that, within countries, cognitive skills are positively associated with employment in industries that rely less on emissions for production and in industries that, over time, have been able to reduce their reliance on emissions for production. In the estimated general equilibrium model, higher cognitive skills reduce an economy’s reliance on emissions for production. Having higher quality education—defined as the level of cognitive skills attained by workers per unit of cost—increases the elasticity of skill supply and, as a result, mitigates a carbon tax’s economic costs including output loss and wage inequity, and enhances its effect on emissions reduction. The implication is that investments in education quality are needed for better enabling green technological innovation and adaptation and reducing inequality that results from carbon pricing.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This article examines the conventional life cycle cost (LCC), net present value (NPV), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (SOFCEV) powered by Brazilian fuels. The cost reduction potential of the SOFCEV was evaluated, considering the Brazilian productivity of sugarcane and the carbon fixed by these plantations, through the mechanism of carbon credits sale. Sugarcane ethanol and gasoline C (73% gasoline A and 27% anhydrous ethanol) were considered. Three scenarios were outlined: a) Cost of investment, fuel production, and vehicle maintenance and operation in USD/km, over a 10-year amortization period; b) SOFCEV emission cost from well-to-wheel added to cost (a); c) Cost of carbon fixed by hectares of sugarcane in Brazil necessary to supply the fuel demand of the SOFCEV subtracted from (b). Results showed that the ethanol-fuelled SOFCEV attends the carbon-neutral cycle, since the carbon credit sale resulted in an avoided cost 1.1 times higher than the emissions cost. Gasoline C showed similar results for the three scenarios, with an emission cost 2.5 times higher than the avoided cost. Carbon pricing was not sufficient to make the technology more viable for consumer, with an expected NPV of -USD 8006.38 after the amortization period. Thus, it is expected to obtain economic indicators to encourage the use of biofuels in electric fleets.","[""abstract""]"

However, its early development stage makes impact assessment difficult. Moreover, rising popularity in carbon pricing necessitates the development of a methodology for deriving carbon abatement costs that are harmonized with the price of carbon. We develop, using a combined bottom-up analysis and top-down learning curve approach, a levelized cost of carbon abatement (LCCA) model for assessing the true cost of emissions mitigation in CCUS technology under carbon pricing mechanisms. We demonstrate our methodology by adapting three policy scenarios in Canada to explore how the implementation of CO2-to-diesel technologies could economically decarbonize Canada’s transportation sector. With continued policy development, Canada can avoid 932 MtCO2eq by 2075 at an LCCA of CA$209/tCO2eq. Technological learning, low emission hydroelectricity generation, and cost-effective electricity prices make Quebec and Manitoba uniquely positioned to support CO2-to-diesel technology. The additional policy supports beyond 2030, including an escalating carbon price, CO2-derived fuel blending requirements, or investment in low-cost renewable electricity, which can accelerate market diffusion of CO2-to-diesel technology in Canada. This methodology is applicable to different jurisdictions and disruptive technologies, providing ample foci for future work to leverage this combined technology learning + LCCA approach.","[""abstract""]"

Cellulosic biomass in particular is anticipated to be used in increasing quantities because of policy efforts, such as federal renewable fuel standards and state renewable portfolio standards. Unfortunately, these independently designed biomass policies do not account for the fact that cellulosic biomass can equally be used for different, competing energy demands. An integrated assessment of multiple feedstocks, energy demands, and system costs is critical for making optimal decisions about a unified biomass energy strategy. This study develops a spatially explicit, best-use framework to optimally allocate cellulosic biomass feedstocks to energy demands in transportation, electricity, and residential heating sectors, while minimizing total system costs and tracking greenhouse gas emissions. Comparing biomass usage across three climate policy scenarios suggests that biomass used for space heating is a low cost emissions reduction option, while biomass for liquid fuel or for electricity becomes attractive only as emissions reduction targets or carbon prices increase. Regardless of the policy approach, study results make a strong case for national and regional coordination in policy design and compliance pathways.","[""abstract""]"

However, claims about economic and environmental impacts often lack transparency and may be based on incomplete metrics that can obscure differences in policy design. This paper examines model-based metrics used to assess the economic efficiency impacts of prospective electric sector policies. The appropriateness of alternative metrics varies by context, model, audience, and application, depending on the prioritization of comprehensiveness, measurability, transparency, and credible precision. This paper provides guidance for the modeling community on calculating and communicating cost metrics and for consumers of model outputs on interpreting these economic indicators. Using an illustrative example of clean electricity standards in the US power sector, model outputs highlight strengths and limitations of different cost metrics. Transformations of power systems with lower-carbon resources and zero-marginal-cost generation may entail shifts in when and where system costs are incurred, and given how these changes may not be appropriately reflected in metrics that were commonly reported in the past such as wholesale energy prices, showing a decomposition of system costs across standard reporting categories could be a more robust reporting practice. Ultimately, providing better metrics is only one element in a portfolio of transparency-related practices, and although it is insufficient by itself, such reporting can help to move dialogues in more productive directions and encourage better modeling practices.","[""abstract""]"

To ensure the prediction precision, forecasting of the carbon price dynamics exploits not only the historical information of itself but also that of its key predictors, including the price dynamics of fossil energy and stock markets. We find that the Attention mechanism can significantly improve the LSTM prediction of both the price return and volatility of carbon allowances being traded in the European Union (EU) ETS. The superior predictability of the AttLSTM is examined by its lower MSE values in the out-of-sample forecasting against the standard LSTM prediction in various parameter settings and tuning experiments, respectively. Such superior predictions are further demonstrated by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Our results reveal the strong predictive performance of the AttLSTM in the carbon price dynamics, and corresponding implications should be of interest to various stakeholders.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This book offers a philosophical defense of these assumptions in order to overcome the major conceptual barriers to the participation of philosophers in these debates. There are five important barriers: First, the policy debate presupposes a stance of liberal neutrality, as a result of which it does not privilege any particular set of environmental values over other concerns. Second, it assumes ongoing economic growth, along with a commitment to what is sometimes called a weak sustainability framework when analyzing the value of the bequest being made to future generations. Third, it treats climate change as fundamentally a collective action problem, not an issue of distributive justice. Fourth, there is the acceptance of cost-benefit analysis, or more precisely, the view that a carbon-pricing regime should be guided by our best estimate of the social cost of carbon. And finally, there is the view that when this calculation is undertaken, it is permissible to discount costs and benefits, depending on how far removed they are from the present. This book attempts to make explicit and defend these presuppositions, and in so doing offer philosophical foundations for the debate over climate change policy.","[""abstract""]"

More than 120 countries have already announced plans to achieve net-zero emissions by the middle of the century. Among them are Russia’s largest trading partners, including the European Union, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Kazakhstan, as well as the United States. These ambitions are supported by a tightening carbon regulation: carbon pricing has already been set up in 64 countries and regions. In the largest emissions trading system – the European one – carbon price has already exceeded 50 euros per ton of emissions.

Significant effort in decarbonization has been taken in many industries (e.g., civil aviation, maritime transport, oil and gas industry), companies (which set up carbon neutrality targets and introduce internal carbon pricing) and the financial sector. Standards for corporate information disclosure about emissions and strategies for their reduction, in particular CDP and TCFD, are being developed and adopted. At the same time, ways to put pressure on competitors who do not want to bear the costs associated with reducing greenhouse gas emissions are being developed. For example, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) will be launched by the European Union in 2023. All these trends mean that products with low carbon footprint become not just a competitive advantage for a company, but also an inevitable condition for its presence on the international market. Companies with a high carbon footprint face less favorable conditions of borrowing, as well as trading barriers and growing pressure from customers both corporate and individual.

In this regard, the development of low-carbon economy in Russia is inevitable to minimize the costs associated with tightening regulation. It is becoming particularly relevant for export-oriented regions with large emissions, including the Republic of Tatarstan. In our opinion, the launch of a pilot project to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in this region is important not only for GHG reduction itself, but also for increasing competitiveness of Tatarstan companies on international markets and attracting investment from both Russian and foreign investors. In this paper, we explain the need to launch such a pilot and relying on the existing Russian and international experience on the one hand and taking into account the characteristics of Tatarstan’s economy on the other, we demonstrate a scheme by which such a project can be organized.","[""abstract""]"

 Climate Change is one of the most important threats in the world today and it is driven by the human-induced build-up of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. Despite worldwide policy efforts from the Kyoto Protocol to the Paris Agreement, global emissions of GHG have continued to steadily increase over the past decade. Against this backdrop, many higher education institutions (HEIs) around the world began to engage in sustainable practices implementing green initiatives on their campuses. Using the waste disposal and the associated GHG emissions data from the academic community, this study describes how HEIs can assume a leadership role in climate mitigation through the implementation of a carbon pricing initiative. Specifically, this study estimates the economic costs of carbon emissions from waste and conceptualizes how revenues generated from carbon pricing can be rechanneled to support carbon reduction efforts in HEIs. By this approach, HEIs not only create incentives for campus users such as students and employees to choose cleaner options but also be able to understand their own carbon footprint and adjust strategy accordingly. While carbon pricing has long been regarded as an alternative approach to tackle carbon pollution, it has not been much discussed in the area of waste management. In this regard, this study attempted to fill this research gap by finding emission reduction potentials in waste management using carbon pricing as a mechanism.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Organizations have implemented offshore outsourcing as an effective strategy towards reducing supply chain costs. However, neither government nor corporate organizations have sufficiently taken into account the effects of this strategy on global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 

The purpose of this research is to analyze the impact of offshore outsourcing on global GHG emissions, and the effect of changes in fuel prices in addition to a carbon price on additional emissions on supply chain costs. The purpose is supported by five key objectives. The objectives are addressed through a systematic methodology. The analysis is supported by a literature review, and the development and testing of mathematical models. Finally, a framework to reduce global GHG emissions through a carbon price on differential emissions from manufacturing and additional emissions from international transportation is proposed. 

The findings suggest that offshore outsourcing has increased global emissions. The fuel prices are increasing at a rate 
higher than the overall rate. A carbon price on excess emissions due to outsourcing coupled with increasing fuel prices impacts supply chain costs adversely and leads to bigger lot-sizes. As an illustration at the national level, the framework showed that emissions for the USA increased by about 20% for every year between 2007 and 2010. As another example from a corporate organization, the net profit (profit after tax) for Wal-Mart was reduced by about 19% for 2006 due to a carbon price on manufacturing emissions alone. 

The suggested framework is a major contribution for quantifying the extent of changes in the emissions due to offshore outsourcing and the value of these emissions at a prevailing rate of carbon tax in North America. It is intended to provide a basis for reducing emissions and costs from global supply chains. The proposed framework provides a level playing field to manufacturers in different countries using different technologies, provides incentives to organizations for manufacturing in locations where net emissions are low, helps national governments determine how they can generate revenue for dealing with emissions, and, most importantly, aids in reducing overall global GHG emissions.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This paper studies the reasoning behind such policy mixes and the economic interaction effects that result from these different policy instruments. We model these interactions using an intertemporal model, related to Sachs (2015), which proposes a burden sharing between current and future generations. The issuance of green bonds helps to enable immediate investment in climate change mitigation and adaptation, and the bonds would be repaid by future generations in such a way that those who benefit from reduced future environmental damage share in the burden of financing mitigation efforts undertaken today. We examine the effects of combining green bonds and carbon pricing in a three-phase model. We are using a numerical solution procedure which allows for finite-horizon solutions and phase changes. We show that green bonds perform better when they are combined with carbon pricing. Our proposed policy option appears to be politically more feasible than a green transition based only on carbon pricing and is more prudent for debt sustainability than a green transition that relies overly on green bonds.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

The results support the inverted U-shaped relationship between carbon emissions and global income with a turning point of US$15,800 and US$11,100 by using FMOLS and DOLS estimators respectively. The ex-ante analysis shows that knowledge spillover, trademark applications, and carbon pricing will largely decrease carbon emissions while carbon pricing, food production index, FDI inflows, and broad money supply will decrease fossil fuel emissions for the next 10 years time period.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

First, we describe current climate-related policies in Iran and survey relevant academic literature on their effectiveness. We then review carbon pricing designs in five countries with a comparable development status to Iran. Finally, we consider whether Iran’s current climate policies are adequate and what role carbon pricing could play in a future climate policy mix. The results of this study should enhance an understanding of Iran’s climate policy, which thus far has received little attention in research;and can be put to immediate use in shaping a sustainable climate policy strategy for Iran.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

As growth in travel demand continues to outstrip improvements in the fuel efficiency of air travel, the aviation contribution to climate change is likely to grow substantially. Consequently, measures that effectively reduce travel demand are required if atmospheric carbon concentrations are to be limited. The efficacy of the Australian Clean Energy Future policy which placed a $23.00AUD (FY 2012) to $24.15 AUD (FY 2013) per tonne levy on carbon-dioxide equivalent emissions from July 2012 to June 2014 is tested. Specifically, time-series regression is used to estimate the effect of this carbon price policy on the level of domestic passenger kilometres flown in Australia, while adjusting for costs of production (i.e. fuel and labour costs), economic activity (i.e. gross domestic product), competitive effects (i.e. airline capacity), and exogenous shocks. There was no evidence that the carbon price reduced the level of domestic aviation in Australia. Carbon pricing measures may have to be levied at a greater rate to affect behavioural change, particularly given the limited potential for future aviation efficiency gains.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This work seeks to identify market barriers and supports for the adoption of renewable energy. A framework to represent the evaluation process for generating capacity is proposed and applied to two regions: California (CAISO), where legislation requires most electricity to be supplied by renewables by 2030, and the Mid-Atlantic (PJM), where renewables have barely penetrated the market. Generation technologies are ordered via multiobjective optimization using genetic algorithms to resolve a bounded knapsack problem. Price factors for each technology are established. A net present value is assessed for representative projects in each region and technology. Local sensitivity analysis is performed. Results suggest that capacity payments in PJM offer an incentive to fossil-fuel based plants, which calls into question the suitability of carbon pricing in the region. While solar PV has the lowest costs, profitability was highest for natural gas based plants in PJM. Sensitivity is higher in CAISO than in PJM due to lower profit margins. Renewables were selected most frequently in the cost optimization, with natural gas present in ~10% of results.","[""abstract""]"

This paper shows the substantial variation in the price responsiveness of emissions across sectors and thus prices implied by sectoral targets. It proposes the following measures to help Germany meet emissions targets with greater certainty and cost effectiveness: (i) further strengthening carbon pricing, for example through automatically rising price floors for the national ETS after 2026; (ii) harmonizing carbon pricing to reduce cross-sector differences in marginal abatement costs; and (iii) introducing feebates (revenue neutral taxsubsidy schemes) to reinforce incentives at the sectoral level. The paper also studies the distributional impact of higher carbon pricing and suggests that reducing social security contributions can mitigate the regressive direct impact of higher carbon pricing on lowerincome households.

However, little is known about their interplay in the context of climate stabilization. Here, we present the first multi-model assessment quantifying the effectiveness of supply-side policies and their interactions with demand-side ones. We design narratives of fossil fuel bans and explore a variety of scenarios with four process-based integrated assessment models. We find that supply side treaties reduce emissions but not enough to stabilize temperature increase to well below 2°C. When combined with demand-side policies, supply side policies reduce the required carbon price to meet the Paris goals, dampen reliance on CO2 removal and increase investment in renewable energy while increasing fossil producer revenues. The results indicate the opportunity to integrate price-based policies with fossil bans when exploring climate neutrality pathways.","[""abstract""]"

The article assesses the potential impacts of Poland’s climate neutrality achievement path on the domestic farm sector in terms of its structure, output, income, and prices of agricultural products. The approach is based on complex economic modelling combining computable general equilibrium (CGE) and optimisation modelling, with the farm sector model consisting of farm, structural, and market modules. While the modelling results cover three GHG emission-reduction scenarios up to 2050, to understand the transformation impact within varying policy approaches, the study for each scenario of farm sector development also outlines three policy options: carbon pricing, forced emission limit, and carbon subsidies. Results in all scenarios and policy options indicate a strong foreseeable impact on agricultural output and prices (mainly livestock production), shifts in the production structure toward crops, as well as changes in farm income along the analysed timeframe.","[""abstract""]"

Brazil's NDC target aims to reduce economy-wide absolute levels of GHG emissions by 37% in 2025 and 43% in 2030, compared to 2005 emissions. In this paper, we compare command-and-control and carbon pricing policies to induce the Brazilian economy to meet its NDC targets. We focus on analysing synergies and trade-offs in macroeconomic and social development, captured by economic growth and income distribution while reducing GHG emissions. By integrating a series of sectoral models and a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, we develop and run different policy scenarios that simulate a set of carbon pricing schemes in Brazil. Our analysis shows that NDC implementation in Brazil under carbon pricing policies allows the country to meet its targets and improve economic and social indicators compared to a command-and-control policy. With about the same GHG emissions up to 2030, important macroeconomic and social co-benefits can be achieved under a carbon pricing policy in Brazil, allowing for reduced welfare losses against business-as-usual trends. Key policy insights: Carbon pricing policies are more cost-effective to meet NDC targets in Brazil up to 2030, resulting in higher GDP and household income, in comparison to other individual policy instruments, including command-and-control and subsidies to investments. A carbon price of about 10 USD/tCO2e, combined importantly with deforestation rates under control, would allow Brazil to meet its NDC targets. Recycling carbon pricing revenues can help soften the burden on the labour market and protect low-income households from welfare losses.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

 The application of alternative fuels in automobile engines is gaining more popularity among the scientific community than ever. Most of the research emphasis is on the performance and combustion aspect of the engine. The environmental and economic evaluation of these fuels is also equally important for sustainability, which is relatively unexplored and needs to be evaluated. The present work compares the environmental and economic aspects of a spark ignition (SI) engine fueled with gasoline and compressed natural gas (CNG). To study the environmental impact, regulated and unregulated emissions coming out from the engine exhaust were compared. For economic assessment, annual fuel consumption and associated fuel cost were compared under similar engine operating conditions. The economic cost associated with the environmental impact was calculated based on carbon dioxide emissions and compared using carbon pricing. Experiments on an SI engine were performed at various engine loads to achieve a range of operating conditions to evaluate fuel consumption and engine-out emissions. Results show that a CNG fueled engine has 12.7% lower brake specific fuel consumption than the gasoline engine, which leads to 56% lower fuel cost. It is due to the cumulative effect of higher calorific value and the lower fuel price of CNG compared to gasoline. Additionally, average environment emission and associated cost due to carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduced by 29% using CNG over gasoline. This study shows that CNG can lead to lesser fuel consumption and its associated fuel and environment cost compared to gasoline.","[""abstract""]"

Many studies were conducted and initiatives were proposed as mitigation and adaptation strategies to date, such as restoration and preservation of carbon storage. Peatlands are widely recognized as the largest natural carbon storage of all terrestrial ecosystems. Peatlands can help mitigate climate change by its ability to sequestrate huge amounts of carbon and maintain water balance. This valuable yet vulnerable ecosystem needs to be managed properly to maintain the functions. This study aimed to critically review the peatland conservation strategies and possibility of carbon pricing for mitigation and adaptation of climate change, specifically for Indonesia. It was revealed that restoration strategies such as rewetting, revegetation, and revitalization could help with peatlands conservation and further reduction in emissions from land sectors. However, the funding for conservation activities would become a hindrance to the viability and sustainability. Carbon pricing could be a potentially effective approach to conservation of peatlands. Sequestrated carbon and potential additional value from ecosystem services could higher up the price that made the option for conservation more stunning. Therefore, to establish tradable carbon credits on peatland as a means to support the sustainability of Indonesia’s peatland conservation in the future, the action to well managing and standardizing the carbon credits should be started immediately. Though the process will take time and great willingness from all parties, this option could be used for long-term peatland conservation activities.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

The steepest slopes have the lowest pasture productivity and livestock carrying capacity and are the most vulnerable to soil mass movements. A potential management option for these areas of a farm is the planting of native shrubs which are browsable and provide erosion control, biodiversity, and a source of carbon credits. A bioeconomic whole farm model was developed by adding a native shrub sub-model to an existing hill country sheep and beef enterprise model to assess the impacts on feed supply, flock dynamics, and farm economics of converting 10% (56.4 hectares) of the entire farm, focusing on the steep slope areas, to native shrubs over a 50-year period. Two native shrub planting rates of 10% and 20% per year of the allocated area were compared to the status quo of no (0%) native shrub plantings. Mean annual feed supply dropped by 6.6% and 7.1% causing a reduction in flock size by 10.9% and 11.6% for the 10% and 20% planting rates, respectively, relative to 0% native shrub over the 50 years. Native shrub expenses exceeded carbon income for both planting rates and, together with reduced income from sheep flock, resulted in lower mean annual discounted total sheep enterprise cash operating surplus for the 10% (New Zealand Dollar (NZD) 20,522) and 20% (NZD 19,532) planting scenarios compared to 0% native shrubs (NZD 22,270). All planting scenarios had positive Net Present Value (NPV) and was highest for the 0% native shrubs compared to planting rates. Break-even carbon price was higher than the modelled carbon price (NZD 32/ New Zealand Emission Unit (NZU)) for both planting rates. Combined, this data indicates planting native shrubs on 10% of the farm at the modelled planting rates and carbon price would result in a reduction in farm sheep enterprise income. It can be concluded from the study that a higher carbon price above the break-even can make native shrubs attractive in the farming system.","[""abstract""]"

Estimate the energy savings potential achievable by optimizing internal steam management and optimizing steam export/import; 2. Quantify the associated change in air pollutant emissions; 3. Analyze the impact of the increasing carbon price on the measures adopted. Internal steam management optimization yielded steam let-down rate minimization and resulted in a 5% (87 TJ/year) reduction in steam cracker’s steam boiler fuel consumption and the associated cut of CO2 emissions by almost 4900 t/year and that of NOx emissions by more than 5 t/year. Steam import to the ethylene plant from the refinery proved to be purely economic-driven, as it increased the net fuel consumption of the ethylene plant and the refinery complex by 12 TJ/year and resulted in an increase of net emissions of nearly all considered air pollutants (more than 7000 t/year of CO2, over 15 t/year of NOx, over 18 t/year of SOx) except for CO, where the net change was almost zero. The effect of external emissions change due to the associated backpressure electricity production surplus (over 11 GWh/year) was too low to compensate for this increase unless fossil fuel-based electricity production was considered. The increase of carbon price impact on the internal steam management optimization economics was favorable, while a switch to steam export from the ethylene plant, instead of steam import, might be feasible if the carbon price increased to over 100 €/tCO2.","[""abstract""]"

Moreover, the initial carbon price is heavily influenced by restrictions on net-negative emissions and the pathway by both restrictions on net-negative emissions and socio-economic inertia. This means that Hotelling pathways are not necessarily optimal: in fact, combining learning by doing and the above restrictions leads to initial carbon prices that are more than twice as high as a Hotelling pathway and thus to much earlier emission reductions. The optimal price path also increases less strongly and may even decline later in the century, leading to higher initial abatement costs but much lower long-term costs.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This reduces overall welfare costs of limiting global warming and the associated damages. In this paper, we take a public economics perspective and derive optimal subsidies for carbon dioxide removal. We first show that in a first-best setting with the climate externality as only market failure, subsidies for CDR equal the carbon tax, implying a common carbon price for positive and negative emissions. We then investigate various setting where optimal CDR subsidies are different than carbon taxes. (i) Under a distortive tax system, optimal subsidies for CDR differ from optimal carbon taxes because CDR requires costly public funds. (ii) If no global carbon price exists but a national government implements a unilateral climate policy, optimal CDR subsidies are always higher than carbon taxes as the latter is prone to mitigation induced carbon leakage. Nevertheless, also optimal CDR subsidies are set below marginal environmental benefits because of a newly established removal leakage channel as reduced climate damages abroad increase fossil fuel demand. (iii) If geological storage sites are an open-access resource with inefficient dynamic allocation, optimal CDR subsidies are also lower than optimal carbon taxes. *Corresponding author. kalkuhl@mcc-berlin.net","[""abstract"",""title""]"

However, the spatial responses of soil organic carbon (SOC) to biochar addition in cropland are still uncertain, and the economic feasibility of large‐scale biochar implementation remains unclear. Here, we analyzed the response of SOC to biochar addition using 389 paired field measurements. The results show that biochar addition significantly increased SOC by 45.8% on average with large regional variations. Using a random forest model trained with soil, climate, biotic, biochar, and management factors, we found that the response of SOC to biochar addition was mainly dependent on biochar application rates, initial SOC, edaphic (e.g., pH), and climatic (e.g., mean annual precipitation) variables. Combined with the predicted SOC changes to biochar addition on the global cropland, we assessed the revenue of the biochar system based on the current and potential pyrolysis plants in the world using the life‐cycle analysis. Net revenue of the currently existing 144 pyrolysis plants increases with larger plant capacity and higher carbon price. Potential revenue of building new plants is high in regions like America and Europe but low in regions with infertile soil, low crop residues availability, and inconvenient transportation. The global CO2 removal of biochar application is 6.6 Tg CO2e (CO2 equivalent) year−1 with a net revenue of $ 177 million dollars at a carbon price of $ 50 t−1 CO2 for current pyrolysis plants with a biomass‐processing capacity of 20,000 t year−1. Our study provides a full economic assessment of idealized biochar addition scenarios and identifies the locations with maximal potential revenues with new pyrolysis plants.","[""abstract""]"

Between 1990 and 2017, New Zealand’s gross greenhouse gas emissions increased by 23.1% while emissions from the road transport sector increased by 82%; rising to 15.9 MtCO2e in 2017 from about 8.8 MtCO2e in 1990. To reduce transport emissions, the government has undertaken various initiatives including electric vehicle support, introduction of an emissions trading scheme (ETS), promotion of biofuel and other alternative fuels, and announcement of a feebate scheme. However, even though some of these policies require time to take effect, it is evident from the increase in emissions that there has so far been little progress in terms of transport emissions reduction. This raises questions over the acceptability and effectiveness of the policies taken by the government.  Given the pressing need to reduce transport emissions globally and in New Zealand in particular, the present study initially investigates the major drivers of transport emissions from among a set of likely drivers, using a causality test. Because electric vehicles are widely seen as an obvious ‘solution’ within the sector, this study next examines the costs and mitigation potential of electric vehicles in the New Zealand context in order to understand the uncertainties, risks, barriers, costs, and policy gaps associated with their widespread adoption. Next, this study examines the scope for an increased carbon price signal to curb emissions growth. Finally, this study takes the view that technological and price instruments have to be seen within a wider range of possible transport policy measures, some of which may be complementary. The study therefore elicited the perspectives of a number of transport experts, and NGO and green energy activists. It ranked six mitigation policy pathways and 26 policy options on the basis of experts’, and NGO and green energy activists’ preferences.   Findings of this study include that poor vehicle fuel economy is the major driver of transport emissions in New Zealand. Policies such as a high minimum vehicle fuel economy standard and/or feebate scheme could effectively help New Zealand reduce its transport emissions significantly. Electric vehicles (EVs) are also found to be potentially very effective in reducing emissions as around 80-85% of New Zealand’s electricity comes from renewable generation. Moreover, in terms of the ownership costs of using EVs, used EVs are now the most cost competitive among various vehicle types such as new EVs, used internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs) and new ICEVs. An increase in the carbon price to around NZD 235 per tonne of carbon dioxide (tCO2) is also likely to help the transport sector reduce its emissions by 11% from the 1990 level and achieve the Paris target. However, according to experts’, and NGO and green energy activists’ preferences, EV support and an increased carbon price are not the most preferred emissions reduction options. Some experts, and NGO and green energy activists viewed EV subsidization, EV free parking and EV access to high occupancy lanes as unethical because EVs are mostly used by high-income people whereas low-income people often use bus or low-cost used cars. Likewise, some experts, and NGO and green energy activists did not prefer an increased carbon price because the impact of such a policy would be uneven, and low-income people would be hurt severely compared to high-income people. Results demonstrate that active and public transport support and travel demand management are the most preferred options. Since New Zealand roads are not wide enough to support a high level of individual car use both in the short and the long run, most experts, and NGO and green energy activists preferred active and public transport under current and future circumstances. Policies related to bio-fuel support were least preferred because most experts, and NGO and green energy activists think an increased production and use of biofuels is likely to replace existing forestry and farm activity and decrease food production and forestry. It is hoped that the findings of this study will help to better illuminate the difficult policy options facing policy makers and work to assist them in identifying the most acceptable policies and projects for investment.","[""abstract""]"

Here we model the effects of demand-side restrictions on high-deforestation palm oil in Europe on deforestation and emissions in Indonesia. We do so by integrating a model of global trade with a spatially explicit model of land-use change in Indonesia. We estimate a European ban on high-deforestation palm oil from 2000 to 2015 would have led to a 8.9% global price premium on low-deforestation palm oil, resulting in 21 374 ha yr−1 (1.60%) less deforestation and 21.1 million tCO2 yr−1 (1.91%) less emissions from deforestation in Indonesia relative to what occurred. A hypothetical Indonesia-wide carbon price would have achieved equivalent emission reductions at $0.81/tCO2. Impacts of a ban are small because: 52% of Europe’s imports of high-deforestation palm oil would have shifted to non-participating countries; the price elasticity of supply of high-deforestation oil palm cropland is small (0.13); and conversion to oil palm was responsible for only 32% of deforestation in Indonesia. If demand-side restrictions succeed in substantially reducing deforestation, it is likely to be through non-price pathways.","[""abstract""]"

 on energy price and consumer price index fluctuation, so as to analyze the social and economic development of carbon emissions trading under international oil price fluctuation. The results show that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship between international oil price and carbon price,
 and the spillover of international oil price to carbon market and yield shows that oil price can lead to the change of carbon price, but because of the change of EU energy consumption structure and the continuous improvement of carbon trading mechanism, the spillover effect shows a downward

The heterogeneity is characterised by the hurdle rates the agents employ (to manage risk) and by their expectations of the future carbon prices. We analyse the impact of the heterogeneity on the transition to a low carbon electricity system. Results show that under an increasing CO2 tax scenario, the agents start investing heavily in wind, followed by nuclear and to some extent in natural gas fired power plants both with and without carbon capture and storage as well as biogas fired power plants. However, the degree to which different technologies are used depend strongly on the carbon tax expectations and the hurdle rate employed by the agents. Comparing to the case with homogeneous agents, the introduction of heterogeneity among the agents leads to a faster CO2 reduction. We also estimate the so called “cannibalisation effect” for wind and find that the absolute value of wind does not drop in response to higher deployment levels, but the relative value does decline.","[""abstract""]"

Purpose
Lignite coal-fired power plants are the main electricity generators in the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Although burning lignite coal to generate power is economical, it produces significant greenhouse gases making it a big challenge to Canada’s international commitment on emission reduction. However, abundant agricultural crops and sawdust produced in Saskatchewan put the province in a good position to produce and use agri-pellets as an alternative fuel to generate electricity. This study aims to conduct an economic and environmental analysis of the replacement of lignite coal by agri-pellets as the fuel for Saskatchewan’s coal-fired power plants.


Design/methodology/approach
The study estimates the economic and environmental costs and benefits of two alternative fuels for power plants. The economic analysis is based on the pellet production and transportation costs from farms to production sites and from the production sites to power plants. In the production process, biomass precursors are densified with and without additives to produce fuel agri-pellets with appropriate mechanical durability and high heating value per volume unit. The environmental analysis involves estimation of greenhouse gas emissions and their social costs for lignite coal and different types of agri-pellets under different scenarios for pellet production and transportation.


Findings
The results show that although the total cost of electricity is lower for coal than agri-pellets, the gap shrinks when social costs and specifically a carbon price of $50/tonne are included in the model. The cost of electricity in lignite coal-fired power plants would also be on par with agri-pellets-fired power plants if the carbon price is between U$68 and $78 per tonne depending on the power plant locations. Therefore, a transition from coal to agri-pellet fuels is feasible if a high-enough price is assigned to carbon. The method and the results can be generalized to other places with similar conditions.


Research limitations/implications
There are a few caveats in this study as follows. First, the fixed costs associated with the transformation of the existing coal-fired power plants to pellet-fired plants are not considered. Second, the technological progress in the transportation sector, which would favor the net benefits of using pellets versus coal, is not included in the analysis. Finally, the study does not address the possible political challenges facing the transition in the context of the Canadian federal system.


Practical implications
The study results indicate that the current carbon price of $50 per tonne is not sufficient to make the agri-pellets a feasible source of alternative energy in Saskatchewan. However, if carbon pricing continues to rise by $15 annually starting in 2022, as announced, a transition from coal to agri-pellets will be economically feasible.


Social implications
Canada is committed to reduce its emission according to the Paris agreement, and therefore, needs to have a concrete policy to find alternative energy sources for its coal-fired power plants. This study examines the challenges and benefits of such transition using the existing agri-pellet resources in Saskatchewan, a province with abundant agricultural residues and coal-fired power plants. The findings indicate that a significant emission reduction can be achieved by using agri-pellets instead of coal to produce electricity. The study also implies that the transition to renewable energy is economical when social costs of carbon (carbon tax) is included in the analysis.


Originality/value
As far as the authors know, this is the first study providing a socio-economic analysis for a possible transition from the coal-fired power plants to a more clean and sustainable renewable energy source in one of the highest carbon dioxide (CO2) producer provinces in Canada: Saskatchewan. The study builds upon the technical production of three agri-pellets (oat hull, canola hull and sawdust) and estimates the economic and environmental costs of alternative fuels under different scenarios.

Results illustrate that at current trading prices for carbon credits and market prices of woodchips, expected rates of return on investment for SRWC were relatively low, despite a positive net present value ($400/ha for 20 year planting cycle without carbon credits). However, estimates from the Ellerslie site indicate that 330 tons of CO2-eq per hectare are captured above and below ground over the 20 year plantation cycle.

Comprehensive carbon prices build upon previous notions—including explicit, effective, and implicit carbon prices—by incorporating a broad range of policies that reduce carbon emissions. We consider seven types of major market-based policies commonly used to create marginal incentives to reduce emissions: carbon taxes, emissions trading systems, fossil fuel taxes, fossil fuel subsidies, renewable portfolio standards, feed-in tariffs, and low-carbon fuel standards. Comprehensive carbon prices represent the weighted average of marginal incentives imposed on polluters by country policy mixes. We measure country-level comprehensive carbon prices by summing across all seven policies the product of (1) the marginal incentive imposed by a policy (expressed in dollars per ton of CO2 emitted), and (2) a CO2-emissions-coverage weight for that policy (equal to the proportion of CO2 emissions regulated by the policy relative to that country’s total CO2 emissions). We measure the global comprehensive carbon price by summing across all 25 countries the product of (1) each country’s comprehensive carbon price, and (2) that country’s proportion of CO2 emissions relative to total CO2 emissions from our sample of 25 countries. The global comprehensive carbon price has risen upward from +8.68 USD in 2008 to +19.13 USD in 2019, with a dip to +6.94 USD per ton in 2012. These values are far too low to appropriately address climate change. The comprehensive carbon price varies widely between countries, ranging from −128.35 USD to +146.25 USD in 2019. This heterogeneity means that polluters face uneven marginal incentives to reduce CO2 emissions. Our focus is on measuring marginal incentives rather than policy outcomes, such as overall emissions abatement, which we identify as a promising area for future research. KEY POLICY INSIGHTS Comprehensive carbon prices represent a useful metric for summarizing and tracking global and country-level efforts to mitigate carbon emissions through public policy. Comprehensive carbon prices report a dollar per ton of carbon dioxide emissions imposed by a wide range of climate policies including carbon taxes, emissions trading systems, fossil fuel subsidies and taxes, renewable portfolio standards, feed-in tariffs, and low-carbon fuel standards. Country-level comprehensive carbon prices vary widely, from −128.35 to +146.25 USD in 2019, reflecting wide heterogeneity in the overall effort countries are putting into climate mitigation. The global comprehensive carbon price has approximately doubled over the last decade, reaching a value of +19.13 USD in 2019, and remains too low to seriously address climate change.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

We analyze the incentives created by two novel forms of rebating that reward additional emission intensity reductions: one given in proportion to output (intensity-based output rebating, IBOR) and another that rebates a share of emissions payments made (intensity-based emissions rebating, IBER). We contrast them with more common approaches like output-based rebating (OBR), abatement-based rebating (ABR), or lump-sum rebating (LSR). Comparing revenue-neutral schemes, given the same emissions price, IBOR incentivizes the most intensity reductions, while ABR incentivizes the most output reductions, and OBR puts the least pressure on output (and emissions); IBER lies in between by implicitly subsidizing emissions while incentivizing intensity reductions. We supplement partial equilibrium theoretical analysis with numerical simulations to assess the performance of different mechanisms in a multisector general equilibrium model that accounts for economy-wide market interactions and accommodates the trade-off analysis between overall economic efficiency and sectoral performance indicators such as output or emission intensity. ∗This research was undertaken, in part, thanks to funding from the Canada 150 Research Chairs Program.

 To implement the European Union (EU) Climate Law’s newly established 55% greenhouse gas reduction objective for 2030, the EU Commission suggests a wave of reforms to the European energy and climate legislation. The contribution aims to describe the EU Commission’s 16 initial legislative and strategic proposals regarding the major pillars of the European energy and climate legislation and intends to give an overview on the suggested reforms. By comparing the legal status quo with the legal framework de lege ferenda as presented by the Commission’s proposals, the planned major changes to the legal structures are identified. To achieve the 55% greenhouse gas reduction objective for 2030, all existing legal climate and energy acts are planned to be tightened by amending their targets as well as scopes and revising their structures. The suggested reforms concern the existing EU emissions trading system, effort sharing system between the Member States, energy taxation, energy efficiency and renewable energies. Additionally, the implementation of new instruments, such as the second EU emissions trading system for the sectors buildings and transport, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism and the Social Climate Fund, is proposed. The design of the package shows that the Commission still generally pursues a climate legislation characterized by a mix of instruments and policies being both price based and regulatory. So, even though the major proposed change—the introduction of a second separate emissions trading system—would strengthen the role of carbon pricing, the Commission still relies on a mix of instruments without defining a leading instrument.","[""abstract""]"

However, the extent to which payments are actually based on results is unknown, necessitating program evaluations to establish the contribution of REDD+ to the Paris NDCs. We undertake a microeconometric evaluation of one of the most globally significant REDD+ initiatives, Indonesia’s moratorium on forest concessions, in which a payment has been awarded. At the agreed US$5/tCO2-eq, the value of our estimated cumulative carbon emissions far exceeds the proposed payment from the donor, Norway. Although cost-effective, the emissions reductions only contribute 3 to 4% of Indonesia’s NDC. This contribution could be increased in new initiatives with better-designed incentives and institutional arrangements. International initiatives for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) could make critical, cost-effective contributions to tropical countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Norway, a key donor of such initiatives, had a REDD+ partnership with Indonesia, offering results-based payments in exchange for emissions reductions calculated against a historical baseline. Central to this partnership was an area-based moratorium on new oil palm, timber, and logging concessions in primary and peatland forests. We evaluate the effectiveness of the moratorium between 2011 and 2018 by applying a matched triple difference strategy to a unique panel dataset. Treated dryland forest inside moratorium areas retained, at most, an average of 0.65% higher forest cover compared to untreated dryland forest outside the moratorium. By contrast, carbon-rich peatland forest was unaffected by the moratorium. Cumulative avoided dryland deforestation from 2011 until 2018 translates into 67.8 million to 86.9 million tons of emissions reductions, implying an effective carbon price below Norway’s US$5 per ton price. Based on Norway’s price, our estimated cumulative emissions reductions are equivalent to a payment of US$339 million to US$434.5 million. Annually, our estimates suggest a 3 to 4% contribution to Indonesia’s NDC commitment of a 29% emissions reduction by 2030. Despite the Indonesia–Norway partnership ending in 2021, reducing emissions from deforestation remains critical for meeting this commitment. Future area-based REDD+ initiatives could build on the moratorium’s outcomes by reforming its incentives and institutional arrangements, particularly in peatland forest areas.","[""abstract""]"

A vendor supplies products under a vendor-managed inventory; hence, it is responsible for the logistics activities. The effect of product deterioration and quality problems are also considered, in which the vendor performs a 100% quality inspection. A carbon price is imposed on total emissions from production and logistics activities under a cap-and-trade regulation. The result is inventory decisions regarding the optimal delivery quantity as well as the delivery frequencies that minimize the total costs. The reduction in total carbon emissions from the decisions was also studied.","[""abstract""]"

 The literature on carbon pricing offers competing explanations for the introduction of carbon taxation. This article contributes to the field by highlighting the interaction of dynamic political factors and external pressures in explaining the timing of the adoption of carbon taxes. Focusing on the second wave of European countries, the study combines the multiple streams framework with qualitative comparative analysis to identify conditions favourable to the introduction of carbon taxes. Additional case studies on Ireland and Portugal serve to illuminate the reform process, especially the role of policy entrepreneurs. This approach yields three insights. First, fiscal crises provide political actors with an opportunity to raise environmental taxes. Second, the introduction of carbon taxation is most likely when push and pull factors come together, i.e. when high problem pressure coincides with governments receptive to environmental issues. Finally, the prospects of “green” policy entrepreneurs are strongly determined by their standing within the government.","[""abstract""]"

This paper elaborates on the administration’s plans and uses two models developed at the IMF to illustrate key macro-climate trade-offs. First, a model with endogenous fuel-specific technological change shows that subsidies cannot substitute for explicit carbon pricing and that even a moderate carbon tax can greatly economize on the overall fiscal cost of the package. Second, a rich sectoral model shows that there are only very marginal economic costs from front-loading the decarbonization of the power sector but there are large accompanying environmental benefits. Regulations can be effective in the power sector because they provide an appropriate shadow cost to carbon. However, a carbon tax would still be more ef f icient and easier to administer. Finally, as the economy transitions away from fossil-fueled power generation, there would be a significant reallocation of labor across sectors and locations that would need to be handled carefully to limit the social costs of the transition.

Financial incentives, behavioral interventions, and mandates can drive technology adoption, while land-use zoning policies provide the framework for development of the built environment. Often policies and their impacts are evaluated top down, typically on a national scale, or post-hoc on developments vis-à-vis different policies in the past. Such high-level analyses and post-hoc evaluations cannot show possible developments pathways for specific cities, and hence cannot serve as input to policymakers at the local level such as county, municipal, or city governments. Here, we present IMPACT pathways from a bottom-up model with residence level granularity that integrate policy for technology adoption with zoning policy, climate change, and grid decarbonization scenarios. With the city at the heart of the analysis, our results show potential greenhouse gas emission pathways, identify synergies and trade-offs between policies, and show the importance of appropriate baselines. BACKGROUND & RATIONALE Buildings account for ~40% of the global energy consumption and ~30% of the associated greenhouse gas emissions, while also offering a 50–90% CO2 mitigation potential 1–3. Growing urbanization puts pressure on cities in order to absorb increasing populations, requiring decisions on land-use 4,5. While it is generally acknowledged that urban infill development is beneficial compared to outward expansion in terms of economics and carbon emissions 6–9, quantifying these benefits under various external factors, e.g., climate change, is challenging 10. Integration of urban strategies for mitigation and adaptation to climate change is needed to avoid carbon lock-in effects11,12 and to identify potential synergies and reduce suboptimal trade-offs between mitigation responses. As such, if policies put in place to drive these improvements are to be effective, they should be designed by anticipating the integrated landscape of infrastructure, climate, and behavioral conditions and responses. End-use electrification in combination with electric grid decarbonization and higher energy efficiency is considered to be the major pathway toward decarbonization of the built environment13. Since energy demand in buildings is mostly dominated by HVAC equipment, one promising policy lever is the provision of financial incentives for higher-efficiency system upgrades or solar photovoltaic (PV) installations14. Mandates are used in building codes to require that certain minimum efficiency standards or technologies (e.g., solar PV) are met in buildings at the time of building or after major renovations. It is debated whether individual, i.e., bottom-up, action or system-level, i.e., top-down, action is more important and should receive greater focus in decarbonization efforts14–16. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, however, this is a false dichotomy as both perspectives must be used in conjunction to effect necessary change17. The challenges with developing a federal-level coordinated climate policy in the U.S. has no doubt increased focus on state, local, and individual action, but it is unclear how those lower-level actions aggregate to measurable differences in energy use in the urban built environment. Modeling and integrating individual decision-making within the context of changing landuse has become critical to understanding what outcomes we can expect based on undirected individual choice versus those that will require incentives or even mandates to generate the aggregated benefits needed for rapid decarbonization. Often policies and their impact are evaluated top down, on a national scale, or post-hoc on developments vis-à-vis different policies in the past4,15,18,19. Global-scale emission pathway studies typically focus on target warming temperatures and backcast how they can be achieved20. Forward projection of emissions and mitigation efforts have been only been explored recently in a few studies, considering carbon pricing as a policy mechanism for relatively short target years, e.g., 203021 or integration with economic models22. Forward projections are useful because they can provide realistic estimates of emission reductions under certain given conditions. As a consequence, forward projection can inform what range of emission reductions can be achieved realistically, which in turn could be linked to target warming temperatures. Here we emphasize that despite cities’ position at the forefront for implementation of climate impact mitigation strategies5, there are no tools available for them to project expected emissions for given policies into the future. Put differently, if city-level forward projections could be done systematically and robustly, would the aggregate of those projections match top-down national/global emissions and warming projections under the same policy scenarios? Unfortunately, we do not know if that will actually be the case and how wide the resulting differences will be. To address this gap, we introduce IMPACT: Integrated Multi-domain emission PAthways for CiTies, a bottom-up spatiotemporal model for the evolution and composition of neighborhoods (see Figure 1a). Our model starts at the parcel level. Each parcel can contain one or more buildings with multiple individual residence units whose type for each decade is governed by zoning policy and redevelopment schedule in the specific neighborhood (see Figure 1b, Figure 2 and Methods: Future Land-use and Transformation Scenarios), and whose energy demand is calculated according to its type, decade, and climate change scenario (see Figure 1c and Methods: Architectural and Energetic Modeling of Building Archetypes and Methods: Climate Change Pathways). Each residence unit also contains a “decision-maker” who decides whether to adopt certain technologies based on the incentives and information available to them (see Methods: Technology Adoption), which in turn are governed by policy and economic scenarios (see Figure 1d and Methods: Policy Instruments for Technology Adoption). For buildings whose occupants decide to adopt high-efficiency/green technologies (e.g., HVAC, smart thermostats, solar photovoltaics) the annual energy demand is reduced accordingly (see Methods: Efficiency Improvements of Adopted Technologies). Finally, as a simplification, the energy demand is assumed to be met using fully electrified buildings. This simplification allows us to estimate the resulting CO2 equivalent emissions based on grid carbon content (see Figure 1e and Methods: Grid Decarbonization Pathways). The result is a model, which for each decade can provide the composition (type of buildings) of a neighborhood, the technology diffusion within it, its energy demand under different climate change assumptions, and annual equivalent CO2 emissions. Other metrics and inputs can be easily integrated at the individual parcel and residence level, which makes this a very versatile tool to explore potential pathways and mitigation strategies and policies. Notice that here we do not consider emissions linked to transportation.","[""abstract""]"

But flight disruption from Omicron may prevent a recovery to 2019 levels until 2024. By then sustainable aviation fuels (sustainable aviation fuel [SAF]—see survey) and more efficient aircraft may start chipping away at conventional jet fuel growth. The emergence of the omicron coronavirus variant has led to widespread flight cancellation over the festive period and temporarily set back the prospects of a full recovery in the global jet fuel market—the sector most affected by the pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Airlines removed many millions of seats from their planned capacity for the first quarter of 2022 leading up to Christmas, with further cuts over following weeks—although concern has eased somewhat as January has progressed, given the new variant's lower severity among the vaccinated. Before Omicron, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), which represents some 290 airlines comprising 83% of global air traffic, had expressed cautious optimism for domestic aviation sectors in 2022. It predicted domestic activity would reach 93% of 2019 levels, while international routes would trail with levels of just 44%. By the end of the year, projections ranged from a 75% traffic recovery in Europe, to 65% for the North Atlantic and just 11% in Asia. Given the hit in Asia, Energy Intelligence says overall global jet fuel demand will only reach 6.2 mn bpd in 2022, 20% below its peak in 2019; and just 6.9 mn bpd in 2023. Jet fuel demand uncertainties could weaken global oil demand forecasts—in contrast to 2009 to 2019 when global air traffic growth meant jet fuel was a reliable 4%/ yr contributor to overall oil demand growth. Airlines also face huge operational challenges due to the pandemic, while jet fuel prices are at 7-year highs. There is also increasing pressure from low carbon regulations and costs, as well as from passengers who want to minimize their carbon footprint. IATA says the EU's Fit for 55 package to reduce emissions could add €39 billion to annual airline expenses by 2035—nearly twice the €22 billion industry-wide profit in 2019. Meeting the net-zero target requires massive outlays for SAF purchases and carbon offsets. What is more, it is steadily rising— voluntary and mandated carbon prices are setting regular price records in the EU and United Kingdom. The collapse in demand has also affected jet markets directly. Spot barrels in the Singapore jet fuel market fell sharply in December, and prices dipped around the time of the Omicron announcement. However, the relative price weakness did not last long because the market and refiners were able to quickly react and adjust product yields—producing more diesel and gasoline instead. IATA has called for governments to follow the World Health Organization advice and immediately rescind travel bans that were introduced in response to the virus, but so far, many countries have ignored this—notably, China, which has some of the most draconian international travel restrictions.","[""abstract""]"

A total of 12 possible selection indexes were considered. These indexes were developed to predict changes in gross per-animal methane production (using 3 scenarios depending on availability and efficacy of a direct methane trait breeding value prediction) with 4 different carbon prices, integrating them into an augmentation of the current conventional national selection index. Although some economic response is lost with inclusion of the GHG subindexes in the Balanced Performance Index, options do exist where this loss is marginal and, even in scenarios where all selection pressure is based on the environmental weighting, economic progress is still made in all cases. When including environmental traits within an index, if a relatively low percentage of economic gain or index progression is sacrificed, then approximately 40 to 50% of the maximum possible reductions in emissions may be achieved. This concurrent selection of estimated breeding values that have a correlated favorable response in emissions in addition to direct selection on a residual methane trait allows a high level of methane reduction to be achieved with a realized cost to farmers that is far lower than the economic value placed on carbon. By implementing a GHG subindex in the national breeding program, we can achieve up to a 7.9% decrease in residual methane and 9 times the reduction in gross emissions in 10 yr, compared with the current breeding program, with little to no cost to farmers. By 2050, selection based on one of the more moderate index scenarios at a carbon price of AUD$250/t (AUD$1 = US$0.71), or opportunity cost to farmers of AUD$87.22, will reduce gross emissions by 8.23% and emissions intensity by 21.25%, therefore offering a mitigation strategy that will be effective at reducing emissions with little compromise to profit.","[""abstract""]"

 Canada has joined the growing list of countries committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. This will require a rapid transition to carbon-free energy systems over the next three decades, with Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) a core component of unlocking Canada's decarbonization objectives.
 It is estimated that Canada will need to capture upwards of 100 million metric tonnes of CO2e per year through CCUS to achieve net zero by 2050. However, Canadian CCUS projects currently face a plethora of commercial hurdles, ranging from capital intensive technology, long investment time horizons, lack of clarity of government incentives and policies, and disjointed carbon markets.
 Carbon pricing policies are one lever to drive industry adoption of CCUS, but a cohesive industry and government collaboration is required to establish the national infrastructure needed to scale and support the development of CCUS in Canada.
 The recent announcement of the Oil Sands Pathways to Net Zero comprises of six oilsands producers, representing 90 percent of oilsands production, and signals a willingness of industry to come together with government to tackle these issues and support the oil sands industry which is projected to add $3 trillion to GDP by 2050. The central pillar of their vision is the use shared transportation infrastructure and storage hubs. This model will require significant government support but what is the right model to secure Canada's future while de-risking public funding.
 Policy development is still required by government bodies to encourage the investment in, and the implementation of these multibillion-dollar, long term projects. The announcement of a Canadian federal investment tax incentive and enforcement of the incoming clean fuel standard may further drive organizations to incorporate CCUS into their decarbonization plans. To proceed, industry will require further clarification to determine the effects of policy decisions and potential government partnerships will have on the cost structure and commercial viability of CCUS projects.
 This paper will outline some of the current commercial barriers that industry faces with the adoption of CCUS. It will provide a roadmap on how to mobilize and partner to scale CCUS in Canada.","[""abstract""]"

Advanced storage can facilitate the profitability of storage and ease the integration of renewables in power systems by reducing costs and allowing an enhanced performance. The profitability requirements of future advanced storage systems (batteries) are assessed in this paper by means of an optimization method and an uncertainty analysis for an optimal Iberian (Spain and Portugal) power system that meets the targets of their National Energy and Climate Plans. Results show that needed storage capacity is only a small part of the demanded energy, but technical advances are required for optimal performance. High prospective storage cost leads to a wind-dominated renewable mix, while low storage cost favours photovoltaics.

However, current food systems are failing on all of these dimensions. In fact, food systems are generating substantial amounts of environmental, health-related, social, and economic externalities negatively affecting the well-being of present and future generations of people, particularly that of the poorest and most vulnerable. True cost accounting approaches, a research frontier in sustainability sciences, seek to comprehensively measure these so far unaccounted externalities from food systems to propose solutions for addressing their negative social welfare effects. Contributing to discussions on true costs of food, this paper traces the environmental costs of ecosystems degradation due to cropland expansion during the period of 2001 to 2009 at the global level. The results show that cropland expansion caused by growing food demands has led to the degradation of 511 million hectares of higher value forest, woodland, shrubland and grassland ecosystems globally, with the total economic costs equaling 435 billion U.S. dollars. This means that each year the global community is incurring 54 billion U.S. dollars of externality costs from food systems because of cropland expansion alone. Addressing this problem requires a flexible government regulation combining incentive mechanisms such as payments for ecosystem services and carbon pricing, with legislative deterrents, e. g., environmentally friendly cadastral planning, fines, and taxes. Current research on true cost accounting is primarily focused on identifying the extent of externalities from food systems. However, knowledge does not always automatically translate into action. The key impetus for future actions for true pricing of food would come from closing knowledge gaps on transaction costs for the implementation of true pricing and the development of innovative solutions for reducing them.","[""abstract""]"

 The global consensus on the threat of climate change risk leads to an agreement to mitigate higher greenhouse gas emissions and limit global mean temperature rise to below 2 ℃ and, ideally, below 1.5 ℃ by 2050. In achieving the mean temperature target, international organisations like the World Bank, Organisation of Economic Co-operation Development and United Nations strongly suggest that policymakers implement a carbon pricing policy. A carbon tax is a market-based policy that has gained attention from many policymakers to reduce carbon emissions and increase the government's revenue. Designing a feasible carbon tax framework is crucial to ensure effectiveness and public acceptability. However, policy design in developing countries may be more complicated than in developed countries due to insufficient income and resources, social inequity, and poverty. This paper discusses the features of a carbon tax and the dimensions of designing an effective carbon tax policy for developing nations. A simplified framework for carbon tax implementation in developing countries is provided. The framework should be a foundation for developing countries to implement and develop a feasible and acceptable carbon tax policy.

Our results show that the charging load profile is the result of various determinants including the dynamic electricity price, price elasticity of charging demand, travel and dwelling constraints, carbon price, as well as exclusive home and shared nonhome charging patterns. The effectiveness of changing charging behavior through internalizing climate damage to obtain environmental benefits depends largely on charging price strategies, implying that policymakers should consider charging price strategies in conjunction with carbon pricing rather than independently.","[""abstract""]"

Besides government measures, the demand for carbon neutral products or the impacts of climate change such as extreme weather conditions leading to higher costs for the affected firms may also promote eco-innovation activities. For the first time, the new wave of the Community Innovation Survey 2020 in Germany allows an analysis of the effects of climate change policy and costs, demand for climate friendly goods and extreme weather conditions on (eco-)innovation. The results of probit and treatment effect models show that innovative firms seem to be significantly more affected by climate change measures and consequences compared to other firms. All climate change indicators are positively correlated to eco-innovations. Interestingly, other innovation activities also profit from the extent to which a firm is affected by climate change albeit the marginal effects are lower compared to eco-innovations. Demand for climate neutral products is significantly important for all eco-product-innovations.","[""abstract""]"

Carbon pricing policy is one of the most powerful tools for reducing emissions. However, most researches focused on carbon emissions allowances trade price prediction, only few investigations paid attention to carbon emissions allowances trade volume prediction. In order to better understand carbon emissions of carbon emissions, this study performed long-term prediction and short-term prediction models to predict carbon emissions trading volume. Linear regression, Decision tree, Random forest, Extreme gradient boosting and Support vector machine were chosen to perform long-term prediction. In these five long-term prediction models, Random Forest performs best with the smallest mean absolute error (24.42). What’s more, a time series forward multi-step hybrid intelligent prediction model (consists of reinforcement learning model, hidden Markov model and neural network) was used to perform short-term prediction, which improves the accuracy and effect of the prediction. The mean absolute error of short-term prediction is 6.79. Our study shows there is a nonlinear relationship between the lag of volume/frequency of transactions and price in the future. The machine learning-based Carbon emissions allowances trade prediction enables traders and environmental organizations to observe the overall carbon emissions trading volume trends and changes as well as judge the short-term trading situation and make judgments.","[""abstract""]"

The proposed CBAM also appears to cite the intermediate objective of ensuring a ‘level playing field’ for carbon pricing, but it is difficult to see the rationale for retroactively equalizing only the carbon price while ignoring the costs paid by producers to support other policies aimed at curbing nationwide GHG emissions and the costs of reducing the emissions from their own products. These issues essentially stem from the CBAM’s inherent and fundamental constraints in the institutional design that charges for emissions from the production process outside the EU’s jurisdiction and cannot be remedied by superficially tweaking the associated mechanism. The CBAM could be justified under Article XX(g) as a measure ‘relating to the conservation of’ an atmosphere with low GHG density without scrutinizing these issues. However, it is questionable to interpret Article XX(g) as authorizing inefficient resource conservation through unilateral measures, despite the exporting country potentially being able to conserve resources more efficiently.

Decisions over restoration must balance limited resources, land constraints, and competing demands. Peatlands in Southeast Asia have been heavily impacted by agricultural expansion over the past three decades, with Indonesia now accounting for a substantial proportion of degraded tropical peatlands globally. Using spatial linear programming, we focus on prioritizing peatland restoration sites in Indonesia for fire risk reduction, climate change mitigation, species conservation, and cost-effectiveness. The study finds that restoring peatlands at 1 km2 planning units can generate multiple co-benefits such as reduced fire risks by 6%–37%, attenuated extinction risks of peatland specialist bird species and mitigated climate change potential of 0.002–0.36 Pg CO2e yr−1. These benefits were reduced but still of comparable magnitude when larger areas of planning (defined by village and catchment boundaries) were used. The results, although indicative, support tropical peatland restoration as a cost-efficient strategy for mitigating climate change, reducing fire, conserving biodiversity, and supporting sustainable development that can be offset by carbon prices of USD 2–37/Mg CO2e.","[""abstract""]"

Unconfined compressive strength (UCS), water content and pH measurements on biochar, Portland composite cement (CEM II) and peat compositions and a sustainability assessment were conducted. It was found that biochar amendment increased strength and stiffness of peat and cement-stabilised peat. Biochar showed the potential to reduce the cement amount when stabilising peat while retaining geotechnical properties. Peat stabilised with 200 kg/m3 of biochar and 100 kg/m3 of cement exhibited comparable strength (63.3±4.2 kPa, n = 3) as samples with 200 kg/m3 of cement (63.2±1.3 kPa, n = 3), but with a negative carbon footprint. Adding biochar quantities greater than 27% of the cement quantities resulted in a climate-neutral stabilisation. At a carbon price of approximately 85 €/tonne, the biochar costs equalled the cement costs. The cement-only samples outperformed the ones with additional biochar in terms of shear strength/€, while future carbon prices increased the competitiveness of biochar amendments.","[""abstract""]"

Even for the most optimistic, it remains unclear whether we can expect a successful negotiating outcome by 2015. There are inherent difficulties associated with climate change negotiations, ranging from which countries should bear most responsibility for a given emission reduction target to the assessment of a globally efficient time path for pricing harmful greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs): and these difficulties become even more complex and challenging under the pervasive uncertainty of climate science and the uncertainty about the feedback loop between climate damages and economic growth. During the past decades, the environmental economics literature has provided important insights regarding the design of environmental fiscal policies and treaties but there is a host of issues that remain relatively unexplored. For instance, little do we know about the cooperative solution of carbon and trade policies when climate change affects the productive possibilities of countries. In this context, it is also not obvious whether observed policies could be improved upon in such a way that all countries gain in welfare. It remains also unclear what the carbon extraction path should be in the absence of a comprehensive treaty (such as, for example, if environmental policy is unilaterally chosen subject to an agreed ‘ceiling’ in global temperature). Though carbon pricing instruments like carbon taxes, cap-and-trade and hybrids have been well studied, not much is known about their properties in the presence of ‘offset’ schemes such as the Clean Development Mechanism. More work is also required to understand the strategic implications of the uncertainty surrounding climate change and how this affects, for example, the choice of climate change strategy (‘precautionary’ or ‘wait and see’), how uncertainty impacts on the propensity of countries to sign a climate treaty, and the extent to which the possibility of a climate catastrophe fosters or hinders cooperation.

The economy of CO2-EOR can significantly benefit from the recent rise of carbon prices in carbon markets due to its greenhouse gas (GHG) emission savings. This study conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) of CO2-EOR in major hydrocarbon provinces of the world. Estimated net GHG emissions of CO2-EOR were compared with GHG emissions of average produced oil in the given country. When sourcing CO2 from coal-fired power plants, Kazakhstan and China have net GHG emissions of CO2-EOR of 276 and 380 kg CO2 eq/bbl, respectively, which are lower than the GHG emission factor of average oil produced in each of them. Significantly lower GHG emissions of CO2-EOR are observed in other hydrocarbon provinces (Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, etc.), where CO2 could be delivered from Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plants. However, the cost of CO2 capture is higher at NGCC power plants than at coal-fired power plants. Further, we developed a techno-economic assessment (TEA) model of the CO2-EOR and integrated it with LCA to thoroughly consider carbon credits in its economy. The model was built based upon previous investigations and used statistics from a large industrial data set of CO2-EOR to produce accurate estimates of the CO2-EOR economy. The technical model iteratively estimated the balance of three fluids (crude oil, CO2, and water) in the CO2-EOR system with a 25 year operational lifespan and obtained actual data for the LCA and TEA models. The model was simulated for the Kazakhstan case with its oil market conditions for a demonstration purpose. TEA results showed that, with the available low-cost CO2 capture source or high CO2 cost in carbon trading, CO2-EOR can compete with current upstream projects in Kazakhstan by simultaneously increasing oil production and reducing GHG emissions.","[""abstract""]"
"249279157","null","null","1 CHALLENGES IN CLIMATE CHANGE ECONOMICS","2019","0","Economists have long argued that the best way to fight climate change is to levy a price on carbon emissions, either via a global specific carbon tax or a competitive worldwide market for emission permits. This price should be Pigouvian and equal the present value of current and future global warming damages and be the same throughout the world. Despite decades of climate negotiations, very little success has been achieved in implementing such first-best climate policies. This disappointing cleavage between theory and practice poses three important challenges to economists. First, global warming is the only truly global externality and therefore policy makers are confronted with huge free riding problems and countries choosing to protect jobs in fossil-based industries at home in favour of protecting the planet (such as the United States under President Trump). International climate agreements do not cover all countries of the world. So if only some countries price carbon, this will depress the world price of coal, oil and gas and thus some of the cuts in emissions will be offset by higher emissions elsewhere. These carbon leakage problems can be overcome to an extent by border tax adjustments or so-called “climate clubs” that punish third non-participating countries with a stiff trade tariff of around 5% (Nordhaus, 2015). Second, most politicians have a tendency to procrastinate and postpone carbon pricing so that their successors have to deal with the unpopular task of fighting climate change. Politicians also prefer the “stick” to the “carrot” and therefore choose to give huge renewable energy subsidies and green R&D subsidies instead of pricing carbon. Although such policies work eventually in locking up more carbon in the crust of the earth, they waste public money and induce rent seeking. Furthermore, both postponing climate policy and subsidising renewable energy induces coal, oil and gas producers to exhaust their reserves more quickly and thus to accelerate carbon emissions and global warming. These Green Paradox effects thus add on to the carbon leakage effects. As far as financial markets are concerned, there is a risk of stranded financial assets to do with irreversible investments if policy makers suddenly take credible and effective action to fight global warming. Third, the energy transition towards a carbon-free economy requires huge technological innovations.","[""abstract""]"

With higher carbon prices looming on the horizon, fossil fuel exporters and industrial sectors – as well as heavy-duty trucking, shipping and aviation – need alternatives to decarbonise. Most are looking to electricity-based fuels and feedstocks such as hydrogen, ammonia and methanol to replace hydrocarbons. This will revolutionise energy trade, with total trade declining by as much as 50% and virtually all remaining traded oil gas and coal being either completely decarbonised or backed by offsets. With 147 GWel (giga‐watts electrolyser capacity) in announced projects, green hydrogen produced from renewable electricity is ahead of the game. And while its export supply chains are complex, requiring conversion into a ‘product’ to allow delivery, there is no exploration risk as in oil and gas projects. Worldwide, national hydrogen roadmaps are being passed, with virtually all oil and gas companies, utilities and industrials backing at least one hydrogen project. Focus is now shifting to future sources of hydrogen supply.

We explore the consequences of three different methods for measuring on-farm emissions: national accounting methods, an amended version of those methods and use of best-available local data. Estimated emissions under the three methods can vary widely; for example, on a case study farm in Western Australia, local data indicated 44 per cent lower emissions than did the national accounts method. If on-farm emissions are subject to an emissions price, the impact on farm profit is large and varies considerably with different measurement methods. For instance, if a price of $23/t of CO2-e applies then farm profit falls by 14.4–30.8 per cent depending on the measurement method. Thus, the choice of measurement method can have large distributional consequences. On the other hand, inaccurate measurement results in relatively minor deadweight losses. On-farm sequestration through reafforestation may lessen the impact of an emissions price on farm businesses, although it will require a high carbon price to be viable, especially if sequestration rates are underestimated or low.","[""abstract""]"

Furthermore, with confidence level of carbon price uncertainty rising, the dispatch costs and carbon emissions increase accordingly.","[""abstract""]"

Yet cap-and-trade regulations would take years for EPA to develop and implement, the desired price signal for carbon dioxide might be difficult to achieve until years later, and administration and enforcement of a comprehensive cap and trade system poses significant challenges. The urgency of the climate change crisis calls for immediate action, which can be provided best by a carbon tax imposed on all coal, natural gas, and oil produced in the United States and imported from other countries. A carbon tax could be implemented and enforced without the need for a complex new regulatory scheme and would provide an immediate carbon price signal. In addition, revenue from a carbon tax could support research and development of alternative energy and ease any regressive effects of the tax. Moreover, adoption of a carbon tax during 2009 would provide the United States much needed credibility on climate change issues and would allow the United States to focus its climate change efforts on negotiation of a new international agreement that provides meaningful carbon dioxide emission reductions by industrialized nations and less developed countries.","[""abstract""]"

B. da Fonseca, Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Guy Midgley, Jonah Busch, Lee Hannah, Russell A. Mittermeier New research indicates that slowing tropical deforestation may play a much larger role in mitigating climate change than previously believed [1,2]. Carbon emissions from tropical deforestation are expected to increase atmospheric CO2 concentration by between 29 and 129 ppm within 100 years, much more than previously estimated [3]. The parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are considering policy approaches and incentives for reducing emissions from deforestation (RED) in developing countries [4–6] that are timely, in light of these recent research fi ndings. The leading proposals would enable trading of carbon saved by reducing tropical deforestation, just as carbon is currently traded from reducing industrial emissions. The state of these discussions suggests that a key group of countries are at risk of being omitted from a new framework—those with high forest cover and low rates of deforestation (HFLD). Developing countries can be classifi ed into four categories defi ned by two axes: remaining forest cover and deforestation rate (Figure 1). The HFLD countries in Quadrant IV harbor 18% of tropical forest carbon. Since current proposals would award carbon credits to countries based on their reductions of emissions from a recent historical reference rate [4], HFLD countries could be left with little potential for RED credits. Nor would they have the potential for reforestation credits under the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism that the countries in Quadrant II have. Without the opportunity to sell carbon credits, HFLD countries would be deprived of a major incentive to maintain low deforestation rates. Since drivers of deforestation are mobile, deforestation reduced elsewhere could shift to HFLD countries, constituting a signifi cant setback to stabilizing global concentrations of greenhouse gases at the lowest possible levels. An effective RED carbon regime should not allow leaks of deforestation to new regions, but should reduce net global emissions by encouraging comprehensive changes in international behavior. Some analysts have proposed adopting a reference emission rate indexed to the global deforestation rate for countries with little or no historic deforestation [7,8]. This would effectively award HFLD countries with “preventive credits” that these countries would stand to forfeit if they were to increase their deforestation rate. Preventive credits would provide a signifi cant entry barrier to new forest exploitation or policies that promote or allow deforestation. HFLD countries would receive a signifi cant incentive to maintain low rates of deforestation from any reference emission rate indexed to the global average. At US$10/ton CO2, using one-third of the global average deforestation rate as the reference emission rate for HFLD countries, preventive credits would be worth US$365 million annually to seven countries. Using one-half of the global average deforestation rate as the reference rate would more than double the qualifying forest area, and would increase credit value to US$630 million annually to ten countries (Table 1). Using the global average deforestation rate as the reference rate would increase credit value to US$1.8 billion annually to 11 countries. Despite the advantages of crediting for HFLD countries, some practical concerns remain. Introducing an additional source of carbon credits could lower the price of carbon, weakening the incentive to reduce deforestation in countries where rates are high. However, preventive credits should be evaluated in light of their net effect in reducing global CO2 emissions. The volume of preventive credits necessary to create an advance incentive against deforestation in HFLD countries would be 10–49 million tons of carbon annually, depending on which reference rate is selected. This is equivalent to just 1.3%–6.5% of developing countries’ emissions from deforestation. The greater the global demand for carbon credits, the less impact this increase in supply would have on carbon price. In return, preventive credits would extend substantial protection to nearly one-fi fth of tropical forest carbon. Finally, countries like Brazil, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are so large that they have regions in multiple quadrants. The Brazilian Amazon has attributes similar to the countries in Quadrant IV, and RED credits are being negotiated for the region [9]. While the doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0050216.g001","[""abstract""]"

A non-linear programming model considering uncertain demands is proposed in this paper to implement a cost-benefit analysis for the generating companies. Our research results show that with the increase of carbon price, the optimal production quantity and the actual carbon emission drop down. The optimal investment of green improvement is an increasing function of carbon price. However, the emission quota has only impact on the transaction quantity of emission permit in the carbon market. It has nothing to do with the optimal production quantity and investment of green improvement.","[""abstract""]"

Furthermore, offsets (reduction or removal of greenhouse gas emissions that counterbalances emissions elsewhere in the economy) are a potential area of expansion of interest to the agricultural sector. Agrichar is one of the new technologies and farming practices being investigated to counteract carbon-price-imposed costs. Its two claimed benefits, which relate both to the profitability of sugarcane growers as well as to climate change, are the reduction in fertiliser application and the carbon which agrichar can store in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years. This study drew on the Farm Economics Analysis Tool (FEAT) developed by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries specifically for the sugarcane industry. An analysis was conducted for a typical sugarcane farming enterprise in the Herbert region of north Queensland. The scenarios included in the analysis recognised the change in input prices as a price is put on carbon, the change in farm practices when agrichar is included in operations and the potential to trade in offsets from that additional carbon stored by the use of agrichar. The sugarcane grower was found to benefit from the inclusion of agrichar into the operations. Agrichar is seen as a potential and viable option for sugarcane growers and should be considered as an alternative under the emissions trading scheme to minimise the impact of the rise in input costs. Further scientific and policy development could result in the possibility for stored carbon to be traded in the offsets market, providing additional, although minor, cash flow to the grower.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This linkage increases their resistance to accepting such caps. Also, the profitability of offsets motivates developing countries to insist on stricter caps on industrialized na‐ tions, because stricter caps increase the demand for offset credits supplied by developing countries. Caps on their own emissions, however, have now been rejected by developing countries. This leaves offsets, on a massive scale, as the only path within the Kyoto framework for restraining the bulk of emissions growth. But offsets over‐pay for emission reductions, and are inefficient and often corrupt. Hence offsets could never be implemented on a sufficient scale to succeed. Instead, a new path to international commitment is required. The remaining possibility for commitment is flexible global carbon pricing, which allows a choice of cap or tax. Developing countries could accept an equal tax, because it leaves them room to grow to the level of developed countries instead of temporarily capping their growth. The lowest emitters would receive international assistance conditional on the implementation of a carbon tax, and Eu‐ rope could keep its caps.","[""abstract""]"

A Ramsey model is built with two types of capital: brown capital that produces a negative externality and green capital that does not. Abatement is obtained through structural change (green capital accumulation) and possibly through under-utilization of brown capital. Capital-based instruments and the carbon price lead to the same long-term balanced growth path, but they differ during the transition phase. The carbon price maximizes social welfare but may cause temporary under-utilization of brown capital, hurting the owners of brown capital and the workers who depend on it. Capital-based instruments cause larger intertemporal welfare loss, but they maintain the full utilization of brown capital, smooth efforts over time, and cause lower immediate utility loss. Green industrial policies including such capital-based instruments may thus be used to increase the political acceptability of a carbon price. More generally, the carbon price informs on the policy effect on intertemporal welfare but is not a good indicator to estimate the impact of the policy on instantaneous output, consumption, and utility.","[""abstract""]"

We consider reforms that raise carbon prices faced by households and reduce the variation in carbon prices across gas and electricity use, improving the efficiency of emissions reduction. We show that the revenue raised from these reforms can be recycled in a way that ameliorates some of the distributional concerns. Whilst such recycling is not able to protect all poorer households, existing policy also makes distributional trade-offs, but does so in an opaque and inefficient way.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Conversion of MSW to fuel could displace petroleum-derived fuels to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation, and also avoid the GHG emissions associated with existing waste management strategies such as landfilling. This thesis quantifies the lifecycle GHG emissions and economic feasibility of middle distillate (MD) fuel, including diesel and jet fuel, derived from MSW in the United States via three thermochemical conversion pathways: conventional gasification and Fischer-Tropsch (FT MD), plasma gasification and FischerTropsch (Plasma FT MD) and, conventional gasification, catalytic alcohol synthesis and alcoholto-jet upgrading (ATJ MD). Expanded system boundaries are used to capture the change in existing MSW use and disposal, and parameter uncertainty is accounted for with Monte Carlo simulations. The median lifecycle GHG emissions are calculated to be 32.9, 62.3 and 52.7 gCO2e/MJ with standard deviations of 7.2, 9.5 and 13.2 gCO2e/MJ for FT, Plasma FT and ATJ MD fuels, respectively, compared to a baseline of 90 gCO2e/MJ for conventional MD fuels. These results are found to be sensitive to MSW composition, the waste management strategy displaced, plant scale and associated fuel yield, feedstock transportation distance and the co-product allocation method. Median minimum selling prices are estimated at 0.99, 1.78 and 1.20 $ per litre and standard deviations of 0.14, 0.29 and 0.27 $ per litre with the probability of achieving a positive net present value of fuel production at market prices of 14%, 0.1% and 7% for FT, Plasma FT and ATJ MD fuels, respectively. The sensitivity of these results to the discount rate, income tax rate, implementation of carbon price, feedstock cost, scale and process efficiency indicate that policy measures, MSW tipping fees and technological advancements can improve the economic viability of MSW fuels. Considering a societal perspective (e.g. social opportunity cost of capital, social costs of GHG emissions) increases the probability of positive net present value of fuel production to 93%, 67% and 92.5% for the FT, Plasma FT, and ATJ MD fuels, respectively.

The market power of the dominant firm decreased with the introduction of the carbon tax, reducing its profit incentive to lower its coal based generation in some demand conditions and increasing equilibrium carbon emissions. However, when vertically integrated, the dominant firm behaved more competitively and the carbon tax reduced equilibrium carbon emissions. The results indicate that the immediate short-run impacts from carbon taxation can be small and perhaps even induce emissions in imperfect markets. However, these shortrun results have limited long-run implications because it is expected that a carbon price would result in incentives for electricity generators to invest in a less emissions-intensive capital stock. Rather, these short-run findings highlight the importance for an emissions tax to cover a broad base of industries and be long lasting in order to achieve substantive reductions in carbon emissions.","[""abstract""]"

A model implementing mixed-integer linear programming integrates power-to-gas technology and AspenPlus simulates the polygeneration process. The downstream production rates are selected using particle swarm optimization. When comparing 100% electrolysis vs. 100% steam reforming as a source of hydrogen production, electrolysis provides a larger net present value due to the carbon pricing introduced in Canada and the cost reduction from removal of the air separation unit by using the oxygen from the electrolysers. The optimal percent of hydrogen produced from electrolysis is about 82% with a hydrogen input of 7600 kg/h.

Then additional measures are imposed based on the national circumstances of each country; for Canada we simulate a 50% reduction by 2050, and stabilization for China. The scale of the challenge in all cases requires that every available option be vigorously pursued, including energy efficiency, fuel switching, carbon capture and storage, and accelerated development of renewables; to compensate, there are significant co-reductions of local air pollutants such as SOx and NOx. Finally, the abatement cost schedules of China and Canada are compared, and implications considered for carbon permit flows if the cost schedule of the rest of the developed world is assumed to be similar to that of Canada. We found that the developed world and China could collectively reduce emissions by 50% in 2050 at a price of $175/tCO2e, with permits flowing from the developed countries to China; while abatement costs are lower in China up to $75/t, at higher prices reductions are less costly in the developed world.

In 1997, the strategy discussion was still ongoing. However, that year, at the Third Conference of Parties (cop-3) in Kyoto, a Protocol was agreed to (still in the ratification process at the time of this writing) that included provisions to allow countries to meet their reduction commitments by buying credits from other countries. Costa Rica has been a pioneer in developing and selling emission reduction credits. Deforestation is the second largest source of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere and forest growth absorbs carbon dioxide gases (CO2), which contribute to global warming. Costa Rica’s carbon credits come primarily from the conversion of cultivated fields and pastures into forests, as well as from the reduction of deforestation. In 1996 the country sold its first 200,000 tons of carbon emission reduction credits to Norway for us$10 per ton. However, in late 1997 when it tried to auction an additional 1,000,000 tons of carbon credits with a floor price of us$20 per ton, it received no bids. The country is currently evaluating its strategy. Preliminary results show that, depending on the final rules, regulations, and carbon prices, carbon trading is likely to promote the expansion of national park areas and to induce some farmers to switch from traditional agricultural to forest plantations and private forest conservation. These conclusions are very important for two reasons. First, more than 75% of the projects with CO2 mitigation potential from Latin American and African countries are forest-related. Second, forest projects constitute the least cost option of the emerging us$9 billion per annum carbon market between industrialized and developing countries. However, if the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (ipcc) does not clearly recommend including forest projects in the overall climate change mitigation strategy, these projects are likely to be rejected by the Convention or remain 354     in limbo. Moreover, if forest projects are excluded, then fuel-switching projects in large developing countries like China and India will become the least cost options and will capture the bulk of the market, effectively limiting the participation of Latin American and African countries in climate change mitigation activities. Some background on global warming During the last decade, many scientists and policymakers became convinced that increased emissions of carbon dioxide or other “greenhouse gases” (methane, nitrous oxide, and related synthetic compounds) were contributing to the warming of the planet. These emissions had grown with industrialization, particularly from the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, to power industry; to heat, cool, and light homes and offices; and to transport goods and passengers. Deforestation is the second largest source of carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere after fossil fuel combustion. Several factors have made it difficult to reach an agreement on a global warming mitigation strategy. First, there is still substantial scientific uncertainty about the link between global warming and the so-called greenhouse gases. To many it seems obvious that the planet is warming. Proof comes in the form of receding polar ice caps and the 14 warmest years in recorded history all happening within the last two decades (temperatures have been recorded since 1866). However, it is still unclear whether warming is a long-term trend and to what extent the build up of greenhouse gases is contributing to it. The scientific models of climate change are so complex and sensitive that small and plausible differences in assumptions could significantly alter predictions about future temperatures. Second, the benefits of preventing global warming are in dispute. Concerned scientists forecast that rising temperatures will lead to massive coastal flooding, dramatic changes in crop yields, more violent storms, the extinction of species due to habitat loss, and other terrible results.Yet others argue that the world may adapt to rising temperatures without enormous suffering or cost, particularly if the temperature increase is not too extreme. Some models also indicate that global warming might help many parts of the world by increasing rainfall and extending growing seasons. Third, there is disagreement about how the burden of reducing greenhouse gas emissions should be shared among the countries of the world. Historically, industrialized countries have emitted the lion’s share of greenhouse gases; the United States alone has accounted for nearly 25%. However, the “business-as-usual” forecasts show that the proportion of emissions from developing countries will rise rapidly as they industrialize (see Table 1). Developing countries argue that they should not have to reduce their emissions below their current modest levels, and should be allowed some margin for growth. Industrialized nations are reluctant to bear the burden alone, however, or to make sacrifices that might encourage profligate emissions by others. The strategy debate has been further complicated by uncertainty as to how much it will cost to reduce emissions. Pessimists point out that sources of energy with low or no greenhouse gas emissions tend to be either fairly expensive (such as solar or wind power) or to present other environmental risks (such as nuclear power). Optimists argue that the costs of alternative energy sources and cleaner 1 Estimates of annual global emissions from deforestation range from 0.6 to 2.8 billion tons, compared to around 6.0 billion tons from fossil fuel combustion (Houghton 1991; Smith et al. 1993). 355 -,    - technologies would decline rapidly once businesses and households were given incentives. The potentially high costs of reducing emissions make tradable emissions credits more attractive. The basic idea is that every country will agree to reduce emissions by a certain amount and if countries that can reduce emissions at a relatively low cost are able to exceed their reduction commitments, they would be allowed to sell “credits” for the excess to countries where emissions reduction is more expensive. The United States successfully established a domestic market for emissions credits to help reduce sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants in the 1990s. The hope is that a similar market for greenhouse gas emission credits could reduce the cost of slowing global warming. International conventions on climate change The countries of the world took a key step toward a global agreement on climate change in 1988 when they established the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change () to assess the scientific, technical, and socioeconomic research on climate change. The ’ work helped convince many in the world community that the risk of global warming was serious enough to warrant action. This led to the United Nations’ Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The Parties to the Rio summit approved the United Nations Convention on Climate Change, which called for the rollback of greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels and was later ratified by 165 countries. The Convention set no specific targets for individual countries, however, so its effect was more symbolic than practical. A subsequent summit in Berlin in 1994 also saw only limited progress. By 1997, however, concern about global warming had increased to the point that at the third Conference of Parties in Kyoto more specific measures were actual projected annual % change 1995 202","[""abstract""]"

This paper compares the relative performance of various regional measures for carbon pricing based on the following criteria: jurisdictional basis, data availability, environmental effectiveness and avoidance strategies, impact on competitiveness, differentiation for developing countries, and incentives for reaching a global agreement. The main finding is that, if carefully designed, a cargo-based measure that covers the emissions released throughout the whole voyage to the cargo destination presents various advantages compared with other carbon pricing schemes.

Specifically, the focus is on modeling analyses that have attempted to quantify the emissions reductions necessary to achieve a defined set of stabilization targets. The scenarios analyzed include information on the path of emissions reductions, changes in technology, and prices for emissions needed to reach different stabilization levels. As such, they provide insight on the near-term actions—particularly with regard to carbon prices and technology developments—that would be consistent with achieving long-term environmental objectives. The broad picture given by the model scenarios can help inform near-term policy. Although the models differ in their details, several messages emerge. Given current estimates of the relationship • between GHG concentrations and global temperature change, stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2) at 450–650 parts per million (ppm) by volume significantly reduces the expected change in global average surface temperature and associated impacts relative to baseline projections for increased GHG concentrations. Most modeling scenarios for cost-• effectively achieving a 550 ppm CO 2 (670 ppm CO 2-e 1) stabilization target show U.S. and global emissions leveling off over the next several decades, with a slight initial rise in emissions that peaks by 2020–2040, and a declining trajectory thereafter. Stabilizing at lower concentration levels would require that emissions start declining sooner; while a less protective (higher concentration) target would allow for a longer period of continued emissions growth and/or slower decline. To cost-effectively stabilize atmospheric • CO 2 at about 550 ppm, most models require that global carbon prices rise to $5–$30 per metric ton of CO 2 in the next 20 years, increasing to $20–$90 per metric ton by 2050, and continuing to rise thereafter. These modeling scenarios assume an idealized, flexible, comprehensive, least-cost approach to reducing emissions. Costs could therefore be significantly higher in the context of real-world policy where countries set different levels and trends of policy stringency, do not cover all sectors, do not include all GHGs, or employ relatively costly policy instruments. For example, limiting mitigation to CO 2 (rather than all GHGs) could roughly double the CO 2 prices needed to achieve a given stabilization goal.

Linking these different carbon markets with the ultimate goal of establishing a global carbon market is seen by many as an integral part of the future climate regime, since it can increase the pool of mitigation options available, thereby reducing costs and allowing countries to increase their climate ambition. These benefits however only materialize if the linked carbon markets have a similar level of ambition and a similar design for a number of key features, such as price controls, quantitative and qualitative restrictions on carbon offsets, and the type of allocation method. Paradoxically, while lower abatement costs are an important economic motive for linking two emission trading systems, they can also constitute a significant political barrier, since citizens of the higher cost system might be reluctant to pay for emission reductions in the other jurisdiction. An analysis of seven existing carbon markets shows that the experience from linking the carbon markets in California and Quebec can provide valuable lessons for any future linkages. Notably, the two regions had very similar policy designs of their carbon markets before linking in 2013 because both Quebec and California are part of the Western Climate Initiative, which is a regional collaboration among several jurisdictions. Moreover, in both regions, carbon pricing is only a support measure to increase the effectiveness of complimentary climate policies that allow the governments to retain a degree of control over their climate standards. In addition, several safeguards were introduced in the linked system, including an auction floor price to guarantee a minimum carbon price and holding limits that restrict the amount of surplus allowances that participants can hold to bank for future use. The analysis of the design features of emissions trading systems in other parts of the world also shows that other ETS have already learnt from the lessons of the EU ETS, especially how to avoid the build-up of a substantial oversupply of emissions allowances depressing the carbon price to very low levels. Other existing ETS have for example introduced measures such as a floor price on allowances sold at auction and safeguards against the accumulation of a large amount of surplus allowances.

We explore the implications of regulatory uncertainty on generation technology choice and the optimal timing of investment, and assess the implications of these choices for regulators. We find that interaction of regulatory uncertainty with irreversible investment always raises the social cost of carbon abatement. Further, the social cost of regulatory uncertainty is strongly dependent on the relative competitiveness of IGCC plants, for which the cost of later carbon capture retrofits is comparatively small, and on the firm's ability to use investments in natural gas generation as a transitional strategy to manage carbon regulation uncertainty. Without highly competitive IGCC or low gas prices, regulatory uncertainty can increase the expected social cost of reducing emissions by 40 to 60%.","[""abstract""]"

Despite the theoretical attractions, it has become debatable whether carbon markets by themselves can offer a complete solution. We address this through a modelling framework, stylised for the GB power market within the EU ETS, which includes three distinct components: (a) a long-term least-cost capacity planning model, similar in functionality to many used in policy analysis, but innovative in providing the endogenous calculation of carbon prices; (b) a short-term price risk model producing hourly dispatch and pricing outputs, which are used to test the annual financial performance risks implied by the longer-term investments; (c) an agent-based model which uses a computational learning algorithm to derive pricing behaviour in imperfect markets. The results indicate that the risk/return profile of electricity markets deteriorates substantially as a result of decarbonisation, reducing the propensity of companies to invest in the absence of increased government support. Markets may adjust, if allowed, by deferring investment until conditions improve, or by consolidating to increase market power, or by operating in a tighter market with reduced spare capacity. To the extent that each of these ‘market-led’ solutions may be politically unpalatable, policy design will need to sustain a delicate regulatory regime, moderating the increasing market power of companies whilst maintaining low-carbon subsidies for longer than expected.","[""abstract""]"

Especially since Business as Usual (BaU) scenario studies project that the emissions due to shipping could increase by 50 [%] to 250 [%] in the period to 2050 (IMO, 2015), shipowners face a potential regulatory threat. Major climate regulations for shipping already entered into force, and a range of possible instruments may be applied going forward. Possible instruments are among others, tightened EEDI limits, port discounts, ETS, or a Carbon Tax. Besides the risk of direct regulation, there is also a risk of being indirectly impacted by energy and/or climate regulation in other sectors. The direct and indirect regulations can adversely impact the operations, cashflow, and economic value of enterprises of existing shipowners and charterers of ships. Shipowners and financiers that are unaware of these developments, or that do not take timely mitigating actions, may potentially face considerable financial losses. This research investigated and ranked the level of Carbon Risk for shipowners across several sub sectors. The objective of the research was to: define, measure, and reveal the level of Carbon Risk for shipowners and to assess mitigating strategies as part of the assessment of the bank’s exposure to Carbon Risk. Typical core drivers, factors, and dependencies have been studied from literature in order to come up with an effective approach to capture the threat of Carbon Risk. As a result, a Carbon Risk framework is been developed, showing (inter)dependencies between all Carbon Risk factors. By developing the framework, this research contributed to the current understanding of the (inter)dependencies between Carbon Risk factors. In addition to the framework, typical Carbon Risks have been identified for the shipping industry. This research focuses on Structural Risk. A Carbon Tax is used as a proxy for Regulatory Risk and demand substitution (i.e. a 20 [%] reduction of cargo) is used as proxy for Substitution Risk. By distinguishing vessels by type and size, we account for different technical, operational, and market characteristics. We focus on crude oil tankers, container ships, and bulk carriers because they are the three most significant sectors from a CO2 perspective (IMO, 2015). The presented findings about the difference in impact between sub segments could have implications for risk premiums which financiers can set on loans. Also, given that the DCF of fuel-efficient investments is positive related to a Carbon Tax, it is assumed that fuel efficient technologies and retrofits become more viable. Even before regulatory certainty, it is advised that shipowners and financiers (as part of their Carbon Risk mitigation strategy) research fuel efficient mitigation options (technological investments) under different Carbon Tax levels. Even without Carbon pricing, efficiency measures generate significant cost savings. When there is certainty about future market-based measures, early adaptors/investors of viable fuel-efficient measures (under future regulatory conditions) will benefit most of the investment and improve their competitive position. Also, when shipowners act sooner than competitors, they lower the risk of scarcity of resources (yards, engineers).","[""abstract""]"

Current national climate policy plans proposed under the Paris Agreement lead to higher emissions until 2030 than cost-effective pathways towards the Agreements' long-term temperature goals would imply. Therefore, the current plans would require highly disruptive changes, prohibitive transition speeds, and large long-term deployment of risky mitigation measures for achieving the agreement's temperature goals after 2030. Since the prospects of introducing the cost-effective policy instrument, a global comprehensive carbon price in the near-term, are negligible, we study how a strengthening of existing plans by a global roll-out of regional policies can ease the implementation challenge of reaching the Paris temperature goals. The regional policies comprise a bundle of regulatory policies in energy supply, transport, buildings, industry, and land use and moderate, regionally differentiated carbon pricing. We find that a global roll-out of these policies could reduce global CO2 emissions by an additional 10 GtCO2eq in 2030 compared to current plans. It would lead to emissions pathways close to the levels of cost-effective likely below 2 °C scenarios until 2030, thereby reducing implementation challenges post 2030. Even though a gradual phase-in of a portfolio of regulatory policies might be less disruptive than immediate cost-effective carbon pricing, it would perform worse in other dimensions. In particular, it leads to higher economic impacts that could become major obstacles in the long-term. Hence, such policy packages should not be viewed as alternatives to carbon pricing, but rather as complements that provide entry points to achieve the Paris climate goals.","[""abstract""]"

The second argument concerns the importance of exploring how proponents and opponents of climate action strive to develop “spatial anchors” for justice claims to increase their legitimacy in policy debates. Based on analysis of carbon pricing controversies in Australia, the article illustrates how supporters of carbon pricing initiatives stressed international justice issues, whereas opponents mobilized multiscalar and multivalent international, national, regional, and local justice narratives to gain traction for their arguments.

We find that although the expansion of the wind-generation sector in South Australia has delivered meaningful reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions in just over 10 years, the limitations of strongly correlated and variable electricity supply that is decoupled from electricity demand place upper limits on the plausible future contribution from wind. System costs arise from integrating these sources, both from managing uncorrelated supply and the declining availability of ancillary services such as the frequency control provided by synchronous generators. These costs have been minimal to date, largely due to the connection to the National Electricity Market and already available, open-cycle gas turbines as reserve margins. However, evidence of large-scale integration costs is emerging and expected to increase should wind continue to grow in penetration. Development of the South Australian hot dry-rock geothermal resource has confirmed the well-documented challenges in developing this energy source, with still no operating power supply after more than 30 years of development. Solar–thermal technology remains uneconomic in the absence of either substantial subsidies or high carbon pricing. Given these inherent constraints, the deployment of nuclear energy technology provides the pathway of greatest technical and economic certainty for the permanent displacement of fossil-fuelled baseload electricity generation in South Australia. Nuclear power is, however, hampered by legislative barriers and requirements for the development of legal and regulatory frameworks. Support for the nuclear option is broadening within South Australia, and innovative economic development strategies based on the deployment of generation IV ‘integral fast reactors’ could spur the necessary bi-partisan political support to transition the State’s electricity supply entirely to low-emissions sources.","[""abstract""]"

Economic Considerations: Cost-Effective and Efficient Climate Policies","2016","11","In this chapter we discuss the economics of climate change. We begin with a discussion of economic considerations that are important to take into account when designing and evaluating climate policy, including cost effectiveness and efficiency. We then discuss specific policies at the state, national, and international level in light of these economic considerations.  We have several recommendations for the path forward for climate policy. First, the goal of climate policy should be to reduce the damages caused by greenhouse gases. In addition to mitigation policy to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, one can also reduce the damages causes by greenhouse gases by adaptation measures that reduce our vulnerability to climate change impacts.  Second, policy-makers should use incentive- (or market-) based instruments as opposed to command and control policies (including quantity-based mandates) whenever possible. Whenever unpriced emissions are the sole market failure, incentive-based instruments such as a carbon tax or cap and trade program are more likely to achieve the social optimum and maximize social net benefits [1, 2]. Lin and Prince [3] calculate that the optimal gasoline tax for the state of California is $1.37 per gallon.  Our third recommendation is to address the risk of emissions leakage, which arises when only one jurisdiction (e.g., California) imposes climate policy, but not the entire world. One way to reduce emissions leakage is to use the strategic distribution of emissions allowances to local producers. This method, known as “output-based allocation” or benchmarking, effectively subsidizes local producers and at least partially offsets the increase in their costs caused by an emissions cap [4]. Importantly, only local production is eligible for an allocation of valuable allowances, providing a counterweight to the incentive for emission leakage. Our fourth recommendation is that if they are used instead of incentive-based instruments, quantity-based mandates such as the federal Renewable Fuel Standard, California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard, renewable portfolio standards, and the Clean Power Plan should be combined with a cost containment mechanism. The findings of Lade, Lin Lawell and Smith [5] suggest that pure quantity-based mechanisms leave policies susceptible to large increases in compliance costs, particularly in the presence of capacity or production constraints that are inherent in energy markets. Given the experiences with the federal RFS2 in 2013, anticipating and designing climate policies in a way that can contain compliance costs is imperative.  Our fifth recommendation is that for international leverage, we should develop a climate club backed by border tax adjustments to non-participants. University of California at Berkeley Professor Larry S. Karp has been proposing an agreement between the top 10 emitters as an alternative to the UN framework [6]. Without international leverage or cooperation, unilateral climate policies, such as California’s AB 32 or the American Clean Energy and Security Act, are not only unlikely to fully combat climate change, but can also have other detrimental effects such as the reduction of economic competitiveness and the possible displacement of jobs from the U.S. to countries without carbon pricing [7]. Our final, and main, recommendation is that, as University of California at Berkeley Professor Severin Borenstein points out, California should focus on solving the problem of global climate change. The primary goal of California climate policy should be to invent and develop the technologies that can replace fossil fuels, allowing the poorer nations of the world – where most of the world’s population lives – to achieve low-carbon economic growth [8].","[""abstract""]"

The USREP model tracks nine different income groups and twelve different geographic regions within the U.S. We find that the allocation schemes in all proposals are progressive over the lower half of the income distribution and proportional in the upper half of the income distribution. Scenarios based on the Cantwell-Collins allocation proposal are less progressive in early years and have lower welfare costs due to smaller redistribution to low income households and, consequently, lower income-induced increases in energy demand and less savings and investment. Scenarios based on the three other allocation schemes tend to overcompensate some adversely affected income groups and regions in early years, but this dissipates over time as the allowance allocation effect becomes weaker. Finally, we find that carbon pricing by itself (ignoring the return of carbon revenues through allowance allocations) is proportional to modestly progressive. This striking result follows from the dominance of the sources over uses side impacts of the policy and stands in sharp contrast to previous work that has focused only on the uses side. The main reason is that lower income households derive a large fraction of income from government transfers, and we hold the transfers constant in real terms, reflecting the fact that transfers are generally indexed to inflation. As a result, this source of income is unaffected by carbon pricing while wage and capital income is affected.","[""abstract""]"

Additionally, we also discuss the impacts of CCT-mechanism, consumer environmental awareness (CEA), and the sensitivity of switchovers toward price on the optimal carbon emission reduction rates, retail prices, and manufacturers’ profits. We find that (i) when the carbon quota is not enough, there is a trade off between investing in producing much greener product and purchasing carbon quota; when the carbon price is not high, the manufacturer tends to purchase the carbon quota; and when the carbon price is much higher, the manufacturer is more willing to increase the environmental quality of the product; (ii) manufacturer’s size affects product’s emission reduction rate and manufacturer’s optimal profit; larger manufacturer tends to produce much greener product, but it does not mean that he could obtain much more money than the small manufacturer; and (iii) the decision sequence changes manufacturer’s strategies; the optimal emission reduction rate in Nash and Stackelberg game models are almost the same, but the differences of prices and profits between Nash and Stackelberg model’s are much bigger.","[""abstract""]"

There is mixed evidence for publication bias. Matlab code is used to illustrate key sensitivities of the social cost of carbon; readers can readily run their own analyses. The bulk of the published estimates suggests that carbon dioxide should be taxed somewhere between $20/tC and $400/tC, depending on the preferred rates of discount and risk aversion. Revealed preferences on carbon pricing are at the lower end of this range. The social cost of carbon rises at around 2% per year. The central estimate of the social cost of carbon has not moved much over the last two decades, but the range of estimates is tightening slowly.","[""abstract""]"

This policy brief provides commentary on what the Australian experience with carbon pricing can provide to Canadian industry and policy-makers. As the Canadian government continues to move forward with sector-by-sector regulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and individual provinces continue to implement and strengthen subnational regulatory and pricing mitigation policies, the Australian experience can provide some valuable insight and offer a “parallel universe” to which Canada can compare its own approach to climate change. www.iisd.org © 2012 The International Institute for Sustainable Development POLICY BRIEF NOVEMBER 2012 Divergent Approaches: Greenhouse gas mitigation in Canada and Australia 2 Carbon Policy in Canada and Australia With Australia’s move to address GHG emissions at about the same time that the Government of Canada has moved to regulate, it seems timely for IISD to make comparisons between the two approaches. The comparative size of the two countries’ economies, the prominence of extractive industries and the ongoing political maturation make Australia an interesting case for Canada to observe. In this policy brief, we compare and contrast the issues in more detail. On the surface, Australia’s preference for national carbon pricing is an obvious point of departure from Environment Canada’s preference for performance regulations. However, focusing on where we are today ignores some really interesting insights. Notably, in both countries, the “job-killing carbon tax” rings true for a series of failed politicians who lost their heads over their instrument choice maturations. This political bloodletting will continue to influence federal GHG policy in both countries. While federal politicians in both countries were losing their heads, subnational governments took the lead and implemented policy. As subnational policies matured in Australia, the federal government stepped in to provide a unified approach, and states vacated the policy space. This differs from what we are witnessing in Canada, where the sector-by-sector regulations are now pivoting on provincial equivalency, which could entrench historical policy fragmentation, but allows provinces more direct control over mitigation. The result is that Australian industry is likely to see aligned carbon prices and regulatory requirements across emissions, while there will be no such outcome for their Canadian cousins. Whether this is good or bad remains to be seen. Table 1 provides a comparison of the main elements of the two approaches.

In the face of global inequality and significant vulnerability of asset poor households, I relax the complete markets assumption and introduce a realistic degree of global household inequality. A simple experiment of introducing a range of global carbon taxes, shows a household’s position on the global wealth distribution predicts the identity of their most preferred carbon price. Specifically, poor agents prefer a relatively strong climate change policy. This preference exists even without progressive redistribution of the revenue. However, transfers of the carbon tax revenue is of first order quantitative importance for household policy preference. I find that, parallel to the literature on macroeconomic policy and incomplete markets, the carbon tax can partially fill the role of insurance by reducing the volatility of future welfare. ∗laurence.malafry.ne.su.se","[""abstract""]"

On the island of Sulawesi in the vicinity of the Lore Lindu National Park (LLNP), many smallholders contribute to conversion processes at the forest margin as a result of their agricultural practices. Specifically the area dedicated to cocoa plantations has increased from zero (1979) to nearly 18,000 hectares (2001). Some of these plots have been established inside the 220,000 hectares of the LLNP. An intensification process is observed with a consequent reduction of the shade tree density. This study assesses which impact carbon sequestration payments for forest management systems have on the prevailing land use systems. Additionally, the level of incentives is determined which motivates farmers to desist from further deforestation and land use intensification activities. Household behaviour and resource allocation is analysed with a comparative static linear programming model. As these models prove to be a reliable tool for policy analysis, the output can indicate the adjustments in resource allocation and land use shifts when introducing compensation payments. The data was collected in a household survey in six villages around the LLNP. Four household categories are identified according to their dominant agroforestry systems. These range from low intensity management with a high degree of shading to highly intensified shade free systems. At the plot level, the payments from carbon sequestration are the highest for the full shade cocoa agroforestry system, but with low carbon prices of € 5 tCO2e-1 these constitute 5 percent of the cocoa gross margin. Focusing on the household level, however, an increase of up to 18 percent of the total gross margin can be realised. Furthermore, for differentiated carbon prices up to € 32 tCO2e-1 the majority of the households have an incentive to adopt the more sustainable shade intensive agroforestry system. A win-win situation seems to appear, whereby, when targeting only the shade intensive agroforestry systems with carbon payments, the poorest households economically benefit the most and land use systems with high environmental benefits are promoted.","[""abstract""]"

This paper complements the analysis by Paltsev et al. (2007) of cap-and-trade bills and applies the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model to carry out an analysis of the tax proposals. Several lessons emerge from this analysis. First, a low starting tax rate combined with a low rate of growth in the tax rate will not reduce emissions significantly. Second, the costs of GHG reductions are reduced with the inclusion of non-CO2 gases in the carbon tax scheme. Third, welfare costs of the policies can be affected by the rate of growth of the tax, even after controlling for cumulative emissions. Fourth, a carbon tax -- like any form of carbon pricing -- is regressive. However, general equilibrium considerations suggest that the short-run measured regressivity may be overstated. Additionally, the regressivity can be offset with a carefully designed rebate of some or all of the revenue. Finally, the carbon tax bills that have been proposed or submitted are for the most part comparable to many of the carbon cap-and-trade proposals that have been suggested. Thus the choice between a carbon tax and cap-and-trade system can be made on the basis of considerations other than their effectiveness at reducing emissions over some control period.","[""abstract""]"

Likely leakages under foreseeable carbon prices are estimated to be small and not of an order of magnitude justifying the special allowances sought across a wide spectrum of industries.

A spectrum of options are available to handle this. These options encompass policy instruments that give different weights to ‘command and control’ measures and to economic incentives. We analyze here how to combine an explicit carbon price that rewards mitigation activities every year and a notional price embedded in devices that reward low carbon investments beforehand through lowering their risk-weighted capital costs.The latter option is essential in order to hedge against two uncertainties that adversely affect technologies having high capital costs. The first relates to technologies which are at the beginning or mid-way of their experience curve. The second relates to the net signal launched by explicit carbon prices given the presence of noises that swamp it. We first illustrate, based on five case studies, the equivalence curves between carbon prices and percentages of reduction of capital costs. We argue then that a notional price equated to the SVMA can maximize the economic efficiency of financial devices that reduce the capital costs of a low carbon project and we discuss the necessity of a world SVMA and of national SVMAs. We then introduce uncertainty in the analysis and show that contingent risks theoretically need carbon prices to grow to a level well beyond their political acceptability. Reducing the risk-weighted capital costs and rewarding upfront low-carbon investments at the present value of the SVMA is an efficient way of overcoming these barriers.Finally, we show, in the case of India, how to assess a national SVMA that includes the climate benefits and the development co-benefits of mitigation activities. We then discuss how to articulate a World SVMA (paragraph 108 of the Paris Decision), national SVMAs and explicit carbon prices (in line with NDCs) to bridge the funding gap, tackle the ‘100G$ and +’ issue, and maximize the gains of cooperation around climate policies. 1. Capital costs and switching carbon prices Hirth and Steckel (2017) clearly establish how lowering the capital costs of low-carbon technologies allows for lower switching prices. This can be done through various financial devices (subsidies, public guarantees). One problem is to secure their overall efficiency and hedge against their potential arbitrariness. Let us examine how a notional price based of an SVMA could ensure this.

Thereby coal plants run for shorter periods, and CO2 emissions are reduced. This paper provides a theoretical analysis of fuel switching, in a context where power plants involved are not equally efficient. We begin with some analyses which enable us to observe how differences in the efficiency of power plants impact the cost of fuel switching, and how this is related to the level of switching effort. Based on these preliminary analyses, we build the first partial equilibrium model taking into account the effect of differences in the efficiency of power plants involved in fuel switching. We also investigate the effect of the timing of fuel switching abatements, within the temporally defined environment of our dynamic partial equilibrium model. Results show that the gas price, uncontrolled CO2 emissions and the timing of abatement (through the time of occurrence of random shocks on uncontrolled emissions) act together on the carbon price, and on its relationship with fuel prices..","[""abstract""]"

However, the strength and content of these factors between industrialised and developing countries, where corporate environmentalism is a relatively new phenomenon, is not the same. This paper, therefore, reviews the role of such factors supporting greater adoption of climate change abatement strategies in developing and industrialised countries. This is based on qualitative data collected from industries, NGOs, regulatory bodies and other governmental organisations in Pakistan and the UK. The findings suggest that in the absence of regulatory and societal pressure, the only incentive for organisations is costsavings through energy efficiency projects. However, lack of awareness, non-availability of technology, and high capital cost of the energy-efficient equipment makes this a rather thorny route for Pakistani companies. While in the UK, climate policies concerning industries for instance, EU ETS, do not provide enough incentive to companies to change from ‘business as usual’ because of its short-term outlook, uncertainty, complexity and the generous allocation of allowances, hence very low carbon price.","[""abstract""]"

Therefore, the goal of this paper was to evaluate the effects of carbon prices on trade-offs between forest carbon and timber management objectives in spatial harvest scheduling problems. The objective function of the planning problem was designed to maximize the discounted net present value of harvested timber and the differences of carbon stocks in living tree biomass between the beginning and end of the planning horizon (DoC) within a 30-year time frame for a large forest region in northeast China. The constraints primarily related to maintaining an even flow of harvested timber and guaranteeing the maximum opening size. Forest developments were simulated using a set of standard stand-level growth and yield models, and the solutions of the planning problem were generated using the standard version of a simulated annealing algorithm. The effects of a wide range of carbon prices on the harvested timber and DoC levels were examined. The results showed that the trade-offs between forest harvested timber and the DoC displayed a typical nonlinear tendency as carbon prices increased. The current carbon prices (i.e., 25, 50 and 75 ¥/ton) in China had no significant effects on the optimal forest management plans compared with a scenario that used a carbon price of zero. The minimum carbon price that can provide the financial incentive for the forests to function as a significant carbon sink was estimated to be somewhat over 800 ¥/ton.

In both, electricity generation from solid fuel declines throughout the projection period. This decline is more sharp before 2030 and stabilises thereafter. The relative share of fuels in the electricity generation mix by 2050 is not much different in both scenarios. Solid fuels constitute more than 45 %. The biggest differences were found in gas, nuclear, wind and solar. The differences for nuclear, wind and solar can be explained by the system-wide constraints applied in TIMES-PL. Increased use of gas in PRIMES-REF is presumably more of a methodological nature. CO 2 emissions have a similar, decreasing trend reaching ca. 45 Mt in 2050. In both scenarios ca. 39 % of electricity generated in thermal power plants in 2050 comes from units equipped with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The study confirmed the robustness of the TIMES-PL model and showed that it can be used to provide valuable insights contributing to the development of Polish energy policy.","[""abstract""]"

To investigate the possible transition from conventional electricity to biomass based electricity and its effects on land use and reestablishing natural areas a computable general equilibrium model is introduced. The model and its application to Poland illustrate the trade-off between production of biomass and ‘traditional’ agricultural goods. Three scenarios are presented and compared in context of (a) unilateral policy, and (b) multilateral policy. The results show that the first Polish policy target of achieving a 7.5 percent bioelectricity share in total electricity production can be achieved in all three scenarios. Moreover, for a small reduction of greenhouse gases 10 percent, the emission permit price is around 5 Euro per ton of carbon. This price increases to around 50 Euro per ton of carbon if the emission reduction is increased to 50 percent. Concerning land use allocation, Poland can substantially increase its semi-natural areas. As expected, prices of agricultural commodities increase due to competition for primary resources such as land. If the price of permits is around 30 Euro per ton of carbon, prices of agricultural commodities may rise by about 10 percent.","[""abstract""]"

Incomplete participation and the lack of any enforcing mechanism in IEAs are cited as the reason for the failure climate agreements like Kyoto. Coalition stability literature suggests the use of trade restrictions like border carbon adjustments complementary to climate policy with respect to their potential to generate greater cooperation and serve as enforcement of international environmental agreements. A variety of political, economic and legal reasons have so far prevented any meaningful use of border adjustments in conjunction with IEAs. Therefore, to assess the implications of border adjustments for participation and stability of climate coalitions, I develop a model of multilateral trade extended to climate concerns by way of domestic carbon prices and a border tariff adjustment levied on outsiders to the coalition. The model is solved analytically by allowing players to strategically optimize their carbon pricing decisions with and without the adjustment in a partial cooperation setting. Using the concept of internal and external stability, comparison between scenarios produces the result that a border tariff adjustment levied on imports unambiguously increases participation in the IEA as well as stability of larger coalitions. Further, the imposition of the border measure proves to be both credible and environmentally effective because it increases the welfare of the coalition and the world as a whole as well as reduces emissions by depressing output.","[""abstract""]"

The World Energy Exercise, which integrates an interactive and state-of-the-art computer simulation with a role-playing exercise, opens a social and active learning pathway, which helps students connect their engineering designs with real-world societal relevance. The exercise enables students to control various energy related policy levers that impact global climate change.

Carbon pricing is a real-world consideration, with policies currently enacted and/or under consideration at state, regional, and national levels. Incorporating the World Energy Exercise (created by Climate Interactive and the UMass Lowell Climate Change Initiative) into the senior level thermal fluids systems design course provided many students with an increased understanding and motivation to address the complex social, political and economical issues related to their technical design. The exercise did not change the students’ technical design parameters such as thermal efficiency, but it provided students with an increased appreciation of the societal relevance of this parameter.

As a result of the Global Financial Crisis, both countries were faced with massive fiscal deficits and were forced to curtail their renewable support schemes, although these efforts took several years to take effect after the onset of the initial crisis. Ironically, both Spain and Italy incurred the lion’s share of their liability for renewables support after the onset of the crisis particularly because of the rapid drop in costs of solar PV panels, while subsidy levels remained high. In spite of changes to their support regimes, Italy is likely to meet its 2020 climate and renewable targets, whereas Spain is unlikely to meet its 2020 renewables target based on current trajectories. Following a comparative historical survey of the two large EU member states, we present a scenario analysis that contrasts alternative futures of 2030 where renewable support remain at current levels (essentially zero) or is revived and where carbon prices stay at current low levels (€5/t CO2) or rises to levels needed to accomplish the proposed 40% EU 2030 reduction target. We find that, by 2030, in large parts of Spain, solar PV will be cost-competitive even under low-carbon price and low renewable support regimes, whereas concentrated solar power (CSP) and onshore wind, will require at least either a sustained renewable support regime or a high carbon price to become cost competitive. In Italy, solar PV becomes cost competitive in the low-carbon, low-renewable support scenario except when fossil fuel prices are unusually low. By 2030, there would be large-scale penetration of onshore wind and geothermal in Italy if there is either a high-carbon price or a high renewable support regime or both.

We implement a Least Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) simulation to value the plant, incorporating ramp times, startup costs and variable plant eciency. We take into account that day-ahead prices are settled the day before prices take eect, which is often overlooked in related literature. We nd that ignoring this leads to suboptimal choices and a lower value estimate. An analysis of the regressions in the LSM algorithm reveals that the choice of basis functions has a signicant eect on the estimated value of the plant. Particularly, for a low-eciency plant, a regression on the spark spread underestimates the value by 20% compared to a regression on both the electricity price and the fuel cost components. This implies that in spread option valuations where the LSM is applicable, simulating all asset or commodity prices may be advantageous over simulating the spread alone.","[""abstract""]"

The Biomass Crop Assistance Program and volumetric tax credits for biofuels seek to supplement the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) and provide incentives for producing and blending cellulosic biofuels. This paper examines the effects of these policies on the mix of biofuels produced, food and fuel prices and consumption and GHG emissions as compared to the RFS alone. It also examines the effects of two performance-based policies that target incentives based on the GHG intensity of fuels. We find that the BCAP and volumetric tax credits together lead to biofuel production that exceeds the minimum required by the RFS by 26% and to a significant transition away from corn ethanol and towards cellulosic biofuels. They also reduce GHG emissions by 3% and gasoline consumption by 100 B liters relative to the level with the RFS alone. However, these subsidy policies are costly for the government and for the economy and impose a welfare cost of $122B over the 2007-2022 period. Replacing these payments by subsidies based on carbon credits generated by a feedstock relative to gasoline while less costly does not create significant incentives to change the mix of biofuels beyond the levels mandated by the RFS. In contrast, to these subsidy policies, supplementing the RFS with a $30 per metric ton of CO2e carbon price instrument is found to achieve the 3% reduction in GHG emissions with a gain in social welfare and lower costs to the government relative to the RFS alone.","[""abstract""]"

We also argue that the substantial heterogeneity in abatement cost estimates could be related to an economic interpretation that radial measures reflect the short-run MACs while non-radial measures reflect the long-run MACs. Our mean short-run MAC for carbon is 20 US$ per tonne, an amount that is very close to the carbon prices observed in China's recently launched pilot markets.","[""abstract""]"

With a carbon price, the transition cost can be limited by underutilizing polluting capital, at the expense of a loss in the value of polluting assets (stranded assets) and a drop in income. In contrast, policy instruments that focus on redirecting investments -- such as feebates or environmental standards -- prevent underutilization of existing capital, avoid stranded assets, and reduce short-term losses; but they reduce emissions more slowly and increase the intertemporal cost of the transition.

The qualitative assessment disentangled the different sources and types of uncertainty in the cost-effectiveness analysis of GHG mitigation options. The quantitative assessment estimated the statistical uncertainty of the results by propagating uncertainty through the model, using three uncertainty scenarios. The results show that the uncertainty in the economically optimal abatement in Scottish agricultural soils is high with the medium and high uncertainty scenarios, with the ratio of the 95% CI to the mean being 0.57-1.01 and 0.98-1.4, respectively, while the low uncertainty scenario resulting in a ratio of the 95% CI to the mean of 0.24-0.68.

A key factor affecting the impact of any border taxes is whether they are based on the carbon content of imports or the carbon content in domestic production. Their quantitative estimates suggest that the former action when applied to all merchandise imports would address competitiveness and environmental concerns in high income countries but with serious consequences for trading partners. For example, Chinas manufacturing exports would decline by one-fifth and those of all low and middle income countries by 8 per cent; the corresponding declines in real income would be 3.7 per cent and 2.4 per cent.

Price correlation between power, natural gas and emission allowances as well as their dynamic behaviour is essential for the extent to which cashflows from CCGT plants are self-hedged. Switching between input fuels with different carbon intensities is taken as the fundamental driver of this correlation. Relative marginal power generation costs are used to construct carbon price regimes during which no switching takes place. The regimes are then used as explanatory variables in a dynamic conditional correlation model. Using daily observations of month-ahead prices from April 2005 to August 2010, the results suggest that extreme weather, high commodity market volatility and seasons have no effect on correlation. However, there is evidence of significant price decoupling during periods of extreme relative carbon, coal and natural gas prices.","[""abstract""]"

With an abatement objective in cumulative emissions (e.g., emitting less than 200 GtCO2 in the 2000-2050 period), it makes sense to implement some of the more expensive options before the potential of the cheapest ones has been exhausted. With abatement targets expressed in terms of emissions at one point in time (e.g., reducing emissions by 20 percent in 2020), it can even be preferable to start with the implementation of the most expensive options if their potential is high and their inertia significant. Also, the best strategy to reach a short-term target is different depending on whether this target is the ultimate objective or there is a longer-term target. The best way to achieve Europe's goal of 20 percent reduction in emissions by 2020 is different if this objective is the ultimate objective or if it is only a milestone in a trajectory toward a 75 percent reduction in 2050. The cheapest options may be sufficient to reach the 2020 target but could create a carbon-intensive lock-in and preclude deeper emission reductions by 2050. These results show that in a world without perfect foresight and perfect credibility of the long-term carbon-price signal, a unique carbon price in all sectors is not the most efficient approach.

Increased wind generation, however, would reduce opportunities for price arbitrage and lessen storage revenue. Wind power also affects the way in which devices are operated and changes the characteristics which are rewarded by the market. With increased wind capacity, storage devices cycle less regularly as operation is driven by substantial changes in wind power output, rather than daily demand patterns. As a result, slower discharge times are more favourable and revenue is more sensitive to rates of self-discharge. Furthermore, there is less variation in wholesale electricity price and consequently conversion efficiency is more critical to performance.","[""abstract""]"

Thus, a large order quantity leads to increased efforts to reduce emissions. Results further show that the centralized channel in some cases has fewer emissions and can generate more profits for the whole supply chain compared with the decentralized channel.

However, due to the short establishment time of China’s carbon trading market, the carbon trading price data of the pilot markets were not complete and have the typical characteristics of poor information. The traditional grey correlation model cannot effectively identify the volatility and the grey correlation coefficient of trading data. In this paper, an inscribed cored grey relational analysis model (IC-GRA) is constructed by extracting the values of the triangle inscribed center of the time series sample. Through numerical examples and empirical analysis, it is verified that IC-GRA not only satisfies the four axioms of traditional grey correlation but also avoids the influence of outliers of time series fluctuation and improves the discriminability of the grey correlation coefficient. The empirical results of the IC-GRA model in China’s seven pilot carbon trading markets show that: 1. among international carbon trade factor, the biggest influence factor carbon trade price is different in pilot markets. The price of natural gas has a greater correlation with the carbon price of carbon trading markets in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Chongqing. The futures price of Certified Emission Reduction (CER) has a strong correlation with the carbon price of Shanghai and Beijing carbon trading markets; the price of Hubei carbon trading market is the largest related to crude oil future price in the New York Mercantile Exchange ( NYMEX). 2. Air Quality Index (AQI) is most relevant to the market carbon price of carbon trading, followed by the trading turnover and trading volume of the carbon trading market. Therefore, studying the carbon trading price of the carbon trading market plays a positive role in improving the sustainable development in those areas.","[""abstract""]"

However, whether REDD+ will benefit countries like Nepal, which has a relatively low deforestation rate, less forest cover, and a population predominantly comprising farmers who are heavily dependent on forests, is being debated. To address this issue, the opportunity cost (OC) of REDD+ need to be analyzed. This study analyzes the OC of REDD+ against high-value and mid-value crops in the Thangsa Deurali Community Forest (TDCF) of Dolakha district in the midhills of Nepal. This community forest has been participating in the REDD+ pilot program since 2009. In the study, household survey, focused group discussions, and key informant interviews were used to collect data on community forest management, including forest harvesting and agricultural practices. To estimate the OC, the 2011 guidelines from the World Bank were followed. Potato was taken as a high-value crop, whereas maize and millet were taken as mid-value crops, considering their importance in the study area. The members of TDCF harvest mainly timber, fuel wood, fodder, and leaf litter from the forest’s 217.1 hectares (ha). The OCs of REDD+ will be US$0.072 million/year and US$0.065 million/year for highand mid-value crops, respectively. The carbon prices of US$198 and US$179 per ton will be optimal to cover the possible losses for not moving to highand mid-value crops, respectively, in forestland that can be converted to agricultural land. Co-benefits such as enhancing biodiversity, water recharging, and increasing the role of the forest itself in the farming system could make REDD+ a good choice for managing forests with community participation. The monetary value of such co-benefits is crucial in easing out the optimal carbon price.","[""abstract""]"

However, only a handful of studies exist so far on this important issue that 
are suitable to inform the debate with estimates of carbon stocks and emission

potential emission reductions and removals for a 35-year period under the REDD+ 
scheme. We start by developing land use change and forest harvesting models 
that are used to estimate carbon stock changes in natural forests and forest 
plantations in Southeast Asia. Carbon emissions from deforestation and forest 
degradation of natural forests were 1865.1, 1611.4, and 1300.4 TgCO2 year-1, respectively. With 
a hypothetical carbon project of 35 years beginning from 2015, carbon emission 
reductions were estimated at 817.6 TgCO2 year-1, of which about 10% 
was from reducing forest degradation. Carbon removals due to increase of forest 
plantations were 76.3 TgCO2 year-1 but 
the removals could be much higher if there is a new definition on the 
eligibility of forest plantations. Summing up together, about 893.9 TgCO2 of carbon credits could be achieved 
from implementing carbon project in Southeast Asia or about US $6.6 billion 
annually between 2015 and 2050 if carbon price in 2012 is used. In addition to 
reducing emissions, there are other benefits from carbon project 
implementation. This study suggests that REDD+ has great potential for reducing 
carbon emissions and enhancing carbon stocks in the forests. Without financial 
incentives, carbon project would not happen and therefore climate change will

This paper analyzes the effects of linking Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) to a global market for greenhouse gas emission reductions. We supplement a global climate-energy-economy model with alternative cost estimates for reducing deforestation emissions in order to examine a global program for stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations at 550 ppmv of CO2 equivalent. Introducing REDD reduces global forestry emissions through 2050 by 20-22% in the Brazil-only case and by 64-88% in the global REDD scenarios. At the same time, REDD lowers the total costs of the climate policy by an estimated 10-25% depending on which tropical countries participate and whether the “banking” of excess credits for use in future periods is allowed. As a result, REDD could enable additional reductions of at least 20 ppmv of CO2-equivalent concentrations with no added costs compared to an energy-sector only policy. The cost savings from REDD are magnified if banking is allowed and there is a need to increase the stringency of global climate policy in the future in response, for example, to new scientific information. Results also indicate that REDD decreases carbon prices in 2050 by 8-23% with banking and 11-26% without banking. While developing regions, particularly Latin America, gain the value of REDD opportunities, the decrease in the carbon price keeps the value of international carbon market flows relatively stable despite an increase in volumes transacted. We also estimate that REDD generally reduces the total portfolio of investments and research and development of new energy technologies by 1-10%. However, due to impacts on the relative prices of different fossil fuels, REDD has a slight positive estimated effect on investments in coal-related technologies (IGCC and CCS) as well as, in some cases, non-electric energy R&D. This research confirms that integrating REDD into global carbon markets can provide powerful incentives for the preservation of tropical forests while lowering the costs of global climate change protection and providing valuable policy flexibility.","[""abstract""]"

For incremental emission reductions on the margin, this static perspective may be correct, expressing the ability of carbon pricing to identify and spur abatement options with the lowest cost. At the same time, meeting the 1.5°C target requires achievement of zero net emissions in the relatively near term, implying a need for full decarbonisation rather than marginal abatement. To date, there is only limited empirical evidence suggesting that carbon pricing has produced deep emission cuts. Emission reductions triggered by carbon taxes and emissions trading systems are typically modest or relate to a baseline rather than absolute levels, even in cases where price levels are relatively high. Consequently, we posit that deep decarbonisation in line with the 1.5°C target can only be ensured by drawing on a portfolio approach, in which carbon pricing operates alongside other instruments including regulation and legal mandates.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Biofuels are being promoted to increase energy security and reduce GHG emissions through policies that establish mandates for blending biofuels with liquid fossil fuels and by setting standards for the reduction in the GHG intensity of transportation fuel. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) established by the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, sets quantity mandates for blending specific types of biofuels (based on their life-cycle GHG intensity) with fossil fuels. Although not initiated as a low-carbon fuel policy, it does seek to promote low carbon advanced biofuels and mitigate GHG emissions. It requires blending at least 136 billion (B) liters of biofuels (ethanol energy equivalence) with liquid fossil fuels by 2022; this would represent a five-fold increase in US biofuel consumption compared to that in 2007. A low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG intensity of transportation fuels by 2020 is being implemented in California (California Air Resources Board [CARB], 2009), and is being considered by several other states and at the national level. In contrast to these policies that indirectly seek to reduce GHG emissions, a carbon price policy could be established to create direct incentives to substitute low carbon fuels for fossil fuels. Biofuels can affect GHG emissions in three ways. First, they can displace an energy-equivalent amount of fossil fuels; second, they can affect fossil fuel consumption by affecting fuel price; and third, they can have an indirect effect on land use, which results in a release of carbon stored in soils and vegetation. The first (displacement) effect directly reduces GHG emissions by substituting energy-equivalent amount of biofuels for fossil fuels. The second (rebound or market-mediated) effect arises because any unilateral low-carbon policy that reduces demand for fossil fuels by a large country such as the United States will lead to a reduction in the demand for oil in the world oil market and, thus, global fuel prices.1 The third indirect land use change (ILUC) effect is caused by the adverse effect of biofuels production on food prices and resulting expansion of cropland on carbon-rich non-agricultural land in the rest of the world (ROW; see Khanna & Crago, forthcoming; Khanna, Crago, & Black, 2011).

We synthesize findings regarding the use of carbon revenues both from recent behavioral and political studies as well as from economic analyses of equity and efficiency. We then compare real-world carbon pricing regimes with insights derived from theory. We find that uniform lump-sum recycling of carbon revenues to citizens is favored among behavioral and political studies that emphasize the importance of distributional fairness, revenue salience, political trust, and policy stability amid partisan changes in government. It is also successfully employed in several real-world recycling schemes, although alternative uses of revenues such as green spending may be appropriate in different national contexts.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

However, globalization drives concerns about unilateral actions. In particular, preservation of the competitiveness of energy-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) industries and the risk of carbon leakage in the case of asymmetric action still represent a barrier that must be lifted. Although the value-added of these industries represents a small fraction of the industrialized countries' GDP, their production remains highly strategic, and the power of industrial lobbies has proven to be decisive regarding any attempt to implement ambitious environmental taxation or quantitative control of greenhouse gas emissions. 
Depending on how the tax revenues are used, unilateral carbon tax represents a great potential of action to appropriately balance macroeconomic, equity and competitiveness concerns. Numerous studies, based on either partial equilibrium models or computable general equilibrium models (CGE), examined the impact of alternative policy design on competitiveness and leakage issues. One the one hand, partial equilibrium models bring high details on some keys EITE sectors (in particular cement and steel sectors) and use relevant empirical information to analyse specific competitiveness constraints facing by those sectors. On the other hand, CGE models often embark poor details on EITE sectors, as by representing the economic system in a more aggregated way. However, CGE models reveal all feedback effects on the economy, and therefore can be used to estimate both industry and economy-wide effects 
The paper proposes a method to keep benefits from both sectorial and general equilibrium analysis. This method has originally been developed to build a hybrid Input-Output Table (IOT) at a regional. The approach consists in combining economic and physical data from sectors analysis with monetary input-output data from national accounts within a consistent and comprehensive ""hybrid"" accounting system. We analyse the effects of a unilateral French carbon tax reform using a country-scale CGE model. In order to analyse disaggregation consequences, the model is calibrated either on IOT with aggregated mineral and metal sectors, or on an hybrid IOT which isolates cement from other minerals, and steel and iron from other metals. Finally, we proceed to comparative static exercises by implementing a unilateral carbon tax and compare the macroeconomic and distributive effects of policy options regarding the use of carbon tax revenues. 
The numerical results show that the macroeconomic outcomes of a carbon tax are very sensitive to policy design but much less to the level of sectorial description on which the model is calibrated. However, keeping aggregated heterogeneous industrial sectors can be misleading when exploring distributive consequences of a carbon price policy. Lowering the labour tax with the carbon tax revenue preserve most of economic activities, and leads to better macroeconomic outcomes. However, it is not enough to avoid important profitability losses for major industrial stakeholders. Some accompanying measures are expected to preserve these industries and to reconcile competitiveness issues with macroeconomic efficiency.","[""abstract""]"

However, capturing this changing role through national-based analyses is challenging due to the global nature of fossil fuel demand and resulting trade patterns. This article sets out the limitations of existing national-scale decarbonization analyses in adequately capturing global conditions and explores how the introduction of a global modelling framework could provide vital insights, particularly for those countries that are dependent on fossil fuel exports or imports. The article shows that fossil fuel use will significantly decline by 2050, although gas will have an important transition role. This leaves large fossil fuel exporters exposed, the extent of which is determined by mitigation action in different regions and especially by the pathways adopted by the larger Asian economies. We find that global-scale models provide critical insights that complement the more detailed national analyses and should play a stronger role in informing deep decarbonization pathways (DDPs). They also provide an important basis for exploring key uncertainties around technology uptake, mitigation rates and how this plays out in the demand for fossil fuels. However, use of global models also calls for improved representation of country specifics in global models, which can oversimplify national economic and political realities. Using both model scales provides important insights that are complementary but that can challenge the other’s orthodoxy. However, neither can replace the other’s strengths. Policy relevance: In recent years, how global fossil fuel markets will evolve under different climate regimes has been subject to much debate and analysis. This debate includes whether investments in fossil fuel production still make sense or will be exposed in the future to liabilities associated with high carbon prices. This is important for governments who need to develop coherent policy in relation to fossil fuel sectors and their role as drivers of economic growth and in providing for domestic energy needs. This article argues that national analyses need to be fully cognizant of the global-scale transition, which can be informed by using a multi-scale modelling approach.","[""abstract""]"

Putting a price on carbon emissions is an important step towards climate change mitigation. A cap and trade system is one of the ways to create a carbon price. The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZETS) is the world’s first economy-wide cap and trade system that covers all sectors and all 6 greenhouse gases. Forestry is a major part of the NZETS, allowing foresters to earn carbon credits for new forests planted on and after 1st January 1990 (afforestation and reforestation). At the same time, the NZETS also makes foresters liable for harvesting new forests planted on and after 1st January 1990, and deforesting forests existing on and before 31st December 1989. In this paper, we perform an economic analysis of how a carbon price will likely affect the returns and forestry management behaviour in new forests in New Zealand. Previous works have used the NPV/LEV (fixed harvesting) analysis where the forest is assumed to be harvested (in future) at the estimated optimal rotation age regardless of timber prices at that time. Other works have employed the Real Options approaches (flexible harvesting) where sophisticated models such as Partial Differential Equations and simulations analyse the effects of bringing forward the harvest decision if timber prices are favourable, and deferring the harvest decision if timber prices are unfavourable. Often, these methods tend to have higher data requirements, employ different assumptions and are much more complex to estimate. Because of these differences, it may be difficult to compare the results of NPV/LEV analysis with Real Options. Our work here applies the binomial tree method, which is a relatively simple method that can generate both LEV (fixed harvesting) and Real Options (flexible harvesting) results on a common model with the same data requirements and assumptions. This allows for better comparability of forestry management behaviour and effects of carbon price. The forestry valuations are analysed under a stochastic timber price and a constant carbon price.

Policies constraining or penalizing carbon emissions can significantly impact the capacity planning decisions of both fossil-fueled and renewable generators. Uncertainties due to intermittency of various renewable generators can also affect the carbon emission policies. This paper proposes a Cournot-based long-term capacity expansion model taking into account carbon cap constraint for a partly concentrated electricity market dealing with stochastic renewables using a Bayesian game. The stochastic game is formulated as a centralized convex optimization problem and solved to obtain a Bayes-Nash Equilibrium (Bayes-NE) point. The stochastic nature of a generic electricity market is illustrated with a set of scenarios for wind availability, in which three generation firms (coal, gas, and wind) decide on their generation and long-term capacity investment strategies. Carbon price is derived as the dual variable of the carbon cap constraint. Embedding the carbon cap constraint in the game indicates more investment on renewable generators and less on fossil-fueled power plants. However, the higher level of intermittency from renewable generation leads to a higher carbon price to meet the cap constraint. This paves the way towards storage technologies and diversification of distributed generation as means to encounter intermittency in renewable generation.","[""abstract""]"

That means that CCS must deliver consistent environmental and social benefits which exceed its costs of capital, energy and operation; it must be protective of the environment and human health over the long term; and it must be suitable for deployment on a significant scale. CCS is one of the more expensive and technically challenging carbon emissions abatement options available, and CCS must first and foremost be considered in the context of the other things that can be done to reduce emissions, as a part of an overall optimally efficient, sustainable and economic mitigation plan. This elevates the analysis beyond a simple comparison of the cost per tonne of CO2 abated—there are inherent tradeoffs with a range of other factors (such as water, NOx, SOx, biodiversity, energy, and human health and safety, among others) which must also be considered if we are to achieve truly sustainable mitigation. The full life-cycle cost of CCS must be considered in the context of the overall social, environmental and economic benefits which it creates, and the costs associated with environmental and social risks it presents. Such analysis reveals that all CCS is not created equal. There is a wide range of technological options available which can be used in a variety of industries and applications—indeed CCS is not applicable to every industry. Stationary fossil-fuel powered energy and large scale petroleum industry operations are two examples of industries which could benefit from CCS. Capturing and geo-sequestering CO2 entrained in natural gas can be economic and sustainable at relatively low carbon prices, and in many jurisdictions makes financial sense for operators to deploy now, if suitable secure disposal reservoirs are available close by. Retrofitting existing coal-fired power plants, however, is more expensive and technically challenging, and the economic sustainability of post-combustion capture retrofit needs to be compared on a portfolio basis to the relative overall net benefit of CCS on new-build plants, where energy efficiency can be optimised as a first step, and locations can be selected with sequestration sites in mind. Examples from the natural gas processing, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and coal-fired power generation sectors, illustrate that there is currently a wide range of financial costs for CCS, depending on how and where it is applied, but equally, environmental and social benefits of emissions reduction can be considerable. Some CCS applications are far more economic and sustainable than others. CCS must be considered in the context of the other things that a business can do to eliminate emissions, such as far-reaching efforts to improve energy efficiency.","[""abstract""]"

Given that a BCA is a trade measure, it might cause disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO). If the BCA is considered illegal, the losses suffered by some partners may justify trade retaliations. At that point, it would be likely that prohibitive retaliatory tariffs target sensitive products in the EU, which are often related to the European agricultural sector. These trade measures would limit the drop in production in the energy-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) sectors, but at the expense of the other sectors.

agriculture, like all other sectors, will have to contribute to efforts in achieving net negative emissions 
by the end of the century. Cost-efficient distribution of mitigation across regions and economic 
sectors is typically calculated using a global uniform carbon price in climate stabilization scenarios. 
However, in reality such a carbon price would substantially affect food availability. Here, we assess the 
implications of climate changemitigation in the land use sector for agricultural production and food 
security using an integrated partial equilibrium modelling framework and explore ways of relaxing the 
competition between mitigation in agriculture and food availability. Using a scenario that limits 
global warming cost-efficiently across sectors to 1.5 ◦C, results indicate global food calorie losses 
ranging from 110–285 kcal per capita per day in 2050 depending on the applied demand elasticities. 
This could translate into a rise in undernourishment of 80–300 million people in 2050. Less ambitious 
greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in the land use sector reduces the associated food security impact 
significantly, however the 1.5 ◦C target would not be achieved without additional reductions outside 
the land use sector. Efficiency of GHG mitigation will also depend on the level of participation 
globally. Our results show that if non-Annex-I countries decide not to contribute to mitigation action 
while other parties pursue their mitigation efforts to reach the global climate target, food security 
impacts in these non-Annex-I countries will be higher than if they participate in a global agreement, 
as inefficient mitigation increases agricultural production costs and therefore food prices. Land-rich 
countries with a high proportion of emissions from land use change, such as Brazil, could reduce 
emissions with only a marginal effect on food availability. In contrast, agricultural mitigation in high 
population (density) countries, such as China and India, would lead to substantial food calorie loss 
without a major contribution to global GHG mitigation. Increasing soil carbon sequestration on 
agricultural land would allow reducing the implied calorie loss by 65% when sticking to the initially 
estimated land use mitigation requirements, thereby limiting the impact on undernourishment to 
20–75 million people, and storing significant amounts of carbon in soils.","[""abstract""]"

Answering this question requires an in-depth analysis of emissions trading schemes, RES and EUEE investment criteria, market dynamics, and inertia in the energy system as well as the climate system and its sensitivity to GHG stabilization levels, among other things. Because this is a task too ambitious within the scope of the current paper, we narrow the discussion to analysis of currently applied emissions trading schemes, notably the EU Emissions Trading System and provide our observations related to this question. Marketbased instruments (MBIs) that foster sustainability in the energy sector have been introduced to promote electricity from renewable energy sources and cut harmful emissions. Quota systems coupled with tradable green certificates have been developed and tested in several European countries and some states in the US. Another widely analysed MBI is the tradable emission allowance; the first international CO2 emissions trading system is starting in the European Union. This paper explains the concepts of emissions trading, and of the policy instruments that involve green and white certificates. It discusses the effect of emissions trading on EUEE and RES and the conditions, including design specifics that may hamper or facilitate the wider introduction of EUEE and RES projects. Finally, the paper reviews the desirability and practicality of integration of green and white certificates and their introduction in emission trading. Emissions Trading: Concept, Implementation and Impacts on EUEE and RES An emissions trading scheme creates a market for emission allowances and in principle enables emission reductions to take place where it is most cost effective. In the European Union (EU) the Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) has commenced in January 2005; in the U.S. some states discuss regional trading. In 2003 the EU adopted a Directive (2003/87/EC) introducing a cap-and-trade scheme within the Community. The EU ETS is the first trans-national emissions trading scheme; it is supposed to cover about 46 % of the EU-15’s total CO2 emissions in 2010 (the first three-year trading period 2005-2007 is limited only to CO2) and involves about 12,000 installations that fall 1 We recognize the difference between policy instruments that harness market forces to achieve a certain policy goal (such as renewable energy quotas or renewable portfolio standards) and the market instruments themselves (namely carbon allowances, green and white certificates) the latter being a much narrower concept representing just a tradable commodity. This differentiation is not so important in the context of the present paper and in the text we refer to complex policy tools/portfolios that include trading of financial commodities (such as certificates or allowances) as market-based instruments (MBIs). under the activities specified in Annex I of the Directive: practically all energy intensive sectors (apart from the chemical sector). Each installation gets emission allowances for the whole period: allowances are allocated to installations covered by the scheme by the Member States of the EU by means of a national allocation plan (NAP) and according to defined criteria. For the first period emission allowances are free of charge and allocation is based on the grandfathering method; for the second period (2008-2012) Member States can auction up to 10 % of their total emission allowances. In the US, the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI or ""ReGGIe"") is a cooperative effort by nine Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states to discuss the design of a regional cap-and-trade program initially covering CO2 emissions from power plants in the region. In the future, RGGI may be extended to include other sources of GHG emissions, and GHGs other than CO2. Meanwhile, states are taking action to solidify their climate policy and require mandatory reporting of GHGs – a first step towards emissions trading. Private initiatives have also emerged to allow for voluntary target setting by firms, reporting of GHG emissions, and trading. Caveats of Emissions Trading There a number of reasons why emission trading by itself, especially as currently applied in the EU ETS, is insufficient to stimulate EUEE and RES. First, emissions trading will stimulate RES and EUEE only after all cheaper options are taken up by the market. We expect that direct ‘competition’ of EUEE and RES projects against other carbon saving options in the EU ETS will result in the additional deployment of a limited number of EUEE and RES projects. For renewables this is because: (1) Renewables may have higher marginal abatement costs than other carbon mitigation options; (2) So far the allowance prices in the EU ETS are anticipated to be low and the carbon price is very much fluctuating; (3) Markets are indifferent towards the direction of technological change (this is valid for MBIs in general rather than for EU ETS solely). 2 Grandfathering is a method of distributing emissions allowances for free using only historical data. This method has been provided for by the Directive and taken as the basis for preparation of the national allocation plan. Projections of emissions for the three-year trading period of 2005-2007 are calculated from previous periods. 3 See: www.rggi.org/about.htm 4 Currently, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Vermont are participating in the RGGI effort. In addition, Maryland, the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, the Eastern Canadian Provinces and New Brunswick are observers in the process. 5 See: http://www.chicagoclimatex.com/about/ 6 We recognize that there is a profound difference between emission trading as defined in UNFCCC and the EU ETS and the latter is much more limited. Here we describe the practical concerns related to the EU ETS. We refer to energy efficiency and RE projects that are not covered by the ETS, i.e. not undertaken by operators under the CO2 cap in EU ETS. 7 Following a bearish start in early Jan 2005, seeing allowance prices drop to Euro 6.35/t for delivery in 2005 (EUA 2005), prices in the EU ETS have since climbed steadily. Late April 2005 saw allowance prices for delivery in 2005 reaching a preliminary all-time high of Euro 17.90/t (www.pointcarbon.com). Some attribute these price increases to the gas-coal spread, cold weather across Europe and discussion on cuts of emission allowances in i.e. the UK, the Czech Republic and Poland insisted by the European Commission. The price of the EU allowance has also been said to track German power price spikes in recent months. On the other hand, EUEE is a low-cost carbon mitigation option. However, there is the risk that not many EUEE projects will enter the ETS because: (1) EUEE is ‘invisible’: businesses may not recognize it as an energy source, business opportunity and a way to improve competitiveness and comfort; and (2) Power generators obliged under the EU ETS are more likely to take measures at the supply side where their area of expertise is. In this sense an indicative gradation of their preferences would be to first improve the efficiency of plants (rehabilitation and/or fuel switch), then to install renewable electricity generation capacity, and only last to look beyond the consumer’s meter. Second, the direct (upstream) approach applied in the EU ETS only indirectly gives a minor incentive to energy savings and RES as a means to consume less carbon intensive products. This has a double negative impact. Principally because only direct emissions are accounted for, an industrial user with an emission cap under EU ETS may not get any carbon benefit for reducing electricity consumption on-site, which may give a wrong incentive to electricity end-use options (motors/drives, lighting) and may result in a shift from thermal energy to electricity. In addition, while under the direct approach the cost of the permits will be accounted for in the price of the products sold by emitters – products with high carbon content will become more expensive and buyers may respond by consuming less or switching to an alternative with a less significant price rise (which presumably, but not certainly, is also less carbon intensive) – price differences between product alternatives are not only caused by carbon intensity. A recent report to the UK Department of Trade and Industry has estimated the potential impact of the first phase of the EU ETS on electricity prices in ten European countries. The report states “full marginal cost pass-through of carbon into electricity prices equates to an increase of 0.33 to 0.64 p/kWh depending on the country and year. However the direct generation market cost – incurred by generators having to purchase extra allowances – will be less than one tenth as much on average, i.e. well below 0.1 p/kWh” (ILEX/Electrowatt-Ekono 2004). This will not make renewable electricity projects much more attractive. The report concludes that the introduction of the EU ETS will “put upward pressure on wholesale electricity 8 Emission trading will only evoke innovations when these bring extra rent to the obliged parties. 9 The direct (upstream) approach is based on the physical source (‘the pipe’), whereby the actual emitters are obliged to purchase sufficient emission permits. In contrast, the indirect (downstream) approach is based on the idea that the final users, who are causing the whole production chain, should see more precisely what the carbon intensity is, and get allotted emission quota based on a baseline. The EU ETS follows the direct system, among other things because of the monitoring and inspection complications inherent to the indirect scheme, especially at an international scale. 10 The method of allowance all","[""abstract""]"

Discarded at the 2009 COP in Copenhagen, it remained part of deliberations for a climate agreement in subsequent years. As there is still much misunderstanding about the many reasons to implement a global carbon price, ideological resistance against it prospers. Here, we present the main arguments for carbon pricing, to stimulate a fair and well‐informed discussion about it. These include considerations that have received little attention so far. We stress that a main reason to use carbon pricing is environmental effectiveness at a relatively low cost, which in turn contributes to enhance social and political acceptability of climate policy. This includes the property that corrected prices stimulate rapid environmental innovations. These arguments are underappreciated in the public debate, where pricing is frequently downplayed and the erroneous view that innovation policies are sufficient is widespread. Carbon pricing and technology policies are, though, largely complementary and thus are both needed for effective climate policy. We also comment on the complementarity of other instruments to carbon pricing. We further discuss distributional consequences of carbon pricing and present suggestions on how to address these. Other political economy issues that receive attention are lobbying, co‐benefits, international policy coordination, motivational crowding in/out, and long‐term commitment. The overview ends with reflections on implementing a global carbon price, whether through a carbon tax or emissions trading. The discussion goes beyond traditional arguments from environmental economics by including relevant insights from energy research and innovation studies as well.

Levelised costs are used by project developers and investors/funders in determining which projects to develop or invest in. They are often used by policy makers in comparing the relative merits of different power generation technologies, particularly renewable energy technologies. However, in this respect, the use of levelised cost as a comparator undervalues the benefits of geothermal energy projects as it does not recognize the important benefit that geothermal energy projects have over most other renewable technologies, such as providing base load power and protection against possible future fuel price increases or carbon cost imposts. As such, geothermal energy is often undervalued by policy makers and investors leading to the potential for ill informed decision making and inappropriate investment decisions. This paper describes and proposes an alternative to use of levelised costs to value geothermal project options compared to other, intermittent, renewable energy and other fossil fuel technologies, using the GENCHOICE framework. This framework captures the benefits of geothermal energy as being base load, a major contributor to carbon emissions reduction and an efficient user of the electricity grid. The framework measures levelised cost at a common point of comparison, in this case the regional reference nodes. The levelised cost is estimated as a function of capacity utilisation and explicitly includes system costs as a function of intermittency, in addition to breaking down capital and operating costs into major components. The framework also uses a probabilistic approach to provide a value for the hedge against future fuel and carbon price rises. The approach has been used to determine the advantages of geothermal relative to other fossil fuel and renewable technologies and suggests that the cost difference is much narrower when all these other factors are taken into account. Further, the risks associated with geothermal technologies are also less compared to many other generation technologies. Once these additional factors are taken into account, the differential narrow between the cost of geothermal generation and the cost of other forms of renewable and fossil fuel generation. The approach has implications for both investors and policy makers. Investors need to be cognisant of the relative advantages of alternative generation technologies and the added benefits that differing technologies including geothermal can bring to their portfolio. Policy makers need to be aware that basing policies on simplified levelised cost calculations may lock in the use of technologies that do not minimise electricity generation costs in the long term. The approach also provides guidance on which aspect of the technology would benefit from further research and development. It is clear that further works on firming up the geothermal resource base and to improve the efficiency of the energy conversion process would go a long way to reducing costs of geothermal and lock in its comparative advantage to other renewable technologies.","[""abstract""]"

Short-Sighted Households and the Timing of Consumption Taxes","2010","2","Many forms of consumption tax, including recent proposals to impose a tax on the use of carbon, impose disproportionate burdens on the poor. Commentators who propose mitigating this impact with tax rebates for low-income families have overlooked the importance of the timing of consumption for these households, as well as the difficulties of “smoothing” income from one time period to another. We survey a wide array of evidence suggesting that poor households lack affordable mechanisms for both borrowing and saving, such that a lump-sum rebate, or even monthly rebates, would not leave the household as well off as they were in the absence of any tax. In addition, we show that the cognitive features of a rebate will be problematic for short-sighted households - those who heavily favor the present over the future. For example, they may impatiently spend rebates too quickly, leaving little money for later necessities, and potentially increasing overall carbon usage. And they likely will procrastinate both learning how to overcome these problems, as well as putting off investing in less carbon-intensive goods. We do not, however, argue against carbon pricing. Instead, we offer new methods of structuring taxes and rebates to overcome these problems. For instance, we suggest that rebates be offered on a “self-directed” debit card, subject to a sticky default cap on weekly withdrawals. This implement “nudges” short-sighted households away from impatience, while offering affordable credit and modern banking to all. These same mechanisms can be used for other forms of transactional consumption taxes, such as state sales taxes or a possible national value-added tax.","[""abstract""]"

It provides backward-compatibility with the Kyoto Protocol by allowing un-modified cap and trade as one form of national carbon pricing. Instead of many national “caps,” the proposal sets a global target price for carbon and specifies a pair of incentives. A Pricing Incentive rewards nations that set their carbon price higher than the global target and penalizes nations that underachieve. These rewards and penalties sum to zero by design. The strength of the Pricing Incentive is adjusted automatically so that the global average carbon price converges to the global target price. A Clean Development Incentive (CDI), free from the gaming problems that plague the U.N.’s Clean Development Mechanism, encourages full participation by low-emission countries. An example, based on a $20 price target, causes transfers from the United States of only seven cents per capita per day. Nevertheless, India’s CDI receipts cover its compliance costs.

In order to simultaneously consider cost, customer satisfaction, and carbon emissions in the cold chain logistics path optimization problem, based on the idea of cost–benefit, this paper proposes a comprehensive cold chain vehicle routing problem optimization model with the objective function of minimizing the cost of unit satisfied customer. For customer satisfaction, this paper uses the punctuality of delivery as the evaluation standard. For carbon emissions, this paper introduces the carbon trading mechanism to calculate carbon emissions costs. An actual case data is used with a cycle evolutionary genetic algorithm to carry out computational experiments in the model. First, the effectiveness of the algorithm and model were verified by a numerical comparison experiment. The optimization results of the model show that increasing the total cost by a small amount can greatly improve average customer satisfaction, thereby obtaining a highly cost-effective solution. Second, the impact of carbon price on total costs, carbon emissions, and average customer satisfaction have also been numerically analyzed. The experimental results show that as carbon price increases, there are two opposite trends in total costs, depending on whether carbon quota is sufficient. Increasing carbon price within a certain range can effectively reduce carbon emissions, but at the same time it will reduce average customer satisfaction to a certain extent; there is a trade-off between carbon emissions and customer satisfaction. This model enriches the optimization research of cold chain logistics distribution, and the study results complement the impact research of carbon price on carbon emissions and customer satisfaction.

The proposed model aims to determine the optimal operation strategy for the given system with the consideration of wind power curtailment and reservation and also the environmental aspect, especially the carbon price of greenhouse gases (GHG) and emission limits of decarbonization scenarios. From 2 case studies, increasing the carbon price at a low emission limit leads to an increase in the total cost, but the rate of the increase is mitigated on decreasing the emission limits. Moreover, dispatch is dominated by the carbon price at high emission allowance levels and by the emission allowance at low emission allowances.","[""abstract""]"

The European Union aims at reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% compared to 1990 by 2050. The technological and organizational changes necessary over time to reach this target are yet widely unknown today, and so are the associated costs. For theses transformations to be organized and economically efficient over time, the use of a carbon price signal is crucial in order to influence the operational and investment decisions of actors throughout the economy. The risk of a continuing faint price signal is that Europe will then have to engage in a more costly emission trajectory, because of carbon lock-in and uncoordinated policies. To fully play its role, the price signal must be politically robust from the short to the long term. The value of emissions allowances relies on the credibility of the emission constraint over time. Surplus allowances are frequently observed in allowance markets, but they can co-exist with high prices. As observed in the US SO2 market (see Figure 1) and Phase 1 of the EU ETS, surplus allowances are used by participants for banking, and are not a flaw in the system, provided that banking is permitted and that the longer term constraints are anticipated as quantitatively ambitious and politically credible. The currently low level of the EU carbon price is due to (1) the fact that EU ETS emissions are on line with the explicit reduction target of 2020, and (2) the fact that the longer term ambition of the policy is still widely unclear, both quantitatively and politically. The justification for any market intervention is important, as it determines the possibility and nature of future interventions, and shapes the market's expectations of such changes. It will always be difficult to determine the precise cause of declining EU ETS emissions. As acknowledged in the report, an important share of the required internal reductions can be due to external factors (economic cycles, use of carbon offsets, overlap with other European or unilateral national policies). The sectoral, geographical and temporal effects of those external factors are difficult to anticipate, and will surely keep arising in the future. As a consequence, "" one-shot "" intervention would not restore the robustness of the carbon signal, and a deeper reform is needed to sustainably restore the carbon price …","[""abstract""]"

Both challenges must be met while reducing the impact of land management on ecosystem services that deliver vital goods and services, and support human health and well‐being. Few studies to date have considered the interactions between these challenges. In this study we briefly outline the challenges, review the supply‐ and demand‐side climate mitigation potential available in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use AFOLU sector and options for delivering food security. We briefly outline some of the synergies and trade‐offs afforded by mitigation practices, before presenting an assessment of the mitigation potential possible in the AFOLU sector under possible future scenarios in which demand‐side measures codeliver to aid food security. We conclude that while supply‐side mitigation measures, such as changes in land management, might either enhance or negatively impact food security, demand‐side mitigation measures, such as reduced waste or demand for livestock products, should benefit both food security and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Demand‐side measures offer a greater potential (1.5–15.6 Gt CO2‐eq. yr−1) in meeting both challenges than do supply‐side measures (1.5–4.3 Gt CO2‐eq. yr−1 at carbon prices between 20 and 100 US$ tCO2‐eq. yr−1), but given the enormity of challenges, all options need to be considered. Supply‐side measures should be implemented immediately, focussing on those that allow the production of more agricultural product per unit of input. For demand‐side measures, given the difficulties in their implementation and lag in their effectiveness, policy should be introduced quickly, and should aim to codeliver to other policy agenda, such as improving environmental quality or improving dietary health. These problems facing humanity in the 21st Century are extremely challenging, and policy that addresses multiple objectives is required now more than ever.","[""abstract""]"

This newsletter contains interesting materials for those who think about the question how to proceed with forests and climate change after Copenhagen, with or without an agreement. Here below are presented some observations from this newsletter: • Adaptation and mitigation are separate issues in the climate discussions, but in forest practice they are two sides of the same coin. • We need forest management directed at the realization of different objectives at the same time, we do not need pure ‘carbon forests’. Not addressing ‘people’ and ‘planet’ considerations is increasingly seen – by both the public and private sector – as a business risk. • Not all countries will be able to comply with REDD rules in the short term. The voluntary carbon market will remain important. • REDD is an opportunity and a risk for local communities. Risks should be made transparent, and open and equal participation by communities in design and decision-making should be promoted • REDD and other forest-based climate change mitigation measures are likely to be low-cost and effective in the short to medium term. Some stakeholders fear that forests may become a too-cheap mitigation option and corrupt the overall climate agreement. In most calculations, however, the costs of developing, operating and managing the institutional system required to produce credible and sustainable forest carbon credits are not internalized in forest carbon prices. If they were, forest carbon prices would become much higher and more realistic. • The role of forests must be clarified and articulated in National Adaptation Programs of Action (NAPAs). At present most political attention and financing is focused on REDD, and, in general, on climate mitigation. Only recently has the concern for the role of forests in adaptation gained ground; this emanates from the growing recognition that climate change will happen anyway. Moreover, climate change will affect the most vulnerable ecosystems and poorer regions. • There is a clear need for harmonization and coherence in the certification market (SFM, and carbon, fair trade etc.). Certification is not necessarily the only credible basis for payment. As illustrated in this issue, mutual trust can be an alternative, particularly for small-scale initiatives that cannot afford the high transaction costs of certification.","[""abstract""]"

Building on simulations using Integrated Assessment Models and historical evidence, this paper explores some of the issues posed by this dual financing challenge. We discuss the ""fiscal self-reliance"" of the energy sector, finding that carbon pricing would generate sufficient fiscal revenues within each region to finance total investment in energy supply. Even when allowing for trade in emission permits, regional carbon fiscal revenues should still suffice to cover both their own investment in energy supply and permit purchases from abroad. We show that incremental energy-supply investment (and saving) needs are well within the range of past variation of aggregate investment, and argue that the challenge is rather to ensure that revenues from carbon pricing and other sources are complemented by investment in the appropriate sectors. But fairness and equity are likely to warrant transfers from advanced industrial countries to developing nations.","[""abstract""]"

To our knowledge, in all instances the models ignore inequalities in economic variables beyond regional differences. Here, we introduce heterogeneous subregional populations (distributed by income) and explore how the optimal trajectories are affected by whether regional damage afflicts the poor predominantly. We find that when future damage falls especially hard on the poor, considerably greater global mitigation effort is optimal than when damage is proportional to income. Integrated assessment models of climate and the economy provide estimates of the social cost of carbon and inform climate policy. We create a variant of the Regional Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (RICE)—a regionally disaggregated version of the Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy (DICE)—in which we introduce a more fine-grained representation of economic inequalities within the model’s regions. This allows us to model the common observation that climate change impacts are not evenly distributed within regions and that poorer people are more vulnerable than the rest of the population. Our results suggest that this is important to the social cost of carbon—as significant, potentially, for the optimal carbon price as the debate between Stern and Nordhaus on discounting.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

The carbon sequestration potential of agroforestry and forestry projects was studied in Nepal, Uganda and Tanzania. Carbon sequestration in biomass was 0.43 and 2.0 Mg C ha−1 year−1 in regeneration of natural forests in Tanzania and Nepal, respectively. Carbon sequestration rates in planted forests were 4.0 Mg C ha−1 year−1 for Eucalyptus woodlots in Uganda and 5.9 Mg C ha−1 year−1 for Pinus patula plantations in Tanzania. The economic profitability of these land-use systems was calculated using the Net Present Value (NPV). Based on a carbon price of US $10 per ton (Mg) and an annual interest rate of 10%, the NPV increased by between 4.9% and 6.5% for these systems when the carbon value was added to the timber value and value of non-wood products. This increase in value is probably too small to justify the cost in relation to project development, establishment of baseline, carbon monitoring costs, assessment of leakage and documentation of the effect on sustainable development.","[""abstract""]"

While the per-hectare carbon capture potential of rangelands is less than either cropland or forests, existing research suggests modest changes in carbon storage on rangelands can potentially alter the global carbon cycle. This paper examines the potential firm-level revenues from voluntary carbon offset programs, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) Rangeland Soil Carbon Offset program. We estimate revenues for short-term voluntary offsets given historical prices and prices projected with potential cap-and-trade legislation. We also estimate revenues assuming 100-yr offsets are required to meet international sequestration standards. Simulation results indicate a relatively wide range of modest revenues from recent CCX contracts and carbon prices. The analysis suggests that recent carbon prices or low-end projected prices from cap-and-trade legislation are not likely to encourage producer participation. Medium and high carbon price projections for cap-and-trade legislation may make carbon sequestration a more attractive option for rangeland managers, but given potential requirements for projects to meet international guidelines for greenhouse gas offset projects, many issues remain before range managers may be interested in carbon sequestration as an enterprise. Resumen La preocupación sobre el cambio climático ha aumentado el interés en el secuestro de carbono en tierras de uso agropecuario. Mientras que el potencial de captura de carbono en pastizales es menor que en tierras agrícolas y bosques, investigaciones sugieren que cambios modestos en el almacén de carbono en pastizales potencialmente alteran el ciclo global del carbono. Este artículo examina el ingreso potencial a nivel de empresa en programas voluntarios para la compensación de carbono tales como el programa de Compensación de Carbono en Pastizales del Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX). Estimamos ingresos en el corto plazo por compensaciones voluntarias dado precios históricos y precios proyectados con potencial con legislación de tope y compra-venta. También estimamos ingresos asumiendo 100 años de compensación tal como es requerido para cumplir los estándares internacionales de captura. Resultados de simulaciones indican relativamente amplio margen de modestos ingresos de contratos recientes del CCX y precios del carbono. El análisis sugiere que los precios recientes del carbono o proyectos de menor importancia de la legislación tipo tope y compra-venta no tienen posibilidad de encontrar la participación de los productores. La proyección de precios medianos y altos del carbono de la legislación tope y compra-venta podría hacer más atractiva la opción de captura de carbono para los manejadores de pastizales pero, dado los requerimientos potenciales para proyectos que cumplan con los lineamientos internacionales para la compensación de proyectos de gases de efecto invernadero, muchos aspectos están presentes antes de que los manejadores de pastizales pudieran estar interesados en el secuestro de carbono a nivel empresarial.","[""abstract""]"

By using a simple model, we show some possible cases where carbon emission reduction progresses in a self-fulfilling prophecy by firms expecting others' future actions. In such circumstances, the carbon pricing system does not have much influence on determining the final outcome of economy-wide emission reduction.

However, not all governments are willing to commit to targets of equal stringency, and individual countries may put different emphases on carbon pricing in their policy mix. Carbon prices may thus continue to differ over longer time horizons. Therefore, measures to protect production of carbon-intensive materials from carbon leakage might be required not only as short-term transition instruments, but also for longer periods. Leakage protection measures therefore need to preserve carbon price incentives for emission mitigation across the value chain. If ex-ante or dynamic free allocation of emission allowances is used as a leakage protection measure, only the primary producers face the full carbon price signal for efficiency improvements. Accordingly, shifts to lower-carbon fuels and the carbon price signal for intermediate and final consumers are muted. Thus a large share of mitigation opportunities cannot be realized. Combining dynamic allocation of allowances with a consumption charge (Inclusion of Consumption into the The European Union Emissions Trading System, EU ETS) or combining full auctioning with Border Carbon Adjustment could reinstate the carbon price signal along the value chain and create incentives for breakthrough technologies, the use of higher-value products with lower weight and carbon intensity, alternative lower-carbon materials and more tailored use of materials. Border Carbon Adjustment is, however, politically contentious as it has often been discussed as an instrument to discriminate against foreign producers. Hence it is important to further explore design details to implement the combination of dynamic allocation with Inclusion of Consumption in the EU ETS.","[""abstract""]"

However, little is known about the economic potential of fire management projects or the locations where projects might be economically viable for providing GHG offsets. A benefit–cost analysis of fire management for GHG offsets is presented here, which includes spatially explicit estimates for GHG abatement under three assumptions of management efficacy (conservative, empirically based, upper potential). The total supply of GHG abatement is estimated under different prices and management efficacy assumptions, and areas that pass the benefit–cost analysis are identified. At the Australian Government's carbon price of A$23 per metric tonne of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e), fire management would be economically viable across 51 million hectares, all within the higher monsoonal rainfall regions of northern Australia, abating 1.6 million tonnes of CO2-e per year. These estimates suggest that fire management projects can contribute to GHG abatement targets and be financially viable across large areas of northern Australia. Additional benefits are anticipated from these projects for biodiversity conservation, livelihoods for indigenous Australians and economic development in remote regions.","[""abstract""]"

This paper assesses it's different possible uses, the competition between these uses, and the implications for long‐term global energy demand and energy system emissions. A scenario analysis is performed using the TIMER energy system model. Under baseline conditions, 170 EJ yr−1 of secondary bioenergy is consumed in 2100 (approximately 18% of total secondary energy demand), used primarily in the transport, buildings and nonenergy (chemical production) sectors. This leads to a reduction of 9% of CO2 emissions compared to a counterfactual scenario where no bioenergy is used. Bioenergy can contribute up to 40% reduction in emissions at carbon taxes greater than 500/tC. As higher CO2 taxes are applied, bioenergy is increasingly diverted towards electricity generation. Results are more sensitive to assumptions about resource availability than technological parameters. To estimate the effectiveness of bioenergy in specific sectors, experiments are performed in which bioenergy is only allowed in one sector at a time. The results show that cross‐sectoral leakage and emissions from biomass conversion limit the total emission reduction possible in each sector. In terms of reducing emissions per unit of bioenergy use, we show that the use of bioelectricity is the most effective, especially when used with carbon capture and storage. However, this technology only penetrates at a high carbon price (>100/tC) and competition with transport fuels may limit its adoption.","[""abstract""]"

Various mitigation options have since been explored for their potential to reduce on-farm greenhouse gas emissions. Among these is the use of alternative pastures that lower methane (CH4) production of grazing animals such as Lotus corniculatus, a legume that contains condensed tannins that inhibit the formation of CH4 in the rumen. Lotus has other benefits for sheep production such as increased wool growth, liveweight gain and fecundity. This study modelled the potential emission, production and economic outcomes for wool and lamb enterprises that incorporate lotus in their pastures, evaluating the impact of existing farm productivity, lotus intake and carbon price. Depending on the amount of lotus consumed and the CH4 reduction rate, CH4 emissions fell by 0.02–0.38 t carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e)/ha and 0.05–0.48 t CO2e/ha on wool and prime lamb enterprises, respectively. At a price of $6/t CO2e potential offset income attributable to use of lotus across all enterprises was $0.12–2.91/ha. Increases in income from increased productivity were 15–30 times greater than from potential carbon offset income. Income was driven by the amount of lotus dry matter intake and the subsequent production benefits. Over a 10-year period prime lamb enterprises generated up to $50/ha in profit by using lotus, due to increased liveweight gain and fecundity. In most modelled scenarios wool enterprises would not cover the cost of lotus pasture establishment. This research demonstrated that 18–23% and 37–46% of lotus intake within the diet was required to generate production enough to cover pasture establishment costs on prime lamb and wool enterprises, respectively. Potential carbon offset income would not be sufficient for farmers to establish lotus without the productivity benefits. While extra profit may be gained on prime lamb enterprises through the use of lotus, problems with persistence must first be overcome for lotus to be adopted on farms.","[""abstract""]"

Missing from much of the debate on trade-related measures is a broader understanding of how climate policies implemented unilaterally (or subglobally) affect all countries in the global trading system. Arguably, the largest impacts are from the targeted carbon pricing itself, which generates macroeconomic effects, terms-of-trade changes, and shifts in global energy demand and prices; it also changes the relative prices of certain energy-intensive goods. This paper studies how climate policies implemented in certain major economies (the European Union and the United States) affect the global distribution of economic and environmental outcomes and how these outcomes may be altered by complementary policies aimed at addressing carbon leakage.","[""abstract""]"

A range of economic values (EVs) were assumed for CH4 production calculated from possible carbon prices (£/t CO2 equivalent (CO2-e)). The implicit price of carbon required for maintenance of CH4 levels or to reduce CH4 production by 0·1 kg/head/yr in a hill flock was calculated. The predicted genetic changes in CH4 production from current selection programmes that have an implicit methane EV of zero were calculated. Correlations between production traits and CH4 production were sampled from assumed normal distributions, as these correlations are currently unknown. Methane emissions are likely to increase at a rate of c. 3 kg CO2-e/ewe/yr as a result of using current industry selection indices in hill sheep farming systems in the UK. Breeding objectives for more productive hill sheep include reducing lamb losses and rearing more, heavier lambs. By placing a cost on carbon emissions to halt the genetic increase in methane, heavy penalties will be incurred by farmers in terms of reduced productivity. This amounts to £6/ewe/yr or a 5% discounted loss of £2851 per 100 ewe flock over a 10-year selection horizon. If the correlations between production traits and CH4 are positive (as expected) then an implicit carbon price of c. £272/t CO2-e is required for no genetic increase in CH4 production if methane is not measured and c. £50/t CO2-e if methane could be measured. Achievement of government targets for the whole economy of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) over a 30-year period would require carbon prices (/t CO2-e) of £1396 (indirect selection) or £296 (direct selection) for the sheep industry to achieve a 20% reduction entirely via a genetic change of c. –0·1 kg methane/head/yr. These carbon prices are placed in the context of possible government policies. A combination of genetic and non-genetic measures will probably be required for cost-effective reduction in methane production to meet government targets.","[""abstract""]"

The present follow-up study revealed an even higher nutrient bioextraction capacity in the cold-water species Saccharina latissima at 3 sites—the mouth of the Bronx River Estuary (Bronx, NY; BRE), western Long Island Sound (Fairfield, CT; WLIS) and central Long Island Sound (Branford, CT; CLIS), during winter and spring of the 2012−2013 growing season. These sites differ in temperature (BRE > CLIS > WIS), salinity (BRE < WLIS = CLIS) and nutrients (BRE >> WLIS = CLIS). We estimated that S. latissima could remove up to 180, 67 and 38 kg N ha−1 at BRE, WLIS and CLIS respectively, in a hypothetical kelp farm system with 1.5 m spacing between longlines. In the same hypothetical kelp farm system, the estimated carbon sequestration values are 1350 (BRE), 1800 (WLIS) and 1100 (CLIS) kg C ha−1. The potential monetary values of N sequestration by the sugar kelp are up to $1600 (BRE), $760 (WLIS) and $430 (CLIS) ha−1, if incorporated in the State of Connecticut Nitrogen Credit Trading Program and a carbon-pricing scheme. The potential economic values of C sequestration are $30−300 (BRE), $40−400 WLIS), and $24−240 (CLIS) ha−1. These results suggest that seaweed aquaculture is a useful technique for nutrient bioextraction in urbanized coastal waters, such as LIS and BRE. Alternation of the warmand cold-water species would maximize nutrient bioextraction and augment other ecosystem services, producing economic benefits for the region while helping to manage non-source eutrophication.","[""abstract""]"

The main findings are that (i) a simple AR(4) process best describes the 2008 convenience yield, and (ii) there exists a non linear relation between spot and futures prices. The approach developed in this article captures 74% of the explanatory power for the 2008 convenience yield variable in an autoregressive framework, with carbon spot price levels, moving averages and carbon futures realized volatility measures as exogenous regressors.

In the extensive grazing land of Australia, landholders may participate in the Australian Government’s Emissions Reduction Fund and create offsets by reducing woody vegetation clearing and allowing native woody plant regrowth to grow. This study used bioeconomic modelling to evaluate the trade-offs between an existing central Queensland grazing operation, which has been using repeated tree clearing to maintain pasture growth, and an alternative carbon and grazing enterprise in which tree clearing is reduced and the additional carbon sequestered in trees is sold. The results showed that ceasing clearing in favour of producing offsets produces a higher net present value over 20 years than the existing cattle enterprise at carbon prices, which are close to current (2015) market levels (~$13 t–1 CO2-e). However, by modifying key variables, relative profitability did change. Sensitivity analysis evaluated key variables, which determine the relative profitability of carbon and cattle. In order of importance these were: the carbon price, the gross margin of cattle production, the severity of the tree–grass relationship, the area of regrowth retained, the age of regrowth at the start of the project, and to a lesser extent the cost of carbon project administration, compliance and monitoring. Based on the analysis, retaining regrowth to generate carbon income may be worthwhile for cattle producers in Australia, but careful consideration needs to be given to the opportunity cost of reduced cattle income.","[""abstract""]"

We develop a multi-objective optimization model that minimizes the total cost and CO2 emissions of a regional timber logistics network and seeks for the simultaneous optimization of logistics network design and operation. The generic model is applied to a case study in Jiangle County in China. The Pareto solution set, derived by applying the normalized normal constraint method, shows the relationship between carbon emissions and total cost. Our results reveal that both network structure and the allocations of timber flows have effects on the Pareto solutions, suggesting the importance of considering network design and management together in logistics network analysis. The model results also indicate that though the current carbon price is hard to trigger the change of the timber logistics network structure in Jiangle County, it can still be a driving force to push the decision-makers to implement lower carbon logistics plans. Additionally, sensitivity analysis shows that improving road conditions can remarkably reduce CO2 emissions in the logistics network and that maintaining an appropriate ratio of timber supply to demand can lead to some compromise between carbon emissions and total cost. These findings offer new insights into the trade-offs between the carbon emissions and total cost of the regional timber logistics network, which are of value to logistics network designers and managers as well as policy-makers in the study region and beyond.","[""abstract""]"

This is particularly the case in fast developing ASEAN countries. However, there is still considerable uncertainty about the prospects of nuclear power in terms of its economic viability and associated risks given a highly uncertain future energy industry context. This paper employs a stochastic tool based on the Monte Carlo simulation technique to assess the expected generation costs and risk profiles of different electricity generation portfolios of coal, Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT), and nuclear plants. The tool explicitly incorporates uncertain future fuel and carbon price, and plant capital costs into the analysis. Results from the model enable tradeoffs between expected system generation cost, associated risks and CO2 emissions among generation portfolios to be identified. In this paper the economics of nuclear power in relation to coal and CCGT are evaluated for different portfolio mixes under a number of scenarios of future fuel and carbon prices in the context of the ASEAN region. Results highlight the important role that a carbon price is likely to play in making nuclear power an economic option.","[""abstract""]"

The motivation for this research is to endogenize electricity consumption with economic activity by introducing electricity demand, and the interactions between electricity use and economic activity, into macroeconomic demand equations. In this paper, I create an energy and macroeconomic model that examines the dynamics of the US electricity markets at the sectoral level on a monthly basis. I use nearly a quarter century of monthly data to model the dynamics of several macroeconomic and electricity series, then combine these equations into a single large model. By incorporating multiple sectors of demand at once and using high-frequency data, the model provides robust feedbacks between electricity markets as well as the larger macroeconomy. The short-run is modeled simultaneously with the long-run and seasonal properties of the data using a equilibrium-disturbance technique. The equilibrium relationships are specified first at the individual equation level; these equations are then linked together to create a single large, cross-sector model. This approach allows for proper identification and specification of feedback between the electricity sectors and the economy. Using this model, I conduct several forecasting exercises to examine the impact of the 2007-2008 recession. I also conduct two sets of simulations: one scenario examines the effects of instituting a carbon price and the second examines several weather-based scenarios.","[""abstract""]"

The paper develops a framework to analyze firmlevel and climate effects of carbon pricing, focusing particularly on imports of intermediate inputs. This is achieved through setting up two policy experiments: carbon pricing in one of the firm’s sourcing markets, and retroactive carbon pricing in the export market. This extension of Bernard et al’s framework gives chance to think about emissions regulations along multiple margins of international trade. Additionally, an outline of several interesting scenarios for future policy simulations is provided, connecting the research to questions of policy coordination across countries.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Increasing demand response has also been discussed as a way to reduce carbon emissions in the U.S. electricity industry. We examine the short-run effectiveness of a policy combining demand response with a carbon tax. Using plant-level operational data, we construct short-run cost curves for three U.S. regional electric systems, and examine the impacts on prices and carbon emissions. In the short run, a carbon tax in the range of $30 - $40 and a price elasticity of demand in the range of -0.1 to -0.2 could reduce carbon emissions in coal-intensive regions by 10% to 25%. With this same set of carbon prices, achieving a 50% reduction in emissions would require a price elasticity of demand in the range of -0.25 to -0.4. Percentage reductions of this magnitude in less carbon-intensive systems are unlikely, even with highly elastic demand and high carbon prices.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

Carbon taxation currently plays no role. The Commission has recently proposed to revise the energy tax system in the EU to include a carbon tax component. This paper evaluates the Commission proposal and considers the possible expansion of the EU carbon pricing base either by expanding emissions trading to cover more sectors or by enacting a carbon tax. It concludes that there are strong arguments for expanding the carbon pricing base, as suggested by the Commission. Nevertheless, expanding the base should done through a unified system, such as expanding the coverage of the emissions trading system or enacting an economy-wide carbon tax rather than through having side-by-side taxes and trading, as in the Commission proposal.","[""abstract"",""title""]"

This study explores the evolution of the carbon price in the carbon market from a dynamic system perspective. A three-dimensional carbon price dynamic system is established to quantify the interactions among the carbon price, energy price, and economic growth. The system built in this study presents various dynamic characteristics including chaotic attractors and stable equilibria. Specifically, the existence of chaos in the system is verified by Lyapunov exponents spectrum and bifurcation diagram. In contrast, the system tends to be stable in the case of China after identifying the system parameters through the genetic algorithm. Furthermore, evolutionary trends of the carbon price are analyzed when the system parameters are perturbed. The results show that the carbon price is positively correlated with energy price as well as energy price policy. Besides, the level of the carbon price is negatively correlated with government control in the short term and positively correlated in the long term. This study can help analyze trends in the carbon price in the mid-term to long-term.","[""abstract"",""title""]"
