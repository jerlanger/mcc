The implementation of CCS requires the resolution of a number of difficult policy, engineering and economic issues. Here we address the efficacy of CCS from the perspective of climate science. Implementation of CCS makes power stations less efficient, in the sense that they produce more CO2 for a given output of electricity, a feature which is characterised by the so-called energy penalty. The captured CO2 is then stored in, for example, geological storage reservoirs, from which some small fraction is expected to leak back into the atmosphere each year. \n We use a set of relatively simple models of carbon capture, the atmospheric carbon cycle and climate, to quantify, for a range of CCS engineering and implementation parameters, the amount of leakage from these reservoirs that can be tolerated to ensure that CCS leads to less, rather than more, climate change. We demonstrate that up to the year 2100, for almost all the parameters that we consider, application of CCS is beneficial. However, in some cases the benefit might be small. We also consider a much longer time horizon (out to the year 2500). We find that while many parameter combinations still lead to a benefit, there are some cases for which application of CCS leads to greater warming than had it not been applied at all. The largest single controlling factor is seen to be the storage reservoir retention time. Many previous studies focused on the use of those storage reservoirs with very long retention times, but we demonstrate that the use of less resilient reservoirs might also provide a climate benefit during the 100 to 500 year time horizon. The largest absolute benefits of CCS to global temperature are found for high future emission scenarios. These absolute benefits also increase as the climate sensitivity of the model is increased.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "e88a7e6a175b0c1b281a90307cadf1b5e30ecafe", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2490147159", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-11943-4", "CorpusId": 129997084}, "title": "Carbon Capture, Storage and Use: Technical, Economic, Environmental and Societal Perspectives", "abstract": "Fossil-based energy conversion and energy-intensive industries are sources of a large part of global CO2 emissions.

A critical element for the commercialisation of CCS is the construction and operation of up to 12 coal-fired CCS demonstration plants. The cost of this demonstration programme has been estimated to be between 8.5 and 13 billion Euros. This cost has been estimated assuming the size and composition of the fleet of the CCS demonstration plants and by calculating, based on a cash flow analysis, their additional discounted lifetime costs. The calculations presented in this report show that the additional costs for a 400 MW plant range between 680 million Euros for coal-plants and 550 Euros for gas plants. Assuming a CO2 price as in the scenarios developed for the second European Strategic Energy Review, the additional revenue required for making these demonstration plants competitive in the electricity market are 46 Euros for coal plants and 77 Euros for gas plants per tonne of CO2 avoided. These calculations are very sensitive to the assumptions made with regards to the capital costs, the costs of CO2 transport and storage, fuel and CO2 prices and the discount rate. These additional costs have been estimated using reference values for the cost of the CO2 capture technologies (preand post-combustion and oxyfuel), which have stemmed from an extensive assessment of literature sources using a transparent methodology, which alleviates to a significant extent the confusion about the economics of CCS technologies.

Most of these CO2 emissions originate from the burning of fossil fuels (e.g. power plants). Governments and industry worldwide are now proposing to capture CO2 from their power plants and either store it in depleted reservoirs or saline aquifers (\u2018Carbon Capture and Storage\u2019, CCS), or use it for \u2018Enhanced Oil Recovery\u2019 (EOR) in depleting oil and gas fields. The capture of this anthropogenic (man made sources of CO2 ) CO2 will mitigate global warming, and possibly reduce the impact of climate change. The United States has over 30 years experience with the transportation of carbon dioxide by pipeline, mainly from naturally occurring, relatively pure CO2 sources for onshore EOR. CCS projects differ significantly from this past experience as they will be focusing on anthropogenic sources from major polluters such as fossil fuel power plants, and the necessary CO2 transport infrastructure will involve both long distance onshore and offshore pipelines. Also, the fossil fuel power plants will produce CO2 with varying combinations of impurities depending on the capture technology used. CO2 pipelines have never been designed for these differing conditions; therefore, CCS will introduce a new generation of CO2 for transport. Application of current design procedures to the new generation pipelines is likely to yield an over-designed pipeline facility, with excessive investment and operating cost. In particular, the presence of impurities has a significant impact on the physical properties of the transported CO2 which affects: pipeline design; compressor/pump power; repressurisation distance; pipeline capacity. These impurities could also have implications in the fracture control of the pipeline. All these effects have direct implications for both the technical and economic feasibility of developing a carbon dioxide transport infrastructure onshore and offshore. This paper compares and contrasts the current experience of transporting CO2 onshore with the proposed transport onshore and offshore for CCS. It covers studies on the effect of physical and transport properties (hydraulics) on key technical aspects of pipeline transportation, and the implications for designing and operating a pipeline for CO2 containing impurities. The studies reported in the paper have significant implications for future CO2 transportation, and highlight a number of knowledge gaps that will have to be filled to allow for the efficient and economic design of pipelines for this \u2018next\u2019 generation of anthropogenic CO2 .Copyright \u00a9 2008 by ASME", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "990eec25676061f8900ceaeb935d1ec79cbaed6c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2902408157", "CorpusId": 134731097}, "title": "Potential for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the Nordic region", "abstract": "The objective of this study is to give an overview of the potential for applying CCS in the Nordic countries (Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Norway and Iceland).

The role of energy technologies is considered crucial in climate change mitigation. In particular, carbon capture and storage (CCS) promises to allow for low-emissions fossil-fuel based power generation. The technology is under development; a number of technological, economic, environmental and safety issues remain to be solved. With regard to its sustainability impact, CCS raises a number of questions: On the one hand, CCS may prolong the prevailing coal-to-electricity regime and countervail efforts in other mitigation categories. On the other hand, given the indisputable need to continue using fossil fuels for some time, it may serve as a bridging technology towards a sustainable energy future. In this paper, we discuss the relevant issues for the case of Germany. We provide a survey of the current state of the art of CCS and activities, and perform an energy-environment-economic analysis using a general equilibrium model for Germany. The model analyzes the impact of introducing carbon constraints with respect to the deployment of CCS, to the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, to the energy and technology mix and with respect to interaction of different mitigation efforts. The results show the relative importance of the components in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. For example, under the assumption of a CO2 policy, both energy efficiency and CCS will contribute to climate gas mitigation. A given climate target can be achieved at lower marginal costs when the option of CCS is included.

A September 2008 McKinsey report estimated that the first commercial scale CCS projects, potentially to be built soon after 2020, would cost \u20ac35-50 per metric ton of CO2 abated. They assume that if 500+ projects were built by 2030, the cost might fall to \u20ac25-40 per ton. About two-thirds of that cost is for CO2 capture. It is interesting to consider those costs on a global scale. A study by Pacala and Socolow implies that we need to cut a cumulative 25 Gton of CO2 over the next 50 years just to cap the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere at a modest 500 ppm (we are now at 390 ppm). If all of our solutions cost \u20ac25 per ton, the economic impact would be \u20ac625 billion ($833 billion) over the next 50 years. Reducing CO2 is a global issue, but the US creates 20% of the problem. It also offers an interesting case study on the difficulty of finding practical solutions in a challenging political and economic environment. Hopefully along the way the reader will discover opportunities as well as pitfalls to avoid. According to the US Department of Energy\u2019s Energy Information Administration (DOE-EIA), 98% of America\u2019s human-generated CO2 comes from energy use, with 40% of that from electricity (coal and natural gas) and 33% from transportation (mostly petroleum). Coal produces 45% of America\u2019s electricity and natural gas produces 23% (see Figure 1). McKinsey\u2019s study notes that \u2018Retrofitting of existing power plants is likely to be more expensive than new installations, and economically feasible only for relatively new plants (with high efficiencies).\u2019 But according to the DOE-EIA, over the past 20 years coal contributed only 3.7% of total added US capacity while natural gas accounted for 88%. Few modern, efficient US coal plants have been added in the past 20 years. \u2018Efficiency\u2019 is a term used to define the conversion of the theoretical energy content of a fuel into electricity. The McKinsey report notes that the energy required for the CCS CO2 capture process increases the amount of coal that must be burned per MW-hour delivered, and estimates a CCS \u2018efficiency penalty\u2019 of 10%. This means that if a future coal plant could be built to achieve a 50% thermal efficiency, CCS would decrease that efficiency to 40%. Such a plant would be burning 50/40=1.25 times as much coal per MW-hour. And burning 25% more coal would also increase harmful emissions since CCS captures only about 90% of CO2 and none of the other pollutants. CCS also faces storage challenges, such as site selection, CO2 transportation costs, pipeline and CCS site permits, and uncertainties in monitoring CO2 sequestration. Leakage of just 0.5% per year would result in a loss of 64% of CO2 to the atmosphere over 200 years. What company wants to expose itself to superfund-type legal and financial exposure with a time horizon that extends out a century or more? But the biggest challenge in the US may be the low efficiency levels of the installed base of coal-fired plants. While the World Coal Association argues that new technology coal plants can achieve 45% efficiency, DOE/ EIA data show that existing US coal plants only operate at an average efficiency of 33.5%. A 10% efficiency penalty would lower that efficiency to 23.5% and decrease the electricity output by almost 30%.

The CCS process can be costly, however, and large-scale implementation by industry will require government regulations and economic incentives. The incentives can price CO2 emissions through a tax or a cap-and-trade system. This paper extends the earlier mixed-integer linear programming model to endogenously determine the optimal quantity of CO2 to capture and optimize the various components of a CCS infrastructure network, given the price per tonne to emit CO2 into the atmosphere. The spatial decision support system first generates a candidate pipeline network and then minimizes the total cost of capturing, transporting, storing, or emitting CO2.

These point sources and storage reservoirs are heterogeneous in the amount of CO2 that they produce or store and in the costs of capturing or storing CO2, and the associated cost structures interact to determine the returns to scale for the entire coupled system. The SimCCS cost-minimizing geospatial deployment model is used to deploy CCS for a variety of combinations of CO2 sources and injection reservoirs and determine the returns to scale for CCS deployment and unravel the determinants thereof. SimCCS minimizes the total costs of the entire capture, transport, and storage system by simultaneously determining how much CO2 is captured from each source, how much CO2 is stored in each storage reservoir, and assigning CO2 flows through pipeline networks that include trunk distribution lines that are routed to minimize the influence of the social and physical topography.

The United States oil and gas industry has a long experience in transporting, injecting, and effectively storing CO2 in tertiary oil recovery operations usually known as Enhanced Oil Recovery. As a result, there already exists a legal and regulatory framework that addresses many - but not all - of the issues that will need to be addressed if carbon capture and storage is to be adopted by policymakers as part of a carbon regulation regime. A review of that existing framework allows identification of those aspects that appear adequate to govern the sale, transport, and injection of CO2 for carbon capture and storage purposes as well as those that do not. Building on this analysis, the authors conclude that the current legal framework will be largely adequate from a transactional and interim standpoint to allow parties to structure a relatively seamless transition from CO2 storage that is an incidental result of oil production operations to those incremental injections of CO2 intended solely for permanent underground storage. The authors also suggest some possible approaches for crafting new rules to fill potentially remaining legal or regulatory gaps. I. INTRODUCTION In recent years, an increasing number of governments around the world have begun to regulate atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) in one fashion or another. Others, including the United States, are actively debating whether to implement carbon regulation,1 and if so, under what terms and conditions. One potentially important tool for reducing CO2 emissions is the separation and \"capture\" of the CO2 produced in the generation of electricity from coal; piping it to storage sites where it would be injected for permanent storage in underground geological formations. This process is known as carbon capture and storage or \"CCS\" (sometimes also referred to as \"carbon capture and sequestration\" or \"carbon capture and disposal\"). While interest in CCS is relatively new, the underground injection and effective storage of large quantities of CO2 is not. As explained below, the United States' oil and gas industry has been transporting CO2 by pipeline for injection as a tertiary, or enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique, for nearly forty years.2 In addition, significant quantities of CO2 have been piped to industrial facilities for use in various processes as well as for distribution by rail or truck to large numbers of CO2 end users nationwide. As a result, there is already in place a CO2 industry infrastructure comprising over approximately 13,000 permitted CO2 injections wells (over 6,000 of which are active) and thousands of miles of CO2 pipeline with associated CO2 handling facilities, all of which represents a major investment of private financial and intellectual capital. Estimates of the amount of CO2 injected each year in American EOR activities are in excess of fifty million metric tonnes,3 with cumulative injections since 1972 estimated at over 600 million metric tonnes.4 The current annual injection quantity is thus roughly equivalent to the amount of CO2 that might be captured from the first twenty newly constructed 500 MW coal-fired power plants that capture eighty percent of their CO2 output.5 This CO2 is currently being injected through over 6,100 active injection wells6 and makes possible daily oil production of about 245,000 barrels.7 While the majority of current CO2 supply comes from naturally-occurring geologic formations that have been developed much like an oil or gas field, the C02-based EOR business originated in the 1970s with anthropogenic sources of CO2 and even today some CO2 supply remains anthropogenic in origin, captured by separation from natural gas production or from certain industrial facilities. Moreover, while EOR operations strive to recycle and reuse the maximum amount possible of the initially-injected CO2, a large percentage of the injected CO2 - on the order of fifty percent or more8 - cannot be recovered for reuse under current technology and remains stored in the underground formation as an incident of the oil production operation. \u2026", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "5f97a0974cefea3c11c1b478d28cad6745759550", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1520963047", "CorpusId": 55690870}, "title": "The Legal Implications of Carbon Capture and Storage Under the Sea", "abstract": "This Article is brought to you for free and open access by the Washington College of Law Journals & Law Reviews at Digital Commons @ AmericanUniversity Washington College of Law.

Near-term prospects favor CCS for certain industrial sources and electric power plants, with storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Deep aquifers may provide an attractive longer-term storage option, whereas ocean storage poses greater technical and environmental uncertainty.

While it is well established that species-rich natural forests offer superior C sequestering benefits relative to short-rotation commercial monoculture plantations, differences in rates of C capture and storage between longer-lived plantations (commercial or non-commercial) and natural forests remain unclear. Using a natural experiment in the Western Ghats of India, where late-20th century conservation laws prohibited timber extraction from monodominant plantations and natural forests within nature reserves, we assessed forests and plantations for aboveground C storage and the magnitude and temporal stability of rates of photosynthetic C capture (gross primary production). Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that species-rich forests show greater temporal stability of C capture, and are more resistant to drought, than monodominant plantations. Carbon stocks in monodominant teak (Tectona grandis) and Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus spp.) plantations were 30-50% lower than in natural evergreen forests, but differed little from moist-deciduous forests. Plantations had 4-9% higher average C capture rates (estimated using the Enhanced Vegetation Index \u2013 EVI) than natural forests during wet seasons, but up to 29% lower C capture during dry seasons across the 2000-18 period. In both seasons, the rate of C capture by plantations was less stable across years, and decreased more during drought years (i.e., lower resistance to drought), compared to forests. Thus, even as certain monodominant plantations could match natural forests for C capture and storage potential, plantations are unlikely to match the stability \u2013 and hence reliability \u2013 of C capture exhibited by forests, particularly in the face of increasing droughts and other climatic perturbations. Promoting natural forest regeneration and/or multi-species native tree plantations instead of plantation monocultures could therefore benefit climate change mitigation efforts, while offering valuable co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and other ecosystem services.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "477706fc4a7f3609131aba02b39b6e24098456bc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2131982190", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2009.01.020", "CorpusId": 154779076}, "title": "Global learning on carbon capture and storage: A call for strong international cooperation on CCS demonstration", "abstract": null, "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "8cc5ff795467b8e9c0d4d6ac887dc71acdd7cf05", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1592955153", "CorpusId": 154270651}, "title": "Public awareness of carbon capture and storage : a survey of attitudes toward climate change mitigation", "abstract": "The Carbon Capture and Sequestration Technologies Program in the Laboratory for Energy and the Environment at MIT conducted a survey of public attitudes on energy use and environmental concerns.

The analysis in this thesis uses the survey responses to draw conclusions about the level of public understanding and awareness of global climate change and carbon dioxide capture and storage and to suggest implications for public outreach. The survey results show that carbon dioxide capture and storage and carbon sequestration are largely unknown to the general public, and there is significant confusion over which environmental issue the technology is intended to address.

It involves capturing carbon dioxide from power plants, transporting it and storing it in secure places including former oil and gas fields and marine aquifers. However, the use of coal does not only contribute to the global climate change, it also has other important environmental impacts, for example: acidification, eutrophication and depletion of non-renewable resources. In order to assess whether or to what extent the introduction of CCS to coal-fired power plants will contribute to reducing these and other environmental impacts, life cycle assessment (LCA) which considers a full supply chain from resource extraction to ultimate waste management should be conducted. This paper is part of the background research for the development of a full LCA study of coal-fired power plants with carbon capture and storage. Through a literature review of a wide range of international studies, particular attention is given to understanding the scopes of former LCA studies and their environmental assessments. The results of the review show that, although previous LCA studies have been informative to some extent, no complete LCA has been performed yet on coal combustion power plants with CCS, with important gaps identified in terms of the consideration of parts of the supply chain, alternative technologies and potentially important impact categories.

With the growth of cement production, CO2 emissions are increasing rapidly too. Carbon capture and storage is the most feasible new technology option to reduce CO2 emissions in the cement industry. More research on environmental impacts is required to provide the theoretical basis for the implementation of carbon capture and storage in cement production. In this paper, GaBi software and scenario analysis were employed to quantitatively analyze and compare the environmental impacts of cement production with and without carbon capture and storage technology, from the perspective of a life-cycle assessment; aiming to promote sustainable development of the cement industry. Results of two carbon capture and storage scenarios show decreases in the impacts of global warming potential and some environmental impacts. However, other scenarios show a significant increase in other environmental impacts. In particular, post-combustion carbon capture technology can bring a more pronounced increase in toxicity potential. Therefore, effective measures must be taken into account to reduce the impact of toxicity when carbon capture and storage is employed in cement production. CO2 transport and storage account for only a small proportion of environmental impacts. For post-combustion carbon capture, most of the environmental impacts come from the unit of combined heat and power and carbon capture, with the background production of MonoEthanolAmine contributing significantly. In combined heat and power plants, natural gas is more advantageous than a 10% coal-saving, and thermal efficiency is a key parameter affecting the environmental impacts. Future research should focus on exploring cleaner and effective absorbents or seeking the alternative fuel in combined heat and power plants for post-combustion carbon capture. If the power industry is the first to deploy carbon capture and storage, oxy-combustion carbon capture is an excellent choice for the cement industry.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "2f4f9d912beb24bf7e5ad1d6b9e96673c5ad3b54", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2942204118", "DOI": "10.1002/adma.201803444", "CorpusId": 128362993, "PubMed": "31012183"}, "title": "Rational Design of Carbon Nanomaterials for Electrochemical Sodium Storage and Capture", "abstract": "Electrochemical sodium storage and capture are considered an attractive technology owing to the natural abundance, low cost, safety, and cleanness of sodium, and the higher efficiency of the electrochemical system compared to fossil\u2010fuel\u2010based counterparts.

The world's forests take up about 2 or 3 billion tons of that output annually, and the ocean absorbs 7 billion tons. Experts estimate that another 5 to 10 billion tons of this greenhouse gas - as much as 40% of human-made CO2 - could be removed from the atmosphere and tucked safely away. Advancing the technologies needed to capture and store CO2 is a sensible strategy. In addition to increasing renewable energy and promoting energy efficiency and conservation, the strategy of advancing CO2 capture and storage (CCS) can be easily understood by all Americans who acknowledge that even though fossil fuels will be needed for a long time to come, the U.S. government at some point must confront the climate change problem by setting limits on CO2 emissions. Capturing and storing CO2 is a cost-competitive and safe way to achieve large-scale reductions in emissions. CCS technology offers a unique opportunity to reconcile limits on CO2 emissions with society's fossil fuel-dominated energy infrastructure. In ordermore\u00a0\u00bb to continue using the United States' vast domestic coal resources in a world where CO2 must be constrained, the country will need to rely on technology that can seize CO2 generated from coal-fired power plants and store it in geologic formations underground. However, the integration and scaling up of existing technologies to capture, transport, and store CO2 emitted from a full-scale power plant have not yet been demonstrated. The technical feasibility of integrating a complete CCS system with a commercial-scale power plant is not in doubt, but it is necessary to build up experience by advancing early deployment. In addition to the environmental benefits, more aggressive support of CCS technology is critical to maintaining U.S. leadership and competitiveness in both CCS and global energy-technology markets. The United States has played a leading role in nearly all R and D related to the use of fossil fuels and has always had particular expertise in coal-based power production technologies. Yet despite the great potential of CCS, the U.S. government is not investing in it aggressively. The current administration emphasizes the importance of advanced technologies, including CCS, in addressing climate change, but is not effectively promoting its demonstration and deployment. U.S. industry is already beginning to lose ground, because the handful of existing large-scale CCS projects are not in the United States. The private sector has shown substantial interest in CCS and has begun investing in development and demonstration projects. But progress will be slow without government-created incentives. The challenge for the government is to harness the private sector's interest by developing policies that reward investment in and early deployment of CCS systems.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "f9e1f4ecc12dd316821d3a038b3888c8c66403cb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "24328557", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-008044704-9/50101-4", "CorpusId": 127717930}, "title": "How aware is the public of carbon capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "8f6556c3f6d0bd8887f48fc461e56e864838b9d0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2161333170", "DOI": "10.1109/EICCCC.2006.277270", "CorpusId": 41669461}, "title": "Environmental Advocacy Groups' Perspectives on Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "As the idea of carbon capture and storage (CCS) has rapidly evolved from a relatively obscure concept to an increasingly recognized potential climate change mitigation approach that could contribute to stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations, environmental advocacy groups have been engaged in a limited, but growing, capacity in public discussions related to carbon storage.

The concentration of CO2, the most important Green House Gas (GHG), has reached to formidable levels. Although carbon capture and storage (CCS) methods have been largely worked upon, they are cumbersome in terms of economy and their long term environmental safety raises a concern. Alternatively, bio-sequestration of CO2 using microalgal cell factories has emerged as a promising way of recycling CO2 into biomass via photosynthesis which in turn could be used for the production of bioenergy and other value-added products. Despite enormous potential, the production of microalgae for low-value bulk products and bulk products such as biofuels, is heretofore, not feasible. To achieve economic viability and sustainability, major hurdles in both, the upstream and downstream processes have to be overcome. Recent technoeconomic analyses and life-cycle assessments of microalgae-based production systems have suggested that the only possible way for scaling up the production is to completely use the biomass in an integrated biorefinery set-up wherein every valuable component is extracted, processed and valorized. This article provides a brief yet comprehensive review of the present carbon sequestration and utilization technologies, focusing primarily on biological CO2 capture by microalgae in the context of bio-refinery.

In addition, they have high surface area, porosity, and selectivity towards carbon dioxide compared to other gases such as nitrogen and methane.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "b150de3a9df08e14e195c85b1a50d6be25d2ee18", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2041123590", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENECO.2006.05.016", "CorpusId": 8110310}, "title": "Incorporating carbon capture and storage technologies in integrated assessment models", "abstract": null, "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "46cf9fbd4b93080d918723440e6d63c0f5aed510", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2182520996", "CorpusId": 110083408}, "title": "Modeling Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies in Energy and Economic Models", "abstract": "There is a growing body of literature that points to the significant potential of carbon capture and storage technologies as a means for addressing concerns relating to climate change. In particular, carbon capture and storage technologies could be fundamental to controlling the costs of addressing climate change\u2014not only in sectors such as electric power production from fossil fuels, but it may also be key to facilitating the emergence of an affordable global hydrogen economy which is one potential promising pathway for decarbonizing the transportation sector. This paper examines the current state-of-the-art in modeling these carbon capture and storage technologies within \"top-down\" and \"bottom-up\" models, and explores what these types of models tell us about the potential deployment of these technologies. Generally, \"top-down\" models represent the overall energy-economic system while \"bottom-up\" models are more narrowly focused on the physical or geographical details of the entity being modeled. The paper identifies key knowledge gaps that need to be closed in order to improve the resolution and accuracy of these models\u2019 projections of the deployment of carbon capture and storage technology in the near term and over the course of this century. The paper concludes by emphasizing which features of the different types of models must be combined in order to strengthen our understanding of the global potential for carbon capture and storage as a mechanism for emissions mitigation.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "f730be14ae10faa33d78a15d2dea471db9a2bd8d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2968581565", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-816229-3.00008-9", "CorpusId": 202192391}, "title": "Carbon dioxide capture and use by microalgae in photobioreactors", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "39834289089f7317eb26213d12f50807f18c2083", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2753311920", "DOI": "10.1016/j.biortech.2017.09.050", "CorpusId": 1578799, "PubMed": "28951132"}, "title": "Carbon dioxide capture, storage and production of biofuel and biomaterials by bacteria: A review.", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "3faa79f386605e50f5a6f3e1ac819ae4ab4e66ad", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2170633168", "CorpusId": 130632848}, "title": "Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage", "abstract": "This report provides information for policy makers, scientists and engineers in the field of climate change and reduction of CO2 emissions.
