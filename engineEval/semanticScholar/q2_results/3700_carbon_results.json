Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a potentially important\ntechnology for the mitigation of industrial CO2 emissions.

Based on likely vehicle recharging profiles, GHG emissions rates from these plants are more than 40% higher than the average from all generation supplying electricity demand in California and 65% higher than the estimated marginal electricity emissions rate in California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard. Emissions from power plants supplying vehicle recharging are usually highest from 5pm-8pm, when they are 20% higher than their typical low value, from 2am-4am. Plug-in hybrid vehicles are 25-42% more efficient than conventional, gasoline hybrids, but reduce GHG emissions by less than 5%, because marginal electricity is currently much more carbon-intensive than gasoline in California (based on likely recharging profiles). Over the long term, adding vehicle recharging or renewable generation to the grid can have important impacts on how electricity is supplied. Vehicle recharging shifts capacity and generation from poorly-utilized peaking power plants to more highly-utilized baseload plants with lower operating costs. Adding renewable generation has the opposite effect, which may be partially mitigated if vehicle recharging can be made to follow renewable generation. Achieving long-term targets for deep reductions in electricity sector GHG emissions requires significantly increasing renewable or nuclear generation and reducing per-capita electricity demand or avoiding new capacity from fossil power plants without carbon capture and sequestration.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "0a7639f957a40497c522d2129ca4c6d36b9418e3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2894437242", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.201801146", "CorpusId": 187518319}, "title": "CO2 Foam Field Pilot Test for EOR and CO2 Storage in a Heterogeneous Carbonate Reservoir: Operational Design, Data Colle", "abstract": "A field demonstration test using CO2 foam for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is being implemented in a heterogeneous carbonate reservoir in the Permian Basin of Texas.

It is expected that these burners will be able to sustain stable flame in oxy-fuel conditions, but also, for start-up and emergency reasons, in conventional, air conditions. The most cost effective way of achieving dual-mode boilers is to introduce dual-mode burners. Numerical simulations allow investigation of new designs and technologies at a relatively low cost, but for the results to be trustworthy they need to be validated.

Even though coal is considered a pollutive resource, the great amounts and the increasing power demand leads to extensive use even in new developed power plants. To cover the world's future energy demand and at the same time limit our effect on global warming, coal fired power plants with CO2 capture is probably a necessity. An Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) Power Plant is a utilization of coal which gives incentives for CO2 capture. Coal is partially combusted in a reaction with steam and pure oxygen. The oxygen is produced in an air separation process and the steam is generated in the Power Island. Out of the gasifier comes a mixture of mainly H2 and CO. In a shift reactor the CO and additional steam are converted to CO2 and more H2. Carbon dioxide is separated from the hydrogen in a physical absorption process and compressed for storage. Hydrogen diluted with nitrogen from the air separation process is used as fuel in a combined cycle similar to NGCC. A complete IGCC Power Plant is described in this report. The air separation unit is modeled as a Linde two column process. Ambient air is compressed and cooled to dew point before it is separated into oxygen and nitrogen in a cryogenic distillation process. Out of the island oxygen is at a purity level of 95.6% and the nitrogen has a purity of 99.6%. The production cost of oxygen is 0.238 kWh per kilogram of oxygen delivered at 25\u00b0C and 1.4bar. The oxygen is then compressed to a gasification pressure of 42bar. In the gasification unit the oxygen together with steam is used to gasify the coal. On molar basis the coal composition is 73.5% C, 22.8% H2, 3.1% O2, 0.3% N2 and 0.3% S. The gasification temperature is at 1571\u00b0C and out of the unit comes syngas consisting of 66.9% CO, 31.1% H2, 1.4% H2O, 0.3% N2, 0.2% H2S and 0.1% CO2. The syngas is cooled and fed to a water gas shift reactor. Here the carbon monoxide is reacted with steam forming carbon dioxide and additional hydrogen. The gas composition of the gas out of the shift reactor is on dry basis 58.2% H2, 39.0% CO2, 2.4% CO, 0.2% N2 and 0.1% H2S. Both the gasification process and shift reactor is exothermal and there is no need of external heating. This leads to an exothermal heat loss, but parts of this heat is recovered. The gasifier has a Cold Gas Efficiency (CGE) of 84.0%. With a partial pressure of CO2 at 15.7 bar the carbon dioxide is easily removed by physical absorption. After separation the solvent is regenerated by expansion and CO2 is pressurized to 110bar to be stored. This process is not modeled, but for the scrubbing part an energy consumption of 0.08kWh per kilogram CO2 removed is assumed. For the compression of CO2, it is calculated with an energy consumption of 0.11kWh per kilogram CO2 removed. Removal of H2S and other pollutive unwanted substances is also removed in the CO2 scrubber. Between the CO2 removal and the combustion chamber is the H2 rich fuel gas is diluted with nitrogen from the air separation unit. This is done to increase the mass flow through the turbine. The amount of nitrogen available is decided by the amount of oxygen produced to the gasification process. Almost all the nitrogen produced may be utilized as diluter except from a few percent used in the coal feeding procedure to the gasifier. The diluted fuel gas has a composition of 50.4% H2, 46.1% N2, 2.1% CO and 1.4% CO2. In the Power Island a combined cycle with a gas turbine able to handle large H2 amounts is used. The use of steam in the gasifier and shift reactor are integrated in the heat recovery steam generator (HRSG) in the steam cycle. The heat removed from the syngas cooler is also recovered in the HRSG. The overall efficiency of the IGCC plant modeled is 36.8%.

Agroforestry plays an important role in reducing the level of GHG emissions vis-\u00e0-vis atmospheric CO2 through carbon sequestration. Carbon sequestration is the process involved in carbon capture and the long period storage of atmospheric CO2. In the present study, firstly area under agroforestry was estimated in Central Plateau and Hill region (agro-climatic zone-8) using satellite remote sensing data. Secondly, dynamic CO2FIX model v3.1 was used to assess the baseline total carbon and carbon sequestration potential (CSP) of agroforestry systems for a simulation period of 30 yr. Finally, equivalent CO2 absorption was assessed with the help of estimated agroforestry area and net CSP in the zone. Estimated area in Central Plateau and Hill region is about 1.96 million ha, which is 5.18% of total geographical area of this zone. Total carbon sequestered at zone level was estimated to be 17.81 Tg (tera gram) C and equivalent CO2 absorption is at 65.36 Tg. The CSP of agroforestry systems would be about 158.55 Tg C for a simulated period of 30 yr or CSP would be 5.28 Tg C yr\u22121 at country level. On the other hand, equivalent CO2 absorption was 586.50 Tg for a period of 30 yr or would be 19.55 Tg yr\u22121 at country level.

In this paper, we assess the potential risks related to the application of CCS technology and the acidification of aquatic ecosystems through CO2 enrichment. We use the multiple lines of evidence approach (LOEs) to characterize the effects of the acidification with contamination in aquatic sediments. We highlight and discuss the effects of acidification on the LOEs including contamination and mobility of contaminants in sediments, toxicity, macrobenthic community structure, in situ effects, and bioaccumulation\u2013biomagnification processes. We further assess the results of acidification on the toxicity of organic contaminants such as antibiotics or illicit drugs like the freebase form of cocaine (crack). The main goal of using the LOE approach is to distinguish between adverse effects that are associated with contaminants and those related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 as a result of CCS technology. Previous assessments were not designed or conducted to incorporate an integrative point of view, nor did they employ a weight of evidence approach (WOE) in risk characterization and management of CCS operations and other situations related to acidification by enrichment of CO2 in the aquatic ecosystem. Based on the findings of this review, the WOE can identify the effects of the acidification on the different LOEs used for sediment quality: contaminant mobility, the adverse effects in organism under laboratory and field conditions, and the bioaccumulation\u2013biomagnification of contaminants. The main strength in using the WOE is the ability of this method to discriminate between LOE responses associated with contamination by different organic and inorganic substances from those related to CO2 acidification itself.

One of the major challenges for the implementation of these technologies is the energy efficiency. Empirical enhancement of plasma reactors' performance has proven to be insufficient in this regard. Numerical models are therefore becoming essential to get insight into the process for optimization purposes. The chemistry in non-thermal plasmas is the most challenging and complex part of the model due to the large number of species and reactions involved. The most recent reaction kinetics model for carbon dioxide (CO2) dissociation in non-thermal microwave plasma considers more than one hundred species and thousands of reactions. To enable the implementation of this model into multidimensional simulations, a new reduction methodology to simplify the state-to-state kinetic model is presented. It is based on four key elements: 1) all the asymmetric vibrational levels are lumped within a single group or fictitious species, , 2) this group follows a non-equilibrium Treanor distribution, 3) an algebraic approximation is used to compute the vibrational temperature from the translational temperature based on the Landau\u2013Teller formula and 4) weighted algebraic expressions are applied, instead of complex differential equations, to calculate the rates of the most influencing reactions; this decreases substantially the calculation time. Using this new approach, the dissociation and vibrational kinetics are captured in a reduced set of 44 reactions among 13 species. The predictions of the reduced kinetic model regarding the concentrations of the heavy species in the afterglow zone are in good agreement with those of the detailed model from which the former was derived.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Tim Lipman provided the technical analysis upon which this report is based. In recent years, political leaders, the media, and even some auto manufacturers have embraced hydrogen as the nation's best hope for addressing the rapidly accelerating threats posed by global warming and U.S. dependence on imported oil. Current enthusiasm for hydrogen is largely predicated on its potential advantages over petroleum as a future vehicle fuel. Proponents point out that hydrogen fuel produces far less air and global warming pollution than conventional fuels, and that it can be produced in America\u2014holding out the promise of energy independence. Less widely appreciated or discussed, however, is how hydrogen's costs and environmental benefits depend on where it comes from. Hydrogen cannot be found and extracted from the earth's crust. Rather, hydrogen must be made\u2014and how it is made matters. This report identifies current and proposed future sources of hydrogen, and examines the costs and environmental impacts of different methods of producing and using hydrogen as a means of assessing its desirability as a substitute for conventional fuels. 1 Our assessment shows that the least expensive and most developed methods of hydrogen production in use today are not necessarily environmentally sustainable. For example, one of the cheaper options currently available, producing hydrogen from coal without carbon capture and storage, will further aggravate the problem of global warming. The most sustainable ways to produce hydrogen in the future are from wind, solar, and biomass resources, and, under certain circumstances, from fossil-fuel sources with carbon capture and storage. However, there are significant hurdles that stand in the way of commercializing clean and sustainable means of producing hydrogen, as well as developing the vehicle technologies required to efficiently store and use hydrogen, and building the extensive infrastructure that would be needed to support its widespread use in motor vehicles. As a result, it will take at least two decades before hydrogen can even begin to make a significant contribution to reducing global warming pollution, improving air quality, and reducing U.S. oil dependence.

Secure, reliable and affordable energy supplies are needed for economic growth, but increases in the associated carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are the cause of major concern. About 69% of all CO2 emissions, and 60% of all greenhouse gas emissions, are energy-related.1 Recent IEA analysis projects that the CO2 emissions attributable to the energy sector will increase by 130% by 2050 in the absence of new policies or supply constraints, largely as a result of increased fossil fuel usage.2 The 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report indicates that such a rise in emissions could lead to a temperature increase in the range of 4-7\u00b0C, with major impacts on the environment and human activity.3 It is widely agreed that a 50% reduction in energy-related CO2 emissions is needed by 2050 to limit the expected temperature increase to less than 3 degrees Celsius. To achieve this will take an energy technology revolution involving increased energy efficiency, increased renewable energies and nuclear power, and the decarbonisation of power generation from fossil fuels. The only technology available to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from large-scale fossil fuel usage is CO2 capture and storage. 4 The IEA believes that CCS will need to contribute one-fifth of the necessary emissions reductions to reduce global GHG emissions by 50% by 2050 at low cost.5 CCS is therefore essential to the achievement of deep emission cuts.

The model simulates the observed elemental plasticity of phytoplankton and the relatively constant, lower C:N of heterotrophic biomass. In addition, the model captures the observed decreases in the C:N of more labile dissolved organic matter (DOM) and the C:N of its remineralization with depth, which are driven by a switch in the dominant source of DOM from phytoplankton to heterotrophic biomass. Only a model version with targeted remineralization of N\u2010rich components is able to simulate the observed profiles of preferential remineralization of N relative to C and the elevated C:N of bulk DOM. The model suggests that more labile substrates are associated with C\u2010limited heterotrophic growth and not with preferential remineralization, while less labile substrates are associated with growth limited by processing rates and with preferential remineralization. The resulting patterns of variable remineralization stoichiometry mediate the extent to which a proportional increase in carbon production resulting from changes in phytoplankton stoichiometry can increase the efficiency of the biological pump.

Key points: \u2022 A system-wide perspective, informed by modelling, is highly relevant because complex energy systems are made more inter-dependent by emissions reduction objectives \u2022 Efforts to cut emissions are substitutable across a national energy system encompassing power, heat, transport and infrastructure. \u2022 Energy systems are subject to key decision points and it is important to make the right choices in major long lived investments \u2022 Policy makers should place policy in a system-wide context. The ETI\u2019s current ESME-based analysis of the UK energy system shows that \u2022 Decarbonisation can be achieved affordably (at around 0.6% of GDP), provided that the most cost-effective technologies and strategies to reduce emissions are deployed \u2022 A broad portfolio of technologies is needed to deliver emissions reductions, with bio-energy and carbon capture and storage of particular system-wide importance Policy makers can use energy system modelling to inform market and policy design, increase understanding of pathways (including the impacts of \u2018real world\u2019 constraints and inertia in deploying technology), and identify key \u2018contender\u2019 technologies with particular system-wide value.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "d9b42451493fed3437d5549c2d194842b22c198c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3023578147", "DOI": "10.1039/d0nj01231a", "CorpusId": 219046117}, "title": "High-performance carbon dioxide capture and storage by multi-functional sphingosine kinase inhibitors through a CO2-philic membrane", "abstract": "The \u201call in one\u201d environmentally friendly sphingosine kinase inhibitor (SphKI) molecule could combine the advantages of various organic functional groups, and ambiphilic and amphipathic nature together for effective carbon dioxide (CO2) capture. The CO2 molecule interacts with various functional molecules including aromatic and multi-heteroatom (such as nitrogen and oxygen) systems through both physical and chemical absorption. In this study, the ability of SphKI with multiple reaction centers to bind CO2 is investigated using symmetry-adapted perturbation theory and a non-covalent interaction approach. The combination of these two analyses allowed us to explore the nature and strength of the SphKI\u22efCO2 interactions. We found that the variety of functional groups in SphKI including guanidine, oxadiazole, phenyl, and alkyl groups allowed it to act as both an electrophile and a nucleophile (ambiphilic nature) for the CO2 physisorption. But on the other hand, the chemisorption of CO2 by SphKI only proceeded through the guanidine group in the polar head (hydrophilic) region. These results revealed that the interaction energy values are divided into physical interactions with a binding energy in the range of \u223c2\u201332 kJ mol\u22121, which are mainly dominated by both electrostatic and dispersion contributions, and chemical interactions (\u223c16\u201345 kJ mol\u22121). Also, according to the amphipathic nature of SphKIs, a simple sphingosine-based membrane is proposed and shown to be stable by molecular dynamics simulation under aqueous conditions. By considering the chemical equilibrium between CO2 and water (H2CO3 (aq)), we used the proposed membrane to evaluate the large scale CO2-capturing efficacy of SphKIs. The simulation results showed that the CO2 molecules can diffuse into the hydrophobic phase of the SphKI membrane, while the H2CO3 molecules remain in the aqueous phase.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "82bd56398740d0f5df7fe24207be01c717087a42", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "8423686", "DOI": "10.1007/s00114-021-01748-8", "CorpusId": 237432383, "PubMed": "34491425"}, "title": "Societal importance of Antarctic negative feedbacks on climate change: blue carbon gains from sea ice, ice shelf and glacier losses", "abstract": "Diminishing prospects for environmental preservation under climate change are intensifying efforts to boost capture, storage and sequestration (long-term burial) of carbon.

In contrast, blue carbon on polar continental shelves have stronger pathways to sequestration and have increased with climate-forced marine ice losses\u2014becoming the largest known natural negative feedback on climate change. Here we explore the size and complex dynamics of blue carbon gains with spatiotemporal changes in sea ice (60\u2013100 MtCyear\u22121), ice shelves (4\u201340 MtCyear\u22121\u2009=\u2009giant iceberg generation) and glacier retreat (<\u20091 MtCyear\u22121). Estimates suggest that, amongst these, reduced duration of seasonal sea ice is most important. Decreasing sea ice extent drives longer (not necessarily larger biomass) smaller cell-sized phytoplankton blooms, increasing growth of many primary consumers and benthic carbon storage\u2014where sequestration chances are maximal. However, sea ice losses also create positive feedbacks in shallow waters through increased iceberg movement and scouring of benthos. Unlike loss of sea ice, which enhances existing sinks, ice shelf losses generate brand new carbon sinks both where giant icebergs were, and in their wake. These also generate small positive feedbacks from scouring, minimised by repeat scouring at biodiversity hotspots. Blue carbon change from glacier retreat has been least well quantified, and although emerging fjords are small areas, they have high storage-sequestration conversion efficiencies, whilst blue carbon in polar waters faces many diverse and complex stressors. The identity of these are known (e.g. fishing, warming, ocean acidification, non-indigenous species and plastic pollution) but not their magnitude of impact.

But here, on the eastern edge of that CO 2 hot spot, a new fossil fuel power plant showcases a potential remedy for Houston\u2019s outsized greenhouse gas footprint. The facility looks suspiciously like its forebears, a complex the size of two U.S. football fields, chocka-block with snaking pipes and pumps. It has a turbine and a combustor. But there is one thing it doesn\u2019t need: smokestacks. Zero-emission fossil fuel power sounds like an oxymoron. But when that 25-megawatt demonstration plant is fired up later this year, it will burn natural gas in pure oxygen. The result: a stream of nearly pure CO 2 , which can be piped away and stored underground or blasted into depleted oil reservoirs to free more oil, a process called enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Either way, the CO 2 will be sequestered from the atmosphere and the climate. That has long been the hope for carbon capture and storage (CCS), a strategy that climate experts say will be necessary if the world is to make any headway in limiting climate change (see sidebar, p. 798). But CCS systems bolted to conventional fossil fuel plants have struggled to take off because CO 2 makes up only a small fraction of their exhaust. Capturing it saps up to 30% of a power plant\u2019s energy and drives up the cost of electricity.

Stacked sandstone and shale layers provide large potential storage volumes and defense-in-depth leakage protection. Two types of traps are important in the initial sequestration stages: (1) closed structural and stratigraphic traps analogous to oil and gas traps, and (2) open traps where the residual saturation trail of capillary trapping is the main active mechanism. Leakage pathways of primary concern are wellbores and faults. Both could produce a direct connection to the atmosphere. However, most faults do not reach the surface, leaving abandoned wellbores the main focus of a risk analysis. Other leakage pathways, such as a closed trap overflowing through spill points or a seal failure, can be accommodated by the capillary trapping mechanism. The effectiveness of this mechanism depends on the level of heterogeneity of the formations. Determining formation heterogeneity is the second emphasis of any risk analysis in the Texas Gulf Coast.

A portion of the atoms were converted to protons by passage through an argon-filled gas cell, and the proton beam was then electrostatically analyzed. Energy distributions of the circulating protons were obtained by transformations applied to the measured distributions.For both gas and carbon arc dissociation the energy distributions were strong functions of the injected H2+ current and the location of the region of sampling relative to the median plane. A number of curves are shown illustrating these dependences.With arc dissociation, the circulating protons lost energy at a rate of about 20 keV/ms with 0.1 mA injected current, and at a rate twice this value when the current was increased to 2.3 mA. Most of the 20 keV/ms loss rate is believed to be due to coulomb collisions of the circulating protons with electrons in the dissociating arc. This loss rate is within a factor of two of that calculated on the basis of loss to electrons of a Maxwellian distribution, well within the accuracy of the arc parameters used in the calculation. Several mechanisms that might account for the additional energy loss rate at higher currents are suggested, but details of the origin of this loss are as yet unclear. The additional energy loss had the consequence of decreasing the mean storage time of the circulating protons.Measurements with gas dissociation also showed an increase in the rate of energy loss with injected current.With either arc or gas dissociation, the response of the energy distributions to changes in injected H2+ current indicated the presence of a non-collisional dispersing mechanism which increases in importance with increases in injected current.

The concept is built on the perspective that it would be hard to reduce drastically the future anthropogenic CO2 emissions with our continued reliance to fossil fuel energy sources. Actually, with an existing scrubbing method to treat the flue gases of fuel-burning power plants, fossil fuel CO2 can be concentrated and liquefied with a rough cost estimate of 5000 JPY per tonne of CO2. It should be noted that there is no technical barrier envisioned for the implementation of this option either in dissolving CO2 in the mid-water of the ocean or placing it on the oceanic floor (Ohsumi, 2003). In a large employment of this technology, the cost of transport and injection of CO2 into the sea is less than 2000JPY per tonne of CO2. After all, with the expenditure equivalent to 0.1% of GDP, Japanese CO2 emission could be reduced by several percents. With this technical and economical feasibility taken into account, our urgent mission is to examine the biological consequence of CO2 stored in the ocean. The ocean sequestration option could be considered as one of the global warming mitigation measures through carbon management activity.

Here, we explore this uncertainty in a comparison study between two fault-sealed fields located in the Otway Basin, SE Australia. The Katnook Field in the Penola Trough is a methane field, while Boggy Creek in Port Campbell contains a high-CO2\u2013methane mixture. Two industry standard fault seal modelling methods, one based on laboratory measurements of fault samples and the other based on a calibration of a global dataset of known sealing faults, are used to discuss their relative strengths and applicability to the CO2 storage context.

Ab immobilizations were carried out in oriented/non-oriented manner using commercial activated surfaces with N-hydroxysuccinic ester (NHS-surfaces) or homemade surfaces using three generations of dendrimers (dendrigraft of poly L-lysine (DGL) surfaces). The performances of the Ab -based surfaces were cross-compared on the following criteria: (i) analytical performances (expressed by both the surface density of immobilized Abs and the amount of antigens initially captured by the surface) and (ii) resistance of surfaces to preparation procedure (freeze-drying, storage) or spatial constraints (irradiation and temperature shifts) encountered during a space mission. The latter results have been expressed as percentage of surface binding capacity losses (or percentage of remaining active Abs). The highest amount of captured antigen was achieved with Ab surfaces having full-length Abs and DGL-surfaces that have much higher surface densities than commercial NHS-surface. After freeze-drying process, thermal shift and storage sample exposition, we found that more than 80% of surface binding sites remained active in this case.

Here, we present marine palynomorph (dinoflagellate cysts, acritarchs) data extracted mainly from cutting samples of eight industry wells that cover the entire distribution area of the Utsira Formation to provide an age and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction for this unit. We conclude that deposits classified as Utsira Formation are Late Miocene/Early Pliocene to Early Pleistocene in age. Early Pliocene sediments are found mainly in the Viking Graben area, whereas sediments with an Early Pleistocene age occur over the entire distribution area of the Utsira Formation. All sediments were deposited in neritic environments that gradually became shallower from the Early Pliocene to the Pleistocene. At the same time, the dinoflagellate cysts also indicate a cooling that corresponds well with late Neogene global cooling. Precise dating of the Utsira Formation is difficult, but this can be improved by (1) using samples from cored section (in contrast to using cuttings), (2) a clear and unquestionable lithological definition of the Utsira Formation and (3) a continuous, calibrated reference section in the Neogene North Sea for comparison of the bioevents.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "5983d6dcd991888eca1955914869d27dd90c5555", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2626874196", "DOI": "10.1080/02827581.2017.1342859", "CorpusId": 90447357}, "title": "Trade-offs in sustainability impacts of introducing cascade use of wood", "abstract": "ABSTRACT The aim of this study was to analyse the sustainability impacts of allocating material from energy use to material use by adding cascaded wood into production of wood products. A case study is presented, where we analyse sustainability impacts of cascade use alternatives compared to the non-cascade use practice in particleboard production within the province of North Karelia, Finland. Direct impacts are captured using sustainability indicators representing environmental, economic and social aspects of sustainability. Results show that introducing cascaded wood can increase carbon storage in wood products, employment and production costs. Energy use and GHG emissions increase as well, when the total industrial activity during the lifetime of wood increases. We conclude that cascade use can improve resource efficiency as it enables the use of wood multiple times before combustion; however, the amount of waste wood for energy generation decreases locally, and alternative sources of energy need to be identified.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "a0d07ffce259cffebca4cb984ee656de3781e981", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 201024523}, "title": "Carbon farming and credit for mitigating greenhouse gases", "abstract": "Carbon farming describes a collection of eco-friendly techniques that have the ability to increase carbon sink into soil, i.e. carbon sequestration. Increasing C sink in the soil will help reduce the amount of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions in the environment. Carbon farming that leads to reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is referred to as abatement activities. It holds carbon in vegetation and soils, and reduces GHG emissions. A carbon offset credit is a payment made by an emitter of carbon (a power plant, mine, oil refinery, etc.) to the developer or owner of a carbon sequestration process (owner of a forest reserve, biochar project developer, etc.). Carbon farming includes a single change in land management, such as zero tillage, agroforestry, methane-reducing feed supplements or stubble retention which maximizes capture of carbon and reduction of emissions. In carbon farming, the amounts of CO2, CH4 and N2O will be reduced with increasing C sinks in the soil because of increased soil aeration from organic carbon addition, which reduces denitrification and increases sink capacity for CH4. Soil organic carbon adds electron acceptors and increases the redox-potential of the soil to decrease its N2O source capacity. Carbon farming induces microbial immobilization of available N2 in the soil, which decreases N2O source capacity of the soil. In carbon farming, there are some promising options that reduce GHG emissions; storage of carbon in soils and degraded rangelands through forests, tree plantings and regrowth, carbon storage through incorporation of biochar which is carbonnegative, and substitution of biofuels for fossil fuels. Carbon farming gives land managers an opportunity to earn carbon credits through carbon storing or reducing GHG emissions on their own land. These carbon credits can then be sold to the Government-nominated authority who wishes to offset their emissions. Actually carbon farming is a voluntary carbon offsets scheme that provides economic rewards to landholders who take steps to reduce GHG emissions. Carbon farming reduces emissions by sequestration, where carbon is stored on land, and emissions avoidance, which prevents the GHG emissions from entering the atmosphere. It involves implementing practices which improve the rate at which CO2 is removed from the atmosphere and converted to plant material and/or soil organic matter. Carbon farming is successful when the gain of carbon resulting from enhanced land management and/or conservation practices exceeds the carbon losses. Its benefit includes GHG reduction, carbon sequestration, increased biodiversity, buffering against drought and greater water efficiency. Development of different programmes will facilitate the buying and selling of carbon credits between landholders and Government agencies. Landholders receive carbon credits for storing carbon in the soil and then the credits are assembled and sold desiring to reduce emissions. These credits are often bought independently of an exchange, and can boost the financial status of the client, and help prove how the practices are useful in mitigating the effects of the industrial society. Initiatives by the Government of India may allow the land managers to earn carbon credits by reducing GHG emissions and storing carbon in vegetation and soil through carbon farming. Besides this, it may also allow landholders to generate offset credits from activities that reduce emissions or sequester carbon. The huge emitters will be able to utilize credits generated through carbon farming to meet their emission reduction targets. The production of biochar from farm waste and their application in soils may offer financial and environmental benefits. Once environmental cost of carbon-based GHG emission has been suitably internalized, we can expect market forces and the price mechanism. Considering the urgent need to take action on climate change, it is recommended to include carbon farming in the portfolio of mitigation strategies. Thus, carbon farming may serve as a promising mitigation strategy deserving much attention as many other geoengineering options.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "5400609eeb32289738ce0d1aec4d6bfff5aa4652", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2399037869", "DOI": "10.1039/9781847559715-00041", "CorpusId": 133211486}, "title": "Chapter 2:Fossil Power Generation with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): Policy Development for Technology Deployment", "abstract": "In recent years, there has been growing concern that carbon dioxide (and other greenhouse gas) emissions from fossil fuel use could cause dangerous climate change, with serious negative impacts on human activities.1,2 In this context, it is expected that the net CO2 emissions from fossil fuels must ...", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "d0b3aff2ed692bcb596e9359142e48c6066e2c90", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3011148877", "DOI": "10.34257/GJHSSHVOL20IS2PG17", "CorpusId": 212422663}, "title": "Making use of CO2 Capture for Saving Earth and Human - A Comparison of \u201cCarbon Capture and Storage--CCS \u201dand\u201c Sarbon Capture and Storage Energy--CCSE\u201d", "abstract": "Two technical routes of \u201cCarbon Capture and StorageCCS\u201d with \u201cCarbon Capture and Storage Energy-CCSE\u201d or \u201cSmoke Storage Energy-SSE\u201d have compared.

This family of materials \u2014 which can be most simply described as infinite networks of metal ions or clusters held together by organic linkers \u2014 first garnered attention on account of the ultrahigh porosity and surface area that some of them exhibit. Together with great scope for chemical functionalization, such properties immediately suggested possible future applications in gas storage, separation and catalysis. Indeed, research has since developed to the point where there are now a broad array of exciting candidates for implementation in real-world systems. The potential capabilities of these materials are frequently cited in grant applications and scientific papers. Indeed, there are credible claims that MOF-enabled technologies can resolve some of the grand challenges of our age \u2014 particularly those associated with issues concerning energy and the environment. These include carbon capture as a means to curb climate change, low-pressure gas storage for portable fuels (especially relevant for a feasible hydrogen economy) and catalytic break down of toxic species to name a few. And yet there is a growing contingent of naysayers who suggest that MOFs have promised much and delivered little, and furthermore that the barriers to the realization of genuine MOF-based solutions to these problems are insurmountable. Contrary to this perception, some companies have already demonstrated strong proof-ofconcept studies and, more recently, have even released products to the market. The chemical company BASF took an interest in MOFs following high-profile publications in Science1 and Nature2 in 1999; they soon struck up a collaboration with Omar Yaghi, currently at the University of California, Berkeley. As a result of this partnership, BASF developed a MOF-based natural gas storage system which, since 2013, they have been testing in a fleet of demonstration vehicles3. Although economic pressures may not currently favour methane fuels, indications are that this technology is getting very close to the market4. In July of this year, Decco announced5 the registration of TruPick \u2014 a post-harvest freshness management tool for fruit and vegetables \u2014 with the US Environmental Protection Agency. Details of the product were revealed6 in September at the 5th International Conference on Metal\u2013Organic Frameworks & Open Framework Compounds (MOF2016) in California. The product, enabled by their partner MOF Technologies \u2014 a spin-out company from Queens University Belfast \u2014 uses a MOF adsorbent for the storage and release of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), which is a competitive inhibitor for the ethylene receptor found on the surface of some fruit. In large storage facilities, ethylene is released by ripening fruit, which in turn accelerates the ripening process in the surrounding fruit and can cause significant problems with premature aging. The strong binding of 1-MCP can, however, significantly prolong the time for which fruit can be safely stored by up to nine months. TruPick is already being used in the USA and our American readers could be eating September\u2019s harvest of apples in March next year; registration in other countries is expected soon, with Turkey\u2019s having already been received. MOF Technologies are now in the process of scaling up their solvent-free mechanochemical production capabilities to 100 kg per week across a range of MOFs. Rather than act as a MOF provider, NuMat Technologies \u2014 a company spun out of Northwestern University \u2014 took a different approach and chose to deliver a complete MOF-integrated product ready for the market. Also at MOF2016, NuMat announced the launch of a system for the storage of hazardous gases that are typically used in the electronics industry. During the conference, ION-X cylinders were already on their way to customers. We interview Omar Farha and Ben Hernandez from NuMat on page 990 of this issue, where you can read more about how the company came about, and what strategies they needed to implement to get to this point. With at least two companies now taking products to market, it seems that a critical developmental stage has been reached in the maturity of MOF research. There remain many hurdles before some of the most globally significant goals can be reached, but these early footsteps by MOF pioneers into the brutally competitive arena of technology commercialization will surely pave the way for others to do the same. Moreover, by following through on promises to make MOF-enabled products that can deliver tangible societal benefits \u2014 as well as the sustainability that comes with commercial revenue \u2014 the example set by the scientists and engineers behind these companies should encourage funding agencies and private investors to continue to support research in this area. \u2750", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "ccfd05a9372cdeb5c822e1f897d6710966128131", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 4846909}, "title": "CO 2 storage risk assessment : feasibility study of the systemic method", "abstract": "The current environmental background is modifying human behaviour in every society.

This is a technique which extends the use of fossil energies while giving necessary time for renewable energies to develop on a large scale. The CO2 is captured, brought to the storage site, and injected either into dried up oil and gas deposits or into unworkable coal seams or into deep saline aquifers.

The environmental benefits of UCG are mainly due to eliminating (i) conventional mining operations, (ii) the presence of coal miners in the underground, (iii) coal washing and fines disposal, and (iv) coal stockpiling and coal transportation activities. Furthermore, UCG has a capacity of great potential to provide a clean coal energy source by the implementing carbon capture and storage techniques as part of the energy extraction process. In this method, coal seams in the underground were converted into syngas including hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane (CH4) gasses with an advanced thermochemical process. UCG operation effected significant geomechanical changes to the overburden strata. In this process, the vertical well (especially the production well) was mainly affected by the mechanical stresses and the thermal stress, induced by the high syngas temperature. This high temperature changed the mechanical, thermal, and physical properties of the coal seam and its surrounding rocks (the host rocks), finally causing instability of the vertical well, while leading to serious production and environmental problems. One of these environmental issues is the possibility of syngas leakage in to the environment, resulting in water pollution and acidification. In addition, the released syngas could trigger global warming and air pollution. This research evaluated environmental aspects of UCG vertical well (production well) based on the stability analysis. Therefore, a flow sheet form was developed for three-dimensional thermomechanical numerical modeling of an UCG vertical well by explicit Lagrangian finite difference method. In this model, a criterion was established based on normalized yielded zone area to assess the stability conditions. The methodology was able to capture all factors that influence the instability of UCG well while selecting suitable mud pressure and lining system during the well drilling process. Hence, when wellbore integrity issues arose during drilling, the mitigation strategies were applied to rectify these problems. The results demonstrated that the vertical well should be drilled at a constant mud pressure of 9\u00a0MPa (megapascal), thus causing minimum environmental problems.

The work sought to identify plant designs with promising (Nth plant) economics, superior environmental footprints, and the potential to be deployed at scale as a means for simultaneously achieving enhanced energy security and deep reductions in U.S. GHG emissions in the coming decades. Designs included systems using primarily already-commercialized component technologies, which may have the potential for near-term deployment at scale, as well as systems incorporating some advanced technologies at various stages of R&D. All of the coproduction designs have the common attribute of producing some electricity and also of capturing CO{sub 2} for storage. For each of the co-product pairs detailed process mass and energy simulations (using Aspen Plus software) were developed for a set of alternative process configurations, on the basis of which lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, Nth plant economic performance, and other characteristics were evaluated for each configuration. In developing each set of process configurations, focusedmore\u00a0\u00bb attention was given to understanding the influence of biomass input fraction and electricity output fraction. Self-consistent evaluations were also carried out for gasification-based reference systems producing only electricity from coal, including integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and integrated gasification solid-oxide fuel cell (IGFC) systems. The reason biomass is considered as a co-feed with coal in cases when gasoline or olefins are co-produced with electricity is to help reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for these systems. Storing biomass-derived CO{sub 2} underground represents negative CO{sub 2} emissions if the biomass is grown sustainably (i.e., if one ton of new biomass growth replaces each ton consumed), and this offsets positive CO{sub 2} emissions associated with the coal used in these systems. Different coal:biomass input ratios will produce different net lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for these systems, which is the reason that attention in our analysis was given to the impact of the biomass input fraction. In the case of systems that produce only products with no carbon content, namely electricity, ammonia and hydrogen, only coal was considered as a feedstock because it is possible in theory to essentially fully decarbonize such products by capturing all of the coal-derived CO{sub 2} during the production process.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "d99a8b03c150932dc81a7815a85897c0fbe9df90", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2953789944", "DOI": "10.4324/9780203888469-12", "CorpusId": 198405909}, "title": "CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE", "abstract": null, "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "d9fbb13b93cde53fe7578df7cc16448f86f9d957", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2766716852", "DOI": "10.1787/9789264096684-9-en", "CorpusId": 139554700}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "7ac0e09ecf7acd903e4b08496e19903592109196", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3009677158", "DOI": "10.1007/s11814-019-0465-x", "CorpusId": 211729712}, "title": "Carbon capture by alkaline absorbent using octadecyltrichlorosilane modified PVDF/TiO2 membrane", "abstract": "Carbon capture efficiency of membrane gas absorption was improved using a nearly superhydrophobic membrane.

Peatland emissions associated with land-use change, and fires are closely related to changes in the water table level. Remote sensing is a powerful tool that is potentially useful for estimating peat CO2 emissions over large spatial and temporal scales. We related ground measurements of total soil respiration and water table depth collected over 19\u00a0months in an Indonesian peatland to remotely sensed gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) terrestrial water storage anomoly (TWSA) data. GRACE TWSA can be used to predict changes in water storage on land.

In both ecosystem types, total soil respiration increased with increasing water table depth. Across the landscape grid, monthly changes in water table depth were significantly related to fluctuations in GRACE TWSA. GRACE TWSA explained 76% of variation in water table depth and 75% of variation in total soil respiration measured on the ground. By facilitating regular sampling across broad spatial scales that captures essential variation in a major driver of soil respiration and peat fires, our approach could improve information available to decision makers to monitor changes in water table depth and peat CO2 emissions.

Ultrathin double-shell nanotubes of titanium oxide with oxygen-vacancy@nitrogen-doped carbon (denoted as OV-TiO2\u2212x@NC) as the sulfur host were designed. As demonstrated by experimental and computational results, an ultrathin TiO2\u2212x shell featuring a small aspect ratio can not only provide rapid charge transfer but also shorten the diffusion pathway of lithium ions. Furthermore, the special double-shell nanostructure with the large surface area can accommodate high number of sulfur species, provide effective channels for the electrolyte penetration, supply adequate buffer space for alleviating the volume expansion of sulfur upon repeated cycling, and provide both physical and chemical adsorption to efficiently capture LiPSs. The OV-TiO2\u2212x inner shell with a small aspect ratio is compactly packed and tightly adhered to the carbon layer, which can effectively anchor LiPSs with strong chemical affinity and prevent their diffusion from the inner to the outside layer. More importantly, the introduction of oxygen-vacancies can enhance the conductivity of electrode, restrict the loss of LiPSs into the electrolyte, strengthen electrocatalytic activity, and accelerate LiPSs conversion.

However, these reactions also cause major emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2, which is generally believed to be responsible for global warming. The separation of H2/CO2 from gaseous streams with subsequent CO2 sequestration meets demands for significant reductions of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. The disadvantages of common H2/CO2 separation technologies (such as amine scrubbing and pressure swing adsorption) include high energy costs, consumption of sorbents, and complicated processing. Consequently, there is a compelling need for the development of more viable and effective H2/ CO2 separation technologies. [2] Inorganic membrane-based gas separation offers an environment-friendly alternative to conventional separation technologies owing to its high energy efficiency and high performance, that is, flux and selectivity, at elevated temperatures. 4] Such membranes generally consist of a thin separation layer (with a thickness that can range from a few tens of nanometers up to a few micrometers) superimposed onto a mechanically strong porous support. Several materials (e.g. , palladium and its alloys, carbon, zeolites, and sol\u2013 gel derived ceramic membranes) have been suggested for hydrogen purification and carbon capture; among these, amorphous silica with pore sizes in the range of 2\u20135 is one of the most promising materials. However, the modest hydrothermal stability of membranes made from pure silica severely limits their application under humid conditions. Several methods have been put forward to enhance their stability in the presence of hot steam. Imparting excellent hydrothermal stability to microporous membranes while retaining their flux and molecular sieving properties remains one of the main challenges in the field of membrane research. 6] Humidity can disrupt the Si O Si bonds in silica, inducing densification of the micropourous silica network owing to the formation of mobile silica fragments. Different research groups have undertaken numerous attempts to improve the hydrothermal stability of sol\u2013gel derived microporous silica membranes, including (1) modification of the amorphous silica matrix by doping with metal or transition-metal ions (e.g. , Ni, Co, Mg, Al, Zr, Ti, Fe, Nb, and others) ; (2) dispersion of methyl ( CH3) functional groups into the silica matrix, so as to make its structure more hydrophobic; 10] and (3) use of alternatives to tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) as the source for the alkoxide, such as transition-metal alkoxides or bridged bis-silyl precursors. None of these attempts have succeeded in developing a high-enough membrane performance combined with a sufficient long-term hydrothermal stability to the degree required for application to industrially relevant gas streams and temperatures. Herein, we report on sol\u2013gel derived microporous hybrid inorganic\u2013organic membranes for enhanced CO2 separation. These are prepared by co-hydrolysis and condensation of the ethylene-bridged bis-silyl precursor 1,2-bis(triethoxysilyl)-ethane (BTESE) and niobium penta(n)butoxide, and subsequent coating of the polymeric sol on an alumina-based multilayer support. The present work was inspired by observations made in two earlier investigations. Firstly, Kanazashi et al. 14] recently employed ethylene-bridged silsesquioxanes for the fabrication of microporous membranes. Evaluation showed that the hybrid silica membranes exhibit a high structural stability under hydrated conditions owing to the Si CH2 CH2 Si bridged construction of the silica network, albeit at the expense of selectivity, compared to that found for pure silica. Secondly, high H2/CO2 and He/CO2 selectivities were found for microporous silica membranes upon doping with niobium oxide, as reported by Boffa et al. 16] A similar behavior was found for the hybrid analogue of the niobium-doped silica membranes prepared in this study. Both high acidity and water-tolerant properties are known characteristics of niobiumcontaining materials, which are extensively studied as heterogeneous catalysts. 18] Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acid sites coexist when niobium oxide is dispersed in siliceous host structures. Data from the present study indicate that niobium doping of the hybrid silica network reduces the net adsorption of CO2. The altered density and strength of the acidic surface centers imparted by niobium doping is hypothesized to play a causal role. The niobium-doped hybrid membranes developed in this study combine high selectivity and high hydrothermal stability, and therefore hold great promise for H2/CO2 separation under industrial conditions. Dynamic light scattering was employed to probe the particle size distribution of the Nb-doped hybrid silica sols (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The particle size found was in the range 1\u201330 nm, with an average size of approximately 5.9 nm. Storage at 20 8C over two months entailed no apparent change of the particle size, while the sol was still clear and [a] Dr. H. Qi, J. Han, Prof. N.

The present paper discusses some of these issues, proposing an analysis of what the concept means from the standpoint of materials stakeholders and how it can be refined or nuanced with a practical approach in mind. The core of the Circular Economy is the recycling of materials, which are recovered from the collection of end-of-life (EoL) investment or consumer goods. The key word is therefore recycling of EoL goods, materials, metals, minerals, residues and by-products and also molecules, like CO or CO2 (Carbon Capture Use and Storage, CCUS). Recycling brings materials savings and reduces the need for virgin resources (primary raw materials). When materials are recycled to the same material, other environmental benefits can also be collected, like energy savings, greenhouse gas emission reduction and a smaller environmental footprint in general. The kind of recycling that ought to be privileged is therefore that which improves all of these indicators at the same time, thus material-to-the-same material recycling. The circular economy should be described material by material, in order to analyze in detail what is already being done and what can still be improved: the various materials achieve very different levels of recycling and thus policies for going beyond present achievements will differ according to each material. The circular economy has an important time dimension, as many materials are stocked in the economy for long times, sometimes half a century or more. The lifespan of the material stocks means that high recycling rates today will be translated into high-recycled contents only in the future, sometimes in the long time. The Circular Economy is a long-time endeavor! There are two important tools for dealing with these issues, LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) and MFA (Materials Flow Analysis). They incorporate the cycle time of recycling but need to be expanded into dynamic LCA and MFA in order to become fully time-dependent. Policies founded on LCA at a microeconomic scale, and MFA at a macro-economic scale are the most apt to mirror how the socio-economic system works and thus to avoid negative rebound effects. Fostering the use of these tools is an important element in encouraging the Circular Economy. But it is also important to understand that the rationale for moving in this direction is environmental and political, not necessarily economical. Thus it will not be enough to foster technological R&D (Research & Development) and to achieve R&I (Research & Innovation): tools to internalize these externalities in the market economy will need to be introduced more widely.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "db8da5fa8f66cbd8b6579b8b22e5d222f29ab68b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2980096563", "DOI": "10.1002/chem.201903926", "CorpusId": 204243660, "PubMed": "31603596"}, "title": "Effect of Building Block Transformation in Covalent Triazine Based Frameworks for Enhanced CO2 Uptake and Metal Free Heterogeneous Catalysis.", "abstract": "Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) have provided a unique platform in functional material design for a wide range of applications.

We find drastic power system carbon emission reductions to be feasible by 2050 under a wide range of possible futures. The average cost of power in 2050 is found to range between $149/MWh and $232/MWh across scenarios, a 21 to 88 % increase relative to a business-as-usual scenario, and a 38 to 115 % increase relative to the present-day cost of power. In order to rapidly decarbonize, the power system undergoes sweeping change. Between present-day and 2030, the evolution of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) power system is dominated by the implementation of aggressive energy efficiency measures, the installation of renewable energy and gas-fired generation facilities, and the retirement of coal-fired generation. In the 2040 time frame, deployment of wind, solar, and geothermal power reduce power system emissions by displacing gas-fired generation. In the 2050 time frame this deployment trend continues for wind and solar, but is accompanied by large amounts of new storage and long-distance, high-voltage transmission capacity. In stark contrast to present-day operation, electricity storage is used primarily to move solar energy from the daytime into the night in order to charge electric vehicles and meet demand from electrified heating. Transmission capacity over the California border is increased by 40 - 220 % by 2050, implying that transmission siting, permitting, and regional cooperation will become increasingly important over time. California remains a net electricity importer in all scenarios investigated. Wind and solar power are key elements in power system decarbonization, providing 37 - 56 % and 17 - 32 % of energy generated respectively across WECC in 2050 if no new nuclear capacity is built. In an effort to integrate wind and solar resources, the amount of installed gas capacity remains relatively constant between present-day and 2050, though carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is installed on some gas plants by 2050.

Secondly, it produces liquid CO2 that can be pumped to the supercritical state, which is required for transport and sequestration.

To satisfy this demand, numerous new-builts are planned all around the world. Keeping the temperature-increase goal of 2\u00b0C for global warming in mind, this development calls for mature carbon-capture techniques that reduce the climate impact of fossil-fueled power stations. Among the most-advanced and -engineered solutions for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture are post-combustion absorption/desorption processes, usually with aqueous amine solutions as solvents (Blauwhoff et al. 1984; Kohl and Nielsen 1997; Rinker et al. 2000; da Silva and Svendsen 2004). The Technology Owner, as a modification, has developed the PostCapTM (post-combustion carbon-capture) process by use of an amino acid salt (AAS) dissolved in water as solvent. AASs are described by various authors as a promising alternative to conventional amines (e.g., Rochelle et al. 2001; van Holst et al. 2006; Abu Zhara 2009; Feron and Puxty 2011; Majchrowicz 2014). The advantages are that AASs are salts and are therefore nonvolatile, which eliminates the threat of inhalation and solvent loss through gas phase. Moreover, many AASs are naturally occurring substances that are nontoxic, nonexplosive, odorless, and biodegradable. This leads to exceptional benefits for the operability of AAS-based CO2-capture units. Capturing CO2 for climate-related reasons, however, is only one side of the story. The use of CO2 as a valuable product is one step forward. The yield from oil fields can be increased considerably by enhanced oil recovery (EOR), a tertiary method of injecting CO2 underground with high pressure and thus extracting oil. The oil/ CO2 mixture reaching ground level can be flashed off and separated by well-established technologies; the CO2 will be reinjected and will remain underground after a certain number of turnovers. Studies name a potential worldwide demand of 260 to 310 gigatons (Gt) of CO2 for EOR (Van Leeuwen 2011), which could even be extended up to 460 Gt by application to smaller oil fields (Godec 2011). The CO2 will be, finally, stored underground. The resulting oil yield is given in the studies to be approximately 880 to 1,050 billion bbl of oil (Van Leeuwen 2011) or even more than 1,500 billion bbl (Godec 2011). Near-term projections forecast an annual use of 124 megatons (Mt) of CO2 in the US only by 2020 (Wallace and Kuuskraa 2014). Aiming both at climate and economic benefits, Masdar has initiated the Abu Dhabi Carbon-Capture, -Usage, and -Storage Studies, with the objective to develop a carbon-capture network in Abu Dhabi capable of providing large reductions of CO2 emissions while providing CO2 for EOR purposes. Phase 1 of the project, the purification and transport of approximately 800,000 tons of CO2 annually emitted from a steelmaking process, has started construction and is planned to go into operation in 2016.

The migration of contamination materials in the underground environment, especially in porous rock mass, is governed mainly by water permeation and diffusion.

Scenarios of EU and global climate action to 2050 are quantified using the GEME3\u2010RD model, a global multi\u2010sectoral computable general equilibrium model with endogenous technology progress and detailed representation of the clean energy technologies. The model includes two\u2010factor learning curves (stock and research and development funding) for clean energy technologies, such as electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage, and renewable and efficient appliances. Funding of research and development is endogenously derived as a production factor enabling productivity improvement. The scenarios compare stylised climate strategies, which are asymmetric by world region and have different emission reduction profiles over time. Assuming that strong climate mitigation action will be undertaken only after 2030, the scenarios compare two main strategies for the EU: pursuing strong emission reduction unilaterally until 2030 versus deferring action for the period after 2030. Asymmetric climate action by region enables asymmetric innovation and manufacturing of clean energy technologies. The macroeconomic assessment of the climate action strategies does not only depend on costs of clean technologies but also on induced technology progress implying asymmetric effects on manufacturing and trade by region, taking into account spillovers. The model\u2010based projections show clear advantages for the EU as a first mover in climate change mitigation compared with a delaying of climate action until 2030. Delayed climate action until 2030 implies higher gross domestic product losses for the EU compared with unilateral action until 2030. The model finds benefits of early action by the EU driven by activity and progress related to clean energy technologies as the EU can achieve competitive advantages over other world regions pursuing climate action later.

CO2 is captured from large emission sources and injected and stored in deep reservoir rocks, including saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas field. Under typical pressure and temperature conditions at deep reservoirs (depths > 800m), CO2 will be stored in supercritical state, subsequently dissolving in groundwater, and eventually forming carbonate minerals through geochemical reactions in a long-term (e.g., thousands of years). To ensure the safety and permanence of the storage, numerical simulation is considered as the most powerful approach for predicting the long-term fate of CO2 in reservoirs. A parallelized general-purpose hydrodynamics code TOUGH2-MP has been used on scalar architectures where it exhibits excellent performance and scalability. However, on the Earth Simulator (ES2), which is a massively parallel vector computer, extensive tune-ups were required for increasing the vector operation ratio.

However, the longer time that climate action is delayed, the more the achievement of this goal will depend on Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies and practices. In the models behind these pathways, the main CDR technology is Bioenergy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). We review the role that BECCS could play in reaching net-zero targets based on the existing 1.5\u00b0C scenarios. Such scenarios presented in the literature typically have BECCS at a GtCO2 per year scale. We also assess the potentials and obstacles for BECCS implementation at the national level, applying Sweden as a case study. Given that BECCS deployment has scarcely started and, thus, is far from capturing 1 GtCO2 per year, with lead times on the scale of multiple years, we conclude that there will be a large implementation gap unless BECCS development is immediately intensified, emissions are reduced at a much faster pace or removals realized through other CDR measures. In the national case study, we show that Sweden has favorable conditions for BECCS in that it has large point sources of biogenic emissions, and that BECCS has been identified as one potential \u201csupplementary measure\u201d for reaching the Swedish target of net-zero emissions in 2045. Yet, work on planning for BECCS implementation has started only recently and would need to be accelerated to close the implementation gap between the present advancement and the targets for BECCS proposed in a recent public inquiry on the roles of supplementary measures. An assessment of two ramp-up scenarios for BECCS demonstrates that it should in principle be possible to reach the currently envisaged deployment scales, but this will require prompt introduction of political and economic incentives.

The main core of the thesis focuses on the experimental investigation of the dependence of interfacial tension on pressure and temperature, for various mixtures of pure substances relevant to oil-field conditions and fluids. For this purpose, a high pressure high temperature (HPHT) apparatus, comprising a view cell, high pressure capillary tubing connections, and appropriate fluid delivery syringe pumps, was used over an operating temperature range of (298 to 473) K and at pressures up to 60 MPa. The apparatus implemented the pendant drop method, well suited for the accurate determination of fluid/liquid interfacial tensions at elevated pressures and temperatures, linked to a computer-aided drop shape analysis (DSA) system. Measurements were made over a wide range of conditions for the twophase systems (H2O + CO2), (n-decane + CO2), (n-dodecane + CO2), (nhexadecane + CO2), (H2O +n-decane) and (H2O + [n-decane + CO2]). The different isotherms recorded for each system demonstrated systematic trends with increasing pressure, while the decrease of interfacial tension with temperature observed at ambient pressures was usually reversed at elevated pressures. For the (H2O + CO2) system in particular, the pressure dependence of interfacial tension demonstrated abrupt changes at certain conditions, associated with the onset of the liquid or supercritical states, above which the interfacial tension was less sensitive to changes in both pressure and temperature. This was not the case for the (n-alkane + CO2) systems, where the interfacial tension reduced with increasing pressure, vanishing as the two phases became miscible.

In many parts of the world, forest management has shifted from a focus on timber production to multi-purpose forestry, combining timber production with the supply of other forest ecosystem services. However, it is unclear which forest types provide which ecosystem services and to what extent forests primarily managed for timber already supply multiple ecosystem services. Based on a comprehensive dataset collected across 150 forest plots in three regions differing in management intensity and species composition, we develop models to predict the potential supply of 13 ecosystem services. We use those models to assess the level of multifunctionality of managed forests at the national level using national forest inventory data. Results Looking at the potential supply of ecosystem services, we found trade-offs (e.g. between both bark beetle control or dung decomposition and both productivity or soil carbon stocks) as well as synergies (e.g. for temperature regulation, carbon storage and culturally interesting plants) across the 53 most dominant forest types in Germany. No single forest type provided all ecosystem services equally. Some ecosystem services showed comparable levels across forest types (e.g. decomposition or richness of saprotrophs), while others varied strongly, depending on forest structural attributes (e.g. phosphorous availability or cover of edible plants) or tree species composition (e.g. potential nitrification activity). Variability in potential supply of ecosystem services was only to a lesser extent driven by environmental conditions. However, the geographic variation in ecosystem function supply across Germany was closely linked with the distribution of main tree species. Conclusions Our results show that forest multifunctionality is limited to subsets of ecosystem services. The importance of tree species composition highlights that a lack of multifunctionality at the stand level can be compensated by managing forests at the landscape level, when stands of complementary forest types are combined. These results imply that multi-purpose forestry should be based on a variety of forest types requiring coordinated planning across larger spatial scales.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "7b7581733f363cd3912ba1865ebed91feeb54a87", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2383522535", "CorpusId": 167700867}, "title": "Business Opportunities in Low Carbon Economy", "abstract": "The\"low-carbon economy\"brought enterprises unprecedented opportunities.In addition to energy saving,emission reduction and alternative energy,there were three main lines which included measurement of carbon footprints,carbon capture and storage,smart grid,and other emerging areas of forest carbon sinks.Enterprises should explore the best business model to grab business opportunities for their own development strategies based on low carbon.In the background of the coming low-carbon era,enterprises should re-examine the external environment in order to make scientific decisions,seize the opportunity.", "year": 2011}]}
