The decrease in decomposability (substrate quality) varies among species and is complex, involving both direct chemical changes in the substrate itself and the succession in microorganisms able to compete for substrate with a given chemical composition. In late stages, the decomposition appears very little affected by climate, suggesting that climate change will have little effect on late-stages decomposition rates. Here, we apply a model for the late stages of litter decomposition to address the question of climate-change effects on soil-C storage. Decomposition of litter turning into soil organic matter (SOM) is determined by the degradation rate of lignin. In the last phases of decay, raised N concentrations have a rate-retarding effect on lignin degradation and thus on the decomposition of far-decomposed litter and litter in near-humus stages. The retardation of the decomposition rate in late stages may be so strong that decomposition reaches a limit value at which total mass losses virtually stop. At such a stage the remaining litter would be close to that of stabilized SOM. The estimated limit values for different species range from about 45 to 100% decomposition indicating that between 0 and 55% should either be stabilized or decompose extremely slowly. For no less than 106 long-term studies on litter decomposition, encompassing 21 litter types, limit values were significantly and negatively related to N concentration, meaning that the higher the N concentration in the newly shed litter (the lower the C/N ratio) the more litter was left when it reached its limit value. Trees growing under warmer and wetter climates (higher actual evapotranspiration, AET) tend to shed foliar litter more rich in N than those growing under colder and drier climates. A change in climate resulting in higher AET would thus mean that within species, e.g., Scots pine, a higher N level in the foliar litter may result. Further, within the boreal system deciduous species appear to have foliar litter richer in N than have conifers and within the conifers group, Norway spruce has needle litter more rich in N than, e.g., Scots pine. Thus, a change of species (e.g., by planting) from pine to spruce or from spruce to a deciduous species such as birch may result in a higher N level in the litter fall at a given site. In both cases the result would be a lower limit value for decomposition. The paper presents an hypothesis, largely based on available data that a change in climate of 4\u00b0 higher annual average temperature and 40% higher precipitation in the Baltic basin would result in higher N levels in litter, lower decomposition and thus a considerable increase in humus accumulation.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "7785356a77264d031977278feaf3a52c3029cac0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2595212478", "CorpusId": 99617933}, "title": "Physical aspects of hydrogen adsorption in microporous materials", "abstract": "Physico-chem. adsorption of mols. in microporous materials has long been used in industrial processes and significant efforts have been expended in understanding the myriad of structure-property relationships of interest.

One area of current interest in CO2 utilization is the Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) from depleted reservoirs. In an Enhanced Oil Recovery system, a depleted or depleting oil reservoir is re-energized by injecting high-pressure CO2 to increase the recovery factor of the oil from the reservoir. An additional benefit beyond oil recovery is that the reservoir could also serve as a long-term storage vessel for the injected CO2. Although this technology is old, its application to depleted reservoirs is relatively recent because of its dual benefit of oil recovery and CO2 storage thereby making some contributions to the mitigation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions.

The largest potential reservoirs for storing carbon are the deep oceans and geological reservoirs in the earth's upper crust. This chapter focuses on geological sequestration because it appears to be the most promising large-scale approach for the 2050 timeframe. It does not discuss ocean or terrestrial sequestration. In order to achieve substantial GHG reductions, geological storage needs to be deployed at a large scale. For example, 1 Gt C/yr (3.6 Gt CO{sub 2}/yr) abatement, requires carbon capture and storage (CCS) from 600 large pulverized coal plants ({approx}1000 MW each) or 3600 injection projects at the scale of Statoil's Sleipner project. At present, global carbon emissions from coal approximate 2.5 Gt C. However, given reasonable economic and demand growth projections in a business-as-usual context, global coal emissions could account for 9 Gt C. These volumes highlight the need to develop rapidly an understanding of typical crustal response to such large projects, and the magnitude of the effort prompts certain concerns regarding implementation, efficiency, and risk of the enterprise. The key questions of subsurface engineering and surface safety associated with carbon sequestrationmore\u00a0\u00bb are: (1) Subsurface issues: (a) Is there enough capacity to store CO{sub 2} where needed? (b) Do we understand storage mechanisms well enough? (c) Could we establish a process to certify injection sites with our current level of understanding? (d) Once injected, can we monitor and verify the movement of subsurface CO{sub 2}? (2) Near surface issues: (a) How might the siting of new coal plants be influenced by the distribution of storage sites? (b) What is the probability of CO{sub 2} escaping from injection sites? What are the attendant risks? Can we detect leakage if it occurs? (3) Will surface leakage negate or reduce the benefits of CCS? Importantly, there do not appear to be unresolvable open technical issues underlying these questions. Of equal importance, the hurdles to answering these technical questions well appear manageable and surmountable. As such, it appears that geological carbon sequestration is likely to be safe, effective, and competitive with many other options on an economic basis.

Within the many options and actions for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, CO2 capture and storage is emerging as a viable option to achieve the very deep cuts in emissions that might be needed in the medium term. One promising means of CO2 capture for fossil fuels based power plants is to use a lime carbonation\u2013calcination cycle. The aim of the current work is to enhance the carbonation process by applying jetting fountain fluidized bed. A jetting fountain fluidized bed reactor has been designed, fabricated and installed to carry out the experimental work. It has 105 mm ID and 4000 mm height. Jabal al-Tair limestone has been utilized as bed materials. During the tests a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, that simulates exhaust gases (15% CO2), is fed through a bed of lime particles. The lime particles are carbonated by capturing CO2. The concentration of CO2 is measured after the bed to estimate the quantities of CO2 that combined with the lime particles. The influences of operating conditions including bed temperature, fluidization velocity, jet air ratio and jet orifice height on the capture efficiency of CO2 have been studied. The findings of the present work indicate that the jetting fountain fluidized bed is more efficient in carbonation where the CaO conversion rate increases and the time required for full conversion reduces. Applying jetting fountain configuration enhances gas solids contact and improves the interphases mass exchange between bubbles and emulsion. The capture efficiency of CO2 rate was found to improve with bed temperature and fluidization velocity.

The short alpine growing season forces rapid completion of plant growth cycles, which in turn causes competition between vegetative and reproductive growth sinks during the early part of the growing season. Mobilization of stored nitrogen and carbon reserves facilitates competing sinks and permits successful completion of reproduction before the onset of winter stress. We discuss the theoretical framework for assessing the costs and benefits of nutrient storage in alpine plants in order to lay the foundation for interpretation of observations. A principal point that has emerged from past theoretical treatments is the distinction between reserve storage, defined as storage that occurs with a cost to growth, and resource accumulation, defined as storage that occurs when resource supply exceeds demand, and thus when there is no cost to growth. We then discuss two case studies, one already published and one not yet published, pertaining to the storage and utilization of nitrogen and carbon compounds in alpine plants from Niwot Ridge, Colorado. In the first case, we tested the hypothesis that the seasonal accumulation of amino acids in the rhizome of N-fertilized plants of Bistorta bistortoides provides an advantage to the plant by not imposing a cost to growth at the time of accumulation, but providing a benefit to growth when the accumulated N is remobilized. We show that, as predicted, there is no cost during N accumulation but, not as predicted, there is no benefit to future growth. In the presence of N accumulation, reliance on stored N for growth increases, but reliance on current-season, soil-derived N decreases; thus the utilization of available N in this species is a 'zero sum' process. Inherent meristematic constraints to growth cause negative feedback that limits the utilization of accumulated N and precludes long-term advantages to this form of storage. In the second case study, we discuss new results showing high concentrations of cyclic polyol (cyclitol) compounds in the leaves of many alpine species dominant in the dry fellfield habitat. In Artemisia scopulorum, cyclitols were induced as the growing season progressed, and reached highest concentrations during the dry, late-summer months. Leaf cyclitol concentrations were high in all four species of the Caryophyllaceae that we examined and appeared to be constitutive components of the leaf carbohydrate pool as concentrations were high through the entire growing season. We observed correlations among seedling abundance, seeding survivorship and the presence of high leaf cyclitol concentrations. We propose that the primary function of cyclitols in the leaves of alpine, fellfield herbs is to promote drought tolerance through osmotic protection, and enhance fitness by improving seedling survival. We considered the possibility that cyclitols also function as carbon storage compounds that are remobilized at the end of the growing season and used to support growth the following year. Our observations do not support this hypothesis in the Caryophyllaceae because the requirement for high constitutive concentrations year-after-year prevents long-term advantages of storage and remobilization. However, in A. scopulorum, remobilization of cyclitols following the end of the growing season may provide storage substrates that can be used for growth the following season. From our analysis we conclude that it is difficult to use current theory that is embedded in the economic concept of costs and benefits to interpret observed dynamics in nitrogen and carbon allocation. Future theoretical developments that move away from an abstract foundation embedded in cost-benefit tradeoffs and toward phenotypic integration of source-sink relationships will improve our ability to merge observations and theory.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "871eda750f5fdc2ab24f304c4105df475bc641c0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2883289994", "CorpusId": 133661328}, "title": "Petrological characterization of the Cambrian sandstone reservoirs in the Baltic Basin, Sweden", "abstract": "The Cambrian sandstone reservoirs of the Baltic Basin have been identified by the Geological Survey of Sweden (SGU) as potential CO2 storage sites in line with regulations regarding Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). In order to understand the petrological and petrophysical characteristics of the sandstone units, 54 thin sections from the three main Cambrian sandstone units were studied. The description of the thin sections involved the use of scanning electron microscopy, backscatter electron and cathodeluminescence. The sandstone units are the Faludden, Nar and Viklau sandstones. The Faludden sandstone forms part of the Borgholm Formation whereas the Viklau and Nar form the File Haidar Formation. In addition to thin sections, core samples were also studied and this data was synthesized with petrophyisical data available at the SGU-archive in Lund. Of the 54 thin sections, 19 from the Faludden sandstone unit were sent to the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) for measurement of porosity and permeability, to add to the data already available at the SGU archive in Lund. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive petrological report on the variations of porosity, permeability, mineralogy, texture and cementation with depth. The results show that it is difficult to establish trends with depth in the study area because it is located in the basin peripheries at relatively shallow depth. However, the results showed that calcite and authigenic quartz are significant cement material which may reduce or obliterate porosity. The authigenic quartz is partly euhedral towards the empty pore space, partly filling the pore space and sometimes completely around the detrital quartz grain. The carbonate cements exhibit poikolotopic texture and where it occurs, the detrital grains show a low grain packing density. The results of the modal analyses showed that the Faludden sandstone, the youngest of the reservoirs, has the highest average porosities of 17% and the Viklau and Nar sandstones have 6.7 and 11.4% respectively. The deeper lying Viklau sandstone unit is made up of coarse grained sandstone which is not homogenous.

It is a very important step to achieve the soil water budget and for deriving drought awareness indices. It is also a basis for calculating soil-atmosphere Carbon flux. Hence, models of evapotranspiration, as part of land surface models, are assumed as key parts of hydrological and atmospheric general circulation models (Johnson et al., 1993). Under particular climate (represented by energy limiting evapotranspiration rate corresponding to potential evapotranspiration) and soil vegetation complex, evapotranspiration is controlled by soil moisture dynamics. Although radiative balance approaches are worth noting for evapotranspiration evaluation, according to Hofius (2008), the soil water balance seems the best method for determining evapotranspiration from land over limited periods of time. This chapter aims to discuss methods of computing and updating evapotranspiration rates using soil water balance representations. At large scale, Budyko (1974) proposed calculating annual evapotranspiration from data of meteorological stations using one single parameter w0 representing a critical soil water storage. Using a statistical description of the sequences of wet and dry days, Eagleson (1978 a) developed an average annual water balance equation in terms of 23 variables including soil, climate and vegetation parameters with the assumption of a homogeneous soilatmosphere column using Richards (1931) equation. On the other hand, the daily bucket with bottom hole model (BBH) proposed by Kobayashi et al. (2001) was introduced based on Manabe model (1969) involving one single layer bucket but including gravity drainage (leakage) as well as capillary rise. Vrugt et al. (2004) concluded that the daily Bucket model and the 3-D model (MODHMS) based on Richards equation have similar results. Also, Kalma & Boulet (1998) compared simulation results of the rainfall runoff hydrological model VIC which assumes a bucket representation including spatial variability of soil parameters to the one dimensional physically based model SiSPAT (Braud et al. , 1995). Using soil moisture profile data for calibration, they conclude that catchment\u2019s scale wetness index for very dry and very wet periods are misrepresented by SiSPAT while captured by VIC. Analyzing VIC parameter identifiability using streamflow data, DeMaria et al. (2007) concluded that soil parameters sensitivity was more strongly dictated by climatic gradients than by changes in soil properties especially for dry environments. Also, studying the measurements of soil moisture of sandy soils under semi-arid conditions, Ceballos et al. (2002) outlined the dependence of soil moisture time series on intra annual rainfall", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a8fffac04ef61c452f8d1dd758124ebc555f24ca", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2535741131", "DOI": "10.25560/14637", "CorpusId": 132174903}, "title": "Near-well effects in carbon dioxide storage in saline aquifers", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage, that is the collection of carbon dioxide (CO2) from power plants and its injection underground, is an important technology for reducing CO2 emissions to the atmosphere and hence, mitigating climate change. A key aspect of CO2 storage is the injection rate into the subsurface, which is limited by the pressure at which formation starts to fracture. Hence, it is vital to assess all of the relevant processes that may contribute to the pressure increase in the aquifer during CO2 injection. The central aim of this study is to analyse the ability of the near-well region of a saline formation to conduct fluids, using a set of analytical solutions that enable quick and reliable assessment of CO2 injectivity. In this research, the near-well fluid flow was assumed to be a function of the non-Darcy flow parameter as defined by the Forchheimer equation. For the analysis of single-phase flow problems, the analytical solution for the Forchheimer flow in closed domains was derived and an alternative method for applying analytical solutions associated with a single well to multiple well systems was proposed. The CO2 injection process was modelled as a two-phase system where the non-Darcy flow was assumed for the gas phase only, including a novel representation of the spatially varying fractional flow function. The solution for immiscible flow was further developed to model compositional displacements, which enabled analysis of the porosity reduction due to salt precipitation in a near-well region. Finally, the effects of gas compressibility were examined by integrating the analytical model with an iterative algorithm for correcting gas properties. Results showed that in low permeability formations when CO2 is injected at high rates non-Darcy flow conditions are more favourable for CO2 storage than linear flow due to better displacement efficiency. This, however, came at the cost of increased well pressures. More favourable estimations of the pressure buildup were obtained when CO2 compressibility was taken into account because reservoir pressures were reduced due to the change in the gas phase properties. The non-Darcy flow resulted in a significant reduction in solid salt saturation values, with a positive effect on CO2 injectivity. In the examples shown, non-Darcy flow conditions may lead to significantly different pressure and saturation distributions in the near-well region, with potentially important implications for CO2 injectivity.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "90e3888fa42c4776cc050894c15b967aeefad4e5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3171463307", "DOI": "10.2139/SSRN.3812382", "CorpusId": 236724666}, "title": "Corrosion of carbon steel in simulated CCS streams", "abstract": "It is expected that Carbon capture and storage (CCS) may involve a large network with many sources, transportation systems and storage sites.

It is well known that some impurities may react and produce species that are corrosive to carbon steel. Long transport pipelines will be made of carbon steel due to cost considerations, and it is therefore essential to avoid formation of corrosive species. \n \nIn the present work, corrosion of carbon steel was tested in a CO2 stream containing low levels of water and the impurities H2S, SO2, NO2 and O2 at a temperature of 25 \u00b0C and a pressure of 99 bar. The experiment was carried out in a custom-made autoclave with transparent windows that allowed for in-situ observation of any chemical reactions or corrosion processes. Each impurity, including water, was pre-mixed with CO2 at a high concentration (impurity stock solutions) and continuously injected through individual feed lines into the autoclave. This ensured that all impurities were injected fully dissolved in the CO2 phase and that no reactions could take place before the impurities were mixed inside the autoclave. The impurity injection rate was adjusted relative to the to the total CO2 rate, to get the desired impurity concentration in the autoclave. Exhaust CO2 was continuously removed from the autoclave and analysed for impurity content by laser spectroscopy.

INTRODUCTION The U.S. EPA Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) requires coal-fi red boilers to emit mercury at less than 1.2 lb/TBtu (1.5 ug/Nm3 at 6% O2). Figure 1 shows the mechanism for capturing mercury in a coal-fi red boiler. Elemental mercury is oxidized through gas phase reactions with halogens (Cl, Br) that originate in the coal or from coal additives, and are captured by surface reactions on the fl y ash. Sub-bituminous Power River Basin (PRB) coal has low concentrations of halogens and burns with less unburned carbon in the fl y ash than bituminous coal. Therefore, it is more challenging to remove mercury in PRB than in bituminous coal-fi red power plants. To enhance removal of Hg in a PRB coal fi red power plant, a mercury removal reagent such as a halogen solution is added to the coal and/or Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC) is injected into the fl ue gas to capture mercury in particulate removal devices such as an electrostatic precipitator or fabric fi lter [2].

In this context, the signatory countries were invited to indicate measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in order to transform traditional production matrices into a low carbon economic model. In the mining sector, the great variety of products generated by this industry results in the generation of three significant GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane gas (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O).

For the best treatment of the problem, the research was carried out in scientific, national and international productions and the collection of relevant legislation. According to the study, among the existing methodologies for the reduction of GHG emissions, Carbon Capture and Geological Storage (CGGS) stands out. The Intergovernmental Painel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines the capture and storage of CO2 in geological reservoirs as a process of separating CO2, transporting CO2 and storing it in geological reservoirs in the long term, the atmosphere. Another existing methodology includes the capture and destruction of methane from abandoned coal mines. This methodology quantifies the emission reductions generated by methane capture and destruction of abandoned / decommissioned coal mines. The capture and destruction of methane prevents greenhouse gases from being emitted into the atmosphere when a coal mine is abandoned. Methane pre-draining of an open active mine as a methane emission reduction activity, which quantifies greenhouse gas emission reductions, is considered appropriate to provide an approach to determine the amount of Methane that would be released without the project. Despite the environmental gains and the great potential to be explored regarding GHG mitigation through CCS technology, its application in Brazil is still restricted. The main obstacles to CCS projects are the lack of public acceptance, the cost of technology, scientific uncertainty, lack of political and financial incentives, lack of legislation and regulatory frameworks, and long-term civil liability. Also, it was verified in this study that there are few incentives in Brazil's climate policies and there are several related laws and analogous situations for CCS projects. To this end, government involvement must be increased, above all by the fiscal incentive and the dissemination of information among regulatory bodies, to the point of winning the engagement of civil society in the support of the CCS.

They provide important ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and storage. Drainage disturbs peatland ecosystem services. Mapping drains is difficult and expensive and their spatial extent is, in many cases, unknown. An object based image analysis (OBIA) was performed on a very high resolution satellite image (Geoeye-1) to extract information about drain location and extent on a blanket peatland in Ireland. Two accuracy assessment methods: Error matrix and the completeness, correctness and quality (CCQ) were used to assess the extracted data across the peatland and at several sub sites. The cost of the OBIA method was compared with manual digitisation and field survey. The drain maps were also used to assess the costs relating to blocking drains vs. a business-as-usual scenario and estimating the impact of each on carbon fluxes at the study site. Results The OBIA method performed well at almost all sites. Almost 500 km of drains were detected within the peatland. In the error matrix method, overall accuracy (OA) of detecting the drains was 94% and the kappa statistic was 0.66. The OA for all sub-areas, except one, was 95\u201397%. The CCQ was 85%, 85% and 71% respectively. The OBIA method was the most cost effective way to map peatland drains and was at least 55% cheaper than either field survey or manual digitisation, respectively. The extracted drain maps were used constrain the study area CO2 flux which was 19% smaller than the prescribed Peatland Code value for drained peatlands. Conclusions The OBIA method used in this study showed that it is possible to accurately extract maps of fine scale peatland drains over large areas in a cost effective manner. The development of methods to map the spatial extent of drains is important as they play a critical role in peatland carbon dynamics. The objective of this study was to extract data on the spatial extent of drains on a blanket bog in the west of Ireland. The results show that information on drain extent and location can be extracted from high resolution imagery and mapped with a high degree of accuracy. Under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol Annex 1 parties can account for greenhouse gas emission by sources and removals by sinks resulting from \u201cwetlands drainage and rewetting\u201d. The ability to map the spatial extent, density and location of peatlands drains means that Annex 1 parties can develop strategies for drain blocking to aid reduction of CO2 emissions, DOC runoff and water discoloration. This paper highlights some uncertainty around using one-size-fits-all emission factors for GHG in drained peatlands and re-wetting scenarios.

However, potential CO2 or CO2/SO2 seepage during some of the phases of a CCS project not only reduces its performing efficiency, but also impacts the local environment, which could have further impacts on human health. It is therefore essential to assess the potential risks and provide evidence that the impacts are well understood. Moreover, studying the effects of CO2 leakage is useful for identifying monitoring parameters if the leakage does happen, leading to the development of new approaches in detecting CO2 leaks. Accordingly, this research is carried out to assess the relevant impacts on the local environment of CO2 leakage, focusing on the environmental impacts caused by CO2 seepage associated with various soil types, mostly on the soil geochemical changes, which is currently lacked.\n\nAs a cost effective approach, this research was carried out with two types of well controlled laboratory experiments: Stage I- Closed reactor experiments and Stage II- A flow through column system (designed by the author). As a supplementary study to the research of the ASGARD site, Stage I experiments were carried out with soil samples collected from the ASGARD site and gave directions for Stage II column system design. Stage II experiments were carried out with two contrasting mono-mineral sediments considering sensitivity to CO2 gas, Trucal 5 and Trucal 6 (limestone sand of different particle size) and silica sand.\n\nCertain limitations of this research have to be considered. Firstly, highly idealised samples were used in the experiments instead of true soils and there was no heterogeneity in the samples used, which is not representative of the full complexity of a natural system. Secondly, the scale limitation of the laboratory work would lead to a higher gas/mineral ratio compared with field conditions. Therefore, results from the laboratory work cannot simply represent all the soils in the field, except the specific soil related problem and the results are better to be used to demonstrate the conditions where the soils/sediments are surrounded by high levels of CO2, such as the ones nearby a leaking injection well or along a fracture/fault. Nevertheless, this study is believed to provide a step towards understanding the potential impacts of CO2 seepage in soil, and potentially to be useful as a mean of identifying indicators of related problems when applying to the full-scale design, leading to the development of new approaches in detecting CO2 leaks.\n\nThroughout the experiments, the experimental apparatus (the continuous column system) newly designed by the author was run successfully, providing an alternative way in respect to the majority of soil-column studies for assessing issues of CO2 seepage. The main impact of CO2 emissions on soil properties is to drop the pH which triggers metals mobilisation from soils (all within safety limits to plant growth). The change of pH associated with both limestone and silica sand indicates that pH is an excellent parameter to indicate the CO2 intrusion into sediments once the background is set. The response of calcium (Ca) to CO2 flux highlights that carbonate minerals are sensitive to CO2 increase and could possibly be used as a parameter to monitor CO2 leakage once the baseline for the pre-injection concentration is set.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "92ca4ba6fcec7318f0373c33a4be4c26c78e65f6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3136941370", "DOI": "10.21203/RS.3.RS-223443/V1", "CorpusId": 233646887}, "title": "Model for Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment of Coal Based Electricity Generation in India", "abstract": "\n Purpose: This study evaluates the environmental efficiency of coal-based electricity generation in India.

Mass spectrometry with electron capture negative lonisation is a very sensitive detection technique for toxaphene congeners, but attention should be paid to variations in response. Fish consumption is supposed to be the main source of toxaphene exposure for man. Therefore, there is a need for more information on concentrations of toxaphene congeners in fish and shellfish, together with more information on the toxicological meaning of such data. Introduction The insecticide toxaphene is a complex mixture primarily consisting of chlorinated bornanes (CHBs) with an average elemental composition of C|o H|o Cl)j''\\ Prior to its ban in 1982 by the US Environmental Protection Agency\", toxaphene was the most extensively used pesticide in the USA and many other parts of the worid. The cumulative global production of toxaphene is estimated to be 1.3 megatons'\", which is higher than that of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Considerable amounts may still be placed in storage, although exact data are difficult to obtain\". Toxaphene has been detected as a contaminant in various environmental compartments and has a widespread distribution*^\"\". It is highly mutagenic'\". Some studies have indicated that toxaphene is also potentially carcinogenic'-'''. Due to aerial transport toxaphene concentrations were detected even in very remote areas'-*'\". Condensation at low temperatures is supposed to result in elevated concentrations in polar regions'\". It is supposed that toxaphene concentrations in North-East Atlantic fish are also due to this cold condensation process taking place after aerial transport of toxaphene from more southem and westem latitudes in Central and North-America*\". Different chlorine substitution can theoretically lead to 32,768 possible congeners\"', of which a number also shows chiral activity'\". This large number of congeners will, however, by far not be found, neither in the technical mixture, nor in environmental samples. Technical toxaphene, also known as strobane, phenatox or toxin 63, mainly consists of CI7 and Clg congeners and can therefore contain not more than 6,840 congeners. However, a number of these CHBs is unlikely to be present because of unfavourable substitution positions on ring and bridge carbon atoms'\". Jansson and Wideqvist have separated 670 different CHBs from a technical toxaphene mixture-\"\". In environmental samples the total number of CHBs will be smaller due to degradation in thc environment (weathering effects) and biotransformation, but nevertheless the remaining toxaphene pattems are still complex and require highly sophisticated techniques for their analysis. Nomenclature Toxaphene mixtures consist of polychlorinated bornanes (ca. 75 %), bornenes, bomadienes, chlorinated camphenes, dihydrocamphenes, other chlorinated hydrocarbons, and non-chlorinated hydrocarbons-\". At a Workshop on Toxaphene, held at Burlington, Ontario, Canada. 1993, it was agreed that for the time being and to avoid the use of many different names for the same subject the term chlorobomanes (CHBs) would be used for toxaphene compounds^^i xhis term is also used in this paper.

From retrofits to new vehicle designs, the freedom to add batteries, range extenders, or simply preserve cargo and passenger space is a major competitive advantage for all styles of in-wheel motor over more conventional electrical machines. This advantage needs to be preserved by not having to re-locate the friction brake to a position on the sprung mass of the vehicle, so both motors and brakes must be accommodated inside the wheels of a vehicle. To preserve as much of the retrofit market as possible, it must be ensured that the packaging solution inside the wheel does not require significant platform tear-up. In addition, the whole system must be safe, reliable, and provide credible vehicle performance. This has led to some radically different in-wheel motor concepts being developed by various organisations around the world. Protean's unique solution to this packaging problem was, on the face of it, a bold one for a start-up company; displace the brake to provide space for a motor, and develop a new packaging philosophy for the unsprung assembly incorporating both brake and motor. By working with an expert partner on the braking side, this, we believe, results in a much more harmonious use of the valuable space inside the wheel than other in-wheel solutions, and meets or exceeds all the requirements outlined above. This presentation will provide details of the process that resulted in the Protean design, as well as highlight the engineering of the solution fitted to the front axle of the high performance Protean/Brabus E-Class vehicle. Figure 1: Unsprung assembly, Protean/Brabus E-class front-left corner. TARGET MARKETS AND REQUIREMENTS OVERVIEW Protean Electric is targeting both passenger vehicles and light commercials with a blank sheet electric motor design wholly dedicated to in-wheel applications. Principally, the motor must be capable of being the sole source of tractive power for an electric vehicle or series hybrid, but must also work alongside conventional internal combustion powertrains to enable parallel hybrid architectures. To keep costs down, 2WD is an absolute must on smaller vehicles and hybrids, and 4WD should lend credible performance to larger, heavier executive saloons and SUVs. The performance of these vehicles should be able to squarely address the market segment the vehicle is in with the performance, range and interior space that a demanding customer requires. A key requirement that drives the Protean motor design is retro-fit ability. Clearly an in-wheel motor equipped powertrain opens up so many possibilities for sprung mass packaging and design changes that any vehicles that are designed from the ground-up around in-wheel motors will have their own protracted development cycles measured on the scale of several years. Balanced against this, OEMs need to remove significant amounts of carbon emissions from their entire fleet right now, and a handful of compromised niche vehicles will not achieve this. The ability to engineer a hybrid or full EV on an existing platform, with minimal tear-up of existing hardware or intrusion into passenger, storage or accident-vulnerable space cannot be underestimated and is one of the main advantages of choosing an in-wheel motor to propel a vehicle. It is therefore highly desirable for an in-wheel motor to be able to be fitted to a car without requiring any special wheel design or requiring risky suspension modifications, and this played a large part in the development of the requirements for the Protean motor. Regardless of the general architecture and form of an in-wheel motor, the unsprung environment is a harsh one compared with the on-body requirements for a motor. The wading requirements of the vehicle mean that the motor needs to operate whilst essentially submerged, and the wheelhouse is subject to great extremes of temperature thanks to the friction brake and rejected heat from any on-body ICE powertrain. For a road vehicle the motor must survive repeated shock loads of up to 50g with continuous vibration spectra of up to 20g RMS for severe rough roads. Stones are expected to impact any exposed face of the device and the cabling to the motor must be able to survive repeated bending and articulation with suspension and steering movement at temperatures well below zero.[1] The main challenge however will always be package space, especially with a retro-fittable design. In appreciating this, it is clear that Nm/litre and kW/litre have to be maximised. It is already well known that the best motor technology for volume specific performance is liquid-cooled brushless permanent magnet, and so early-on in the programme the decision was made to focus on this technology for the first high volume production motor that Protean is developing. TORQUE AND POWER REQUIREMENTS The principal purpose of the drivetrain is to deliver tractive motoring effort to the tyre-road interface. As a free bonus, an electric drivetrain has the potential to apply similar tractive effort in the braking domain and hand a sizeable chunk of the vehicle\u2019s kinetic energy back into the battery. Safety and/or regulatory concerns aside, on first consideration it is tempting to believe that friction brakes can be replaced entirely with the electric drivetrain but a few simple calculations show the cost of such a move. Take for example a relatively light 2WD passenger vehicle at 1500kg. Assuming a certain few key parameters it is quickly shown that the torque and power requirements are much greater in the braking domain than they are in motoring for a given wheel: \uf0b7 Torque o Motoring Pull-away torque for 30% grade = 650Nm (per motor) o Motoring Maintaining 100mph at 6% grade =300Nm (per motor) o Braking 1g braking = 1800Nm (per front wheel) \uf0b7 Power o Motoring Maintaining 100mph at 6% grade = 40kW (per motor) o Braking Deceleration at a rate of 1g at 100mph = 250kW (per front wheel) Fundamentally this is because the vehicle is always required to be able to perform an emergency stop from all speeds during normal operation, but forward tractive forces do not need to be anywhere near as large as braking forces in order to provide credible or even sporty forward vehicle performance. A universal truth of passenger vehicles is that the most powerful actuator on the vehicle is not the power-train, it is the brake system. It is important to note that the majority of this braking effort is carried out by the front wheels. In targeting 4WD applications, and not discerning (at the requirements level) between RWD or FWD in the case of a 2WD drivetrain, Protean clearly has to cater for, or not prevent, the provision of these levels of braking power and torque in its motor design If the motor were designed to be able to create the levels of retarding torque required in braking, it is shown by the example above that the motor would need to produce around three to four times more wheel torque and over five times more wheel power than if it were sized for even sporty forward performance. By inspecting Figure 2 below it can also be seen that, further to the above design difficulties, an emergency stop is very rarely conducted and so motors which are sized for full braking performance are very rarely of any use, and reclaim practically no extra regenerative energy than a drivetrain sized to regenerate up to 0.3g. The information displayed in Figure 2 was collated during initial developments on braking systems in conjunction with Alcon Components Ltd. Clearly, sizing the motor to meet emergency braking requirements will result in large implications for the cost, size and mass of the motor that are of little use. Figure 2: Brake utilisation curve for 2 million brake applications There are also some other show-stopping constraints \u2013 you need somewhere to put this energy you are generating with your motors. This will require either a much higher performance battery or other energy storage/dissipation devices which will add to the cost of the vehicle. Managing the failure modes of such a high performance motor will require some very restrictive safety requirements to be applied at both motor and vehicle levels, further increasing cost. The conclusion to this section is that Protean believes in-wheel motor driven cars still need friction brakes and one of the major requirements on our motor is that it is sized for forward performance only, and a friction brake is used to \u201ctop up\u201d the braking torque when under rare demanding braking circumstances, or when the battery has restricted charge current. By making the vehicle perform adequately in the motoring domain, almost all of the available regenerative energy is captured over the majority of real-world drive cycles anyway, especially on front-drive applications where higher regenerative brake torque can be applied without stability concerns. There is optimism within Protean Electric that the present motor design will enable the safe removal of friction brakes from the rear axle in future applications, but this is not currently permissible under present road vehicle legislation. So this leaves us to set torque and power requirements based on forward performance. When deriving torque requirements it is tempting to base the motor requirements from existing ICE-driven vehicles.

This study performs a tutorial review, in which practical guidance is given on the implementation of Techno-Economic Assessments (TEAs) for chemical CCU technologies. The tutorial review maps the differences in the methods and assumptions of economic feasibility studies for CCU technologies and advises how these studies can be improved in the future. A TEA framework, drafted by the CCU research community, is used as a benchmark in this review, to allow for objective comparisons between various economic feasibility studies. The four phases of an exhaustive TEA are (I) goal and scope, (II) data inventory, (III) calculation of indicators and (IV) interpretation. The tutorial review reveals that economic feasibility studies for chemical CCU technologies can and should be improved in various manners. Phases I and II are often skipped or incomplete. In Phase III, a very diverse indicator set is observed, which hampers comparability across CCU technologies. Phase IV, the interpretation of results, is often missing in the literature set or lacks thorough uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. The comparison with the TEA framework revealed the diversity in assumptions and methodological choices in the literature set. These findings suggest that future economic feasibility studies should be made in a more standardized way to improve both the quality and comparability of economic feasibility studies. Four improvements to the TEA framework are suggested: (i) focussing more on the impact of technical parameters in sensitivity analyses, (ii) adapting the assessment to the TRL of the technology, (iii) implementing ROA in the TEA and (iv) integrating an environmental assessment or LCA with the TEA.

Wellbore integrity needs to be maintained for leak-free storage and well cement plays a major role in wellbore integrity as it provides the necessary zonal isolation. To date, ordinary Portland cement (OPC)-based sealant has been used in injection wells and it has been found that it experiences cement degradation and is unstable under CO2-rich down-hole conditions. Therefore, current research has focused on geopolymer, an alkali-activated inorganic binder, as an alternative well sealant material to OPC. The main objective of the research is to study the flow and mechanical behaviour of geopolymers under CO2 sequestration conditions using experimental studies and numerical modelling techniques. Comparisons were made with the outcomes of traditional OPC-based well cement materials. Uniaxial compression and triaxial flow experiments were conducted as part of the experimental program and the COMSOL mulitiphysics numerical package was used to conduct numerical analysis. A series of uniaxial compressive strength tests were performed to study the mechanical behaviour of the wellbore materials geopolymer (G), formation rock sandstone (S) and G-S composite materials under different in-situ conditions. The mechanical behaviour of three different materials in water and brine with two different NaCl concentrations (5% and 15%) was experimentally studied. As expected, peak compressive strength of all three materials reduces in water and brine water, and lowest reduction rates were observed for geopolymer saturated in 15% NaCl brine. In addition, the strength reduction rates of geopolymer are less than that of traditional OPC-based well cement materials. The lowest reduction in compressive strength of geopolymer is due to the increased resistance to alkali leaching of geopolymer in brine water compared to water. The compressive strength of sandstone saturated in brine water does not vary significantly compared to that of water, and this is due to the higher quartz content and lower NaCl concentration in brine water. Previous researchers have also noticed that higher quartz content sandstone is not sensitive to microstructural changes in brine water. As a typical wellbore experiences a range of temperatures with injection depth, the mechanical behaviour of geopolymer and class G cement was studied at different curing temperatures (23-80 oC). The optimum curing temperature of both geopolymer and class G cement leading to higher mechanical strength is between 55-60 oC. Geopolymer shows higher compressive strength and Young\u2019s modulus values at elevated temperatures (> 36 oC), whereas G cement possesses higher values at lower curing temperatures (< 36 oC). The failure of geopolymer is shear at lower temperatures, while splitting failure is observed at elevated temperatures. On the other hand, class G cement fails in shear manner regardless of the curing temperature. Therefore, geopolymers can be employed at deeper depths of the well, where the temperature is higher, while G cement is suitable at shallow depths. A numerical study was performed to predict the mechanical behaviour of geopolymer at different temperatures. First, the model was calibrated with the experimental results and then a parametric study was performed to predict the mechanical behaviour under higher confining pressures. The structural mechanics module of COMSOL multiphysics was used, and a confining pressure range of 5-25 MPa was applied to geopolymer at different curing temperatures (23-80 oC). As the temperature is increased from 23-60 oC, the resulting failure strength increases by 205-320 % at different confining pressures (5-25 MPa), and a reduction of 9-10 % was observed from 60 oC to 80 oC. Increase in confinement and temperature increases the ductility and mechanical integrity of geopolymers due to plastic flow. When geopolymer is used as well cement in CCS wells, it is exposed to CO2 rich environment. Therefore, an experimental program was conducted to study the mechanical behaviour of geopolymer saturated in CO2. Based on the experimental findings, geopolymers show excellent mechanical integrity in CO2 as there was no sign of either strength reduction or cement degradation in geopolymer up to 6 months in CO2. In addition, geopolymer could not be fractured in hydraulic fracturing experiments, which employed different water injection pressures, confining pressure and tube lengths. Under any stress exposure conditions, the primary objective of well cement is to provide zonal isolation in the well. Since geopolymer could not be fractured under extreme stress exposures, it can provide good mechanical integrity and zonal isolation under severe loading conditions. Permeability tests were conducted with the high pressure triaxial rig available in the laboratory to investigate the permeability of wellbore materials under different in-situ stress conditions. A set of drained experiments was performed on geopolymer samples, and it was noticed that the apparent CO2 permeability of geopolymers (2\u00d710-21 m2 to 6\u00d710-20 m2) is lower than that of traditional American Petroleum Industry (API) class well cements (10-20 to 10-11 m2). In addition, increases in injection and confining pressures reduce the permeability of geopolymers. Another set of undrained flow experiments was conducted to study the sub- and super-critical CO2 permeability of wellbore materials (geopolymer (G), sandstone (S) and G-S composite). The permeability of sandstone and G-S composite materials is approximately thousands of times higher than that of geopolymer. Both the permeability and percentage permeability reduction (per 1 MPa increase in downstream pressure) reduce significantly from sub-critical to super-critical CO2 pressure conditions, implying the importance of super-critical CO2 phase conditions for effective and leak-free underground storage. An attempt was made to model the CO2 flow through geopolymer under laboratory triaxial stress conditions. The CO2 flow through geopolymer could be modelled using COMSOL multiphysics. The permeability values obtained from the model were consistent with the experimental outcomes. In addition, CO2 pressure and concentration distributions in geopolymer were also studied under various injection and confining pressures. The permeability of geopolymer depends on many factors, one being the mix composition of the geopolymer. Therefore, a series of undrained flow experiments was performed to study the effects of three different types of geopolymer on CO2 permeability, and existing class G cement was also tested for comparison purposes. Different types of geopolymers were made by adding 0, 8 and 15% of slag to fly ash (by mass). It was noted that the CO2 permeability values of geopolymers were approximately 100-1000 times lower than class G cement. In addition, the permeability of 15% slag added geopolymer was approximately 10 times lower than fly ash-based geopolymer, and this is explained by the reduction in pore diameter and increase in pore area of geopolymer with the addition of slag. Finally, the effect of temperature on the permeability of fly ash-based geopolymer was experimentally studied for a range of temperatures. The apparent CO2 permeability of geopolymer increases with increases in temperature from 23-70 oC, however the permeability values (0.0004-0.04 \u03bcD) are well below the API recommended limits of 200 \u03bcD. An empirical formulation was developed to predict the permeability of geopolymer at different temperatures under various injection and confining pressure conditions.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "0bc73c5831ad1c4df9993a7e2621b903d386ba0f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2164813367", "CorpusId": 110811867}, "title": "\uac00\uc2a4\ud130\ube48\uacfc \uc21c\uc0b0\uc18c \uc5f0\uc18c\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uc131\ub2a5\ud574\uc11d", "abstract": "Future power plants will be required to adopt some type of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to reduce their CO2 emissions.

We use uncertainty analysis of water quality model results to help define a sampling method for particulate organic carbon in disturbed watershed systems. Low-gradient watersheds with agriculture and urban land use disturbances receive a significant portion of organic matter from in-stream benthic carbon production in which coupled physical and biological processes govern the degree of organic carbon accrual. A lack of uniformity in methodological approaches and temporal domains has driven the need to develop an appropriate and repeatable sampling strategy to capture the range and distribution of transported organic carbon. Therefore for this study a conceptual model for sediment carbon fate and transport was applied to a lowland watershed system with pronounced fluvial storage and agriculturally and urban disturbed lands. A suite of sampling routines was implemented to test the sensitivity of the transported carbon (CT) distribution, aiming to isolate the importance of physical and biological processes. Results of the study highlight CT followed a Gamma distribution, with a root mean square error approximation of 0.066. Low flow sampling routines performed as well as routines including high and low flows, contradicting previous studies that emphasize capturing high flow events for CT variability. Likewise, monthly and bimonthly sampling routines were as adequate as a weekly or bimonthly routine.

In this paper, a novel model is proposed to predict the specific capacity of porous carbon LIB anodes. For this purpose, a new factor is introduced, which is called normalized surface area. Considering this factor, the contribution of surface lithium storage can be added to the lithium stored in the bulk to have a better prediction. The novel model proposed in this study is able to estimate the lithium storage capacity of LIB anodes based on the porosity of porous carbons for the first time. Benefiting porosity value (specific surface area) makes the predictions quick, facile, and sensible for the scientists and experts designing LIBs using porous carbon anodes.

Even the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has offered no scenario that would stabilize atmospheric levels. The capacity of the oceans to absorb CO2 is limited to about 40% of the level of emissions in 1990. Shared equitably among the present-day world population, per capita emissions of 35% of the current European average would only return the world to 100% of 1990 emission levels. Yet world population will probably grow by 25% by 2050 and, between 1990 and 2007, global emissions increased by 29%. Our current global trajectory is hurtling us toward ever-higher levels, perhaps even disaster. Consequently, near-zero-emitting sources are the only approaches to energy generation that should be deployed. Nuclear power, with its immense energy density, is the only available source that qualifies for widespread deployment. Existing alternative options are not and cannot effectively contribute (see e.g. MacKay, 2008). The weakness in wind is the need for back-up and supplementation, not so much from its short-term fickleness but its seasonal variability. Carbon capture and storage would have to achieve far higher levels of capture than currently seem feasible. Hydroelectricity has limited remaining potential as well as needing careful deployment to avoid collateral emissions. Aggressive conservation and efficiency measures reduce but do not solve the growth in energy demand and usage. Global economic downturns provide temporary relief but huge social political pain, and energy supply security concerns remain unresolved issue for many countries, even today. Of course nuclear alone would face an overwhelming challenge. We shall need to deploy massive improvements in the efficiency with which energy is used. Solar power in various forms has promise and could have a substantial role at lower latitudes in consistently sunny areas though photovoltaic electricity is still a high-cost option. Geothermal and various forms of ocean-derived energy have development potential. However, we argue that worldwide deployment of 5000 to 10 000 nuclear reactors by 2050 is the only clearly accessible pathway to CO2 stabilization that exists today. This will require extension of the resource beyond once-through cycles and so the deployment of advanced reactor types. But it is doable, it is affordable, and our planet must plan to accomplish this deployment.Copyright \u00a9 2009 by ASME", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "552f0016195467953516b0556092984fa87a2285", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2972238809", "DOI": "10.1016/j.enconman.2019.111994", "CorpusId": 202887169}, "title": "Energy assessment of coal-fired steam power plant, carbon capture, and carbon liquefaction process chain as a whole", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "b571498700e771f46e7a1f702b6bf8542736fa62", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2025457927", "CorpusId": 56290551}, "title": "Modeling geologic storage of carbon dioxide: Comparison ofnon-hysteretic chracteristic curves", "abstract": "TOUGH2 models of geologic storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) in brine-bearing formations use characteristic curves to represent the interactions of non-wetting-phase CO2 and wetting-phase brine. When a problem includes both injection of CO2 (a drainage process) and its subsequent post-injection evolution (a combination of drainage and wetting), hysteretic characteristic curves are required to correctly capture the behavior of the CO2 plume. In the hysteretic formulation, capillary pressure and relative permeability depend not only on the current grid-block saturation, but also on the history of the saturation in the grid block. For a problem that involves only drainage or only wetting, a nonhysteretic formulation, in which capillary pressure and relative permeability depend only on the current value of the grid-block saturation, is adequate. For the hysteretic formulation to be robust computationally, care must be taken to ensure the differentiability of the characteristic curves both within and beyond the turning-point saturations where transitions between branches of the curves occur. Two example problems involving geologic CO2 storage are simulated using non-hysteretic and hysteretic models, to illustrate the applicability and limitations of non-hysteretic methods: the first considers leakage of CO2 from the storage formation to the ground surface, while the second examines the role of heterogeneity within the storage formation.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "ece82ae755904cba0f7af7338d25481ed530a696", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2079819807", "DOI": "10.1021/LA0523816", "CorpusId": 13280752, "PubMed": "16460092"}, "title": "Optimum conditions for adsorptive storage.", "abstract": "The storage of gases in porous adsorbents, such as activated carbon and carbon nanotubes, is examined here thermodynamically from a systems viewpoint, considering the entire adsorption-desorption cycle. The results provide concrete objective criteria to guide the search for the \"Holy Grail\" adsorbent, for which the adsorptive delivery is maximized. It is shown that, for ambient temperature storage of hydrogen and delivery between 30 and 1.5 bar pressure, for the optimum adsorbent the adsorption enthalpy change is 15.1 kJ/mol. For carbons, for which the average enthalpy change is typically 5.8 kJ/mol, an optimum operating temperature of about 115 K is predicted. For methane, an optimum enthalpy change of 18.8 kJ/mol is found, with the optimum temperature for carbons being 254 K. It is also demonstrated that for maximum delivery of the gas the optimum adsorbent must be homogeneous, and that introduction of heterogeneity, such as by ball milling, irradiation, and other means, can only provide small increases in physisorption-related delivery for hydrogen. For methane, heterogeneity is always detrimental, at any value of average adsorption enthalpy change. These results are confirmed with the help of experimental data from the literature, as well as extensive Monte Carlo simulations conducted here using slit pore models of activated carbons as well as atomistic models of carbon nanotubes.

We make several suggestions on matters of detail in response to the consultation questions. Specifically, we suggest the establishment of a process of continual review of the realistic capacity of carbon dioxide storage reservoirs. We further suggest that, to allow for the rapid rate of generation of new scientific information, the following are needed. First, an explicit, quantitative statement of the timescale that government considers sufficient for a reservoir to store carbon dioxide securely. Second, an explicit, quantitative statement of the level of leakage risk that government considers acceptable. Third, the publication of plans to accelerate the release into the public domain of seismic, borehole log, well injection test, and drilling record data generated by the private sector. Fourth, an explicit statement of government\u2019s view on the extent to which bio-fuel power stations should be covered by regulations requiring carbon capture readiness. Finally, the production of a companion document establishing similar principles for the retrofit of carbon capture and storage systems at existing power stations. We also note the importance of potential CCS operators having robust plans for monitoring their storage reservoirs, using monitoring technologies that have been thoroughly demonstrated to be of sufficient accuracy and precision. In addition to these technical matters, we make several suggestions about the financial and regulatory aspects of the path to CCS deployment. First, we urge the early production by government of detailed criteria for deciding whether CCS is technically and economically proven. Second, we suggest the adoption of measures to counter any disincentives to private-sector funding of carbon capture and storage research. Third, we point out that the judgement as to whether CCS is technically and economically proven may need to be a continual and site-by-site process, starting as soon as reasonably practicable. Fourth, we propose that the starting date for the requirement to retrofit be left open (but certainly no later than 2025). This will allow for flexibility should CCS be technically and economically proven in advance of 2020.

Tenth, we urge extra care to be taken over the equity implications of co-location of demonstration projects.

An example of hydrogen release/capture of TiH2 will be shown in order to demonstrate the utility of simultaneous thermal analyses under high pressure/high temperature conditions (STA-HP; ATG-DTA) for such type of investigations.

High temperatures (>3000 K) are required to get a reasonable CO2 conversion, incurring a high energy cost.Recently, the combination of non-thermal plasma and catalysis provides an attractive alternative to the conventional catalytic route for the conversion of greenhouse gas into value-added fuels and chemicals because of its unique capability to induce both physical and chemical reactions at low temperatures 1, 2. In this study, a coaxial dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) reactor has been developed for plasma-catalytic conversion of CO2 into higher value chemicals (e.g., CO and methanol) at low temperatures. Combining DBD with BaTiO3 and TiO2 photocatalysts significantly enhances CO2 conversion and energy efficiency by up to 250%. The synergy of plasma-catalysis for CO2 conversion can be attributed to both the physical effect induced by the presence of catalysts in the plasma and photocatalytic surface reactions driven by the discharge.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "45f473dbe484e3a04f4634a743b28ba1bdda27fe", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2093647928", "DOI": "10.1007/s11104-010-0299-0", "CorpusId": 36006197}, "title": "Long-term fencing improved soil properties and soil organic carbon storage in an alpine swamp meadow of western China", "abstract": "Overgrazing significantly affects alpine meadows in ways similar to grasslands in other areas.

Saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs with good seals and located in tectonically stable zones make an excellent storage formation option for geological carbon sequestration. However, stored carbon dioxide (CO2) takes a long time to convert into diagenetically stable form. Hence, ensuring the CO2 does not leak from these reservoirs in this time period is the key to any successful CCS project. Numerous methods are developed over the past couple of decades to identify the leaks which utilizes various types of geophysical, geochemical and engineering data. We demonstrate the automated leakage detection in CCS projects using pressure data obtained from Cranfield reservoir, Mississippi, USA. Our dataset consists of CO2 injection rates and pressure monitoring data obtained from a pressure pulse test. We first demonstrate the differences between the pressure pulse signal in case of a baseline pulse test and a pulse test with an artificially induced leak onsite. We then use machine learning techniques to automatically differentiate between the two tests. The results indicate that even simple deep learning architectures such as multi-layer feedforward network (MFNN) can identify a leak using pressure data and can be used to raise an early warning flag.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "8f540bfa5ddb6b4ddde77789fefa06d69c7ea8c0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2181437449", "CorpusId": 130467860}, "title": "Impacts of Future US GHG Regulatory Policies on Large-Scale Coal to Liquids Plants", "abstract": "Mandatory US regulation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions could strongly impact the design and financial return of future US coal-to-liquids (CTL) projects due to the size of their carbon footprint. This paper presents the results of a Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored analysis examining the impact that future carbon prices could have on a nominal 50,000 barrel per day (BPD) Illinois CTL plant. The first phase of the paper presents the results of two CTL plant designs: one with and one without carbon sequestration. Basic information on the plant layouts, performance, cost, carbon emissions, financial results (without placing a value on CO2), and major sensitivities provides the basis for subsequent analysis. The second phase discusses the major CO2 regulatory policies being evaluated in the 110 Congress, and how these policies, by placing a value on CO2, could impact the financial performance of CTL plants. Two different methods are undertaken for estimating CO2 cost: a range of flat prices throughout the life of each project, and a ramp-up of CO2 price during the performance period, reflecting the potential for tighter emissions regulations in 2020 and beyond. These costs are entered into the base case financial models for each CTL plant design. The results show the expected return on investment for each project under a range of CO2 price scenarios, and what CO2 price(s) would be necessary to economically justify the sequestration of CO2. Preliminary results at a $0/ton value for CO2 show an ROI for the CTL plant without capture at 15.3% and an ROI of 12.0% once compression and sequestration is included. A flat CO2 price of $12.50/ton throughout the life of the plant would be required to justify the additional expenditure on the CTL plant with capture. In the alternate CO2 price scenario, a government target to stabilize CO2 concentrations at 550 ppm or lower would be necessary to provide a sufficient economic driver for CO2 capture from CTL plants. Of the 5 major CO2 reduction policies being considered in the US Senate as of April 2007, only one, Sanders-Boxer, would provide a clear price signal to support CTL plants with carbon capture and storage. This information is relevant to a complete understanding for how CO2 regulations could impact this emerging US industry.

One of the alternatives proposed is carbon capture and storage, where the carbon dioxide emitted from large point sources is captured, compressed and stored in underground storage sites. Many of the largest point sources of carbon dioxide are power plants fuelled by fossil fuels. There are several technologies for adapting the combustion process to capture carbon dioxide. Chemical-looping combustion is one such option and has the advantage of keeping the fuel and the combustion air apart, thus avoiding energy consuming carbon dioxide-nitrogen separation. This is achieved by transferring oxygen from the air to the fuel by a cyclic oxidation and reduction of a solid metal oxide. The oxygen-carrying material needs to meet a number of requirements in order to achieve an efficient combustion process. Manganese oxides have promising properties as oxygen-carrier material and these can be further improved by combining the manganese with for example iron, silica and calcium. Chemical-looping combustion is mainly developed as a technology for fluidised-bed combustion with the oxygen carrier present as the bed material in the form of small particles. To perform well in a circulating fluidised bed the oxygen carrier needs to be mechanically stable as well as have good reactivity with the fuel. During the development of manganese combined oxides, materials with such properties have been identified. The work presented in this thesis examines the performance of manganese combined oxides as oxygen carriers in interconnected fluidised beds with continuous circulation. The operation has been carried out in two reactor systems with gaseous fuels, in which the properties of the materials have been evaluated. It has been shown that full conversion of the fuel can be achieved during chemical-looping combustion in a 10 kWth reactor unit with a calcium manganite of perovskite structure as oxygen carrier. Furthermore, combined oxides of iron-manganese-silica and manganese-silica have been examined in a 300 Wth reactor unit. High fuel conversion was achieved with both combined oxides systems, but the mechanical stability of these materials was not satisfactory. It was found that the mechanical stability of combined oxides of manganese-silica could be improved by adding titania to the material.

Degassing of CO2 and radon isotopes (222Rn-220Rn) from soil, gas vents and thermal water discharges was investigated in the natural analog of Campo de Calatrava Volcanic Field (CCVF; Central Spain) to determine the CO2-Rn relationships and to assess the role of CO2 as carrier gas for radon. Furthermore, radon measurements to discriminate between shallow and deep gas sources were evaluated under the perspective of their applicability in monitoring programs of carbon storage projects. C02 flux as high as 5000 gm-2d-1 and 222Rn activities up to 430kBqm-3 were measured; 220Rn activities were one order of magnitude lower than those of 222Rn. The 222 Rnj220Rn ratios were used to constrain the source ofthe Campo de Calatrava soil gases since a positive correlation between radon isotopic ratios and CO2 fluxes was observed. Thus, in agreement with previous studies, our results indicate a deep mantle-related origin of CO2 for both free and soil gases, suggesting that carbon dioxide is an efficient carrier for Rn. Furthermore, it was ascertained that the increase of 222Rn in the soil gases was likely produced by two main processes: (i) direct transport by a carrier gas, Le., C02 and (ii) generation at shallow level due to the presence of relatively high concentrations of dissolved U and Ra in the thermal aquifer of Campo de Calatrava. The diffuse CO2 soil flux and radon isotopic surveys carried out in the Campo de Calatrava Volcanic Fields can also be applicable to geochemical monitoring programs in CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) areas as these parameters are useful to: (i) constrain C021eakages once detected and (ii) monitor both the evolution of the leakages and the effectiveness of subsequent remediation activities.

High fuel conversion was achieved with both combined oxides systems, but the mechanical stability of these materials was not satisfactory. It was found that the mechanical stability of combined oxides of manganese-silica could be improved by adding titania to the material. Future work would include further investigation regarding the effect of the material composition on the performance.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "48de34b3e89257a82e1cf3d42b05962fa40b4db6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2333479982", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.20149388", "CorpusId": 131760586}, "title": "Risk of Overfilling the Budziszewice-Zaosie Structure in the Course of CO2 Injection", "abstract": "The PGE Belchatow Power Plant is classified as the biggest carbon emitter in the EU. To reduce CO2 emissions the company plans to introduce the carbon capture and storage technology.Within the framework of the Polish National Program \u201cAssessment of formations and structures for safe CO2 geological storage, including monitoring plans\u201d, semi-detailed analysis of the Budziszewice\u2013Zaosie anticline was carried out. This anticline is considered optional for CO2 storage for Belchatow Power Plant. The most perspective reservoir is located in Lower Jurassic Drzewice Fm. Based on static 3D model, constructed by a team from the Polish Geological Institute and the Department of Fossil Fuels the authors made simulation of CO2 injection using Eclipse 2009. The cutoff contour was established at 700 m below sea level; injection below it could bring about penetration of gas up to the land surface toward the Holy Cross Mountains (SE Lower Jurassic outcrops) or through dislocations of the Justynow structure to NW or Jezow to the E. At the present state of recognition of the configuration and size of the structure, a safe, physically possible quantity of injected CO2 amounts to approximately 30 Mt. Presented results can be assumed as the most pessimistic scenario for the structure.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "f4178f52e12b7ee8422d31bd1e2c1d8126ad745c", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3390/cleantechnol4020014", "CorpusId": 247726068}, "title": "Understanding the Anomalous Corrosion Behaviour of 17% Chromium Martensitic Stainless Steel in Laboratory CCS-Environment\u2014A Descriptive Approach", "abstract": "To mitigate carbon dioxide emissions CO2 is compressed and sequestrated into deep geological layers (Carbon Capture and Storage CCS). The corrosion of injection pipe steels is induced when the metal is in contact with CO2 and at the same time the geological saline formation water. Stainless steels X35CrMo17 and X5CrNiCuNb16-4 with approximately 17% Cr show potential as injection pipes to engineer the Northern German Basin geological onshore CCS-site. Static laboratory experiments (T = 60 \u00b0C, p = 100 bar, 700\u20138000 h exposure time, aquifer water, CO2-flow rate of 9 L/h,) were conducted to evaluate corrosion kinetics. The anomalous surface corrosion phenomena were found to be independent of heat treatment prior to exposure. The corrosion process is described as a function of the atmosphere and diffusion process of ionic species to explain the precipitation mechanism and better estimate the reliability of these particular steels in a downhole CCS environment.", "year": 2022}]}
