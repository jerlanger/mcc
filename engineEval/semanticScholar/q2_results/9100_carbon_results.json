Here we focused on aboveground C storage rates and accumulation using a one-year increment analysis applied across different winegrape varietals and different-aged vineyard blocks. This produced a chronosequence of C storage rates over what is roughly the productive lifespan of most vines (aged 2\u201330\u00a0years). To our knowledge, this study provides the first estimate of C storage rates in the woody biomass of vines. Additionally, we assessed C storage in wildland buffers and adjacent oak-dominated habitats over a 9-year period. Results Carbon storage averaged 6.5\u00a0Mg/Ha in vines. We found the average annual increase in woody C storage was 43% by mass. Variation correlated most strongly with vine age, where the younger the vine, the greater the relative increase in annual C. Decreases in C increment rates with vine age were more than offset by the greater overall biomass of older vines, such that C on the landscape continued to increase over the life of the vines at 18.5% per year on average. Varietal did not significantly affect storage rates or total C stored. Carbon storage averaged 81.7\u00a0Mg/Ha in native perennial buffer vegetation; we found an 11% increase in mass over 9\u00a0years for oak woodlands and savannas. Conclusions Despite a decrease in the annual rate of C accumulation as vines age, we found a net increase in aboveground C in the woody biomass of vines. The results indicate the positive role that older vines play in on-farm (vineyard) C and overall aboveground accumulation rates. Additionally, we found that the conservation of native perennial vegetation as vineyard buffers and edge habitats contributes substantially to overall C stores.

Although capture of CO2 from large point sources is a practical option, most anthropogenic releases of CO2 come from smaller, more widely-distributed sources that do not lend themselves to current capture technologies. Investigating methodologies that can remove CO2 from the atmosphere may therefore play a crucial role in reducing overall anthropogenic CO2 build up. Under the terms of the Kyoto Protocol (now ratified by a majority of countries), signatories can meet part of their obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption by increasing land carbon sinks. However, there are serious concerns about the permanence of current carbon sinks (typically involving afforestation), and the accuracy with which carbon sequestration can be quantified and verified. A novel organogenic model for carbon sequestration in dolomite, based on natural systems and proven in laboratory experiments, is offered as a long-term option for large-scale carbon management. The model employs microbially-induced mineralisation with the potential for significant sequestration of atmospheric carbon and can satisfy the Kyoto criteria for permanence, quantification, verification and additionality. The technique uniquely provides a lowenergy technological solution for significantly reducing atmospheric CO2 levels by mineral sequestration. It can be located where land is unsuitable for agriculture, and requires low levels of capital investment and maintenance costs.

PSA technology utilizes carbon molecular sieve material and pressure to adsorb oxygen (O2) molecules while allowing N2 molecules to pass through the sieve material. The prototype PSA unit was tested at the NIOSH Safety Research Coal Mine (SRCM) where a 62,000 ft area of the mine was rendered inert during a series of two tests. The resultant data were then used to construct a CFD simulation of both injection tests. In addition, O2 depletion and gas leakage rates were quantified in the model and were compared to actual values. Once the model was calibrated, the sealed mine area was doubled and simulations were made with various injection rates and injection site locations to determine the impact on the time needed to render this area inert. This paper presents an overview of the PSA plant, the details of the gas injection tests and CFD modeling work. Disclaimer: The findings and conclusions in this report are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the views of NIOSH. Introduction The concept of monitoring, sampling, and maintaining an inert atmosphere in sealed mine areas is a relatively new practice for the US coal mining industry. Subsequent to the enactment of the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 (PL 109-236) also known as the MINER Act, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) issued mandatory health and safety standards relating to the sealing of abandoned areas in underground coal mines. On May 22, 2007, MSHA issued an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) addressing the strength, construction, maintenance, and repair of mine seals [1]. The ETS also included requirements for sampling and controlling the atmosphere behind seals. Because of the requirements of the ETS, mine operators had to seek technology to render and maintain a sealed mine area inert. On April 18, 2008, MSHA published a final rule that superseded the ETS. The final rule addressed seal strength design, construction, maintenance and repair of seals and monitoring and control of the atmosphere behind seals to reduce the risk of seal failure and the risk of explosions in abandoned areas of underground coal mines [2]. Under current US federal law (30 CFR \u00a775.336 except as provided in \u00a775.336(d)), the atmosphere in the sealed mine area is considered inert when the O2 concentration is less than 10% or the methane (CH4) concentration is less than 3% or greater than 20% [3]. When it is determined by sampling that the atmosphere in a sealed area is greater than 10% O2 or CH4 gas concentration is between 3% and 20%, the mine operator must, by law, take immediate action to restore an inert sealed atmosphere. Furthermore, when additional sampling indicates that the O2 concentration is 10% or greater and CH4 is between 4.5% and 17%, persons shall be withdrawn from the affected area which is the entire mine or other affected area identified by the operator and approved by the MSHA District Manager [4]. A sealed mine area can be rendered inert through the natural accumulation of CH4, over time, to levels beyond the explosive range, oxidation of the coal and possibly other materials (thereby removing O2 and releasing carbon dioxide (CO2) and the injection of N2 into the sealed mine areas to quickly reduce the O2 content to a level that will not support combustion. In the US, the available sources of N2 gas for use by mine operators includes liquid or gaseous N2 that is trucked to a mine site in tankers, on site cryogenic plants that separate the components of air through rectification, or technologies that separate and extract N2 gas from the atmosphere using hollow fiber membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA). Under a program created by the MINER Act, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) awarded a contract to On Site Gas Systems in Newington, Connecticut to design and construct an inmine N2 generation plant. The objective of this effort was to build a high volume, high purity PSA N2 generator that could operate in an underground mine. PSA technology was selected because these systems are 12.5% more efficient than the alternative membrane systems in terms of the ratio of feed air required to N2 gas produced. PSA systems operate over a broad range of incoming feed air temperatures without impacting the efficiency, thus external air heaters are not required. Electrical requirements for a PSA system are minimal and thus operating costs are less than a comparable membrane system. Also, the lifespan of a N2 generating system using PSA technology is indefinite with regular maintenance and avoidance of oil and water contamination. PSA technology uses a carbon molecular sieve material and pressure to adsorb O2 molecules while allowing N2 molecules to pass through the sieve material. A typical PSA unit has at least two adsorber beds filled with the carbon molecular sieve material. During each half cycle, one adsorber bed produces N2 while the other is purged of O2. Compressed air (feedstock gas) is used to pressurize the adsorber sieve beds and, during this process, the smaller O2 molecules of the feedstock gas are adsorbed by the sieve material while the larger N2 molecules float free (figure 1). Figure 1. Conceptual drawing of PSA Technology. Once an adsorber bed is saturated with O2, a bit of the gas pressure is released in the bed to draw off the N2 molecules. The N2 molecules are then collected in a surge/storage tank for use. A valve is then opened in the saturated adsorber bed which releases all of the pressure, forcing out the captured molecules of the unwanted gases, and cleanses the sieve for the next cycle (the molecules of the released gas immediately diffuse back into the atmosphere at essentially the ambient percentages). This cycle repeats continuously and with the use of multiple adsorber beds, working at opposing ends of the cycle, and a storage/surge tank, a consistent flow of N2 gas is achieved [5]. Under this effort, On Site Gas Systems conceived and designed a completely new concept in PSA sieve bed design which enabled a substantial decrease in sieve bed heights while still maintaining sufficient N2 gas production. The N2 generating system is capable of producing up to 300 scfm of N2 at 50 psig (figure 2). Currently, the electrical requirement for the N2 generating system is 110 Vac and approximately 10 A, but the unit could be reconfigured to operate on some other type of power supply. The feed air requirement is 600 scfm air at minimum 90 psig with a temperature between 32\u00b0 F and 100\u00b0F and a dew point of less than 40oF non-condensing. In order to facilitate transportation and movement within a mine, it was determined that the N2 generating system had to fit within the confines of a standard-sized shield car transport and also within height of typical entries of mines operating in the Pittsburgh Coalbed (about 6 ft). These constraints resulted in overall unit dimensions of 206 in (length) by 84 in (wide) by 44 in (height). A complete description of the development of the N2 generating system is available in [6]. Figure 2. Novel PSA N2 generating system. On Site Gas Systems also designed and built a skidmounted air dryer/filter that modifies the feed air for the PSA plant for circumstances in which feedstock air is unable to meet required input temperatures and dew point (figure 3). Figure 3. N2 generating system with air dryer. The air dryer/filter was also designed to meet dimensional constraints mentioned above and would be a separate, ancillary part of the N2 generating system. Currently, the air dryer/filter design calls for 240 V, 3phase power, but it could be reconfigured to operate on single-phase 110 Vac or some other available power supply.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "236aab4036d0b73830992ec101534131e11c1695", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2044819681", "DOI": "10.1007/S10661-007-9910-0", "CorpusId": 38669657, "PubMed": "17882526"}, "title": "Carbon storage and emissions offset potential in an African dry forest, the Arabuko-Sokoke Forest, Kenya", "abstract": "Concerns about rapid tropical deforestation, and its contribution to rising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, increase the importance of monitoring terrestrial carbon storage in changing landscapes.

Carbon capture and sequestration may allow Australian dependence upon coal and gas for electricity generation to continue to rise without consequential major increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. However NSW and Queensland are deficient in suitable geological structures, for CO2 sequestration, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs, close to the main sources of CO2 production, in particular power plants.

Based on the detected bottleneck points 3 main areas are investigated for the development of microalgae based biorefineries to improve its efficiencies: (1) carbon capture from flue gas to provide CO2 for the cultivation of algae, (2) cultivation of microalgae biomass and (3) the elimination of drying process or the application of hydrothermal conversion technologies. The carbon capture related bottleneck is evaluated conducting life cycle, PESTLE and Multi-Criteria Decision analyses. It is found that the environmental effects of Carbon Capture and Storage technology can be upgraded if fossil based energy carriers are excluded and replaced by renewable sources and if the required heat for MEA absorber regeneration is decreased by proper process improvements. In the case of the cultivation step, it is demonstrated that the efficiency of the process can be greatly affected by the illumination regimes. The light factorial optimization of Chlorella vulgaris cultivation shows that applying ideal wavelength and optimized intensity levels enhance the biomass productivity, while the biological composition (lipid and carbohydrate content) of the biomass can be shifted according to the objectives of the refinery. Hydrothermal conversion of the biomass is a favourable conversion technology due to the possible elimination of the drying step.

This article focuses on two industrial projects terminated in 2010. The analysis offers a frame for understanding the relationship between transnational politics and its local level. It reveals the limits of a technological development model that transfers the challenge of demonstrating CTSC at a European level to the demonstration sites, while ignoring the potential for politicizing this demonstration at a local level.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "f8c236ba4757d36b1d845d1e30ca5c21315a50a5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2146462078", "DOI": "10.1098/rsta.2009.0044", "CorpusId": 8613562, "PubMed": "19487210"}, "title": "A user-orientated approach to provenance capture and representation for in silico experiments, explored within the atmospheric chemistry community", "abstract": "We present a novel user-orientated approach to provenance capture and representation for in silico experiments, contrasted against the more systems-orientated approaches that have been typical within the e-Science domain.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the better options to mitigate these emissions and thereby limit global warming even while continuing the use of fossil fuels for power generation. As CCS increases the energy consumption of the power plant itself, there will be an increased use of fuel and therefore also increased environmental impacts connected to this. To calculate these impacts it is important to include the entire supply chain and life cycle of the power plant. This thesis involves a tiered hybrid life cycle assessment of natural gas- and coal power plants with chilled ammonia process (CAP) and sorption enhanced water-gas shift (SEWGS) capture technologies. These novel capture technologies are two of the least studied when it comes to environmental assessments. The results from this assessment are compared to two of the more studied capture technologies, post-combustion capture by monoethanolamine (MEA) and oxyfuel combustion capture. Both the CAP capture alternative and the SEWGS alternative have been shown to decrease the global warming potential (GWP) in a natural gas plant by 70%. For the coal-fired power plants, the CAP technology managed a decrease in GWP of 77% while the SEWGS technology showed a decrease of 77.5%. This decrease comes at a cost of other impact categories where for example the freshwater ecotoxicity potential (FETP) has an increase of 87-88% for both the CAP and SEWGS capture technologies in NGCC plants. This impact category has an increase of 25 and 22% for the CAP and SEWGS technologies in the coal-fired power plants. Compared to post-combustion capture by MEA and oxyfuel combustion capture, the results were clear on MEA being the least preferable option in an environmental perspective for both coal- and natural gas-fired power plants.

Solvent storage refers to the technique of delaying the energy-intensive step of solvent regeneration at post-combustion CCS power plants to later points in time in order to boost electrical output, and hence revenues, when electricity prices are high. This comes at the expense of needing to regenerate the stored rich solvent at a later point in time (i.e. energy penalty), as well as with the requirement for a comparatively large inventory of solvent (i.e. investment cost). An additional merit of solvent storage is the additional degree of freedom that is derived from decoupling electricity generation from the production of sequestration-ready CO2. Power plants that are fitted with the option of solvent storage can be used to balance CO2 flows feeding into transportation and storage systems in order to mitigate downstream issues arising from variable feed-flows [1-5]. Several authors have assessed the additional profits achievable with the option for solvent storage at post-combustion capture CCS power plants under historical and pre-defined price patterns (for electricity and CO2) [6-9]. Only one study [10], to the knowledge of the authors, has investigated the extent to which variable CO2 flows produced by load-following CCS power stations (coal-fired) can be smoothed out with the option for solvent storage (by decoupling electricity generation from the production of CO2). Looking at the profitability of solvent storage the general consensus is that whilst making the option available can recover the required upfront (relatively minor) investment, it does not lead to significant financial benefits in the longer term. A major drawback of most of these studies is, however, the amount of simplifying assumptions that are made in particular when it comes to underlying technical data. It is shown that depending on simplifications made the electricity and carbon price regions in which solvent storage is the profitable differ significantly. Figure 1-2 illustrates this by showing for different electricity and carbon price combinations the most profitable operating mode. Whilst solvent storage becomes profitable at around \u00a372/MWh when common simplifying technical assumptions are used in the techno-economic analysis, this threshold decreases substantially to below \u00a350/MWh under certain price combinations when the analysis is based on detailed technical modelling data.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "b14241e482f788a29aced209fe2e5f4a01c7dfa7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2160639125", "DOI": "10.1002/cphc.201500206", "CorpusId": 9207445, "PubMed": "25952008"}, "title": "CO2 Fixation into Novel CO2 Storage Materials Composed of 1,2-Ethanediamine and Ethylene Glycol Derivatives.", "abstract": "A new CO2 fixation process into solid CO2 -storage materials (CO2 SMs) under mild conditions has been developed.

Furthermore, the proposed model can not only consider the initial investment and operation costs but also take into account the expected adaptation cost to future scenarios that are generated in line with three uncertainties, namely, the traffic flow levels, conventional load levels, and renewable-based power generation levels.

The emission of pollutants from the combustion of fossil fuels in power plants lead to the development of advanced clean energy technologies, such as carbon capture and storage. Oxyfuel combustion is part of the carbon capture and storage techniques, and consists in the replacement of the air as oxidiser in the reaction with a mixture of oxygen and recycled flue gas, thus allowing a rich CO2 out-flow stream that can subsequently be compressed, transported and safely stored. \nThe number of phenomena in combustion that are inherently dynamic impede the convention of a unique conception of flame stability. However, the quantification of the flow repeatability can produce insights on the efficiency of the process. This thesis presents the assessment of the stability in swirling flows through the calculation of their spatiotemporal coherence. The experimental data obtained from a 250 kWth combustor allows the assessment of the flame by means of spectral and oscillation severity analyses. A similar methodology is developed to analyse the data from large eddy simulations. The spectral analysis, the proper orthogonal decomposition and the dynamic mode decomposition have been employed to account for the temporal, spatial and spatiotemporal coherence of the flow, respectively. The spatiotemporal coherence is employed as a comprehensive term for the characterisation of the dynamic behaviour in the swirling flows and as a measurable indicator of the stability.

In complement, direct CO2 removal from the atmosphere has been proposed after the emissions have occurred. But, the removal of all the excess anthropogenic atmospheric CO2 will not be enough, due to the fact that CO2 outgases from the ocean as its solubility is dependent of its atmospheric partial pressure.

The C stocks and CO2 emissions and removals from the HWPs in Brazil during 1900\u20132016 were evaluated using three methodological approaches: stock-change approach (SCA), production approach (PA), and stock-change of domestic origin (SCDOA). Data from the FAO\u2019s FAOSTAT system on production, import and export of semi-finished products (sawnwood, wood-based panels and paper/paperboard) were analyzed, considering distinct land-use activities: deforestation (D), forest management (FM) and afforestation/reforestation (A/R). Two scenarios to evaluate the effect of HWPs from D were evaluated. The C stock in HWPs in 2016 reached 252\u2009Mt C, by SCA. Contributions to C storage historically were higher from sawnwood, but wood-based panels and paper/paperboard have recently outperformed it. A/R is the major activity responsible for C storage in HWPs. The CO2 removal by HWPs was 521\u2009Mt during 1990\u20132016, which corresponds to 1.1% of the country\u2019s emissions in the same period.

CO2 emissions are closely related to the continual use of fossil fuels. In order to make fossil fuels sustainable, carbon capture & storage (CCS) is required to reduce CO2 emissions. There are three leading CO2 capture methods, namely post-combustion capture, oxy-fuel combustion and integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) pre-combustion capture. CO2 hydrate (CO2:6H2O) formation has been investigated as a way to capture CO2 in the IGCC conditions. \nThe formation of hydrate in this work was experimentally investigated in an isochoric system (batch mode) inside a vertical fixed bed reactor (FBR), also known as high pressure volumetric analyser (HPVA). Standard silica gel with an average particle size of 200-500 \u00b5m, mean pore size of 5.14 nm, a pore volume of 0.64 cm3/g and a surface area of 499 m2/g was used as a porous medium. The presence of hydrate in FBR was justified by using graphic methods. The solubility of CO2 in water using Henry\u2019s Law and the experimental pressure\u2013time (P-t) curve were analysed to determine the formation of hydrate. Hydrate formation was confirmed when the mole fraction of CO2 dissolved in water exceeded the Henry\u2019s Law value as well as a two-stage pressure drop in the experimental P-t curve. \nInitially, various sample preparation methods (methods 1, 2, 3 and 4) were studied leading to the selection of method 4 (the use of vigorous stirring) which had the highest moisture content (14.8 wt%) and the greatest water conversion to hydrate (40.5 mol%) at 275 K and 36 bar in a pure CO2 gas system. Also, high regeneration and repeatability of the results for all samples prepared by method 4 were expected as less water was occluded inside silica gel pores. Further investigations in pure CO2 gas systems highlighted the effect of type of silicas used, the importance of the type of promoters used, the concentration of promoters, experimental driving force, silica pore size, bed height and the amount of moisture content for formation of hydrate. \nStandard silica gel was the only silica found to show hydrate formation due to the best distribution of pore size. The high amount of bulk water inside zeolites 13X and spherical MCF-17 (21.3 and 50.8 wt% respectively) was the main reason of no hydrate formation observed. Additionally, the combined-promoters designated type T1-5 (0.01 mol% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) + 5.6 mol% tetrahydrofuran (THF)) and type T3-2 (0.01 mol% SDS + 0.1 mol% tetra-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB)) were the two best obtaining a CO2 uptake of 5.95 and 5.57 mmol of CO2 per g of H2O respectively. Ethylene glycol mono-ethyl ether (EGME; 0.1 mol%) was a good alternative to THF when combined with SDS (0.01 mol%) with a CO2 uptake of 5.45 mmol of CO2 per g of H2O for this combined-promoter designated type T1A-2. In addition, the CO2 uptake increased as \u2206P increased or \u2206T decreased. Moreover, mesoporous silica (silica gel) performed better than microporous silica (zeolite 13X) where the formation of hydrate by zeolite 13X was observed with minimal CO2 uptake (0.58 mmol of CO2 per g of H2O) when the bed height was reduced. Additionally, the total amount of CO2 consumed through hydrate formation increased as the amount of water inside mesoporous silica increased which was not the case for microporous silica. \nFurthermore, the experiments performed in the IGCC conditions (283 K and 70 bar) by employing T1-5 and T3-2 in a fuel gas mixture demonstrated low hydrate formation with a CO2 uptake of 1.5 and 1.1 mmol of CO2 per g of H2O respectively. This was expected due to the slow kinetics since CO2 molecules were competing with H2 molecules which also reduced the selectivity of CO2 molecules during hydrate formation. Hence, in reality, pure CO2 system is the best option for CCS through hydrate formation at the right operating conditions as compared to fuel gas mixture.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "246d577d87d0ddaaa53e60179de27ecfb34664d7", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s11356-021-15121-9", "CorpusId": 235677837, "PubMed": "34189695"}, "title": "A review on application of activated carbons for carbon dioxide capture: present performance, preparation, and surface modification for further improvement", "abstract": "The atmosphere security and regulation of climate change are being continuously highlighted as a pressing issue. The crisis of climate change owing to the anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission has led many governments at federal and provincial levels to promulgate policies to address this concern. Among them is regulating the carbon dioxide emission from major industrial sources such as power plants, petrochemical industries, cement plants, and other industries that depend on the combustion of fossil fuels for energy to operate. In view of this, various CO2 capture and sequestration technologies have been investigated and presented. From this review, adsorption of CO2 on porous solid materials has been gaining increasing attention due to its cost-effectiveness, ease of application, and comparably low energy demand. Despite the myriad of advanced materials such as zeolites, carbons-based, metal-organic frameworks, mesoporous silicas, and polymers being researched, research on activated carbons (ACs) continue to be in the mainstream. Therefore, this review is endeavored to elucidate the adsorption properties of CO2 on activated carbons derived from different sources. Selective adsorption based on pore size/shape and surface chemistry is investigated. Accordingly, the effect of surface modifications of the ACs with NH3, amines, and metal oxides on adsorption performance toward CO2 is evaluated. The adsorption performance of the activated carbons under humid conditions is also reviewed. Finally, activated carbon-based composite has been surveyed and recommended as a feasible strategy to improve AC adsorption properties toward CO2.

When measured as cross-emissions elasticity, ancillary CO2 abatement from unit % reduction of NOx and SO2 emissions is substantially greater in China under stringent targets, though comparable between the two countries under moderate targets. In contrast, NOx and SO2 abatement from unit % reduction of CO2 emissions is much greater in the U.S. than in China, regardless of the stringency of the policy shock. These results are primarily driven by China\u2019s higher dependence on coal, as coal has larger unit emission-reduction effects than other fossil fuels and its intensive use creates more room for less costly fuel-switching and abatement options. In addition, pollution-abatement co-benefits of carbon mitigation tend to be greater than carbon-mitigation co-benefits of NOx and SO2 reduction in the U.S., while the opposite is the case for China. The relatively low pollution-abatement effects of carbon mitigation policy in China are primarily due to the expanded role of carbon capture and storage technology, which keeps coal from being crowded out of the energy market by reducing its carbon emission factors, but without affecting NOx and SO2 emissions. Our study suggests that some countries like China may consider it more appealing to pursue the synergy from a pollution-control perspective than from a carbon-mitigation standpoint, given the former\u2019s greater synergistic effects.

The methane could be either converted into syngas in the Steam Methane Reformer (SMR) for synthetic fuels production or used as SNG after going through the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reactor.

On the other hand, the pressure of greenhouse effect urges us to find new ways to deal with carbon dioxide emission. As an important part in the Carbon Capture and Storage System, CO2 is injected into the shale gas reservoir in order to enhance the gas production through competitive absorption between methane and carbon dioxide. In shale reservoir, carbon dioxide is much stronger in adsorption than methane, so the adsorption methane will be desorbed into the free phase by carbon dioxide. More shale gas is then produced by reducing its partial pressure during the production period. It is estimated that continuous carbon dioxide injection at overpressures of 8 MPa enhance gas recovery of 28.5% respectively over 30 years . Moreover, in reservoir of high water sensitivity, CO2 has its advantage for the limitations of hydraulic fracturing . Thus, the technique of carbon dioxide displacement of the methane stored in the shale nanopores is of great significance for future exploitation of shale gas as well as the efficient application of carbon dioxide. However, there is currently limited understanding of the mechanism of competitive absorption between methane and carbon dioxide, especially in nanopores under 10 nm, where how effectively carbon dioxide replace methane is of great importance for the production of shale gas. Although the similar mechanism in CO2 enhanced coal bed methane (CO2-ECBM) has been studied for many years , the research in shale gas has its unique challenge due to the ultra-low permeability and ultracomplex pore structures in the shale rock .

An important aspect of CCS is the Measuring, Monitoring, and Verification program, which is needed to ensure safe CO2 injection and storage.

This study focuses on the risk and impact of the CO2 once it escapes the overlying sediments and enters the marine environment.\n To describe the behavior of leaked CO2 in the marine environment, it is important to understand the ambient flow conditions at the identified area that would govern the advection and dispersion processes in the seawater column. Hence, long-term 3D-hydrodynamic modelling is conducted to describe seasonal and inter-annual variations of hydrodynamic conditions at the area of interest. Supplementing the flow model is the coupled physical-chemical reactions that will occur if CO2 escapes into the seawater. As CO2 bubbles ascend in the water column, their volume changes because of gas dissolution and reduction in hydrostatic pressure. Additionally, as CO2 gas dissolves in seawater, concentration of the Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) increases, which in turn leads to reduction of pH in the seawater. Thus, the risk and effects of CO2 leakage to the marine environment will be reflected by reduction of the pH from its natural variation. Scenario of CO2 seepage from plugged and abandoned (P&A) well was simulated based on hypothetical leakage rates derived from previous studies.\n Far-field modelling results of CO2 seepage from the P&A well suggest that no CO2 gas would reach the surface and escape into the atmosphere. The CO2 would dissolve rapidly above the seabed. Any reduction in pH values within the far-field is predicted to be within the natural variation of the seawater acidity with the varying climatic conditions. To fully capture the near-field dispersion effects, additional finer resolution modelling was performed for three representative climatic periods (or monsoons). Results suggest that the near-field plume where pH falls below 6.5 (threshold limit based on Malaysia Marine Water Quality Criteria and Standard) is usually confined within 100 m radius but may extend to 200 m from the leakage source. However, the near field model also confirms rapid dissolution of CO2 gas within the first 5 m water column above the seabed.\n The study result can be used as an important input in designing X-Field's MMV operational plan in terms of optimizing sampling volume and frequencies for marine water monitoring purposes, which may result in significant operational cost reduction. Hence, similar study is recommended to be conducted with the same purpose in future CCS related projects due to its impact on the technical and economical value creation.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "8122e274bbdae048307b7ab8a6be23c562a797a6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2889705485", "DOI": "10.7251/AGRENG1802080L", "CorpusId": 59364083}, "title": "CARBON STORAGE IN SHELTERBELTS IN THE AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS OF THE BA\u010cKA PALANKA AREA (SERBIA)", "abstract": "Field shelterbelts as agroforestry practice provides numerous ecosystem services.Carbon capture and storage potential in biomass and soil is among regulatingservices shelterbelts provide.

Despite several experiments have reported SOC sequestration with the adoption of no-tillage (NT) in Mediterranean dryland agroecosystems scarce information exists about the duration and magnitude of the sequestration process. For this reason, 20\u00a0years ago we established in northeast Spain a NT chronosequence experiment to evaluate SOC sequestration duration under Mediterranean dryland conditions.MethodsIn July 2010 we sampled five chronosequence phases with different years under NT (i.e., 1, 4, 11, and 20\u00a0years) and a continuous conventional tillage (CT) field, in which management prevailed unchanged during decades. Soil samples were taken at four depths: 0\u20135, 5\u201310, 10\u201320 and 20\u201330\u00a0cm. The SOC stocks were calculated from the SOC concentration and soil bulk density. Furthermore, we applied the Century ecosystem model to the different stages of the chronosequence to better understand the factors controlling SOC sequestration with NT adoption.ResultsDifferences in SOC stocks were only found in the upper 5\u00a0cm soil layer in which 4, 11 and 20\u00a0years under NT showed greater SOC stocks compared with 1\u00a0year under NT and the CT phase. Despite no significant differences were found in the total SOC stock (0\u201330\u00a0cm soil layer) there was a noteworthy difference of 5.7\u00a0Mg ha\u22121 between the phase with the longest NT duration and the phase under conventional tillage. The maximum annual SOC sequestration occurred after 5\u00a0years of NT adoption with almost 50% change in the annual rate of SOC sequestration. NT sequestered SOC over the 20\u00a0years following the change in management. However, more than 75% of the total SOC sequestered was gained during the first 11\u00a0years after NT adoption.

In 2002 alone, the production of oil, gas and coal contributed over $30 billion to the Canadian economy. Fossil fuel is presently the world\u2019s most abundant, economical and reliable fuel for energy production. However, the industry now faces a major challenge because the production of fossil fuels including coal, crude oil and gas, and the processes currently used for energy production from such fuels, can have adverse environmental consequences. Hence, along with the positive economic advantages of energy production using fossil fuels come the responsibility of mitigating the consequent adverse environmental and climate-change impacts (Harrison et al., 2007). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an approach for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the environment by capturing and storing the CO2 gas instead of releasing it into the air. The application of CCS to a modern conventional power plant could reduce CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80-90% compared to a plant without CCS (IPCC, Metz, & Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Working Group III, 2005). CO2 capture technologies mainly include: chemical absorption, physical absorption, membrane separation and cryogenic fractionation. Among these technologies, chemical absorption of CO2 is one of the most mature technologies because of its efficiency and low cost. The highly complex CO2 absorption process generates a vast amount of data, which need to be monitored. However, industry process control systems do not typically incorporate operators' heuristics in their intelligent control or data analysis functionalities. Our objective is to construct an intelligent data management and analysis system that incorporates such human experts' heuristics. The Data Analysis Decision Support System (DADSS) for CO2 capture process reported in (Wu & Chan, 2009) is a step towards filling this gap in automated control systems. However, the DADSS is a standalone PC-based system with limited flexibility and connectivity. In this paper we present a web-based CO2 data management and analysis system (CO2DMA), which overcomes these limitations. The system presented in this paper was built based on data acquired from the Pilot Plant CO2 capture process of the International Test Centre for CO2 capture (ITC), located at the University of Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada.

The current flood mitigation was more on the urgent need to provide immediate flood relief works. Thus, integrating flood reservoir with pumped hydropower storage seems a promising solutions for flood problems. Pumped hydropower storage is basically known as a storage device that can improve the reliability of the intermittent source of wind energy. But, there is an issue with the cost of a wind power pumped hydropower storage (WPHS) as it can be expensive to construct. Thus, WPHS requires an additional value so that it is worth to construct this storage facility. The reservoir of WPHS can store huge amount of water and if it is designed with similar mechanism of flood reservoir, it may be capable to mitigate flood during extreme hydrological events and render significant benefits, especially in the terms of economic aspects. Due to the feasibility of WPHS reservoir in flood mitigation and the high cost of the projects, it is beneficial to study economic and environmental aspects of WPHS. Thus, this research aims to evaluate economic and environmental performances of wind-power pumped hydropower storage integrated flood mitigation system. The Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software was used to simulate and compare power generation system with and without the flood reservoir. Then, the economic aspects of each system were evaluated based on the Net Present Cost (NPC) and Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). Meanwhile, environmental impacts were evaluated based on the amount of air pollutants released to the environment. It was found that the estimated volume of the reservoir to attenuate flood event was 8,396,256 m3 and the proposed power system was estimated to support 69% of energy demand in one of the flood-prone areas with a mean value of power output being 0.7 MW and power input 1.2 MW. Based on the simulation in HOMER, the grid standalone system (B-I) which is without flood reservoir is the optimum system with the NPC only RM 0.38 million and the LCOE RM 0.246/kWh. But, when the cost of flood losses are internalised in the total NPC, the wind-diesel with reservoir storage system (A-III) and the wind-grid with the pumped hydro storage system (B-III) will have much lower NPC than other systems that do not include reservoir for flood mitigation. The NPC for system A-III is RM 1.52 million and for system B-I is RM 1.37 million; meanwhile, the NPC for system B-I is RM 10.4 million when the cost of flood losses are included in the total NPC. Between both energy systems which included the reservoir in their design, the amount of pollutants emitted by the A-III system is 408 kg of carbon dioxide per year which is much less than the B-III system which is 29,662 kg of carbon dioxide during similar period. Therefore, it can be said that the A-III system is the most optimum power generation system as it offers benefits in both economic and environmental aspects. But, the suggested size of reservoir for A-III only can capture 20.8 % of excess runoff generated from the whole Pahang basin. It is almost impossible to expect only a reservoir to capture all excess runoff generated from a large basin. A few reservoir can be built at each sub basin to capture the excess runoff as a flood prevention. In conclusion, the WPHS integrated with flood mitigation system seems beneficial in the term of economic and environment.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "efd92f6a60c902f4e7117d2066ac460c989fe359", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1530052046", "CorpusId": 129341861}, "title": "Forests and Climate Change: Cause, Casualty and the Opportunity to Capture Co-Benefits", "abstract": "The relationships between forests and climate change are complex and multidimensional.

New initiatives toward \u2018Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation\u2019 (REDD) will face similar challenges, but could bring to bear new sources of finance and political will. Forests are also vulnerable to the direct impacts of climate change. Warming temperatures, increased variability of rainfall patterns and increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events will all affect the ability of forests to continue providing goods and services to local communities and to society at large. Because healthy forests are more resilient to climate change, sustainable forest management must be given more emphasis in national adaptation strategies. Forest-related mitigation and adaptation strategies are also inter-linked: the permanence of carbon currently stored in forests is at risk from climate change, with some models predicting significant loss of forests due to climate change impacts. Improved forest management in the interest of climate change mitigation and adaptation offers significant potential for co-benefits. The wealth of biodiversity harboured by tropical forests currently being eroded by deforestation and forest degradation can be conserved through management strategies that include biodiversity as well as carbon storage and adaptation objectives. While there will certainly be trade-offs between efficiency and equity, REDD initiatives provide a potential new source of income for rural communities.

Revegetation has been implemented to control soil erosion and improve ecosystems in the Loess Plateau region through a series of ecological recovery programs. However, the increasing atmospheric CO2 as a result of human intervention is affecting the climate by global warming, resulting in the greater frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as storms that may weaken the effectiveness of revegetation and cause severe soil erosion. Most research to date has evaluated the effectiveness of revegetation on soil properties and soil erosion of different land use or vegetation types. Here, we study the effect of revegetation on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and erosion-induced carbon loss related to different plant communities, particularly under extreme rainstorm events. Materials and methods: The erosion-pin method was used to quantify soil erosion, and soil samples were taken at soil depths of 0\u20135 cm, 5\u201310 cm and 10\u201320 cm to determine the SOC content for 13 typical hillside revegetation communities in the year of 2013, which had the highest rainfall with broad range, long duration and high intensity since 1945, in the Yanhe watershed. Results and discussion: The SOC concentrations of all plant communities increased with soil depth when compared with slope cropland, and significant increases (p < 0.05) were observed for most shrub and forest communities, particularly for natural ones. Taking the natural secondary forest community as reference (i.e., soil loss and SOC loss were both 1.0), the relative soil loss and SOC loss of the other 12 plant communities in 2013 ranged from 1.5 to 9.4 and 0.30 to 1.73, respectively. Natural shrub and forest communities showed greater resistance to rainstorm erosion than grassland communities. The natural grassland communities with lower SOC content produced lower SOC loss even with higher soil loss, natural secondary forest communities produced higher SOC loss, primarily because of their higher SOC content, and the artificial R. pseudoacacia community with greater soil loss produced higher SOC loss. Conclusions: These results indicate that natural revegetation is more effective in enhancing SOC storage and reducing soil erosion than artificial vegetative recovery on hillsides.

However, data on belowground carbon cycling in the tropics is sparse, and the role of moisture on soil carbon dynamics is underrepresented in current land surface models limiting our ability to extrapolate from field experiments to the entire region. We measured radiocarbon (C) and calculated turnover rates of organic matter from 37 soil profiles from the Neotropics including sites in Mexico, Brazil, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, and Peru.

Global warming is mainly due to the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) and carbon dioxide (CO2) is known to be the major contributor to the GHG emission profile. Whilst the energy sector is the primary source for CO2 emission, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) are believed to be the solution for controlling this emission. Oxyfuel combustion (Oxy-combustion) is one of the major technologies for capturing CO2 from power plants. For gas turbines, several Oxy-combustion power cycles (Oxyturbine cycles) have been investigated by means of thermodynamic analysis. NetPower cycle is one of the leading oxyturbine power cycles with almost full carbon capture capability from a natural gas fired power plant. In this manuscript, sensitivity analysis of the heat exchanger design in NetPower cycle is completed by means of process modelling. The heat capacity variation and supercritical CO2 with gaseous admixtures are considered for multi-zone analysis with Aspen Plus software. It is found that the heat exchanger design has a major role to increase the efficiency of NetPower cycle. The pinch-point analysis is done to extract the composite and grand composite curve for the heat exchanger. In this paper, relationship between the cycle efficiency and the minimum approach temperature (\u2206Tmin) of the heat exchanger has also been evaluated. Increase in \u2206Tmin causes a decrease in the temperature of the recycle flue gases (RFG) and an overall decrease in the required power for the recycled gas compressor. The main challenge in the design of heat exchangers in power plants is a tradeoff between the capital and operational costs. To achieve lower \u2206Tmin, larger size of heat exchanger is required. This means a higher capital cost but leading to a better heat recovery and lower operational cost. To achieve this, \u2206Tmin is selected from the minimum point in the diagrams of capital and operational costs.

Soils were humic loamy soils and site characteristics that may affect soil C were as uniform as possible (slope, elevation, texture, soil type, vegetation).Three areas were selected, with adjacent sites of various ages of cultivation (3 to 35 yr), and paired control forest sites. The ploughed horizon (0-Dt cm) and the Dt-50 cm layer were collected at each agricultural site. In forest sites, each 10 cm layer was collected systematically down to 1 meter depth. Carbon concentrations were converted to total content to a given depth as the product of concentration, depth of sample and bulk density, and expressed in units of kg m-2. For each site and each sampled layer, the mineral mass of soil was calculated, in order to base comparisons on the same soil mass rather than the same depth.The pattern of C accumulation in forest soils showed an exponential decrease with depth. Results suggested that soil organic carbon declined rapidly during the first years of cultivation, and at a slower rate thereafter. This pattern of decrease can be fitted by a bi-exponential model assuming that initial soil organic carbon can be separated into two parts, a very labile pool reduced during the first rapid decline and more refractory fractions oxidizing at a slower rate. Sampling to shallow depths (0-Dt cm) resulted in over-estimation of the rate of carbon release in proportion to the initial amount of C, and in under-estimation of the total loss of C with age. The results for the 0\u201350 cm horizon indicated that losses of total carbon average about 50% in these soils, ranging in initial carbon content from 19 to 32.5 kg m-2. Carbon release to the atmosphere averaged 0.8 kg m-2 yr-1 to 50 cm depth during the first 10 years of cultivation.

This will involve many thousands of miles of dedicated high-pressure pipelines in order to transport many millions of tonnes of CO2 annually, with the CO2 delivered to many thousands of wells that will inject the CO2 underground. The new CCS infrastructure could rival in size the current U.S. upstream natural gas pipeline and well infrastructure. This new infrastructure entails hazards for life, health, animals, the environment, and natural resources. Pipelines are known to rupture due to corrosion, from external forces such as impacts by vehicles or digging equipment, by defects in construction, or from the failure of valves and seals. Similarly, wells are vulnerable to catastrophic failure due to corrosion, cement degradation, or operational mistakes. While most accidents involving pipelines and wells will be minor, there is the inevitable possibility of accidents with very high consequences, especially to public health. The most important consequence of concern is CO2 release to the environment in concentrations sufficient to cause death by asphyxiation to nearby populations. Such accidents are thought to be very unlikely, but of course they cannot be excluded, even if major engineering effort is devoted (as it will be) to keeping their probability low and their consequences minimized. This project has developed a methodology for analyzing the risks of these rare but high-consequence accidents, using a step-by-step probabilistic methodology. A key difference between risks for pipelines and wells is that the former are spatially distributed along the pipe whereas the latter are confined to the vicinity of the well. Otherwise, the methodology we develop for risk assessment of pipeline and well failures is similar and provides an analysis both of the annual probabilities of accident sequences of concern and of their consequences, and crucially the methodology provides insights into what measures might be taken to mitigate those accident sequences identified as of concern. Mitigating strategies could address reducing the likelihood of an accident sequence of concern, or reducing the consequences, or some combination. The methodology elucidates both local and integrated risks along the pipeline or at the well providing information useful to decision makers at various levels including local (e.g., property owners and town councils), regional (e.g., county and state representatives), and national levels (federal regulators and corporate proponents).", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "f9758262aa92741bb2acd5e3a7ce2bac52a0e666", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2587085792", "CorpusId": 185548329}, "title": "CO2 storage capacity assessment of deep saline aquifers in Malaysia", "abstract": "The increasing amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere recently has become one of the discussed topics in relation with world\u2019s concern on climate change.

This study is the first of its kind that made an identification of potential storage sites and assessment of CO 2 storage capacity within the deep saline aquifers in the country. The CO 2 storage capacity in saline formation assessment was conducted based on the method for quick assessment of CO 2 storage capacity in closed and semi closed saline formations modified to suit the geology setting of Malaysia. Then, an integrated approach that involved geographic information systems(GIS)analysis and field data assessment was adopted to provide the potential storage sites and its capacity for CO 2 sequestration. This study concentrated on the assessment of major sedimentary basins in Malaysia both onshore and offshore where potential geological formations which CO 2 could be stored exist below 800 meters and where suitable sealing formations are present.

The paper first introduces the concept of storage in deep sedimentary formations, the geomechanical processes and issues related with such an operation, and the relevant geomechanical modeling tools. This is followed by a more detailed review of geomechanical aspects, including reservoir stress-strain and microseismicity, well integrity, caprock sealing performance, and the potential for fault reactivation and notable (felt) seismic events. Geomechanical observations at current GCS field deployments, mainly at the In Salah CO2 storage project in Algeria, are also integrated into the review. The In Salah project, with its injection into a relatively thin, low-permeability sandstone is an excellent analogue to the saline aquifers that might be used for large scale GCS in parts of Northwest Europe, the U.S. Midwest, and China. Some of the lessons learned at In Salah related to geomechanics are discussed, including how monitoring of geomechanical responses is used for detecting subsurface geomechanical changes and tracking fluid movements, and how such monitoring and geomechanical analyses have led to preventative changes in the injection parameters. Recently, the importance of geomechanics has become more widely recognized among GCS stakeholders, especially with respect to the potential for triggering notable (felt) seismic events and how such events could impact the long-term integrity of a CO2 repository (as well as how it could impact the public perception of GCS). As described in the paper, to date, no notable seismic event has been reported from any of the current CO2 storage projects, although some unfelt microseismic activities have been detected by geophones. However, potential future commercial GCS operations from large power plants will require injection at a much larger scale.

This FWP is funded through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA). Overall, the NRAP activities are focused on understanding and evaluating risks associated with large-scale injection and long-term storage of CO{sub 2} in deep geological formations. One of the primary risks during large-scale injection is due to changes in geomechanical stresses to the storage reservoir, to the caprock/seals and to the wellbores. These changes may have the potential to cause CO{sub 2} and brine leakage and geochemical impacts to the groundwater systems. While the importance of these stresses is well recognized, there have been relatively few quantitative studies (laboratory, field or theoretical) of geomechanical processes in sequestration systems. In addition, there are no integrated studies that allow evaluation of risks to groundwater quality in the context of CO{sub 2} injection-induced stresses. The work performed under this project is focused on better understanding these effects. LANL approach will develop laboratory and computational tools to understand the impact of CO{sub 2}-induced mechanical stress by creating a geomechanical test bed using inputs from laboratory experiments, fieldmore\u00a0\u00bb data, and conceptual approaches. The Geomechanical Test Bed will be used for conducting sensitivity and scenario analyses of the impacts of CO{sub 2} injection. The specific types of questions will relate to fault stimulation and fracture inducing stress on caprock, changes in wellbore leakage due to evolution of stress in the reservoir and caprock, and the potential for induced seismicity. In addition, the Geomechanical Test Bed will be used to investigate the coupling of stress-induced leakage pathways with impacts on groundwater quality. LANL activities are performed under two tasks: (1) develop laboratory and computational tools to understand CO{sub 2}-induced mechanical impacts and (2) use natural analog sites to determine potential groundwater impacts.

Understanding the effects of introducing broadleaved tree in monospecific coniferous plantation on ecosystem carbon (C) storage and soil organic C (SOC) stability is critical to improve our understanding of forest C sequestration and C cycle.MethodsPlots were established in subtropical plantations with a randomized block design to examine the influence of introducing Michelia macclurei trees into pure Cunninghamia lanceolata plantation on biomass C storage, SOC storage of total, labile, and recalcitrant fractions (0\u201340\u00a0cm depth), and SOC stability.ResultsIntroducing M. macclurei trees increased biomass C by 17.9\u00a0% and 14.2\u00a0% compared with monospecific C. lanceolata and M. macclurei plantations, respectively. Storage of different SOC fractions was not significantly different between monospecific C. lanceolata and mixed plantations. SOC stability in bulk soils was not affected, although it differed in 10\u201320\u00a0cm and 20\u201340\u00a0cm soil depth among three plantations.ConclusionsMixed species plantations can increase C sequestration, and in the subtropical forest ecosystem examined this was mainly attributed to an increase in biomass C.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "9eeffc36a5ecc26a5e86b299a060777c8f9a365a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2765240487", "CorpusId": 67811679}, "title": "Chemical and calcium looping systems : heat integration analysis for improvement the energy efficiency of various industrial processes", "abstract": "Improvement of energy efficiency for key industrial sectors is of great importance today considering the potential economic and environmental benefits. The carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies are considered strategically important technological options for transition to a low carbon economy. In this respect the chemical & calcium looping systems are very promising methods to deliver both high energy efficiency and near zero CO2 emissions. This paper assesses the potential gains in term of energy efficiency for key illustrative fossil fuel-based industrial processes (e.g. combustion and gasification-based power plants, cement production plant, integrated steel mill, energy vector polygeneration systems etc.) by integration of chemical and calcium looping systems as carbon capture technologies. Two high temperature solid looping systems were evaluated in details: a chemical looping cycle using iron oxide as oxygen carrier and a calcium looping cycle using calcium-based sorbent. The carbon capture rate of all evaluated chemical & calcium looping concepts is almost total (>95%). As the detailed results show, the chemical & calcium looping systems exhibit superior energy efficiency, lower plant complexity and reduced CO2 emissions in comparison to the more commercially and technologically mature carbon capture options (e.g. based on chemical or physical gas-liquid absorption). INTRODUCTION The heat and power sector as well as other energy-intensive industrial applications are facing significant challenges in the attempt to curb theirs fossil CO2 emissions for transition to a low carbon economy [1]. The reduce the carbon footprint of energy-intensive processes as well as to increase the overall energy efficiency, the innovative solution need to be developed and deployed in industrial practice. To boost the development of energy-intensive processes with low fossil carbon emissions, technical, economic and politic instruments are used [2]. On the technological development front, the CCUS technologies are considered strategically important options for transition to a low carbon economy in the fight to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions and to combat the climate change [3]. Chemical & calcium looping methods are innovative high energy efficiency carbon capture method suitable to be applied in various energy-intensive industrial applications [4]. The high temperature looping methods are promising in delivering both high energy efficiency and low CO2 emissions. The main advantages of chemical & calcium looping conversion are [5]: inherently CO2 capture with no significant ancillary energy duty, high temperature heat recovery which contributes to the increasing of overall energy efficiency, fuel flexibility etc. This paper assessed the potential advantages of chemical & calcium looping cycles in term of improving the energy efficiency for energy-intensive industrial processes (illustrative cases from various industrial sectors were selected). The chemical & calcium looping designs were thermodynamically modelled and simulated using process flow modelling software (ChemCAD). The improvement of the energy efficiency by heat integration analysis was carefully evaluated for various industrial size conceptual designs (e.g. about 500 MW net electricity power plants, 1 Mt/y cement production plant, 4 Mt/y integrated steel mill etc.). As the heat and power integration tool, the pinch method was used [6]. The mass and energy balances for the illustrative thermally integrated industrial size examples were then used to evaluate the overall performance indicators (e.g. energy efficiency, fossil fuel consumption, ancillary heat and power consumption, carbon capture rate, specific CO2 emissions etc.). Benchmark cases of the investigated processes are also considered for comparison reasons in both situations: without carbon capture and with carbon capture using gas-liquid absorption. CHEMICAL & CALCIUM LOOPING SYSTEMS High temperature solid looping systems are promising option to reduce both energy and cost penalties for CO2 capture. Two looping cycles were assessed in this paper in conjunction with various energy-intensive industrial applications. The first chemical looping system is based on iron oxides used as oxygen carrier for fuel oxidation. In the chemical looping systems, various oxygen carriers (usually metallic oxides of Ni, Fe, Cu, Mn etc.) are used to totally or partially oxidise the fuel [4]. The cycle involves two (for chemical looping combustion) or three (for combined heat & hydrogen production) interconnected fluidised bed reactors. 13th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "c1e8fc08eb316f33b7bd7de6e515050fc80c27f5", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 235096918}, "title": "CO 2-aren erabilera , berotegi-efektua murrizteko estrategia ( Co 2 utilization , a strategy for limiting greenhouse effect )", "abstract": "Climate change \u2014caused mainly by the utilization of fossil fuels\u2014 has aroused great interest in the last decades. Among the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant, and thus, limiting its emissions is a key issue to mitigate climate change. In light of this perspective, carbon dioxide capture and utilization (CCU) technology could be used. For this purpose, the CO2 produced in power plants and industries needs to be captured, before dumping it to the atmosphere. Then, CO2 is transported to the facilities for its industrial utilization, to be converted into commercial products. CO2 can be used directly, without conversion, for different purposes: desalination of water, surface cleaning, food or drink production, and injection for enhanced recovery of oil or natural gas. CO2 can also be regarded as a feedstock by processing and converting it into chemicals and fuels. The main advantage of CCU technology is that it can turn the utilization of waste CO2 emissions into a profitable activity, as products can be sold. However, this technology has several drawbacks, such as: (i) the current demand for chemicals does not have the capacity to sequester enough CO2 emissions to contribute significantly to meeting the carbon reduction targets, (ii) using CO2 for fuel production only delays its emissions, (iii) the \u00abstorage\u00bb in some chemicals is also short-lived, depending on their use.

Using the remote sensing satellite imagery (Landsat) we explore the role of land use land cover change (LULCC) in modifying the terrestrial carbon sequestration. We have constructed our LULCC data over Wallonia, Belgium, and compared it with the ground-based statistical data. However, the results from the satellite base LULCC are overestimating the forest data due to the single isolated trees. We know forests play an important role in mitigating climate change by capturing and sequestering atmospheric carbon. Overall, the conversion of land and increase in urban land can impact the environment. Moreover, quantitative estimation of the temporal and spatial pattern of carbon storage with the change in land use land cover is critical to estimate. The objective of this study is to estimate the inter-annual variability in carbon sequestration with the change in land use land cover. Here, with the CARAIB dynamic vegetation model, we perform simulations using remote sensing satellite-based LULCC data to analyse the sensitivity of the carbon sequestration. We propose a new method of using satellite and machine learning-based observation to reconstruct historical LULCC. It will quantify the spatial and temporal variability of land-use change during the 1985-2020 periods over Wallonia, Belgium at high resolution. This study will give the space to analyse past information and hence calibrate the dynamic vegetation model to minimize uncertainty in the future projection (until 2070).

Injecting CO2 into depleted oil reservoirs can reach the dual goal of carbon storage and enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR). To optimize the gas injection strategy, it is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms of three-phase fluid flow of oil, water and gas. In this study, a lattice Boltzmann (LB) color gradient model is used to investigate pore-scale three-phase displacement process in porous media. Gas is injected into the porous domain initially occupied by water and oil. Typical microscopic behaviors, including coalescence and split-up, pinch-off, double and multiple displacement, as well as parallel flow, are identified and discussed. Effects of water content ( \u03d5), capillary number ( Ca), wettability and viscosity ratio ( M) on the flow pattern and oil recovery rate are explored. The oil ganglia inhibit the development of gas fingers, causing stronger viscous fingering characteristics with increasing \u03d5. The fingering pattern located in the crossover zone for the Ca from 5\u00d710-5 to 5\u00d710-4. As \u03d5 increases, the oil recovery rate reduces. The oil ganglia tend to occupy small pores as oil wettability enhanced, making it more difficult to be drained out. The reduction of oil viscosity is beneficial to improve connectivity, thereby effectively enhancing the oil recovery. Finally, the CO2 storage rate is also evaluated. It is found that the storage rate is very sensitive to the initial oil-water distributions.

To better characterize carbon stocks in seagrass beds of varying structure and composition, and to further expand the current \u201cBlue Carbon\u201d database to under-represented regions, we evaluate the extent of Corg stocks in the relatively undocumented seagrass meadows of the Arabian Gulf. Surveys were conducted along the coast of Abu Dhabi (UAE) and encompassed sites ranging from sheltered embayments to offshore islands. Seagrass beds consisted of Halodule uninervis, Halophila ovalis and Halophila stipulacea.

After 4 weeks of storage under anaerobic conditions at 15\u200a\u200a\u00b0C, the NH4+ N content exceeded the original urinary N content of the slurry; the NH4+ content increased only slightly during the following 16 weeks of storage.

To understand the underlying benefit of CO2 capture process, cradle-to-gate life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) of the power plants using fossil sources (e.g. natural gas, coal) can provide an in-depth insight. This paper aims to conduct life cycle impact assessment on natural gas and coal (sub critical and supercritical) fired power plants with and without CO2 capture facility for comparison of overall impact on the environment.
