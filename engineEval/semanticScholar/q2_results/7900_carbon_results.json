We evaluated peat volume from two commonly referenced maps of peat distribution and depth published by Wetlands International (WI) and the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture (MoA), and used regionally specific values of carbon density to calculate carbon stocks.ResultsPeatland extent and volume published in the MoA maps are lower than those in the WI maps, resulting in lower estimates of carbon storage. We estimate Indonesia\u2019s total peat carbon store to be within 13.6\u00a0GtC (the low MoA map estimate) and 40.5\u00a0GtC (the high WI map estimate) with a best estimate of 28.1 GtC: the midpoint of medium carbon stock estimates derived from WI (30.8\u00a0GtC) and MoA (25.3\u00a0GtC) maps. This estimate is about half of previous assessments which used an assumed average value of peat thickness for all Indonesian peatlands, and revises the current global tropical peat carbon pool to 75\u00a0GtC. Yet, these results do not diminish the significance of Indonesia\u2019s peatlands, which store an estimated 30% more carbon than the biomass of all Indonesian forests. The largest discrepancy between maps is for the Papua province, which accounts for 62\u201371% of the overall differences in peat area, volume and carbon storage. According to the MoA map, 80% of Indonesian peatlands are\u00a0<300\u00a0cm thick and thus vulnerable to conversion outside of protected areas according to environmental regulations. The carbon contained in these shallower peatlands is conservatively estimated to be 10.6 GtC, equivalent to 42% of Indonesia\u2019s total peat carbon and about 12\u00a0years of global emissions from land use change at current rates.ConclusionsConsidering the high uncertainties in peatland extent, volume and carbon storage revealed in this assessment of current maps, a systematic revision of Indonesia\u2019s peat maps to produce a single geospatial reference that is universally accepted would improve national peat carbon storage estimates and greatly benefit carbon cycle research, land use management and spatial planning.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "3e7d678e4db2cc10e6a99eff36b5fcb7b957d735", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.20944/preprints202106.0212.v2", "CorpusId": 236232725}, "title": "Sequestering Biomass for Natural, Efficient, and Low-Cost Direct Air Capture of Carbon Dioxide", "abstract": "Many corporations and governments aspire to become Net Zero Carbon Dioxide by 2030-2050.

This paper presents a review of the published work investigating the potential alteration of rock properties due to short to long term CO2-host rock chemical interactions during commercial scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) operations. Furthermore, the authors of this paper are attempting to highlight the potential significance of these mechanical-chemical effect on the fault reactivation potential for a commercial scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) operation.\n The reactive nature between CO2 dissolved in formation water and the storage reservoir can significantly alter the hydraulic and mechanical properties of the host rock, which could in turn affect the storage potential of the target reservoir. Alteration of the host rock mineralogy due to chemical interactions with CO2 have been well studied (Farquhar et al. 2015), but little is available in the published literature on the resulting changes in rock elastic properties (i.e. Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio) due to these reactions. Some recent experimental studies have suggested significant changes in rock properties occur. When we incorporated the geomechanical effects, induced by the rock elastic property changes documented in these published cases, into both 1D analytical and 3D numerical models based fault stability analyses for a Surat Basin reservoir, we observed significant modification of the reservoir storage capacity prior to reaching fault reactivation criteria.\n Based on our review of the published literature and our fault stability analyses, we conclude that the chemical effects of CO2 interaction with host rock needs to be experimentally tested to confirm if these effects are significant.

This is cause by the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) especially carbon dioxide (CO2). Forest plays a vital role in controlling the capacity of atmosphere CO2 where they are also known as a \u2018carbon sinker\u2019 as they manage to significantly capture carbon and store them as biomass. Tropical forest ecosystem is believed to sequester a large number of carbon (C) compared to other natural ecosystem where the majority of C stored in the aboveground vegetation. In Malaysia, accurate information on aboveground carbon storage is lacking. Hence,the objectives of this study were to estimate and develop equations of biomass in logged-over tropical lowland forest, measure wood density of selected trees in the study area and to quantify carbon in different type of aboveground biomass components. This study was conducted at two logged-over tropical lowland forest; Bubu Forest Reserve, Perak Darul Ridzuan and Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve,Selangor Darul Ehsan. In both study sites, ten 50m x 20m plots were randomly established within the study area and trees with 10cm DBH (diameter breast height) were inventoried. Sub-sampling of seedlings (1m x 1m) and saplings (3m x3m) were also carried out within the 50m x 20m plot. Forest litter were sampled using 22 one meter square quadrate in 50m x 20m plot. Sub-sampling of downed woody material was also done within the plot. Their length, diameter and height were recorded. Decayed downed woody material were categorised according to three states of decomposition. Samples were taken, dried; weight and density were calculated as dry mass divided by fresh volume. In Bubu Forest Reserve, 14 trees were selected and felled and biomass of each component was weighed separately (main stem, branches, twigs, leaves) and discs from three sections (base, middle, top) of the main stem were obtained for further testing. After being weighted at the site, all samples were brought to the laboratory for further analysis. Samples were analysed using CNS 2000 Elemental Analyser for C content. From the analysis,two allometric equations was formulate for two different group based on the wood density from tree sampled which is high wood density class (AGB = 0.05633DBH 2.75756) and medium wood density class (AGB = 0.00023DBH 3.75745). From this information, it was determined that the Bubu Forest Reserve aboveground biomass was 501.30 t ha-1 while Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve aboveground biomass was 420.08 t ha-1. The result also showed that tree component stored 98% of the aboveground biomass, followed by downed woody (0.96%), forest litter 0.76%)and palm (0.28%). The carbon content for all biomass components ranged from 45% to 47%. From these results, the carbon stock for Bubu Forest Reserve was estimated to be 225 t C ha-1 while for Ayer Hitam Forest Reserve, it was 189.18 t C ha-1. The biomass equation develops for this study can be used to assess aboveground biomass in the forest specially in areas where tree cutting is not allowed.

Also widespread is the increasing scrutiny of the practice. How \u201creal\u201d are the offsets? How are they quantified and verified, and by whom?\n Purchasing carbon offsets, or carbon credits, is an option when a company\u2019s efforts to eliminate its carbon emissions through mitigation methods fall short.\n The offsets are purchased through investments in projects that remove carbon from the atmosphere such as nature-based solutions (e.g., REDD, or reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation), negative-emission technologies (including carbon capture and storage [CCS] and bioenergy with CCS), and renewable energy.\n Here\u2019s where the criticism arises: How is the amount of carbon captured by these projects measured? For example, how much carbon can a tree or forest handle? Are all trees equal in their carbon intake?\n The uncertainty and variability in carbon-accumulation rates is acknowledged in research studies that are attempting to provide quantification. A study published in Nature compiled more than 13,000 georeferenced measurements to determine the rates for the first 30 years of natural forest regrowth. A map showed more than 100-fold variation in rates across the globe and indicated that default rates from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change may underestimate the rates by 32% on average and do not capture eightfold variation within ecozones. On the other hand, the study concluded that the maximum mitigation potential from natural forest regrowth is 11% lower than previously reported because of the use of overly high rates for locations of potential new forest.\n While the study was not intended to provide verification to be used in the carbon-offset market, it points to the difficulty in getting the numbers right.\n Third-party verifiers are casting light on the validity of offsets. Various organizations such as the Climate Registry and the American Carbon Registry (ACR) aim to set standards and best practices. In both the regulated and voluntary carbon markets, ACR says it \u201coversees the registration and verification of carbon-offset projects following approved carbon accounting methodologies or protocols and issues offsets on a transparent registry system.\u201d\n In July, CarbonPlan, a nonprofit that analyzes climate solutions based on the best available science and data, rated BCarbon, a standard created by Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy, as one of the best publicly available protocols for soil carbon offsets in the US.\n BCarbon, a nature-based mitigation system, aims to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it in soil as organic carbon. Based on independent verification and certification requirements, the credits under the system are issued for the removal of CO2 by photosynthesis and storage as carbon in soil. Landowners are eligible for storage payments. The Baker Institute said the approach could unlock the potential for removal, storage, and certification of upwards of 1 billion tons of CO2 and lead to the protection and restoration of hundreds of millions of acres of grassland.\n Scrutiny of carbon offsets is beneficial in this expanding carbon market. Verification and certification will serve to increase the trust of both buyers and sellers\u2014and the public\u2014in what will likely be a bridge toward longer-term solutions to reduce global carbon emissions.

Yet it is increasingly difficult and costly to meet these goals by ever tighter regulations on tailpipe emissions of internal combustion engine cars. Moreover, concerns about climate change may lead to substantial constraints on emissions of greenhouse gases. It is wholly impractical to capture from tailpipes the principal greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, which is created when hydrocarbon fuel is burned in an internal combustion engine car. But the fuel cell, an energy conversion device that is a candidate to replace the internal combustion engine in cars, and hydrogen, the energy carrier that will ultimately replace hydrocarbon fuel in fuel cell vehicles, can effectively address both of these seemingly intractable challenges. Together, they can provide the next generation of automotive propulsion cleanly and with low life-cycle emissions of greenhouse gases - and perhaps at competitive cost. Fuel Cell Technology Fuel cells convert fuel energy directly into electricity without first burning the fuel to produce heat. All practical fuel cells are fueled by hydrogen. The fuel delivered to a fuel cell is either hydrogen or an energy carrier such as gasoline or methanol that is converted at the point of use into a hydrogen-rich gas that the fuel cell can use. In some respects the fuel cell is similar to an internal combustion engine and in other respects it is like a storage battery. The internal combustion engine takes in reactants from outside the engine - fuel from the fuel tank and air from the atmosphere - and combines them in combustion. The resulting hot, high-pressure, combustion-product gases push pistons that turn the engine crankshaft. Batteries, by contrast, store their reactants within the battery enclosure where they are converted directly into electricity without combustion, but the supply of reactants is limited by the restricted storage capacity of the battery enclosure. The fuel cell combines the best features of both. Like the battery, it produces electricity directly from the reactants - the fuel and oxidizer - but like the internal combustion engine, it converts the energy stored in a separate fuel tank and is able to continue producing electricity as long as sufficient oxidizer and fuel are supplied to it. The main features of the fuel cell system are a fuel supply, an oxidant - typically oxygen from the air - and two electrodes with an ionically conducting but electronically insulating electrolyte sandwiched between them. The electrodes are connected through a load, such as an electric motor, by an external circuit. At the anode, fuel molecules give up electrons to the external circuit and thereby become hydrogen ions; at the cathode, oxygen ions are formed by oxygen molecules from the air plus electrons from the external circuit. The buildup of electrons at the anode compared to the cathode creates a voltage that drives current through the external load. The electrical circuit is completed by the flow of ions through the electrolyte. The net effect of the reactions at the electrodes is that fuel and oxidant combine to form water and, in some types of fuel cells, carbon dioxide also. Fuel Cells Rediscovered Fuel cells were discovered more than a century and a half ago by British lawyer and judge Sir William Grove. While experimenting with electrolysis - using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen - Grove reasoned that the reverse process should also work: that hydrogen and oxygen should combine in such a way as to generate electricity. His reasoning proved correct, and he demonstrated the first fuel cell in 1839. Little research was done on fuel cells for nearly a century. In the 1960s, however, the fuel cell was rediscovered by scientists working in the aerospace industry. \u2026", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "e661b21a6c60f14059aa32b5dd5ff6075999e68d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2603531878", "CorpusId": 132010608}, "title": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and conversion of CO2 to fuel", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "0ea992d3b0b05b00c07177e9b27faf838415cec9", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 49549337}, "title": "4 D nano-tomography of electrochemical energy devices using lab-based X-ray imaging", "abstract": "Electrochemical energy devices offer a variety of alternate means for low-carbon, multi-scale energy conversion and storage.

However, the presence 21 of compartments in oil and gas fields is often confirmed only once well production data are available. 22 As such, though the broad likelihood of compartmentalization in a CCS site can be forecasted, 23 understanding its exact nature may be dependent on injection data. 24", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "7d0be35359ffee242df59445a9934f6e788afd22", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2048735281", "DOI": "10.2514/6.1992-3171", "CorpusId": 97156392}, "title": "High efficiency detonation internal combustion engine (DICE)", "abstract": "Controlled detonation combustion could be used in future internal combustion engines to achieve high cycle eficiency and minimize NOx formation, if conventional design limitations are removed. Such an engine is herein proposed that uses a separate detonation combustion chamber which discharges tangentially into an expansion chamber formed by the piston and cylinder at top dead center. The expansion chamber is designed to efficiently store a portion of the detonation wave's kinetic energy in the form of a vortex, which is subsequently convened into static pressure. The rapid burning followed by leaning through mixing with air in the vortex chamber may reduce the formation of NOx and unburned hydrocarbons as compared to conventional combustion. The thermodynamic aspects of detonation combustion compared to either constant volume or constant pressure combustion yield a significant increase in combustion compression ratio for fuels such as natural gas.

Natural Gas I C Engines Since the U.S. Clean Air Act was introduced [l], there has been strong interest in the cleaner burning and more thermally efficient operation of internal combustion (IC) engines. Alternate fuels, such as methane, are promising to reach such goals. However, current efforts to substitute alternate fuels for conventional liquid fuels in internal combustion engines face many obstacles. They include from problems with storage, distribution, ignition, low fuel efficiency, and emissions. The latter two problems are addressed in this new approach to the IC engine. The amount of work which can be produced inside an internal combustion engine by combustion products depends on their pressure relative to the surroundings. Consequently, the higher the initial stagnation pressure of the combustion products, the higher the power that can be produced during expansion, which increases the efficiency of the engine. The obtainable pressure is not only a function of supercharging and piston compression, but also of the process used to burn the fuel, which dictates the combustion compression ratio (CCR). One important aspect associated with the efficient use of alternative fuels in IC engines is maximizing the CCR. Slow burning fuels are combusted near constant pressure and usually produce a CCR of less than one. Such a process provides combustion products with a minimal potential for doing work. Note, most of our limited fossil fuels are currently burned inefficiently in the so called \"constant pressure burning mode\" including systems such as power plant furnaces, jet engines, and diesel engines. One such fuel, natural gas, is an abundant. inexpensive and desirable alternative fuel for IC engines as it is clean burning with high octane and cetane number and is thus capable of tolerating high piston compression ratio's without knock. Ignition is easy due to the wide ignition limits of natural gadair mixtures. In addition, Iwn-burning of methane produces low carbon monoxide and significantly reduces NOx formation (techniques are also being investigated which", "year": 1992}, {"paperId": "6f2f06105f2094b245b7b00893ae88ea44eb9cc6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3110981341", "DOI": "10.29117/quarfe.2020.0046", "CorpusId": 230644216}, "title": "Fabrication and Testing of Polymeric Membranes for Energy-Efficient Separation of Carbon Dioxide from Flue Gas", "abstract": "One of the major problems the world is facing nowadays is Global Warming. The main ten Green House Gases (GHGs) include water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The most abundant and dominant greenhouse gas is water vapor but concentration of water vapor depends on temperature and other meteorological conditions, and not directly upon human activities. CO2 is the second-most important one and that is why reduction of CO2 emissions is a vital area of research. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a major strategy that can be used to reduce GHGs emission. CCS divides into three methods: pre-combustion capture, oxy-fuel process, and post-combustion capture. Among them, post-combustion capture is the most important one because it offers flexibility and it can be easily added to the operational units. For CO2 capture, various technologies are used which include: absorption, adsorption, cryogenic distillation, and membrane separation. Our research focuses on one of the technologies for post-combustion capture, which is membrane separation. In this research, we fabricated four samples of polymeric membranes with different proportions of the components and then tested them for thermal stability, tensile strength, selectivity and permeability. The membrane can be modified by trying different mixtures of the forming polymers with different percentages. The separated carbon dioxide gas can be used in different applications like fire extinguishers, carbonated beverages or cooling systems. For the future recommendations finding more applications for the use of the separated carbon dioxide gas will benefit the environment and will make this project more successful. The same techniques could be used to fabricate membranes for purifying the methane gas. Further studies must be done to ensure the effectiveness of these membranes when used in the industry.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "66563cb9334b2c0fa65780738a02229fecc54747", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2897069247", "CorpusId": 86468446}, "title": "Spatial-Temporal Densely Connected CNN-LSTM Nets: An Application to CO2 Leakage Detection", "abstract": "In carbon capture and sequestration (also known as carbon capture and storage, or CCS), developing effective monitoring methods is needed to detect and respond to CO2 leakage. CO2 leakage detection methods rely on geophysical observations and monitoring sensor network. However, traditional methods usually require development of site-specific physical models and expert interpretation, and the effectiveness of these methods can be limited to the different application locations, operational scenarios, and conditions. In this paper, we developed a novel data-driven leakage detection method based on densely connected convolutional neural networks. Our method is an end-to-end detection approach, that differs from conventional leakage monitoring methods by directly learning a mapping relationship between seismic data and the CO2 leakage mass. To account for the spatial and temporal characteristics of seismic data, our novel networks architecture combines 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks. To overcome the computational expense of solving optimization problems, we apply a densely-connecting strategy in our network architecture that reduces the number of network parameters. Based on the features generated by our convolutional neural networks, we further incorporate a long short-term memory network to utilize time-sequential information, which further improves the detection accuracy. Finally, we employ our detection method to synthetic seismic datasets generated based on flow simulations of a hypothetical CO2 storage scenario with injection into a partially compartmentalized sandstone storage reservoir.

Some of the best candidates for large scale CO2 storage includes saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. Several laboratory-based studies have been carried out in recent years to find the influence of CO2 on the acoustic properties of reservoir rocks including Lei and Xue (2009), Nakagawa et al. (2013) and Siggins et al. (2010). They show that Gassmann\u2019s prediction of both Pand S-wave velocities during fluid substitution can be proven by experimental results. The success of CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) technique depends, among other thing on, storage capacity and injectivity of CO2 without any leakage to the surface. Indirect geophysical monitoring can provide information about the CO2 behavior including distribution, migration and change in saturation (Kitamura et al., 2014), and estimate the CO2 storage volume in a given reservoir. In this experimental study, we investigate the potential of seismic techniques for monitoring and quantifying saturation changes in the space-time domain for CO2 reservoirs by simulating 1 km deep reservoir with a pore pressure of 10 MPa using three well-known sandstones: Berea, Red Wildmoor and Gres des Vosges. The experiment protocol comprises of mechanical loading phase, succeeded by a CO2 drainage and imbibition phase. The inherent and stress-induced material anisotropy, the effect of pore fluid composition, as well as the dynamic changes during CO2 drainage and imbibition are quantified, mechanically and in terms of rock physical signatures. The experimental laboratory investigations are conducted in a hydrostatic pressure vessel (Fig. 1c) with a confining pressure of 25 MPa. Pressure sensors measure confining pressures and pore pressures, and Linear Variable Differential Transformer (LVDT) mounted directly onto the nitrile sleeve with an array of Pand Swave piezo-ceramic crystals embedded at three different levels across the length in order to measure velocity both in axial and radial directions (Fig. 1d). The pore pressure is controlled using an ISCO TM pump. To avoid dropping in pressure during drainage, we used a GDS pump for maintaining backpressure. Prior to CO2 injection, the samples underwent cyclic hydrostatic loading from 1MPa to 15 MPa for dry, fully CO2 saturated, and fully brine saturated conditions to characterize the mechanical properties. During both drainage and imbibition, we use a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min from 0 pore volume (PV) to 1 PV in 0.2 PV steps and increased the flow rate to 2.5 ml/min from 2 PV to 8 PV in 2 PV steps. Liquid CO2 was injected from top of the sample during drainage while brine was injected from the bottom during imbibition to avoid gravity segregation. During both drainage and imbibition, axial Vs does not change much and this is attributed to non-response nature of Vs during fluid substitution. The axial Vp decreases from 0-1 PV then flattens out during drainage while bottom and middle radial Vp sensors record drastical decrease from 0-1 PV then stabilizes up to 8 PV as compared to top Vp sensor. In the imbibition phase, the axial Vp increases gradually with the greatest increment occurring", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "25f1f07703003ecf6513e6e926e89ec1966b6338", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1864251579", "CorpusId": 140720836}, "title": "Investigating the impact of sub-seabed CO2 storage on marine ecosystems", "abstract": "As the world faces the consequences of rising anthropogenic carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere and ultimately the ocean, a growing arsenal of adaptation and mitigation strategies are being investigated.

The Koval model is analogous to the Buckley-Leverett method and multiplies the heterogeneity index of the system as an input (H-factor) with the fluid-flow (here gravity) induced instability factor, E to obtain the Koval factor KG = HE. This paper only considers the gravity induced instability factor E (H=1). The Koval factor is implemented in a modified fractional flow function that includes a dilution effect when the CO2 moves away from the interface to describe countercurrent gravity flow. The pseudo two-phase flow problem provides the average concentration of CO2 in the brine as a function of distance. The KG-factor can be used in commercial simulators to account for the density-driven natural convection, which cannot be currently captured because the grid cells are typically orders of magnitude larger than the wavelength of the initial fingers. Such natural convection effects occur in storage of greenhouse gases in aquifers and EOR processes using carbon dioxide or other solvents. A comparison of the analytical model with the horizontally-averaged concentrations obtained from 2-D numerical simulations provides a correlation for calculation of the KG-factor for different Rayleigh numbers. The model shows a rarefaction followed by shock-like behavior because the CO2 concentration decreases away from the gaseous CO2-liquid interface. The agreement between the analytical model and full numerical simulation is practically acceptable. We leave the introduction of the heterogeneity factor for future work. Introduction When a denser fluid is placed on top of a lighter one in the gravity field, it can lead to Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities (Taylor, 1950). This phenomenon is of importance for many fields of science and engineering (e.g. see Sharp, 1984); however, we confine our interest to CO2-brine and CO2-oil systems, relevant for CO2 sequestration and enhanced oil recovery processes. The instabilities initiated by local density increase of brine (or oil), caused by dissolution of CO2, increases the mass-transfer rate of CO2 in brine (or oil) (Ennis-King and Paterson, 2000; Farajzadeh et al, 2007, 2009; Yang and Gu, 2006; Pau et al., 2010; Hassanzadeh et al., 2007; Neufeld et al., 2010; Riaz et al., 2006; Riaz and Tchelepi, 2006). The increase of the mass-transfer rate is equivalent to the dissolution of a larger amount of CO2 in a shorter period of time and faster propagation of CO2 in porous media (aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs). The large volume of dissolved CO2 remains permanently in the liquid (at least as long as the pressure remains unchanged) and poses no threat of leakage, which is favorable for geological storage of CO2. Moreover, one of the challenges in the application of chemically-enhanced oil recovery methods for the naturally fractured reservoirs using solvents is the slow mass transfer between the solvent in the fracture and the crude oil in the matrix. By injecting a solvent that is miscible with oil and increases the density of oil (for instance CO2), natural convection phenomenon could enhance the transfer rates, increase the mixing between the solvent and the oil, and accelerate the oil production. Naturally, the time required for the initiation of the convection and in case of injection of costly solvents the recycling of the solvent play a crucial role in the (economic) success of the proposed method of oil production.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "3bd449a376339c559d1eeaafc7ca5a798df2e4ff", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2995393997", "CorpusId": 213643194}, "title": "Methane production through a solid oxide electrolyser with primary renewable source and carbon dioxide capture", "abstract": "Methane production through a solid oxide electrolyser with primary renewable source and carbon dioxide capture Renewable electric energy can be transformed into storable methane via electrolysis andsubsequent methanation. Power to Gas systems appear as a promising technology to ex-ploit the surplus energy from renewable power plants; different gases can be produced(e.g. methane or hydrogen).In this Master Thesis work, two different Power to Gas systems are modelled using Mat-lab Simulink: a Solid Oxide Electrolyser with aCO2-methanator and a Solid OxideCo-Electrolyser with aCO-methanator. This latter component can operate with an in-letH2/CO-ratio equale to 3 or larger. A ratio of 5 is also considered. TheCO2, comingfrom biogas produced in the Waste Water Treatment Plant ofEDAR Riu Secsituated inSabadell (Barcelona), is captured and processed in order to obtain methane. Additionally,according to the Master Thesis\u2019 objectives, a photovoltaic power plant and aCO2stor-age are sized. An averaged power profile produced by a PV plant located in Barcelonais obtained with thePV*SOLprogramme. Therefore, the installation of a P2G systemallows to achieve two positive effects: firstly, theCO2is not released to the atmosphere.Secondly, theCO2is reused to produce methane without getting it, in a more pollutingway, from natural gas or coal.Nowadays not all the technologies analysed in this work are mature.

Furthemore the photovoltaic power plant is sized assuming operativity onlyduring the summer period; the differences with respect to yearly operation are illustratedin terms of required power and storage capacity.According to the results achieved in this work, the optimal Power to Gas system is theco-electrolyser coupled with aCO-methanator with aH2/CO-ratio equal to 3. Consid-ering the worst case of operation, thus during winter, a PV plant of 1.2 MW has to beinstalled to process the entire amount ofCO2available; regarding only summer opera-tion, a smaller plant of 0.8 MW plant is needed. The capacity of the storage, assumingonly summer operation, is also reduced of almost 30% with respect to winterly operation,where 995m3of storage are needed.

In this research, two folds are targeted to investigate the optimum cement replacements then their influential co-effect with external strengthening techniques of RC beams with a total of twenty-two relatively larger specimens. In the first fold, the attempt is made to use such partial cement replacements to reduce embodied carbon emission and hence carbon capture storage costs. For this purpose, thirteen beams with two types of metakaolin MKA, MKB and silica-fume are considered as cement replacements by 8, 12, 15 and 20% by weight. Effects on strength parameters, flexural behavior and ductility are studied and in turn, the optimum cement replacement ratios are determined as such. In the second fold of this investigation, nine specimens with cement replacement by 15% SF and MKA with three different strengthening techniques are considered. External steel plate bonding with end fasteners, near-surface mounted steel rebars and CFRP strips with end U-shaped wrapping are examined. The effects of cement replacement of each case are determined for compressive and tensile strengths. Cracking patterns, failure mechanism, load\u2013deflection besides load\u2013strain relationships and ductility index are investigated for the beam specimens. The research indicated that SF and MK may be used as a cement replacement up to 20% without any adverse effect for environment friendly concrete. The type of MK influences the optimum cement replacement ratio for enhancing the compressive or flexural strength. Size effect is proven to an aspect of consideration for a standardization of the optimum SF or MK replacement for flexure. Unless brittle modes of failure are secured, CFRP strengthening provides the highest ductility with reasonable strength enhancement.

In 2006, the California Legislature required two California agencies, the California Energy Commission and the Department of Conservation, to produce a report recommending how the state could facilitate commercial adoption of geologic sequestration from industrial sources. In 2010, three state agencies, the Energy Commission, Public Utilities Commission, and Air Resources Board, convened the California Carbon Capture and Storage Review Panel to make recommendations on specific policy, institutional, and regulatory changes necessary for California to enable commercial-scale carbon capture and geologic storage projects. Since 2006, several legislative bills have been introduced to establish regulatory authority, liability, and address pore space ownership issues, but none have made it into law. rtheless require widespread adoption of CCUS technologies, according to studies by the California Council on Science and Technology. California contributes 7.5% of the total GHG emissions in the USA, or 1.8% of global GHG emissions. Over half of this currently is from point sources, but that proportion will increase as the state pursues electrification of the transportation sector. Trajectories of future GHG emissions growth suggest mitigation technologies must be implemented at rates on the order of 10-20 million tonnes of GHGs removed per year. The cap-and-trade system recently adopted in California to address the GHG reduction mandates of Assembly Bill 32 would seem to encourage pursuit CCUS technology projects by industrial emitters, but uncertainties preclude developing viable business cases. Uncertainty includes a lack of data on the costs of capture and storage and the lack of cap-and-trade accounting protocols for CCUS technologies. Although these protocols are scheduled to be developed, they will lag the initialization of cap-and-trade in 2012. * Corresponding author.

So as to efficiently manage material and financial losses across the entire stream, accurate accounting and monitoring through fiscal metering of CO2 in CCS transportation pipelines are core and required features for the deployment of CCS technologies. Moreover, these technical requirements are part of the legal compliance schemes and guidelines from various regulatory bodies. This thesis reports experimental studies of two different metering technologies, an Averaging Pitot Tube (APT) and a Coriolis mass flowmeter (CMF), for CO2 flow measurement, together with the design and implementation of a CO2 flow calibration facility. A prototype system for the leak detection of the gas phase of CO2 is also developed. \n \nA review of the methodologies and technologies for the flow measurement and leak detection of CO2 gas is firstly given, followed by the discussion of the main challenges and technical requirements in their applications. Based on this review, two flow metering technologies, APT and CMF, are selected for experimental studies and a calibration platform using both volumetric and direct mass measurement methods for the gas phase of CO2 is also developed. The APT and CMF were calibrated and evaluated in the test facility. Experimental results obtained in this test facility demonstrate that the instruments are capable of accurately metering gaseous CO2 within a measurement uncertainty of \u00b11.5%. Flow characterization of the fluid under wet and mixed components conditions were further assessed with both meters. Under wet CO2 flow, results obtained show that both flow instruments are subject to significant measurement errors. The APT gave an error of up to \u00b125%, for a liquid fraction of 20%, while the error of the CMF was up \u00b16%, for a liquid fraction of 10%. Further investigations show that these errors can, however, be corrected through simple and straightforward algorithms that can be easily incorporated into computing processes in the flowmeters. In binary gaseous mixture tests, the CMF proved to be very reliable in the gas combination processes and likewise in the metering of the CO2 mixture (? \u00b11%), while a higher degree of uncertainty was registered for the APT (? \u00b14%). Overall analyses from investigations confirmed the APT and CMF instruments as promising technologies for CO2 flow measurement and can be further improved for application in actual CCS conditions. In addition, this thesis describes experimental investigations of the leak detection of CO2 gas from a pipeline, with emphasis on full controllability and flexibility of the operational process. An imaging system using passive temperature change detection techniques is designed, implemented and evaluated. The effectiveness of the developed technique is examined on a laboratory-scale flow rig system.

CO2 originates principally from the raw meal calcination stage and conventional fuel (e.g. coal) combustion for the thermal needs of the process. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is among the examined technologies for mitigating CO2 emissions generated in a cement plant. A very competitive technology for CO2 capture from flue gases is Calcium looping (CaL). According to this, CO2 is absorbed by CaO in the first reactor (carbonator), and the produced CaCO3 is regenerated in the second oxy \u2013 fired reactor (calciner). During the calcination, the CO2 is released from the sorbents, purified, compressed and sent to storage. Among the advantages of CaL for CO2 capture in comparison with other technologies that could be employed in the cement industry, is the familiarity with the management (extraction, storage, feeding, etc.) of CaO-bearing materials and the possibility of reusing purge CaO in cement making as it is chemically compatible with the raw meal used in the clinker making process. This study describes the process modeling using ASPEN Plus for the CaL implementation on a typical (no by-pass) precalciner five-stage preheater cement plant as a retrofit option, in order to capture the CO2 produced through the clinker production. A detailed description of the process configuration of the CO2 capture unit and the basic parameters for the clinker production line is presented. An economic evaluation is also performed, estimating the basic cost parameters and the cost for CO2 avoidance. In order to assess the results, the CaL process is compared with the corresponding economic analysis of amine scrubbing technology, which is the alternative option for post-combustion capture.

Commercialization of CCUS requires an efficient transportation method of the captured carbon dioxide (CO2). Previous works have investigated the technological aspects for conventional CO2 transportation by pipelines and ships, along with the risk and security issues. Transportation of CO2 through gas hydrates is extremely attractive alternative as 1m 3 of hydrate may contain 150-180Sm of CO2. However, the industries are hesitant to implement the gas hydrate technology for CO2 transportation as there is a lack of pilot studies proving the applicability. This work aims to make a feasibility study on the gas hydrate-based CO2 transportation. The technical analysis has been performed in terms of CO2 storage capacity, utility costs, CO2 handling method and the costing for loading and offloading carrier. The results have been compared with CO2 transportation through liquefaction method. Calculations have shown that for a 1m3 ship capacity, 867.97 moles of CO2 can be transported as hydrates, and about 24,553.73 mols of CO2 can be transported in liquefied state. Thus, in terms of volume it is considered not feasible to transport CO2 as hydrates. However, comparing other factors, it is found that CO2 hydrates-based transportation is a better option than liquefaction for sources with lower emissions as involved CAPEX and OPEX is lower as compared to liquefying the similar amount of CO2.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "0a9e7c188141d6535e2d037ee325d9f294ce1964", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3190383861", "DOI": "10.46557/001c.25729", "CorpusId": 238782334}, "title": "Comparative Study on the Developmental Stages of Global CCS Technology Based on the S-Curve Model", "abstract": "This article uses the S-curve model to empirically explore global carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology development stages and conduct a comparative analysis for various countries.

The motivations originally stem from primary cementing of oil and gas wells, as well as other types of wells such as those in Carbon Capture and Storage applications. During primary cementing, cement slurries are placed in an annular region between a steel casing and a wellbore to provide mechanical stability and hydraulic isolation. Several complications may arise due to the eccentricity of the annular region, as well as the viscoplastic nature of the fluids involved. The existing 2D and 3D models of primary cementing assume the flow is laminar, while in practice, turbulent and more importantly, mixed flow regimes are common. In this thesis, we fill this gap in knowledge. More specifically, we expand the laminar model of Bittleston et al. [24] and develop a new formulation that includes turbulent and mixed flow regimes. This new formulation considers scaling based on the disparity of length-scales, which allows a narrow-gap averaging approach to be effective. With respect to the momentum equations, the leading-order equations correspond to a turbulent shear flow in the direction of the modified pressure gradient. With respect to the mass transport equations that model the miscible displacement, to leading-order turbulence effectively mixes the fluids. Changes in concentrations within the annular gap arise due to the combined effects of advection with the mean flow, anisotropic Taylor dispersion (along the streamlines) and turbulent diffusivity.

Efforts during the second performance period fall into four areas: evaluation of sources and carbon sequestration sinks; development of GIS-based reporting framework; designing an integrated suite of monitoring, measuring, and verification technologies; and initiating a comprehensive education and outreach program. At the first two Partnership meetings the groundwork was put in place to provide an assessment of capture and storage capabilities for CO{sub 2} utilizing the resources found in the Partnership region (both geological and terrestrial sinks), that would complement the ongoing DOE research. The region has a diverse array of geological formations that could provide storage options for carbon in one or more of its three states. Likewise, initial estimates of terrestrial sinks indicate a vast potential for increasing and maintaining soil C on forested, agricultural, and reclaimed lands. Both options include the potential for offsetting economic benefits to industry and society. Steps have been taken to assure that the GIS-based framework is consistent among types of sinks within the Big Sky Partnership area and with the efforts of other western DOE partnerships. Efforts are also being made to find funding to include Wyoming in the coverage areas for both geological and terrestrial sinks and sources. The Partnership recognizes the critical importance of measurement, monitoring, and verification technologies to support not only carbon trading but all policies and programs that DOE and other agencies may want to pursue in support of GHG mitigation. The efforts begun in developing and implementing MMV technologies for geological sequestration reflect this concern. Research is also underway to identify and validate best management practices for soil C in the partnership region, and to design a risk/cost effectiveness framework to make comparative assessments of each viable sink, taking into account economic costs, offsetting benefits, scale of sequestration opportunities, spatial and time dimensions, environmental risks, and long term viability. Scientifically sound information on MMV is critical for public acceptance of these technologies. Two key deliverables were completed this quarter--a literature review/database to assess the soil carbon on rangelands, and the draft protocols, contracting options for soil carbon trading. To date, there has been little research on soil carbon on rangelands, and since rangeland constitutes a major land use in the Big Sky region, this is important in achieving a better understanding of terrestrial sinks. The protocols developed for soil carbon trading are unique and provide a key component of the mechanisms that might be used to efficiently sequester GHG and reduce CO{sub 2} concentrations. Progress on other deliverables is noted in the PowerPoint presentations. A series of meetings held during the second quarter have laid the foundations for assessing the issues surrounding the implementation of a market-based setting for soil C credits. These meetings provide a connection to stakeholders in the region and a basis on which to draw for the DOE PEIS hearings. Finally, the education and outreach efforts have resulted in a comprehensive plan and process which serves as a guide for implementing the outreach activities under Phase I.

As an alternative to replace the traditional technology of aqueous amine scrubbing, solid adsorbents looping technology (SALT) has attracted growing attention. Among various solid adsorbent materials, carbon-based materials with unique properties such as wide availability, relatively low cost, highly porous structure ease of regeneration, and stable cyclic performance, have been considered as promising candidates at both low pressure and moderate to high partial pressure. In this PhD research, activated carbon spheres derived from two different precursors, which are phenolic resin and coal-tar pitch, have been prepared and modified with potassium intercalation to improve CO2 capture performance for post combustion carbon capture. The project aims to investigate the factors that affect CO2 adsorption performance for post combustion carbon capture. \nFirstly, series of spherical activated carbon beads (with a uniform diameter of ca. 0.6-0.8 mm) derived from phenolic resin have been developed and characterised. The results show that the surface polarity can be enhanced by potassium intercalation. The intercalation of potassium significantly increased the CO2 capacity of the AC beads by a factor of up to 2 at 0.15 bar while the effects of the treatment on their mechanical strength and morphological features were negligible at KOH/AC mass ratios of 0.3 and below. The factors other than adsorption that affect the performance of phenolic resin derived carbon spheres were also investigated in terms of adsorption kinetics, cyclic performance, heat of adsorption, the effect of moisture, and regeneration heat. \nSecondly, coal tar pitch derived activated carbons, with uniform spherical diameter of 1-2 mm were synthesised via two different activation approaches, which is firstly an initial steam activation followed by KOH activation, and secondly one-step KOH activation, both with mild KOH/carbon mass ratios. Samples prepared with one-step KOH activation method had shown a better microporous structure and a higher CO2 adsorption capacity. Owing to the narrow micropores and K-doping, the samples demonstrated outstanding CO2 capacities at relatively low CO2 partial pressure. Multicycle stability was examined over 50 cycles of adsorption and desorption, and both samples present excellent adsorption kinetics and regeneration ability. Finally, the volumetric CO2 uptake of best performing samples were also calculated and compared with other candidates. \nBased on our previous results, further investigation towards the influence of precursor materials and correlation between microporosity pore size ranging from 0.4 nm to 2 nm and CO2 uptakes have been carried out.

Herein, for the first time, we propose a route to synthesize low-cost Li4SiO4 as CO2 sorbents from spent LIBs, verify the technical feasibility, and evaluate the CO2 adsorption/desorption performance. The results show that Li4SiO4 synthesized from the cathode with self-reduction by the anode graphite of LIBs has a superior CO2 capacity and cyclic stability, which is constant at around 0.19 g/g under 15 vol % CO2 after 80 cycles. Moreover, the cost of fabricating sorbents from LIBs is only 1/20-1/3 of the conventional methods.

Chemical Engineering", "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) uses a combination of technologies to capture, transport and store carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from large point sources such as coal or natural gas-fired power plants. Capturing CO2 from ambient air has been considered as a carbon-negative technology to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the air. The performance of a mesoporous silica-supported polyethyleneimine (PEI)\u2013silica adsorbent for CO2 capture from ambient air has been evaluated in a laboratory-scale Bubbling Fluidized Bed (BFB) reactor. The air capture tests lasted for between 4 and 14 days using 1 kg of the PEI\u2013silica adsorbent in the BFB reactor. Despite the low CO2 concentration in ambient air, nearly 100% CO2 capture efficiency has been achieved with a relatively short gas\u2013solid contact time of 7.5 s. The equilibrium CO2 adsorption capacity for air capture was found to be as high as 7.3 wt%, which is amongst the highest values reported to date. A conceptual design is completed to evaluate the technological and economic feasibility of using PEI\u2013silica adsorbent to capture CO2 from ambient air at a large scale of capturing 1 Mt-CO2 per year. The proposed novel \u201cPEI-CFB air capture system\u201d mainly comprises a Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) adsorber and a BFB desorber with a CO2 capture capacity of 40 t-CO2/day. Large pressure drop is required to drive the air through the CFB adsorber and also to suspend and circulate the solid adsorbents within the loop, resulting in higher electricity demand than other reported air capture systems. However, the Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) technology adopted for the regeneration strategy in the separate BFB desorber has resulted in much smaller thermal energy requirement. The total energy required is 6.6 GJ/t-CO2 which is comparable to other reference air capture systems. By projecting a future scenario where decarbonization of large point energy sources has been largely implemented by integration of CCS technologies, the operating cost under this scenario is estimated to be $108/t-CO2 captured and $152/t-CO2 avoided with an avoided fraction of 0.71. Further research on the proposed 40 t-CO2/day \u2018PEI-CFB Air Capture System\u2019 is still needed which should include the evaluation of the capital costs and the experimental investigation of air capture using a laboratory-scale CFB system with the PEI\u2013silica adsorbent. & 2014 The Authors.

Whilst there are many options and pathways that could in theory get us to this target, understanding the \u2018best\u2019 approach is something that is open to clarification. A new report by the IEA highlights pathways to the Net Zero target that might be possible through implementation of innovative technology and scale-up. The pathways reflect consideration of a whole range of implementation approaches and highlight the consequences of differing levels of technological innovation and societal behaviour changes. Key Low Carbon Technology options include carbon capture, use and storage; hydrogen and zero carbon fuels for heat and industrial decarbonisation, bioenergy; energy efficiency, electrification and renewables. In this paper, the role research and innovation can play in delivering the NetZero target was assessed by examining two cases from fundamental research into pilot scale in order to accelerate innovation. It is clear that rapid innovation has a key role to play and targeting on technologies that have the greatest potential to slash carbon emissions. The research reported here includes the next generation carbon capture technologies. Rotating packed beds (RPB) could have a significant impact on the capture cost and efficiency of the process. RPBs are a type of process intensification technology that have been proposed as an emerging technology to be used for post combustion capture from the flue gas. This is because of its high mass transfer coefficient and compact structure which will lead to substantial energy and space savings, hence significantly lowering the cost of the CO2 capture. The first case investigated examines the process from fundamental research into large scale testing as a part of the commercialisation. Finally, in the second case, the impact of a breakthrough technology, a supercritical CO2 (sCO2) based energy system is examined and the research challenges are assessed. The sCO2 technology has the potential to produce electricity at a lower cost than conventional fossil fuel generation \u2014 with the inherent carbon capture and zero air emissions.

So far, anyone who was interested in building a basic competence in this field had to look for different textbooks in the various disciplines, since a comprehensive text was missing. The book \u201cCarbon Capture\u201d, which is reviewed in this article, was written by Dr. Jennifer Wilcox of Stanford University and aims to meeting this need. \u201cCarbon Capture\u201d represents a complete reference on both fundamental and applied aspects of this topic. The book deals with different capture processes starting always from the fundamental concepts and from the principles involved. The concepts then rapidly moves to the application of these processes to provide the reader with a useful reference for the basic design and assessment of different unit operations of various carbon capture options. The first chapter of the book provides a general introduction to the topic and to main CO2 sources as well as to carbon capture and storage (CCS). This chapter gives the reader a clear understanding of the scale of the problem of capturing CO2 emissions, the solutions for storing it permanently and the benefits that may be expected from some CO2 utilization options. The concept of energy penalty associated to carbon capture is also well addressed in this chapter. However, the reader may get a bit confused as novel combustion technologies aimed at reducing energy penalty of carbon capture (Chemical looping combustion or Oxy-combustion) are discussed together with the Fischer\u2013Tropsch process, which should be rather considered as a CO2 utilization process. Finally, the very important concept that the minimum energy needed for separating CO2 from any source depends on its concentration is highlighted. The energy penalties associated to CO2 compression, which is needed for transporting it from the capture facility to the storage site, are discussed in the second chapter of the book. This is an issue worthy of being separately discussed in such a book, as it is common practice to include this term in the total energy penalty of carbon capture processes. Specific pipeline transport issues are also addressed at the end of the chapter. The central part of the book (Chapters 3 to 6) presents detailed description of the main separation processes that can be used for CO2 separation from different streams. These chapters discuss the fundamental aspects of the different separation processes and the equations for the design of the different separation units. Although discussed with specific reference to CO2 separation, the concepts developed in this chapter can be useful for any gas phase separation. Namely, Chapter 3 deals with absorption, starting from the fundamental equilibrium equations used to estimate the solubility of CO2 in aqueous solutions. Advanced solvents, such as ionic liquids, are also presented, together with more traditional chemical and physical ones.

Achieving this goal requires understanding where energy is produced and consumed, the magnitude of CO2 generation, and the Carbon Cycle. Many prior proposed solutions focus on reducing future CO2 emissions from continued use of fossil fuels. Examination of these technologies exposes their limitations and shows that none offer a complete solution. For example, bioethanol is shown to be both carbon and energy inefficient. Direct Air Capture technologies are needed to reduce CO2 already in the air. The most natural form of Direct Air Capture involves letting nature do the work of creating biomass via photosynthesis. However, it is necessary to break the Carbon Cycle by permanently sequestering that biomass carbon in \u201clandfills\u201d modified to discourage decomposition to CO2 and methane. Tree leaves and biomass grown on-purpose, such as high yield switchgrass, are proposed as good biomass sources for this purpose. Left unsequestered, leaves decompose with a short Carbon Cycle time constant releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere. While in any given year, leaves represent a small fraction of a tree\u2019s above ground biomass, leaves can represent a substantial fraction of the total biomass generated by a tree when integrated over a tree\u2019s lifetime. Understanding the chemistry of the distinct phases landfills undergo is the key to minimizing or eliminating decomposition. First, the compact cross-linked structure of cellulose and keeping water out will make it difficult for initial depolymerization to release sugars. Air ingress should be minimized to minimize Phase I aerobic decomposition. pH manipulation can discourage acid formation during Phase II. Lignocellulose is low in nutrients needed for anaerobic decomposition. Inhibitors can be added if needed. The goal is to move quickly to the dormant phase where decomposition stops. The cost for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) for growing and sequestering high yield switchgrass is estimated to be lower than CCS for steam reforming of methane hydrogen plants (SRM) and supercritical or combined cycle coal power plants. Thus, sequestration of biomass is a natural, carbon efficient, and low-cost method of Direct Capture. Biomass sequestration can provide CO2 removal on giga tonnes per year scale and can be implemented in the needed timeframe (2030-2050).", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "60c33d86552ed47d91840b7b44bdf4eaa60b14fe", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2524169027", "DOI": "10.21068/C2016V17S02A03", "CorpusId": 210066695}, "title": "Artropofauna epigea del p\u00e1ramo Estambul (Tolima), Colombia", "abstract": "Paramos can store and capture atmospheric carbon dioxide, which make them toolsin the storage and equilibrium of the water cycle and the regulation of the regional climate.

Numerous studies show that large-scale geologic disposal of CO2 from industrial emissions will be essential to achieve this objective. There are currently 21 large-scale CCS facilities in operation. Of these large-scale CCS projects, five use geologic storage in saline formations (Sleipner, Snehvit, Quest, IBDP & Gorgon) and together inject nearly 6 million tonnes CO2 per annum (Mtpa). The remaining large-scale projects mainly use CO2EOR as the storage vehicle. Enhanced oil recovery using carbon dioxide (CO2EOR) can have a dual purpose: (a) To recover additional oil, thereby supplying energy and additional revenues; and (b) to mitigate climate change by reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Historically, CO2EOR projects have tended to maximize oil production as a function of the CO2 injected. There are various options proposed to enhance the climate mitigation effect of CO2EOR projects by maximizing the ratio of the CO2 injected to the oil produced, or by transiting projects from CO2EOR in the initial stages to pure storage projects in the later stages. However, to achieve net zero-emissions, CO2EOR projects need to include a significant fraction of non-EOR CO2 storage. CO2EOR projects also play an important role in building the infrastructure needed for large-scale carbon capture, utilisation, and storage. We illustrate these potential pathways using examples of large CCUS/CCS projects, both from offshore Norway and onshore Canada.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "f5b1b1e4788a52421b965cddcddb68cd4fe5717f",

energy source with the largest geological availability worldwide. Of all non-renewable energies coal and lignite accounting for 55 % of the reserves and some 76 % of the resources represent the largest potential. Reserves are those geological quantities of a mineral which can currently be mined under technically and economically viable conditions. Resources are those quantities which are either proven but currently not economically recoverable or quantities which can still be expected or explored on the basis of geological findings. The global availability of energy source does not only depend on geological and economic factors. The technical availability, e.g. mining and preparation capacities, the sufficient availability of land and sea-borne transportation as well as transloading capacities and also a political availability are required likewise. The latter may be disturbed by domestic-policy disputes like strikes or unrest or by foreign-policy disputes like embargos, trade conflicts or even tensions and wars in the producing regions. In the energy-economic discussion the reach of fossil primary energies plays a central role with the most important questions being: when will which energy source be exhausted, which impact will future developments have on the energy price, what does the situation of the other energies look like and which alternatives are there? The reach of coal can only be estimated because of the large deposits on the one hand and the uncertain future coal use and demand on the other. The stronger growth of population and the economic catching-up process in the developing and threshold countries will result in a shift of the production and demand centres in the global economy. However, also in case of further increases the geological potential will be sufficient to reliably cover the global coal demand for the next 100 years. The conventional mining of seams at great depths or of thin seams reaches its technical and economic limits. However, these otherwise unprofitable coal deposits can be mined economically by means of underground coal gasification, during which coal is converted into a gaseous product in the deposit. The synthesis gas can be used for electricity generation, as chemical base material or for the production of petrol. This increases the usability of coal resources tremendously. At present the CCS technologies (carbon capture and storage) are a much discussed alternative to other CO2 abatement techniques like efficiency impovements. The capture and subsequent storage of CO2 in the deposits created by the actual underground gasification process seem to be technically feasible.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "c2722c4ccb47fd9094fb5e6327d0957553147659", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2009071240", "DOI": "10.1179/174892308X12525027016944", "CorpusId": 135504960}, "title": "Meeting the challenge of carbon capture: is CO2 capture a real problem in IGCC plants and are some issues being neglected?", "abstract": "I have only recently been able to read the article in Energy Materials that summarised the meeting last year at Loughborough on \u2018Energy materials: meeting the challenge\u2019.1 Having recently fi nished working at the European Commission\u2019s Institute of Energy in The Netherlands on an IGCC (integrated gasifi cation with combined cycle) type gasifi cation system to produce hydrogen from coal, and capture CO2, I was taken aback at what it appeared was being said about IGCC. Perhaps this was a result of the need to compress a lot information into a relatively small space, but after outlining pre-combustion processes, by which coal gasifi cation can be used to produce CO2 and hydrogen, the text continues: \u2018However, the [energy] penalty is signifi cant: a plant that was 20% effi cient would use all of its energy to capture carbon.\u2019 (emphasis added). This may be a general comment on all carbon capture plants, but a casual reading (by a Government Minister or an adviser?) could suggest that typical effi ciencies of IGCC, without carbon capture, are around 20%.The correct interpretation is that if one starts with any type of non-carbon capture plant that has an effi ciency of around 20%, the amount of CO2 that will be produced per megawatt hour is so high that all the energy in the plant will be needed simply to capture the CO2 and pump it up to pipeline pressure. In practice, no modern plant has an effi ciency as low as this. Even the old generating plant at Battersea (London) ran at 28%, and that was in the 1930s. More modern units are in the 43\u201346% range, depending on how advanced are the steam conditions However, the conjunction of these two passages of text could be taken to imply that pre-combustion processes are struggling. In addition, the whole tenor of the section on carbon capture and storage suggests that all these processes, whether based on conventional steam plant, oxyfuel, or IGCC, have problems in capturing carbon dioxide. Whatever can be stated about the potential challenges of capturing carbon dioxide from steam plant, oxyfuel or combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs), it can be said with absolute certainty that CO2 removal is not a problem when using gasifi cation as an intermediate step to producing electricity. I can affi rm this from personal experience. Although I graduated as a metallurgist, my fi rst real job after leaving university was to run a steam reforming plant. Such processes, which used naphtha (basically unrefi ned petrol) to produce a hydrogen rich gas, were rapidly replacing the old fashioned gasworks of the time. They were cheap and simple to operate, even by metallurgists! Figure 1 shows the type of plant used by British Gas at that time. A critical aspect in steam reforming was removal of CO2 to improve the calorifi c value of the gas sent to consumers. Carbon dioxide was absorbed using potassium carbonate solution and released to atmosphere, along with some steam. If there had been the need there would have been absolutely no problem in compressing the CO2. Indeed for many years there have been coal and heavy oil plants, around the world, producing hydrogen for ammonia production, or hydrocracking, all of which have to remove the carbon dioxide to obtain the required hydrogen purity. The plant which I helped to run had a thermal output of about 200 MW, and would be regarded as minute compared modern units of the ammonia synthesis type. So the statement that there are problems in capturing CO2 in a pre-combustion process cannot be allowed to stand. 1 CO2 removal section of a steam reforming plant at Plymouth Gasworks in 1968: the tall towers are stripper columns for removing CO2 from the K2CO3 absorbent", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "c56b238a73e4678ff0a8b9b710f5a44cdf5cd688", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2528245788", "CorpusId": 73613535}, "title": "Carbon Finance \u2013 A Platform for Development of Sustainable Business in Kuwait", "abstract": "Since 1880, the temperature of global has increased by 0.85 degree Celsius. Due to the increase in temperature, the impact of climate change is constantly increasing, which is known as global warming. The increase in temperature is due to emission of greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide is a major greenhouse gas, which is capable of causing serious hazardous influence to the environment. Carbon emission reduction and low-carbon economy development have become global targets and national policy in both developing and developed countries. Carbon finance is a tool for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using a process called capture and storage (CCS). Using this process, the carbon dioxide is captured and stored for further usage as a renewable resource. Carbon finance has a high impact on the growth of sustainable business development. This research analyzes the various possibilities of developing sustainable business through carbon trading in Kuwait and the strategic options offered by both government, as well as private sectors for carbon trading in Kuwait. The central focus of research is to discover the role of carbon finance in developing sustainable business and environmental quality. Since no previous research is conducted on the specific role of carbon finance in developing a sustainable business preferably in Kuwait, the influence of carbon financing in sustainable business development and environmental quality are analyzed in this research.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "fa6655f7167b3631e37ab6a507f17512d1dec80e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1919112075", "CorpusId": 94702943}, "title": "SiO\u2082\ub098\ub178\uc720\uccb4\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c CO\u2082\ud761\uc218/\uc7ac\uc0dd \uc131\ub2a5 \ud3c9\uac00", "abstract": "According to the worldwide concerns on the environmental problems, the reduction of CO\u2082 emission has been widely paid attain.

With the increasing electricity production from wind and PV, short and long-term energy storage is becoming one of the main challenges of the 21st century. While batteries are the preferred method for short term storage, a different technology is required for seasonal storage. Hydrogen is a valuable energy carrier, owning its high energy density (122 kJ/g). However, compact and safe storage of H2 is challenging. Complex hydrides are especially attractive for solid-state H2 storage due to their high gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density. Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) contains more than 10 mass% of H2, but high temperatures are needed to release the H2 (505\u00b0C). The work presented in this thesis focused on the combination of borohydride and ionic liquid (IL) cations, in order to modify the stability of borohydride. The materials developed in this thesis are able to release H2 at moderate temperature (< 100\u00b0C), thanks to the charge transfer between the IL cation and borohydride, making them interesting candidates for solid-state H2 storage. In addition, I will present the unique reactivity of these IL borohydrides with CO2. Due to the destabilization of the B-H bond, direct CO2 capture and reduction can be achieved under ambient conditions. Up to three CO2 molecules are fixed per borohydride anion, even at low CO2 concentrations. The obtained reaction product can be easily transform to formic acid (HCOOH), or used as formylation agent in organic synthesis. These results represent a promising path for CO2 capture and valorisation.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "d64128e24baec363f3c68d56c865ebcc65324bed", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2997301867", "CorpusId": 217929281}, "title": "Growth and activity of reservoir microorganisms under carbon capture and storage conditions", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "0b7bd0aa5cb695af703fdaa92e5f4a41db84e276", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2501254582", "DOI": "10.9774/GLEAF.9781783530854_12", "CorpusId": 168627605}, "title": "Intellectual property and business enablers for transfer of carbon capture and storage technologies in Asia", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}]}
