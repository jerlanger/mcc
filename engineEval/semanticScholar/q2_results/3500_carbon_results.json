The small scale Carbon Capture and Sequestration demonstration project in Ordos Basin, China, operated by the Shenhua Group, is the only one of its kind in Asia, to put the multilayer injection technology into practice. This paper aims at studying the influence of temperature, injection rate and horizontal boundary effects on CO2 plume transport in saline formation layers at different depths and thicknesses, focusing on the variations in CO2 gas saturation and mass fraction of dissolved CO2 in the formation of brine in the plume\u2019s radial three-dimensional field around the injection point, and interlayer communication between the aquifer and its confining beds of relatively lower permeability. The study uses the ECO2N module of TOUGH2 to simulate flow and pressure configurations in response to small-scale CO2 injection into multilayer saline aquifers. The modelling domain involves a complex multilayer reservoir\u2013caprock system, comprising of a sequence of sandstone aquifers and sealing units of mudstone and siltstone layers extending from the Permian Shanxi to the Upper Triassic Liujiagou formation systems in the Ordos Basin. Simulation results indicate that CO2 injected for storage into deep saline aquifers cause a significant pressure perturbation in the geological system that may require a long duration in the post-injection period to establish new pressure equilibrium. The multilayer simultaneous injection scheme exhibits mutual interference with the intervening sealing layers, especially when the injection layers are very close to each other and the corresponding sealing layers are thin. The study further reveals that injection rate and temperature are the most significant factors for determining the lateral and vertical extent that the CO2 plume reaches and which phase and amount will exist at a particular time during and after the injection. In general, a large number of factors may influence the CO2\u2013water fluid flow system considering the complexity in the real geologic sequence and structural configurations. Therefore, optimization of a CO2 injection scheme still requires pursuance of further studies.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "137ba902c6d91dac20ae34f98dc21a3f26c34b5e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2754093530", "CorpusId": 115726682}, "title": "Implementation of BECCS in a polygeneration system : - A techno-economic feasibility study in the district heating network of Stockholm", "abstract": "The combination of Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) can reduce the level of CO2 in the atmosphere.

In this technique part of the flue gas is recirculated and introduced back into the compressor inlet reducing the flue gas flow (to the CCS) and increasing CO2 concentrations. Therefore FGR has a direct impact on the efficiency and size of the CO2 capture plant, with significant impact on the total cost. However, operating a GT under depleted O2 and increased CO2 conditions extends the range of normal combustor experience into a new regime. High pressure combustion tests were performed on a full scale single burner reheat combustor high-pressure test rig. The impact of FGR on NOx and CO emissions is analyzed and discussed in this paper. While NOx emissions are reduced by FGR, CO emissions increase due to decreasing O2 content although the SEV reheat combustor could be operated without problem over a wide range of operating conditions and FGR. A mechanism uncommon for GTs is identified whereby CO emissions increase at very high FGR ratios as stoichiometric conditions are approached. The feasibility to operate Alstom\u2019s reheat engine (GT24/GT26) under FGR conditions up to high FGR ratios is demonstrated. FGR can be seen as continuation of the sequential combustion system which already uses a combustor operating in vitiated air conditions. Particularly promising is the increased flexibility of the sequential combustion system allowing to address the limiting factors for FGR operation (stability and CO emissions) through separated combustion chambers.

Natural carbon cycle process will not be effective in reducing the pollutant content, as the amount and rate of CO2 dissipation raise at a drastic rate.

With the development of technologies every day, the amount of CO2 emission is expected to increase steeply, which necessitates more technologies to sequester CO2 with a target of 50 ppm by 2050. CCS involves the capture of gas at some stage of the industrial process followed by pressurization and transporting it to stable geological sites like saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas fields, deep coal seams where it can be trapped for thousands of years. CO2 sequestration requires multiple fundamental R&D approaches and significant breakthroughs. The purpose of this review is to have an integrated analysis of the carbon sequestration process including the state of the art technologies for CO2 capture, separation, transport, storage, leakage, monitoring, and life cycle analysis. Depending on the source of emission, different techniques and methodologies adopted by the scientific community were analyzed and discussed. A brief description of the best practices and techniques for CO2 capturing like absorption, adsorption, cryogenic, and membranes will be reviewed. A comparative study on the same will be analyzed based on their performance, efficiency, regeneration, adsorption rate, the volume of adsorption, cost, and energy required for regeneration. Some of the prerequisites for sequestering the captured carbon dioxide are safety, environmentally benign, effective, economical, and acceptable to the public. Natural sequestration methods include plantation, soil carbon sequestration, and CH4-CO2 reforming. Industrially acceptable sequestration process involves isolating the captured gas into places which are nonaccessible to living creatures which include basically geologic, oceanic, and terrestrial dumping sites. All the three geoengineering techniques and their subdivisions will be discussed in detail with up to date improvisations and results.

The extensions were developed for the detailed operational investigation of a pipeline for the transport of carbon dioxide from a carbon capture plant to a suitable location for the geological storage of supercritical, dense phase carbon dioxide.

The optimal size for steam turbine-based cogeneration (CHP-ST) technologies without CO2 capture lies in the range 98-106 MWe (COE is 5.7 USD/MWh) when fueled by forest/logging residues, but the optimal size increases to 200-227 MWe for integrated gasification combined cycle based cogeneration (CHP-IGCC) (COE is 16.73 USD/MWh). The optimal size increases considerably to 249-288 MWe (COE 15.70 USD/MWh) for Salix fueled CHP-ST technology without CO2 capture and 441-504 MWe (COE 27.52 USD/MWh) for CHP-IGCC technology. With the additional feature of CO2 capture, transport, and storage (here we assume 100 km CO2 transport distance from the plant site) the unit capital cost for CHP-ST and CHP-IGCC technology increases around 70 and 30 percent, respectively. \n \nIf one considers revenues from trading emission quotas earned through negative emissions one can estimate a market price of CO2 (PC) at which the COE becomes negative (i.e. all capital and operating costs are covered by revenues from heat and negative emissions delivered). Scale effects significantly influence the economic feasibility of CO2 capture. According to the model calculation, the PC at which the COE becomes negative significantly drops from 75 USD/tCO2 for 10 MWe CHP-ST plants to 32 USD/tCO2 for 90 MWe CHP-ST plants when fueled by Salix. The PC drop from 65 USD/tCO2 for 10 MWe CHP-ST plants to 25 USD/tCO2 for 90 MWe CHP-ST plants when fueled by forest/logging residues. For CHP-IGCC plants, the PC decreases from 72.5 USD/tCO2 for 30 MWe to 37.5 USD/tCO2 for 170 MWe when fueled by Salix. When fueled by forest/logging residue, the PC decreases from 62.5 USD/tCO2 for 30 MWe plants to 30 USD/tCO2 for 170 MWe. \n \nThe techno-economic assessment was based on electrical capacity of the plants and revenues from cogenerated heat and captured CO2 were credited. In practice, the implementation of any cogeneration should be optimized based on site-specific context.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "5943cb4aea95dedf12f54782d0622ff7c711c9f2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1981023198", "DOI": "10.1093/treephys/tpu058", "CorpusId": 18326064, "PubMed": "25056092"}, "title": "Root length, biomass, tissue chemistry and mycorrhizal colonization following 14 years of CO2 enrichment and 6 years of N fertilization in a warm temperate forest.", "abstract": "Root systems serve important roles in carbon (C) storage and resource acquisition required for the increased photosynthesis expected in CO2-enriched atmospheres.

CO2 fumigation led to greater root length (98%) in unfertilized plots, but root biomass increases under elevated CO2 were only found for roots <1\u2005mm in diameter in unfertilized plots (59%). Neither fine root [C] nor [N] was significantly affected by increased CO2. There was significantly less root biomass in N-fertilized plots (19%), but fine root [N] and [C] both increased under N fertilization (29 and 2%, respectively). Mycorrhizal root tip biomass responded positively to CO2 fumigation in unfertilized plots, but was unaffected by CO2 under N fertilization. Changes in fine root [N] and [C] call for further study of the effects of N fertilization on fine root function. Here, we show that the stimulation of pine roots by elevated CO2 persisted after 14 years of fumigation, and that trees did not rely exclusively on increased mycorrhizal associations to acquire greater amounts of required N in CO2-enriched plots. Stimulation of root systems by CO2 enrichment was seen primarily for fine root length rather than biomass. This observation indicates that studies measuring only biomass might overlook shifts in root systems that better reflect treatment effects on the potential for soil resource uptake.

Saline reservoirs are attractive geological sites for CO2 sequestration because of their huge capacity for sequestration. Over the last decade, numerical simulation codes have been developed in U.S, Europe and Japan to determine a priori the CO2 storage capacity of a saline aquifer and provide risk assessment with reasonable confidence before the actual deployment of CO2 sequestration can proceed with enormous investment. In U.S, TOUGH2 numerical simulator has been widely used for this purpose. However at present it does not have the capability to determine optimal parameters such as injection rate, injection pressure, injection depth for vertical and horizontal wells etc. for optimization of the CO2 storage capacity and for minimizing the leakage potential by confining the plume migration. This paper describes the development of a \u201cGenetic Algorithm (GA)\u201d based optimizer for TOUGH2 that can be used by the industry with good confidence to optimize the CO2 storage capacity in a saline aquifer of interest. This new code including the TOUGH2 and the GA optimizer is designated as \u201cGATOUGH2\u201d. It has been validated by conducting simulations of three widely used benchmark problems by the CCS researchers worldwide: (a) Study of CO2 plume evolution and leakage through an abandoned well, (b) Study of enhanced CH4 recovery in combination with CO2 storage in depleted gas reservoirs, and (c) Study of CO2 injection into a heterogeneous geological formation. Our results of these simulations are in excellent agreement with those of other researchers obtained with different codes. The validated code has been employed to optimize the proposed water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection scheme for (a) a vertical CO2 injection well and (b) a horizontal CO2 injection well, for optimizing the CO2 sequestration capacity of an aquifer. These optimized calculations are compared with the brute force nearly optimized results obtained by performing a large number of calculations. These comparisons demonstrate the significant efficiency and accuracy of GATOUGH2 as an optimizer for TOUGH2. This capability holds a great promise in studying a host of other problems in CO2 sequestration such as how to optimally accelerate the capillary trapping, accelerate the dissolution of CO2 in water or brine, and immobilize the CO2 plume.Copyright \u00a9 2012 by ASME", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "e119a64f09bf20b7078b9336c501746ceb7a6f60", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2945732895", "DOI": "10.1029/2019GL083362", "CorpusId": 181986536}, "title": "Using Heat as a Predictor of CO2 Breakthrough in Highly Heterogeneous Reservoirs", "abstract": "Injecting supercritical CO2 into the subsurface changes the temperature, pressure, and geochemistry of the storage reservoir.

The chemical phenomena are modelled on the basis of a simplified approach, which assumes that pollutant conversion is governed by oxygen storage and release dynamics. The transport phenomena, i.e. heat transfer, gas-phase mass transfer, washcoat diffusion, and pressure drop, are modelled on the basis of correlations adapted from the literature. The model is validated using lambda scan tests and a cold-start driving cycle, carried out with a honeycomb catalyst and a ceramic foam catalyst. The experimental data show a decline in methane conversion for lean mixtures, which is modelled by an inhibition term of methane oxidation from nitric oxide. The proposed model may capture the performance of both substrates with sufficient accuracy, both under cold-start and under hot-mode conditions. The model-based comparison of the two substrates shows that the ceramic foam presents inferior carbon monoxide conversion in the extra-urban part of the cycle. Although the gas-phase mass transfer in the ceramic foam is faster than with the honeycomb monolith, diffusion in the washcoat pores is much slower. As a result, the mass-transfer-limited conversion efficiency of the foam is lower. This is primarily attributed to the higher washcoat thickness of the foam sample tested.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "9cefc72111b1930b0359b01f79df130d6d122302", "externalIds": {"MAG": "778542087", "CorpusId": 106773083}, "title": "Selected methods to reduce energy consumption of carbon capture and storage installation in ultra-supercritical power plant", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "d3cc625dfe4a28cc8760e4bd2e5ce5b3a31eaf6e", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fclim.2021.647276", "CorpusId": 232171948}, "title": "BECCS and DACCS as Negative Emission Providers in an Intermittent Electricity System: Why Levelized Cost of Carbon May Be a Misleading Measure for Policy Decisions", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere is likely to be needed to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2\u00b0C and thereby for meeting the Paris Agreement. There is a debate which methods are most suitable and cost-effective for this goal and thus deeper understanding of system effects related to CDR are needed for effective governance of these technologies. Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS) are two CDR methods, that have a direct relation to the electricity system\u2014BECCS via producing it and DACCS via consuming. In this work, we investigate how BECCS and DACCS interact with an intermittent electricity system to achieve net negative emissions in the sector using an energy system model and two regions with different wind and solar resource conditions. The analysis shows that DACCS has a higher levelized cost of carbon (LCOC) than BECCS, implying that it is less costly to capture CO2 using BECCS under the assumptions made in this study. However, due to a high levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) produced by BECCS, the total system cost is lower using DACCS as negative emission provider as it is more flexible and enables cheaper electricity production from wind and solar PV. We also find that the replacement effect outweighs the flexibility effect. Since variations in solar-based systems are more regular and shorter (daily cycles), one could assume that DACCS is better suited for such systems, whereas our results point in the opposite direction showing that DACCS is more competitive in the wind-based systems. The result is sensitive to the price of biomass and to the amount of negative emissions required from the electricity sector.

In particular, when considering far-field regions of storage reservoirs with vanishing pressure gradients, the physics governing the CO2 flow into brine-saturated rocks become dominated by capillary and buoyancy forces.

Then, we compare Monte Carlo sets of invasion percolation simulations with direct observations of plume distribution to evaluate the effects of a heterogeneous capillary pressure field. The observed plume distribution appears to be controlled by a combination of buoyant migration and trapping at capillary barriers under near-hydrostatic pressure conditions.

The research resulted in basin-scale analyses of CO{sub 2} and brine leakage in light of uncertainties in the characteristics of leakage processes, and generated frameworks to monetize the risks of leakage interference with competing subsurface resources. The geographic focus was the Michigan sedimentary basin, for which a 3D topographical model was constructed to represent the hydrostratigraphy. Specifically for Ottawa County, a statistical analysis of the hydraulic properties of underlying sedimentary formations was conducted. For plausible scenarios of injection into the Mt. Simon sandstone, leakage rates were estimated and fluxes into shallow drinking-water aquifers were found to be less than natural analogs of CO{sub 2} fluxes. We developed the Leakage Impact Valuation (LIV) model in which we identified stakeholders and estimated costs associated with leakage events. It was found that costs could be incurred even in the absence of legal action or other subsurface interference because there are substantial costs of finding and fixing the leak and from injection interruption. We developed a model framework called RISCS, which canmore\u00a0\u00bb be used to predict monetized risk of interference with subsurface resources by combining basin-scale leakage predictions with the LIV method. The project has also developed a cost calculator called the Economic and Policy Drivers Module (EPDM), which comprehensively calculates the costs of carbon sequestration and leakage, and can be used to examine major drivers for subsurface leakage liabilities in relation to specific injection scenarios and leakage events. Finally, we examined the competiveness of CCS in the energy market. This analysis, though qualitative, shows that financial incentives, such as a carbon tax, are needed for coal combustion with CCS to gain market share. In another part of the project we studied the role of geochemical reactions in affecting the probability of CO{sub 2} leakage.

In studies of reactive flows in fractured caprocks, we examined the potential for permeability increases, and the extent to which existing reactive transport models would or would not be able to predict it. Using caprock specimens from the Eau Claire and Amherstburg, we found that substantial increases in permeability are possible for caprocks that have significant carbonate content, but minimal alteration is expected otherwise.

A joint U.S. Department of Energy and industry project to study the reservoir mechanisms, field performance and economics of CO2 sequestration in coalseams has been initiated. The project involves laboratory and field-testing to define critical reservoir mechanisms, such as coal matrix expansion and permeability reduction with CO2 injection, multi-component (CO2-CH4-N2 ternary) sorption behavior, and geochemical reactions that could lead to permeability reduction. Two existing fields in the San Juan Basin, the most prolific CBM basin in the world, are currently under CO2 and/or N2 injection. These two fields, the Tiffany Unit \u2013 now under N2 injection but with mixed CO2/ N2 injection planned, and the Allison Unit \u2013 under CO2 injection since 1995, will be thoroughly studied as to CO2 sequestration and enhanced CBM recovery performance, using both pure CO2 and CO2/ N2 mixtures. This paper presents the fundamental reservoir mechanisms of CO2 sequestration in coalseams, the field performances to date of the Tiffany and Allison Units, the advantages of mixed CO2/N2 injection, and some economic considerations for CO2 sequestration in coalseams.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND The concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is rising and, due to growing concern about its effects, the U.S. and 164 other countries ratified the Rio Mandate in 1992, which calls for \u2018...stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.\u2019 Even modest stabilization will require enormous reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions resulting from fossil fuel use; the energy sector is responsible for roughly 90% of U.S. GHG emissions, and 85% of the current U.S. energy system is based on fossil fuels. Under virtually any stabilization and market scenario, fossil fuels will remain the mainstay of energy production for the foreseeable future. To achieve atmospheric stabilization that is deemed acceptable will require large-scale, low-cost sequestration of carbon, a need for which no cost-effective technology exists today. As a result, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) developed its Carbon Sequestration R&D Program Plan: FY1999-FY2000, which addresses the entire carbon sequestration \u2018life cycle\u2019 of capture, separation, transport, and storage or reuse. As a first priority, the sequestration pathways being pursued by the program are those that offer large CO2 storage capacity and comparatively lower costs.

One of the most promising ways of disposing of CO2 is through Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), entailing CO2 capture at source, followed by long-term geological storage. Possible storage sites include depleted oil and gas reservoirs, saline aquifers and unminable coal seams. The former is relevant for countries with an extensive hydrocarbon production and transport infrastructure, such as the Netherlands. However, long-term subsurface storage of CO2 in depleted reservoirs may induce a range of chemical and mechanical processes in response to of disturbances in existing chemical equilibria and in the state of stress within the reservoir-caprock system. Such processes include, but are not limited to, mineralisation reactions, reservoir creep induced by CO2-water-rock interactions, and mechanical failure of and permeability development in the seal formation. While some of these processes, such as mineralisation, may enhance the CO2 storage capacity of a reservoir, others may potentially reduce reservoir and caprock integrity, causing leakage of CO2 to the geological environment and ultimately to the atmosphere. To date, many of these processes are still poorly constrained. The work presented in this thesis focuses on obtaining a fundamental understanding of the effect of CO2 on mineralisation reactions and on time-dependent (i.e. long-term) reservoir compaction or creep phenomena, as well as on caprock stability and permeability development. As the project formed part of the Dutch National Research Program CATO, on CO2 capture, transport and storage, it has been directed at reaction and deformation effects in sandstone and anhydrite, which are the main rock types representing potential host and seal formations for subsurface CO2 storage in the Netherlands. In response to much media attention for the concept of CO2 removal from the atmosphere by (coastal) weathering of imported, sand-grade olivine, the feasibility of this concept has also been assessed.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "f050a468a616ecd8b9c795ae21e66a9ec5eca269", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3007744056", "DOI": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.114675", "CorpusId": 211839154}, "title": "Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage via alkaline thermal Treatment: Production of high purity H2 from wet wheat straw grass with CO2 capture", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "7192ea9887bdab42ac019fbd864c56d1d9fa26d7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1541567510", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.1099949", "CorpusId": 152724147}, "title": "Crossroads at Mmamabula: Will the World Bank Choose the Clean Energy Path?", "abstract": "At the recent UN climate change conference in Bali, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon called for a revolutionary change in the world\u2019s energy mix to minimize the risk of catastrophic global heating. This paper explores the implications for the World Bank and other donor institutions, employing proposed Bank financing of the Mmamabula coal-fired power project in Botswana as an illustrative case. Using the latest estimates of generating costs for coal-fired and low-carbon power options, I compute the CO2 accounting charges that would promote switching to the low-carbon options. In all cases, I find that that the switching charges are at the low end of the range that is compatible with safe atmospheric limits on carbon loading. Among the low-carbon options that I have considered for Botswana, solar thermal power seems to dominate carbon capture and storage. My results suggest that the World Bank and other donor institutions will adopt a transformational energy policy if they use appropriate accounting charges for carbon emissions. The Mmamabula example indicates that this approach will select low-carbon options in many cases, and grants from the Bank\u2019s Clean Technology Fund and other sources can finance the market-cost gap between clean and fossil-fired technologies.

Large amounts of fossil-based, carbon containing reductants are used in blast furnaces, which results in carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Fossil carbon dioxide emissions from steel production can be reduced by new technologies or moving from non-renewable to renewable energy sources. Biomass-based reductants could be one way to reduce the specific emissions from blast furnace-based steel production. The aim of this thesis was to examine the techno-economic and CO2 mitigation potentials of using bioreducers in blast furnace ironmaking. Bioreducer feasibility was analyzed in the Finnish context, but the research methods used can be applied more widely. The metallurgical properties of bioreducers were evaluated and compared to fossil-based reductants. The impact of bioreducers on blast furnace behavior and on other steel plant processes was evaluated, with an emphasis on the reductions achieved in CO2 emissions at the plant scale. The CO2 emissions, energy consumption and production costs of bioreducers were evaluated, as was the availability of energy wood for bioreducer production. The results show that solid, liquid and gaseous bioreducers can be produced with thermochemical conversion technologies. However, their suitability for blast furnace use varies greatly. The highest substitution of fossil-based reductants in a blast furnace is achieved with charcoal injection. The carbon footprint of torrefied wood, charcoal and Bio-SNG is moderate compared to fossil-based reducing agents and their production is energetically feasible. The economic feasibility of bioreducers is currently weak in comparison to fossil-based reducing agents, but competitive when compared to other CO2 emission reduction measures such as carbon capture and storage. The biomass availability assessment revealed that sufficient amount of energy wood could be available for bioreducer production in the areas where Finnish steel plants are situated. The feasibility of bioreducer production could be improved by producing a number of products from the biomass and taking advantage of the process of integration possibilities.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "06dd090b07ca97d91a76af34f7517c92bde8c837", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s11356-020-12049-4", "CorpusId": 230781949, "PubMed": "33405167"}, "title": "A review on ex situ mineral carbonation", "abstract": "The increased CO2 quantities in the environment have led to many harmful effects. Therefore, it is very important to decrease the CO2 levels in the environment. CO2 capture along with safe and permanent storage using mineral CO2 sequestration method can play an important role to reduce carbon emissions into the environment. Mineral sequestration is a stable storage method that provides long-term storage and an appropriate substitute for the more popular geological storage method. The process is most suited for places where there is a lack of underground cavities for underground geological storage. Minerals rich in Ca and Mg are used predominantly in carbonation reactions. In addition, those alkaline wastes that are rich in Mg and Ca such as cement waste, steel slag and many process ashes can also be employed in CO2 sequestration. Mineral carbonation could be used for the sequestration of billions of tonnes of CO2 every year. However, various drawbacks related to mineral carbonation still need to be addressed, such as resolving the slow rate of reactions, necessity of large amounts of feedstock, decreasing the high overall cost of CO2 sequestration and reducing the huge energy requirements to accelerate the carbonation reaction.

Among several CO2 storage options, storing CO2 in saline aquifers is the most promising because of the large storage potential, estimated at from about 2,000 Gt CO2 to more than 10,000 Gt CO2. In this article, we first describe current global trends of CCS technology development and national policies. Some CCS technologies are already in practical use in several countries and are economically viable. Close attention has been paid recently to deep saline aquifer storage, which is expected to have a large storage potential of about 2,000 Gt CO2 throughout the world. We then focus on the mechanisms of deep saline aquifer CO2 storage. In deep saline aquifer storage, chemical reactions in the water-rock-CO2 system play important roles for trapping CO2 in the aquifer formation, as well as physical trapping by overburden impermeable cap rocks and residual gas trapping mechanisms. We also stress the importance of the long-term monitoring of the storage aquifer because CO2 would be trapped stably in the formation for a long time. It is thus important to develop effective monitoring techniques for the behavior of CO2 in the aquifer. Physical as well as chemical monitoring techniques should be used for storage aquifer monitoring. We conclude this article with discussions about storage potential in Japan and some important issues related to deep saline aquifers. Deep saline formations are distributed widely in Japan, and have the potential for the geological storage of 146 Gt of CO2. It is therefore economically feasible to use deep saline formations near large emission sources such as coal-fired power plants and integrated steel works. To realize CCS in Japan, it is important to make further advances in studies on the basic physical and chemical trapping mechanisms of water-rock-CO2 system, and in studies on the geological characteristics of aquifer formations.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "411b6291f50fbf3c7c0204812cd86d41bf36c5c5", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s11367-020-01853-2", "CorpusId": 231670399}, "title": "Carbon footprint of plastic from biomass and recycled feedstock: methodological insights", "abstract": "A circular (bio)economy is sustained through use of secondary raw material and biomass feedstock. In life cycle assessment (LCA), the approach applied to address the impact of these feedstocks is often unclear, in respect to both handling of the recycled content and End-of-Life recyclability and disposal. Further, the modelling approach adopted to account for land use change (LUC) and biogenic C effects is crucial to defining the impact of biobased commodities on global warming. We depart from state-of-the-art approaches proposed in literature and apply them to the case of non-biodegradable plastic products manufactured from alternative feedstock, focusing on selected polymers that can be made entirely from secondary raw material or biomass. We focus on global warming and the differences incurred by recycled content, recyclability, LUC, and carbon dynamics (effects of delayed emission of fossil C and temporary storage of biogenic C). To address the recycled content and recyclability, three formulas recently proposed are compared and discussed. Temporary storage of biogenic C is handled applying methods for dynamic accounting. LUC impacts are addressed by applying and comparing a biophysical, global equilibrium and a normative-based approach. These methods are applied to two case studies (rigid plastic for packaging and automotive applications) involving eight polymers. Drawing upon the results, secondary raw material is the feedstock with the lowest global warming impact overall. The results for biobased polymers, while promising in some cases (polybutylene succinate), are significantly affected by the formulas proposed to handle the recycled content and recyclability. We observe that some of the proposed formulas in their current form do not fully capture the effects associated with the biogenic nature of the material when this undergoes recycling and substitutes fossil materials. Furthermore, the way in which the recycled content is modelled is important for wastes already in-use. LUC factors derived with models providing a combined direct and indirect impact contribute with 15\u201330% of the overall life cycle impact, which in magnitude is comparable to the savings from temporary storage of biogenic C, when included. End-of-Life formulas can be improved by addition of corrective terms accounting for the relative difference in disposal impacts between the recycled and market-substituted product. This affects the assessment of biobased materials. Inclusion of LUCs effects using economic/biophysical models in addition to (direct) LUC already embedded in commercial datasets may result in double-counting and should be done carefully. Dynamic assessment allows for detailed modelling of the carbon cycle, providing useful insights into the impact associated with biogenic C storage.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "1673ac60f2a5457f4af12063061a922c8ce2a3ac", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2755026734", "DOI": "10.1002/2017JG003906", "CorpusId": 134121232}, "title": "Patterns in stream greenhouse gas dynamics from mountains to plains in northcentral Wyoming", "abstract": "Quantification of small stream contributions to global carbon cycling is key to understanding how freshwater systems transmit and transform carbon between terrestrial and atmospheric pools. To date, greenhouse gas emissions of carbon dioxide and methane from freshwaters, particularly in mountainous regions, remain poorly characterized due to a lack of direct field observations. Using a unique longitudinal approach, we conducted field surveys across two ecoregions (Middle Rockies and Great Plains) in the Clear Creek watershed, a subwatershed of Wyoming's Powder River Basin. We took direct measurements of stream gases using headspace sampling at 30 sites (8 June to 23 October). We observed the lowest and most variable concentrations in headwaters, which flow through a federally designated alpine wilderness area. By contrast, the Great Plains exhibited 1.45 and 4 times higher pCO2 and pCH4 concentrations and the relative contributions of methane increased downstream. Fluxes during snowmelt were 45% and 58% higher for CO2 and CH4 than during base flow but overall were lower than estimates for other systems. Variability for pCO2 was highest during late summer and in the uppermost sections of the headwaters. The high heterogeneity and common undersaturation observed through space and time, especially in the mountains, suggest that downscaled regional estimates may fail to capture variability in fluxes observed at these smaller scales.

In the short term, CCS is more expensive than either buying emission rights on the market or reducing emissions within the firm itself. Therefore, the EU provides for substantial subsidies of several billions of euros to installations under the EU ETS that apply CCS. Although it is to be applauded that the EU has avoided several uneconomical alternatives, our analysis shows that these subsidies are inefficient. First, the EU ETS was created to let emitters choose the least-cost option to comply with their emission targets. Policymakers should not undermine this market by picking winners: the CO2 price should and can determine when CCS becomes attractive. Second, we question the design of the CCS subsidies. For instance, emission rights will be taken from the new entrants reserve to fund CCS projects, which creates a barrier to entry, and allowance auction revenues will be given to CCS users, whereas it is more efficient to use that money for reducing distortionary taxes (such as taxes on labour).

This energy is used to support photosynthesis, a process in which carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is incorporated into organic compounds in the plant to allow the plant to grow. Other parts of the plant, such as the stem, flowers, or seeds are also able to conduct photosynthesis to contribute to growth in many plant species. The main contribution of photosynthesis in these parts of the plant may be to use carbon dioxide produced by the plant in respiration rather than from the surrounding atmosphere. The biochemical processes used by the plant in these organs may be different from those used in the leaves of the same plant. This process is enhanced in plants under stress and may be important for plant survival in some situations. Increased knowledge of these processes may be used to develop plant varieties that are more tolerant of environmental extremes and could help adapt agriculture to climate change. Abstract Plants have leaves as specialised organs that capture light energy by photosynthesis. However, photosynthesis is also found in other plant organs. Photosynthesis may be found in the petiole, stems, flowers, fruits, and seeds. All photosynthesis can contribute to the capture of carbon and growth of the plant. The benefit to the plant of photosynthesis in these other tissues or organs may often be associated with the need to re-capture carbon especially in storage organs that have high respiration rates. Some plants that conduct C3 photosynthesis in the leaves have been reported to use C4 photosynthesis in petioles, stems, flowers, fruits, or seeds. These pathways of non-leaf photosynthesis may be especially important in supporting plant growth under stress and may be a key contributor to plant growth and survival.

At the present stage, the optimal reboiler duty can be reduced to 5.3 GJ/ton CO2 by using 23%DETA+10%PZ solution as the absorbent at a solvent flow rate of 100 kg/hr.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "f0015590cc909d3ad74ccc7584c3b1ae343ec611", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2463454524", "CorpusId": 3104457}, "title": "Economic Uncertainty in Subsurface CO2 Storage: Geological Injection Limits and Consequences for Carbon Managment Costs", "abstract": "Storing large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) in saline formations is a potential option to mitigate CO2 emissions from power generating stations from entering the atmosphere.

We compare economy-wide modelling of 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C scenarios with sector-focused analyses of four critical sectors that are difficult to decarbonise: aviation, shipping, road freight transport, and industry. We develop and apply a novel framework to analyse and track mitigation progress in these sectors. We find that emission reductions in the 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C scenarios of the IMAGE model come from deep cuts in CO2 intensities and lower energy intensities, with minimal demand reductions in these sectors\u2019 activity. We identify a range of additional measures and policy levers that are not explicitly captured in modelled scenarios but could contribute significant emission reductions. These are demand reduction options, and include less air travel (aviation), reduced transportation of fossil fuels (shipping), more locally produced goods combined with high load factors (road freight), and a shift to a circular economy (industry). We discuss the challenges of reducing demand both for economy-wide modelling and for policy. Based on our sectoral analysis framework, we suggest modelling improvements and policy recommendations, calling on the relevant UN agencies to start tracking mitigation progress through monitoring key elements of the framework (CO2 intensity, energy efficiency, and demand for sectoral activity, as well as the underlying drivers), as a matter of urgency. Key policy insights Four critical sectors (aviation, shipping, road freight, and industry) cannot cut their CO2 emissions to zero rapidly with technological supply-side options alone. Without large-scale negative emissions, significant demand reductions for those sectors\u2019 activities are needed to meet the 1.5\u20132\u00b0C goal. Policy priorities include affordable alternatives to frequent air travel; smooth connectivity between low-carbon travel modes; speed reductions in shipping and reduced demand for transporting fossil fuels; distributed manufacturing and local storage; and tightening standards for material use and product longevity. The COVID-19 crisis presents a unique opportunity to enact lasting CO2 emissions reductions, through switching from frequent air travel to other transport modes and online interactions. Policies driving significant demand reductions for the critical sectors\u2019 activities would reduce reliance on carbon removal technologies that are unavailable at scale.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "647931e9891427ad3d1cf15f178a58fe0957566e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "616274656", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-4471-6437-1_7", "CorpusId": 92865480}, "title": "Biomass Combustion: Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "This chapter deals with the capture and storage of carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of biomass.

Here we investigate the views of project development consortia employees in five European CCS projects, focusing on their experience of organisational norms and structures relating to engagement. Finding that planning for this engagement has, in several cases, been hampered by a lack of shared internal vision on engagement and communication within the project consortia, at least initially, we draw upon the socio-technical approach to technology embedment and new institutional theory, to observe that internal organisational alignment is crucial in multi-organisational projects when seeking effective public engagement and communication. We observe that this aspect of internal organisation is not yet reflected in the toolkits and guidelines designed to aid engagement in CCS projects.

With a separate dataset collected across Australia, we evaluated how many samples are needed to capture variability within soil cores and the best methods for extrapolating C to 1 m soil depth. We found that 40 core samples are optimal for capturing C variance across 1000's of kilometres but higher density sampling is required across finer scales (100\u2013200 km). Accounting for environmental variation can further decrease required sampling.

A noticeable hysteresis occurred when the flow velocity was initially increased and then decreased, implying multiple (coarse and strong) foam states at the same superficial velocity. A normalized generation function was combined with CMG-STARS foam model to cover full spectrum of foam behavior in the experiments. The new model successfully captures foam generation and hysteresis trends in presented experiments in this study and data from the literature.

A number of indicators have been proposed to reflect comparability of effort and differences in national circumstances; key amongst these are greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (per capita), GDP per capita, as well as GHG mitigation potential. This paper focuses on mitigation potential to provide a comparative assessment between six OECD member economies: Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico and the US. GHG mitigation potential is defined to be the level of GHG emission reductions that could be realised, relative to the projected emission baseline in a given year, for a given carbon price. Data for the selected countries were obtained across the time horizon of 2005-2050 from a total of 19 models, including models that are used to inform climate policy-makers in each of these economies. The paper examines the implications of model structure, and assesses how baseline scenarios vary between the models, before analysing the GHG mitigation potential estimates. GHG mitigation potential is compared for carbon prices of USD 20, 50 and 100/tCO2e. For an assumed carbon price of USD 50/tCO2e, mitigation potential in Japan is estimated to be relatively lower than for the other five economies, ranging from 5-20% emission reduction from baseline in 2020. Although noticeably fewer models report data for Mexico at this price level, the models show deeper potential reductions in the range of 25-37% at the same carbon price. Mitigation potential estimates for Australia, Canada and the US show a wider range of 14-39% reduction relative to 2020 baselines. The EU shows a relatively tighter range of 16-29% emission reductions to 2020.

While the per-hectare carbon capture potential of rangelands is less than either cropland or forests, existing research suggests modest changes in carbon storage on rangelands can potentially alter the global carbon cycle. This paper examines the potential firm-level revenues from voluntary carbon offset programs, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) Rangeland Soil Carbon Offset program. We estimate revenues for short-term voluntary offsets given historical prices and prices projected with potential cap-and-trade legislation. We also estimate revenues assuming 100-yr offsets are required to meet international sequestration standards. Simulation results indicate a relatively wide range of modest revenues from recent CCX contracts and carbon prices. The analysis suggests that recent carbon prices or low-end projected prices from cap-and-trade legislation are not likely to encourage producer participation. Medium and high carbon price projections for cap-and-trade legislation may make carbon sequestration a more attractive option for rangeland managers, but given potential requirements for projects to meet international guidelines for greenhouse gas offset projects, many issues remain before range managers may be interested in carbon sequestration as an enterprise.

CO2 fluids will be transported upwards and then injected and stored in upper nonproductive oil and gas porous rock reservoirs by the removal-transport-injection system (RTIS), assuring also the mechanical safety of the wells. This innovative concept allows the treatment of natural gas in oil and gas wells on fields, through the extraction of carbon dioxide. The natural gas will be free of CO2, the major responsible gas for green house effect and therefore its production will be environmentally friendly.\u00a0 \n \n Key words: Carbone dioxide, carbon capture and storage (CCS), gas wells, completion, removal-transport-injection system (RTIS).", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "627a3a4700e982289bec064aa1c4bbe44ed4c87b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2379553795", "CorpusId": 111480616}, "title": "Statistics and Risk Analysis of Underground Gas Storage Accidents in Salt Caverns", "abstract": "According to the statistics and analysis of previous accidents at gas storage,the paper studied these risk factors to draw lessons from risk assessment methods for gas pipeline as well as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). Three types of main accidents were summarized,and the potential risk factors in the whole gas storage system were classified as 12 main categories and 35 specific risks. Fault tree analysis was used as the risk assessment method to investigate and identify the 13 main risk factors that lead to the main accidents. On this basis,the key engineering models implemented in quantitative risk assessment were described,which included gas hydrate formation model,cavern stability model and gas leakage model. The risk analysis method and engineering models will contribute to quantitative evaluation of main risk factors,and provide scientific foundation for the safe and stable operation of underground gas storages in salt caverns.", "year": 2009}]}
