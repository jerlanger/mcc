However, the future technical potential of BECCS remains uncertain. Two significant deployment barriers that have largely been overlooked by previous studies are the suitability of existing storage sites and the availability of transportation of biomass and/or CO2. This study assesses the near-term deployment potential of BECCS in the United States in the absence of long-distance transportation networks. Considering these constraints, 30% of the projected available 2020 biomass resources can be utilized for BECCS, yielding a negative-emissions potential of 100 Mt CO2\u22c5y\u22121. The analysis further pinpoints areas with colocated resources that could be prioritized for near-term deployment of BECCS. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a negative-emissions technology that may play a crucial role in climate change mitigation. BECCS relies on the capture and sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) following bioenergy production to remove and reliably sequester atmospheric CO2. Previous BECCS deployment assessments have largely overlooked the potential lack of spatial colocation of suitable storage basins and biomass availability, in the absence of long-distance biomass and CO2 transport. These conditions could constrain the near-term technical deployment potential of BECCS due to social and economic barriers that exist for biomass and CO2 transport. This study leverages biomass production data and site-specific injection and storage capacity estimates at high spatial resolution to assess the near-term deployment opportunities for BECCS in the United States. If the total biomass resource available in the United States was mobilized for BECCS, an estimated 370 Mt CO2\u22c5y\u22121 of negative emissions could be supplied in 2020. However, the absence of long-distance biomass and CO2 transport, as well as limitations imposed by unsuitable regional storage and injection capacities, collectively decrease the technical potential of negative emissions to 100 Mt CO2\u22c5y\u22121. Meeting this technical potential may require large-scale deployment of BECCS technology in more than 1,000 counties, as well as widespread deployment of dedicated energy crops. Specifically, the Illinois basin, Gulf region, and western North Dakota have the greatest potential for near-term BECCS deployment. High-resolution spatial assessment as conducted in this study can inform near-term opportunities that minimize social and economic barriers to BECCS deployment.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "f620af01c541e4ea85849339f225afbb5470485d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2086400992", "DOI": "10.1039/C2JM00097K", "CorpusId": 98222215}, "title": "Polycondensation of thiourea into carbon nitride semiconductors as visible light photocatalysts", "abstract": "Converting solar energy into hydrogen gas by water splitting is considered as a long-term solution to address global energy and environmental problems.

This capture technology is, however, energy-intensive and results in large equipment sizes because of the large volumes of the flue gas to be treated. To cope with the demerits of other CCS technologies, the chemical looping combustion (CLC) process has been recently considered as a solution for CO2 separation. It is typically referred to as a technology without energy penalty. Indeed, in CLC the fuel and the combustion air are never mixed and the gases from the oxidation of the fuel (i.e., CO2 and H2O) leave the system as a separate stream and can be separated by condensation of H2O without any loss of energy. The key issue for the CLC process is to find a suitable oxygen carrier, which provides the fuel with the activated oxygen needed for combustion.

In CCS, carbon dioxide (CO2) is captured from fossil fuel-fired power plants or other large point-source emitters, purified, compressed and injected deep underground into subsurface formations at depths of or greater than 800m. At such depths CO2 is in a supercritical (sc) state increasing storage capacity (IPCC 2005). In CCS, there are four main mechanisms which keep the buoyant CO2 underground: 1. Structural/stratigraphic trapping \u2013 here an impermeable caprock prevents the CO2 from flowing upwards, 2. Capillary trapping, where micrometer-sized disconnected CO2 bubbles are formed and held in place by local capillary forces in the rock pore-network, 3. Dissolution trapping, where CO2 dissolves in the formation brine and sinks in the reservoir as the CO2-enriched brine has an increased density, 4. Mineral trapping, where the dissolved CO2 reacts with the formation brine, forms carbonic acid which dissociates generating protons, 3 HCO \u2212 and 3 CO \u2212 ions; these species subsequently react with the formation brine and/or host rock to form solid minerals which trap the CO2 very safely. The focus of this text is on dissolution trapping; how much CO2 dissolves under which geothermal conditions and what happens to the CO2-enriched brine, which is slightly denser than the original formation brine, in the formation. Important open questions in this context are: How fast are these mass transfer processes in real geological porous media under realistic CCS conditions? Are there means of accelerating CO2 dissolution? How do separate gas and/or oil phases (oil and/or gas reservoirs) in the reservoir affect CO2 dissolution processes and reservoir fluid dynamics?

This makes CCS a potentially important bridging technology in the transition to carbon\u2010free energy sources. Injection of CO2 into deep saline aquifers leads to a multicomponent, multiphase flow system, in which geomechanics, geochemistry, and nonisothermal effects may be important.

Here we conduct a comprehensive literature review to present a global synthesis of C content in tissues of live trees. We found a total of 253 species-specific stem wood C content records in 31 studies, and an additional 34 records of species with C content values of other tissues in addition to stem wood.

Conifer species exhibited greater wood C content than angiosperm species (50.8 \u00b1 0.7% (95% C.I.) and 47.7 \u00b1 0.3%, respectively), a trend that was consistent among all biomes.

Hence, a number of mechanisms have been promoted to diminish the atmospheric commutation of carbon dioxide. One of the well-known techniques is Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) which mechanism is based on capture and storage vast quantities of CO2 , as well as Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU) which mechanism is based on CO2 conversion to liquid fuels (e.g. methanol, hydrocarbons, dimethyl carbonate, propylene, dimethyl ether, ethylene, etc.). Particularly, methanol (CH3 OH) is a key feedstock for industrial chemicals, which further can be converted into high molecular alternative liquid fuels. In this regard, hydrogenation of CO2 is one of the promising, effectual and economic techniques for utilization of CO2 emission. Nevertheless, the reduction/activation of CO2 into useful liquid products is a scientifically challenging issue due to the complexities associated with its high stability. Thus, various catalysts have been applied to reduce the activation energy of the hydrogenation process and transform CO2 into value-added products.

The unique field experience at In Salah provides a valuable case study in managing commercial-scale CO2 injections. In particular, the current work highlights the importance of geomechanics and integrated monitoring in understanding field behavior and managing storage risk. Almost 4 million metric tons of CO2 were injected at the In Salah CO2 storage site between 2004 and 2011. Storage integrity at the site is provided by a 950-m-thick caprock that sits above the injection interval. This caprock consists of a number of low-permeability units that work together to limit vertical fluid migration. These are grouped into main caprock units, providing the primary seal, and lower caprock units, providing an additional buffer and some secondary storage capacity. Monitoring observations at the site indirectly suggest that pressure, and probably CO2, have migrated upward into the lower portion of the caprock. Although there are no indications that the overall storage integrity has been compromised, these observations raise interesting questions about the geomechanical behavior of the system. Several hypotheses have been put forward to explain the measured pressure, seismic, and surface deformation behavior. These include fault leakage, flow through preexisting fractures, and the possibility that injection pressures induced hydraulic fractures. This work evaluates these hypotheses in light of the available data. We suggest that the simplest and most likely explanation for the observations is that a portion of the lower caprock was hydrofractured, although interaction with preexisting fractures may have played a significant role.

The perceived potential is based on the premise that the greater efficiency of integrated systems in resource (nutrients, light, and water) capture and utilization than single-species systems will result in greater net C sequestration. Available estimates of C-sequestration potential of agroforestry systems are derived by combining information on the aboveground, time-averaged C stocks and the soil C values; but they are generally not rigorous.

Shrubs are long-neglected life form in the forest ecosystem, playing many roles in the forest and human life. Shrub has great impact on vegetation attributes which in turn modify the C storage and capture. In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the dynamics of shrub species in four fire regimes, viz. high, medium, low, and no fire zones of Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary of Kawardha forest division (Chhattisgarh), India. The variations in structure, diversity, biomass, productivity, and C sequestration potential in all the sites were quantified. The density and basal area of shrub varied from 1250 to 3750 individuals ha\u22121 and 2.79 to 4.92\u00a0m2\u00a0ha\u22121, respectively. The diversity indices showed that the value of Shannon index was highest in medium fire zone (3.77) followed by high, low, and no fire zones as 3.25, 3.12, and 2.32, respectively. The value of Simpson\u2019s index or concentration of dominance (Cd) ranged from 0.08 to 0.20, species richness from 0.56 to 1.58, equitability from 1.41 to 1.44, and beta diversity from 1.50 to 4.20, respectively.

The shrub density, importance value index (IVI), and abundance to frequency ratio (A/F) significantly correlated between high fire and medium fire zone. The basal area was found to be significantly positively correlated between high fire and medium fire, and low and no fire zones, respectively. Two-way cluster analysis reflected various patterns of clustering due to influence of the forest fire which showed that some species have distant clustering while some have smaller cluster.

Currently, the most attractive option for large\u2010scale storage is in deep geological formations, including deep saline aquifers. Many physical and chemical processes can affect the fate of the injected CO2, with the overall mathematical description of the complete system becoming very complex. Our approach to the problem has been to reduce complexity as much as possible, so that we can focus on the few truly important questions about the injected CO2, most of which involve leakage out of the injection formation. Toward this end, we have established a set of simplifying assumptions that allow us to derive simplified models, which can be solved numerically or, for the most simplified cases, analytically. These simplified models allow calculation of solutions to large\u2010scale injection and leakage problems in ways that traditional multicomponent multiphase simulators cannot. Such simplified models provide important tools for system analysis, screening calculations, and overall risk\u2010assessment calculations.

One method of achieving such reductions is CO2 capture and storage (CCS). CCS requires the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) at a large industrial facility, such as a power plant, and its transport to a geological storage site where CO2 is sequestered. If implemented, CCS could allow fossil fuels to be used with little or no CO2emissions until alternative energy sources are more widely deployed. Large volumes of CO2 are most efficiently transported by pipeline and stored either in deep saline aquifers or in oil reservoirs, where CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). This thesis describes a suite of models developed to estimate the project-specific cost of CO2 transport and storage. Engineering-economic models of pipeline CO2 transport, CO2-flood EOR, and aquifer storage were developed for this purpose. The models incorporate a probabilistic analysis capability that is used to quantify the sensitivity of transport and storage cost to variability and uncertainty in the model input parameters. The cost of CO2 pipeline transport is shown to be sensitive to the region of construction, in addition to factors such as the length and design capacity of the pipeline. The cost of CO2 storage in saline aquifers is shown to be most sensitive to factors affecting site characterization cost. For EOR projects, CO2 storage has traditionally been a secondary effect of oil recovery; thus, a levelized cost of CO2 storage cannot be defined. Instead EOR projects were evaluated based on the breakeven price of CO2 (i.e., the price of CO2 at which the project net present value is zero). The breakeven CO2 price is shown to be most sensitive to oil prices, losses of CO2 outside the productive zone of the reservoir, and reservoir pressure. Future research should include collection and aggregation of more specific data characterizing possible sites for aquifer storage and applications of these models to this data. The implications of alternative regulations and requirements for site characterization should also be studied to more fully assess cost impacts.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "52555126ad907d4a9b285d0ed29cc51f45fa2605", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2100702379", "DOI": "10.1002/anie.201402513", "CorpusId": 31857556, "PubMed": "24692047"}, "title": "Room-temperature carbide-derived carbon synthesis by electrochemical etching of MAX phases.", "abstract": "Porous carbons are widely used in energy storage and gas separation applications, but their synthesis always involves high temperatures.

In this paper, we describe the development and application of a ReaxFF reactive force field to describe Li interactions in perfect and defective carbon-based materials using atomistic simulations. We develop force field parameters for Li-C systems using van der Waals-corrected density functional theory (DFT). Grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations of Li intercalation in perfect graphite with this new force field not only give a voltage profile in good agreement with known experimental and DFT results but also capture the in-plane Li ordering and interlayer separations for stage I and II compounds. In defective graphite, the ratio of Li/C (i.e., the capacitance increases and voltage shifts) both in proportion to the concentration of vacancy defects and metallic lithium is observed to explain the lithium plating seen in recent experiments. We also demonstrate the robustness of the force field by simulating model carbon nanostructures (i.e., both 0D and 1D structures) that can be potentially used as battery electrode materials. Whereas a 0D defective onion-like carbon facilitates fast charging/discharging rates by surface Li adsorption, a 1D defect-free carbon nanorod requires a critical density of Li for intercalation to occur at the edges.

However, the potential costs of commercial-scale CO2 storage are not well constrained, stemming from the inherent uncertainty in storage resource estimates coupled with a lack of detailed estimates of the infrastructure needed to access those resources. Storage resource estimates are highly dependent on storage efficiency values or storage coefficients, which are calculated based on ranges of uncertain geological and physical reservoir parameters. If dynamic factors (such as variability in storage efficiencies, pressure interference, and acceptable injection rates over time), reservoir pressure limitations, boundaries on migration of CO2, consideration of closed or semi-closed saline reservoir systems, and other possible constraints on the technically accessible CO2 storage resource (TASR) are accounted for, it is likely that only a fraction of the TASR could be available without incurring significant additional costs. Although storage resource estimates typically assume that any issues with pressure buildup due to CO2 injection will be mitigated by reservoir pressure management, estimates of the costs of CO2 storage generally do not include the costs of active pressure management. Production of saline waters (brines) could be essential to increasing the dynamic storage capacity of most reservoirs, but including the costs of this critical method of reservoir pressure management could increase current estimates of the costs of CO2 storage by two times, or more. Even without considering the implications for reservoir pressure management, geologic uncertainty can significantly impact CO2 storage capacities and costs, and contribute to uncertainty in carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems.

Storage of CO2 at the Sleipner site requires monitoring over large areas, which can successfully be accomplished with time lapse seismic imaging. One of the main goals of CO2 storage monitoring is to be able to estimate the volume of the stored CO2 in the reservoir. This requires a parametrization of the subsurface as exact as possible. Here we use elastic 2D time\u2010domain full waveform inversion in a time lapse manner to obtain a P\u2010wave velocity constrain directly in the depth domain for a base line survey in 1994 and two post\u2010injection surveys in 1999 and 2006.

Among the several services that these areas provide, the capacity of sequestering (capturing and storing) organic carbon is a regulating service, provided mainly by mangroves and seagrasses, that gains importance as alternatives for mitigating global warming become a priority in the international agenda. The objective of this study is to value the services associated with the capture and storage of oceanic carbon, known as Blue Carbon, provided by a new network of marine protected areas in Colombia. We approach the monetary value associated to these services through the simulation of a hypothetical market for oceanic carbon. To do that, we construct a benefit function that considers the capacity of mangroves and seagrasses for capturing and storing blue carbon, and simulate scenarios for the variation of key variables such as the market carbon price, the discount rate, the natural rate of loss of the ecosystems, and the expectations about the post-Kyoto negotiations. The results indicate that the expected benefits associated to carbon capture and storage provided by these ecosystems are substantial but highly dependent on the expectations in terms of the negotiations surrounding the extension of the Kyoto Protocol and the dynamics of the carbon credit\u2019s demand and supply. We also find that the natural loss rate of these ecosystems does not seem to have a significant effect on the annual value of the benefits. This approach constitutes one of the first attempts to value blue carbon as one of the services provided by conservation.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "18bf065a1f85405cd7f9871659ad12203a376adf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1974058936", "DOI": "10.1021/ja206525x", "CorpusId": 20671, "PubMed": "21877735"}, "title": "Strong and reversible binding of carbon dioxide in a green metal-organic framework.", "abstract": "The efficient capture and storage of gaseous CO(2) is a pressing environmental problem. Although porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been shown to be very effective at adsorbing CO(2) selectively by dint of dipole-quadruple interactions and/or ligation to open metal sites, the gas is not usually trapped covalently. Furthermore, the vast majority of these MOFs are fabricated from nonrenewable materials, often in the presence of harmful solvents, most of which are derived from petrochemical sources. Herein we report the highly selective adsorption of CO(2) by CD-MOF-2, a recently described green MOF consisting of the renewable cyclic oligosaccharide \u03b3-cyclodextrin and RbOH, by what is believed to be reversible carbon fixation involving carbonate formation and decomposition at room temperature.

Many methodologies have been used for the isolation of phytoliths from plant material; however, there are wide disparities in the PhytOC contents when determined by different methodologies. In this study we examine the utility of the two main methods used for quantifying PhytOC.MethodsThese methods are: (1) a microwave digestion followed by a Walkley-Black digestion, and (2) H2SO4/H2O2.ResultsMethod (1) produced PhytOC values over 50 times higher than those acquired by method (2). SEM examination indicated that the differences were likely due to shattering of the phytoliths by method (2) allowing consumption by the acid and peroxide of PhytOC .ConclusionThese results indicate that for the samples analysed here: 1] the modified microwave method allowed the total PhytOC to be measured, 2] the H2SO4/H2O2 method allowed the PhytOC within the tightly packed silica matrix to be measured, and 3] the PhytOC retained within the phytolith cavities could possibly be calculated by subtracting 2] from 1]. For the samples analysed here most of the PhytOC resided in the phytolith cavities.", "year": 2013}]}
