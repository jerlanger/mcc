The LCA is made for cradle-to-gate, plus the end-of-life stages of the bamboo products. For end-of-life it is assumed that 90% of the bamboo products are incinerated in an electrical power plant, and 10% will end-up in landfill, which is considered to be a realistic scenario for the Netherlands (NEN 8006) and Western Europe. In addition to the standard LCA (ISO 14040 and 14044), the sequestration (capture and storage) of CO2 has been taken into account. The report provides a comprehensive explanation how such a calculation on carbon sequestration must be made within the general logic of the LCA methodology (and the general logic in science), since there is a lot of confusion regarding this issue. This LCA has been performed for the specific production chain of industrial bamboo products of the company MOSO International BV following best practice and can therefore not be perceived as being typical for the production chain of other industrial bamboo material manufacturers. The overall result of the calculations is that, if production parameters are optimised, industrial bamboo products can have a negative carbon footprint over their full life cycle (from cradle till grave), i.e. the credits through carbon sequestration and energy production in the end-of-life phase in an electrical power plant outweigh the emissions caused by production and transport.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "6e237fedba098e335801776d5c87e18206e1da3b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2738558419", "DOI": "10.1088/1755-1315/76/1/012011", "CorpusId": 133752081}, "title": "CO2 Capture and Storage in Coal Gasification Projects", "abstract": "In response to the global climate change problem, the world community today is in search for an effective means of carbon mitigation. India is a major developing economy and the economic growth is driven by ever-increasing consumption of energy. Coal is the only fossil fuel that is available in abundance in India and contributes to the major share of the total primary energy supply (TPES) in the country. Owing to the large unmet demand for affordable energy, primarily driven by the need for infrastructure development and increasing incomes and aspirations of people, as well as the energy security concerns, India is expected to have continued dependence on coal. Coal is not only the backbone of the electric power generation, but many major industries like cement, iron and steel, bricks, fertilizers also consume large quantities of coal. India has very low carbon emissions (~ 1.5 tCO2 per capita) as compared to the world average (4.7 tCO2 per capita) and the developed world (11.2 tCO2 per capita). Although the aggregate emissions of the country are increasing with the rising population and fossil energy use, India has a very little contribution to the historical GHG accumulation in the atmosphere linked to the climate change problem. However, a large fraction of the Indian society is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change \u2013 due to its geographical location, large dependence on monsoon-based agriculture and limited technical, financial and institutional capacity. Today, India holds a large potential to offer cost-effective carbon mitigation to tackle the climate change problem. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is the process of extraction of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from industrial and energy related sources, transport to storage locations and long-term isolation from the atmosphere. It is a technology that has been developed in recent times and is considered as a bridging technology as we move towards carbon-neutral energy sources in response to the growing concerns about climate change problem. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is being considered as a promising carbon mitigation technology, especially for large point sources such as coal power plants. Gasification of coal helps in better utilization of this resource offering multiple advantages such as pollution prevention, product flexibility (syngas and hydrogen) and higher efficiency (combined cycle). It also enables the capture of CO2 prior to the combustion, from the fuel gas mixture, at relatively lesser cost as compared to the post-combustion CO2 capture. CCS in gasification projects is considered as a promising technology for cost-effective carbon mitigation. Although many projects (power and non-power) have been announced internationally, very few large-scale projects have actually come up. This paper looks at the various aspects of CCS applications in gasification projects, including the technical feasibility and economic viability and discusses an Indian perspective. Impacts of including CCS in gasification projects (e.g. IGCC plants) have been assessed using a simulation tool.

For instance, lower nitrogen fertilizer use reduces both the nitrogen that is leached into waterways and the amount that is volatilized as GHGs. Moreover, agricultural practices and management decisions that slow the rate of nutrient losses to waterways frequently improve carbon sequestration and storage in the soil. Agriculture has an important role to play in climate change mitigation because the sector is a large emitter of nitrous oxide in the United States and also captures and stores carbon from the atmosphere. Thus, a single environmental strategy has the potential to address multiple problems simultaneously. Our analysis shows that the use of market mechanisms like nutrient trading provides not only the greatest overall environmental benefits but also is the most cost-effective strategy. Nutrient trading allows sources with high mitigation costs to obtain credits from sources that can reduce their contribution of pollutants to waterways at a lower cost. Trading focuses on reducing the cause of the environmental concern at hand rather than promoting a specific practice or set of practices.

As fuel and combustion air are never mixed, no gas separation is necessary and, consequently, there is no direct cost or energy penalty for the separation of gases. The most common form of design of chemical-looping combustion systems uses circulating fluidized beds, which is an established and widely spread technology. Experiments were conducted in two different laboratory-scale CLC reactors with continuous fuel feeding and nominal fuel inputs of 300\u00a0Wth and 10\u00a0kWth, respectively. As an oxygen carrier material, ground steel converter slag from the Linz\u2013Donawitz process was used. This material is the second largest flow in an integrated steel mill and it is available in huge quantities, for which there is currently limited demand. Steel converter slag consists mainly of oxides of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), silicon (Si), and manganese (Mn). In the 300\u00a0W unit, chemical-looping combustion experiments were conducted with model fuels syngas (50\u00a0vol% hydrogen (H2) in carbon monoxide (CO)) and methane (CH4) at varied reactor temperature, fuel input, and oxygen-carrier circulation. Further, the ability of the oxygen-carrier material to release oxygen to the gas phase was investigated. In the 10\u00a0kW unit, the fuels used for combustion tests were steam-exploded pellets and wood char. The purpose of these experiments was to study more realistic biomass fuels and to assess the lifetime of the slag when employed as oxygen carrier. In addition, chemical-looping gasification was investigated in the 10\u00a0kW unit using both steam-exploded pellets and regular wood pellets as fuels. In the 300\u00a0W unit, up to 99.9% of syngas conversion was achieved at 280\u00a0kg/MWth and 900\u00a0\u00b0C, while the highest conversion achieved with methane was 60% at 280\u00a0kg/MWth and 950\u00a0\u00b0C. The material\u2019s ability to release oxygen to the gas phase, i.e., CLOU property, was developed during the initial hours with fuel operation and the activated material released 1\u20132\u00a0vol% of O2 into a flow of argon between 850 and 950\u00a0\u00b0C. The material\u2019s initial low density decreased somewhat during CLC operation. In the 10\u00a0kW, CO2 yields of 75\u201382% were achieved with all three fuels tested in CLC conditions, while carbon leakage was very low in most cases, i.e., below 1%. With wood char as fuel, at a fuel input of 1.8 kWth, a CO2 yield of 92% could be achieved. The carbon fraction of C2-species was usually below 2.5% and no C3-species were detected. During chemical-looping gasification investigation a raw gas was produced that contained mostly H2. The oxygen carrier lifetime was estimated to be about 110\u2013170\u00a0h. However, due to its high availability and potentially low cost, this type of slag could be suitable for large-scale operation. The study also includes a discussion on the potential advantages of this technology over other technologies available for Bio-Energy Carbon Capture and Storage, BECCS. Furthermore, the paper calls for the use of adequate policy instruments to foster the development of this kind of technologies, with great potential for cost reduction but presently without commercial application because of lack of incentives.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "4b6b03a9f8b959ed7a1146b53eb220cc8cef9e40", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/eor/CaiS18", "MAG": "2623174919", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ejor.2017.06.009", "CorpusId": 207735696}, "title": "A principal-agent problem with heterogeneous demand distributions for a carbon capture and storage system", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "6fcd39bf4c03495311b2137d69977ffaad4363a9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2268254749", "DOI": "10.3390/EN8031701", "CorpusId": 13168868}, "title": "A Path Forward for Low Carbon Power from Biomass", "abstract": "The two major pathways for energy utilization from biomass are conversion to a liquid fuel ( i.e. , biofuels) or conversion to electricity ( i.e. , biopower).

We analyze the economic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impact of each of these options, with and without CO 2 capture and storage (CCS). Our analysis shows that in the absence of land use change emissions, all biomass co-combustion scenarios result in a decrease in GHG emissions over coal generation alone. The two biggest barriers to biopower are concerns about carbon neutrality of biomass fuels and the high cost compared to today\u2019s electricity prices. This paper recommends two policy actions.

Uniquely, BECCS facilities have the possibility to generate both low carbon power and remove CO2 from the atmosphere, but in an energy system characterised by high penetration of intermittent renewable energy such as wind and solar power plants, the dispatch load factor of such BECCS facilities may be small relative to their capacity. This has the potential to significantly under utilise these assets for their primary purpose of removing CO2 from the atmosphere. In this study, we present a techno-economic environmental evaluation of BECCS plants with a range of operating efficiencies, considering their full- and part-load operation relative to a national-scale annual CO2 removal target. We find that in all cases, a lower capital cost, lower efficiency BECCS plant is superior to a higher cost, higher efficiency facility from both environmental and economic perspectives. We show that it may be preferable to operate the BECCS facility in base-load fashion, constantly removing CO2 from the atmosphere and dispatching electricity on an as-needed basis. We show that the use of this 'spare capacity' to produce hydrogen for, e.g. injection to a natural gas system for the provision of low carbon heating can add to the overall environmental and economic benefit of such a system.

In particular, this study attempts to evaluate the role of mineral carbonation of sedimentary mine waste and their potential reutilization as supplementary cementitious material (SCM). Limestone and gold mine wastes were recovered from mine processing sites for their use as SCM in brick-making and for evaluation of potential carbon sequestration. Dominant minerals in the limestone mine waste were calcite and akermanite (calcium silicate) while the gold mine waste was dominated by illite (iron silicate) and chlorite-serpentine (magnesium silicate). Calcium oxide, CaO and silica, SiO 2 , were the highest composition in the limestone and gold mine waste, respectively, with maximum CO 2 storage of between 7.17 and 61.37%. Greater potential for CO 2 capture was observed for limestone mine waste as due to higher CaO content alongside magnesium oxide. Mineral carbonation of the limestone mine waste was accelerated at smaller particle size of <\u200938\u00a0\u03bcm and at pH 10 as reflected by the greater carbonation efficiency. Reutilization of limestone mine waste as SCM in brick-making exhibited greater compressive strength and lower water absorption compared to the bricks made of gold mine waste.

Mangrove forests, saltmarshes and seagrass meadows, referred to as blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs), are hotspots of atmospheric CO2 storage due to their capacity to sequester carbon at a far higher rate than terrestrial forests. Despite increased effort to understand the mechanisms underpinning blue carbon fluxes, there has been little synthesis of how management activities influence carbon stocks and greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes in BCEs. Here, we present a global meta\u2010analysis of 111 studies that measured how carbon stocks and GHG fluxes in BCEs respond to various coastal management strategies. Research effort has focused mainly on restoration approaches, which resulted in significant increases in blue carbon after 4 years compared to degraded sites, and the potential to reach parity with natural sites after 7\u201317 years. Lesser studied management alternatives, such as sediment manipulation and altered hydrology, showed only increases in biomass and weaker responses for soil carbon stocks and sequestration. The response of GHG emissions to management was complex, with managed sites emitting less than natural reference sites but emitting more compared to degraded sites. Individual GHGs also differed in their responses to management. To date, blue carbon management studies are underrepresented in the southern hemisphere and are usually limited in duration (61% of studies <3 years duration). Our meta\u2010analysis describes the current state of blue carbon management from the available data and highlights recommendations for prioritizing conservation management, extending monitoring time frames of BCE carbon stocks, improving our understanding of GHG fluxes in open coastal systems and redistributing management and research effort into understudied, high\u2010risk areas.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "d468fd1ef11ab2a6eb65726247397952eb901701", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2152537332", "DOI": "10.1109/EEM.2012.6254756", "CorpusId": 29630325}, "title": "European scenario synthesis to be used for electricity transmission network planning", "abstract": "The EU research project IRENE-40 aims at the development of a roadmap for the European and Pan-European transmission networks for the next 40 years (until 2050).

The effect of packing on the storage capacity of the bundles is studied using triangular and square arrays of nanotubes with various separation distance between adjacent nanotubes. The gravimetric storage capacity of the bundles increases with the separation distance between individual nanotubes. At low temperature, the storage capacity of bundles is significantly lower than for isolated SWCNT as the intertube distance is smaller than the adsorbed layer thickness of hydrogen. At high temperature, the adsorbed layer thickness corresponds to only a monolayer of hydrogen around SWCNTs, and hence, hydrogen is captured in the interstitial spaces within the bundle. As the groove volume in the square array is higher than that in the triangular array, the storage capacity of the bundle with square array is higher.

The planetary boundaries framework provides guidelines for defining thresholds in environmental variables. Their transgression is likely to result in a shift in Earth system functioning away from the relatively stable Holocene state. As the climate system is approaching critical thresholds of atmospheric carbon, several climate engineering methods are discussed, aiming at a reduction of atmospheric carbon concentrations to control the Earth's energy balance. Terrestrial carbon dioxide removal\u00a0(tCDR) via afforestation or bioenergy production with carbon capture and storage are part of most climate change mitigation scenarios that limit global warming to less than 2\u202f\u00b0C. We analyse the co-evolutionary interaction of societal interventions via tCDR and the natural dynamics of the Earth's carbon cycle. Applying a conceptual modelling framework, we analyse how the degree of anticipation of the climate problem and the intensity of tCDR efforts with the aim of staying within a \"safe\" level of global warming might influence the state of the Earth system with respect to other carbon-related planetary boundaries. Within the scope of our approach, we show that societal management of atmospheric carbon via tCDR can lead to a collateral transgression of the planetary boundary of land system change. Our analysis indicates that the opportunities to remain in a desirable region within carbon-related planetary boundaries only exist for a small range of anticipation levels and depend critically on the underlying emission pathway. While tCDR has the potential to ensure the Earth system's persistence within a carbon-safe operating space under low-emission pathways, it is unlikely to succeed in a business-as-usual scenario.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "ee89beaee83e3c3acbfd947e2fcc9a990531c9b1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2796294392", "DOI": "10.1002/2015WR017290", "CorpusId": 55022295}, "title": "Vertically integrated models for coupled two\u2010phase flow and geomechanics in porous media", "abstract": "Models of reduced dimensionality have been found to be particularly attractive in simulating the fate of injected CO2 in supercritical state in the context of carbon capture and storage. This is motivated by the confluence of three aspects: the strong buoyant segregation of the lighter CO2 phase above water, the relatively long time scales associated with storage, and finally the large aspect ratios that characterize the geometry of typical storage aquifers. However, to date, these models have been confined to considering only the flow problem, as the coupling between reduced dimensionality models for flow and models for geomechanical response has previously not been developed. Herein, we develop a fully coupled, reduced dimension, model for multiphase flow and geomechanics. It is characterized by the aquifer(s) being of lower dimension(s), while the surrounding overburden and underburden being of full dimension. The model allows for general constitutive functions for fluid flow (relative permeability and capillary pressure) and uses the standard Biot coupling between the flow and mechanical equations. The coupled model retains all the simplicities of reduced\u2010dimensional models for flow, including less stiff nonlinear systems of equations (since the upscaled constitutive functions are closer to linear), longer time steps (since the high grid resolution in the vertical direction can be avoided), and less degrees of freedom.

In this work, a novel microporous adsorbent for carbon capturing was developed via functionalization of zeolitic imidazolate frame-work-91 (ZIF-91) to generate a hard/hard (metal-oxygen) structure named as lithium-modified ZIF-91 (ZIF-91-OLi compound). To this purpose, the ZIF-91 compound as an intermediate product was achieved by reduction of ZIF-90 in the presence of NaBH4 as a good reducing agent. Afterwards, acidic hydrogen atoms in the hydroxyl groups of ZIF-91 were exchanged with lithium cations via reaction of n-BuLi compound as an organo lithium agent through an appropriate procedure. In particular, the as-synthesized ZIF-91-OLi operated as an excellent electron-rich center for CO2 adsorption through trapping the positive carbon centers in the CO2 molecule. DFT calculations revealed that the presence of lithium over the surface of ZIF-91-OLi adsorbent plays an effective role in double enhancement of CO2 storage via creating a strong negative charge center at the oxygen atoms of the imidazolate linker as a result of the lithium/hydrogen exchange system. Finally, the selectivity of CO2/N2 was investigated at different temperatures, revealing the ZIF-91-OLi as a selective adsorbent for industrial application.\n", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "2cb7cd6133542d86f5c9e97d31c68356b33c6302", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2235571585", "CorpusId": 130879886}, "title": "Guidelines for Community Engagement in Carbon Dioxide Capture, Transport, and Storage Projects", "abstract": null, "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "f1bcd84543759d40f6da2ae52e5133a69d1ec4d6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2004068803", "DOI": "10.1007/S10562-007-9087-8", "CorpusId": 95279764}, "title": "The dynamic surface chemistry during the interaction of CO with ceria captured by Raman spectroscopy", "abstract": "The interaction of CO with ceria under conditions typically used to measure the oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of automotive three way catalysts (TWC) has been investigated by in situ Raman spectroscopy.

In addition, the low mass loading/utilization of sulfur is another key factor that makes Li-S batteries difficult to commercialize. Here, a porous catalytic V2O3/V8C7@carbon composite derived from MIL-47 (V) featuring heterostructures is reported to be an efficient polysulfide regulator in Li-S batteries, achieving a substantial increase in sulfur loading while still effectively suppressing the shuttle effect and enhancing kinetics. Systematic mechanism analyses suggest that the LiPSs strongly adsorbed on the V2O3 surface can be rapidly transferred to the V8C7 surface through the built-in interface for subsequent reversible conversion by an efficient catalytic effect, realizing enhanced regulation of LiPSs from capture to conversion. In addition, the porous structure provides sufficient sulfur storage space, enabling the heterostructures to exert full efficacy with a high sulfur loading. Thus, this S-V2O3/V8C7@carbon@graphene cathode exhibits prominent rate performance (587.6 mAh g-1 at 5 C) and a long lifespan (1000 cycles, 0.017% decay per cycle). It can still deliver superior electrochemical performance even with a sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm-2. These heterostructures can be further applied in pouch cells and produce stable output at different folding angles (0-180\u00b0).

In addition, energy\ntechnologies that involve injection or withdrawal of fluids from the subsurface can also create induced seismic events that can be measured and felt. Historically known induced seismicity has generally been small in both magnitude and intensity of ground shaking.

Naturally occurring CO2 deposits provide unique natural analogues for evaluating and validating methods used for the detection and monitoring of CO2 spreading and degassing into the atmosphere. Geological and hydrological structures of the Cheb Basin (NW Bohemia, Czech Republic) represent such a natural analogue for investigating CO2 leakage and offer a perfect location at which to verify monitoring tools used for direct investigation of processes along preferential migration paths.

The case study presents the results obtained from a joint application of geoelectrical measurements in combination with soil CO2 concentration and flux determination methods, for the detection and characterization of natural CO2 releases at gas seeps (as part of a hierarchic monitoring concept).

When CO2 is injected into deep saline aquifers, stratigraphic and structural trapping is the major basic mechanism controlling CO2 storage capacity and migration in reservoirs. Therefore, a safety risk assessment method is proposed in this paper using perspectives from hydrogeological and environmental geology. The uncertainties and risks consist of CO2 leakage, ground deformation, and induced earthquakes. Identifying and assessing potential risks are the first and most important step in the process of risk assessment. Based on the identification of risks of CO2 geological storage projects, we built an elementary risk evaluation index system in an analytic hierarchy process framework. Meanwhile, the possibility of occurrence and damage to the environment and public caused by CO2 leakage, ground deformation, and induced earthquakes was analyzed in detail, and current risk criteria were also summarized. Furthermore, using the Shenhua CO2 Capture and Storage Demonstration Project as a case study, we performed a risk identification and evaluation by using qualitative or semi-quantitative methods in sequence, as well as developing the related preliminary risk management measures.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is considered to be the most promising strategy to mitigate the anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. This review aims to provide the latest developments of CO 2 storage from the perspective of improving safety and economics. The mechanisms and strategies of CO 2 storage, focusing on their characteristics and current status, are discussed firstly. In the second section, the strategies for assessing and ensuring the security of CO 2 storage operations, including the risks assessment approach and monitoring technology associated with CO 2 storage, are outlined. In addition, the engineering methods to accelerate CO 2 dissolution and mineral carbonation for fixing the mobile CO 2 are also compared within the second section. The third part focuses on the strategies for improving economics of CO 2 storage operations, namely enhanced industrial production with CO 2 storage to generate additional profit, and co-injection of CO 2 with impurities to reduce the cost. Moreover, the role of multiple CCS technologies and their distribution on the mitigation of CO 2 emissions in the future are summarized. This review demonstrates that CO 2 storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs could play an important role in reducing CO 2 emission in the near future and CO 2 storage in saline aquifers may make the biggest contribution due to its huge storage capacity. Comparing the various available strategies, CO 2 -enhanced oil recovery (CO 2 -EOR) operations are supposed to play the most important role for CO 2 mitigation in the next few years, followed by CO 2 -enhanced gas recovery (CO 2 -EGR). The direct mineralization of flue gas by coal fly ash and the pH swing mineralization would be the most promising technology for the mineral sequestration of CO 2 . Furthermore, by accelerating the deployment of CCS projects on large scale, the government can also play its role in reducing the CO 2 emissions.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "69810768dc487f6f41f04934cbbf94d0dd1291dd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2165132207", "CorpusId": 111294706}, "title": "Energy Systems and Sustainability: Power for a Sustainable Future (2nd ed.)", "abstract": "The only text to provide a fresh, contemporary perspective on energy and sustainability for an undergraduate audience \n Includes extensive coverage of both fossil fuels and nuclear power, but in the context of an increasing use of renewable energy \n Boxes throughout the text present clear explanations of the technologies, underlying physics, and more advanced topics \n \nNew to this edition \n \n International comparisons of key energy statistics now include India and China in addition to the UK, USA, France, and Denmark, giving a truly global perspective \n Increased coverage of the 'peak oil' debate and the environmental implications of China's increasing energy use \n Significantly revised and expanded exploration of the sustainability of fossil fuel use, with new material on carbon capture and storage, the social cost of carbon, hybrid electric cars, and prospects for a hydrogen economy \n Start-of-chapter overviews and end-of-chapter reviews aid navigation and consolidation of information \n Appendix of US units \n \nHow can we provide clean, safe, sustainable energy supplies for the world despite rising population levels and increasing economic development?

Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) that underpin the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios assessed by IPCC have played a critical role in building and assessing deep decarbonisation narratives. However, their high-level aggregation and their complexity can cause them to be perceived as non-transparent by stakeholders outside of the IAM community. This paper bridges this gap by offering a comprehensive assessment of BECCS assumptions as used in IAMs so as to open them to a wider audience. We focus on key assumptions that underpin five aspects of BECCS: biomass availability, BECCS technologies, CO2 transport and storage infrastructure, BECCS costs, and wider system conditions which favour the deployment of BECCS. Through a structured review, we find that all IAMs communicate wider system assumptions and major cost assumptions transparently. This quality however fades as we dig deeper into modelling details. This is particularly true for sets of technological elements such as CO2 transport and storage infrastructure, for which we found the least transparent assumptions. We also found that IAMs are less transparent on the completeness of their treatment of the five BECCS aspects we investigated, and not transparent regarding the inclusion and treatment of socio-cultural and institutional-regulatory dimensions of feasibility which are key BECCS elements as suggested by the IPCC.

Capturing CO2 from ambient air has been considered as a carbon-negative technology to mitigate anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the air. The performance of a mesoporous silica-supported polyethyleneimine (PEI)\u2013silica adsorbent for CO2 capture from ambient air has been evaluated in a laboratory-scale Bubbling Fluidized Bed (BFB) reactor. The air capture tests lasted for between 4 and 14 days using 1 kg of the PEI\u2013silica adsorbent in the BFB reactor. Despite the low CO2 concentration in ambient air, nearly 100% CO2 capture efficiency has been achieved with a relatively short gas\u2013solid contact time of 7.5 s. The equilibrium CO2 adsorption capacity for air capture was found to be as high as 7.3 wt%, which is amongst the highest values reported to date. A conceptual design is completed to evaluate the technological and economic feasibility of using PEI\u2013silica adsorbent to capture CO2 from ambient air at a large scale of capturing 1 Mt-CO2 per year. The proposed novel \u201cPEI-CFB air capture system\u201d mainly comprises a Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) adsorber and a BFB desorber with a CO2 capture capacity of 40 t-CO2/day. Large pressure drop is required to drive the air through the CFB adsorber and also to suspend and circulate the solid adsorbents within the loop, resulting in higher electricity demand than other reported air capture systems. However, the Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA) technology adopted for the regeneration strategy in the separate BFB desorber has resulted in much smaller thermal energy requirement. The total energy required is 6.6 GJ/t-CO2 which is comparable to other reference air capture systems. By projecting a future scenario where decarbonization of large point energy sources has been largely implemented by integration of CCS technologies, the operating cost under this scenario is estimated to be $108/t-CO2 captured and $152/t-CO2 avoided with an avoided fraction of 0.71.

In order to decarbonise the energy sector as well as the transportation sector, the fossil fuels need to be efficiently converted to hydrogen and the resulted CO2 to be captured and then used / stored. The Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) technologies are promising options of efficiently combating climate change (by significantly reducing the greenhouse gas emissions) as well as continuing of using the fossil fuels.\nThis paper is assessing the key updated technical and economical performances of hydrogen production based on natural gas reforming with and without carbon capture. As illustrative examples, conventional steam reforming and autothermal reforming (using both oxygen and air) of natural gas were evaluated. The CO2 capture technology was based on pre-combustion capture configuration using gas-liquid absorption. As illustrative cases, Methyl-DiEthanol-Amine (MDEA) as a chemical solvent and SelexolTM as a physical solvent were assessed for their performances. The evaluated hydrogen production concepts have a capacity of 100,000 Nm3/h (corresponding to 300 MWth based on lower heating value) with a purity higher than 99.95 % (vol.). The paper presents in details the evaluated hydrogen production concepts based on natural gas reforming, modelling and simulation aspects, model validation, mass and energy integration issues as well as proposing an integrated methodology for quantification of key economic aspects. As the results show, the conventional steam reforming has higher energy utilisation factor (about 5 net percentage points) than the autothermal reforming cases. The carbon capture rate is about 65 - 70 % for the conventional steam reforming considered as an illustrative case. The economic indicators show better performances for conventional steam reforming in comparison to autothermal reforming in term of specific capital investment cost (about 12 - 24 % lower), operational and maintenance costs (about 7 % lower), hydrogen costs (about 5 - 10 % lower).

Changes in these interactions may influence ecosystem functioning. Links between plant functional diversity, soil microbial communities and ecosystem functioning have been demonstrated in experiments using plant monocultures and mixtures, using broad plant and microbial functional groups, but have not been examined in diverse natural plant communities. We quantified the relative effects of plant and microbial functional properties on key ecosystem functions. We measured plant functional diversity, soil microbial community composition and parameters associated with nitrogen (N) cycling and key nutrient cycling processes at three grassland sites in different parts of Europe. Because plant structure and function strongly influence soil microbial communities, we determined relationships between ecosystem properties, plant traits and soil community characteristics following a sequential approach in which plant traits were fitted first, followed by the additional effects of soil micro\u2010organisms. We identified a continuum from standing green biomass and standing litter, linked mostly with plant traits, to potential N mineralization and potential leaching of soil inorganic N, linked mostly with microbial properties. Plant and microbial functional parameters were equally important in explaining % organic matter content in soil. A parallel continuum ran from plant height, linked with above\u2010ground biomass, to plant quality effects captured by the leaf economics spectrum, which were linked with the recycling of carbon (C) and N. More exploitative species (higher specific leaf area, leaf N concentrations and lower leaf dry matter content) and taller swards, along with soil microbial communities dominated by bacteria, with rapid microbial activities, were linked with greater fodder production, but poor C and N retention.

The United States, China, and some other countries are highly dependent on coal. In the United States, coal-powered plants generate more than half the electricity, and some observers expect that expanding the use of coal will help reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil. But coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Thus a new technology called carbon capture and storage (CCS) has recently gained considerable attention. CCS aims to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from any large point source, liquefy it, and store it underground. Because of its high costs and complex infrastructure, CCS is by necessity suited primarily for centralized, large-scale power stations or big industrial facilities like cement plants and steelworks. With today\u2019s technologies, there are three ways to capture CO2. Post-combustion capture, which involves capturing CO2 from flue gases in conventional power stations, is basically available today, but it has not yet been demonstrated at a commercial power station scale. In the longer term, this technology is unlikely to become widely established unless its energy consumption can be reduced significantly. A more efficient method is pre-combustion capture of CO2 in coal-fired power stations with integrated gasification combined cycle technology. These plants use heat to gasify coal that is then burned to generate electricity. During the gasification step, CO2 can be removed relatively easily. Apart from its higher efficiency levels, the prime advantage of this method lies in its flexibility in terms of both fuel (coal, biomass, and substitute fuels) and product (electricity, hydrogen, synthetic gas, and liquid fuel). Pre-combustion capture of CO2 has not yet been demonstrated on a large scale. The so-called oxyfuel process currently offers the best prospects for CO2 capture in terms of achievable overall process efficiency as well as costs because it is largely based on conventional power station components and technology. Combustion takes place in 95 percent pure oxygen rather than air, enabling efficient CO2 capture due to the concentrated flue gas. This process is still near the beginning of its demonstration phase. It is expected to capture 99.5 percent of the emissions directly at the stack, while the post-combustion and pre-combustion methods would reduce CO2 by 88\u201390 percent on average.1 Carbon Capture and Storage", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "bd691c76cfe5c6cba771fdcba9071870233fbd67", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2040810243", "DOI": "10.1021/es5018575", "CorpusId": 7419989, "PubMed": "25286282"}, "title": "Cost-effective choices of marine fuels in a carbon-constrained world: results from a global energy model.", "abstract": "The regionalized Global Energy Transition model has been modified to include a more detailed shipping sector in order to assess what marine fuels and propulsion technologies might be cost-effective by 2050 when achieving an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 400 or 500 ppm by the year 2100.

The analyses confirmed that the thermal efficiencies of all the systems (MCFC stand-alone, hybrid, hybrid with oxy-combustion capture, hybrid with post-combustion capture) were significantly improved by introducing the off-gas recirculation.

Methane hydrate has many practical applications such as separation processes, natural gas storage transportation, and carbon dioxide sequestration. For the industrial utilization of this substance, it is essential to find a rapid method of manufacturing it. This work studies the formation of methane hydrates by using tetrahydrofuran (THF) and oxidized carbon nanotubes (OMWCNTs) by testing different fluid mixtures of THF and carbon nanotubes. The results show that when the mixed fluid contained THF, the OMWCNTs showed the gas consumption 5.2\u2009times that of distilled water at 3.4\u2009K subcooling. Also, THF's effects as a thermodynamic phase equilibrium promoter were preserved when it was used with OMWCNTs. Therefore, it can be expected that when OMWCNTs are used with an aqueous mixture of THF, both the favorable phase equilibrium of THF and the high gas consumption of the carbon nanotubes can be obtained.
