The BET surface area and total pore volume of the as-synthesized sample were 2887 m2/g and 1.23 cm3/g, respectively. The dry sample exhibited a CO2 adsorption capacity of 19.21 mmol/g at 276 K and 3.57 MPa. The CO2 adsorption uptake increased considerably when an amount of water was pre-adsorbed onto the sample, possibly as a result of the formation of CO2 hydrate in the pore spaces of the activated carbon. The maximum CO2 adsorption capacity of the wet sample was found to be 29.02 mmol/g at 273 K and 3.57 MPa.

The method is based on capture of carbon dioxde from power plants or industrial facilities, after which carbon dioxde is purified, compressed and transported by pipelines or tanker ships for long-term storage. Large underground geological formations, such as depleted oil and gas field as well as saline aquifers, are the most promising places for storing carbon dioxide, but the suitability of each formation has to be individually determined. Carbon capture and storage technology is partially based on existing technology used by the chemical industry as well as by the oil and gas industry. Carbon dioxide is captured and stored already in a number of demonstration projects in conjunction with oil and gas production, but the technology has not yet been implemented in commercial-scale power plants. Some of the specific challenges of the method are the large amounts of carbon dioxide that needs to be captured, uncertainties and liability issues with long-term storage of carbon dioxide, and the high level of costs for the technology. In addition to technology and economy also the development of international regulations is required for large-scale deployment of CCS. Due to EU\u0092s climate action and renewable energy the interest in carbon capture and storage has awakened also in Finland, although Finnish geology is not favorable for storage of carbon dioxide. The development of CCS is especially seen in Finland as a possibility for export of technology. The real benefit of CCS in mitigating the climate change will depend on how widely CCS-technology is deployed world-wide.

The analysis of environmental burdens other than GHG emissions shows some trade-offs associated with CO2 removal, especially land transformation for system layouts with photovoltaics (PV) electricity supply.

The high computational cost associated with running large\u2010scale numerical simulations in a Monte Carlo sense has motivated the development of surrogate models, which aim to capture the important input\u2010output relations of physics\u2010based models but require only a fraction of the cost of full model runs. In this work, we formulate a conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (cDC\u2010GAN) surrogate model to learn the dynamic functional mappings in multiphase models. The cDC\u2010GAN belongs to a class of semisupervised learning methods that can be used to learn the data generation processes. Like the original GAN, a main strength of the cDC\u2010GAN is that it includes a self\u2010training scheme for improving the quality of generative modeling in a game theoretic framework, without requiring extensive statistical knowledge and assumptions on input data distributions. In particular, our cDC\u2010GAN model is designed to learn cross\u2010domain mappings between high\u2010dimensional input (e.g., permeability) and output (e.g., phase saturations) pairs, with the ability to incorporate conditioning information (e.g., prediction time). As a use case, we demonstrate the performance of cDC\u2010GAN for predicting the migration of carbon dioxide (CO2) plume in heterogeneous carbon storage reservoirs, which has both numerical and practical significance because of the safe storage requirements now mandated in many countries. Results show that cDC\u2010GAN achieves high accuracy in predicting the spatial and temporal evolution patterns of the injected CO2 plume, as compared to the original results obtained using a compositional reservoir simulator. The performance of cDC\u2010GAN models, trained using the same number of training samples, stays relatively robust when the level of spatial heterogeneity is increased. Our cDC\u2010GAN is pattern based and is not limited by the underlying physics. Thus, it provides a general framework for developing surrogate models, and for conducting uncertainty analyses for a wide range of physics\u2010based models used in both groundwater and subsurface energy exploration applications.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "c358c3ac1463c4297087e9385f9134c2fdee84fa", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 218535713}, "title": "Including renewable electricity generation and CCS into the DART model", "abstract": "This paper describes how a variety of renewable electricity generation technologies (wind, hydro, solar, and solid biomass) and advanced electricity generation from coal and gas including carbon capture and storage (CCS) is included into the multi-region, multi-sector recursive dynamic CGE-model DART.

When prediction uncertainty needs to be quantified, one has to use the respective statistical counterparts, e.g., Bayesian updating of model parameters and data assimilation. For complex and large-scale systems, however, even single forward deterministic simulations may require parallel high-performance computing. This often makes accurate brute-force and nonlinear statistical approaches infeasible. We propose an advanced framework for parameter inference or history matching based on the arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion (aPC) and strict Bayesian principles. Our framework consists of two main steps. In step 1, the original model is projected onto a mathematically optimal response surface via the aPC technique. The resulting response surface can be viewed as a reduced (surrogate) model. It captures the model\u2019s dependence on all parameters relevant for history matching at high-order accuracy. Step 2 consists of matching the reduced model from step 1 to observation data via bootstrap filtering. Bootstrap filtering is a fully nonlinear and Bayesian statistical approach to the inverse problem in history matching. It allows to quantify post-calibration parameter and prediction uncertainty and is more accurate than ensemble Kalman filtering or linearized methods. Through this combination, we obtain a statistical method for history matching that is accurate, yet has a computational speed that is more than sufficient to be developed towards real-time application. We motivate and demonstrate our method on the problem of CO2 storage in geological formations, using a low-parametric homogeneous 3D benchmark problem.

This year, power companies began invitations for tenders of the new thermal power facilities. The increase of them, however, brings up another serious issue: how to cope with combating global warming. That is why CCUS/ CCS is receiving more attention nowadays together with the discussion on carbon dioxide emission reduction. Electric machinery companies, putting focus on CO2 capture technologies have successfully developed the capture technologies for coal and gas fired power stations with their own funds and/or in collaboration with power companies.

The update allows NREL to estimate the costs of such systems that are compatible with the higher operating temperatures associated with advanced power cycles. The goal of the Department of Energy (DOE) Solar Energy Technology Program is to develop solar technologies that can make a significant contribution to the United States domestic energy supply. The recent DOE SunShot Initiative sets a very aggressive cost goal to reach a Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of 6 cents/kWh by 2020 with no incentives or credits for all solar-to-electricity technologies.1 As this goal is reached, the share of utility power generation that is provided by renewable energy sources is expected to increase dramatically. Because Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) is currently the only renewable technology that is capable of integrating cost-effective energy storage, it is positioned to play a key role in providing renewable, dispatchable power to utilities as the share of power generation from renewable sources increases. Because of this role, future CSP plants will likely have as much as 15 hours of Thermal Energy Storage (TES) included in their design and operation. As such, the costmore\u00a0\u00bb and performance of the TES system is critical to meeting the SunShot goal for solar technologies. The cost of electricity from a CSP plant depends strongly on its overall efficiency, which is a product of two components - the collection and conversion efficiencies. The collection efficiency determines the portion of incident solar energy that is captured as high-temperature thermal energy. The conversion efficiency determines the portion of thermal energy that is converted to electricity. The operating temperature at which the overall efficiency reaches its maximum depends on many factors, including material properties of the CSP plant components. Increasing the operating temperature of the power generation system leads to higher thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency. However, in a CSP system, higher operating temperature also leads to greater thermal losses. These two effects combine to give an optimal system-level operating temperature that may be less than the upper operating temperature limit of system components. The overall efficiency may be improved by developing materials, power cycles, and system-integration strategies that enable operation at elevated temperature while limiting thermal losses. This is particularly true for the TES system and its components. Meeting the SunShot cost target will require cost and performance improvements in all systems and components within a CSP plant. Solar collector field hardware will need to decrease significantly in cost with no loss in performance and possibly with performance improvements. As higher temperatures are considered for the power block, new working fluids, heat-transfer fluids (HTFs), and storage fluids will all need to be identified to meet these new operating conditions. Figure 1 shows thermodynamic conversion efficiency as a function of temperature for the ideal Carnot cycle and 75% Carnot, which is considered to be the practical efficiency attainable by current power cycles. Current conversion efficiencies for the parabolic trough steam cycle, power tower steam cycle, parabolic dish/Stirling, Ericsson, and air-Brayton/steam Rankine combined cycles are shown at their corresponding operating temperatures. Efficiencies for supercritical steam and carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}) are also shown for their operating temperature ranges.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "888d5fbb7c31b6cd8402e7b6d83a19037a7654c9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2044414559", "DOI": "10.1016/j.marpolbul.2014.07.042", "CorpusId": 5681672, "PubMed": "25125286"}, "title": "Simulation of the potential effects of CO2 leakage from carbon capture and storage activities on the mobilization and speciation of metals.", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "79de1322a377e9675321c2855e499af279b47f0f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2021309812", "DOI": "10.2118/109060-MS", "CorpusId": 109393498}, "title": "Transport of CO2 for Carbon Capture and Storage in the UK", "abstract": null, "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "46cf52282f20b2f7907357c45d7b38b0192a29fd", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 44470883}, "title": "A COMPARISON OF HAZARD AND RISKS FOR CARBON DIOXIDE AND NATURAL GAS PIPELINES \u2020", "abstract": "# Crown Copyright Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), particularly from power stations, will lead to an increased requirement for pipelines carrying carbon dioxide from capture locations to storage locations.

It also analyzes IEA CCS regulatory framework as a guideline and provides limitations and implications for marine geological storage in the Republic of Korea. Although CCS master plan is established at national level, related laws are not amended and detailed polices are not yet provided. Established 'Intergovernmental CCS committee' lacks its cooperative mechanism and flexibility. Only limited and segmented economic analyses are performed and funding for large scale of CCS project is not secured. In addition, information sharing is limited and public awareness activities are insufficient. Therefore, this paper provides some policy suggestions on establishing a legal framework based on the 'Marine Environmental Management Act', strengthening the role of intergovernmental CCS committee, conducting CCS economic analysis based on various scenarios, providing economic incentives and public participation strategies, and establishing a specialized agency for information sharing.Key Words : Climate change, Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage, CCS regulatory framework, Marine geological storage, Marine Environmental Management Act", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "2577bd709fba2e20fe0e10a1126e17aa5c1d8c94", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1988791960", "DOI": "10.2514/1.J053390", "CorpusId": 119896061}, "title": "Interfacial Strain Energy Dissipation in Hybrid Nanocomposite Beams Under Axial Strain Fields", "abstract": "A micromechanics and structural dynamics analysis of inherent damping exhibited by representative hybrid nanocomposite beams under axial strains is presented.

They are synthesized from metal and organic building blocks by solvothermal reactions or self-assembly. MOFs and PCPs are considered to be a class of the most promising materials for hydrogen storage and for gas separation such as carbon dioxide capture from the flue gas or natural gas. However, gas adsorption on the pore surface of MOFs and PCPs is physisorption, and the interaction energy between the adsorbents and gas is too weak. Therefore, even though large amount of gases can be stored in the materials at a low temperature, the storage capacity falls down to very low values at ambient temperature. To enhance hydrogen gas storage in MOFs and PCPs, we have modified their pore spaces by various methods such as generating accessible metal sites, fabricating metal nanoparticles (NPs), including proper organic guests, and incorporating specific metal ion binding sites in the ligand. The generation of accessible metal sites is based on \u201cKubas\u201d interactions of hydrogen molecules with the metal ions. The production of metal nanoparticles in PCPs, without using extra reducing agent and NP-stabilizing agents just at room temperature, is based on the redox chemistry between the redox-active components of the MOFs or PCPs and the metal ions. To capture CO2 selectively from the industry flue gas that contains not only CO2 but also other gases, we have developed smart 3-dimensional (3D) PCPs with very small pores, which are highly flexible. Since CO2 molecule has much higher polarizability and quadrupole moment than other gases, it would interact much more strongly with the flexible PCPs with very small pores and open up the windows while other gases cannot. We have also created various strategies such as post-synthetic modification of pore space with highly flexible carboxyl pendants, impregnation of metal ions in the pores of a MOF, and inclusion of branched polyethylenimine units in the pores of porous organic polymer. These induce stronger interactions with the CO2 molecules, and enhance the gas uptake capacities and the selectivity of CO2 adsorption In this review, properties and applications of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous coordination polymers (PCPs) are described. Many MOFs and PCPs are highly flexible and responsive to external stimuli. Sometimes they transform their structures to others by maintaining the single crystallinity. For decades, MOFs and PCPs have been regarded as a class of the promising materials for hydrogen storage and carbon dioxide capture applications since they adsorb large amounts of gases at low temperatures. However, their gas uptake capacities decrease dramatically at ambient temperature compared to those at low temperatures because they physic-sorb gases by weak interaction energies. Therefore, to enhance gas storage and separation abilities of MOFs and PCPs at ambient temperature, we have modified their pore spaces. In this review, some characteristic properties of MOFs and PCPs will be introduced, and various strategies for modifying the pore spaces of PCPs and MOFs for hydrogen storage and carbon dioxide capture will be presented.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "e2e2c1d4c66d17c5621b8896deb59f6e5ef2462c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2497275324", "CorpusId": 114851247}, "title": "Optimising CO2 storage in geological formations; a case study ofshore Scotland - CO2 MultiStore project", "abstract": "Carbon capture, transport and storage (CCS) is considered a key technology to provide a secure, low-carbon energy supply and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions (DECC, 2014) that contribute to the adverse effects of climatic change (IPCC, 2014). Commercialisation projects for the permanent storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) captured at power plants are currently in the design stage for the Peterhead, White Rose, Caledonia Clean Energy (DECC, 2013, 2015) and Don Valley projects. Storage of the CO2 captured by these projects is planned in strata deep beneath the North Sea in depleted hydrocarbon fields or regionally extensive sandstones containing brine (saline aquifer sandstones). \nThe vast majority of the UK and Scotland's potential storage resource, which is of European significance (SCCS, 2009), is within brine-saturated sandstone formations. The sandstone formations are each hundreds to thousands of square kilometres in extent and underlie all sectors of the North Sea. The immense potential to store CO2 in these rocks can only be fully achieved by the operation of more than one injection site within each formation.\nGovernment, university and research institutes, industry, and stakeholder organisations have anticipated the need\nto inform a second phase of CCS developments following on from a commercialisation project in Scotland. The CO2MultiStore study, led by Scottish Carbon Capture and Storage (SCCS), investigates the operation of more than one injection site within a storage formation using a North Sea case study. The Captain Sandstone, within the mature oil and gas province offshore Scotland, contains the Goldeneye Field, which is the planned storage site for the Peterhead CCS project. Previous research (SCCS, 2011) was augmented by data from offshore hydrocarbon exploration and detailed investigation of the Goldeneye Field for CO2 storage (Shell, 2011a-i).\nThe research was targeted to increase understanding and confidence in the operation of two or more sites within \nthe Captain Sandstone. Methods were implemented to reduce the effort and resources needed to characterise the sandstone, and increase understanding of its stability and performance during operation of more than one injection site. Generic learning was captured throughout the CO2MultiStore project relevant to the characterisation of the extensive storage sandstones, management of the planned injection operations and monitoring of CO2 injection at two (or more) sites within any sandstone formation.\nThe storage of CO2 can be optimised by the operation of more than one injection site in a geological formation by\ntaking a regional-scale approach to site assessment. The study concludes that at least 360 million tonnes of CO2 captured over the coming 35 years could be permanently stored using two injection sites in the Captain Sandstone. Confidence in the planned operation of two or more injection sites in a storage formation is greatly increased by the use of existing information, knowledge and data acquired during hydrocarbon exploitation.\nWidespread pressure changes should be expected by the injection of CO2 at more than one site. Assessment, management and monitoring of pressure changes on a regional scale will optimise the storage capacity, ensure security of storage and prevent adverse effects to existing storage and hydrocarbon operations.\nThe vast offshore potential across all sectors of the North Sea could be made accessible and practical for storage of CO2 captured from European sources by the operation of two or more sites in a storage formation by following the approach taken in CO2MultiStore.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "c2b2b16b0e3e71941aaf623ee703868b8bcf6ac8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2929485689", "CorpusId": 140308197}, "title": "Systems and methods for integrated energy storage and cryogenic carbon capture", "abstract": "The systems and methods integrate energy storage with cryogenic carbon capture, providing effective grid management and energy-efficient carbon capture capabilities to power plants.

To improve process economics and accelerate commercial deployment, research has increased around product utilization, where markets exist primarily in the construction industry. This review assesses the potential for advancing MC product utilization to decrease CO2 emissions toward neutral, or even negative, values. First, the literature surrounding the current state and challenges for indirect MC processes is reviewed, indicating that process intensification and scale-up are important areas for further research. Alkalinity sources available for MC are examined, differentiating between those sourced from industrial processes and mining operations. Investigation of possible end uses of carbonate products reveals that further CO2 avoidance can be achieved by replacing conventional carbon-intensive products. Companies that are currently commercializing MC processes are categorized based on the feed used and materials produced. An analysis of company process types indicates that up to 3 GtCO2 year\u20131 could be avoided globally. It is suggested that upcoming commercial efforts should focus on the carbonation of industrial wastes located near CO2 sources to produce precast concrete blocks. Carbonation of conventional concrete shows the highest potential for CO2 avoidance, but may face some market resistance. Carbonation of Mg silicates lacks sufficient market demand and requires the development of new high-value products to overcome the expense of mining and feed preparation. It is suggested that research focus on enhanced understanding of magnesia cement chemistry and the development of flame-retardant mineral fillers. C \u00a9 2019 The Authors.

As a consequence, the decision was made to extend the lifetime of German nuclear power plants beyond the limits imposed by the previous governing parties. Then, about five months later, in March 2011, the catastrophic earthquake off the coast of Japan and the concomitant tsunami destroyed Fukushima Daiichi, and, within a couple of weeks, the German government s nuclear energy policy crumbled. In June 2011, Chancellor Angela Merkel officially declared that Germany will cease using nuclear energy beyond the year 2022. From a pessimistic but probably realistic point of view, this hurried and to some extent emotionally driven decision will most likely imply a considerable increase in global CO2 emission originating from newly built conventional combustion plants. In this context, the development of new, emissionpoor or emission-free energy resources as a long-term goal becomes more urgent. Even more important for the near future is the development of highly efficient CO2 capture and storage/recycling (CCS) methods as transitory technologies. The storage problem is completely unsolved; this feature also holds true for the long-term disposal of nuclear waste and is one more reason for the departure from nuclear energy. Moreover, today s CO2 capture techniques are far from fullscale application because of several extremely difficult requirements. This was described explicitly in the \u201cReport of the Basic Energy Sciences Workshop for Carbon Capture: Beyond 2020\u201d published by the U.S. Department of Energy in March 2010: \u201cThe carbon capture problem is a true grand challenge for today s scientists. Postcombustion CO2 capture requires major new developments in disciplines spanning fundamental theoretical and experimental physical chemistry, materials design and synthesis, and chemical engineering. [...] A typical 550 MW coal-fired electrical plant produces about two million cubic feet of flue gas per minute (i.e. about 1000 m s ), containing a mixture of CO2, H2O, N2, O2, NOx, SOx, and ash; however, the CO2 is present at very low concentrations (< 15% after conventional combustion). The sheer quantity of CO2 that must be captured ultimately dictates that the capture medium must be recycled over and over. Hence the CO2 once bound, must be released with relatively little energy input. [...] Further, the CO2 must be rapidly and selectively pulled out of a mixture that contains many other gaseous components. [...] It is this nexus of high-speed capture with high selectivity and minimal energy loss that makes this a true grand challenge problem, far beyond any of today s artificial molecular manipulation technologies, and one whose solution will drive the advancement of molecular science to a new level of sophistication.\u201d For CO2 capture from flue gas, concepts based on liquid absorption, solid adsorption, and membrane separation are already available at various levels of realization. One of the most common and best-established methods is the absorption by aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions. In this approach CO2 is first removed from the input gas stream in an adsorber unit at low temperatures/high pressure, and is then removed from the adsorber in a second step in the so-called stripper unit at elevated temperatures/reduced pressure for further processing (e.g. pressurizing for transport and storage). In both steps, gases have to pass the liquid/gas interface; detailed information on this interface is crucial for the understanding of the whole process. Despite its importance, the liquid/gas interface is still far from being well-understood. This is mainly related to the fact that\u2014apart from surfacesensitive optical as well as X-rayand neutron-scattering methods and computer simulations\u2014most surface-sensitive techniques such as photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) require ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) conditions incompatible with common liquids having high vapor pressure. However, sophisticated and advanced experimental PES methods have been developed recently that cope with the vapor pressure of water in aqueous systems. In recent work, Lewis et al. used synchrotron-based soft X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy combined with vacuum liquid microjets (this technique was established by M. Faubel and B. Winter around 2000). By investigating the near-surface region of aqueous MEA solutions with and without CO2 loading, the authors were able to demonstrate the non-isotropic distribution of molecules within the first 1\u20132 nm.

This already causes problems of overcapacity and grid congestion in countries where the fraction of RE exceeds the 20% level. A system approach is needed, which focusses not only on the energy source, but includes conversion, storage, transport, distribution, use and, last but not least, the recycling of waste. Furthermore, there is a need for more flexibility in the energy system, rather than relying on electrification, integration with other energy systems, for example the gas network, would yield a system less vulnerable to failure and better adapted to requirements. For example, long-term large-scale storage of electrical energy is limited by capacity, yet needed to cover weekly to seasonal demand. This limitation can be overcome by coupling the electricity net to the gas system, considering the fact that the Dutch gas network alone has a storage capacity of 552 TWh, sufficient to cover the entire EU energy demand for over a month. This lecture explores energy storage in chemicals bonds. The focus is on chemicals other than hydrogen, taking advantage of the higher volumetric energy density of hydrocarbons, in this case methane, which has an approximate 3.5 times higher volumetric energy density. More importantly, it allows the ready use of existing gas infrastructure for energy storage, transport and distribution. Intermittent wind electricity generated is converted into synthetic methane, the Power to Gas (P2G) scheme, by splitting feedstock CO2 and H2O into synthesis gas, a mixture of CO and H2. Syngas plays a central role in the synthesis of a range of hydrocarbon products, including methane, diesel and dimethyl ether. The splitting is accomplished by innovative means; plasmolysis and high-temperature solid oxygen electrolysis. A CO2-neutral fuel cycle is established by powering the conversion step by renewable energy and recapturing the CO2 emitted after combustion, ultimately from the surrounding air to cover emissions from distributed source. Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU) coupled to P2G thus creates a CO2-neutral energy system based on synthetic hydrocarbon fuel. It would enable a circular economy where the carbon cycle is closed by recovering the CO2 emitted after reuse of synthetic hydrocarbon fuel. The critical step, technically as well as economically, is the conversion of feedstock CO2/H2O into syngas rather than the capture of CO2 from ambient air.

Land-use change and forestry accounted for 10-12% of global GHG emissions from 2000-2011. However, forests, as a result of their growth, were a net sink for CO2 over the 2000-2009 period by a variety of estimation methods.5 Given the critical but variable role of forests in global carbon cycling, it is crucial to communicate to policymakers and other experts involved in climate-change planning how basic forest biology and forest management translate into climate warming mitigation (hereafter referred to simply as \u2018mitigation\u2019).

The United States, China, and some other countries are highly dependent on coal. In the United States, coal-powered plants generate more than half the electricity, and some observers expect that expanding the use of coal will help reduce U.S. reliance on foreign oil. But coal is the most carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Thus a new technology called carbon capture and storage (CCS) has recently gained considerable attention. CCS aims to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from any large point source, liquefy it, and store it underground. Because of its high costs and complex infrastructure, CCS is by necessity suited primarily for centralized, large-scale power stations or big industrial facilities like cement plants and steelworks. With today\u2019s technologies, there are three ways to capture CO2. Post-combustion capture, which involves capturing CO2 from flue gases in conventional power stations, is basically available today, but it has not yet been demonstrated at a commercial power station scale. In the longer term, this technology is unlikely to become widely established unless its energy consumption can be reduced significantly. A more efficient method is pre-combustion capture of CO2 in coal-fired power stations with integrated gasification combined cycle technology. These plants use heat to gasify coal that is then burned to generate electricity. During the gasification step, CO2 can be removed relatively easily. Apart from its higher efficiency levels, the prime advantage of this method lies in its flexibility in terms of both fuel (coal, biomass, and substitute fuels) and product (electricity, hydrogen, synthetic gas, and liquid fuel). Pre-combustion capture of CO2 has not yet been demonstrated on a large scale. The so-called oxyfuel process currently offers the best prospects for CO2 capture in terms of achievable overall process efficiency as well as costs because it is largely based on conventional power station components and technology. Combustion takes place in 95 percent pure oxygen rather than air, enabling efficient CO2 capture due to the concentrated flue gas. This process is still near the beginning of its demonstration phase. It is expected to capture 99.5 percent of the emissions directly at the stack, while the post-combustion and pre-combustion methods would reduce CO2 by 88\u201390 percent on average.1 Carbon Capture and Storage", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "00d3a689787e24130733f8a8b82eba3b37470a41", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2478587548", "CorpusId": 133525757}, "title": "The view from China", "abstract": "Contrary to popular belief, the problem of climate change is being actively discussed in China.

M. Benson's Editorial, \u201cNegative-emissions insurance\u201d (27 June, p. [1431][1]). EASAC has recently completed two studies on carbon capture and storage (CCS) ([ 1 ][2]) and on biofuels in Europe ([ 2 ][3]). The studies broadly support Benson's view that bioenergy with CCS might make a useful contribution to climate change mitigation in Europe, but their overall conclusion is that it is likely to be modest.\n\nAs Benson recognizes, CCS is expensive. Costs are likely to be higher for biomass CCS than for CCS associated with large fossil-fuel\u2013based plants, as the biomass CCS will be smaller scale and often remote from CO2 transport and storage facilities. The EASAC study concluded that there is rather limited scope to bring costs down.\n\nConfidence in the long-term integrity of CO2 storage will build slowly, given the need to monitor geological processes over long periods of time. This will slow the rate of the rollout of CCS in Europe. Furthermore, only limited indigenous biomass resources in Europe can sustainably be harvested for energy uses without deleterious impacts on the environment and food production.\n\nThe research, development, and demonstration of relevant technologies to promote biomass-based CCS should be actively pursued, but it is no silver bullet.\n\n1.

We characterized the culturable fungal isolates at three sampling sites representative of different degrees of mineral weathering by isolating the genomic subunits and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA genes using PCR and sequencing of cloned fragments. We chose the specific strain primarily identified as Talaromyces sp. for the further experiments with lizardite because of this strain's remarkable tolerance to high [Mg2+] (1 mol\u00b7L\u22121) and [Ni2+] (10 mM\u00b7L\u22121) levels in the screening test and its ubiquity in the most severely weathered samples. Results of dissolution experiments revealed that both magnesium-release rate and efficiency were significantly increased (e.g., by a factor of up to 15) in the presence of fungal cells than those in the abiotic controls. The enhanced dissolution of lizardite was mainly attributed to the fungal production of organic acids including oxalic acid, gluconic acid, formic acid, and fumaric acid added to the solution. The proton-promoted dissolution, however, was indicated not to be the only mechanism for fungus-lizardite interactions as much lesser Mg (in wt.%) was recovered in the abiotic system where the solution pH was constantly adjusted to match that of the fungal system. We also explored the dependence of fungal dissolution (of lizardite) on temperature and mineral particle sizes. In particular, we found that up to \u223c 50 wt.% of Mg was released from mineral particles of \u223c 50 \u03bcm within 30 days at 38\u00b0C, \u223c 26% and 8% higher than that at 18\u00b0C and 28\u00b0C, respectively. At the same temperature of 28\u00b0C, the Mg-release efficiency increased from 12.2 wt% for particles of \u223c 270 \u03bcm to 38.4 wt% for those of \u223c100 \u03bcm although no apparent difference was recognized when the particle size decreased below 100 \u03bcm. The nonlinear correlation of dissolution rates with particle surface areas suggested that the dissolution process was controlled by mineral surface-structural modification along with Mg release and by fungal cells\u2019 interaction with these surface structures. An amorphous layer of Mg-depleted silica was detected at the reacted mineral surface by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). Formation of glushinskite (MgC2O4\u00b72H2O) was also observed when oxalate was accumulated to certain concentrations in the solution. Overall, this study showed that the isolated Talaromyces sp. was a promising bioagent to improve the efficacy of cation release from serpentine minerals for the purpose of carbon sequestration and resource recovery.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "d95985bbe752dcd6fb22d4c4a59055413bb81711", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1523442904", "DOI": "10.1016/S1570-7946(10)28117-8", "CorpusId": 16648037}, "title": "Mathematical modeling and simulation of gasification processes with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) for energy vectors poly-generation", "abstract": null, "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "3fbcdc9e27e58ebacd932b64e92bd7247fc97958", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2789305584", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.7b06412", "CorpusId": 3915991, "PubMed": "29547694"}, "title": "Configuration of Materially Retained Carbon in Our Society: A WIO-MFA-Based Approach for Japan.", "abstract": "To achieve the goals of Paris Agreement, global society is directing much effort in substantially reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In addition to energy-related efforts, prevention of carbon release into the atmosphere with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and/or utilization of biomass resources is considered indispensable to achieving the global objective. In this study, considering carbon-containing goods as carbon reservoirs in our society similar to forests and reservoirs enabling CCS, the flow of materially utilized carbon was quantified by input-output-based material flow analysis (IO-MFA). As a result, in 2011, 6.3 Mt-C of petroleum-derived carbon and 7.9 Mt-C of wood-derived carbon were introduced to the Japanese society as end-use products (e.g., automobiles and constructions) in various forms (e.g., plastics and synthetic rubbers). The total amount (14.2 Mt-C) corresponded to 4.1% (52.1 Mt-CO2) of annual CO2 emission in Japan in 2011. Subsequently, by referring to the technology that can treat carbon in the target forms in end-of-life products, the recoverability of carbon as a material has been discussed with respect to each form and end-use of carbon.

For example, in 2007, the Minnesota Legislature set goals to reduce our emissions 15% by 2015, 30% by 2025, and 80% by 2050. These reductions can be achieved by reducing combustion of fossil fuels, and by reducing other activity that generates greenhouse gases. Changes in land use can induce increased storage of carbon in soil and vegetation, thus facilitating terrestrial sequestration of emissions from the full range of sources, including vehicle emissions. In the case of stationary sources of carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, however, such as the coal-fired electrical generating stations, ethanol plants, and other stationary sources that make up over one-third of Minnesota CO 2 emissions, the technology to capture CO 2 is available, pending developments in methods and costs. The likely fate of CO 2 captured from stationary sources would be storage by geologic sequestration, also known as carbon capture and storage, by injection into underground geologic formations where it can be stored for long periods of time to prevent its escape to the atmosphere. This method is in the early deployment phase worldwide, but estimates indicate it may permit 15 to 55% of the emissions reductions needed to avoid dangerous levels of climate change. In addition, analyses indicate that achieving these reductions will be less costly if geologic carbon sequestration is an option. Another geologic technique is mineral carbonation, in which CO 2 is reacted with material from mining, producing mineral products for disposal or use in construction. While Minnesota has favorable geology for this option, the method is not fully developed and the costs remain high. With respect to the deep injection method, an option for Minnesota is export of CO 2 from stationary sources by pipeline to one or more potentially willing jurisdictions such as North Dakota or Illinois, where apparently suitable geologic repositories have been confirmed. It is possible, however, that saline formations in Minnesota could be confirmed as geologic CO 2 repositories, possibly enabling carbon storage without the requirement for negotiations with neighboring jurisdictions and export by pipeline. The only rocks in Minnesota that potentially have the required reservoir properties below about a kilometer depth, the depth required for efficient CO 2 storage, are sequences of sedimentary rocks associated with the Midcontinent Rift, a southwestward extension \u2026", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "bb1eb1e1dc0974bd0a2ef2f43c6dd7c341257b4e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2073034209", "DOI": "10.4209/AAQR.2013.04.0121", "CorpusId": 97268589}, "title": "Comparative life cycle assessment (LCA) of accelerated carbonation processes Using Steelmaking Slag for CO2 Fixation", "abstract": "Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is one of the most prominent emerging technologies for mitigating global climate change.

Six scenarios of carbonation for basic oxygen furnace slag (BOFS), steel converted slag (SCS), and blended hydraulic slag cement (BHC) in different types of reactors and/or method were established.

In addition, sensitivity analysis was carried out to evaluate the relevant uncertainties of heating efficiency on the GHG emissions in direct carbonation processes. According to the results of LCA and sensitivity analysis, the direct carbonation of steelmaking slag in a slurry reactor was found to be the most attractive method, since the GWP was the lowest among the selected scenarios. Furthermore, the best available technology (BAT) for CO2 capture by carbonation processes of alkaline wastes was proposed according to the key performance indicators (KPIs) with respect to engineering considerations and environmental impacts.

We face many uncertainties that would affect the demand for each of these technologies in the future. The costs of these technologies decrease due to learning-by-doing as their capacity is built out. Given that we face uncertainties over future energy demands for particular technologies, and that costs reduce with experience, an important question that arises is whether policy makers should encourage early investments in technologies before they are economically competitive, so that they could be available in the future at lower cost should they be needed. If society benefits from early investments when future demands are uncertain, then there is an option value to investing today. This question of whether option values exist is investigated by focusing on Coal-fired Power Plants with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as a case study of a new high-cost energy technology that has not yet been deployed at commercial scale. A decision analytic framework is applied to the MIT Emissions Prediction Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, a computable general equilibrium model that captures the feedback effects across different sectors of the economy, and measures the costs of meeting emissions targets. Three uncertainties are considered in constructing a decision framework: the future stringency of the US GHG emissions policy, the size of the US gas resource, and the cost of electricity from Coal with CCS. The decision modeled is whether to begin an annual investment schedule in Coal with CCS technology for 35 years. Each scenario in the decision framework is modeled in EPPA, and the output measure of welfare is used to compare the welfare loss to society of meeting the emissions target for each case. The decision framework is used to find which choice today, whether to invest in CCS or not, gives the smallest welfare cost and is therefore optimal for society. Sensitivity analysis on the probabilities of the three uncertainties is carried out to determine the conditions under which CCS investment is beneficial, and when it is not. The study finds that there are conditions, specified by ranges in probabilities for the uncertainties, where early investment in CCS does benefit society. The results of the decision analysis demonstrate that the benefits of CCS investment are realized in the latter part of the century, and so the resulting optimal decision depends on the choice of discount rate. The higher the rate, the smaller the benefit from investment until a threshold is reached where choosing to invest becomes the more costly decision. The decision of whether to invest is more sensitive to some uncertainties investigated than others. Specifically, the size of the US gas resource has the least impact, whereas the stringency of the future US GHG emissions policy has the greatest impact. This thesis presents a new framework for considering investments in energy technologies before they are economically competitive. If we can make educated assumptions as to the real probabilities we face, then extending this framework to technologies beyond CCS and expanding the decision analysis, would allow policymakers to induce investment in energy technologies that would enable us to meet our emissions targets at the lowest cost possible to society.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "45b018c1adea2be21c9eaeebc28dcc6e7a3bddfc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2154059103", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2015.01.020", "CorpusId": 53644166}, "title": "Modelling ruptures of buried high pressure dense phase CO2 pipelines in carbon capture and storage applications\u2014Part I.

Herein, we prepared an electroless high-phosphorus Ni-P coating and, for the first time, systematically explored the underlying mechanism of the interfacial process in applying Ni-P coating to protect pipeline steel that transports impure SC CO2. It is found that, benefiting from the formation of a protective surface film, Ni-P coating significantly mitigates the corrosion effects from SC CO2 and impurities (e.g., O2 and NO2), especially the synergistic effect of impurities. Concurrently, it effectively avoids the localized corrosion resulting from nonuniform adsorption of the aqueous phase. Although O2 and NO2 can degrade the coating through boosting water precipitation, deteriorating the water chemistry, and reducing the surface film protectiveness, the corrosion inhibition efficiency of Ni-P coating is invariably higher than 80%, independent of the varying causticity of SC CO2 streams, demonstrating that the coating has a superior stability toward corrosion attack.

In the Illinois Basin in the United States, the Cambrian Mount Simon Sandstone has been targeted as a reservoir for carbon capture and storage (CCS). In this CCS system, the Eau Claire Formation is expected to serve as the primary seal to prevent upward migration of the CO2 plume; however, little work has been done to specifically determine how well it will function as a seal. Although the lateral extent and thickness of the Eau Claire Formation, along with its generally low permeability, certainly make it a prime candidate to serve in this capacity, the primary depositional fabric and mineralogy, which are the fundamental controls on the petrophysical charter of this unit, remain poorly constrained. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the lithologic, mineralogical, and petrophysical properties of the Eau Claire Formation in an effort to characterize its potential as a functional seal in a CCS system. Sixty-six core-derived Eau Claire Formation samples from seven wells within the Illinois Basin are described using a combination of petrography, reflectance spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, geochemical, and petrophysical analyses. These analyses show that the Eau Claire Formation contains five different lithofacies (sandstone, clean siltstone, muddy siltstone, silty mudstone, and shale) with fine-scale heterogeneities in fabric and mineralogy that greatly influence the petrophysical properties. Porosity, permeability, and entry-pressure data suggest that some, but not all, lithofacies within the Eau Claire Formation have the capability to serve as a suitable CCS seal. Abundant authigenic minerals and dissolution textures indicate that multiple generations of past fluid-rock interactions have occurred within the Eau Claire Formation, demonstrating that much of the formation has behaved as a fluid conduit instead of as a seal. Minerals that would be potentially reactive in a CCS system (including carbonate, glauconite, and chlorite) are common in the Eau Claire Formation. Dissolution of these and other phases in the presence of carbonic acid could potentially jeopardize the sealing integrity of the unit. Although complexities in the sealing properties exist, the dynamics of the CCS system and the potential for precipitation of new minerals should allow the Eau Claire Formation to serve as an adequate seal.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "c603215f12a03c718d70bd25d9e358405f218698", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3173153981", "DOI": "10.1016/J.TECHFORE.2021.120933", "CorpusId": 237724401}, "title": "Observing technology reserves of carbon capture and storage via patent data: Paving the way for carbon neutral", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "72141fa9e5e09516a089745b0f02683ec2406c76", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2756274560", "DOI": "10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2017.09.180", "CorpusId": 158223541}, "title": "A Plant Tolerance Index to Select Soil Leaking CO2 Bio-indicators for Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "db910f79b5aedf91a2142834a845907403f0ddaf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "50463684", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-444-59519-5.50012-5", "CorpusId": 107663537}, "title": "Integrated assessment of carbon capture and storage technologies in coal-based power generation using CAPE tools", "abstract": null, "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "69053961e93c21ef63b606db1af9c66a6d6e3472", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 211257481}, "title": "The Global Potential for Carbon Dioxide Removal", "abstract": "The global physical potential of different methods of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere is reviewed.

This reveals, for example, that use of waste nutrient flows to feed macro-algae for biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (algal BECCS), shows significant CDR potential, without needing the large land areas or freshwater supplies of plant biomass energy crops. Adding up the potentials of different CDR methods, the total CDR potential at present is 1.5\u20133 PgC yr 1 (Petagram of carbon per year), comparable in size to either the natural land or ocean carbon sinks. Already 0.55\u20130.76 PgC yr 1 of this potential has been realised through afforestation and inadvertent ocean fertilisation. The total CDR potential (without including direct air capture) grows such that by mid-century it is 4\u20139 PgC yr 1 and by the end of the century it is 9\u201326 PgC yr , comparable with current total CO2 emissions of 10 PgC yr . The CDR that can be realised under social, economic and engineering constraints is always going to be less than the physical potential. Nevertheless, if combined with reducing CO2 emissions (conventional mitigation), CDR has the physical potential to help stabilise atmospheric CO2 by the middle of this century. 52 Issues in Environmental Science and Technology, 38 Geoengineering of the Climate System Edited by R.E.

The focus of one such effort is on the capture and storage of CO2 (carbon dioxide) from anthropogenic fixed source emissions.

We discuss the origins of the decline and assess the effects of policy interventions by the Trump administration. We find that, with fierce competition from natural gas and renewables, a further decrease of coal consumption must be expected by the old and inefficient U.S. coal-fired electricity generation fleet. By contrast, we consider the overly optimistic (for coal producers) view of the U.S. Energy Information Agency, and test whether the tide for the U.S. coal industry could turn as a result of three potential support measures: (i) revoking the Clean Power Plan (CPP); (ii) facilitating access to the booming Asian market; and (iii) enhanced support for Carbon Capture, Transport and Storage (CCTS) technology. We investigate the short-term and long-term effects on U.S. coal production using a comprehensive partial equilibrium model of the world steam coal market, COALMOD-World (Holz, Haftendorn, Mendelevitch, & von Hirschhausen, 2016). We find that revoking the CPP could stop the downward trend of steam coal consumption in the U.S., but even allowing for additional exports, will not lead to a return of U.S. coal production to the levels of the 2000s, that is, over 900\u2005Mt per year. When global steam coal use is aligned with the 2\u00b0C climate target, U.S. steam coal production drops to around 100\u2005Mt per year by 2030 and below 50\u2005Mt by 2050, even if CCTS is available and exports via the U.S. West Coast is possible. Key policy insights Declining U.S. coal use is primarily caused by competition from natural gas and renewables not by environmental regulation of the coal sector. Without substantial policy support, U.S. coal-fired generation capacity will continue to decline rapidly. Revoking the Clean Power Plan will lead to about one eighth higher U.S. coal production in the next years. Carbon Capture, Transport and Storage does not prevent the rapid decline of coal use required under stringent climate policy. Even in the most extreme pro-coal scenarios with additional export possibilities, U.S. coal production will not return to its pre-2010 levels.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "15e2bfc753b245bc95d297919d32998449a0f8f5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2734985457", "CorpusId": 55928513}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage Hazard Investigation: Numerical Analysis of Hazards Related to Dry Ice Bank Sublimation Following Accidental Carbon Dioxide Releases", "abstract": "Climate Change is caused by greenhouse gases such as CO2.

Any accidental release determined by failures is followed by a pressurized release of CO2 with dry ice formation. Under specific conditions a dry ice bank will form contributing to atmospheric dispersion through superficial sublimation (Vianello et al., 2014). This study focuses on the importance of the bank sublimation emission to the near field dispersion of CO2. The application of CFD techniques show that hazardous conditions exist over an area close to the source. Within 50 m from the pipeline the volumetric fraction of CO2 still amounts to 7 \u2013 10 % at 1.5 m above the ground, causing serious health effects on operators in a short time. In addition, a decrease in wind velocity coupled with an increase in both the ambient temperature and the intensity of solar radiation worsens the risk of health hazards. The danger persists for days after the accident given the slow dry ice bank sublimation process which becomes the dominant hazard source afterwards.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "a19cc0796d877e4ac82eee264c3857c6c07007d5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2181395724", "CorpusId": 131199026}, "title": "Numeric modeling of carbon dioxide sequestration in deep saline aquifers in Wangchang Oilfield-Jianghan Basin, China", "abstract": "Climate change has become one of the most pressing issues globally with the increased emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere and the resultant impacts on the environment threatening development and life on Earth. Anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) into the atmosphere are largely blamed for this effect and carbon capture and storage (CCS) in geologic media is an enabling technology that can be utilized to mitigate global warming whilst still continuing to use fossil fuel until the end of the fossil era. Deep saline aquifers in sedimentary basins have a large potential for CO 2 storage. China has a rapidly growing economy with large remaining coals reserves hence her future CO 2 emissions are bound to increase from the present high levels. We have developed a simple 2-dimensional homogenous model to study the spatial and temporal distribution and storage of CO 2 injection into Wangchang Oilfield, Jianghan Basin, one of China\u2019s largest inland sedimentary basins. A 10 year injection phase followed by 90 years shut-in is modeled. During the injection period, most of the gas exists in a supercritical state trapped beneath the caprock. When injection ceases, the gas gradually dissolves into the formation brine. Increase in vertical to horizontal permeability ratio, residual gas saturation and salinity all have different effects on the CO 2 spatial migration, dissolution in brine and overall storage.

Carbon Capture and Storage from Industrial Sources", "abstract": "The industrial sector is responsible for 21% of all global carbon dioxide emissions, and, as such, emissions mitigation is as important in this sector as in the power generation sector. Individual industries are sufficiently diverse that bespoke capture strategies must be created for them, with different technologies more appropriate for different industries. One major difference between industrial and power carbon capture and storage (CCS) is that industries often have numerous sources of varying sizes and CO2 concentration, requiring some degree of aggregation or multiple capture units in order to capture large proportions of flue gases, implying an important trade-off between capture rate and cost. Within the chemical manufacturing industries, there exist streams of high-purity CO2 which can be used for demonstration CCS schemes at a lower cost than other flue streams, and as a first mover towards wide scale deployment. However, attempting to calculate the cost of industrial CCS is difficult since there are a wide range of reported costs from literature, with little consensus even within technologies for the same industry. Policy challenges remain broadly similar to those encountered in the power industry, though due to the global markets for industrial products, some market mechanism would be required in the event of unilateral decarbonisation in order not to penalise first-mover entities.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "2fe80106eddf9e41908d1d8735e5e93ce796a768", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3013567447", "DOI": "10.1039/d0ta00793e", "CorpusId": 216363749}, "title": "Co nanoparticles combined with nitrogen-doped graphitic carbon anchored on carbon fibers as a self-standing air electrode for flexible zinc\u2013air batteries", "abstract": "Although zinc\u2013air batteries (ZABs) have been extensively studied due to their advantages, there is still room for improving flexible ZABs especially by identifying suitable self-standing flexible electrode materials.

Once implemented successfully, CCS can store at least 5\u00a0billion tons of CO2 per year as an effective and technologically safe method. However, there have been a few issues raised in recent years, indicating the potential leakages paths created during and after injection. One of the major issues might be the chemical interaction of supercritical CO2 with the cement, which may lead to the partial or total loss of the cement sheath. There have been many approaches presented to improve the physical and mechanical properties of the cement against CO2 attack such as changing the water-to-cement ratio, employing pozzolanic materials, and considering non-Portland cements. However, a limited success has been reported to the application of these approaches once implemented in a real-field condition. To date, only a few studies reported the application of nanoparticles as sophisticated additives which can reinforce oil well cements. This paper provides a review on the possible application of nanomaterials in the cement industry where physical and mechanical characteristics of the cement can be modified to have a better resistance against corrosive environments such as CO2 storage sites. The results obtained indicated that adding 0.5\u00a0wt% of Carbon NanoTubes (CNTs) and NanoGlass Flakes (NGFs) can reinforce the thermal stability and coating characteristics of the cement which are required to increase the chance of survival in a CO2 sequestrated site.

However, the capacity of mangrove sediments to store high amounts of OC has never been explained mechanistically. This study elucidates the role of reactive iron (FeR) in long-term carbon sequestration in mangrove sediments.Materials and methodsSediment samples of up to 1\u00a0m in depth were collected from six selected mangrove areas across the Philippines. The samples were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF). A citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite reduction procedure was employed to extract FeR from the sediments. The OC concentration and \u03b413C signatures before and after FeR extraction were determined using a dichromate oxidation technique and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), respectively.Results and discussionXRD diffractograms showed that the mangrove sediment samples varied in terms of mineralogical characteristics, which reflected their different parent materials. It was found that the OC concentration increased exponentially (OC\u2009=\u20098.38e0.37FeR; R2\u2009=\u20090.88; p\u2009<\u20090.0001) with increasing FeR concentration. \u03b413C signatures of FeR-associated OC revealed that FeR preferentially preserved terrestrial over marine-derived organic matter. Finally, FeR was estimated to coprecipitate with up to 5.44\u2009\u00d7\u20091012\u00a0g OC in mangrove sediments per year.ConclusionsThe findings of this study suggest that FeR is responsible for the preservation of OC, thus making mangrove sediments a \u201cgiant rusty sponge\u201d for carbon.

Over the last few years, interest in CCU has grown significantly, and many innovative technological approaches to the industrial CO2 utilization are under development, such as CO2 conversion to construction materials, plastics, fertilizers, fuels, etc. At the same time, the analysis of the CO2 utilization market shows that all existing industrial CO2 applications consume relatively small quantities of CO2, thus for the CCU to present a practical interest as a sink for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the markets for the CO2-derived products would need to be increased by orders of magnitude.

In this study, we have proposed CO2 capture and storage via hydrate in geological formation within the hydrate stability zone as a novel technique to contribute to global warming mitigation strategies, including carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and to prevent vast methane release into the atmosphere caused by hydrate melting. We have attempted to enhance total gas uptake and CO2 capture efficiency in hydrate in the presence of kinetic promoters while using diluted CO2 gas (CO2-N2 mixture). Experiments are performed using unfrozen sands within hydrate stability zone condition and in the presence of low dosage surfactant and amino acids. Hydrate formation parameters, including sub-cooling temperature, induction time, total gas uptake, and split fraction, are calculated during the single-step formation and dissociation process. The effect of sands with varying particle sizes (160\u2013630 \u00b5m, 1400\u20135000 \u00b5m), low dosage promoter (500\u20133000 ppm) and CO2 concentration in feed gas (20\u201330 mol%) on formation kinetic parameters was investigated. Enhanced formation kinetics are observed in the presence of surfactant (1000\u20133000 ppm) and hydrophobic amino acids (3000 ppm) at 120 bar and 1 \u2103 experimental conditions. We report induction time in the range of 7\u2013170 min and CO2 split fraction (0.60\u20130.90) in hydrate for 120 bar initial injection pressure. CO2 split fraction can be enhanced by reducing sand particle size or increasing the CO2 mol% in incoming feed gas at given injection pressure. This study also reports that formation kinetics in a porous medium are influenced by hydrate morphology. Hydrate morphology influences gas and water migration within sediments and controls pore space or particle surface correlation with the formation kinetics within coarse sediments. This investigation demonstrates the potential application of bio-friendly amino acids as promoters to enhance CO2 capture and storage within hydrate. Sufficient contact time at gas-liquid interface and higher CO2 separation efficiency is recorded in the presence of amino acids.
