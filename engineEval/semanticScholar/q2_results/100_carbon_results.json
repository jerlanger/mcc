In this context, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies are acknowledged as promising solution in tackling the global warming. To evaluate the convenience of such a solution, the scientific community agree on the need to study both the economic advantages of carbon capture as well as its environmental impact. With reference to the estimation of the cost of CCS in power plants, the most frequently applied method is the so-called plant-level approach. This method compares the costs of electricity for a power plant with and without carbon capture. The environmental impact of CCS, instead, is determined through the calculation of the tons of CO2 avoided. In accordance with this methodological outline, this paper applies the plant-level approach to study the techno-economic and environmental convenience of installing a CCS system within a CCGT (Combined Cycle Gas Turbine) power plant in Italy, for which operating scenarios are presented and discussed.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "507d14b47be91a28768c5359149d7b335ddaa38a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3048466813", "DOI": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115627", "CorpusId": 225023967}, "title": "Advances in carbon capture, utilization and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "46ac5ca2fae0c9768f38589d58fd4281f6e8dc8d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2321797008", "DOI": "10.1021/ACS.CHEMMATER.5B03330", "CorpusId": 59146355}, "title": "Nitrogen-Rich Covalent Triazine Frameworks as High-Performance Platforms for Selective Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "The search for new efficient physisorbents for gas capture and storage is the objective of numerous ongoing researches in the realm of functional framework materials.

Factors affecting the market competitiveness of NGCC-CCS are examined by conducting a sensitivity analysis using the MARKet ALlocation energy system optimization model. The results indicate that widespread deployment of NGCC-CCS is better suited for a 30% energy system greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction trajectory than for a more stringent 50% reduction trajectory. Methane leakage rate, efficiency penalty, carbon dioxide (CO2) capture rate, and natural gas price are found to be the strongest factors influencing optimal NGCC-CCS deployment, in that order. NGCC plays an important role in meeting mid-term GHG targets across all model runs. A large portion of NGCC capacity is later retrofit with CCS, indicating that NGCC can be both a bridge to a low-carbon future and an integral part of that future. Thus, retrofitability and siting near CO2 storage should be considerations as new NGCC capacity is built. Regional results indicate that NGCC-CCS deployment would be greatest in the West South Central region, followed by the East North Central region. In a business-as-usual scenario, both regions have considerable electricity production from fossil fuels. Conventional coal and gas capacity are displaced under a GHG reduction target, opening the door for NGCC-CCS in these regions.

The Mercia samples analysed were either clay-rich (muddy) siltstones or relatively clean siltstones cemented by carbonate and gypsum. Porosity is fairly uniform (between 7.4 and 10.7%). Porosity is low either due to abundant depositional illite or abundant diagenetic carbonate and gypsum cements. Permeability values are as low as 10\u221220\u00a0m2 (10nD), and therefore, the Mercia has high sealing capacity. These rocks have similar horizontal and vertical permeabilities with the highest kh/kv ratio of 2.03 but an upscaled kh/kv ratio is 39, using the arithmetic mean of kh and the harmonic mean of kv. Permeability is inversely related to the illite clay content; the most clay-rich (illite-rich) samples represent very good caprock quality; the cleaner Mercia Mudstone samples, with pore-filling carbonate and gypsum cements, represent fair to good caprock quality. Pressure sensitivity of permeability increases with increasing clay mineral content. As pore pressure increases during CO2 injection, the permeability of the most clay-rich rocks will increase more than carbonate- and gypsum-rich rocks, thus decreasing permeability heterogeneity.

Here, we clarify the potential of CCS to mitigate emissions in the United States by developing a storage-capacity supply curve that, unlike current large-scale capacity estimates, is derived from the fluid mechanics of CO2 injection and trapping and incorporates injection-rate constraints.

We show that in the United States, if CO2 production from power generation continues to rise at recent rates, then CCS can store enough CO2 to stabilize emissions at current levels for at least 100 y.

We demonstrate an opportunity to significantly expand CCUS in the United States in the near-term, spurred by new financial incentives enacted in February 2018, by targeting the lowest-cost capture opportunities and by deploying only commercially proven technologies. The carbon dioxide pipeline transport network would serve near-term oil industry demand for carbon dioxide while also connecting multiple prospective long-term dedicated geological storage resources. This would be a flexible long-term infrastructure asset for carbon management in the United States that would enable and accelerate future CCUS deployment. In February 2018, the United States enacted significant financial incentives for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) that will make capture from the lowest-capture-cost sources economically viable. The largest existing low-capture-cost opportunity is from ethanol fermentation at biorefineries in the Midwest. An impediment to deployment of carbon capture at ethanol biorefineries is that most are not close to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) fields or other suitable geological formations in which the carbon dioxide could be stored. Therefore, we analyze the viability of a pipeline network to transport carbon dioxide from Midwest ethanol biorefineries to the Permian Basin in Texas, which has the greatest current carbon dioxide demand for EOR and large potential for expansion. We estimate capture and transport costs and perform economic analysis for networks under three pipeline financing scenarios representing different combinations of commercial and government finance. Without government finance, we find that a network earning commercial rates of return would not be viable. With 50% government financing for pipelines, 19 million tons of carbon dioxide per year could be captured and transported profitably. Thirty million tons per year could be captured with full government pipeline financing, which would double global anthropogenic carbon capture and increase the United States\u2019 carbon dioxide EOR industry by 50%. Such a development would face challenges, including coordination between governments and industries, pressing timelines, and policy uncertainties, but is not unprecedented.

The concentration level of each monitoring indicator decreases with increasing depth.

Changes in pore fluid pressure within the injection zone can induce low-magnitude seismic events. The induced seismicity associated with CCS needs to be properly addressed in order to obtain public acceptance for the technology and also to prevent possible CO2 leakage from the storage site due to fractures or fault-slip in the faults which can be reactivated due to injection. Simulation of CO2 injection inherently poses a multi-physics problem coupling thermal, hydrologic, and geomechanical processes. In this paper, a set of 2D coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical modeling was performed to simulate stress changes and resulting geomechanical deformations in the reservoir, caprock and fault due to CO2 injection. The model included a limited-dimension pre-existing fault which cannot be easily detected by surveys. The fault slip obtained from the numerical model was then used along with seismological theories to estimate the maximum magnitude of induced earthquake. A parametric study was performed to investigate the effects of reservoir properties as well as thermal stresses on geomechanical deformation, fault slip, pore pressure generation versus time, rupture time, and magnitude of induced events. The effects of permeability, porosity, and thickness of the reservoir were discussed. It was shown that thinner reservoirs have higher probability of fault reactivation and will result in larger induced seismic events. Reservoirs with higher porosity were shown to have longer rupture time and induce larger events. A higher permeable reservoir can decrease the potential of fault reactivation by generating lower buildup pore pressure and smaller fault slip. In general, for the given model geometry and injection characteristics, the heat flux never reached the fault by the time that the fault slip occurred and had no apparent effect on the results.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "dc9dfe4b7544aa77c5518652fe1655b040c5a334", "externalIds": {"MAG": "582636774", "DOI": "10.1061/9780784413678", "CorpusId": 127191990}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage: Physical, Chemical, and Biological Methods", "abstract": "Sponsored by the Carbon Capture and Storage Task Committee of the Technical Committee on Hazardous, Toxic, and Radioactive Waste Engineering of the Environmental Council of EWRI.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "878fbc24833bdd7b154f5a3e027ed1217644c724", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1982516221", "DOI": "10.1080/03932729.2015.994336", "CorpusId": 153914325}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage: A Controversial Climate Mitigation Approach", "abstract": "As the threats of climate change grow, the need to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel burning is increasingly acknowledged by governments around the world.

A number of approaches have been combined to make accurate predictions in all three phases (solid, liquid, and gas) and at all phase changes for application in the modeling of releases of CO at high pressure into the atmosphere. Predictions of a free release of CO into the atmosphere from a reservoir at a pressure of 10 MPa and a temperature of 283 K, typical of transport conditions in carbon capture and storage scenarios, is examined.
