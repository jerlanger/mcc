South West Hub Carbon Capture and Storage Project, WA", "abstract": "Summary In order to improve the South West Hub Carbon Capture and Storage (SW Hub) site characterisation and reduce uncertainties around CO2 capacity, injectivity and containment, conceptual fault hydrodynamic models are defined and numerical simulations are carried out to investigate the impact of faults on CO2 plume distribution. These simulations model a worst case scenario with a plume reaching the interface between the top of the proposed injection unit and a secondary containment unit. The conceptual fault hydrodynamic models are defined to incorporate host rock and fault properties accounting for fault zone lithology, cementation, and cataclastic processes. Numerical flow simulations of CO2 injection are performed to quantify cross- and up-fault migration of CO2 in case of plume-faults interaction. Here CO2 is intentionally injected close to a fault and >1,000 m shallower than the proposed large-scale injection depth, to force the supercritical CO2 to reach the discontinuity and the interface between injection and a secondary containment unit. Results show that if a CO2 plume reaches the top of the injection unit none of the compartment bounding faults in the SW Hub would critically control CO2 flow nor would they act as primary leakage pathways. CO2 flow at the top of a faulted injection unit is primarily controlled by the sedimentological morphology of the secondary containment unit.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "63ccf9963a02b8403ce1499ceb0dc48285d29cfd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2604388592", "CorpusId": 113795393}, "title": "Energy experts discuss carbon capturing and storage techniques at AUS lecture", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "a49b9a5c5d686ee09fc81fa3365a6f822b7f9d26", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3113377037", "CorpusId": 231485595}, "title": "Techno-Economic Assessment of CO2 Transport for Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "c2638ce5fd9b40e54f22960f5db3c74587bd2ad6", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 219681827}, "title": "The Herald: Aberdeen giant to work on key carbon capture and storage project", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "0192daff1ad76a427d71b912580c8f315f85cd23", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2598031170", "DOI": "10.4172/2157-7617.C1.025", "CorpusId": 116769295}, "title": "A systems apparoch to geo-engineering technologies: The case of carbon capture and storage CCS", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "fab9121819744828c736fe2bec4cf55db054121f", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 212412265}, "title": "Marine monitoring of carbon capture and storage : Methods , strategy , and potential impacts of excess inorganic carbon in the water column", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "54c0f1340779ac12b559bbc8245f4ab60c66d4c8", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.46427/gold2020.1647", "CorpusId": 240754481}, "title": "Characterization of Ultramafic Mine Tailings Reactivity for Carbon Capture, and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "1ed53e42571ccb081635a0edebc4555b04d95014", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2548914538", "CorpusId": 114075062}, "title": "Impact of impurities on pipeline specification and hydraulics", "abstract": "The purity of the CO2 stream emitted from carbon capture plants is extremely important for the design and operation of CO2 pipelines, affecting, amongst other things, the hydraulic efficiency and potential operating range as well as having implications for the safety and integrity of the pipeline system. However, to date, there is still uncertainty regarding the range of impurities that could enter the transport and storage systems for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) schemes. The main difficulty in being able to specify a CO2 pipeline composition is that the type and levels of potential impurities in the CO2 stream will differ between power plants and industrial sources and also between the capture technologies installed at the sources. The problem is further compounded by the fact that, not only does each impurity cause different effects on the transportation system, these effects, for any individual component, can vary with conditions and can, for example, alter gaseous and dense phase pipeline operation in different ways. Additionally, the mixtures of impurities in CO2 streams leaving different capture processes could vary substantially, leading to dramatically different effects on compression, transport and storage operations. This paper investigates the effects of impurities on pipeline sizing for dense phase and gaseous phase pipeline transportation using a series of twelve CO2 impurity scenario compositions. The scenarios have been selected as worst-case compositions that are representative of plausible CO2 streams from different capture technologies and industry sources. Two analyses are presented: i) an initial hydraulic analysis, conducted for a single point-to-point pipeline transporting a fixed flow rate of CO2 in either the dense phase or gaseous phase and ii) a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effects of inlet pressure, ambient temperature and mass flow rate and pipeline size and identify an optimum pipeline size to handle each scenario in a hydraulically efficient manner. The inlet and outlet temperature and pressure ranges for each pipeline were selected based on a detailed analysis of the thermodynamic properties of the different streams, which is also discussed. As a result of the study, conclusions are drawn regarding the compositions that present the most challenge with respect to hydraulic efficiency and pipeline costs. In addition, guidance is provided on the specification of inlet conditions to improve the hydraulic performance of the pipeline.

Two common industrial methods utilizing a difference in adsorption equilibrium of the gas components were investigated: 1) Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) including Vacuum Swing Adsorption (VSA), 2) Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA). A comparison of their energy consumption, suitability for industrial use with consideration of Carbon Capture and Storage standards is evaluated. A complex mathematical model for the adsorption step of the fixed bed adsorber was proposed and solved by the structural programming. Three adsorbent materials: Mg-MOF-74, UTSA-16, and Zeolite 13X were evaluated based on their CO2 adsorption capacity, selectivity, and market availability. Zeolite 13X was further explored.

However, economic incentives supporting commercialization and deployment of BioEnergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) are missing. This Policy and Practice Review discusses five different models for creating incentives and financing for BECCS, using Sweden as an example: (1) governmental guarantees for purchasing BECCS outcomes; (2) quota obligation on selected sectors to acquire BECCS outcomes; (3) allowing BECCS credits to compensate for hard-to-abate emissions within the EU ETS; (4) private entities for voluntary compensation; and (5) other states acting as buyers of BECCS outcomes to meet their mitigation targets under the Paris Agreement. We conclude that successful implementation of BECCS is likely to require a combination of several of the Policy Models, implemented in a sequential manner. The governmental guarantee model (Model 1) is likely to be required in the shorter term, so as to establish BECCS. Policy Models 2 and 3 may become more influential over time once BECCS has been established and accepted. Model 3 links BECCS to a large carbon-pricing regime with opportunities for cost-effectiveness and expanded financing. We conclude that Policy Models 4 and 5 are associated with high levels of uncertainty regarding the timing and volume of negative emissions that can be expected\u2014Thus, they are unlikely to trigger BECCS implementation in the short term, although may have roles in the longer term. Based on this study, we recommend that policymakers carefully consider a policy sequencing approach that is predictable and sustainable over time, for which further analyses are required. It is not obvious how such sequencing can be arranged, as the capacities to implement the different Policy Models are vested in different organizations (national governments, EU, private firms). Furthermore, it is important that a BECCS policy is part of an integrated climate policy framework, in particular one that is in line with policies aimed at the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the creation of a circular economy. It will be important to ensure that BECCS and the associated biomass resource are not overexploited. A well-designed policy package should guarantee that BECCS is neither used to postpone the reduction of fossil fuel-based emissions nor overused in the short term as a niche business for \u201cgreenwashing\u201d while not addressing fossil fuel emissions.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "3575b58440427da7b571df4b4d59d1b7b0fbff3f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2951142227", "CorpusId": 197568739}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage in Cina: Importanza e Sviluppo di questa Tecnologia", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "15ff138feb63e97d7d35375a294d0716e1b6725e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "63824505", "CorpusId": 107781334}, "title": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is not a long term viable solution for Australia", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "d98924bf0f0e25811ca48d227635f5bda7576dcc", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 201703318}, "title": "Removal NH 3 and Amine using Water-wash and Activated-carbon at Amine-based CO 2 Capture Process", "abstract": "CCS (CO2 capture technology and storage) using amines are the most important technology to reduce the global greenhouse gas emissions. However, amines can cause various environmental issues when the CO2 capture process is operated during the long-term. Therefore, the environmental stability of amines should be established in order to apply the CO2 capture process in the industry. Nitrosamine and nitramine are a harmful substance that are generated from the reaction between amine and NOx in the CO2 capture process. The USEPA (US Environmental Protection Agency) classified nitrosamines as toxic contaminants on CFR (Code of Federal Regulations) and the IARC (International Agency for Research on Cancer) regarded nitrosamines as human carcinogens and mutagenesis. The Norwegian climate and pollution agency regulated the emission of amines form CO2 capture facilities by limiting the total of emitted amine to 2,800 kg per year. Aqueous 30 wt% MEA (monoethanoamine) could be generate various toxic substances through three pathways such as aerosol, oxidative degradation, and thermal degradation. The generated toxic substances are discharged from the top of the absorber at the CO2 capture process, which causes a loss of the absorbent and operating-cost. The lost amines have the potential to contaminate the atmosphere and water quality through atmospheric diffusion and soil leachate and its cause carcinogenesis and mutagenesis in humans. Therefore, many researchers have conducted studies to treat the emission of amine from CO2 capture processes. Among amines, Dai and Mitch (2015) reported that nitrosamines were removed considerably by using water-wash and UV light in aminebased CO2 capture system. The Norwegian SINTEF team (2015) used water-wash and BDU (Brownian demister unit) methods to reduce amine impurities by more than 97%. However, additional NH3 removal processes are required because the previously studied methods are not suited for removal of produced NH3 from oxidative degradation. In this study, the adsorption column with water-wash and activated-carbon was used to remove amine and NH3. The amine gas for injection into the adsorption column was generated using a CSTR (Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor), and the temperature of reactor was kept constant at 60 C to simulate the absorber of CO2 capture process. The concentration of amine released to 55 ppm during the operation, 1 vol.% NH3 was pursued form special gas Co., and injected constantly into the adsorption column.

The WWG, which consists of a team of experts from government, academia, and industry, initiated its efforts with the preparation of a white paper on the nexus of CCS and water, which was published in January 2010. This white paper summarized the CCS processes and technologies that affect water usage, described the types of water that exist in deep formations targeted for storage, and described the potential impacts of CO2 storage on existing formation fluids as well as potable water resources. The treatment technologies that may be applied to water produced from these deep formations during CO2 storage were also addressed, including opportunities to utilize this water, as is or following treatment, as a resource for beneficial reuse. This initial effort was followed by a technology gap assessment workshop (2011) and a stakeholder survey (2012). The results of the former identified gaps for a number of technical challenges created by the CCS\u2013water nexus while the latter identified both technical and nontechnical topics that were of particular concern to a variety of CCS stakeholders.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the means proposed to lower the atmospheric CO2 content. The aim of the CarbFix project in Iceland was to design and test a CO2 re-injection system, in which CO2 from the Hellisheidi geothermal power plant was injected, fully dissolved in water, into basaltic rocks. In this way the carbon is mineralized upon basalt dissolution by the precipitation of carbonate minerals. Pre-injection study of the CarbFix site showed that the field consists of primitive basaltic rocks, both glassy and crystalline. The study further showed that the targeted aquifer contains high-pH water, ranging in temperature from 15 to 35\u00b0C, and is isolated from the atmosphere. The fluid chemistry indicated equilibrium with secondary minerals such as calcite, Ca-rich zeolites, and clays. Geochemical modelling of the injection schemes predicted that 1-2 moles of basaltic rock would be needed to lower the dissolved carbon in one kg of water back to pre-injection values by precipitation of Ca-Mg-Fe-carbonates. A syringe sampler for CO2-rich fluids and tracers was designed and tested, both in the laboratory and in the field. The sampler was used to monitor the carbonation process and the evolution of the CO2-rich fluid during the subsurface mineral carbonation. The 2010 Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull eruption provided a unique opportunity to study the impact of eruption mechanism, hydromagmatic versus magmatic, on the environmental chemistry. Plug-flow experiments were conducted on pristine volcanic ash, in order to evaluate the initial leaching from the ash surface. There was a dramatic difference in pH evolution between the effluent waters from the two ash types. Within minutes there was a \u201cchemical divide\u201d by several orders of magnitude in the proton concentration. The effluent from the hydromagmatic ash was alkaline, but the magmatic ash effluent was acidic. The effluent from the hydromagmatic ash thus became highly supersaturated with common secondary minerals formed in volcanic rocks, but nearly all these minerals were undersaturated in the acid effluent from the magmatic ash. The pH of surface waters in the vicinity of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull ranged from 4.8 to 8.2, with the low-range pH measured in the smaller Svadbaelis\u00e1-flood during the hydromagmatic phase, and in ash-polluted rivers during the magmatic phase. Polluted water from the combined ash layers showed neutral pH and high concentrations of dissolved nutrients and pollutants. The glacial floods in the Markarflj\u00f3t river were loaded with dissolved magmatic salts, but they also displayed neutralization by ash-dissolution with time. Large amounts of dissolved elements and suspended ash were transported to the North Atlantic Ocean. The flux of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) down the Markarflj\u00f3t river was 7 tonnes/s during the hydromagmatic phase and 2 tonnes/s during the magmatic phase, for an estimated total of 10,300 tonnes. These contrasting environmental impacts of magmatic versus hydromagmatic eruption phases showed that significant iron fertilization of the ocean by readily soluble metal salts was only possible from the magmatic ash. Furthermore, the hydro-magmatic ash protected the environment on land by neutralizing the acidic and polluted waters that had been in contact with the magmatic ash.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "a82d3ad1d2528e9c76173f1cfd631a2eeedac02e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2618304357", "CorpusId": 114746793}, "title": "What Can I Do to Stop Climate Change", "abstract": "Dr. Lackner invites you to demand carbon cleanup service.

On the other hand, CO 2 emissions resulting from burning fossil fuels continue to increase and contribute as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Global warming is a threat to the future of life. One of the countermeasures is by developing Carbon, Capture, and Utilization (CCU) technology based on a chemical absorption process to capture CO 2 gas from combustion. The captured CO 2 is then stored in a stable form so it will not be released into the atmosphere or used as raw material for the chemical industry. The main obstacle to implementing CCU technology on a large scale is the cost involved. Meanwhile, the revenue generated is relatively low. In CCU technology based on this chemical absorption process, chemicals as absorbents need to be regenerated and the CO 2 is separated for storage or use. However, this regeneration requires a relatively high cost. Several studies have attempted to perform this regeneration with micro-algae-based bioprocesses. Micro-algae can take energy from sunlight which is abundant in tropical areas such as Indonesia. In addition, several types of micro algae have the potential to be used as food and other utilizations.

In the province of Quebec, the most promising geological structure for carbon capture and storage is the St. Lawrence Lowlands sedimentary basin. This basin contains saline aquifers in which it is potentially possible to store several billion tons of CO2. These aquifers are overlain by thick impervious caprocks, the Utica and Lorraine shales, preventing vertical migration of CO2 toward the surface. However, such an injection implies that hydrogeological impacts of injection may be transmitted within the entire basin as pressure builds up, which may lead to water table rise in unconfined aquifers, and horizontal and vertical brine leakage from the reservoir to freshwater aquifers. The main objective of this thesis is to assess potential hydrogeological impacts of CO2 sequestration at the basin scale in the St. Lawrence Lowlands basin. In order to assess these impacts, the permeabilities of the Paleozoic formations have been evaluated by reinterpreting the raw data of drillstem tests that have been conducted in the basin, during hydrocarbon exploration campaigns. These results have been integrated into a core plug analysis database to create a hydrostratigraphic model of the units and a conceptual flow model of the basin. Subsequently, a 3D geological model of the St. Lawrence Lowlands basin has been modified to incorporate faults and has been imported into the FEFLOW numerical model to simulate the injection of CO2 in the basin. The simulations demonstrate the role played by faults, which divide the basin into multiple compartments and limit the pressure buildup across the basin. Simulations show that two wells located in two different compartments are enough to maintain an injection rate of 10 Mt/yr eq. CO2 during a hundred years without generating hydrogeological impacts. Due to the significant uncertainty that affects parameter values, a sensitivity analysis has been undertaken to define a set of conditions that allow hydrogeological impacts to occur at the basin scale. This analysis has shown that only under very unfavorable conditions, in which faults and the top aquifer have a high hydraulic conductivity and the top boundary of the domain is a no-flow boundary condition, a watertable rise ranging from 1 to 18 meters may occur, depending on the specific yield of the uppermost formations.

The risks can be categorized as exogenous risks (not in control of involved entities) and endogenous risks (arising from sub-optimal decisions by involved entities). A dominant reason for poor project performance is the endogenous risks associated with weak incentives to deliver optimal project outcomes. A key objective of this research is to illustrate that risk-sharing through contracts is central to incentivize the involved entities to maximize overall project value. The thesis presents a risk management framework for energy capital projects that accounts for both exogenous risks and endogenous risks to evaluate the optimal risk management strategies. This work focuses on a carbon capture and storage project (CCS) with enhanced oil recovery (EOR). CCS is projected to play a key role in reducing the global CO2 emissions. However, the actual deployment of CCS is likely to be lower than projected because of the various risks and uncertainties involved. The analysis of CCS-EOR projects presented in this thesis will help encourage the commercial deployment of CCS by identifying the optimal risk management strategies. This work analyzes the impact of the exogenous risks (market risks, geological uncertainty) on the value of the CCS-EOR project, and evaluates the optimal contingent decisions. Endogenous risks arise from the involvement of multiple entities in the CCS-EOR project; this thesis evaluates alternate CO2 delivery contracts in terms of incentives offered to the individual entities to make the optimal contingent decisions. Key findings from this work illustrate that the final project value depends on both the evolution of exogenous risk factors and on the endogenous risks associated with response of the entities to change in the risk factors. The results demonstrate that contractual risk-sharing influences decision-making and thus affects project value. For example, weak risk-sharing such as in fixed price CO2-EOR contracts leads to a high likelihood of sub-optimal decision-making, and the resulting losses can be large enough to affect investment and project continuity decisions. This work aims to inform decision-makers in capital projects of the importance of considering strong contractual risk-sharing structures as part of the risk management process to maximize project value.

As a consequence, in the US and in the EU significant actions, with similarities as well as differences, related to hydrogen RD if a fossil fuel is the energy source, it must be used with carbon sequestration to achieve significantly reduced CO2 emissions. Batteries offer similar options. Biofuels are more restrictive, and only advanced biofuels, such as cellulosic ethanol, would have a large impact on the emissions problem . Of course efficiency improvements to current internal combustion designs provide a partial forth alternative, although there are physical limits. The National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies finds efficiency improvements more promising than Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles (HFCVs) through about 2040. However, in combination with Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs) the possibilities are striking. 1 For instance, General Motors is currently hoping to begin selling PEVs with a 40 mile range in 2010. A 40-mile range is sufficient to cover 75 percent of the light-vehicle driving in the United States. Because the PEV is a hybrid, it will have increased efficiency; and, if used with a diesel engine, a doubling of efficiency should be easily achievable with present technology. This would result in roughly Taking a longer view, the complete elimination of fossil fuel use is eventually inevitable. At that point, trucks and automobiles will be powered by electricity\u2014from batteries or fuel cells\u2014and by biofuels. Electricity will likely be produced by wind turbines, solar energy and nuclear power. HFCVs will then require the production of hydrogen by electrolysis, or a high-temperature process with advanced nuclear reactors. Assuming 70% efficiency for electrolysis or a high temperature process, and 70% efficiency for the fuel cell, the latter being a rather optimistic value, yields 49% efficiency for the conversion of bulk electricity to on-board electricity. Of course this ignores the need to pressurize and transport the hydrogen. By contrast, charging and discharging a battery is over 90% efficient. For this reason, the long-run dominance of HFCV technology over battery technology looks unlikely. However, this conclusion could be reversed by the development of cheap artificial photosynthesis for the production of hydrogen. In the medium term, say between 2050 and 2075, hydrogen could possibly, although by no means certainly, dominate a combination of batteries, efficiency and biofuels. It should, however, be remembered that, unlike cellulosic ethanol and engine efficiency improvements, HFCVs will not automatically do much to reduce CO2 emissions. There must be an additional policy requiring carbon capture when hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels. At present, there is no case for tipping the balance towards a hydrogen transition. As the NRC explains, there is a \u201cdownside risk of pushing HFCVs (or any other specific technologies) before they are really ready or if they turn out not to be the best option, which could be extremely expensive and disruptive.\u201d There is also no proof that hydrogen is the most likely long-run solution. There exists, however, an excellent case for the present R&D effort in hydrogen technology. There is a modest chance that it could provide an enormous payoff. For example, it is possible that batteries and cellulosic ethanol will remain too expensive to be practical, and that breakthroughs in fuel-cell and hydrogen storage technologies will bring HFCVs to market sooner and more profitably than expected. And perhaps recent breakthroughs in artificial photosynthesis will eventually make solar-hydrogen the fuel of choice. Funding such high-risk advanced R&D is something the market does poorly. Because of this, the government should support hydrogen research, and quite likely at a higher level than the current one. That is the case for hydrogen. It is also the case for funding all of hydrogen\u2019s competitors, or as the NRC (2008b) says, taking a \u201cportfolio approach.\u201d an 87% reduction in gasoline use. That is considerably better than what the NRC predicts could be achieved by HFCVs by 2050 under its optimistic Case 1. 2 The situation does not seem to be clearer in the short run, between now and 2050. For instance, the NRC\u2019s (2008b) Conclusion 14 states that \u201cadvanced conventional vehicles and biofuels\u2014have the potential to provide significant reductions in projected oil imports and CO2 emissions. ... [but] the deepest cuts in oil use and CO2 emissions after about 2040 would come from hydrogen.\u201d But this conclusion has been weakened by assuming that the future will bring only advanced conventional vehicles or biofuels, but not both. In fact the NRC (2008b) reports (see Figures 6.29 and 6.30) what happens if both improvements are realized. In this case HFCVs do not provide deeper cuts in either oil or emissions until after 2050.

The workflow can conduct 3D static and 4D flow-, pressure-, and temperature-coupled calculations for rock deformations, failure and stresses. In highly heterogeneous and complex models, the workflow is capable of modelling multiple hundred faults, and multiple thousand discrete fractures. It allows the geological model, despite its high degree of complexity to be maintained throughout the geomechanical analyses process.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "8315b357d57a1cf53ff24c3d7d6f0cb35407bdfb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "569616367", "CorpusId": 137565221}, "title": "CO2-Abscheidung und -Ablagerung (Carbon Capture and Storage - CCS) in zivilrechtlicher Sicht", "abstract": null, "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "ec6047260236c5919383c9f98d23df590b4a409c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2777947396", "DOI": "10.4172/2157-7617-C1-036", "CorpusId": 135040775}, "title": "Development of policy strategy for carbon capture and storage; Case study based in Japan", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "e6b1e09c0e93bd5733a2774f07f9c81b94cc5de0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2508165355", "CorpusId": 113830944}, "title": "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (Appraisal Stage) - Development Carbon Capture and Storage in South Africa - P149521", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "f285018812bbe9b662e1cd9f7d1dc77aa3a25744", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2614216274", "CorpusId": 184980220}, "title": "CO2 Recovery Technology from Power Plants", "abstract": "It is now widely agreed that capturing CO 2 from flue gases and the subsequent injection into geological formations can significantly contribute to reducing CO 2 emissions, the principal greenhouse gas.

This is a necessary and important policy step, given the sector\u2019s substantial contribution to national emissions, rapid production and emissions growth projections. Yet our analysis and modelling suggests that the oil and gas sector has a limited ability to deliver emission intensity improvements between now and 2020. To ensure cost-effective policy and increase the level of ambition for achieving deeper emissions reductions, federal sector-by-sector GHG regulations should consider including compliance flexibility both within and beyond the sector. Federal lightand heavy-duty vehicle GHG regulations, as well as Alberta\u2019s Specified Gas Emitters Regulation (SGER), provide compliance flexibility blueprints from which to inform the emerging federal oil and gas GHG regulations. But stringency will need to be higher in order to move Canada towards achieving its 2020 GHG target of 607 megatonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (Mt CO2e). 1 Vice President, Climate, Energy and Partnerships, International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) 2 Associate, IISD and Principal, Sky Curve Consulting P1: Abstract P2: Pragmatic Regulatory Design for Oil and Gas GHGs P5: Approach P13: Designing Flexible Regulations for Oil and Gas P16: Reference List B.C.'s GGRTA 0.7 Mt 1% Alberta 3.5 Mt 3% EU ETS 81 Mt 80% NSW GGAS 15 Mt 14% State Power Rule (Oregon) 1.5 Mt 2% POLICY BRIEF OCTOBER 2012 Flexibility and Federal Oil and Gas Greenhouse Gas Regulations: Containing costs while increasing ambition 2 B.C.'s GGRTA 0.7 Mt 1% Alberta 3.5 Mt 3% EU ETS 81 Mt 80% NSW GGAS 15 Mt 14% State Power Rule (Oregon) 1.5 Mt 2% Pragmatic Regulatory Design for Oil and Gas GHGs A regulatory approach to driving GHG reductions does not need to be rigid and costly. Careful design can lead to more cost-effective\u2014and more ambitious\u2014regulations for reducing Canadian GHG emissions. While the lack of federal carbon pricing policy has been much lamented, we are now seeing federal GHG regulations move forward that include the most important element of carbon pricing\u2014flexibility. Both the light-duty vehicle regulations and the proposed heavy-duty vehicle regulations include elements of compliance transfers such as crediting and banking. This movement to hybrid performance regulations with elements of compliance flexibility is positive, as regulators seek to strike a balance between emissions reductions and competitiveness. While the current political reality has moved policy away from the economist\u2019s preferred \u201cfirst best\u201d carbon pricing, the sector-by-sector regulations do seem to be evolving toward increased flexibility, partially tempering the risks from rigid, prescriptive and potentially high-cost policy. Such pragmatic policy design is the focus of this policy brief. Building on the federal GHG sector-by-sector approach to regulating carbon, we explore the implications of developing flexible performance-based regulations for the oil and gas sector. We ask three simple questions to help inform the design of new performance-based regulations: 1. What flexibility mechanisms in existing GHG regulations might inform new oil and gas regulations? 2. How important is compliance flexibility to the oil and gas sector? 3. What flexibility mechanisms can be added to the oil and gas performance regulations to keep costs low while achieving emission reductions? Our approach to addressing these questions builds on IISD\u2019s previous work in the Regulating Carbon Emissions in Canada initiative.3 Specifically, in Mind the Gap (Sawyer, 2011), we identified five principles that should inform the design of performance-based regulations: 1. Establish certainty through a regulatory schedule that makes expected effort clear 2. Enable flexibility while achieving emissions reductions 3. Avoid disproportionate costs across emissions in Canada 4. Seek reductions throughout the entire emission inventory 5. Accommodate a transition to carbon pricing in the longer term These principles still hold, and our recommendations on the design of new federal oil and gas regulations are solidly embedded in this framework. We find that the movement in federal sector-by-sector GHG regulations to include more compliance flexibility is particularly important for the oil and gas sector, with an opportunity both to design costeffective regulations and to increase the level of ambition for achieving deeper emissions reductions. This policy brief focuses mainly on the 2020 time horizon and on emissions reductions that can contribute to Canada\u2019s 2020 target of 17 per cent below 2005 emissions levels. However, we recognize that longer-term emissions reductions also matter for Canada, given the long-lived capital stock now being deployed by the oil and gas sector, and so must 3 See www.iisd.org/climate/north_american/regulating_carbon.aspx B.C.'s GGRTA 0.7 Mt 1% Alberta 3.5 Mt 3% EU ETS 81 Mt 80% NSW GGAS 15 Mt 14% State Power Rule (Oregon) 1.5 Mt 2% POLICY BRIEF OCTOBER 2012 Flexibility and Federal Oil and Gas Greenhouse Gas Regulations: Containing costs while increasing ambition 3 B.C.'s GGRTA 0.7 Mt 1% Alberta 3.5 Mt 3% EU ETS 81 Mt 80% NSW GGAS 15 Mt 14% State Power Rule (Oregon) 1.5 Mt 2% also be considered in policy design. Finally, the oil and gas sector is defined in this report as both conventional and unconventional oil extraction, upgrading, natural gas extraction and petroleum refining. These sectors will likely be regulated under emerging federal oil and gas regulations. Flexibility Mechanisms in Existing GHG Regulations Regulatory policies for mitigating GHG emissions are a key part of Canada\u2019s current climate change policy landscape. The federal government in particular has begun to implement a sector-by-sector approach to GHG regulation. It has announced or enacted regulations in three sectors\u2014light-duty vehicles, coal-fired electricity generation and heavyduty vehicles\u2014and plans to announce regulations for the oil and gas extraction sector by 2013. Alberta has similarly relied on a regulatory framework, having had its SGER for industrial emitters in place since 2007. Yet a brief review of some of the details of each of these regulations illustrates that there isn\u2019t necessarily a clear-cut division between regulatory and market-based policy approaches. Existing regulations are already relying on flexibility mechanisms to contain costs. Federal Light-Duty Vehicle Regulations4 Canada\u2019s light-duty vehicle regulations require that for each model year 2011 and forward, the average GHG emissions from a given automobile manufacturer\u2019s fleet of new passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks meet\u2014on average\u2014a given standard for emissions per mile travelled. The regulatory standard does, however, include a number of flexibility mechanisms, because a company can obtain credits if its fleet\u2019s average emissions are lower than the regulated threshold. These credits can be used within the next five years of compliance with the regulation. Essentially, this is a banking mechanism. Manufacturers can choose to improve vehicle efficiency earlier, rather than later, if it is more cost-effective for them to do so. Companies can also transfer credits to other manufacturers. This trading mechanism allows the manufacturers that can most cost-effectively improve efficiency to do so, and those less equipped to purchase additional credits. Both of these flexibility mechanisms serve to decrease the total cost of compliance for the regulation, without affecting its impact on emissions reductions. These mechanisms align with our second and third principles for regulation. Banking allows flexibility across time, and trading allows flexibility across the regulated emissions, allowing firms to seek out the lowest cost options for emissions reductions. Federal Heavy-Duty Vehicle Regulations5 The proposed regulations for emissions from heavy-duty vehicles require progressively more stringent GHG emission standards for new on-road heavy-duty vehicles and engines for model years starting in 2014. The regulations apply to companies manufacturing and importing new on-road heavy-duty vehicles and engines for the purpose of sale in Canada. However, this proposed regulation also lays out a credit system. Similar to the light-duty vehicle regulations, manufacturers with vehicle fleets that fall below the required average level of emissions can obtain credits. These credits can be banked (used for compliance with subsequent model-year standards) or traded (sold to other manufacturers for 4 Information for this section is drawn from Government of Canada (2010). 5 Information for this section is drawn from Department of the Environment (2012).

Again, these mechanisms provide flexibility across time and across regulated emissions, providing firms with choice in how they can achieve the required emissions reductions at a lower cost. Federal Electricity Performance Standard The regulation for coal-fired generation of electricity sets a performance standard for new coal-fired units and those that have reached the end of their useful life (Government of Canada, 2012). It will phase out high-emitting coal-fired generation, requiring new capacity to be high-efficiency natural gas, renewable energy or fossil fuel-fired power with carbon capture and storage.

The CCUS process comprises four steps, namely: capture, compression, transport, utilization and storage. Capture technologies take three different forms: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture and oxy-fuel combustion. Compared to the other two technologies, post-combustion capture is relatively easier to implement, as it can be retrofitted for existing plants, because it does not require that radical changes to the plants be made [1]. Competing methods for post-combustion carbon capture include absorption, cryogenic fractionation and membrane-centered methods [2, 3]. Absorption processes are well-known and commonly used in the chemical industry. Thus, it is predicted that in the near future, chemical absorption using monoethanolamine (MEA) will play an essential role in capturing CO2 from flue gases in power plants [4]. Contending with chemical absorption, gas separation membranes offer advantages in their potential for less environmental impact, since an additional environmental externality is solvent degradation. Furthermore, membrane modules can be utilized as add-on equipment, requiring fewer modifications to power plants. The other potential advantage is that for low degrees of CO2 separation, a stage-arranged membrane system demands a lower specific energy than that required for MEA absorption [5, 6]. Correspondingly, many groups and researchers around the world are involved in the material and process development of this method. Although some processes [5, 7-9] have been explored with consideration to their energetic and economic aspects, no detailed simulation of the exhaust heat integration of the capture system with power plants has yet been performed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential for reducing the net efficiency decrease by means of an optimal integration of the CO2 capture process into a power plant. Two commercial simulation tools, EBSILON \u00ae Professional (power plant) and ASPEN Plus \u00ae (membrane capture process, CO2 compressor), are used. The model developed here is based on the study \u201cReference Power Plant North-Rhine-Westphalia\u201d (RPP-NRW) [10]. After SCR-DeNOx, dust removal (E-filter) and desulphurization (FGD), the flue gas has a pressure of approximately 1 atm and temperature of 50-70 oC. The Reference Power Plant NRW was designed to achieve a net efficiency of almost 46%. Ultra-supercritical steam conditions are characterized by 285 bar and 600 \u00b0C for the main steam, with 60 bar and 620 \u00b0C for the reheated steam conditions. Investigations into membrane-based, post-combustion CO2 capture process confirm that the process requires auxiliary power for vacuum pumps and compressors involved. These additional energy demands cause a decrease in the net efficiency of a power plant\u2019s operation.
