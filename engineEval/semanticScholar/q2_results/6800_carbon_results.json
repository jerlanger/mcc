Methods that are proposed to mitigate CO2 emissions include improving the energy conversion efficiency of fossil fuels, shifting energy production to low carbon sources, enhancing CO2 uptake by terrestrial and marine biomass and capturing CO2 and storing it deep underground. Of all the methods, carbon capture and storage (CCS) deep underground is the best way to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gases which is often responsible for global warming. One of the major issues faced when storing CO2 in depleted oil or gas reservoirs is its leakage through the injection wells. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) based well-cement has been used in these oil and gas wells. OPC, however, has issues such as cement degradation, leakage, strength reduction, and durability reduction when used in down-hole environments. Geopolymer can be a good alternative to OPC because of its excellent acid resistance characteristics, high strength and low shrinkage. In a typical wellbore, wellcement will be exposed to saline water that can have different salinity levels. Hence, the main aim of this study was to compare the mechanical behaviours of OPC and geopolymer cement cured in saline water for 7, 28 and 45 days at different salinity levels (0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % of NaCl). A series of experiments were conducted to compare the compressive strength and Young\u2019s modulus of OPC and geopolymer. It was observed that the compressive strength of OPC based well-cement increases as the salinity level of the brine water is increased up to 10 % NaCl and that it thereafter decreases as the NaCl percentage is further increased. On the other hand, the compressive strength of geopolymer well-cement generally increases as the brine concentration is increased. Based on the findings of this research, it can be concluded that geopolymer as a well-cement can perform better in saline water than OPC based well-cement, and that therefore geopolymer is suitable as a primary well-cement material.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "339c39a60311c39cb5795829bf3d264ac64570c4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2884311522", "CorpusId": 134678687}, "title": "\ubbf8\uad6d \ud658\uacbd\ubcf4\ud638\uccad(EPA)\uc758 \uc774\uc0b0\ud654\ud0c4\uc18c \uc9c0\uc911\uc800\uc7a5 \uaddc\uce59\uacfc \uadf8 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810", "abstract": "The process of carbon dioxide capture and storage(afterwards 'CCS') is composed of a series of life cycle such as capture, transportation and storage.

From the fourth IPCC assessment (Alley et al. 2007) and the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA 2004), we now know that the deep oceans have accumulated 22 times more heat than has the atmosphere, ice melt is accelerating, wind patterns are shifting (that\u2019s particularly ominous), and nonlinear surprises are very likely in store for the climate system and for the impacts on systems such as forests and coral reefs (Epstein and Mills 2005; Stern 2006). The implications for public health and well-being are daunting, as illustrated in articles throughout this month\u2019s Environews section. \n \nWith weather turbulence turning heads on Wall Street, an emerging evangelical voice calling for \u201ccreation care,\u201d the specter of \u201cpeak oil,\u201d and a barrage of energy bills mounting Capitol Hill (the U.S. Congress), we appear to be on the verge of really taking the first steps toward confronting our energy budget. The goal of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases requires a 60\u201380% reduction of emissions over the coming few decades. \n \nWhat follows are some considerations for crafting a comprehensive plan and some financial and policy instruments for implementation. Comparing life-cycle costs\u2014the health, ecologic, and economic dimension\u2014of proposed solutions can help differentiate safe solutions from those warranting further study, and from those with risks prohibiting wide-scale adoption. Solutions meeting multiple goals merit high ratings. \n \nEnergy conservation (demand side management) is clearly the first place to start. \u201cSmart\u201d urban growth; a smart grid (with optimizing meters and switches); hybrid vehicles; heat capture from utilities or \u201ccogeneration\u201d (two-thirds of produced energy is lost as heat); \u201cgreen buildings\u201d; and walking, biking, and improving public transport can get us halfway there\u2014and save money. \n \nDistributed generation (DG)\u2014power produced near the point of use\u2014with solar, wind, wave, geothermal heat pumps, and fuel cells can be fed into grids where they exist and, via \u201cnet metering\u201d regulations, generate income for the individual producer. Where energy is scarce and grids are few, stand-alone systems\u2014augmented with human power and stored in improved batteries\u2014can pump water, irrigate fields, power clinics, light homes, cook food, and drive development. Clean DG also improves resilience in the face of more weather extremes (i.e., adaptation to climate change), reduces carbon emissions (i.e., prevention or mitigation of climate change), stimulates green industries, and creates jobs. \n \nBiofuels hold a great deal of promise. However, converting corn to ethanol means less corn for animals and us, and may yield no net energy gain. Sugar ferments without adding energy (yeast suffices). But large plantations can deplete soils and groundwater and, in the Amazon, sugar for alcohol is pushing land clearing for soybean production deeper into the rainforest. In Indonesia, monoculture plantations of trees that produce palm oil are transforming and degrading vast swaths of prime forest, setting the stage for spreading fires and releasing biologically stored carbon from trees and peat. Cellulosic conversion of range grasses by microbe-generated enzymes may work, but land considerations still hold; recycling farm waste and garbage may yield the best results overall. \n \nBuilding green buildings with healthy surroundings will create a critical syzygy, aligning clean energy production with sustainable forestry (e.g., bamboo) and green chemistry (which avoids petrolbased carcinogens in the manufacture of carpets, paints, furniture, fertilizers, and pesticides). \n \nWhile it is unrealistic to think we can meet all of our energy needs without some fossil fuel use, natural gas is the cleanest burning and may be the best back-up source during the transition. Also, hydrogen gas (H2) can be separated from natural gas or methane (CH4) to use in fuel cells. \n \nTo implement such changes in our energy use, distribution, storage, and generation, corporations can change their products and practices (and many large ones, such as GE and Alcoa, have begun doing so). Financial institutions (e.g., bankers, insurers, managers of mutual and state pension funds) often have the longest time-line perspectives. Finance can be thought of as the central nervous system of the global economy: It is feeling the pain of huge losses from weather extremes, with insured losses rising from $400 million a year in the 1980s to $83 billion in 2005 (Epstein and Mills 2005), and they are cogitating on their response. Enlightened, self-interested actions of investors and insurers\u2014through requirements for loans, influence on building codes, and reduced premiums for proactive directors and officers of firms, for example\u2014could ripple through the entire global economy. \n \nGovernments must provide the incentives and create the infrastructure for the new economy. Credits for \u201cclean tech\u201d industries, progressive procurement practices (e.g., for hybrid fleets), and tax benefits for commercial models that defray upfront capital costs are among the incentives needed to launch infant industries and drive market shifts. Aligning rules, regulations, and rewards\u2014and dismantling the enormous financial and bureaucratic disincentives\u2014can help erect the necessary scaffolding for the low carbon economy. \n \nFinally, the United States must sign the Kyoto Protocol (United Nations 1998). Under its umbrella, we can help create a substantive global fund for adaptation and mitigation that can make the clean energy transition a \u201cwin\u2013win\u2013win\u201d for energy, the environment, and the global economy.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "f534dd3e16ae5dd9a0b9012cfa5ab4c0053807be", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.22617/tcs210260", "CorpusId": 242268784}, "title": "Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage Game Changers: A Compendium of Technologies and Enablers", "abstract": "This compendium showcases new and innovative low carbon technologies that have potential to be deployed in Asia and the Pacific.

One of the most vexing issues in connection with a cap-and-trade system is the difficulty in predicting the resulting market price for CO 2 emission permits. This price would be the effective carbon tax imposed on the world\u2019s economies. Critics of cap-and-trade regulation argue that, barring technological breakthroughs, the effective carbon tax could reach levels that would severely injure all energy intensive sectors of the economy. Such predictions are too dire. In fact, we estimate substantial reductions in CO 2 emissions could be achieved at a marginal cost in the range of $25 \u2013 $30 per metric ton (\u2018tonne\u2019). The imposition of a cap-and-trade system is likely to spawn a range of alternative CO 2 abatement strategies. Among these, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) at fossil fuel power plants is not only within technological reach, but current engineering estimates also suggest that it will be a cost-effective approach for eliminating most of the emissions from coal and natural gas power plants. Since power generation currently accounts for a sizeable share of the overall \u2018emissions pie,\u2019 CCS is bound to have a major role in limiting the effective carbon tax under a capand-trade system. At the same time, the availability of CCS technology puts a sharp upper bound on the expected increase in electricity prices. In turn, this will make CCS beneficial for other sectors of the economy which, once carbon emissions are priced, will have incentives to switch to electric power for their energy needs.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "7feb1e4c74f78f016d43d2db201207bf4f0600b2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2352986924", "CorpusId": 130444770}, "title": "Brief Talk on Ways of Carbon Dioxide Emission Reduction in China", "abstract": "Based on analyzing the ways of carbon dioxide emission reduction,the potentiality of carbon emission reduction in China is specified in the aspects of energy saving and energy structure change and carbon capture storage.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "7c9591eb0b1e039ffc36c5a63254870f10e705d2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3174084104", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3812570", "CorpusId": 237975520}, "title": "Update on post-combustion carbon capture and storage on LNG fuelled vessels", "abstract": "The maritime industry has set clear objectives towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decades.

This is done by discussing the results of the DerisCO2 project where CO2 capture on the LNG fuelled Sleipnir vessel from Heerema Marine Contractors is analysed. One of the main advantages of SBCC is the heat integration of the vessel and the capture plant, which drastically decreases the heat and electricity demand of the capture plant and the total capture costs become fully CAPEX dominated. Taking into account the operational profile of the Sleipnir vessel, a conceptual design is proposed which consists of four absorbers and a single desorber, which is able to capture 72.5% of the CO2 emissions over the whole sailing profile. The total cost of CO2 capture, liquefaction and on-board storage for the Sleipnir vessel is estimated at 115 \u20ac/ton CO2, where the variable OPEX is estimated at 5.7% of the total costs. Lastly, the results of the tilting table experiments in the DerisCO2 project are discussed, where the effect of vessel tilting at sea on CO2 absorption is analysed.

Most of us knew that photosynthesis is the process whereby plants and certain bacteria have used sunlight as a source of energy to split water to create energy fro the production of food (starches) with the addition of atmospheric carbon dioxide, while producing atmospheric oxygen. Our policy makers seem to think that only plants will ever 'do' photosynthesis. This is a bit like the men at the end of the 19th century who were convinced that only birds could \u2018do\u2019 controlled flight. If they were alive today their solution for long distance air travel might be to genetically engineer huge homing pigeons, capable of carrying passengers on their back. Artificial photosynthesis began in the Cold War. It really was part of what was known in the 'Dr Stangelove' film as the 'mine-shaft' gap, part of the plan to enhance the capacity of the United States to keep its politicians, senior industrial and military people alive during a nuclear winter. Although artificial photosynthesis on some definitions includes synthetic biology (for example the genetic engineering of bacetria to produce lipid-based fuels) its core research involves nanoscale engineering. The nanoscale involves manipulating matter at the level of about a billionth of a metre, it involves making objects atom by atom. Some examples of how nanotechnology is already improving the light capture, electron transport and water splitting and energy storage aspects of artificial photosynthesis will be presented later. Perhaps the most significant aspect of artificial photosynthesis is the prospect that nanotechnology may allow the global domestic production of cheap, 'off-grid' solar fuels and food. With timely and coordinated government, academic, corporate encouragement, artificial photosynthesis may become a global phenomenon, deriving inexpensive, local (household and community) generation of fuels and basic foods from simple raw materials \u2013 sunlight, water and carbon dioxide \u2013 just like plants do, only better. One way governance principles (such as those derived from international human rights) can assist this process is by assisting to create the normative architecture for a Global Artificial Photosynthesis project (GAP) (or Global Solar Fuels and Foods (GSF)) project. Such a macroscience GAP or GSF project can be regarded as the moral culmination of nanotechnology.

To verify that this storage is effective and that CO2 is not migrating to the near surface and seeping out of the ground, resulting in potential health, safety, and environmental risks, monitoring of storage sites will be necessary. Numerical simulations of leakage and seepage have shown that CO2 concentrations in the shallow subsurface can reach relatively high levels even for modest leakage rates; however, once CO2 seeps into the atmospheric surface layer, winds are effective at dispersing the CO2. Geologic CO2 storage reservoirs will be chosen in large part for their low probability of CO2 leakage away from the target formation within hundred to thousand year time scales. Therefore, CO2 storage verification will involve searching for potential anomalies, likely of small magnitude, over tens of km or more within a system with large spatial and temporal variation of CO2 fluxes and concentrations arising from natural biological and hydrologic processes. A range of technologies exists to measure CO2 concentrations and fluxes in the shallow subsurface and the atmospheric surface layer. These technologies include (1) the infrared gas analyzer (IRGA) for measurement of point CO2 concentrations, (2) the accumulation chamber (AC) technique to measure point soil CO2 fluxes, (3) the eddy covariance (EC) method to measure net CO2 flux over a given area, and (4) light distancing and ranging (LIDAR) to measure CO2 concentrations over an integrated path. However, these technologies alone cannot solve the fundamental problem of discerning a small CO2 leakage or seepage signal (LOSS) from the naturally varying background CO2 fluxes and concentrations. Here, we describe the primary sources of background CO2 in the near surface and the processes that control the natural variability of concentrations and fluxes of this CO2. We then propose an integrated measurement, monitoring, and modeling strategy designed to meet the challenge of detecting a small CO2 LOSS within this variability. Controls on Background Fluxes and Concentrations. We define \u201cbackground\u201d CO2 as CO2 derived primarily from the atmosphere and biologically mediated oxidation of organic carbon. Background soil CO2 fluxes and concentrations are dependent on CO2 production in the soil, movement of CO2 from sub-soil sources into the soil, and exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere as controlled by concentration (diffusion) and pressure (advection) gradients. Table 1 shows generalized chemical and isotopic signatures related to different background sources of CO2. Biologically produced CO2 in soils (i.e., soil respiration) is derived from root respiration and decay of organic matter. While many factors may influence soil respiration rates, changes in atmospheric and soil temperature and soil moisture have been shown to strongly affect these rates and related concentrations and fluxes. CO2 that enters soil from sub-soil sources can be derived from groundwater degassing of CO2 derived from respiration, atmospheric, and carbonate mineral sources. Also, production of CO2 at sub-soil depths can occur by oxidative decay of relatively young or ancient (e.g., peat, lignite, kerogen) organic matter in the vadose zone. Exchange of soil CO2 from subsurface sources with the atmosphere can occur by diffusion and/or advection. Diffusive flow depends on the gas production rate and soil temperature, moisture and properties such as porosity, with each of these factors varying in both space and time. Advective flow can be driven by fluctuations in atmospheric pressure, wind, temperature, and rainfall.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "d9e42f509d5dce689444deef0030094c8faf8a78", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3016588749", "DOI": "10.2172/1171662", "CorpusId": 227000805}, "title": "From Fundamental Understanding To Predicting New Nanomaterials For High Capacity Hydrogen/Methane Storage and Carbon Capture", "abstract": "Use neutron scattering methods along with first\u2022 principles computation to achieve fundamental understanding of the chemical and structural interactions governing the storage and release of hydrogen/methane and carbon capture in a wide spectrum of candidate materials.

Scott | Abstract: Greenhouse gas emissions and water usage are two major concerns in the power generation sector. Advanced clean coal technologies (i.e., solid sorbent CO2 capture technologies and combined wet/dry cooling system) are promising for future central power generation in order to achieve sustainable, secure, and efficient system performance. This dissertation describes research associated with advanced coal derived clean power generation, from near-term pulverized coal (PC) power plant strategies retrofitted for CO2 capture, to long-term integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power generation, to co-production IGCC with carbon capture and storage (CCS) co-fueled by coal and biomass.In this study, the post-combustion solid sorbent based CO2 capture system for the PC power plant is optimized for integration in order to minimize plant modifications and the associated downtime. Due to significantly less steam usage in sorbent regeneration, the PC plant with advanced solid sorbent CO2 capture has better performance and lower cost of electricity than the plant using conventional amine scrubbing technology. By employing a combined wet/dry cooling system, the PC plant with CO2 capture reduces water usage significantly, while the performance and water usage are a function of ambient conditions as predicted by a mathematical model, the latter of which is validated by experimental data from the literature. Pre-combustion solid sorbent based CO2 capture technologies used in the IGCC are evaluated by systems analysis and compared to SelexolTM CO2 capture. Compared with the SelexolTM approach, solid sorbent CO2 capture results in a power plant with significantly higher overall plant efficiency and more attractive economics.Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation models were developed for both solid sorbent CO2 capture alone, and combined water gas shift (WGS) and solid sorbent CO2 capture in the IGCC applications. ANSYS FLUENT and User Defined Functions (UDF) were the resources adopted to incorporate the fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, water vaporization, adsorption equilibrium and kinetics, and WGS reaction kinetics . The CFD models were validated by experimental data, and applied to commercial size fixed bed reactor designs and simulations. It was found that (1) the CO2 breakthrough time or CO2 loading capacity is independent of reactor geometry as long as the space velocity is constant, (2) the adsorption rate is the rate controlling step for CO2 capture using solid sorbent, and (3) break through occurs before the solid sorbent near the exit of the bed is fully utilized due to bulk transfer of the CO2 in the axial direction. However, a low space velocity can increase the loading of the sorbent. The CFD approach also assists in the design of effective thermal management strategies for the reactor in the case of combined WGS and solid sorbent CO2 capture.Co-feeding of biomass along with coal and the co-production of H2 and synthetic fuels in IGCCs is evaluated for future clean coal power generation.

Gas will play an increasing role in electricity generation, which will continue growing at a faster rate than overall energy demand. The successful deployment of cleaner, more efficient technologies is expected to help coal retain its importance.

However, the development of sustainable subsurface energy technologies such as water efficient hydrocarbon recovery and geologic carbon storage need to be grounded in a fundamental scientific understanding of dynamic reactive fluid-induced chemo-morphological changes in heterogeneous materials representative of subsurface environments. Latest advancements in multi-scale X-ray scattering which encompass Ultra-Small, Small, and Wide Angle X-Ray Scattering (USAXS/SAXS/WAXS) and very Small Angle Neutron Scattering (vSANS) measurements combined with complementary analytical techniques now allow us to dynamically determine the structural and morphological changes as geochemically active fluids interact with materials representative of surface environments.

The soils that store large quantities of carbonates play an important role in global carbon cycle. Calcareous soils of India occupy an area of 228.8 m ha and cover 69.4% of the total geographical area (TGA) and spread over 38 out of 60 agro-ecological subregions, and the SIC stock is around 33.94Pg in the first 0\u20131.5 m depth. The SIC stock is mainly due to pedogenic formation of CaCO3 (PC) in semi-arid tropical (SAT) soils, which reduces crop productivity. The SOC stock (in the first 0\u20130.3 m depth) is more than double (9.55Pg) than SIC (4.14Pg). This suggests that the shallow-rooted agricultural crops enhance OC concentration in the rooting zones by preventing the rapid formation of PC, which is an important factor in rainfed agriculture in SAT environments. Current productivity of farmers\u2019 fields in the rainfed tropics is two- to fourfold lower than the achievable crop yields. The arid and semi-arid environments cover more than 50% of the total geographical area of India, and the soils under such areas are, by and large, used for rainfed agriculture. In dry climates the primary pedogenic process is the calcification, which deprives soils of Ca ions both in solution and on exchange complex. Due to the lack of adequate Ca ions, both physical and chemical properties of soils are modified and cause reduction in crop yield. However, in view of the present soil productivity of calcareous SAT soils as evidenced from their support in India\u2019s growing self-sufficiency in food production and food stocks since independence, a critical review is warranted to establish whether SIC is a useless C reserve and has no role in soil ecosystem services during the cultural practices of agricultural crops, under forest and natural grassland cover. The presence of PC is common in major soil types of semi-arid tropical (SAT) in India (alluvial soils of the Indo-Gangetic Plains, IGP, red ferruginous soils and shrink-swell soils). The formation of PC in the arid climate enhances the pH and also the relative abundance of Na+ ions on soil exchange sites and in the solution; and the Na+ ions in turn cause dispersion of the fine clay particles. The dispersed fine clays translocate in major soil types of India as the formation of PC creates a Na+-enriched chemical environment conducive for the deflocculation of clay particles and their subsequent movement downward. Therefore, the formation of PC and the clay illuviation are two concurrent and contemporary pedogenetic events, resulting in an increase in relative proportion of sodium, causing increased sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP) and pH values with depth. These pedogenetic processes continue to represent a pedogenic threshold during the dry climates of the Holocene. Thus, the formation of PC is a basic natural degradation process, induced by tectonic-climate-linked events, which exhibits the regressive pedogenesis by capturing atmospheric CO2 and also immobilizes C in unavailable form in soils. This pedogenic process results in substantial retardation of the emission of CO2 from both cultivated and noncultivated SAT soils and also supports the recent world views on no positive role of anthropogenic CO2 increase in the global warming phenomenon.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "f4198a9c040259c738ceab63699ca114b09c5085", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.2118/209297-ms", "CorpusId": 248276239}, "title": "Economic Modeling of Carbon Capture and Sequestration Projects Utilizing Re-Purposed Onshore California Wells and Infrastructure", "abstract": "\n At present, approximately 37,000 out of 110,000 oil and gas wells in onshore California are classified as \u2018idle\u2019 - they have not been producing hydrocarbon or water, including EOR, for two consecutive years without abandonment. In this context, we examine whether operators retaining those current or potentially future idle wells could economically re-purpose their assets for a carbon storage operation. Such an approach would potentially defer the eventual decommissioning, abandonment, and remediation costs of these assets.\n This study models the economics of a fully integrated system from source CO2 capture through subsurface storage for a thermal steam operation. The model workflow developed in this paper is as follows: capture carbon dioxide from steam co-generation plants in heavy oil steam injection fields in the San Joaquin Valley, delivering it via pipeline to selected idle producing or injection wells, converting those wells into carbon dioxide injectors, and finally injecting and monitoring for sequestration. The well re-purposing process would isolate the formerly produced hydrocarbon interval and re-complete in the overlying saline aquifer interval to be used for CO2 sequestration.\n The fundamental difference of project economics between hydrocarbon production and carbon capture and sequestration is the regulatory and policy-defined financial incentives. In California, those consist of three major elements: Section 45Q tax credits by the federal government, low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS) credit by the State of California, and cap-and-trade emission allowances. The economic model shows that two factors, LCFS credit price and the cost of carbon capture systems, comprise the most significant proportion of impact on economic feasibility. To achieve the breakeven IRR of 10%, first, LCFS eligibility of the CCS project for a co-generation plant should be improved, and credit price needs to remain at least at the current level. On top of that, the expected increase in future LCFS credit prices and cap-and-trade allowance as potential revenue in an opportunity cost context would enhance economic performance. Secondly, the most plausible, the CAPEX of carbon capture systems at steam co-generation plants would need to be reduced to the lowest cost benchmarks currently seen in process plant implementations.\n This paper can be viewed as a starting point to stimulate examination of carbon capture and sequestration project options by both operators managing end-of-field life producing assets, as well as State of California regulatory agencies pursuing carbon reduction as part of the state's larger energy transition strategy.", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "eb19731fecc94aaa8f873acc4ff59bec6a44d695", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 227080697}, "title": "Deep decarbonisation of the German industry via electricity or gas? A scenariobased comparison of pathways", "abstract": "The industry sector accounts for about 20 % of GHG emissions in Germany. Achieving long-term GHG neutrality also requires industrial emissions to approach zero in the long-term. The German government set an intermediate industry sector target in the range of 49 to 51 % emission reduction by 2030 compared to 1990. While the targets are set, it is yet mostly unclear which technology path industry will and can take towards decarbonisation. Various measures including energy efficiency, biomass, electrification, green hydrogen, power to gas (PtG), circularity, material efficiency, process switch and carbon capture and storage are on the table, but their individual contributions are highly debated. We present results of a comprehensive bottom-up assessment comparing two alternative scenario pathways to 2050. The first is based on electrification as the main decarbonisation option, while the second builds on the broad availability of green gas. We use the bottom model FORECAST, which contains a high level of technology and process detail. E.g. more than 60 energy-intensive processes/products are included as well as a detailed stock model of steam generation technologies. Results show that both scenarios reach a GHG reduction of about 93 % in 2050 without using carbon-capture and storage. Remaining emissions are mostly process-related. This requires a fundamental change in industrial energy supply and use, but also in the industrial structure including entire value chains. The electrification scenario experiences an increase of direct use of electricity of about 100 TWh or 50 % by 2050 compared to 2015 plus additional 146 TWh green hydrogen. In the gas focused scenario electricity demand remains stable, while a demand for 337 TWh of green gas emerges by 2050, mainly replacing natural gas use, but also coal in the steel industry and feedstocks in chemical products. Both scenarios assume a substantial improvement in\u2013 energy efficiency and material efficiency along the value chain for CO2-intensive products as well as a strong shift to a circular economy. E.g. the secondary steel route gains market share from about 30 % in 2015 to 60 % in 2050. In the basic materials industries a process switch to low-carbon production routes takes place assuming the market introduction and fast diffusion of low-carbon technologies, which are today only at pilot or demonstration scale. In addition, the electrification scenario also requires a carbon source for the hydrogen-based olefine production. Here, we assess the option to use remaining process-related CO2 emissions from lime and cement plants. Such fundamental change in the industrial structure can only happen when the regulatory frame is adapted and addresses the major challenges ahead. Among these are for example the higher running costs of CO2-neutral processes, the expansion of infrastructure, the effective implementation of CO2 price signals along the value chains and the reduction of uncertainties regarding large strategic investments in low-carbon processes.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "b3ddb90a89d5696d0df42f5b205b52eb3bfac232", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2615958338", "CorpusId": 134321870}, "title": "Influence of carbon capture and storage on the microbial ecosystem in a depleted oil reservoir", "abstract": "Deep subsurface petroleum reservoirs are candidate sites for carbon capture and storage (CCS). The feasibility of CCS has been mainly studied from a geological perspective. However, little is known about the effects of CO2 storage on microbes inhabiting the reservoirs. In this study, we investigated the effects of the elevated CO2 concentration on the methanogenic microbial community and function in a high-temperature petroleum reservoir by high-pressure incubation experiments mimicking the in situ reservoir (55\u00b0C, 5 MPa) or CO2 storage conditions. The microcosms were constructed using the production water and crude oil, pressurized with either N2 or N2+CO2 (90:10) at 5 MPa and then incubated at 55 \u00b0C. Methane production was observed with the decrease of acetate included in the production water under both high and low CO2 conditions. However, the stable isotope tracer experiments and molecular biological analyses for both microcosms showed that the major methanogenic pathway under the in situ reservoir condition was acetate oxidation coupled with hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, whereas acetoclastic methanogenesis occurred under the CO2 storage condition. Based on thermodynamic calculations, the change to acetoclastic methanogenesis by the increase in CO2 partial pressure was energetically more favorable than acetate oxidation. These results clearly indicated that CO2 storage into a high-temperature petroleum reservoir would cause a drastic change in the methanogenic pathways. Importantly, the elevated CO2 concentration invokes the faster and more favorable methanogenic pathway (acetoclastic methanogenesis) for crude oil biodegradation.

The power generation sector is largely based on fossil fuels and produces a significant share of the global CO2 emissions. Thus, new power generation processes with drastically reduced CO2 emissions need to be employed to mitigate global warming. Two alternatives which may be part of the solution is the replacement of coal with biomass or to apply the concept of carbon capture and storage (CCS). In CCS the CO2 is captured and processed on site and thereafter transported to a storage location. Oxy-fuel combustion, which has been studied in this thesis, has been demonstrated in large-scale pilot plants (30-60 MW). This work investigates the possibilities to co-combust biomass and coal in oxy-fuel combustion for CO2 capture. Biomass combined with CO2 capture has the potential to contribute to negative CO2 emissions. However, the high temperature corrosion (HTC) and the related K-Cl-S chemistry need to be studied in detail in order to determine the potential consequences for corrosion on heat transfer surfaces. This, since the use of biomass in power generation is problematic due to the relative high content of alkali (mainly potassium) and chlorine. Together these compounds form KCl, a salt which causes corrosive deposits and subsequent problems with so called high temperature corrosion (HTC). When sulphur is present, alkali sulphates may form instead of alkali chlorides. Sulphates have a higher melting point and causes less problems with corrosion and sulphates are therefore preferred instead of chlorides.\nThe work in this thesis is based on experiments performed in a 100 kW combustion unit and modelling of chemical kinetics. Both the experimental and modelling results show that a high SOX concentration is preferable to achieve as high degree of sulphation of the alkali chlorides. In oxy-fuel combustion, the SOX concentration is typically high due to flue gas recycling, which enables almost complete potassium sulphation in some of the studied oxy-combustion atmospheres. This makes oxy-fuel combustion an attractive process for co-combustion of coal and biomass, since alkali chloride formation to large extent may be suppressed. In addition, the effect of KCl on the CO oxidation process has been studied in air-fuel and oxy-fuel environments. The results show that KCl can promote CO-oxidation in a CO2 rich environment. However, no change could be observed for the total burnout time even though the CO concentration was decreased.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "be922da9ed377ec98036440c06371756075dceb0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2480050531", "CorpusId": 100092651}, "title": "Kostnaden f\u00f6r CCS vid Cementa AB i Degerhamn", "abstract": "CCS, Carbon Capture and Storage, innebar infangning och lagring av koldioxid fran stora punktutslapp. Detta gor cementindustrin aktuell for implementering av CCS.

The project comprises 15 countries representing more than 70% of global greenhouse gas emissions and is convened under the auspices of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN) and the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI). The report presents an illustrative deep decarbonisation pathway for Australia \u2013 just one of many possible pathways \u2013 developed using a combination of well-established modelling tools to identify feasible and least-cost options. The frame of reference for the analysis is that all countries decarbonise by 2050, consistent with the objective of limiting the increase in global mean surface temperature to 2\u00b0C in order to avoid dangerous climate change. This work finds that Australia can achieve net zero emissions by 2050 and live within its recommended carbon budget, using technologies that exist today, while maintaining economic prosperity. Major technological transitions are needed in some industries and many activities, but no fundamental change to Australia\u2019s economy is required. Economic activity and Australian incomes keep rising. The economy grows by 150% to 2050, while net emissions fall to zero and energy sector emissions are reduced by more than four fifths. Decarbonisation of energy systems in all countries relies on three pillars: ambitious energy efficiency; low carbon electricity; and electrification and fuel switching. For Australia there is a fourth pillar: reducing non-energy emissions in industry and agriculture. In the illustrative pathway, ambitious energy efficiency in all sectors leads to a halving of the final energy intensity of the economy between now and 2050. Low carbon electricity is supplied by renewable energy or a mix of renewable energy and either CCS or nuclear power. Electricity prices increase at moderate rates and then stabilise and are more than offset by the savings in electricity from energy efficiency, so average household electricity bills decline over time (not taking into account switching cars and heating to electricity). Emissions from transport, industry and buildings are hugely reduced through energy efficiency and switching from fossil fuels to carbon-free electricity and biofuels or gas. Remaining energy emissions are 3.0 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per person at 2050, with about half of this attributable to production for export. Non-energy emissions from industry are reduced through substitution with less emissions-intensive materials, process improvements and carbon capture and storage in some applications. Agriculture emissions are reduced through best practice farming and increased carbon forestry compensates for all remaining emissions at 2050. The agriculture and forestry sector maintains a similar share of GDP as today, as do the mining and manufacturing industries, with the exception of coal, oil and petroleum. The technologies required for decarbonisation are currently available or under development. Ongoing commercialisation, enhancement and integration will improve their cost-competitiveness and performance. Experience with technological change, such as the rapid fall in costs of solar cells seen in recent years, suggests that there will be positive surprises along the way. The analysis shows that deep decarbonisation requires neither substantial lifestyle changes nor large changes in Australia\u2019s economic structure. Australia retains its international advantage in primary industries, including mining and agriculture. While some technologies and activities decline, others expand and contribute to continued economic growth. The largest changes occur in the energy and land sectors. Australia\u2019s rich renewable energy resources could make it an energy superpower in a world where clean energy dominates. Together with substantial potential for geological sequestration and vast land available for carbon forestry, this creates economic opportunities for Australia in a decarbonised world. Achieving deep decarbonisation in this way by mid-century as outlined in this report \u2013 within the timeframe required to limit global warming to 2\u00b0C \u2013 would be a significant transition for Australia, and such a transition needs to be well managed. The experience with previous episodes of far-reaching economic change \u2013 such as the transition from agriculture to mining as a dominant factor in exports, as well as the rise of Australia\u2019s service industry \u2013 has shown the flexibility, adaptability and resilience of Australia\u2019s economy.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "eb42f1cbb7b71b1371186737263ed973d434d2ca", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2971846820", "DOI": "10.2172/821856", "CorpusId": 223088686}, "title": "Analysis of Devonian Black Shales in Kentucky for Potential Carbon Dioxide Sequestration and Enhanced Natural Gas Production Quarterly Report: January-March 2004", "abstract": "CO{sub 2} emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels have been linked to global climate change. Proposed carbon management technologies include geologic sequestration of CO{sub 2}. A possible, but untested, sequestration strategy is to inject CO{sub 2} into organic-rich shales. Devonian black shales underlie approximately two-thirds of Kentucky and are thicker and deeper in the Illinois and Appalachian Basin portions of Kentucky than in central Kentucky. The Devonian black shales serve as both the source and trap for large quantities of natural gas; total gas in place for the shales in Kentucky is estimated to be between 63 and 112 trillion cubic feet. Most of this natural gas is adsorbed on clay and kerogen surfaces, analogous to methane storage in coal beds. In coals, it has been demonstrated that CO{sub 2} is preferentially adsorbed, displacing methane. Black shales may similarly desorb methane in the presence of CO{sub 2}. The concept that black, organic-rich Devonian shales could serve as a significant geologic sink for CO{sub 2} is the subject of current research. To accomplish this investigation, drill cuttings and cores were selected from the Kentucky Geological Survey Well Sample and Core Library. Methane and carbon dioxide adsorption analyses are being performed to determine the gas-storage potential of the shale and to identify shale facies with the most sequestration potential. In addition, sidewall core samples are being acquired to investigate specific black-shale facies, their potential CO{sub 2} uptake, and the resulting displacement of methane. Advanced logging techniques (elemental capture spectroscopy) are being investigated for possible correlations between adsorption capacity and geophysical log measurements. For the Devonian shale, average total organic carbon is 3.71 percent (as received) and mean random vitrinite reflectance is 1.16. Measured adsorption isotherm data range from 37.5 to 2,077.6 standard cubic feet of CO{sub 2} per ton (scf/ton) of shale. At 500 psia, adsorption capacity of the Lower Huron Member of the shale is 72 scf/ton.

Despite the benefits, there have been a limited number of projects solely for CO2 sequestration being implemented. The industry is well-versed in gas injection in reservoir formation for pressure maintenance and improving oil recovery. However, there are striking differences between the injection of CO2 into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and the engineered storage of CO2. The differences and challenges are compounded when the storage site is karstified carbonate in offshore and bulk storage volume.\n It is paramount to know upfront that CO2 can be stored at a potential storage site and demonstrate that the site can meet required storage performance safety criteria. Comprehensive screening for site selection has been carried out for suitable CO2 storage sites in offshore Sarawak, Malaysia using geographical, geological, geophysical, geomechanical and reservoir engineering data and techniques for evaluating storage volume, container architecture, pressure, and temperature conditions. The site-specific input data are integrated into static and dynamic models for characterization and generating performance scenarios of the site. In addition, the geochemical interaction of CO2 with reservoir rock has been studied to understand possible changes that may occur during/after injection and their impact on injection processes/mechanisms. Novel 3-way coupled modelling of dynamic-geochemistry-geomechanics processes were carried out to study long-term dynamic behaviour and fate of CO2 in the formation.\n The 3-way coupled modelling helped to understand the likely state of injectant in future and the storage mechanism, i.e., structural, solubility, residual, and mineralized trapping. It also provided realistic storage capacity estimation, incorporating reservoir compaction and porosity/permeability changes. The study indicates deficient localized plastic shear strain in overburden flank fault whilst all the other flaws remained stable. The potential threat of leakage is minimal as target injection pressure is set at initial reservoir pressure, which is much lower than caprock breaching pressure during injection. Furthermore, it was found that the geochemical reaction impact is shallow and localized at the top of the reservoir, making the storage safe in the long term. The integrity of existing wells was evaluated for potential leakage and planned for a proper mitigation plan. Comprehensive measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) were also designed using state-of-art tools and dynamic simulation results.

With respect to fluidized bed combustion, OxyFuel has been investigated e.g. by Alstom [1] and results from pilot test rigs have been recently reported by Czakiert et al. [2]. The main advantage of fluidized bed boilers is the relatively isothermal combustion chamber due to the heat capacity of the bed material. It is possible to extract heat directly out of the fluidized bed material. This means that the oxygen content in the combustion gas may be increased without increasing the combustion temperature. Less exhaust gas needs to be recycled.

As carbon steel will corrode if aqueous phases are present, it is important to control the CO2 composition and operate the system such that formation of water containing phases is avoided. \nThere are many suggested specifications and recommendations for the type and concentration of impurities to be allowed in the CO2 stream. These impurity limits are often set from a health, safety, and environmental point of view and due to lack of knowledge are not so much based on material integrity issues. This gap of knowledge makes it difficult to make a specification that will ensure safe operation and long-term integrity. \nThe present paper summarises the results of a large research project that systematically tested CO2 with various combinations and concentrations of potentially reactive impurities (H2O, NO2, SO2, H2S, O2). It was clearly shown that many impurity combinations were basically inert, while other resulted in chemical reactions and some combinations even resulted in formation of a separate aqueous phase that contained high concentrations of sulfuric and nitric acid as well as elemental sulphur. This aqueous phase was corrosive to carbon steel. Corrosion was also observed in certain situations even if a separate aqueous phase was not observed visually. \nIt is important to avoid precipitation of solid products since it may cause problems at the injection point and in the reservoir. The present work demonstrated that the types and combination of impurities that are present is important for the maximum impurity concentration that can be allowed to prevent chemical reactions and corrosion from occurring.

Such challenge is followed by a world demand from signatory countries of the Kyoto Agreement (ratified in 2005) to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. In spite of, the Brazil does not have any reduction goal, in the first period (2008 to 2012) the oil sector (E&P activity), by their oil operators companies that works in our country, has already established corporative goals to avoided greenhouse gas emissions in their production facilities (bigger predominance of offshore production unities). The present work approaches the economic and technical evaluation of a carbon dioxide (CO2) separation and capture proposal process (First and Second Proposal Case) comparatively your absence (Base Case). The First Case consider the CO2 separation and capture both the produced gas and exhausted gases of one turbine driven by gas. The Second Case consider only the CO2 separation and capture from the produced gas. At the present, in Brazil, it has not been developed yet suitable technologies, for such use, and the CO2 is normally disposal to the atmosphere. Moreover, the present Regulation (104/2002 ANP Decree) limit the potential of CO2 use existing in the gas composition that is marketed in the country, due to not differentiate the uses of this important fuel. The results obtained of this thesis, by using a process simulator of commercially use showed CO2 avoided emissions of 55 % to the atmosphere (Second Proposal Case that shows the best economic evaluation) related to the result obtained from the Base Case. This relevant result is equivalent in mass flow, to the avoidance emission of roughly 241 x 10 tons per year, for a single pilot unity proposal. According the economic evaluation study, the Second Proposal Case (VPL:US$ 15,3 x 10) was better than the First Case (VPL: US$ 13,9 x 10), using the Case Base as reference. Within the benefits expected with the use of this new technology are the following: reduction both the internal gas consumption and natural gas losses (atmospheric disposal), emissions avoided of CO2 and hydrocarbons, beyond the increase of CO2 and gas storage practices in offshore depleted oil fields.

Under price-based policies, a country with lower abatement costs might engage in additional abatement effort for which it is not compensated. Under a quantity-based policy with a given allocation, a seller of permits can also be negatively affected by a lower carbon price. We also argue that abatement cost shocks to renewable energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS) are different in terms of their effects on international energy markets. A shock to renewable energy benefits energy importers because the value of fossil fuels is reduced. The opposite holds for a shock to CCS which benefits energy exporters.

Thus, when design innovation is realized in a too advanced way, such designs are expected to be rejected by perceivers at first glance due to low familiarity.

From a climate science perspective, emission budgets define the amount of emissions that are still available to meet a given temperature goal. In case of a 2\u00b0C target, the estimated global carbon budget is between 940 Gt and 390Gt (medium estimate 760 Gt), in case of a 1.5\u00b0C target, it is between 167 Gt and -48Gt (medium estimate 59 Gt) starting in 2017 (see MCC, 2017). In contrast, debates in the policy arena often focus on reduction targets for specific years, with a prominent example given by the target range expressed by the European Union of reducing emissions by 80 to 95% by 2050 (as discussed in EU COM 2011a) or the 2020 and 2030 targets of 20% and 30% GHG emission reductions below 1990 levels in the EU. Due to the complexity of the models and topics, climate models lack a sufficient level of detail to answer the question what kind of transformation is necessary for the energy system as well as the non-energy sectors to stay within those budgets. Integrated assessment models are designed to include a certain level of detail of the energy and non-energy system while still being able to model the impacts although in a much less complex way of emissions on the climate. In contrast, techno-economic bottom-up models or macroeconomic models which are usually applied to analyse transformation pathways lack the information content to make predictions about the transformations\u2019 impacts on the extent of climate change. In this paper, we combine analyses from techno-economic bottom-up models with emission budgets provided by climate and integrated assessment models and compare them with a focus on Europe. Our first aim is to identify consistencies and inconsistencies between the bottom-up analysis and the integrated assessment models. In a second step, based on this analysis and a more in-depth analysis of the sector abatement pathways, we identify sectors which could contribute to increasing the consistency between the bottom-up pathways and the budget approach, e.g. by providing for steeper mitigation pathways. In a final step, we discuss the role of negative emissions as can be provided by technologies such as bioenergy-based carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and which play a major role in integrated assessment models, but not \u2013 yet \u2013 in most of the bottom-up scenarios.

In the mid-term, the electrolysis of water using off-peak grid electricity offers a pathway to generate hydrogen with negligible greenhouse emission. In the long term, the biogeneration of hydrogen and splitting of water using photo electrolysis or thermochemical pyrolysis are feasible avenues.

Motivated by this growth, a comprehensive analysis of both the economic and engineering implications of a large wind penetration in power systems was conducted. In order to understand and capture the unique characteristics of wind generation different tools and methods were combined. First, an analysis of hourly wind and load profiles was completed for individual European countries and for the whole European region. Then, a detailed electricity model was used in order to capture the effects of a large wind penetration (up to 60% of total demand) on the power system. Finally, this information was integrated in a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, the MIT EPPA model a tool for analyzing the economy-wide implications of energy and climate policies. Based on the bottom-up modeling results, a new methodology for capturing wind intermittency in EPPA, through modeling system flexibility requirements at large wind penetration levels, was proposed. As a case study, a 40% and an 80% GHG emissions reduction scenarios by 2050 (relative to 1990 levels) were modeled for Europe. The analysis illustrates that, in order to mitigate wind intermittency, particularly for large wind penetration levels, a system needs to have enough flexible capacity installed traditionally provided by gas or hydro technologies. However, it is shown that for a significant emissions reduction scenario (80% GHG reduction in Europe by 2050), providing this flexibility from the generation side might be challenging as low-cost, low-carbon, flexible, dispatchable technological options might be limited. This might impose a constraint on the total electricity use and on the growth of wind penetration. Thus, the importance of considering other options for providing flexibility in the system, such as storage, demand response or interconnections is displayed. In particular, the wind and load profile analysis indicates a high value of interconnecting wind farms in the European region.

This study mainly focuses on the atmospheric mineral carbonation of mineral admixtures like fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), and silica fume (SF), which are the industrial by-products and are being treated as waste. This study also focuses on the effect of fineness of different mineral admixtures on the degree of atmospheric mineral carbonation. Fly ash with three different levels of fineness (FA, FA I, and FA II), GGBS with three different levels of fineness (GGBS, GGBS I, and GGBS II), and silica fume were mixed with activators like lime and gypsum and were left for atmospheric mineral carbonation. Mineralogical characterisations were done using X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermo gravimetric analysis (TGA), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Degree of carbonation of the samples was analyzed and calculated using the TGA results. From the comparative analysis of all the samples, it was found that GGBS II had highest degree of carbonation.
