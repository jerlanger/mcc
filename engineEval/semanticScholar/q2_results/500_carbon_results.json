Currently, the major CCS efforts focus on the removal of carbon dioxide directly from industrial or utility plants and subsequently storing it in secure geologic reservoirs. The rationale for CCS is to enable the use of fossil fuels while reducing the emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere, and thereby mitigating global climate change. At present, fossil fuels are the dominant source of the global primary energy supply, and will likely remain so for the rest of the century. Fossil fuels supply over 85 per cent of all primary energy; the rest is made up of nuclear, hydro-electricity, and renewable energy (commercial biomass, geothermal, wind, and solar energy). While great efforts and investments are made by many nations to increase the share of renewable energy in the primary energy supply and to foster conservation and efficiency improvements of fossil-fuel usage, addressing climate-change concerns during the coming decades will likely require significant contributions from CCS. In his keynote address at the 9th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies (GHGT-9, November 2008), Jae Edmonds1 reported that \u2018preparations for the IPCC 5th Assessment Report have indicated that meeting low carbon stabilization limits is only possible with CCS\u2019. The goals of this paper are to describe the fundamentals of CCS technology, to discuss the current status and costs of the technology, and to explore the policy context required for CCS to become a significant climate-change mitigation option. The paper is divided into sections as follows. Section II describes the major components of a CCS system and their commercial use today, while section III describes the CO2 sources that are compatible with CCS.

The results indicate that CCTS can theoretically contribute to the decarbonisation of Europe\u2019s energy and industrial sectors. This requires a CO2 certificate price rising to \u20ac55 per tCO2 in 2050, and sufficient CO2 storage capacity available for both on- and offshore sites. Yet CCTS deployment is highest in CO2-intensive industries where emissions cannot be avoided by fuel switching or alternative production processes. In all scenarios, the importance of the industrial sector as a first-mover to induce the deployment of CCTS is highlighted. By contrast, a decrease in available storage capacity or a more moderate increase in CO2 prices will significantly reduce the role of CCTS as a CO2 mitigation technology, especially in the energy sector.

Global warming as a consequence of high CO 2 level in the atmosphere is considered as one of the major long lasting problems in the twenty-first century. Concern over these major issues with regard to severe climate change and ocean acidification motivated us to develop the technologies that capture the evolved CO 2 from entering into the carbon cycle. Therefore, CO 2 capture and storage technology is attracting increasing interest in order to reduce carbon level in the atmosphere which in turn mitigates global climate issues. In this regard, highly efficient adsorbents e.g.; zeolites, alkali metal oxides, activated carbon, porous silica show considerable progress in post combustion CO 2 capture. Recently, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), porous organic polymers (POPs), porous clays, N-doped carbon etc. are explored as versatile and quite elegant way for next-generation CO 2 capture.

The purpose of this technical report is to address this confusion by discussing the state of CCS technological readiness in terms of existing commercial deployments of CO2 capture systems, CO2 transportation pipelines, CO2 injection systems and measurement, monitoring and verification (MMV) systems for CO2 injected into deep geologic structures. To date, CO2 has been captured from both natural gas and coal fired commercial power generating facilities, gasification facilities and other industrial processes. Transportation via pipelines and injection of CO2 into the deep subsurface are well established commercial practices with more than 35 years of industrial experience. There are also a wide variety of MMV technologies that have been employed to understand the fate of CO2 injected into the deep subsurface. The four existing end-to-end commercial CCS projects \u2013 Sleipner, Snohvit, In Salah and Weyburn \u2013 are using a broad range of these technologies, and prove that, at a high level, geologic CO2 storage technologies are mature and capable of deploying at commercial scales. Whether wide scale deployment of CCS is currently or will soon be a cost-effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions is largely a function of climate policies which have yet to be enacted and the public\u2019s willingness to incur costs to avoid dangerous anthropogenic interference with the Earth\u2019s climate. There are significant benefits to be had by continuing to improve through research, development, and demonstration suite of existing CCS technologies.

The optimal pressure ratio of the oxy-combustion technology system was obtained. The variations in the net cycle performance of the three systems were compared using the specific CO2 capture. The net power of the post-combustion capture scheme is lower than that of all other systems, but it has the highest efficiency. However, its biggest disadvantage is a much lower CO2 capture rate than the oxy-combustion capture which exhibits nearly 100 % capture rate.

Most ongoing CCS projects inject CO2 into sedimentary basins and require an impermeable cap rock to prevent the CO2 from migrating to the surface. Alternatively, captured carbon can be stored through injection into reactive rocks (such as mafic or ultramafic lithologies), provoking CO2 mineralization and, thereby, permanently fixing carbon with negligible risk of return to the atmosphere. Although in situ mineralization offers a large potential volume for carbon storage in formations such as basalts and peridotites (both onshore and offshore), its large-scale implementation remains little explored beyond laboratory-based and field-based experiments. In this Review, we discuss the potential of mineral carbonation to address the global CCS challenge and contribute to long-term reductions in atmospheric CO2. Emphasis is placed on the advances in making this technology more cost-effective and in exploring the limits and global applicability of CO2 mineralization.

This article surveys and evaluates the technology of processing carbon dioxide and hydrogen into sustainable synthetic carbohydrate fuels and the related economics in relation to a particular route, the capture of carbon dioxide from the flue gas stream of gas burning power stations, provided the gaseous fuel is of biogenic origin. Biogenic methane is renewable and can, after combustion into carbon dioxide, via carbon capture be further processed into a range of carbohydrate fuels, or alternatively captured for final storage under carbon capture and store (CCS). It is proposed that the air intake of a power station be replaced by cooled flue gases consisting mainly of carbon dioxide, enriched with oxygen obtained by electrolysis of water. The co-produced hydrogen can then be processed further into more easily transportable and storable forms of fuel. This implies that a gas-fired power station is not so much a means of producing energy, but rather of producing pure carbon dioxide. The capture process as such is the same as the one which arises if the purpose is carbon capture and use or CCS in which case capture of CO2 from the combustion of methane from biogenic origin amounts to negative emissions. The indirect route of supplying and using energy via the production of carbohydrate fuels requires much more primary energy than the direct use of electricity does. For this reason, use of that indirect route is efficient for aviation, where the direct route of electric power is impractical. For shipping, there also is the alternative of the implicit transport of hydrogen as part of ammonia. It is assumed that the use of biogenic methane followed by processing of the captured carbon dioxide into synthetic hydrocarbon fuels is in combination with volcanic carbon hydroxide, sufficient to meet the demand for hydrocarbon fuels.

A series of porous organic polymers with aromatic building units have been synthesized and compared to explore their high-pressure performance as adsorbents of gases of relevant importance for energy and the environment. Particular attention was paid to methane storage up to pressures as high as 180 bar at ambient temperature. Porous polymers were prepared starting from a wide choice of spatially expanded aromatic monomers: a systematic change in the number of rings, variable size and shape was taken under consideration. The high number of rings (up to 6), which act as multiple reactive sites and form a number of connections between the multi-dentate nodes, result in an extensive cross-linked framework. Condensation was obtained by two alternative synthetic routes, viz., Yamamoto cross-coupling and Friedel\u2013Crafts alkylation reactions. The structural characteristics and high stability of the porous polymers, even to mechanical compression, were carefully determined by several methods, including 1D and 2D solid state NMR, FT IR and thermal analyses. The CH4 uptake in the porous polymers allowed an understanding of the incremental response to pressure, up to extremely high values, and the exploitation of the extensive pressure range to customize the gas adsorption/desorption cycles for storage and transportation. Owing to the notable presence of large mesopores and network flexibility, combined with high surface area, a remarkable gain at high pressure was achieved, ensuring a highly competitive uptake/delivery efficiency.

While single CO2-based innovations are entering the markets, the possible economic effects of a large-scale CO2 utilization still remain unclear to policy makers and the public. Hence, this paper reviews the literature on CCU and provides insights on the motivations and potential of making use of recovered CO2 emissions as a commodity in the industrial production of materials and fuels. By analyzing data on current global CO2 supply from industrial sources, best practice benchmark capture costs and the demand potential of CO2 utilization and storage scenarios with comparative statics, conclusions can be drawn on the role of different CO2 sources. For near-term scenarios the demand for the commodity CO2 can be covered from industrial processes, that emit CO2 at a high purity and low benchmark capture cost of approximately 33 \u20ac/t. In the long-term, with synthetic fuel production and large-scale CO2 utilization, CO2 is likely to be available from a variety of processes at benchmark costs of approx. 65 \u20ac/t. Even if fossil-fired power generation is phased out, the CO2 emissions of current industrial processes would suffice for ambitious CCU demand scenarios. At current economic conditions, the business case for CO2 utilization is technology specific and depends on whether efficiency gains or substitution of volatile priced raw materials can be achieved. Overall, it is argued that CCU should be advanced complementary to mitigation technologies and can unfold its potential in creating local circular economy solutions.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "010fe69c5cbaf91455d290e0bff1c480c62b772e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2064087113", "DOI": "10.1557/MRS2008.63", "CorpusId": 135489174}, "title": "Carbon dioxide capture and storage", "abstract": "Reducing CO 2 emissions from the use of fossil fuel is the primary purpose of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS).

Assessment of these aims requires quantitative environmental evaluation. So far, evaluation of CCU is based on ad hoc criteria such as the amount of CO2 utilized, simplified CO2 balances or CO2 storage duration. Albeit these criteria may be useful for very early stages of potential research pathways, we show that they are insufficient as basis for decisions on implementations and that they may lead to even qualitatively wrong environmental evaluation of CCU. Therefore, a holistic evaluation using life-cycle assessment (LCA) is mandatory. However, the application of LCA to CCU is subject to methodological pitfalls: (i) utilized CO2 might intuitively be considered as negative GHG emissions; (ii) since CCU usually generates products both in the capture and in the utilization process, choices exist how to allocate emissions to the individual products and (iii) CO2 storage duration is not reflected in traditional LCA. To avoid the existing pitfalls, we provide a systematic framework for LCA of CCU in which (i) the utilized CO2 is correctly considered as regular feedstock with its own production emissions; (ii) recommendations for obtaining product-specific LCA results for CCU processes are given and (iii) the CO2 storage duration is incorporated into a time-resolved global warming metric. The developed framework is illustrated by simplified LCA of CO2 capture from the atmosphere and from coal power plants, and of CO2 utilization for methanol and polymer production.

CCS can be part of such a portfolio, but wind, wave, tidal, solar and energy efficiency were preferred.

The most widely used chemical absorption technique for carbon capture and storage/sequestration (CCS) would be essentially adopting amino-containing absorbents through formation of C\u2013N bond in terms of mechanistic consideration. However, extensive energy input in desorption and compression process would be a crucial barrier to realize practical CCS. On the other hand, CO2 is very attractive as an environmentally friendly feedstock to replace the hazardous phosgene route for making commodity chemicals, fuels, and materials from a standpoint of green chemistry, whereas the reactions involving CO2 are commonly carried out at high pressure, which may not be economically suitable and also pose safety concerns. The challenge is to develop catalysts that are capable of activating CO2 under low pressure (preferably at 1 atm), and thus incorporating CO2 into organic molecules catalytically. We have proposed a carbon capture and utilization (CCU) strategy as an alternative approach to addressing the energy penalty problem in CCS. The essence of our strategy is to use captured CO2, also considered as the activated form of CO2, which could render this system suitable for accomplishing chemical transformation of CO2 under low pressure to avoid an additional desorption step. Indeed, CO2 could be activated through the formation of carbamate/alkyl carbonate with Lewis basic nitrogen species.

Once captured using various technologies, CO2 is desorbed and compressed for either storage (carbon capture and storage (CCS)) or production of value-added products (carbon capture and utilization (CCU)). Among various products that can be synthesized from CO2, methanol and formic acid are of high interest because they can be used directly as fuels or to generate H2 on demand at low temperatures (<100 \u00b0C), making them attractive hydrogen carriers (12.6 and 4.4 wt % H2 in methanol and formic acid, respectively). Methanol is already produced in huge quantities worldwide (100 billion liters annually) and is also a raw material for many chemicals and products, including formaldehyde, dimethyl ether, light olefins, and gasoline. The production of methanol through chemical recycling of captured CO2 is at the heart of the so-called \"methanol economy\" that we have proposed with the late Prof. George Olah at our Institute. Recently, there has been significant progress in the low-temperature synthesis of formic acid (or formate salts) and methanol from CO2 and H2 using homogeneous catalysts. Importantly, several studies have combined CO2 capture and hydrogenation, where captured CO2 (including from air) was directly utilized to produce formate and CH3OH without requiring energy intensive desorption and compression steps. This Account centers on that topic. A key feature in the combined CO2 capture and conversion studies reported to date for the synthesis of formic acid and methanol is the use of an amine or alkali-metal hydroxide base for capturing CO2, which can assist the homogeneous catalysts in the hydrogenation step. We start this Account by examining the combined processes where CO2 is captured in amine solutions and converted to alkylammonium formate salts. The effect of amine basicity on the reaction rate is discussed along with catalyst recycling schemes. Next, methanol synthesis by this combined process, with amines as capturing agents, is explored. We also examine the system developments for effective catalyst and amine recycling in this process. We next go through the effect of catalyst molecular structure on methanol production while elucidating the main deactivating pathway involving carbonylation of the metal center. The recent advances in first-row transition metal catalysts for this process are also mentioned. Subsequently, we discuss the capture of CO2 using hydroxide bases and conversion to formate salts.

If feasible, CCS policies can carry lower social costs compared to renewable energy policies, in particular when second-best policies are only employed temporally. In case fossil resources are abundant and renewable energy costs low, renewable energy policies perform better.

Amid concerns over maintaining security, and hence diversity, of supply, CCS could allow the continued use of coal, oil and gas whilst avoiding the CO2 emissions currently associated with fossil fuel use. This project has explored some of the geological, environmental, technical, economic and social implications of this technology. The UK is well placed to exploit CCS with a large offshore storage capacity, both in disused oil and gas fields and saline aquifers. This capacity should be sufficient to store CO2 from the power sector (at current levels) for a least one century, using well understood and therefore likely to be lower-risk, depleted hydrocarbon fields and contained parts of aquifers. It is very difficult to produce reliable estimates of the (potentially much larger) storage capacity of the less well understood geological reservoirs such as non-confined parts of aquifers. With the majority of its large coal fired power stations due to be retired during the next 15 to 20 years, the UK is at a natural decision point with respect to the future of power generation from coal; the existence of both national reserves and the infrastructure for receiving imported coal makes clean coal technology a realistic option. The notion of CCS as a \u2018bridging\u2019 or \u2018stop-gap\u2019 technology (i.e. whilst we develop \u2018genuinely\u2019 sustainable renewable energy technologies) needs to be examined somewhat critically, especially given the scale of global coal reserves. If CCS plant is built, then it is likely that technological innovation will bring down the costs of CO2 capture, such that it could become increasingly attractive. As with any capitalintensive option, there is a danger of becoming \u2018locked-in\u2019 to a CCS system. The costs of CCS in\nour model for UK power stations in the East Midlands and Yorkshire to reservoirs in the North Sea are between \u00a325 and \u00a360 per tonne of CO2 captured, transported and stored. This is between about 2 and 4 times the current traded price of a tonne of CO2 in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. In addition to the technical and economic requirements of the CCS technology, it should also be socially and environmentally acceptable. Our research has shown that, given an acceptance of the severity and urgency of addressing climate change, CCS is viewed favourably by members of the public, provided it is adopted within a portfolio of other measures. The most commonly voiced concern from the public is that of leakage and this remains perhaps the greatest uncertainty with CCS. It is not possible to make general statements concerning storage security; assessments must be site specific. The impacts of any potential leakage are also somewhat uncertain but should be balanced against the deleterious effects of increased acidification in the oceans due to uptake of elevated atmospheric CO2 that have already been observed. Provided adequate long term monitoring can be ensured, any leakage of CO2 from a storage site is likely to have minimal localised impacts as long as leaks are rapidly repaired. A regulatory framework for CCS will need to include risk assessment of potential environmental and health and safety impacts, accounting and monitoring and liability for the long term. In summary, although there remain uncertainties to be resolved through research and demonstration projects, our assessment demonstrates that CCS holds great potential for significant cuts in CO2 emissions as we develop long term alternatives to fossil fuel use.

It can be trapped in subsurface reservoirs in structural or stratigraphic traps beneath cap rocks, as a residual CO2 saturation in pore spaces along the CO2 migration path within the reservoir rock, by dissolution into the native pore fluid (most commonly brine), by reaction of acidified groundwater with mineral components of the reservoir rock, or by adsorption onto surfaces within the reservoir rock, e.g. onto the carbonaceous macerals that are the principal components of coal. Estimates of the CO2 storage capacity of oil and gas fields on the UKCS suggest that they could store between 1200 and 3500\u00d7106 t of CO2 and up to 6100\u00d7106 t CO2, respectively. Estimating the regional CO2 storage potential of saline water-bearing sedimentary rocks is resource-intensive and no UK estimates have yet taken into account all the factors that should be considered. Existing studies estimate the pore volume and the likely CO2 saturation in the closed structures in a potential reservoir formation but do not take account of the potentially limiting regional pressure rise likely to occur as a result of the very large-scale CO2 injection that would be necessary to make an impact on national emissions. There is undoubtedly great storage potential in the saline water-bearing reservoir rocks of the basins around the UK, but the real challenge for studies of aquifer CO2 storage capacity in the UK is perhaps not to estimate the total theoretical CO2 storage capacity, as this is not a particularly meaningful number. Rather it is to thoroughly investigate selected reservoirs perceived to have good storage potential to a standard where there is scientific consensus that the resulting storage capacity estimates are realistic.

Such processes form abundant veins and travertine deposits, particularly in association with tectonically exposed mantle peridotite. This is important in the global carbon cycle, in weathering, and in understanding physical-chemical interaction during retrograde metamorphism. Enhancing the rate of such reactions is a proposed method for geologic CO2 storage, and perhaps for direct capture of CO2 from near-surface fluids. We review, synthesize, and extend inferences from a variety of sources. We include data from studies on natural peridotite carbonation processes, carbonation kinetics, feedback between permeability and volume change via reaction-driven cracking, and proposed methods for enhancing the rate of natural mineral carbonation via in situ processes (\u201cat the outcrop\u201d) rather than ex situ processes (\u201cat the smokestack\u201d).", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "9424096c13c453c9895aeee06cacdead3954dd56", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2165339708", "DOI": "10.1098/rsta.2006.1953", "CorpusId": 2769660, "PubMed": "17272239"}, "title": "Carbon dioxide capture and geological storage", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide capture and geological storage is a technology that could be used to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere from large industrial installations such as fossil fuel-fired power stations by 80\u201390%.

The technology has aroused considerable interest because it can help reduce emissions from fossil fuels which are likely to remain the dominant source of primary energy for decades to come.

The dense layer structure enables the dense integration of functional groups on the channel walls, creating a new version of COFs with high capacity, reusability, selectivity, and separation productivity for flue gas. These results suggest that channel-wall functional engineering could be a facile and powerful strategy to develop 2D COFs for high-performance gas storage and separation.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "57d6641595423dc10ca4b33be7cb54396dffcbab", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1981379581", "DOI": "10.1126/SCIENCE.326.5959.1461-B", "CorpusId": 84034750}, "title": "Carbon Capture, No Storage", "abstract": "Marine Biology\nSponges that inhabit coral reefs act as high-volume water filters, acquiring up to 90% of their daily carbon intake from dissolved organic matter, yet the biomass of these sponges remains constant.
