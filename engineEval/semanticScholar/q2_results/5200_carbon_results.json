This results in the increasing use of energetic resources, especially primary energy carriers: hard coal and lignite, oil and natural gas. Global resources of primary energetic resources (in 2005) were estimated at 900 mld ton (1 ton = 42 GJ). Within the structure of reserves of fossil energetic resources, solid resources (hard coal and lignite) amount to about 540 mld ton, which constitutes about 60% of the global resources. Global hard coal resources are estimated at about 431 mld ton. The USA has the greatest resources of hard coal \uf02d about 112.3 mld ton (about 26%), just before China \u2013 over 62 mld ton (over 14%). Hard coal in Poland can be found in 136 deposits, however, only 47 of them are managed. Poland has about 43 mld ton of balanced stocks of hard coal, with 16 mld ton of managed deposits, while industrial reserves (extraction resources) constitute only 4.2 mld ton. The extraction of hard coal in Poland in 2007 amounted to about 82.8 mln ton. Global lignite resources amount to about 417 mld ton.

More than 60% of oil reserves is located in the Middle East, with the three countries \uf02d Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq owning about 42% of the global reserves.

Global natural gas reserves are estimated at about 161 mld toe (about 19% of primary global resources). The unconventional reserves of natural gas (among others \u2013 hydrates) are also estimated at about 280 mld toe. The greatest evidenced resources of natural gas occur in the Middle East (more than 40%) as well as in Russia (about 32% of global reserves).

There are numerous forecasts for national electric energy demand made by various institutions and authors. All of them (until 2030) assume electric energy production on the basis of primary stable energy carriers, thus, hard coal and lignite. These carriers are burdensome for the environment, since they are characterized by excessive greenhouse gases emission. The growing demand for direct energy, in accordance with ecological conditions, will require the use of clean technologies as well as disposal and deposition of CO2 \u2013 that is, CCS technologies (Carbon Capture and Storage). Since Poland joined the European Union in 2004, we have to face and prepare for all the changes which the European Commission has planned for the EU countries. The essential issue is the reduction of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. There are many technologies allowing to capture CO2 from the stream of gases, and consequently, its sequestration by means of storage in the oceans, deep geological layers or mineral carbonation. In 2006 the EU\uf02d27 emitted greenhouse gases in the total amount of more than 5.14 mld ton of CO2 equivalent. The greatest emittant of greenhouse gases in the power economy is the power industry, which emitted 1.59 mld ton of CO2 equivalent. The emission of greenhouse gases in Poland amounted to 400.5 mln ton of CO2 equivalent, out of which 330 mln ton is CO2 emission. The international community \u2013 the UN, the EU and many developed countries \u2013 already in 1990s (and earlier), intended to counteract the negative impact of greenhouse gases and dust emission. The problem of the environment protection is presently a matter of great importance, as far as the strategy of global economy development. It has been the subject-matter of numerous conventions, protocols, conferences, directives, regulations and etc. Polish power industry and energo-chemical industry in 2008 were entitled to emit about 201 mln ton of CO2 (additional in the reserves for the new investments). In the next years coming Poland will not be able to meet the granted emission limits.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "5e765ad42f552914e20840800a8f154c31c3f198", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1981029937", "DOI": "10.1364/ACPC.2012.AF3D.3", "CorpusId": 24028128}, "title": "Environmental monitoring with portable, tunable diode laser based gas analyzers", "abstract": "Summary form only given.

Since the industrial revolution, one consequence are rising global mean temperatures which could change by 2\u25e6C to 4.5\u25e6C until 2100 if mitigation enforcement of CO2 emissions fails.To counteract this projected global warming, climate engineering techniques aim at intendedly cooling Earth\u2019s climate for example through terrestrial carbon dioxide removal (tCDR) which is commonly perceived as environmentally friendly. Here, tCDR refers to the establishment of large-scale biomass plantations (BPs) in combination with the production of long-lasting carbon products such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage or biochar. This thesis examines the potentials and possible consequences of tCDR by analysing land-use scenarios with different spatial and temporal scales of BPs using an advanced biosphere model forced by varying climate projections. These scenario simulations were evaluated with focus on their carbon sequestration potentials, trade-offs with food production and impacts on natural ecosystems and climate itself. Synthesised, the potential of tCDR to permanently extract CO2 out of the atmosphere is found to be small, regardless of the emission scenario, the point of onset or the spatial extent. On the contrary, the aforementioned trade-offs and impacts are shown to be unfavourable in most cases. In a high emission scenario with a late onset of BPs (i.e. around 2050), even unlimited area availability for tCDR could not reverse past emissions sufficiently, e.g. BPs covering 25% of all agricultural or natural land could delay 2100\u2019s carbon budget by no more than two or three decades (equivalent to \u2248550 or 800 GtC tCDR), respectively. However, simultaneous emission reductions and an earlier establishment of BPs (i.e. around 2035) could result in strong carbon extractions reversing past emissions (e.g. six or eight decades or \u2248500 or 800 GtC, respectively). In both cases, land transformation for tCDR leads to high \u201ccosts\u201d for ecosystems (e.g. biodiversity loss) and food production (e.g. reduction of almost 75%). Restricting the available land for BPs by these trade-off constraints leaves very small tCDR potentials (well below 100 GtC) despite a near-future onset (in 2020). Similarly, simulated tCDR potentials on dedicated BP areas defined in a commonly used and published low emissions scenario stay below the aimed values using current management practices. Some potential may lie the reduction of carbon losses from field to end-products, new management options and the restoration of degraded soils with BPs. This thesis contradicts the assumption that tCDR could be an effective and environmentally friendly way of complementing or substituting strong and rapid mitigation efforts.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "636da17d165d9f878c78d94ef6d52e63d89425a3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3005212939", "DOI": "10.1002/er.5035", "CorpusId": 213903326}, "title": "Combination of double and single cyclic pressure alternation technique to increase CO2 sequestration with heat mining in enhanced geothermal reservoirs by thermo\u2010hydro\u2010mechanical coupling method", "abstract": "The rise in global temperature due to an unceasingly increase in non\u2010condensable gases (NCG) prompts more development of safe and economical CCUS (Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage) technologies. Carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration with heat mining in deep enhanced geothermal systems (EGSs) is one of the promising methods to reduce CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. In this study, a cyclic alternation of pressures at the injection and production wells is applied in an EGS for heat mining together with CO2 deposit. Simultaneous alternation of the injection and production pressures can significantly increase the amount of CO2 sequestrated compared to applying a fixed pumping or withdrawing pressures at the injector and producer respectively. At the injection well, alternation in pumping pressures at high frequency (small interval of days) increased CO2 sequestration rate. Reducing the pumping frequency resulted in the lowering of the total amount of CO2 sequestrated, lesser than using a fixed pumping pressure. The alternation in pumping frequency has a direct relationship to the CO2 sequestration rate. The frequency of the injection and production pressures refers to the interval in days of the interchange in pressure between high to a low value and vice\u2010versa.

Moreover, as part of mitigating the greenhouse gas effects due to the emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas, organic-rich shales are considered a possible alternate geologic storage. This is due to the adsorptive properties of organic kerogen and clay minerals within the shale matrix. Therefore, this research looks at evaluating the sequestration potential of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas in kerogen nanopores with the use of the lattice Boltzmann method under varying experimental pressures and different pore sizes. Gas flow in micro/nano pores differ in hydrodynamics due to the dominant pore wall effects, as the mean free path (\u03bb) of the gas molecules become comparable to the characteristic length (H) of the pores. In so doing, the traditional computational methods break down beyond the continuum region, and the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is employed. The lattice Boltzmann method is a mesoscopic numerical method for fluid system, where a unit of gas particles is assigned a discrete distribution function (f). The particles stream along defined lattice links and collide locally at the lattice sites to conserve mass and momentum. The effects of gas-wall collisions (Knudsen layer effects) is incorporated into the LBM through an effective-relaxation-time model, and the discontinuous velocity at the pore walls is resolved with a slip boundary condition. Above all, the time lag (slip effect) created by CO2 gas molecules due to adsorption and desorption over a time period, and the surface diffusion as a result of the adsorption-gradient are captured by an adsorption isotherm and included in our LBM. Implementing the Langmuir adsorption isotherm at the pore walls for both CO2 gas revealed the underlying flow mechanism for CO2 gas in a typical kerogen nano-pore is dominated by the slip flow regime. Increasing the equilibrium pressure, increases the mass flux due to adsorption. On the other hand, an increase in the nano-pore size caused further increase in the mass flux due to free gas and that due to adsorbed gas. Thus, in the kerogen nano-pores, CO2 gas molecules are more adsorptive indicating a possible multi-layer adsorption. Therefore, this study not only provides a clear understanding of the underlying flow mechanism of CO2 in kerogen nano-pores, but also provides a potential alternative means to mitigate the greenhouse gas effect (GHG) by sequestering CO2 in organic-rich shales.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "bfa9de0afb910346f3d5a9be0ec5c81d9e29bfd2", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.31471/1993-9868-2021-2(36)-31-41", "CorpusId": 246883716}, "title": "Technologies for capturing carbon dioxide and prospects of its utilization in depleted oil and gas fields", "abstract": "The problem of global warming and climate change requires global efforts to reduce the negative impact on the atmosphere. Capturing carbon dioxide is a key strategy in achieving pollution reduction targets. Reducing air pollution can be achieved by reducing the share of fossil fuels in the energy balance, introducing technologies for generating electricity from renewable sources and increasing the energy efficiency of production. An important step towards decarbonization is the introduction of carbon dioxide capture technologies in large industrial plants. These technologies involve capturing carbon dioxide during the combustion of coal or gas and transporting it to a disposal site with its subsequent storage without contact with the atmosphere. The most common technologies are post-combustion, pre-combustion, and combustion of oxygen-enriched fuels for carbon dioxide capture. Carbon dioxide emitted from flue gases can be used commercially, as a raw material for the food and chemical industries. A promi-sing direction for the utilization of large volumes of carbon dioxide is its injection into depleted oil and gas fields in order to increase the recovery factors of hydrocarbons.

The proposed project is known as the \u201cGreen Town\u201d where it comprises of an air scrubbing towers that has the ability to capture CO2 from the air. The selected site for the case study would then be free of anthropogenic CO2. The captured CO2 will then be transported by pipelines and stored in depleted oil/gas field for a geological time scale. Hamburg in Germany is selected as the case study city since it is a port city and is close to available geological formations for CO2 storage. The K12-B gas field has also been identified as the proposed sequestration site. The CO2 pipelines will tie-in to existing gas pipelines when they are no longer in use in the near future and the CO2 injection system for the CO2 will be retrofitted to gas platform when the gas field is no longer in use.

Here, we analyse the implications of crop\u2010based BECCS for global terrestrial vertebrate species richness, considering both the land\u2010use change (LUC) required for BECCS and the climate change prevented by BECCS. LUC impacts are determined using global\u2010equivalent, species\u2013area relationship\u2010based loss factors. We find that sequestering 0.5\u20135 Gtonne of CO2 per year with lignocellulosic crop\u2010based BECCS would require hundreds of Mha of land, and commit tens of terrestrial vertebrate species to extinction. Species loss per unit of negative emissions decreases with: (i) longer lifetimes of BECCS systems, (ii) less overall deployment of crop\u2010based BECCS and (iii) optimal land allocation, that is prioritizing locations with the lowest species loss per negative emission potential, rather than minimizing overall land use or prioritizing locations with the lowest biodiversity. The consequences of prevented climate change for biodiversity are based on existing climate response relationships. Our tentative comparison shows that for crop\u2010based BECCS considered over 30 years, LUC impacts on vertebrate species richness may outweigh the positive effects of prevented climate change. Conversely, for BECCS considered over 80 years, the positive effects of climate change mitigation on biodiversity may outweigh the negative effects of LUC. However, both effects and their interaction are highly uncertain and require further understanding, along with the analysis of additional species groups and biodiversity metrics. We conclude that factoring in biodiversity means lignocellulosic crop\u2010based BECCS should be used early to achieve the required mitigation over longer time periods, on optimal biomass cultivation locations, and most importantly, as little as possible where conversion of natural land is involved, looking instead to sustainably grown or residual biomass\u2010based feedstocks and alternative strategies for carbon dioxide removal.", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "be19869fa262497fe1d9382bd5b19121b3b0301b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3084075904", "DOI": "10.11159/icffts20.126", "CorpusId": 225265477}, "title": "Carbon Dioxide \u2013 Based Energy Storage System: a Thermodynamic\nApproach", "abstract": "Extended Abstract Compressed gas energy storage systems attract progressively the attention of researchers.

The performances of systems working with air have been extensively evaluated thermodynamically and experimentally for decades and these technologies have already been implemented at a large scale (see the sites of Huntorf and MacIntosh).

With the development of carbon dioxide capture and transport technologies, it appears as a nice way to massively revaluate CO2 and by the way to limit its emissions and climate change. After an exhaustive literature review on the capture, transport and utilization of carbon dioxide in energy storage systems, a thermodynamic model based on real fluid properties is developed. It evaluates the thermodynamic performances of an innovative cycle proposed recently by Liu et al. (2020). The influences of the turbine inlet pressure and temperature, compressor inlet and outlet pressures, charging/discharging times, the CO2 mass flowrate and isentropic efficiencies are quantified in details.

Since trees capture carbon as they grow and forests store massive quantities of it, it is easy to conclude that trees and forests should be treated as carbon sinks and left alone. But this kind of thinking reflects an incomplete understanding of the role of forests in carbon mitigation. In reality, forests have multiple roles to play in carbon mitigation, and forest management can help to optimize those roles (Bowyer et al, 2011).

In this study, carbonation efficiency for aqueous mineral carbonation (MC) was achieved through two steps, which include leaching of calcium from cement kiln dust (CKD) followed by the reaction of pure CO 2 with the calcium hydroxide precipitates formed by the hydroxylation using NaOH. Response surface methodology (RSM) with a Box-Behnken design (BBD) was applied to optimize the calcium leaching yield, while the carbonation efficiency from CKD was assessed using RSM with central composite design (CCD). Optimization of calcium leaching is highly important, as it is a rate-limiting reaction step in MC and also influences and enhances carbonation efficiency. Different parameters including acid concentration (HNO 3 ), leaching temperature, leaching time, and dose of CKD sample were considered in order to optimize the maximum yield of Ca leaching from the CKD sample. In addition, different CO 2 flow rates and temperatures were used as parameters for optimizing carbonation efficiency. Two quadratic regression models were developed for each process, i.e. calcium leaching and carbonation. For calcium leaching, a maximum of 98.55% calcium was extracted under the optimal set of acid concentration 4.13\u00a0M, 90\u00a0\u00b0C, 28\u00a0min leaching time, and 13.8\u00a0g of CKD sample.

Calcium leaching results indicate that the leaching yield was significantly affected by all the input parameters except leaching time. For carbonation, both factors affected the carbonation efficiency, with the effect temperature shown to be greater than that of the CO 2 flow rate.

In order to develop a novel absorbent, the characteristics of amino acid salts solution as a solvent for $CO_2$ capture in continuous process were investigated. The cost of $CO_2$ capture is almost 70% of total cost of CCS (carbon dioxide capture and storage). In the carbon dioxide capture process, process maintenance costs consist of the absorbent including the absorption, regeneration, degradation, and etc. It is very important to study the characteristics of absorbent in continuous process. In this study, we have investigated the properties of potassium L-lysine (PL) for getting scale-up factors in continuous process. To obtain optimum condition for removal efficiency of $CO_2$ in continuous process by varying liquid-gas (L/G) ratio, concentration of $CO_2$ and absorbent (PL) were tested. The stable condition of absorber and regenerator (L/G) ratio is 3.5. In addition, PL system reveals the highest removal efficiency of $CO_2$ with 3.5 of L/G and 10.5 vol% $CO_2$ ( $1.5Nm^3/h$ ).\u3011", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "70e7023a222c69d3b399f85e70dd6156cca80e0b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3197717939", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ERSS.2021.102236", "CorpusId": 239661599}, "title": "How do people perceive carbon capture and storage for industrial processes?

Consequently, muon detectors have been used to probe the interiors of large geological structures, by observing how the muon flux varies with direction of arrival. There is an increasing need to discriminate between materials differing only slightly in bulk density. A particularly demanding application is in monitoring underground reservoirs used for CO2 capture and storage, where bulk density changes of approximately 1 per cent are anticipated. Muon arrival is a random process, and it is the underlying expectation values, not the actual muon counts, which provide information on the physical parameters of the system. It is therefore necessary to distinguish between differences in muon counts due to real geological features, and those arising from random error. This is crucial in the low-contrast case, where the method can reach the information theoretic limit of what a data source can reveal, even in principle. To this end, methods to analyse information availability in low-contrast muon radiography have been developed, as have means to optimally interpret the available data, both for radiography and for tomography. This includes a method for calculating expectation values of muon flux for a given geological model directly, complementing existing Monte Carlo techniques.

However, simple interpretations have the potential to increase misunderstanding of new science and technology. CCS, as a technology is proposed mainly for use by the fossil fuel industry and other industrial high energy users for carbon mitigation and is relatively unknown beyond this group.

Fossil fuels and biomass are the most common feedstocks for production of hydrocarbon fuels. However, using renewable or nuclear energy, carbon dioxide and water can be recycled into sustainable hydrocarbon fuels in non-biological processes which remove oxygen from CO2 and H2O (the reverse of fuel combustion). Capture of CO2 from the atmosphere would enable a closed-loop carbon-neutral fuel cycle. The purpose of this work was to develop critical components of a system that recycles CO2 into liquid hydrocarbon fuels. The concept is examined at several scales, beginning with a broad scope analysis of large-scale sustainable energy systems and ultimately studying electrolysis of CO2 and H2O in high temperature solid oxide cells as the heart of the energy conversion, in the form of three experimental studies. The contributions of these studies include discoveries about electrochemistry and materials that could significantly improve the overall energy use and economics of the CO2-to-fuels system. The broad scale study begins by assessing the sustainability and practicality of the various energy carriers that could replace petroleum-derived hydrocarbon fuels, including other hydrocarbons, hydrogen, and storage of electricity on-board vehicles in batteries, ultracapacitors, and flywheels. Any energy carrier can store the energy of any energy source. This sets the context for CO2 recycling \u2013 sustainable energy sources like solar and wind power can be used to provide the most energy-dense, convenient fuels which can be readily used in the existing infrastructure. The many ways to recycle CO2 into hydrocarbons, based on thermolysis, thermochemical loops, electrolysis, and photoelectrolysis of CO2 and/or H2O, are critically reviewed. A process based on high temperature co-electrolysis of CO2 and H2O to produce syngas (CO/H2 mixture) is identified as a promising method. High temperature electrolysis makes very efficient use of electricity and heat (near-100% electricity-to-syngas efficiency), provides high reaction rates, and the syngas produced can be catalytically converted to hydrocarbons in well-known fuel synthesis reactors (e.g. Fischer-Tropsch). The experimental studies of high temperature electrolysis are made at different scales \u2013 at the cell level, electrode level, and in materials and microstructure development. The results include cell performance and durability, insight into electrode reaction mechanisms, and new high-performance electrode materials. The experimental studies make extensive use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and systematic variation of test conditions to examine the electrochemical phenomena. Variation of the material composition itself within families of related materials was an additional parameter used in the electrode level and materials studies that revealed more information than studying a single material would have. Using full cells, the performance and durability of a solid oxide cell applied for coelectrolysis of CO2 and H2O was investigated. High initial performance was observed but the long-term durability needs to be improved. Based on these results, an analysis of the energy balance and economics of an electrolysis-based synthetic fuel production process, including CO2 air capture and Fischer-Tropsch fuel synthesis, determined that the system can feasibly operate at 70% electricity-to-liquid fuel efficiency (higher heating value basis) and that the price of electricity needed to produce competitive synthetic gasoline (at USD$2/gal, or $0.53/L, wholesale) is 2-3 U.S. cents per kWh. For $3/gal ($0.78/L) gasoline, 4-5 cents per kWh is needed. Fuel production may already be economical in some regions that have inexpensive renewable electricity, such as Iceland. The dominant costs of the process are the electricity cost and the capital cost of the electrolyzer, and this capital cost is significantly increased when operating intermittently (on renewable power sources such as solar and wind). Low cell internal resistance, low degradation, and low manufacturing cost each contribute to a low electrolyzer capital cost, and can be traded off. One straightforward path to affordability is by improving the durability of the high current density cell operation (\u22651 A/cm) that is already possible with these cells. The negative-electrode, a composite of nickel and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), is often the major site of cell degradation, including in the co-electrolysis results presented here. To better understand the reaction mechanisms at the negative-electrode that limit performance and durability, different metal electrodes including nickel were studied using a simplified point-contact electrode geometry with a well-defined three-phase boundary (TPB; the electrode/electrolyte/gas interface where the electrochemical reactions take place). The simple geometry is useful for isolating the electrochemical properties without the effects of the complex microstructure of technological porous electrodes. Widely different impedance responses of the different metals to the same changes in test conditions (gas composition, temperature, and polarization) were observed, indicating that the same reaction mechanisms are not shared by the different metals, contrary to some recent studies. Evidence was also found that supports the explanation that impurities segregated to the TPB play a major role and are largely responsible for inconsistencies in the electrode kinetics literature. The significance of microstructure at the TPB was also revealed \u2013 the electrode polarization resistance was reduced by an order of magnitude when subjected to extreme conditions of oxidation-reduction and strong cathodic polarization, which induced the formation of a micro/nanostructured TPB. Possible reaction mechanisms for H2O/CO2 reduction and H2/CO oxidation are discussed. Novel ceramic materials based on molybdates with varying Mo valence were synthesized as possible alternative negative-electrode materials. The phase, stability, microstructure and electrical conductivity were characterized. The electrochemical activity for H2O/CO2 reduction and H2/CO oxidation was studied using simplified geometry electrodes, similar to the metals study. Unique phenomena were observed for some of the molybdate materials \u2013 they decomposed into multiple phases and formed a nanostructured surface upon exposure to operating conditions (in certain reducing atmospheres). The new phases and surface features enhanced the electronic conductivity and electrocatalytic activity. Preparing an electrode by performing controlled decomposition to form multiple desirable phases and a desirable microstructure (which can take place in situ) using these materials is a novel way to produce potentially high-performance electrodes for solid oxide cells. By modifying the composition, it was possible to prevent decomposition. Other members of the molybdate family exhibited similarly high electronic conductivity and electrocatalytic activity but did not decompose. The high activity was the result of a different mechanism, probably related to the defect chemistry of the material. The polarization resistances of the best molybdate materials were two orders of magnitude lower than that of donor-doped strontium titanates. Many of the molybdate materials were significantly activated by cathodic polarization, and they exhibited higher performance for cathodic (electrolysis) polarization than anodic (fuel cell) polarization, which makes them especially interesting for use in electrolysis electrodes. Whereas nearly all of the molybdates showed higher performance for H2O electrolysis than CO2 electrolysis, one with vanadium showed nearly equal performance, and a non-molybdate which exhibits some complementary properties to the best molybdates, Gd-doped ceria in nanoparticle form, was found to be an excellent electrocatalyst for CO2 electrolysis and CO oxidation (moreso than for H2O/H2 for which it is known to be good).", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "ab2fc09492c20e988d316cee67514fd752f467e7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2397114646", "DOI": "10.7846/JKOSMEE.2015.18.2.94", "CorpusId": 133328785}, "title": "A Numerical Study on the CO 2 Leakage Through the Fault During Offshore Carbon Sequestration", "abstract": "To mitigate the greenhouse gas emission, many carbon capture and storage projects are underway all over the world.

An electrification of the road transport sector through electric vehicles (EVs) with static charging; electric road systems (ERS); and using electricity to produce a fuel, are all suggested as possible options. An electrification of the transport sector introduces a new demand to the electricity system, and hence, will create new load profiles depending on the time of consumption and the amount of electricity used in EVs. Depending on electrification strategy, this new demand may introduce a potential for EVs to provide demand-side management to the power grid. The overall aim of this work is to investigate how an electrification of the transport sector could impact the Scandinavian electricity system with respect to energy and power. A vehicle energy consumption model was developed to estimate the variation of the energy and power demands with time and location for the transportation work on a highway under the assumption of different electrification options and drivetrains. Furthermore, demand for electric transportation have been included in electricity system models (a cost-minimizing investment model of the electricity system and one electricity system dispatch model) in order to investigate how EVs may impact the investment in new power capacity and integration of wind power in the Scandinavian and German electricity system by Year 2030. Our results, using the Norwegian road E39 as an example, indicate that an electrification of road transport implies large variations in energy and power demand both over time and location, i.e. spatial and time distributions of demands, along the road. Installation of ERS on all the European (E) and national (N) roads in Sweden and Norway would cover more than 50% of the vehicle traffic. A 25% implementation of ERS out of the total E- and N-road sufficient in order to connect the larger cities in Norway and Sweden by ERS. We have also shown that with a cap on CO2 corresponding to 93% emission reduction by Year 2050, the demand from EV in Scandinavia and Germany are mainly met by an increase in generation from wind power and to some extent coal in combination with carbon capture and storage. A smart integration of passenger EVs (vehicle-to-grid; V2G) can to some extent be used to manage variability of renewable energy sources by, for instance, substantially reduce the need for peak power capacity in the system. If using an indirect strategy for electrification of transportation, via for instance hydrogen or electrofuels, the annual electricity demand would increase more than four times compared to static or dynamic charging, albeit with increased flexibility to distribute such demand both geographically and in time.

Increasing temperatures, water scarcity and droughts, flooding and storms affect food security. Thus, mitigation actions are needed to pave the way for a sustainable future for all. Currently, agriculture directly contributes about 10-15 percent to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Adding emissions from deforestation and land use change for animal feed production, this rises to about 30 percent. Scenarios predict a significant rise in agricultural emissions without effective mitigation actions. Given all the efforts undertaken in other sectors, agriculture would then become the single largest emitter within some decades, and without mitigation in agriculture, ambitious goals, such as keeping global warming below two degrees may become impossible to reach. The main agricultural emission sources are nitrous oxide from soils and methane from enteric fermentation in ruminants. In addition, conversion of native vegetation and grasslands to arable agriculture releases large amounts of CO2 from the vegetation and from soil organic matter. The main mitigation potential lies in soil carbon sequestration and preserving the existing soil carbon in arable soils. Nitrous oxide emissions can be reduced by reduced nitrogen application, but much still remains unclear about the effect different fertilizer types and management practices have on these emissions. Methane emissions from ruminants can only be reduced significantly by a reduction in animal numbers. Sequestration, finally, can be enhanced by conservative management practices, crop rotation with legumes (grass-clover) leys and application of organic fertilizers. An additional issue of importance are storage losses of food in developing and food wastage in developed countries (each about 30-40 percent of end products). Thus, there are basically five broad categories of mitigation actions in agriculture and its broader context: zz reducing direct and indirect emissions from agriculture; zz increasing carbon sequestration in agricultural soils; zz changing human dietary patterns towards more climate friendly food consumption, in particular less animal products; zz reducing storage losses and food wastage; zz the option of bioenergy needs to be mentioned, but depending on the type of bioenergy several negative side-effects may occur, including effects on food security, biodiversity and net GHG emissions. Although there are many difficulties in the details of mitigation actions in agriculture, a paradigm of climate friendly agriculture based on five principles can be derived from the knowledge about agricultural emissions and carbon sequestration: zz Climate friendly agriculture has to account for tradeoffs and choose system boundaries adequately; zz it has to account for synergies and adopt a systemic approach; zz aspects besides mitigation such as adaptation and food security are of crucial importance; zz it has to account for uncertainties and knowledge gaps, and zz the context beyond the agricultural sector has to be taken into account, in particular food consumption and waste patterns. Regarding policies to implement such a climate friendly agriculture, not much is yet around. In climate policy, agriculture only plays a minor role and negotiations proceed only very slowly on this topic. In agricultural policy climate change mitigation currently plays an insignificant role. In both contexts, some changes towards combined approaches can be expected over the next decade. Its 13 is essential that climate policy adequately captures the special characteristics of the agricultural sector. Policies with outcomes that endanger other aspects of agriculture such as food security or ecology have to be avoided. Agriculture delivers much more than options for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and serving as a CO2 sink. We close this report with recommendations for the five most important goals to be realized in the context of mitigation and agriculture and proposals for concrete actions. First, soil organic carbon levels have to be preserved and, if possible, increased. Governments should include soil carbon sequestration in their mitigation and adaptation strategies and the climate funds should take a strong position on supporting such practices. Second, the implementation of closed nutrient cycles and optimal use of biomass has to be supported. Again, governments and funds should act on this. Policy instruments for nitrate regulation are a good starting point for this. As a third and most effective goal, we propose changes in food consumption and waste patterns. Without a switch to attitudes characterized by sufficiency, there is a danger that all attempts for mitigation remain futile. Finally, there are two goals for research, namely to develop improved knowledge on nitrous oxide dynamics, and on methods for assessment of multi-functional farming systems. Without this, adequate policy instruments for climate friendly agriculture and an optimal further development of it are not possible.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "d33863de6aaf1430755ec5b97e5490411b8948de", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3200382300", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3815206", "CorpusId": 240565430}, "title": "Full-scale FEED Study for Retrofitting the Prairie State Generating Station with an 816 MWe Capture Plant using Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Engineering Post-Combustion CO2 Capture Technology", "abstract": "This front-end engineering and design (FEED) study is for a carbon dioxide (CO2) capture system for Unit #2 (816 MW) at the Prairie State Generating Company\u2019s (PSGC) Energy Campus in Marissa, IL.

In addition to carbon capture for energy recovery, A-stages are also being utilized upstream of shortcut biological nitrogen removal (BNR) processes as these BNR processes often require a controlled influent carbon to nitrogen ratio that is lower than required for conventional BNR processes. While there is extensive knowledge on conventional activated sludge processes, including process controllers and activated sludge models, there has been little detailed research on the carbon removal mechanisms of A-stage processes operated at solids retention times (SRT) less than about one day. The overall objective of this study was to elucidate the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal mechanisms of short SRT activated sludge processes with a specific focus on the removal of the different COD fractions under varying operating conditions including dissolved oxygen, hydraulic retention time, temperature, and SRT. Once understood, automatic process control logic was developed with the purpose of producing the influent characteristics required for emerging shortcut BNR processes and capturing the remaining COD with the intent of redirecting it to an energy recovery process. To investigate the removal and assimilation of readily biodegradable substrate (SS), this study evaluated a respirometric method to estimate the SS and active heterotrophic biomass (XH) fractions of the raw wastewater influent and effluent of an A-stage pilot process. The influent SS values were comparable to the SS values determined using a physical-chemical method, but the effluent values did not correlate well. This led to the measurement of the heterotrophic aerobic yield coefficient and decay rate of the pilot process. The yield coefficient was estimated to be 0.79\u00b10.02 gCOD/gCOD, which was higher than the accepted value of 0.67 g/g. It was speculated iii that the batch respirometry tests resulted in the aerobic storage of SS and this likely contributed to the error associated with the determination of SS and XH. Therefore, physical-chemical fractionation methods were used to determine the removal of the individual COD fractions. It was concluded that the SRT was the primary control parameter and below a 0.5 day SRT the dominate COD removal mechanisms were assimilation and oxidation of readily degradable substrate and sedimentation of particulate matter. At SRTs between 0.5-1 days, COD removal became a function of hydrolysis, as adsorption of particulate and colloidal matter was maximized but not complete because of limited adsorption sites. Once adequate adsorption sites were available, effluent quality became dependent on the efficiency of bioflocculation and solids separation. While the SRT of the pilot process could not be directly controlled because of severe biofouling issues when using in situ sensors, a MLSS-based SRT controller was successfully implemented instead. The controller was able to reduce total COD removal variation in the Astage by 90%. This controller aslo provided the capability to provide a consistent carbon to nitrogen ratio to the downstream B-stage pilot process. To ascertain the settling, dewaterability, and digestibility of the sludge produced by the pilot Astage process, several standardized and recently developed methods were conducted. The results from these tests indicated that the A-stage had similar dewaterability and digestibility characteristics to primary sludge with average achievable cake solids of 34.3\u00b10.4% and average volatile solids reduction (VSR) of 82\u00b14%. The A-stage sludge also had an average specific methane yield of 0.45\u00b10.06 m 3 CH4/kgVS. These results were attributed to low extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) content. However, further research is needed to better quantify EPS and determine the effect of HRAS operating parameters on EPS production. Overall the A/B pilot study was able to capture 47% of the influent COD as waste sludge while only oxidizing 45% of the influent COD. Of the COD captured, the A-stage contributed over 70% as dry solids. Coupled with high sludge production, VSR, and methane yield the A/B process was able to generate 10-20% more biogas and 10-20% less dry solids after anaerobic digestion than a comparable single-sludge BNR process.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "d71369a0685d7923c7c789890fcff2db72febb2e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3043418009", "PubMedCentral": "7373737", "DOI": "10.3389/fmicb.2020.01645", "CorpusId": 220515809, "PubMed": "32760385"}, "title": "Sampling Device-Dependence of Prokaryotic Community Structure on Marine Particles: Higher Diversity Recovered by in situ Pumps Than by Oceanographic Bottles", "abstract": "Microbes associated with sinking marine particles play key roles in carbon sequestration in the ocean.

One of the major challenges for optimum pipeline operating conditions is to avoid phase change of the compressed CO2 and maintain temperature and pressure above the critical point throughout the pipeline route. A suitable pipe-soil heat transfer model during design can mitigate this challenge. However, variations in annual ambient temperatures, ground temperature at pipeline burial depth and soil temperature profile behaviors with seasonal climatic conditions especially during winter and summer periods also affect the heat transfer process between the soil burial medium and the CO2 pipeline. Assuming steady state, this paper investigates the nearfield temperature distribution up to 3m lateral distance away from a buried dense phase CO2 pipeline by numerical simulation with a two-dimensional pipe-soil heat transfer model at a burial depth of 2.3m to pipe center using a finite volume computational code. Results show that thermal parameters such as thermal conductivity and the soil temperature profile influence the heat exchange between pipe walls and porous soil medium.

Partial CO2 capture from carbon-intensive industrial processes is a promising starting point for initial CO2 transport and storage infrastructure projects, such as the Norwegian full-chain CCS project \u201cNorthern Lights\u201d, since specific capture cost (\u20ac/t CO2) for single-stack capture can be kept low compared to full capture from all, often less suitable stacks. This work highlights the importance of utilizing existing site energy systems to avoid significant increase in marginal abatement cost when moving from partial to full capture. A systematic and comprehensive techno-economic approach is applied that identifies a mix of heat supply sources with minimum cost based on a detailed analysis of available heat and capacity within the existing site energy system. Time-dependent variations are considered via multi-period, linear optimization. For single-stack capture from the hydrogen production unit (~0.5 Mt CO2 p.a.) of a Swedish refinery in the context of the current energy system, we find avoidance cost for the capture plant (liquefaction, ship transport, and storage excluded)of 42 \u20ac/t CO2-avoided that is predominantly driven by steam raised from available process heat in existing coolers (~6 \u20ac/t steam). For full capture from all major stacks (~1.4 Mt CO2 p.a.), the avoidance cost becomes twice as high (86 \u20ac/t CO2-avoided) due to heat supply from available heat and existing boiler capacity (combustion of natural gas) at costs of ~20\u20ac/t steam.

In this field, considering that the immersion of fish in an ice slurry is extensively used, some parameters such as ice/water, fish/ice slurry, dimension and kind of ice; etc.; have been evaluated by some Authors (Huidobro et al., 2001) in order to reduce the time of death and the ante-mortem stress. Other slaughter methods such as carbon dioxide and electrocution have been experimentally tested, not always producing satisfactory results. Indeed, although these slaughter methods resulted in a reduction of the death time, the use of the ice slurry often produces a better post-mortem flesh quality (Tejada and Huidobro, 2002; Van de Vis et al., 2003). Moreover, in Italy the use of ice slurry is not considered a slaughter method, since it is believed that the fish dies from anoxia, as in the case of fishing, while the use of other techniques would be considered as slaughter, thus implying a different kind of fish farm registration, according to the Italian law in force (Giuffrida, 2003). In a previous study (Giuffrida et al., 2006) we compared the effects of the use of ice slurry (IS) and carbon dioxide on some post-mortem quality aspects of Sparus aurata, finding a reduced ATP depletion and lipid oxidation during storage for fish slaughtered by IS.

Potential structural risks to storage integrity in the Captain Sandstone have been identified, resulting from early Cenozoic uplift, including subcrop beneath the seabed at its western extent, and faults that cut the formation and extend upwards into the Palaeogene section. Previous reservoir simulation shows that carbon dioxide injected into deeper parts of the reservoir will not migrate to shallow areas where it would be at risk of migrating towards the subcrop. Analysis of fault throw indicates that juxtaposition against potentially permeable Palaeogene strata does not occur, although juxtaposition against Chalk Group strata is common. Characterisation of the in situ stress field suggests that few of the through-going faults would be optimally-oriented for reactivation under the present-day stress regime.

The sequestration of organic and inorganic carbon in soils and its follow-up require basic information of CCS in the soils and their appropriate management techniques. The most prudent approach to estimate the role of soils as source and sink for carbon should require information on the spatial distribution of soil type, soil carbon (soil organic carbon, SOC and soil inorganic carbon, SIC) and the bulk density (BD).

Capture of CO2 from such stationary sources and storage within the pores of geologic strata (geologic carbon storage) is one approach to mitigating anthropogenic climate change. The large storage volume needed for this approach to be effective requires injection into pore space saturated with saline water in reservoir strata overlain by cap rocks. One of the main concerns regarding storage in such rocks is leakage via faults. Such leakage requires, first, that the CO2 plume encounter a fault and, second, that the properties of the fault allow CO2 to flow upward. Considering only the first step of encounter, fault population statistics suggest an approach to calculate the probability of a plume encountering a fault, particularly in the early site-selection stage when site-specific characterization data may be lacking. The resulting fault encounter probability approach is applied to a case study in the southern part of the San Joaquin Basin, California. The CO2 plume from a previously planned injection was calculated to have a 4.1% chance of encountering a fully seal offsetting fault and a 9% chance of encountering a fault with a throw half the seal thickness. Subsequently available information indicated the presence of a half-seal offsetting fault at a location 2.8 km (1.7 mi) northeast of the injection site.

One of the main concerns associated with the geological storage of CO2 is that the CO2 may leak from the intended storage formation, migrate to the near-surface environment and, eventually, escape from the ground. This is a concern because such leakage may affect aquifers overlying the storage site and containing freshwater that may be used for drinking, industry and agriculture. The IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme (IEAGHG) recently commissioned the CO2GeoNet Association to undertake a review of published and unpublished literature on this topic with the aim of summarizing 'state of the art' knowledge and identifying knowledge gaps and research priorities in this field. Work carried out by various CO2GeoNet members was also used in this study. This study identifies possible areas of conflict by combining available datasets to map the global and regional superposition of deep saline formations (DSF) suitable for CO2 storage and overlying fresh groundwater resources. A scenario classification is developed for the various geological settings where conflict could occur. The study proposes two approaches to address the potential impact mechanisms of CO2 storage projects on the hydrodynamics and chemistry of shallow groundwater. The first classifies and synthesizes changes of water quality observed in natural/industrial analogues and in laboratory experiments. The second reviews hydrodynamic and geochemical models, including coupled multiphase flow and reactive transport. Various models are discussed in terms of their advantages and limitations, with conclusions on possible impacts on groundwater resources. Possible mitigation options to stop or control CO2 leakage are assessed. The effect of CO2 pressure in the host DSF and the potential effects on shallow aquifers are also examined. The study provides a review of CO2 storage-specific regulations in the main countries undertaking CCS evaluation and research. It aims to identify the constraints imposed by existing regulations on the protection of groundwater resources and highlight the inconsistencies and gaps between CCS regulations and Water Protection regulations.

The system components are modeled and analyzed through the energy and exergy approaches. The performance parameters of the systems and the second law efficiency are calculated in different operating conditions. The results show that the maximum irreversibilities happen in the generator and the first-stage compressor, and the total destruction is higher when a micro-gas turbine is used as the prime mover.

The  process  comprises  of  the  separation  of  CO2  from  industrial  sources, transport to a storage location and then long-term isolation from the atmosphere.

Gasification is a possible option to achieve carbon capture from the fuel before combustion and to produce a hydrogen rich fuel and a CO2 stream for storage. To achieve these goals it is fundamental to use oxygen instead of air during gasification to avoid the dilution effect of nitrogen and to simplify the separation process of a CO2 stream. Oxy-gasification leads to the production of a syngas, whose main components are: CO, CO2, H2 and CH4. After syngas cleaning processes to remove particulates, tar, NH3, H2S and HCl, the water gas-shift reaction converts CO into CO2, thus the final syngas main components are only H2 and CO2, which simplifies CO2 capture. However, the production of oxygen increases the overall cost of gasification process and may be a drawback of the process. This paper compares the performance of a pilot scale gasification installation when air or oxygen is used as gasification medium. Co-gasification studies were undertaken on a pilot-scale fluidised bed installation. The gasifier height was 3.7 m and it had a square section with 0.2 m. Different types of wastes: pine, olive oil bagasse, and polyethylene (PE) were mixed with coal, keeping coal amount always higher than that of waste. The use of wastes did not give rise to any feeding system operational problems. The gasification medium was a mixture of steam and air, or oxygen. Syngas went through a cyclone to retain particulates and then through a fixed bed reactor with calcined dolomite. This reactor retained sulphur and halogens and also destroyed some tar. Afterwards, syngas went through another fixed bed reactor with a nickel based catalyst, whose main function was to promote further tar and heavier gaseous hydrocarbons reduction. Syngas was sampled and analysed in three sample points, after the cyclone (sample point 1), after the dolomite fixed bed reactor (sample point 2) and after the second fixed bed reactor with the Ni-based catalyst (sample point 3). This syngas cleaning configuration proved to be suitable to destroy completely tar and heavier gaseous hydrocarbons and also to ensure very low contents of H2S and NH3 that allowed syngas to be used in boilers and gas engines for most coal and waste blends.

An option for accomplishing that aim is the CO2 capture, utilization and storage technology (CCUS). It involves capturing CO2 from flue gas, transporting it, utilizing it for economically productive activities (CCU \u2013 carbon capture and utilization), and/or permanently disposing it in nonatmospheric sinks (CCS carbon capture and storage). Some technologies, such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) allow simultaneous CCUS [7], because CO2 is a well-recognized asset in the petroleum industry for the enhancement of oil extraction. Its use for enhanced oil recovery is a process that seeks to improve the flow and recovery rate of hydrocarbon from a reservoir (CO2-EOR) [5]. Unlike other options for CO2 utilization (e.g. use as a chemical feedstock), EOR can provide long-term storage and is able to increase the production of an economically valuable resource [6]. CO2-EOR is expected to produce additional 5\u201320% of the original oil in place (OOIP) [4] and it is also identified to have a strong potential to reduce the overall CCS cost, however the cost benefits are strongly dependent on the oil price and the considered EOR injection period [2]. CO2-EOR is usually a large-scale project and requires techno-economic evaluation before its deployment, a particularly important issue in this assessment is the availability of a low-cost source of CO2.

It is not an exhaustive review of all the issues and writing concerning civil nuclear power but has a specific scope outlined below (see Annex 1 for full Terms of Reference). Nuclear power is quite unlike both fossil fuels and renewable sources of electricity generation with a particular set of characteristics that may be beneficial or problematic. The main purpose of this report is to provide a succinct appraisal of key issues relevant to the plans for a new generation of reactors in the UK, namely:? safety? radioactive waste disposal? proliferation of nuclear weapons? economics of nuclear power? siting and planning of low carbon generation? employment ? issues in managing a low carbon grid? interactions between nuclear power and other low carbon technologiesThese issues are presented in separate sections as reviews of existing primary research and not as new research findings. The penultimate section, Chapter 11, presents new work by Tyndall Manchester on the carbon dioxide emissions implications of using gas rather than building a new series of nuclear power stations. We calculate the emissions output if the shortfall in electricity generation were to be met by the use of combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT). Alternative renewable energy sources are not considered as their direct emissions are negligible and similar to those from nuclear stations. A range of scenarios is presented for different combinations of rates and extent of nuclear construction and the availability and performance of carbon capture and storage technology.

The CLC of biomass is a way to generate negative CO2\u00a0emissions. However, interactions between ash and oxygen carriers are a tough challenge as biomass-derived ashes consist of large amounts of reactive ash-forming matter such as alkaline and alkali earth metals. As iron-based oxygen carriers are one of the most commonly used ones, the interaction of the pure iron oxide and biomass-derived ash-forming matter needs to be further understood to overcome the deactivating effects of ash components on the oxygen carriers. Even though ash components may exist in different forms, the effects of K- and Na-based carbonates, chlorides, nitrates, phosphates, and sulfates on the pure iron oxide were mainly investigated in this study. The effect of synthetic biomass-derived ash on the iron oxygen carriers was also investigated to reveal the phases causing agglomeration or deactivation of the oxygen carriers.

Medieval and early modern pits were located where coal outcropped or was close to the surface and was used only locally and on a small scale. But the development first of turnpike roads, then of canals and finally of railways (themselves fuelled by coal) enabled coal to replace water as the major source of energy. The influence of coal can still be seen in the present- day English landscape, and not just in the various lines of communication, many of which still exist. Although most of the collieries that have worked over the last three hundred years have now closed, sufficient remain, either as working pits or mining museums, to show what a typical colliery was like, with the various components of headgear, heapstead, winding-engine house, control room, screens building, pithead baths, etc. Alongside the pits was the accommodation for the colliery workforce and their families; initially colliers lived amongst the local community, but as larger pits were developed, purpose-built housing was erected specifically for the colliery communities. As well as the housing, these villages incorporated other elements, such as pigeon lofts, allotments and welfare clubs, for the miners' leisure time. Earlier in the twentieth century coal-handling facilities were a frequent sight. Now these have disappeared and the only major element of the end use of coal still visible in the landscape are the coal-fired power stations and their associated waste-ash piles; railways and shipping are now powered by oil, and many power stations also now use gas or nuclear power, although if carbon capture and storage (CCS) can be made economically viable, coal may yet come back into favour for providing large-scale power.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "cc8275692c896c010189faab2beaf1d75203915f", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 202695512}, "title": "Six Years of CO 2 Flux Measurements for a Moderately Grazed Mixed-Grass Prairie", "abstract": "The large area occupied by temperate grassland ecosystems makes it important to determine their strength as a carbon sink. The Bowen ratio/energy balance (BREB) technique was used to determine CO2 fluxes over a moderately grazed mixed-grass prairie at Mandan, North Dakota, USA, over a 6-year period from 1996 to 2001. Above-ground biomass and leaf area index (LAI) were measured about every 21 days throughout the growing period. Root biomass was determined to 1.1 m depth in mid-July each year. Peak aboveground biomass typically occurred between mid-July to early August and ranged from 782 kg/ha in 1998 to 2173 kg/ha in 1999. Maximum LAI ranged from 0.4 in 1998 to 0.9 in 1999. Root biomass ranged from 11.8 Mg/ha in 1997 to 17.4 Mg/ha in 1996. Maximum daily CO2 fluxes generally coincided with periods of maximum LAI and above-ground green biomass. The average time period for CO2 uptake was 5 May to 3 October. Annual CO2 fluxes ranged from a low of 13 g CO2/m 2 in 1998 to a high of 247 g CO2/m 2 in 2001, nearly a 20-fold difference, and averaged 108 g CO2/m . The cumulative annual flux over all 6 years was 646 g CO2/m 2 or 176 g CO2-C/m . These results indicate that the strength of the carbon sink for this moderately grazed prairie site is about 30 g CO2-C/m /yr, which is quite small, but considering that the site was grazed and still remains a sink for carbon, it is significant. Carbon dioxide flux measurements have shown grasslands to be a net sink for atmospheric CO2 (Kim and others 1992, Dugas and others 1999, Frank and others 2000, Frank and Dugas 2001, Sims and Bradford 2001, Suyker and Verma 2001). Tropical forests are the largest terrestrial biomass sink for C, containing about 40% of the total C stored in terrestrial ecosystems (Dixon and others 1994). Grassland ecosystems comprise about one fifth of the earth\u2019s land surface and contain more than 10% of the global C stocks (Eswaran and others 1993). Temperate-region grassland ecosystems are well suited for storing soil organic carbon because of their extensive fibrous root systems, which makes these ecosystems important C sinks that must be considered for balancing the global C budget (Rastetter and others 1992, Sundquist 1993, Gifford 1994, Schimel 1995, Keeling and others 1996, Batjes 1998, Fan and others 1998). Native grasslands are highly resilient due to the highly diverse mixture of species that are adapted to the harsh conditions common to temperate grasslands. These factors make grasslands effective sequesters of atmospheric CO2 even though they generally occupy landscape sites that have less productive soils than cropland and are found in regions that receive limited precipitation. Seasonal flux measurements have shown that grasslands are a sink for atmospheric CO2, especially during periods of peak biomass accumulation. Kim and others (1992) reported average daily CO2 fluxes for a prairie site dominated by warm-season tallgrasses of 4.1 g CO2/ m/day from May through October. During the grassland senescence phase, the CO2 budget was in balance with the atmosphere, but during droughts and after senescence, the grassland was a source of CO2 with a flux of nearly 3 g CO2/m /day. Dugas and others (1999) reported an annual CO2 flux for a tallgrass prairie site of 0.7 g CO2/m /day. Frank and Dugas (2001) estimated an annual CO2 flux for a nongrazed mixed-grass prairie of 167 g CO2/m . The generally low productivity of grassland soils and the low precipitation amounts and nitrogen availability limit the potential of grassland ecosystems to capture and store C (Cole 1996, Houghton and others 1999). Others claim that the carbon budgets of grasslands are near equilibrium (Sims and Singh 1978, Bruce and others 1999). Estimating carbon storage potential of grasslands is difficult and requires long-term measurements because of the extensive vegetation diversity and climate variability in which they occur. Assuming the CO2 budget for this moderately grazed prairie site is near equilibrium, the objective of this research was to determine the annual CO2 flux for a moderately grazed mixed-grass prairie", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "ec0bc22b6250a76894166af04c7fb5b0f4466a73", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2619097278", "CorpusId": 133739647}, "title": "Assessing the climate impacts of Chinese dietary choices using a telecoupled global food trade and local land use framework", "abstract": "Global emissions trajectories developed to meet the 20C temperature target are likely to rely on the widespread deployment of negative emissions technologies and/or the implementation of substantial terrestrial carbon sinks.

The combustion of fossil fuels for energy production and transportation is a large contributor to the problem. One of the ways to reduce the amounts of CO2 being released from combustion is carbon capture and storage (CCS). Post-combustion is the capturing method which has been deemed the easiest to apply to existing power plants in a short period of time. Absorption of CO2 by MEA is the most common method used in post-combustion carbon capture, but there are still many aspects of the process that are not fully understood. Understanding the absorption mechanisms will make it easier to make more economical and environmentally friendly choices in the future. In this thesis the oxidative degradation of monoethanolamine (MEA) has been studied using an open batch setup. The stability of MEA has been studied under different temperatures and concentrations of oxygen in the gas stream. These experiments give a matrix of experiments performed at 55, 65 and 75 \u00b0C, with oxygen concentrations of 6, 21, 50 and 98% in the gas stream. To monitor how well the experimental results could be trusted, the water balance was maintained throughout the experiments, and the pH was measured in the flasks capturing volatile degradation compounds. To get a detailed picture of the degradation, the weight percent of nitrogen and the CO2 concentration has been found in the end samples, and the alkalinity and MEA concentration was found for all the samples. 11 known degradation compounds have been monitored for the different experiments, and the conditions these compounds are formed at have been compared with the suggested reaction mechanisms. 4 of the products were analyzed as anions using Ion chromatography (IC), and 7 secondary reaction products were analyzed as part of a degradation mix in LC-MS. The dependency of these compounds to temperature and oxygen conditions has been discussed. The primary degradation compounds seems to show a more direct correlation to oxygen flow or temperature, while the secondary degradation reaction shows a bigger variation of temperature and oxygen dependency relative to the conditions of the experiments. Various analytical methods for determination of the known compounds were used to determine the concentration of the degradation compounds in the experiments.

Since the ability of different EU Member States and regions to facilitate and to benefit from CCS will most likely depend on local conditions in terms of current energy mix, fuel supply chains and distance to suitable storage locations, special emphasize is put on analyzing turn-over in capital stock of the existing power plant infrastructure, timing of investments and the infrastructural implications of large scale introduction of CCS on a regional perspective. The paper discusses the role of and requirements on CCS for meeting strict emission targets of 85% reduction while having a continued growth in electricity demand (according to EU projections). The results show that it is possible to meet an 85% CO2 reduction target by 2050, but this will require large contribution from CCS. As expected, regions which are currently high in carbon intensity and which are located nearby suitable storage sites will benefit mostly from CCS as an option.

Both sandstones contain similar grain size distributions, pore size distributions, and pore interconnectivity but differ in that the Nugget formation contains approximately half the porosity of the Bentheimer sandstone, and the pore network contains dead-end pores. scCO2 size distributions, strain calculations, and geometric contact angle measurements were used to characterize the curvature of scCO2 in different pore types between cycles. An increase in geometric contact angle was the greatest when advancement along the pore network of the same ganglion occurred between cycles while strain increased the most with pore-filling trapping. Moreover, Nugget sandstone results in a greater aggregated residual saturation and shows a clear increase in scCO2 sizes with an additional D-I cycle while scCO2 in the Bentheimer core shows a more complex response with some ganglion increasing and some decreasing in size with an additional D-I cycle.
