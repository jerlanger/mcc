These materials exhibit a large diversity of pore size and geometry, topology, surface area, and chemical functionality. MOFs are particularly promising materials for developing new technologies for capture and storage of greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide. Here we apply the three dimensional reference interaction site model (3D-RISM) molecular theory of solvation to study the interactions of CO2 and CH4 with the metal-organic material MIL-47. The 3D-RISM integral equations were solved to determine the three dimensional density correlation functions of the gas (solvent) relative to the atomic positions of the MIL-47 framework, treated as static solute sites. The computed solvent spatial distributions inside MIL-47 pores were used to identify whether or not there exist preferable binding sites and the binding free energy landscape for the gas of interest at low computational costs compared with other molecular modeling techniques, such as grand canonical Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. The 3D-RISM formalism was applied to pure CO2, pure CH4, and binary mixtures of these gases of various compositions under different pressure conditions. The results indicate that both gases bind very weakly to MIL-47 and that this material exhibits nearly vanishing CO2/CH4 selectivity. The 3D-RISM computations presented here can be extended to investigate the physical adsorption of gases on other MOFs and nanoporous materials, providing an alternative low-cost computational approach to study gas capture and storage in nanoporous materials in general and, in particular, to determine the binding free-energy landscape in these systems.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "34ea0b1a53148b4c480825f3ec18fa7e15ac2b53", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 237251279}, "title": "Revisio\u0301n sobre captura y almacenamiento de carbono para ingenieri\u0301a de la construccio\u0301n", "abstract": "Global warming and climatic changes due to pollution have triggered the global efforts to reduce the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.

We suggest several clarifications that could usefully be provided, either in the guidance document, or in subsidiary documents. Specifically, we suggest the establishment of a process of continual review of the realistic capacity of carbon dioxide storage reservoirs and the criteria for introducing new carbon storage reservoirs. We further suggest that to allow for the rapid rate of generation of new scientific information, the following are needed. First, an explicit, quantitative statement of the timescale that government considers sufficient for a reservoir t store carbon dioxide securely. Second, the inclusion in the guidance document of plans to accelerate the release into the public domain of seismic, borehole log, well injection test, and drilling record data generated by the private sector. Third, an explicit statement of government\u2019s view on the extent to which bio-fuel power stations should be covered by regulations requiring carbon capture readiness. Finally, the production of a companion document giving similar guidance for the retro-fitting of carbon capture and storage systems at existing power stations. We also suggest that the guidance document could benefit from being updated in a number of ways, in the light of the Secretary of State\u2019s additional proposals. Specifically, we suggest that, if different regulations are to apply to coal and natural gas, it would be useful for the guidance document to mention the two fuels separately. If some electricity generators are to be required to undertake carbon capture and storage from start-up of new facilities, the advice in the guidance document, that they do not need to commit themselves to using a particular storage reservoir at that stage, is no longer correct. The guidance document could usefully include measures to counter any disincentives to private-sector funding of carbon capture and storage research. We propose that the same review process that continually reassesses the realistic capacity of carbon dioxide storage reservoirs and the criteria for introducing new carbon storage reservoirs, may also need to keep under continual review the list of issues that applicants for power station construction permits can usefully address. Finally, we suggest that it would be helpful for applicants to provide details of their plans for monitoring of CO2 during and after its injection into a reservoir. 1 About us The Institute of Theoretical Geophysics is a research group within the Departments of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics and Earth Sciences, in Cambridge University.

In the scope of this work pseudo steady state component models of a supercritical power plant were developed as well as the composite model that fully represents a supercritical power plant. Two modes, design and operational were developed for the composite model to be able to simulate part load in addition with turbine following control. A daily cycle simulation was analysed and sensitivity studies were made on the boiler efficiency and on the reheat vapour temperature. The mathematical modelling was implemented in the commercial software gPROMS. This is a highly complex system where all the interactions and all the recirculation of information that appears in the steam cycle were studied and successfully captured by the model. The sensitivity analysis shows that an increase in the reheat vapour temperature improves the power production and the gross efficiency.

Their size, shape and surface determine the activity of the molecules incorporated. Two main groups of nanoparticles are applied as drug delivery systems: the polymeric nanoparticles, such as liposomes, dendrimers and micelles, and the inorganic particles, including gold, iron oxide, silica and graphene. The aim of this review is to discuss nanoparticles as platforms of molecular delivery in diagnosis and therapy. Discussion Dendrimers and liposomes incorporate hydrophobic and hydrophilic agents, but present low biodegradation and leaking of the agents, respectively. Micelles are suitable for hydrophobic molecules, but may use toxic materials. Superparamagnetic iron oxides are efficient agents in magnetic resonance and easily biodegradable; however, at high doses this particle promotes intense oxidative stress. Gold particles are very useful as sensor particles, but they are immunogenic. Silica particles are easy to synthesise and functionalise; however, very less information about their biodegradation is available. The graphene structures, such as carbon nanotubes, have many interesting properties; however, they are very toxic and accumulative. Conclusion Nanoparticles are very promising as new diagnosis and pharmacotherapy tools. However, the disadvantages associated with them must be overcome in order to find completely safe and efficient systems. Introduction Nanoparticles are polymeric colloidal systems ranging from 10 to 1000 nm, which are able to deliver compounds to the cells1. They can be used alone or associated to several molecules for the treatment and diagnosis of cancer, autoimmune and congenital diseases. For example, showing an increase in the efficacy of these drugs and, mainly, minimising the adverse events. The nanoparticles are classified in two main groups: nanocapsules and nanospheres. The nanocapsules have a polymeric membrane and a cavity where the therapeutic agent can be incorporated, while nanospheres have a polymeric matrix where the therapeutic agent can be adsorbed or dispersed2. The size, shape and surface of the nanoparticles are important factors to determine the pharmacological activity of the therapeutic agents incorporated. Particles less than 5\u201310 nm in size are quickly removed from circulation and eliminated by the kidney, while particles sized 15 \u03bcm or more tend to accumulate in organs, such as liver, spleen and bone marrow. Micelles, as an exception, have a reduced size and a half-life of 5 days, due to their ability to escape renal filtration3. The biodistribution and uptake of nanoparticles by the tissues are defined specifically by the type of cell4. In addition, cells capture particles less than 20 nm by pinocytosis and less than 100 nm by phagocytosis. The immune response is affected by the capture mechanism influencing drug amounts delivered to the target tissue5. Particles ranging from 10 to 200 nm have shown better efficacy in the majority of the drug distribution systems6. Discussion Two main groups of nanoparticles, the polymeric and inorganic particles, are applied as drug delivery systems (DDS). Polymeric nanoparticles include liposomes, dendrimers and micelles. Inorganic nanoparticles include gold, iron oxide, silica and grapheme7. These systems will be described below. Delivery systems Micelles Micelles are colloidal dispersions of 5\u2013100 nm formed by amphipathic molecules that present a hydrophilic exterior and a hydrophobic interior (Figure 1)8. The hydrophobic nucleus allows storage of a large dose of hydrophobic compounds, which would require toxic amounts of organic solvents/surfactants to be diluted9. Micelles preferentially accumulate in tumours because of the leaky vasculature of these tissues and poor drainage; this is called the enhanced permeability and retention effect9. It helps to concentrate the therapeutic substance in the target tissue. Another strategy to increase tissue specificity and cell uptake is to conjugate specific molecules to the micelles surface9. Lipid nanoparticles are synthesised by fusion-emulsification; this technique consists of prior fusion of the lipid, incorporating the active principle by dissolution or dispersion. Then, the lipid phase is emulsified in an aqueous phase containing a surfactant.

These strategies areaffected by high energy penalty and high investment. Therefore, it is imperative toassess the viability of these energy systems and further identify niche problem areasassociated with energy efficiency and economic performance improvement. The current research work has two parts. The first part presents techno-economic investigation of thermochemical conversion of biomass into the production of fuels (Fischer-Tropsch liquid or methanol) and electricity. The work encompasses centralised bio-oil integrated gasification plant, assuming that the bio-oil is supplied from distributed pyrolysis plant. Bio-oil is a high energy density liquid derived from biomass fast pyrolysis process, providing advantages in transport and storage. Various bio-oil based integrated gasification system configurations were studied. The configurations were varied based on oxygen supply units, once-through and full conversion configurations and a range of capacities from small to large scale. The second part of this thesis considers integration of various CO2 abatement strategies in coal integrated gasification systems. The CO2 abatement strategies under consideration include CO2 capture and storage, CO2 capture and reuse as well as CO2 reuse from flue gas. These facilities are integrated into cogeneration or polygeneration systems. The cogeneration concept refers to the production of combined heat and power while polygeneration concept is an integrated system converting one or more feedstocks into three or more products. Polygeneration is advocated in this work attributed to its high efficiency and lower emission. Furthermore, it can generate a balanced set of products consisting of fuels, electricity and chemicals. It is regarded as a promising way of addressing the future rapidly growing energy demands. A holistic approach using systematic analytical frameworks comprisingsimulation modelling, process integration and economic analysis has been developedand adopted consistently throughout the study for the techno-economic performanceevaluation of decarbonised fossil and bio-oil based systems. Important designmethodology, sensitivity analysis of process parameters and process systemmodifications are proposed. These are to enhance the efficiency as well as lower theeconomic and environmental impacts of polygeneration systems. A shortcutmethodology has also been developed as a decision-making tool for effective selectionfrom a portfolio of CO2 abatement options and integrated systems.

Controlling atmospheric CO2 emissions is thus essential to mitigate the environmental and socio-economic consequences related to these changes. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) was proposed as one possible option to control anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and is particularly viable at CO2 point sources such as coal-fuelled power plants. CCS was tested and applied globally in a variety of geological and top-side settings within the past decade, with varying success. In Longyearbyen, the main settlement on the Norwegian high-Arctic Svalbard archipelago, CO2 may be captured at the local coal-fuelled power plant and injected into an unconventional siliciclastic target aquifer. The target aquifer, within the Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic Kapp Toscana Group, comprises an up to 300 m thick sequence of tight, naturally fractured sandstones inter-bedded with siltstones and shales. During the Early Cretaceous, igneous intrusions, collectively classified as the Diabasodden Suite, were emplaced in the target aquifer. The pilot-scale Longyearbyen CCS project envisions only modest storage volumes of CO2, with the top-side CO2 storage requirements determined by the annual CO2 emissions from the local coal-fuelled power plant (c. 60 000 tons). As part of this PhD study, the geologically complex target aquifer was characterized and represented in a static geologic reservoir model. Fieldwork (e.g. structural and stratigraphic logs, geological mapping), borehole (e.g. drill core logs and plugs, wireline logs, water injection tests, vertical-seismic-profiling survey) and regional geophysical (e.g. 2D seismic, digital elevation model, magnetic data) data sets were used as input. Two main themes relating directly to the geological heterogeneity of the target aquifer were addressed in detail: (1) the natural fracture network, and, (2) the presence of igneous intrusions. Water injection tests, wireline logging and fracture mapping, in drill cores and at outcrops, all indicate that the tight heterolithic siliciclastic target aquifer is highly fractured, and that the pre-existing natural fracture network is critical for the injectivity of fluids.

To ensure that CCS is safe and successful, an efficient monitoring program that will prevent storage reservoir leakage and drinking water contamination in groundwater aquifers must be implemented. However, geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS) sites are not completely certain about the geological properties, which makes it difficult to predict the behavior of the injected gases, CO2 brine leakage rates through wellbores, and CO2 plume migration. Significant effort is required to observe how CO2 behaves in reservoirs. A key question is: Will the CO2 injection and storage behave as expected, and can we anticipate leakages? History matching of reservoir models can mitigate uncertainty towards a predictive strategy. It could prove challenging to develop a set of history matching models that preserve geological realism. A new Bayesian evidential learning (BEL) protocol for uncertainty quantification was released through literature, as an alternative to the model-space inversion in the history-matching approach. Consequently, an ensemble of previous geological models was developed using a prior distribution\u2019s Monte Carlo simulation, followed by direct forecasting (DF) for joint uncertainty quantification. The goal of this work is to use prior models to identify a statistical relationship between data prediction, ensemble models, and data variables, without any explicit model inversion.

In order to mitigate climate change, deep reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will be required in the coming decades. This necessity is at odds with fossil fuels\u2019 overwhelming dominance as an energy source. By capturing and storing CO2 in sinks other than the atmosphere, atmospheric CO2 levels can be stabilized or lowered while fossil fuels and their associated infrastructure are phased out more slowly and thus at lower social cost. Given the extent of emissions reductions needed to stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations and the inertia involved in shifting the world's primary energy sources, carbon capture and storage (CCS) will likely constitute a substantial share of emissions reductions in the nearto medium-term. Nearly all current research on CCS focuses on capturing CO2 from large, stationary sources, such as power plants, as it is produced. Such plans usually entail capturing CO2 from flue gas, compressing it, and transporting it via pipeline to a sequestration site. In contrast, the research proposed here focuses on capturing CO2 directly from ambient air. The capture unit can be located at a favorable sequestration site, avoiding the need for a CO2-transportation infrastructure. This strategy has the advantage that CO2 emissions from any sector can be captured: power plants which are difficult to retrofit, point sources in locations where new infrastructure is expensive or impractical to build, and diffuse sources such as automobiles. Previous research by our group indicated that dilute aqueous alkali-metal solutions derived from CaOand MgO-rich waste streams (e.g. steel slag and concrete waste) effectively removed CO2 from ambient air. The economic of CO2 extraction from air using these wastes can be favorable under certain conditions, but the mass of carbon that can be captured and sequestered is small. The aim of this research is to design and analyze an industrial scale system for capturing CO2 from ambient air that uses well-understood technologies available today, that is simple and inexpensive, and that is scalable to handle a significant fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. With these goals, the scheme depicted in Figure 1 has been devised as a basis for analysis. In it, air is forced through a cooling-tower-like structure where an aqueous sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution is sprayed and collected by gravity. The NaOH droplets absorb CO2 from the air, yielding NaHCO3(aq). The collected solution is piped to a batch reactor for a sodium-calcium exchange process. The regenerated NaOH is recycled to the contactor and the CaCO3 formed is sent to the Calciner. Upon heating the CaCO3, CO2 is driven off in a pure stream and pressurized for sequestration. The CaO formed is then recycled to the Na-Ca exchanger. The Na-Ca exchange process is well-understood and currently used at industrial scales in the pulp and paper industry with almost the precise parameters required for this scheme (Adams, 1989). The calcining (regenerating the CaO) and hydroxylation steps are also well-understood processes used at industrial scales in the pulp and paper industry (ibid.) and during cement manufacture. The contactor is the least-specified component of the system and, as such, the subject of this research. A diagram of the proposed contactor is shown in Figure 2. The design is feasible in principle \u2013 CO2 capture at ambient concentration with NaOH solution has been demonstrated", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "5c6c4c2ec4edad37353da4dba0b39cda586a674d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2779789267", "DOI": "10.1080/01430750.2017.1422145", "CorpusId": 134111096}, "title": "Feasibility study of carbon capture and storage on NLC India Ltd", "abstract": "ABSTRACT India is one of the largest growing economies in the world.

Here in the North East of Scotland, UK and Scottish Governments, along with project developer Pale Blue Dot Energy and Total are providing match funding to the European Commission\u2019s Connecting Europe Facilities fund to progress feasibility work on the Acorn CCS project. As society continues to drive an expectation beyond hydrocarbons, what proposal might the North East of Scotland offer in response?\n To meet ambitious emissions reduction targets, the UK must envisage radical changes to the energy economy. Already affecting power generation, these changes must drive further into transport and domestic/industrial energy consumption. Two technologies which may play a part in the decarbonisation of the UK energy business are CCUS and the use of Hydrogen as an energy carrier and energy store, with several studies showing that clean hydrogen is potentially the lowest cost route to meeting UK emission targets in multiple sectors. This builds on the UK\u2019s world class gas network infrastructure, which can be repurposed to avoid becoming stranded, avoiding the enormous expense of increasing the capacity of the electricity transmission network, much of which would lie idle during the summer. The UK gas network carries approximately three times more energy than the electricity network, at one third the unit cost to consumers, and meets winter peaks that are five times greater.\n Different to previous CCUS projects, and having the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA)\u2019s first carbon dioxide appraisal and storage licence award, ACORN is an opportunity to evaluate a brownfield CCUS solution to capture, transport and store post-combustion CO2, combined with an upside through emerging pre-combustion CO2 capture technology relating to the production and sale of bulk hydrogen produced from natural gas with a zero-emission target.

The objective of this thesis is to present several methods and processes to separate carbon dioxide from flue gases for sustainable sequestration. As a result the increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere by emission can be reduced. The sequestration can either be terrestrial or marine. There are four options for terrestrial sequestration: 1) in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, 2) in saline formations and aquifers, 3) in minerals and 4) in unminable coal seams. For marine storage the carbon dioxide either dissolves in the seawater or forms lakes of hydrates in depths below 3000m. Health, safety and environmental issues have to be considered seriously. First of all, it is necessary to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas after combustion, in order to optimize the utilization of limited storage capacities. When capturing carbon dioxide the following processes will be discussed: 1) absorption using monoethanolamine, 2) pressure swing adsorption, 3) gas separation membranes and 4) the carbonation-calcination process. These separation processes lead to intense facility costs, which undergo an economic evaluation in this thesis.

An overall energy policy is suggested for use by political leaders, along with specific goals on climate change and national security. This report proposes a timetable by which the climate change and national security goals should be accomplished. Converting these political goals into a cost-effective energy plan that would continue to get long-term political support would be the task of the technical community. A generic process is described which applies to all future energy systems and would give guidance to the technical community on how to create a mix of energy sources and conservation. This generic process is then tested on three possible energy futures. One energy future proposes that all of our electricity should come from renewable sources within 10 years. It is shown to be inadequate and would exacerbate environmental risks. The second possible energy future adds far more nuclear energy and coal plants with carbon capture and sequestration to the above renewable-only proposal. This second plan was a significant improvement over the all-renewable energy proposal, but does not address how transportation might be accomplished in the future. Converting coal to liquid fuels is identified as the major means to produce liquid fuels, as long as non-carbon dioxide emitting sources of process heat/hydrogen are employed in this coal conversion process. The third proposal, called an Energy Family approach, places first emphasis on conservation and then creates a mix of energy sources, renewable, nuclear, coal, natural gas, and some oil that could meet all the energy demands of a modern society, while staying within environmental and national security limits. This third approach appears to be most likely to get continuing support. There can be significant progress through \u201cSecond Generation\u201d conservation, which extracts much more energy from our existing electrical generation and transmission system. Coal would have to undergo a major transformation from producing electricity to producing liquid fuels for transportation. Transportation and space heating and cooling would be far more electrified. Nuclear power would have to be expanded to replace many of the phased out coal plants, to provide electricity for transportation, and to supply high-temperature process heat and hydrogen. Long-term programs need to be put in place to assure nuclear power\u2019s continuing contribution. Finally, energy storage is a component which is often overlooked, but is essential.

The most dominant source of anthropogenic CO2 contributing to the rise in atmospheric concentration since the industrial revolution is the combustion of fossil fuels. These emissions are expected to result in global climate change with potentially severe consequences for ecosystems and mankind. In this context, these emissions should be restrained in order to mitigate climate change. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technological concept to reduce the atmospheric emissions of CO2 that result from various industrial processes, in particular from the use of fossil fuels (mainly coal and natural gas) in power generation and from combustion and process related emissions in industrial sectors. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) regards CCS as \u201can option in the portfolio of mitigation actions\u201d to combat climate change (IPCC 2005). However, the deployment of CO2 capture at power plants and large industrial sources may influence local and transboundary air pollution, i.e. the emission of key atmospheric emissions such as SO2, NOX, NH3, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), and Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10). Both positive as negative impacts on overall air quality when applying CCS are being suggested in the literature. The scientific base supporting both viewpoints is rapidly advancing. The potential interaction between CO2 capture and air quality targets is crucial as countries are currently developing GHG mitigation action plans. External and unwanted trade-offs regarding air quality as well as co-benefits when implementing CCS should be known before rolling out this technology on a large scale. The goal of this chapter is to provide an overview of the existing scientific base and provide insights into ongoing and needed scientific endeavours aimed at expanding the science base. The chapter outline is as follows. We first discuss the basics of CO2 capture, transport and storage in section 2. In section 3, we discuss the change in the direct emission profile of key atmospheric pollutants when equipping power plants with CO2 capture. Section 4 expands on atmospheric emissions in the life cycle of CCS concepts. We provide insights in section 5 into how air quality policy and GHG reduction policy may interact in the Netherlands and the European Union.

Higher levels of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere\nleads to a raise of the average temperature on earth, which results in disasters such as drought,\nstorms and flooding. Carbon capture and storage is therefore a necessary technology to develop,\nespecially for fossil fuels but also for biomass. With carbon capture and storage from fossil fuels the\nemissions can at the very best be reduced to zero but it is not possible to remove carbon dioxide\nfrom the atmosphere, this is made possible by using biomass combined with storage.

The storage process relies on the effectiveness of safely retaining the injected supercritical fluid in deep underground formations over the long term through a number of trapping mechanisms that include structural, residual, dissolution, and mineral trapping. Improved fundamental understanding of these processes is expected to contribute toward better conceptual models, improved numerical models, more accurate assessment of storage capacities, and optimized placement strategies. It is known from reported studies in literature that the natural heterogeneity of typical sedimentary formations has significant effect on the propagation of the CO2 plume, eventually accumulating mobile phase underneath the caprock. From core flooding experiments in reservoir engineering, it is also known that contrasts in capillary threshold pressure due to different pore size can affect the flow paths of the invading non-wetting fluid. This consequently influences the buildup of non-wetting phase (NWP) at interfaces between geological facies. However, since fully characterizing the geologic variability at all relevant scales and making observations on the spatial and temporal distribution of the migration and trapping of supercritical CO2 is not practical, studying these trapping processes at a fundamental level is not feasible in field settings. To provide insight into the impact of heterogeneous systems on the flow dynamics and trapping efficiency of supercritical CO2 under drainage and imbibition conditions, an experimental investigation is conducted at the meter scale in synthetic sand reservoirs packed in quasi-two-dimensional flow-cells. Through an experimental approach that mimics the interplay of governing forces at deep reservoir conditions via application of surrogate fluids, a series of immiscible displacement experiments is performed to observe the preferential entrapment of NWP in well-defined heterogeneous porous media. Each experiment consisted of a drainage event simulating the injection of supercritical CO2 into a brine-wetted reservoir, followed by a gravity relaxation period characterized by spontaneous imbibition at the trailing edge of the plume. Spatial and temporal variations of NWP saturation represent important features to evaluate capillary trapping; for this reason x-ray attenuation analysis is used as a non-destructive technique that allows a precise measurement of phase saturations throughout the entire flow domain.

Crucial points for a sustainable and future-proof CCUS procedure are reliability and cost efficiency of the pipeline transport network, particularly concerning corrosion risks under varying amounts of impurities and moisture in the CO2 stream. Recent studies have shown that even high alloyed steels might be susceptible to general and/or localized corrosion caused by condensates [1, 2] . In the context of CLUSTER project [3] \u2013 German acronym for impacts of impurities in CO2 streams captured from different sources in a regional cluster on transport, injection and storage \u2013 studies on corrosion mechanism of oxidizing, reductive and mixed atmospheres towards transport pipeline steel were carried out. Due to the absence of certified benchmarks for upper limits, systematic experiments, based on thermodynamic calculations, with impurities in the CO2 stream were performed. In this study, SO2, NO2 and O2 acted as corrosive components for oxidation processes (Oxyfuel, Post-combustion), while H2S and H2 for reductive atmosphere (Pre-combustion) were applied [4] . The employed moisture content in all experiments was 50 ppmV [5] . The experimental setting consists of two units, a gas supply system, providing the experiment with up to 9 different gases simultaneously, and a high pressure reactor, equipped with a load frame for simulating stress cracking conditions on the pipeline wall [6] . The experiments were operated in a circulation flow system using a pressure of 10 MPa and a temperature range of 278 K \u2264 T \u2264 313 K, according to the ambient temperature [7] for terrestrial or subterranean pipelines. To determine the corrosion rate the experiments were performed in a time scale of 100 h, 300 h and 1000 h. Based on results of previous work [4] X70 (1.8977), a ferritic-perlitic carbon steel, was selected and specimens were ground. Characterization of corrosion products was carried out by optical microscopy, WLI, (GI)XRD, SEM/EDX and FIB. Due to the applied moisture to the stream, in combination with the impurities an acidic atmosphere in the experiments was generated. However, no acid condensation could be detected, attributed to the low moisture content of 50 ppmV. Comparing specimens braced by the load frame with unstrained ones leads to the conclusion that there is no influence by tensile stress (up to 50 Nm/mm2) towards layer formation or cracking, regardless of the employed gas atmosphere or the temperature. However, a high impact for the corrosion behavior in the high pressure experiments had the factor temperature.

Yet, even though the deployment of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, has grown considerably in the last decades, its behavior is still intermittent and requires of additional energy backup solutions to meet the power requirements of the consumers. Conventional coal-fired power plants need therefore to operate more frequently in part load than in the past, providing larger amounts of balancing power. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) units installed to such power stations need to be able to respond fast and dynamically to the required power plant load fluctuations, which is regarded nowadays as a major obstacle limiting their deployment. At the Institute of Combustion and Power Plant Technology (IFK) of the University of Stuttgart, the 230 kWth Calcium Looping test facility has been modified in order to operate with a bubbling to turbulent fluidized bed (BFB/TFB) carbonator and a circulating fluidized bed (CFB) regenerator. This configuration allows to decouple flue gas and solid circulation between reactors, enabling operation of the system in full load and in different part load scenarios, down to very low flue gas loads.

COMSOL multiphysics software was used for the numerical study, and first, laboratory scale uniaxial stress\u2013strain behaviour of both geopolymer and OPC was validated numerically. The model was then extended to study the triaxial mechanical behaviour under different salinity (0\u201330% NaCl) and confining pressures (0\u201315\u00a0MPa) conditions. Based on the results, it was noticed that UCS of geopolymer increases with salinity due to the high resistance against alkali leaching in saline water compared to fresh water. The UCS of OPC increases with salinity up to 10% NaCl, and then it reduces with any further increase in salinity. The UCS of geopolymer is 6% to 66% higher than that of OPC depending on the salinity conditions and geopolymer possesses higher UCS than OPC for any given salinity condition. COMSOL multiphysics numerical software predicted the stress\u2013strain behaviour of geopolymer and OPC accurately up to yield point.

The efficiency of conversion of the chemical energy in the fuel to DC electricity is 75-80% and is a result of zero entropy change for this reaction and the fixed chemical potentials of C and CO{sub 2}. This is about twice as efficient as other forms power production processes that utilize solid fuels such as petroleum coke or coal. These range from 30-40% for coal fired conventional subcritical or supercritical boilers to 38-42% for IGCC plants. A wide range of carbon-rich solids including activated carbons derived from natural gas, petroleum coke, raw coal, and deeply de-ashed coal have been evaluated with similar conversion results. The rate of electricity production has been shown to correlate with disorder in the carbon structure. This report provides a preliminary independent assessment of the economic potential of DCFC for competitive power generation. This assessment was conducted as part of a Director's Research Committee Review of DCFC held at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) onmore\u00a0\u00bb April 9, 2004. The key question that this assessment addresses is whether this technology, which appears to be very promising from a scientific standpoint, has the potential to be successfully scaled up to a system that can compete with currently available power generation systems that serve existing electricity markets. These markets span a wide spectrum in terms of the amount of power to be delivered and the competitive cost in that market. For example, DCFC technology can be used for the personal power market where the current competition for delivery of kilowatts of electricity is storage batteries, for the distributed generation market where the competition for on-site power generation in the range of 0.5 to 50 MW is small engines fueled with natural gas or liquid fuels or in the bulk power markets supplied usually by remote central station power plants with capacities of 250-1250 MW that deliver electricity to customers via the transmission and distribution grid. New power generation technology must be able to offer a significant cost advantage over existing technologies serving the same market to attract the interest of investors that are needed to provide funding for the development, demonstration, and commercialization of the technology. That path is both lengthy and expensive. One of the key drivers for any new power generation technology is the relative amount of pollutant emissions of all types, particularly those that are currently regulated or may soon be regulated. The new focus on greenhouse gas emissions offers a window of opportunity to DCFC technology because of its much higher conversion efficiency and the production of a very concentrated stream of CO{sub 2} in the product gas. This should offer a major competitive advantage if CO{sub 2} emissions are constrained by regulation in the future. The cost of CO{sub 2} capture, liquefaction, and pressurization has the potential to be much less costly with DCFC technology compared to other currently available forms of fossil fuel power generation.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "e96504f259e5070b1bc657367af286b13749989a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1990725376", "DOI": "10.1002/GHG.1482", "CorpusId": 108570756}, "title": "The future is looking bright", "abstract": "After years of talk, false starts and financial sticking points, carbon capture storage and utilization (CCSU) seems to have come into its own in 2014.

In the past few decades, major efforts have been made to develop and demonstrate large-scale capture of CO2 from industry and energy. To speed up implementation, more efforts are being made to reduce energy losses and energy costs, as well as expand promising solutions. However, one of the main obstacles to implementation remains the fate of these huge carbon dioxide flows. Although CO2 storage has been proven to be the main option to ensure permanent storage of the amount of CO2 to be captured, the integration of CO2 capture and storage may be a challenge, especially in the short term, due to the distance between the source and the sink. The time and scale required for such geological sinks do not match. Although it is not expected to be as effective as CO2 storage, the use of CO2 is still an interesting sink of captured CO2 because it creates opportunities for new sources of income. In addition, consider using CO2 for small flows, which makes it an interesting solution for early deployment. There are many possible ways to convert carbon dioxide into useful and hopefully more sustainable chemicals and fuels. For example, converting carbon dioxide into polyols can produce more sustainable elastomers, fibers, flexible foams, adhesives, sealants, inks, paints and coatings. Another route that can be considered is to convert CO2 into valuable energy carriers, such as methane, methanol, etc. This may be an attractive CCU solution, while also solving global warming and hydrogen or renewable energy storage issues.

Methane concentration in the atmosphere is rising continuously, prompting the need for a better understanding of freshwater methane sources and sinks. To date, the global methane budget is based on upscaling emissions from individual lakes resulting in erroneous freshwater methane emission estimates. Methane is produced in the anoxic sediments of lakes and is emitted to the atmosphere via different pathways (Figure 1). These include diffusion, ebullition (bubbling), storage flux and advection through aquatic vegetation, all regulated by different physical, chemical, and biological factors. As a result, methane fluxes significantly vary both within and across systems. Due to its stochastic nature, ebullition is ever challenging to quantify and is generally disregarded from the global methane budget. To improve methane emission estimates from freshwater, process-based models can be used that enable the simulation of each pathway separately. The aim of this study is to simulate methane emissions from a focus site. This is done through the development of a methane module in the Aquatic Ecodynamics (AED) modelling library which is applied to Lake Kinneret. Whilst Lake Kinneret is a single focus of this study, applying the developed methane model to a site with previously existing monitoring and modelling data will contribute to the building of an open-source general methane model. In this study, the one-dimensional General Lake Model (GLM) was coupled to the AED modelling library to simulate the thermal dynamics and dissolved oxygen concentration of Lake Kinneret. The methane sources and sinks in the AED carbon module include diffusion, aerobic oxidation, and atmospheric gas exchange. To simulate ebullition, a new algorithm was added to the model. The ebullitive flux in this algorithm varies according to temperature and water level changes. The bubbles released from the sediments either dissolve in the water column or are directly emitted to the atmosphere. The vertical temperature profile of the lake was successfully reproduced, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.5 \u00b0C (~5%). The model has appropriately resolved the oxygen dynamics, except for the metalimnetic oxygen minimum, with an RMSE of 2.99 mg/L (~20%). The RMSE between the observed and simulated methane concentrations was 56 mmol/m3 (~10%). The great annual and within system variations of the methane fluxes are captured well by the model. However, surface methane concentrations are repeatedly overestimated during holomixis. Lastly, the model simulates the seasonality of ebullition well, however, it doesn\u2019t capture its stochastic nature reported in the literature. Process-based models have the ability to account for the variability in lake characteristics and capture the interannual and within system variations in methane emissions. However, to move away from site-specific ebullition models, it is crucial to develop new general ways to parametrise ebullition, enabling its applicability across a gradient of systems.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "6fabd73bfc3c173158966f89dbd7d5c3037f0029", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 224834921}, "title": "SYSTEMS ASPECTS OF GHG MITIGATION: OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are an essential component of the lowest cost pathways for limiting atmospheric CO2 equivalent concentrations to 450 ppm.

Two kinds of coal particles (a high-volatile bituminous coal / a lignite coal) are injected in a drop-tube furnace, ignited and burned in quiescent O2/N2 and O2/CO2 atmospheres with oxygen mole fraction varying from 20% to 100%. Ignition delay time, particle life time and particle surface temperature are calculated to analyse the combustion behaviour of the single coal particle. Transient simulations are carried out based on Discrete Phase Model (DPM). The predicted results are in good agreement with the experimental data and give the details of combustion process. Further, predictions of NOx emissions are made to understand the influence of different gas atmosphere and oxygen mole fraction. This includes both thermal-NOx and fuelNOx formation mechanisms. It is argued that the NOx emissions in both O2/N2 and O2/CO2 atmospheres are the result of competitions between the maximum particle temperature and the burning time. INTRODUCTION Coal is widely used for energy production across the world and pulverised combustion is perhaps the most common technology for utilising coal energy. Despite serious emissions caused by coal combustion, it is still and, most probably, will continue to be amongst the main resources for power generation [3][4]. Coal combustion which involves devolatilization, char combustion and gas phase reactions is a multi-phase, multi-scale and multi-component process [2]. Types of coal and the operation condition of reactors are also the key factors in its combustion behaviour. Further, the complex chemical processes involved in coal combustion need to be explored. Due to the increasing concerns about global warming, carbon dioxide emission by coal combustion is now a serious issue. Different methods have been developed for carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce the CO2 emission from coal-fired power plants. Pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture, oxyfuel combustion and chemical looping are four main CCS technologies [5]. Among these, the oxy-fuel combustion is a near-zero emission technology and the most promising one for power station utilisation [5]. The replacement of air with O2/CO2 leads to modified distributions NOMENCLATURE K [kmol/ms] Reaction rate k Reaction rate constant c [kmol/m] Concentration A Pre-exponential factor E [J/kmol] Activation energy T [K] Temperature R Universal gas constant X Mole fraction a Oxygen reaction order b Temperature exponent d Reaction order e Reaction order Special characters \u03b1 Distribution coefficient Subscripts s Solid x Composition of chemical element H y Composition of chemical element O R Reactant ox Oxidant of temperature and species, as well as radiation flux, resulting from the property differences between N2 and CO2. This also results in changes in NOx formation and reduction in the flame temperature [6]. Nitrogen oxides, including nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrous oxide (N2O) are mostly produced through the oxidation of the molecular nitrogen in air (thermal NOx) and the organically bound nitrogen in the coal (fuel NOx) [7]. NOx formed from molecular nitrogen and hydrocarbon fragments resulting from the devolatilization process near the reaction zone of flame (prompt NOx) accounts for less than 5% of the total NOx formed [8], and is usually neglected in modelling. In a combustion system, including pulverized combustion, the formation and destruction of NOx emissions are influenced by several factors such as fuel properties and, combustion conditions e.g. temperature of reaction and the fuel\u2013air ratio [9]. A series of work on NOx emissions in coal combustion was conducted by Lookwood and his co-workers in 1990s [10][11][12]. Replacing the background gas N2 by CO2 can limit the NOx emissions formed at high temperatures from nitrogen of the combustion air, and then the formation of NOx is mainly due 12th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "d6d2e67bda5217cccc074eedd33163fda7f9cb04", "externalIds": {"MAG": "160320422", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-4939-0545-4_7", "CorpusId": 127046644}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage: In the Quest for Clean Fossil Energy", "abstract": "The main objective of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is to prevent CO2 from entering the atmosphere by capturing CO2 from large industrial sources and securely storing it in various carbon sinks.

Fossil fuel supplies more than 80% of primary energy in China and coal contributes two thirds. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), as the only technology to decarbonise fossil based energy, is therefore important for China's transition to a low-carbon economy.

As the energy demand increases, so does the production of climate-altering CO2 emission. Biomass power plants have emerged as a low carbon power generation alternative, utilizing agricultural and industrial waste. Biomass power plants have the potential of being a carbon-negative power generation technology in the near future by integrating carbon and capture storage (bio-CCS). The objective of this paper is to analyze and map potential CO2 emission in the processes of biomass power plants from gasification and firing or co-firing technology, then recommend suitable carbon capture technology based on the biomass power plant characteristics in Indonesia. The CO2 emission to be captured in the gasification process is 11-15% of the producer gas, while in co-firing it is 7-24% of the flue gas stream. Using biomass instead of coal in power plants reduces the electric efficiency and increases the plant\u2019s in-house emission, but when analyzed in a wider boundary system it is apparent that the net GWP and CO2 emission of biomass power plants are way smaller than coal power plant, moreover when equipped with carbon capture unit. Biomass power plant that uses firing technology can reduce CO2 emission by 148% compared to typical coal power plant. Installing carbon capture unit in biomass firing power plants can further reduce the specific CO2 emission by 262%. If carbon capture technology is implemented to all existing biomass power plants in Indonesia, it could reduce the greenhouse gas emission up to 2.2 million tonnes CO2 equivalent annually. It is found that there are 3 significant designs for gasification technology: NREL design, Rhodes & Keith design and IGBCC+DeCO2 design. The first two designs are not suitable to be retrofitted into existing biomass power plants in Indonesia since they are based on a specific BCL/FERCO gasifier. While IGBCC+DeCO2 design still needs further study regarding its feasibility. While for firing, the most promising technology to be applied in the near future is solvent-based absorption because it is already on commercial scale for coal-based power plants and can be implemented for other source, e.g. biomass power plant. Bio-CCS in existing biomass power plant with firing technology is likely to be implemented in the near future compared to the gasification, because it applies the post combustion capture as an \u201cend-of-pipe\u201d technology which is generally seen as a more viable option to be retrofitted to existing power plants, resulting in potentially less expensive transition.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "1748536fec18777ca3f7bd94ed5214d17034683a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2267450586", "CorpusId": 138037141}, "title": "\uc774\uc0b0\ud654\ud0c4\uc18c \ud3ec\uc9d1 \uc800\uc7a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uac1c\ub7c9 \ucf58\ud06c\ub9ac\ud2b8 \uac1c\ubc1c", "abstract": "Cement is considered one of the most important building materials around the world.

It is classified into three major types namely anthracite, bituminous, and lignite. Anthracite is the oldest coal from geological perspective. It is composed mainly of carbon with little volatile content and practically no moisture. Lignite is the youngest coal from geological perspective. It is a soft coal composed mainly of volatile matter and moisture content with low fixed carbon. Fixed carbon refers to carbon in its free state, not combined with other elements. Volatile matter refers to those combustible constituents of coal that vaporize when coal is heated. The common coals used in Indian industry are bituminous and sub-bituminous coal. Coal may contain natural fractures that enable some movement of gas. These fractures are caused by pressure from the overlying rock and the natural movements of the earth\u2019s crust. Stress loads in the reservoir determine the geometry of the fractures. The mechanisms for gas flow in the coal involves: a) desorption of the gas from the coal surface inside the micro pores; b) diffusion of the gas through the micro pores governed by Fick\u2019s law; Figure 4: Relationship Between Maturity Of Coal And Gas Generation; Hunt, J.M., (1979) and c) Darcy flow through the cleat system, natural fracture network in the coal to the wellbore. Gas is produced from coal with natural fractures. Recently, there has been a lot more development of CBM due to the use of techniques that create artificial fractures around well bores. This procedure is known as hydraulic fracturing. Horizontal wells are being used in different basins worldwide to increase the sweep area and sweep efficiency and also to connect maximum natural fractures. Based on the fracture and cleat orientation vertical and horizontal wells are drilled and hydro fracturing is done. Horizontal wells are drilled down vertically to the coal formation perpendicular to the most common fracture orientation, which allows it to intersect a much greater number of fractures. Natural gas production from gas rich coal formations are known as coal bed methane. The gas generated during coalification process and stored in coal seams in the adsorbed state on the internal surfaces of coal matrix. It forms in two ways i.e. i) during the early stage of coalification when plant detritus turns into coal, ii) as a by-product of bacterial respiration which is biogenic gas. The generation volume of methane is related to volatile matter as well as rank. Gas generation capability of coal is controlled by numerous factors: Optimum depth, thickness of the prospective coal seam, gas content, thermal maturity, coal chemistry permeability saturation and reservoir pressure. Methane is normally adsorbed in the internal surface of the coal and cannot be easily detected by conventional gas-well drilling technology. Network of naturally occurring micro fractures i.e. cleats which provide the important parameter for flow mechanism in coal. In coal bed methane (CBM) prospect, it is very important to study the cleats as the key of estimating production potential lies in presence of cleat networks or fractures in coal seam (K.K. Roy, 2006) Face cleats and butt cleats (fig 5) are the primary conduits for CBM which are well developed in vitrinite rich coal. Rift related Gondwana basins show a network of faults to induce better permeability. Free from major compressional folding. Sometimes artesian conditions associated with coal beds indicate better permeability for CBM production. Coal seams show vitrinite reflectance of 0.7 to 1.69%, rank suitable for thermogenic methane generation.

The concept of integrated development of both CBM and Underground coal gasification (UCG) is new (A. N.Thakre, 2007) and it requires exhaustive investigation of all parameters mainly geology, depth, technology etc. Horizontal CBM well completion provides pathways for propagation of burning zone of UCG front. Hydro-factures in CBM well creates conduit for UCG front (Fig 8). UCG technologies can be developed by utilizing abandoned coal mines drilling into the gallery, which acts as the production The International Journal Of Science & Technoledge (ISSN 2321 \u2013 919X) www.theijst.com 16 Vol 1 Issue 5 November, 2013 and injection wells (Burton et al., 2007). UCG gasification along a coal seam leaves highly porous cavities and stressed strata in its wake. As these areas cool down, the abandoned cavities can be accessed by directional drilling or through the existing production boreholes. CO2 would then be injected at high pressure for storage and retention. Unconventional coal fuels development is a technologically driven process. Currently, the drilling and completion of shale gas wells includes both vertical and horizontal wells and the processes of both shale gas exploration and that of coal exploration are almost same. Carbon sequestration in coal has been studied as a means of removing carbon dioxide, produced by human industrialization, from the atmosphere. CO2 can be separated from flue gases of power plant and injected into coal bed to replace CH4. CO2/ CH4 adsorption varies depending on the rank of coal. This process requires systematic studies of coal properties, delineation of coal seams. 4.Other Coal Fuels Coal mine methane is one of the coal fues i.e. all methane release during , after mining and methane capture prior to mining can be captured as coal mine methane which helps in degasification to control methane emission prior to and during drilling. Depending on the gassiness of coal seam and the fractured strata, horizontal /vertical or gob (goaf) vent wells can be used for CMM drainage. Fault, paleo channel, clay veins, changes in permeability facies, coal rank etc are controlling factors of gas emission into working mine. Gas capture and use in coal mines is not new. The first recorded methane drainage occurred in the United Kingdom in 1730. More modern, controlled methane drainage systems were introduced in Europe in the first half of the twentieth century. Utilisation of mine gas for lighting was studied the 18th century and was recorded in the 1880s.By the 1950s, systematic and effective gas capture methods that were originally developed in Germany and which were being used throughout Europe. Since the 1960s, increasing use has been made of drained gas, initially for mine boilers and industrial processes and then later for power generation, pipeline gas. On the other hand Coal-to-liquids (CTL) is a process which generates synthetic liquid fuels i.e. Gasoline and diesel fuel from coal. However the huge amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted during the CTL process, the emissions can be reduced by carbon capturing and sequestration (CCS) technology in which CO2 is sequestered in a geological formation. 5.Discussion Coal rank is arguably the most important factor influencing methane generation in coal beds.

That the world population determines global CO2 emission is an ecological rule of nature, and human activities cause the accumulation of carbon element on earth surface.

Target 11 specifically identifies the need to expand the number and area of protected areas to at least 17% of terrestrial and inland water habitats (from 12.7%) and 10% of marine areas (from c. 1%). A further 17 of the 20 targets are also related directly to the expansion and improved management of protected areas. Protected areas are the cornerstones of biodiversity conservation but generating support for more conservation areas will require stronger social and economic arguments to engender the political support to move fine words to effective action. The main environmental issues in the coming decades will be climate change, water stress, food security, energy production and biodiversity loss. There is strong evidence that protected area systems can be effective tools for meeting these challenges by optimizing natural solutions in climate change response strategies. This potential will only be realized, however, if individual protected areas are well-managed and protected area systems are planned to maximize their role in protecting both biodiversity and ecosystem services. Protected areas contribute to both mitigation and adaptation strategies by addressing the causes of climate change and helping societies to respond, and adapt, to the changes that are occurring. Mitigation includes both storage\u2014 preventing the loss of carbon already present in vegetation and soils\u2014and capture of carbon by sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere in natural ecosystems. Protected areas contribute to adaptation by protecting ecosystem resilience, buffering local climate and reducing risks and impacts from extreme events such as storms, floods, droughts and sea-level rise, and by providing and maintaining essential ecosystem services such as water supplies, fish stocks and other wild foods, and agricultural productivity (Dudley et al., 2009; World Bank, 2010). Protected areas globally are estimated to contain at least 15% of the terrestrial carbon stock. Forests cover c. 30% of the world\u2019s land area but store 50% of terrestrial carbon, including soil carbon. Forest cover is often strikingly higher in protected areas, especially in indigenous reserves, than in surrounding lands (Dudley et al., 2009). Inland wetlands, particularly peat, contain large carbon stores, as do grasslands, which are estimated to hold 10\u201330% of global soil carbon. With poor management, however, these habitats can easily become net sources of carbon; habitat loss and degradation are already responsible for c. 20% of annual carbon emissions. Coastal and marine habitats, especially salt marshes, mangroves, kelp and sea grass beds are also important carbon sinks, sequestering carbon more efficiently than terrestrial ecosystems of equivalent area (Laffoley & Grimsditch, 2009). Adaptation will become an increasingly important part of the development agenda (World Bank, 2010). Protected areas provide a practical contribution to climate change responses by safeguarding vital ecosystem services. Many protected areas are already legally designated, managed to maintain vegetation and biodiversity values, with recognized boundaries and dedicated staff. The ecosystem goods and services they provide will help to reduce vulnerability to climate change. Consider water, one of the most basic human needs. Some natural forests (particularly tropical montane cloud forests and some older forests) increase total water flow. Even more important, forests, wetlands and habitats such as the paramos of Latin America help to maintain water quality. Around one-third (33 out of 105) of the world\u2019s largest cities, including Jakarta, Mumbai, New York, Sofia, Bogot\u00e1, Dar es Salaam, Melbourne and Sydney, receive a significant proportion of their drinking water supplies directly from protected forest areas. As climatic events become more severe, natural habitats can help to reduce the impact of natural hazards and disasters. Protected, well-managed ecosystems, including forests and wetlands, can buffer many flood and tidal events, landslides and storms. Intact mangroves protect vulnerable coastal communities and reduce the damage caused by tsunamis and hurricanes. Integrating protection of natural riverine forests into flood management strategies has, for example, proven to be a cost-effective way to complement early-warning systems and infrastructure along the Parana River in Argentina, protecting rich biodiversity in the floodplains and human settlements (World Bank, 2010). Protected areas also contribute to long-term food security, providing downstream water supplies for agricultural fields and acting as natural reservoirs for wild crop relatives, medicinal plants, pollinators and pest control. Guanacaste National Park in Costa Rica, for example, benefits neighbouring citrus plantations through ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control and nutrient and water supply, KATHY MACKINNON (Corresponding author) and NIGEL DUDLEY World Commission on Protected Areas, IUCN, Rue Mauverney 28, 1196, Gland, Switzerland.

In the cement production process, CO2 is mainly released from the raw meal calcination and the fossil fuel combustion.The aim for reduction of specific CO2 emissions can be realized by application of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies. Thereby, Calcium Carbonate Looping (CaL) is a promising and competitive CCS technology for capturing CO2 from flue gases. The CaL technology uses CaO to absorb CO2 from flue gases in a first reactor (carbonator) with an exothermic carbonation reaction, where CaCO3 is formed. The CaCO3 is transferred to a second reactor (calciner), where the CO2 is released from the sorbent in an endothermic calcination reaction. The process is realized in an interconnected dual fluidized bed system. Comparing the CaL technology to other CCS technologies applicable to the cement industry, various synergies between the cement production process and the CaL technology are apparent. Solid management of CaO-bearing material is very similar in both processes. The future perspective using purge CaL material for cement production is promising as the purge material is chemically compatible as cement production material.The present paper summarizes the demonstration of the CaL process in an industrially relevant environment. Long-term operation in a semi-industrial scale 1 MWth pilot plant was successfully carried out setting the basis for industrial application of the technology.The data from pilot testing were used to validate CaL process models.

Therefore, real-time and effective CO2 monitoring is essential to improve efficiency, reduce pipeline emissions, and improve the economics of the natural gas industry. In this paper, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a distributed CO2 sensor based on the measurement of evanescent wave absorption by using optical frequency domain reflectometry (OFDR). A coreless fiber is re-coated with tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) through a dip-coating process with well-defined fabrication conditions.

These need to be quantified before large-scale implementation of any CDR option by means of life cycle assessment (LCA). Direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS) is considered to be among the CDR technologies closest to large-scale implementation, since first pilot and demonstration units have been installed and interactions with the environment are less complex than for biomass related CDR options.

The experience gained in the wind farms of California is being used to design and develop advanced systems with improved performance, higher reliability, and lower costs. During the past several years, substantial gains have been made in wind turbine designs, lowering costs to an average of $0.05 per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for utility-scale applications at 13 mile-per-hour (mph) average annual wind speeds. Further technology qevelopment is expected to allow the cost of wind-generated electricity to drop below $0.04 per kilowatt-hour by 2000. As a result, wind is expected to be one of the least expensive forms of new electric generation in the next century. With global efforts already underway to curb energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide, the current availability of this low-cost technology means that the use of wind systems will likely increase worldwide throughout the 1990s for both utility-scale applications and remote, small-village applications. This paper will present the technology developments for both utility-scale wind turbines and remote, small-village wind turbines that are currently available or in development. The authors describe future technology improvements and likely wind turbine configurations in 2000. Technology innovations are being adapted for remote and stand-alone power applications with smaller wind turbines. Hybrid power systems using smaller 1to 50-kilowatt (kW) wind turbines are being developed for non-grid-connected electrical generation applications. These village power systems typically use wind energy, photovoltaics (PV), battery storage, and conventional diesel generators to supply power for remote small-village communities. In remote locations, transportation costs can make fuel-powered generating systems extremely expensive. Smaller wind turbines are also being explored for application as distributed generation sources on utility grids to supply power during periods of peak demand, avoiding costly upgrades in distribution equipment. New turbine designs now account for turbulence-induced loads, unsteady aerodynamic stall effects, and complex fatigue loads, making use of new technology developments such as advanced airfoils tailored for wind turbine applications. These new airfoils increase the energy capture and improve the operating efficiency of turbine rotors by increasing the power for a given rotor thrust, and reducing the sensitivity of the airfoils to roughness which naturally accumulates during operation. Technology has been developed which uses power electronics to allow variable rotor speed operation to improve efficiency. Aerodynamic control devices, such as ailerons and flaps, are being explored to aerodynamically modulate power or stop the rotor in high-speed conditions. These technology trends and future turbine configurations are being explored through research and development activities sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) Wind Energy Program. Utility-Scale Systems In the United States, utility-scale wind turbines are the primary focus of new technology development. By 1996, U.S. manufacturers will have introduced seven new turbines (with capacities ranging from 250 to 500 kW) for the utility market. Five of the turbines are being developed by members of the U.S. wind industry with direct funding support from DOE. Cannon Energy Corporation and Kenetech Windpower are each developing a utility-scale wind turbine independently. Two of the utility-scale wind turbines sponsored by DOE are commercially available: R. Lynette & Associates' A WT -26, and Zond Systems' Z-40. Northern Power Systems, New World Grid Power, and Flowind Corporation are expected to introduce their turbine designs within the next two years. R. Lynette & Associates' AWT-26 The 275-kW AWT-26 (Figure 1) is a downwind, stall-regulated, free-yaw machine incorporating an innovative two-bladed teetered rotor. The A WT -26 is bas(id upon the ESI-80, a turbine developed in the United States during the mid1980s which had many promising features, but never reached commercial maturity. The designers of the A WT -26 have taken advantage of the substantial operating history of its predecessor, retained components that were reliable, and improved the remainder. The larger 26-meter (m) rotor incorporates aerodynamically efficient, wood-composite blades using National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) designed airfoils. The new blades improve the turbine's energy capture from 20% to 70%, depending on wind speed and the degree of blade soiling from dirt and insects. The A WT-26 also features a redesigned high-speed shaft brake and new aerodynamic tip vanes. The tip vanes serve two important functions on this turbine: as a fail-safe (emergency) brake and as an active brake for normal shut-down operations. Mounted on a hinge at the tip of each blade, the vanes are held closed by electromagnets. The vanes are activated by control system command, which releases the electromagnets. A redundant caliper disk brake can also stop the machine under normal or emergency conditions. The A WT -26 has been selected for a commercial 25-megawatt (MW) power plant to be installed in late 1995 in Washington state by a consortium of public utilities called CARES (Conservation and Renewable Energy Systems) as a project under the Bonneville Power Administration's Resource Supply Expansion Program (RSEP). The RSEP program was a competitive solicitation to add wind generation capacity to the Bonneville network. Northern Power Systems' North Wind 250 The 250-kW North Wind 250 (Figure 2) is a two\u00ad bladed, teetered, upwind machine that has been scaled up from the company's North Wind 100 Figure 1. R. Lynette & Associates' 275-kW AWT-26. Figure 2. Northern Power Systems' 250-kW North Wind 250. turbine. The new turbine features an integrated drive train, aileron controls, and an innovative rotor that is fabricated as a single unit. The \"flow-through\" rotor eliminates the blade root joints, which are expensive, complicated, and subject to high stress during turbine operation. The unique, flow\u00ad through, teetered-rotor design eliminates structural discontinuities at the blade/hub interface by fabricating the rotor as one continuous structural element. Fatigue tests were conducted on the full\u00ad scale rotor joint at NREL to qualify this element of the rotor for field testing and to provide information needed to improve its structural design. The hub incorporates teeter dampers and an active teeter brake. The rotor is made of a hybrid composite material. The hub saddle captures the blade center section in a wrap-around elastomeric blanket. The new rotor also substitutes aileron control for the full-span pitch control system used in the earlier North Wind model. Ailerons, which work like flaps on an airplane wing, are the most important development featured in the North Wind 250. When deflected in the downwind direction, they reduce lift and power output. When power modulation is needed, the ailerons can be deflected through small angles to either increase or decrease power. Upwind deflections increase lift, causing the power to increase. Wind tunnel tests at Wichita State University have confirmed the ability of ailerons to control power and prevent the rotor from over-speeding.", "year": 1994}]}
