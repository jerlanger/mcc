In order to do so, the paper firstly describes the climate threats for Europe as well as the birth and objectives of the EU climate and energy package adopted in 2009. Then, the different components of this package are highlighted: the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the obligations of the non-ETS sectors, the 20% renewable energy objective, the promotion of carbon capture and storage and the framework on environmental subsidies. Thirdly, the other EU climate policy legislations are examined, comprising: energy efficiency, the GHG emissions of cars, the GHG emissions of fuels, and the Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET-Plan). Next, adaptation to climate change is discussed, before examining the international aspects of the EU actions after Copenhagen. As a way of conclusion, the paper assesses the EU climate policy throughout four main questions: What has the EU achieved until now? What will be the costs? What will be the impact on the European Union?

The smart grid technologies mainly consist of renewable energy generation, carbon capture and storage (CCS), demand response and electric vehicles in this research. The approach uses robust optimization to determine the generation technology options in the context of smart grids under uncertainties. Robust optimization approach focuses on the consideration of parameter uncertainty in a mathematical programming problem. This paper explores the technical and economic feasibility of improving the utilization of smart grid technologies in the generation plan model. Since smart grid technologies have more uncertainties than conventional technologies, more estimation errors will appear and influence the optimal value of the generation planning problem. Therefore, the application of a robust optimization approach is proposed. In the adopted robust methodology, the optimal decision-making will search for the trade-off between the robustness and the optimality. The new model specifically considers the availability of smart grid technologies improving the performance of the generation system. In the proposed model, the objectives of the proposed model include investment, operational and maintenance cost, generation cost, reliability cost and carbon emission cost. Moreover, the constraints of both the electricity grid and the customer sector are considered in the generation planning. Due to the existing data uncertainties in the constraints, the robust linear programming problem is solved to find the corresponding robust counterpart, which means the uncertainty optimization problem will be transformed into a deterministic optimization problem. The derived robust counterpart model shows the multi-objective and multi-period generation expansion plan problem, and it will be solved by linear programming technique. The proposed optimization model is justified and described in some detail, apply it to the reference cases, to support the generation planning with smart grid technology applications.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "0f0fde7bba13b8290678879d09b01ac2e6e83cea", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2409624727", "CorpusId": 99607613}, "title": "PHOTOCATALYTIC REDUCTION OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN CONJUNCTION WITH DECOMPOSITION OF WATER ON OXIDE SEMICONDUCTOR SURFACES (complete version)", "abstract": "ABSTRACT \n \nKEY WORDS: Photocatalysis, CO2 reduction, TiO2, water splitting, layered perovskite,band gap. \n \nCarbon dioxide accounts for the largest share of the world\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions. There is a growing need to mitigate CO2 emissions. Some of the strategies to mitigate CO2 emissions are energy conservation, carbon capture and storage and using CO2 as a raw material in chemical processes. Reactions involving CO2 typically require energy input and/or a high energy substrate. The energy source should be provided without producing more CO2, such as solar energy. One of the best routes to remedy CO2 is to transform it to hydrocarbons via photo reduction. There by, solar energy is transformed and stored as chemical energy. The most ideal and desirable process would then be the simultaneous reduction of CO2 and water to yield hydrocarbons, which essentially works out to artificial photosynthesis. \nAmong various semiconductors, TiO2 is widely used in many photoinduced processes because of its comparatively low cost, low toxicity and its ability to resist photocorrosion. The effect of transition metal ion on TiO2 was studied for CO2 photoreduction. Addition of noble metal to TiO2 can change the distribution of electrons and they prevent the electron hole recombination, thereby enhancing the Photocatalytic efficiency of TiO2.Also the effect of coupling TiO2 with other metal oxide semiconductors ( CuO,NiO) for CO2 photoreduction was studied. \nWide band gap semiconductor materials are the most suitable for CO2 photoreduction. Since water is used as the reductant, the catalyst should be capable of splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen. NiO/La:NaTaO3 showed high activity for water splitting and quantum efficiency of 56% was observed for this catalyst. Hence NiO/La:NaTaO3 was tested for CO2 photoreduction with water. Layered pervoskite such as Sr3Ti2O7 and NiO/Ba:La2Ti2O7 which was active towards water splitting were also tested for CO2 photoreduction.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "2def12c81839e1d9665ead3f7147fa122b6a291e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3090913660", "DOI": "10.3390/su12198193", "CorpusId": 225145635}, "title": "Vertical Farming as a Game Changer for BECCS Technology Deployment", "abstract": "The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report that to limit warming to 1.5 \u00b0C, Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is required.

The authors pose the question of whether vertical farming (VF) technology can enable BECCS deployment, either via land sparing or supply. VF involves indoor controlled environment cultivation, and can increase productivity per unit land area by 5\u201310 times. VF is predominantly being used to grow small, high value leafy greens with rapid growth cycles. Capital expenditure, operational expenditure, and sustainability are challenges in current VF industries, and will affect the ability to utilise this technology for other crops. The authors argue that, whilst challenging, VF could help reach wider climate goals. Application of VF for bioenergy crops could be a game changer in delivering BECCS technologies and may reduce the land footprint required as well as the subsequent associated negative environmental impacts.

In this study, limestone samples were tested to investigate changes in their physical and mechanical characteristics once flooded by CO2 at a very low injection rate. The results obtained indicate that an excessive pressure drop might be experienced even under a very low injection rate because of continuous dissolution of carbonates in the presence of CO2 and brine. Creation of wormholes and the dissolution of the matrix were also observed through scanning electron microscope, computerized tomography scan, and nuclear magnetic resonance tests.

Carbon dioxide capture types: postcombustion, pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion. Most existing post-combustion technologies are based on chemical absorption using amines. Acidic gas removal using single alkanolamine and blended alkanolamine solutions have been used in various chemical industries, such as ammonia production and natural gas purification of the alkanolamine solutions, aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) solution has several advantages over the other alkanolamines. These advantages include low price and a high reaction rate with CO2. However, primary amines, such as monoethanolamine, directly react with CO2 to form carbamate and, thus, their regeneration requires high heat duty. Since chemical absorption forms strong bonds between absorbents and CO2, large amount of energy are required to break these bonds. On the other hand, in tertiary amines, such as triethanolamine (TEA) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), hydrogen atoms are not bound to nitrogen atoms and thus they cannot directly react with CO2. However, they do react in the form of bicarbonate . Therefore, it is known that tertiary amines require lower heat duties for regeneration comparable to primary and secondary amines.

The model considers two hydrogen production processes: (i) gas-to-gas (G2G) with carbon capture and storage (CCS), and (ii) power-to-gas (P2G).

With the rapid development of modern industry, agriculture and service, the ancient carbon balance has been broken. The carbon that was originally stored underneath the earth, represented by fossil energy and organic substances, has been released in large quantities, resulting in a series of ecological and environmental problems such as increased greenhouse gases, soil degradation, and declined quality of the cultivated land. All these factors contribute to the general tone of the global climate change, which possess impacts on the already fragile food security, energy resources, and the safety of environment and ecology. Re-introducing carbon and restoring it in the land is an important way to deal with the global climate change. Among many technologies for carbon capture and storage, biochar technology has received increased attention and high expectation. First, biochar can be used as a stable carbonrich product. After carbonizing biological materials and returning them to farmland, they can not only reduce carbon emissions, but also have a broad application prospects in improving the physical and chemical properties of soil, enhancing the quality of cultivated land, and increasing the crop yield. The large-scale industrial applications of biochar technology also provide important ways to achieve the use of alternative resource to reduce carbon emissions, which will lead to the mitigation of global climate change. Secondly, as a renewable energy source, the combustible gas produced during the production of biochar can partially replace fossil energy. Thirdly, as a biomass-based material, biochar can also be used for soil remediation, environmental improvement, and many other areas to be developed. The biochar technology is initiated from the modern understanding of ancient, consciously or unconsciously employed agricultural technologies and the trend of global climate change has enriched its content and resulted in a continuing increase in biochar-related research. However, there is still a big gap to reach the comprehensive and objective clarification of its mechanism, effectiveness, and carbon production technology. The relevant theoretical research, technology development, industrial economy and other related aspects are still in a preliminary stage, which presents an unopened area with great value. Therefore, all of these make us to have a beautiful vision for the future of biochar. Biochar, sponsored by Shenyang Agricultural University and published in cooperation with Springer Nature Group, mainly publishes innovative articles in the fields of biocharrelated preparation and processing, carbon-based materials, soil improvement, climate change, energy use, and rural and regional development. It is aimed to provide an innovative, efficient and professional platform for the researchers in the area of biochar around the world, to promote the healthy and rapid development of biochar, which is both an ancient and new technology.

Introduction: The accelerated transformation of land uses in the Colombian Andes has affected diversity and the provision of ecosystem services. Objective: The structure and floristic composition and the estimation of the carbon stored in biomass of intervened primary forests and pastures with trees in Santa Isabel, Tolima, was described. Methods: In each system, five sampling plots were established: rectangular of 1 000 m2 each in forests and circular of 707 m2 in pastures to measure all individuals with a diameter of 1.30 m in height, \u226510 cm. The biomass was estimated from multi-species allometric models and a generic model in the case of below-ground biomass. Results: In the forest, an average abundance of 642 \u00b1 125 individuals / ha was recorded, finding 25 families, 39 genera, 43 species and morphospecies in 0.5 ha of sampling. Quercus humboldtii and Ladenbergia macrocarpa were the species with the highest Importance Value Index (IVI = 32.5 and 11.2, respectively) in the forests. In pastures, 175.0 \u00b1 21.3 individuals / ha were found, belonging to 8 families, 9 genera, 10 species and morphospecies in 0.35 ha of sampling. Weinmannia pubescens and Eugenia spp. had the greatest ecological importance (19.5 and 17.6 %, respectively) in pastures. The forest stored an average of 125.0 \u00b1 30.0 t C/ ha, compared to 18.4 \u00b1 1.8 t C/ha in pastures. Conclusions: These findings show high carbon storage capacity in these land uses, which contributes to maintain or decrease the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and therefore, are a benchmark that allows to develop conservation strategies, with a view to mitigate climate change.

The purpose of the Baltic Storage of CO2 (\u2018Bastor 2\u2019) project is to increase awareness of the potential for geological storage of CO2 in the Baltic Sea and to identify barriers to CCS implementation. This report \u2013 the main outcome of work package 4 on legal and fiscal aspects of the Bastor 2 project \u2013 provides an analysis of the current and suggested legal framework that would regulate CCS activities in Sweden and the wider Baltic Sea region. The evolution of a well-functioning legal framework for regional CCS operations is expected to be time consuming for which reasonthe early identification of potential hurdles is critical to all stakeholders. Against this backdrop the report\u2019s core aim is to give an accessible account of the legal framework and how it is likely to affect various actors along the CCS value chain. This includes the identification of legal obstacles and gaps as well as analyzing the incentives and disincentives that are created by the law in its current form. Although taking Sweden as a starting point the report inevitably has its main focus on the EU CCS Directive (Directive 2009/31/EC) and related pieces of EU law. The report utilizes a decision tree structure to describe the key interlinked business processes which form the CCS value chain, thereby enabling the identification of ambiguities or gaps in the regulatory system and highlighting the multiple factors that determine the effect of decisions made along the chain. In addition to providing an increased understanding of the legal framework and its defining impact on the CCS value chain the report sets out a number of recommendations, primarily intended as input to the discussions regarding the imminent revision of the CCS Directive. Among these are that a clearer definition of \u2018captured CO2\u2019 ought to be developed and that more consideration should be given to potential market failures and the role of competition authorities in the buildup of CCS infrastructure. Particularly the rules on third party access to pipelines and storage sites are found to be quite vague at the EU level and thereby create room for problematic discrepancies between theMember States. In this regard the EU Natural Gas Directive could provide a valuable point of reference. The responsibility for any transboundary CCS installations or structures is also under-regulated thereby causing significant uncertainties that ought to be addressed e.g. by means of relevant guidelines. As to the potential for storing CO2 captured in the EU outside of the union, something which may be relevant in a regional Baltic context since parts of the Baltic Sea is under Russian jurisdiction, this is found to be impossible without significant amendments to applicable EU law. It is also concluded that further efforts should be made to enable transport of captured CO2 by ship, something which currently is highly problematic due to the details of the EU emissions trading system (EU ETS), and that the inclusion of biogenic emissions under the EU ETS may also benefit the deployment of CCS in the Baltic Sea region.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "e58002a45e64890b044cbbc44a00466d76fe9614", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2181892716", "CorpusId": 15567824}, "title": "Numerical simulation of CO 2 injection into deep saline aquifers", "abstract": "In the last two centuries, atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) have in- creased by about 35% as a result of anthropogenic emissions. To reduce these emissions, geologic Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) has been introduced as an emerging technology. Current estimations report that deep saline formations account for approximately 60% of the total subsur- face storage. Carbon geologic storage involves the injection of CO 2 in supercritical state into deep confined aquifers and can be modeled based upon the theory of two-phase flow in porous media. Supercritical CO 2 is less dense and less viscous than brine, which causes gravity override. The mass conservation equations for the two phases constitute a non-linear system of partial differential equations (PDE). In this work, MFLOW3D, a numerical finite-element model, is used to solve this non-linear system of PDE's and to test the simulation of CO 2 injection into a hypothetical and ideal confined aquifers. In MFLOW3D, the PDE's are discretized in space using linear three- dimensional finite elements in order to obtain a nonlinear system of ordinary differential equations. The temporal discretization is implemented via a finite difference backward-Euler scheme. The non-linearity is solved by using Newton-like iterative methods. Several scenarios are here simulat- ed in order to analyze the effect of different factors on the accuracy of MFLOW3D results.

This dynamic process has reflected the evolution of human civilization and industrialization. As one of the most useful and classical energy resources, what is the outlook for the coal industry in the future? What factors will have a great impact on the outlook? Can new technologies in coal production make the coal industry cleaner and more competitive and increase its demand in the world market? How effective are CO2 capture technologies for coal power plants? This editorial work attempts to provide insights into these issues. 1. The future outlook for the coal industry Limiting global warming to 2 \u25e6C versus pre-industrial levels would imply reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 80% of the 1990 level by 2050 and a net-zero emission by the end of this century. To make this happen requires a fast transition of traditional fossil fuels to renewable energy such as wind and solar. In this framework, coal demand is expected to decline by about 8% by 2030 compared to the pre-crisis level in 2019. Advanced economies will cut their demand by 45% compared to 2019. China is still the largest consumer and producer, and the coal usage in China is expected to rebound in the near term and achieve its peak around 2025 followed by a gradual decline after 2025. In the Asia Pacific area, India, Indonesia and Southeast Asian countries will increase their coal demand for power and industrial usage in the next decade (IEA, 2020). By 2030 the global coal demand is projected to decrease by about 400 million tonnes of coal equivalent compared to 2019. 2. The impact of major factors on the outlook Environmental concerns to reduce CO2 emissions from coal-fired plants, declining coal usage in the power sector due to renewables expansion and a cheap natural gas price, and policies that phase out coal to achieve carbon neutralities are the three major factors leading to the coal market downturn. The power sector accounts for nearly 65% of coal demand. By 2030, advanced economies will consume 50% less coal compared to their level in 2019 mainly due to policy-driven requirements. The increasing supply of renewables and natural gas has diversified the power generation sources, and significantly reduced the coal usage in this sector. Coal is the largest source of CO2 emissions and will be responsible for approximately 38% of the global CO2 emissions from 2020 to 2030. The policy-driven changes are significantly affecting coal usage worldwide (IEA, 2020; IMF, 2020). 3. Development of new technologies in the coal industry Potential technologies are emerging in the coal industry, such as hydraulic fracturing to improve the coalbed methane production; the CO2 capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS) to reduce CO2 emissions from coal combustion; the coal-to-liquid and coal-to-gas fuel conversion technologies to improve the fuel efficiency and reduce the CO2 emissions; internet of things, big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and automation to reduce operational costs and improve safety concerns and production efficiency in coal operations; and, underground coal gasification (UCG) to recover un-minable coal. Particularly, UCG has been attempted for over a century, and has not yet achieved a commercial-scale development. Successful development and utilization of this technology would make the coal industry more competitive and increase its demand in the world market. A UCG operation consists of a series of injection and production wells drilled into a coal seam; the coal is ignited after certain air and/or oxygen is injected. Chemical reactions convert the coal to syngas by pyrolysis, combustion and gasification reactions in a manner similar to those processes in a surface gasifier. The produced syngas is a mixture of mainly carbon monoxide and hydrogen, which can be used as fuel for power generation and feedstock for various chemical products (i.e., hydrogen and ammonia) (Nourozieh et al., 2010; Seifi et al., 2015). The carbon captured during syngas utilization can be used for enhanced oil recovery. Emissions from syngas combustion are generally cleaner and less greenhouse gas emissions than coal-fired facilities. The UCG process is less costly than conventional surficial coal gasification because no coal mining, processing and transport are required, and no ash and slag removal or disposal is necessary. The environmental impact of UCG is relatively low compared to surficial gasification, as major disturbances in landscape and surface disposal of ash and coal tailings are not required. A properly designed UCG site will recognize and address potential groundwater pollution and subsidence issues; tests related to the cap rock integrity and highly cemented wells should be performed to avoid these issues. UCG can have obvious advantages compared with other in situ coal applications, including mining, coalbed methane exploration and development; the cavities after UCG can be used as CO2 storage (Jiang et al., 2019). 4. CO2 capture technologies for coal power plants Five main types of CO2 capture technologies from flue gas are proven. The average capture efficiency is from 80% to 90%. Cryogenic separation can provide the highest capture efficiency up to 99.99%. The CO2 capture step represents 70-80% of the overall CO2 capture and sequestration costs. Economic analysis shows that US $70-100 are needed to capture one tonne CO2 from flue gas (the average CO2 concentration is about 3-14%) on average. On the other hand, it costs between US $300 to $1,500 to capture CO2 directly from air (Brandl et al., 2021). It would be possible to commercialize the capture efficiency beyond 90%. However, operators are not able to make benefits under the current policies because of the high associated\u00a0 capital and operational costs. The capture approaches include post-combustion, pre-combustion, oxyfuel combustion, chemical looping combustion and from air. The post-combustion technology is a mature technology, and has been widely applied. Future CO2 capture technologies are likely to focus on hybrid capture technologies, such as integrated CO2 capture and conversion. The coal use in the power sector surpassed 10 Gt CO2 emissions globally in 2018, and a successful application of carbon capture technologies can help the world reduce up to 8-10 Gt CO2 emissions annually. CCUS has received much research attention over the past two decades. Cited as : Ma, H., Chen, S., Xue, D., Chen, Y., Chen, Z. Outlook for the coal industry and new coal production technologies.

Cost-effective transportation of CO2 from point sources to utilization and storage sites is a significant bottleneck for at-scale carbon management. A new mechanism to achieve international cooperation on carbon management through effective CO2-source and CO2-use or sequestration matching is addressed in this paper. The mechanism is founded on utilizing the growth of global LNG trade to transport CO2 over long distances via dual-use vessels that carry CO2 on their return journey following LNG delivery. A foundational carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)-based economic model for the utilization of CO2 originating in South Korea and Japan via enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in the offshore U.S. is explored.

This construal of harm also productively intersects other colonial strategies of harm reduction relative to the tar sands, including the criminalisation of Indigenous jurisdiction, and is part of a broader relational context that prioritises settler colonial futurity.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "d11868c669b3fe6b41f76741655a86be5c4fea6c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "245428400", "CorpusId": 107690543}, "title": "Benefits of Integrated Upgrading of Biofuels in Biorefineries - Systems Analysis", "abstract": "As a result of increasing concerns about climate change, there is considerable current interest in increasing use of CO 2 -neutral biofuel in the energy system. Increased use of biomass fuel requires that it be upgraded in order to facilitate transportation and distribution to end-users. Advanced level upgrading is necessary if biomass is to be used as a transportation fuel. Biomass upgrading requires energy, and the conversion efficiency can be maximized if achieved in energy-efficient biorefinery processes. \nThe main objective of this thesis is to analyze biorefinery concepts with respect to energy efficiency, profitability and CO 2 emissions. Special attention is paid to integrated biorefinery concepts in which a biofuel upgrading production process is integrated with another process enabling exchange of useful energy or material streams. The thesis aims at quantifying the extent to which such integrated concepts are more profitable, energy efficient and CO 2 -lean than stand-alone production units. \nThe biorefinery processes evaluated are pellet production and hydrogen production from gasified black liquor integrated with a pulp mill, and hydrogen production from gasified biomass integrated with a natural gas combined cycle heat and power plant. These processes are evaluated using different possible future energy market scenarios. \nPellet production integrated with a pulp mill is shown to be beneficial from a CO 2 perspective. The economic benefits depend on the biomass dryer technology used for integrated pellet production, which tend to be more costly compared to the Stand-alone pellet production. However, integrated pellet production benefits from surplus material, common personnel and infrastructure available at the site. \nIf gasified, black liquor can be used for increased electricity production or for synthesis of e.g. methanol and hydrogen. Hydrogen production from gasified black liquor has the greatest potential for net CO 2 reduction in four of five future energy market scenarios used for the evaluation. This indicates that for many possible future scenarios, hydrogen production from gasified black liquor will be an efficient way to use biofuel. Hydrogen production enables pre-combustion carbon capture and storage and this contributes to profitability and CO 2 emissions reduction. \nA final conclusion is that it is important to adopt a systems perspective when performing studies to identify the most effective ways to use limited biomass for resources when developing sustainable energy system solutions for the future.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "e57bab1a386f68d5b36d695bf0e805902cc86a0f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2132374627", "CorpusId": 73546690}, "title": "Diverting CO2 Emissions from the Atmosphere through Capture and Geologic Sequestration: The Journey So Far!", "abstract": "Carbon Dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions accumulating in the earth\u2019s atmosphere as a result of the use of fossil fuels for energy generation are causing an\u00a0 imbalance in the Earth\u2019s incoming and outgoing radiation.

A range of thermodynamic conditions was explored, including temperatures ranging from subcritical to supercritical, and various densities. Preferential adsorption of carbon dioxide near the \u2212OH groups on the surface was observed, where the adsorbed CO2 molecules tend to interact simultaneously with more than one \u2212OH group. Analysis of the simulation results suggests that the preferential CO2 adsorption to the pore walls weakens the adsorption of n-butane, lowers the activation energy for n-butane diffusivity, and consequently enhances n-butane mobility. The diffusion results obtained for pure CO2 are consistent with strong adsorption on the pore walls, as the CO2 self-diffusion coefficient is low at low densities, increases with loading, and exhibits a maximum as the density is increased further because of hindrance effects. As the temperature increases, the maximum in self-diffusion coefficient is narrower, steeper, and shifted to lower loading. The simulation results are also quantified in terms of molecular density profiles for both butane and CO2 and in terms of residence time of the various molecules near the solid substrate. Our results could be useful for designing separation devices and also for better understanding the behavior of fluids in subsurface environments. \u25a0 INTRODUCTION International attention on curbing anthropogenic CO2 emissions has recently increased dramatically. Among other technologies, CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is considered one of the most attractive alternatives. Some pilot CCS projects have been initiated. In Sleipner (west Norway), 1 million metric tons of CO2 have been injected annually, since 1996, into sedimentary basins. Recently, CO2 has been injected into basaltic formations, because their high content of Ca, Mg, and Fe suggests the possibility of achieving CO2 mineralization. 6\u22128 CO2 sequestration combined with enhanced coal bed methane recovery has been extensively studied, and CO2 injection is often used in tertiary enhanced oil recovery in depleted petroleum reservoirs. Lately, CO2 has also been used in fracturing fluids for shale gas stimulation. Not only CO2 can be captured and stored within the shale formation, recent results suggest that in some cases CO2 can create better fractured networks compared to water. Should CO2 exhibit higher affinity to the rock formations than hydrocarbons, it could help increase production. Understanding the relation between competitive adsorption and transport of CO2 and hydrocarbons in rock formations is considered crucial to optimize both CO2 storage capacity and natural gas production. Much is known about structure and dynamics of carbon dioxide and methane confined in activated carbons, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and zeolites. The transport of CO2 through silica has been studied using experiments and simulations. Experimental and simulation results confirm the preferential adsorption of CO2 from binary CO2/CH4 mixtures. High CO2 adsorption selectivity was observed in CNTs. An extensive review on CO2 and methane storage in hybrid porous solids, crystallized porous materials including MOFs, and porous coordination polymers was compiled by Ferey et al., who summarized structural, spectroscopic, thermodynamics experiments as well as molecular simulation results. Because of the intrinsic limitations of experiments, thermodynamic models, and simulations, holistic approaches inclusive of all such contributions are needed to completely understand complex phenomena such as those just discussed. As opposed to the extensive literature on pure CO2 and CH4 and on their binary mixtures, few results are available for mixtures of CO2 and higher molecular weight hydrocarbons such as butane and octane in microporous confinement.

The single most significant driver of climate change is the increase in the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere from the combustion of fossil fuels. Efforts to limit the impacts of climate change focus on reducing the emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases and adapting to live with the changing climate. In recent years, a third approach has gained significant attention: action to remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store the CO2 for long timescales (over hundreds of years). Recent negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) delivered the 2015 Paris Agreement, which set a target of limiting global average temperature rise to \u2018well below 2 \u00b0C\u2019 (the 2 \u00b0C target having been agreed within the UNFCCC in 2010) while \u2018pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C\u2019 (UNFCCC, 2015). These are ambitious goals that will require immediate and radical emissions reductions if they are to be met. The idea of introducing \u2018negative emissions\u2019 is born out of the gap between the current trajectory in global emissions and the pathway necessary to avoid dangerous climate change. The most prominent proposal for achieving such negative emissions is to use biomass as a feedstock to generate electricity (or produce biofuels or hydrogen), capture the CO2 during production and store it underground in geological reservoirs \u2013 biomass energy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS for short. However, the negative emissions concept remains just that, a concept; in principle, technologies such as BECCS can deliver net CO2 removal at a project scale, or potentially at a global scale sufficient to impact atmospheric concentrations of CO2 and associated global average temperatures \u2013 but in practice, this potential has yet to be accessed at anything like a global scale. This book explores the challenges of unlocking negative emissions using BECCS. Future climate change is most commonly explored using a suite of models that represent the Earth\u2019s climate system, the physical and socio\u2010economic impacts of a changing climate and the greenhouse gases and other drivers generated by the global Understanding Negative Emissions From BECCS Clair Gough, Sarah Mander, Patricia Thornley, Amanda Lea\u2010Langton and Naomi Vaughan", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "a9298720a34c98ffc4e3f77a9f071a02e4133d63", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3125215254", "DOI": "10.1039/D0QI01393E", "CorpusId": 234215665}, "title": "Dipolar and catalytic effects of an Fe3O4 based nitrogen-doped hollow carbon sphere framework for high performance lithium sulfur batteries", "abstract": "Lithium\u2013sulfur (Li\u2013S) batteries have shown great potential as next generation energy storage systems. However, the practical application is limited by the low electronic/ionic conductivity of sulfur, polysulfide dissolution and sluggish conversion. To solve the above-mentioned problems, a well-designed hollow carbon sphere framework with embedded Fe3O4 nanoparticles (S/Fe3O4-NC) is reported here as an efficient sulfur host for Li\u2013S batteries. In consequence, S/Fe3O4-NC exhibited a high initial discharge capacity of 1264 mA h g\u22121 at 0.1 A g\u22121, a decent rate performance of 654 mA h g\u22121 at 2 A g\u22121 and a cycling stability of 61.1% capacity retention after 500 cycles, which are much better than those of a bowl-like hemisphere carbon structure without metal salt (S/NC). The decent performances are not only attributed to physical confinement that prevent polysulfide dissolving. Moreover, we prove that the embedded Fe3O4 nanoparticles can effectively function as polysulfide capture center due to the strong dipolar interactions, so that the polysulfide can largely be fixed and confined in the porous carbon layer. In addition, the high conductivity and catalytic activity of Fe3O4 can accelerate the redox conversion of polysulfide, thus facilitating the reaction kinetics. Benefiting from the structural and chemical optimization, a favorable performance was obtained with a capacity decay of each cycle being only 0.08% for over 500 cycles at 1 A g\u22121, showing great potential for practical applications.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "a3cda645b113e3e645a90cfa6d37ff408f69a3d6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2999174867", "DOI": "10.1109/EnCon.2019.8861255", "CorpusId": 210694671}, "title": "Optimization of Hybrid Renewable Energy in Sarawak Remote Rural Area Using HOMER Software", "abstract": "In past few years, there has been a huge concern about decentralized electricity supply in Sarawak, Malaysia.

The process is a post-combustion technology that cools CO2-laden flue gas to desublimation temperatures (\u2212100 to \u2212135 \u00b0C), separates solid CO2\u2014that forms from the flue gas\u2014from the light gases, uses the cold products to cool incoming gases in a recuperative heat exchanger, compresses the solid/liquid CO2 to final pressures (100\u2013200 bar), and delivers a compressed CO2 stream separated from an atmospheric pressure light-gas stream. The overall energy and economic costs are about 30-50% lower than most competing processes that involve air separation units (ASUs), solvents, or similar technologies. In addition, the CCC process enjoys several ancillary benefits, including (a) it is a minimally invasive Bolton technology, (b) it provides highly efficient removal of most pollutants (Hg, SOx, NO2, HCl, etc.), and (c) possible energy storage capacity. This report outlines the process details and economic and energy comparisons relative to other well-documented alternatives. \n \nThis paper presents the results of a detailed techno-economic comparison of CCC with amine-based systems. The comparison uses identical financial and economic assumptions similar process assumptions as the detailed analyses published by US DOE in the greenfield analysis. Specifically, the comparison assumes power plants that produce the same net output, one equipped with and a second without carbon capture. Separately, the paper compares similar analyses for retrofitting existing systems using typical plant characteristics in the US (initial capital costs have been paid, high plant utilization), though there are no DOE estimates available for direct comparison. Financial and technical assumptions for all comparisons are maintained as close to the DOE reference studies as possible. \n \nThe results demonstrate about 30-50% lower costs and energy demands for capture from greenfield coal plants. Natural gas plants produce substantially lower CO2 concentrations which makes the cost of capturing a ton of CO2 at the same capture rate as the coal plant higher for all processes while the cost of CO2 capture per unit of power generation is lower. However, CCC maintains about the same absolute energy and cost advantages for NG as for coal compared to amine systems. Finally, the costs of retrofitting a station are compared to those of building a new station with and without capture. The retrofit costs are comparable to (slightly lower than) new plant costs without capture. In all cases operating and capital cost comparisons show that the CCC process can be retrofitted to a variety of plants to cost effectively reduce CO2 emissions. Further process integration into the upstream processes and unique process features like water recovery, and integrated energy storage bring the effective cost of carbon capture using the CCC process down further and increase its advantages over alternatives. This technoeconomic analysis shows that the CCC process has the potential to the be lowest cost carbon capture technology under development today.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "d7c37472444741530ad9960d85ea9669176cffdb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "163119517", "DOI": "10.1007/978-90-481-2636-1_11", "CorpusId": 127874501}, "title": "Communicating scientific uncertainty for decision making about CO2 storage", "abstract": "As the severity of the global CO2 problem gradually is becoming clear to everybody, decisions will have to be made concerning permitting of carbon storage projects.

Technologies that rely on chemical absorption or physical adsorption have been developed to capture CO2 from industrial flue gases and sequester it at storage sites. Carbonic anhydrases (CAs), metalloenzymes, that catalyze the reversible hydration of CO2 have recently received attention as biocatalysts in the capture of CO2 from flue gases, but their cost presents a major obstacle for use at an industrial scale. This cost, however, can be reduced either by producing a long-lasting enzyme suitable for CO2 capture or by lowering production costs. High-level expression, easy purification, and immobilization of CAs from Sulfurihydrogenibium azorense (SazCA) were investigated in a plant system. Fusion of the 60-amino acid-long ectodomain (M-domain) of the human receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C increased the levels of SazCA accumulation. Fusion of the cellulose-binding module (CBM3) from Clostridium thermocellum resulted in tight binding of recombinant protein to microcrystalline cellulose beads, enabling easy purification. The chimeric fusion protein, BMC-SazCA, which consisted of SazCA with the M and CBM3 domains, was expressed in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana), giving a recombinant protein yield in leaf extracts of 350 mg/kg fresh weight. BMC-SazCA produced in planta was active in the presence of various chemicals used in CO2 capture. Immobilization of BMC-SazCA on the surface of microcrystalline cellulose beads extended its heat stability, allowing its reuse in multiple rounds of the CO2 hydration reaction.

Batch experiments were conducted in a specially designed CO2 glove box (95\u201399 vol.% CO2) at four different moisture contents (0, 15, 27.5 wt.%, and a suspension of soil to water ratio 1:10) and different reaction times up to 30 days. A control experiment was conducted at the ambient conditions open to the atmosphere otherwise the same conditions. Physicochemical properties of the soil samples (i.e., pH, mineralogy, organic matter (OM), inorganic carbon (IC), and cation exchange capacity (CEC)) as well as leachability of metal(loid)s were examined before and after the CO2 incubation. Results showed that the pH of the CO2-incubated partially wet (15 and 27.5 wt.%) and suspension samples rapidly decreased by about one unit (P\u2009<\u20090.01) in 2 h and gradually recovered in 10 days. It was noteworthy that CO2 was adsorbed to the dry soil (0 wt.%) and led to acidification as the soil pH dropped from 5.56\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 to 4.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03. Soil organic matter content and cation exchange capacity decreased with increasing moisture content in the CO2-incubated samples. A noticeable increase in the leachability of Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, Mn, K, and Zn were observed in the CO2-incubated soil suspensions. In contrast, the leachability of metal(loid)s in the dry and partially wet samples were not remarkable, although the soil pH decreased significantly. Our findings highlighted the effect of CO2 exposure on the soil acidification, even to soils in unsaturated zones, and stressed to monitor simultaneously soil physicochemical properties and metal(loid)s leaching induced by CO2 exposure in the near-surface environment.

This study investigated the haemolymph buffering capacity and energy metabolism (oxygen consumption, haemolymph [l-lactate] and [protein]) in early benthic juveniles (carapace length <40\u2005mm) of the European lobster, Homarus gammarus, exposed to elevated temperature and PCO2. At 13\u00b0C, H. gammarus juveniles were able to fully compensate for acid\u2013base disturbances caused by the exposure to elevated seawater PCO2 at levels associated with ocean acidification and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) leakage scenarios, via haemolymph [HCO3\u2212] regulation. However, metabolic rate remained constant and food consumption decreased under elevated PCO2, indicating reduced energy availability. Juveniles at 17\u00b0C showed no ability to actively compensate haemolymph pH, resulting in decreased haemolymph pH particularly under CCS conditions. Early benthic juvenile lobsters at 17\u00b0C were not able to increase energy intake to offset increased energy demand and therefore appear to be unable to respond to acid\u2013base disturbances due to increased PCO2 at elevated temperature. Analysis of haemolymph metabolites suggests that, even under control conditions, juveniles were energetically limited. They exhibited high haemolymph [l-lactate], indicating recourse to anaerobic metabolism. Low haemolymph [protein] was linked to minimal non-bicarbonate buffering and reduced oxygen transport capacity. We discuss these results in the context of potential impacts of ongoing ocean change and CCS leakage scenarios on the development of juvenile H. gammarus and future lobster populations and stocks.

CO2is one of chief green house gas. Rising the carbon dioxide levels continuously, warming atmosphere resulting from rising sea levels, agriculture disruptions, and stronger storms. To reduce the amount of Carbon dioxide in atmosphere Carbon Sequestration is needed. Carbon Sequestration is the process of capture and long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Storing the carbon dioxide in plants and soil (Terrestrial Sequestration), Underground (Geological Sequestration) and Deep in Ocean (Ocean Sequestration). Terrestrial or biologic sequestration is process of atmospheric carbon dioxide is stored as carbon in the stems and roots of plants and also in soil. Estimating the amount of forest biomass is very crucial for monitoring and estimating the amount of carbon that is lost or emitted during deforestation, and it will also give an idea of the forest potential to sequester and store carbon in the forest ecosystem. Estimations of forest carbon stocks are based upon the estimation of forest biomass. Whereas Geological and Ocean Sequestration are the storing the carbon dioxide in large tunnels.

The current state-of-the-art is briefly discussed, and strategies for the development of next-generation materials exhibiting enhanced performance are presented in the context of metal-organic frameworks. Furthermore, the benefit of high-throughput technologies in the synthesis and characterization of metal-organic frameworks is also highlighted as a potential means of accelerating the discovery of high-performance materials.In Chapter Two, the synthesis and hydrogen storage properties of Be12(OH)12(BTB)4, the first metal-organic framework based on the lightest divalent metal, Be 2+ , is described. The high surface area resulting from the use of lightweight Be 2+ cations leads to one of the highest gravimetric hydrogen storage densities observed at both cryogenic and ambient temperatures.Chapter Three introduces the use of a high-throughput methodology in the synthesis of an Fe 2+ -based, sodalite-type metal-organic framework, Fe3[(Fe4Cl)3(BTT)8]2 (Fe-BTT). This material features a high-density of exposed metal cation adsorption sites on the pore surface, which facilitates strong framework-H2 interactions that are close to the adsorption enthalpy considered optimal for hydrogen storage at ambient temperatures. The resulting hydrogen adsorption properties are discussed, as well as the effect of these adsorption sites on the carbon dioxide capture performance.The hydrogen storage properties of Mg2(dobdc), a lightweight metal-organic framework possessing Mg 2+ adsorption sites, are studied in Chapter Four using a combination of adsorption experiments, infrared spectroscopy, and powder neutron diffraction data. The high affinity of H2 toward the exposed metal cation sites results in a high enthalpy of adsorption, which is of importance in raising the storage density at ambient temperatures.Chapter Five describes the hydrogen storage properties of Cr3(BTC)2, a metal-organic framework featuring pores decorated with Cr 2+ adsorption sites. In contrast to Fe-BTT and Mg2(dobdc), the relatively diffuse nature of the Cr 2+ cations results in a low adsorption enthalpy at these sites, highlighting the importance of the identity of the metal ion in controlling the thermodynamics of adsorption.Chapter Six describes a new high-throughput methodology developed for the synthesis and adsorption screening of new metal-organic frameworks for carbon dioxide capture. The use of the workflow is discussed in the context of metal-insertion reactions within the material Al(OH)(bpydc), which features one-dimensional pores lined with 2,2'-bipyridine binding sites.

In Chapter Seven, a new method for geometrically calculating the wall separation distances from the single-crystal structure is described and employed in studying a variety of known structure types. In this case, the routine is used to analyze metal-organic frameworks for methane storage due to the abundance of high-pressure methane adsorption data in the literature, and it is demonstrated that the optimization of the wall separations is indeed crucial for maximizing the volumetric storage capacity in storage applications.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "24e6bb1bd2c1fa1f1ff0d5b1f0f70d6d59a8099d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2900074325", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.201802994", "CorpusId": 187752612}, "title": "Impact Of CO2-WAG Design Optimisation On Coupled CO2-EOR And Storage Projects In Carbonate Reservoirs", "abstract": "CO2-WAG injection has been applied in offshore Brazilian carbonate reservoirs aiming to improve oil recovery and promote a safe destination to CO2 naturally being produced alongside with hydrocarbon gas.

Brazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee beans with approx. a 30% market share. Depending on climate conditions, approx. 30 million bags of coffee beans are exported annually from Brazil, while domestic consumption is around 10 million bags, which makes Brazil the world's third largest coffee-consuming country. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to present the LCA of green coffee produced in Brazil for the reference crops 2001/02 and 2002/03 in order to generate detailed production inventory data as well as to identify the potential environmental impacts of its tillage in order to realize how to reduce those impacts and increase the environmental sustainability of this product. Only the inputs and outputs relative to the coffee tillage were considered. The production of fertilizers, correctives and pesticides were not included in the boundary, but only their amounts. The functional unit selected for this study was 1,000 kg of green coffee destined for exportation. Methods. The LCI was performed according to the ISO 14040 standard series. All information considered in this study (use of water, fossil based energy, fertilizers and chemicals) were taken up in in-depth data collection and evaluation by questionnaires applied on a farm level and/or received by mail. Four Brazilian coffee producer regions were evaluated: Cerrado Mineiro, South of Minas Gerais State, the Mar\u00edlia and Alta Mogiana regions in S\u00e3o Paulo State. These regions have the following geographic coordinates: 44 to 50\u00b0 W longitude and 18 to 24\u00b0 S latitude. The data refer to a production of 420,000 coffee bean bags and a productive area of approx. 14,300 ha. The varieties of coffee beans considered in this study were Mundo Novo, Catua\u00ed (yellow and red), Icatu (yellow and red), Catuca\u00ed (yellow and red) and Obat\u00e3. Farm specific data along with agricultural production data have been combined to elaborate a coffee cultivation inventory, which will be applied in an emissions estimation. Results and Conclusion. The production of 1,000 kg of green coffee in Brazil requires approx. 11,400 kg of water, 94 kg of diesel, 270 kg of fertilizers as NPK, 900 kg of total fertilizers, 620 kg of correctives, 10 kg of pesticides and 0.05 hectare of annual land use. Outputs related to these functional units are approx. 3,000 kg of waste water from coffee washing, 8,500 kg of waste water from the wet method and 750 kg of organic residue that is reincorporated to the tillage as fertilizer. The publication of an LCI of agricultural products is a fundamental step for understanding the potential environmental impacts of each tillage and then establishes the basis for product sustainability. In this way, this work is the first Brazilian initiative for applying LCA to coffee cultivation. Introduction The world coffee bean market is characterized by the presence of sixty coffee producing countries. Brazil and Colombia together command approximately half of the world market, while the remaining countries have small market shares. Brazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee beans in terms of cultivated area and bag production with approx. a 30% market share. Depending on climate conditions, approx. 30 million bags of coffee beans are exported annually from Brazil, while domestic consumption is around 10 million bags, which makes Brazil the world's third largest coffeeconsuming country. Considering the year 2002 as a reference, the Brazilian coffee production (Coffea arabica) was 48,480,000 bags, representing 40.6% of the world\u2019s exportation (Cecaf\u00e9 2004). Five states produce coffee in Brazil (Minas Gerais \u2013 50.8%, Esp\u00edrito Santo \u2013 20.1%, S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 12.4%, Paran\u00e1 and Bahia) with several differences in all the production aspects (Aguiar 2001, Igreja and Bliska 2002, Fazuoli et al. 1999, Kashima 1990, Verdade et al. 1974), being the main aspects described below: 1. Size of the coffee production areas. Ranging from a few (familiar properties) to a thousand hectares (company properties) giving diverse producer profiles; 2. Edafoclimatic differences among the cultivation regions. Cultivation areas are mainly located between 10\u201324\u00b0 S latitude and 40\u201354\u00b0 W longitude and show various climate types (semi-humid hot, semi-humid sub-hot, humid sub-hot, super-humid sub-hot, sub-dry and mesothermic); Agriculture Coffee Life Cycle Int J LCA 11 (1) 2006 17 3. Cultivated varieties. The main varieties cultivated in the evaluated regions are Mundo Novo, Catua\u00ed (yellow and red), Icatu (yellow and red), Catuca\u00ed (yellow and red), Obat\u00e3, Acai\u00e1 and Tupi; 4. Adopted spacer. Ranging from traditional (4.0 x 2.5 m) and mechanical harvest (3.5 x 0.7 m) to more compact tillage (2.5 x 0.7 m); 5. Coffee cultivation management. Chemical use (type and quantity) and crop type (manual or mechanical); 6. Local topography conditions. Agricultural machinery and implement use, and adopted spacers; 7. Coffee production and processing technology. Producer revenue and technico-scientific information, besides socioeconomical resources and development of the property. Besides the above geographical factors influencing the coffee quality, the preparation process also directly affects the product quality. There are two coffee preparation methods: the dry method and wet method. Both methods have the following common stages: cleaning, separation, drying, storage, processing and classification (Fig. 1). Additionally, the wet method includes the separation of red coffee berries, pulp remotion, mucilage removal and product washing. In the dry method, the processing stages for preparing the yard coffees can be performed without the use of water. However, the use of water is essential in the wet method for obtaining the washed coffees or coffees without pulp (Alves 1999, Filho et al. 2002, Andrade et al. 1999, Nannetti 1999a\u2013c, Thomaziello 2000a\u2013b, Zambolin 2000). Nowadays there is no environmental criteria established for ecolabel in Brazil, despite the efforts of conducting an LCA of leather in the southern region of Brazil at the beginning of 2000s in order to establish environmental criteria for the ecolabel of shoes. There is a tendency to consider the whole life cycle of the product for the establishment of the environmental criteria for the ecolabel (Canals et al. 2002). Thus, this study was the first LCA conducted for the establishment of an environmental profile of coffee cultivation in Brazil as a basic criteria for the sustainability of green coffee. Food productivity had increased significantly due to new technologies, mechanization, chemical use and governmental policies. However, together with the positive effects on farming, some impacts like degradation of soil and water resources also occur. For instance, the excessive application of fertilizers (quantity and frequency) usually exceeds the soil ability to retain and transform the nutrients and make them available according to the crop needs. According to some studies, the saturation of the soil with nitrogen or phosphate has promoted losses of nitrates into groundwater and saturation of the soil with phosphate, that may also move into groundwater. Regarding pesticide use, these products on a farm level can cause the destruction of part of the soil flora and fauna, that in turn causes both physical and chemical deterioration (Cowell and Cliff 1997, Mattsson and Sonesson 2003, Zalidis et al. 2002). Then, a good control of the amount of inputs added to the tillage is very important from both an environmental aspect and from economic point of view. According to Salomone (2003), the main categories of environmental impact verified in a life cycle assessment study applied to coffee production in the stage of coffee cultivation were eutrophication (320 g.eq PO4/kg of packed coffee) and terrestrial ecotoxicity (approx. 6 t/kg of packed coffee). In this study, the author included all life cycle stages from coffee cultivation through its distribution to consumers, consumption and disposal, aside from fertilizer and pesticide production data employing commercially available databases. Nevertheless, there are also positive effects of agricultural activities in terms of biodiversity protection, carbon capture and oxygen generation. For instance, it was estimated that coffee plants capture approx. 35% as much of the carbon dioxide as the same area of woodlands (Pelupessy 2003).", "year": null}, {"paperId": "6e99574a6c84afa1a90fba4486a376b26525c4f5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2747992127", "CorpusId": 136354729}, "title": "The Way to High Efficiency Boilers for Power Plant Led by Ni-Based Alloy", "abstract": "After the Great East Japan Earthquake, coal-fired power plant is being rediscovered as a reliable and economic source of power that meets Japan\u2019s energy needs (e.g., diversified energy source), because coal can be procured with limited geopolitical risks.

Efficient power generation leads to lower fuel consumption, in turn, lower CO2 emission. Post combustion carbon capture as it can be introduced to existing power plants by retrofitting to the plant, which has attracted a lot of academic and industrial attention. A lot of research activities have been carried out to study this capture technology but most of this research focused on the steady state and the balance of the chemical reaction. As the initial investigation on the power plant response with carbon capture is a very important process before the plant is built, the dynamic simulation study can be helpful to provide the necessary guidance for the design of the plant and control system. This thesis reports the modelling and impact analysis of the supercritical power plant with integration of post combustion carbon capture. The work described in this thesis contributes to three aspects: model based dynamic study of capture plant, model based flue gas estimation and the analysis of power plant response caused by the carbon capture. \n \nA dynamic modular model of the capture plant has been built based on the mass and thermal balance for the study of plant dynamics. In this model, the methodology based on the average enthalpy has been introduced to solve the relationship between the specific enthalpy and the temperature of amine-water \nmixture under different conditions. A model based real-time estimation algorithm for the steam required to satisfy the heat duty is also developed in the work presented in this thesis. \n \nAn accurate flow rate of the flue gas can greatly support the study of the absorption process simulation. An improved coal mill model which provides the estimation of mill status in the normal milling progress is developed in this project. The information provided by this coal mill model can further estimate the flow rate of the flue gas. In addition to supporting the study of carbon capture process, OPC based on-line implementation algorithms are proposed to enhance the mill operation. \n \nThe heat duty to maintain the reaction temperature in the regeneration process is satisfied by the steam from the power plant in this thesis. Several modification plans have been tested in the simulator to study the different dynamic responses to the power plant caused by the steam extraction, and an approach that is able to meet the heat demand with least impact to the plant dynamics is proposed. As coal fired power plants are obliged to balance their output in response to the changing power demand from the grid, this thesis also provides a control strategy to overcome this power penalty by adding the equivalent power to the power demand.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "2409d49c9f577c80e2e6a81b8b0a119ce1525ffa", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 201826043}, "title": "Technical and economic feasibility of the capture and geological storage of CO 2 from a bio-fuel distillery : CPER Artenay project", "abstract": "This paper first focuses on the environmental benefits of the CCS system applied to a bio-ethanol distillery before estimating its feasibility under geological and economic constraints.

This method captures carbon dioxide from point sources of emissions and then stores the carbon dioxide in geological formations. The aim of this thesis is to analyse and compare two different types of combined cycles that are well suited for carbon capture and storage. The cycles are the Graz cycle and the Semi Closed Oxy-fuel Combustion Cycle (SCOC-CC). The power output of the cycles analysed here is around 100MW, which is in the mid-size power output range. The two cycles are compared to a conventional cycle that has a net efficiency of 56%. Two different layouts of the Graz cycle have been compared in this thesis. The first is a more advanced layout that incorporates a second bottoming cycle, which utilizes the heat of condensation from the flue gas condenser. The second layout is a simplified version of the Graz cycle that does not incorporate the second bottoming cycle, and is as such more comparable to the layout of both a conventional combined cycle and the SCOC-CC. The more advanced Graz cycle has around 48% net efficiency, while the simplified Graz cycle and the SCOC-CC has around 46.2% efficiency. Another aim was to develop tools that are able to design the gas turbines that are used in oxy-fuel combustion cycles. The combustion products are mainly steam and carbon dioxide. This influences the properties of the working media in the gas turbines used in the cycles. Traditional design tools for the gas turbine therefore need modification. The thesis describes the conceptual design tool used to design the compressor part of the gas turbines. The tool is based on a one dimensional model that uses empirical data to compute losses. The thesis also describes the development of a two dimensional compressor design method. The Graz cycle has a high water content while the SCOC-CC has a high carbon dioxide content. This difference in the working fluid will result in the turbomachinery being smaller for the Graz cycle compared to the SCOC-CC.

The injection takes place in deep geological formations with the suitable geometrical and petrophysical characteristics to trap CO2 permanently in the subsurface, which is called geological storage. In the development process of a potential geological storage site, correct capacity estimation of the injectable volumes of CO2 is one of the most important aspects. There are various approaches to estimate CO2 storage capacities for potential traps, including geometrical equations, dynamic modelling, numerical modelling and 3D modelling. In this work, the generation of 3D petrophysical models and equations for calculation of the storage volumes are used to estimate the effective storage capacity of four potential saline aquifers in the Adriatic Sea offshore.

A detailed analysis is carried out for each saline aquifer identified, varying the parameters of each structure identified and adapting them for a realistic estimate of potential geological storage capacity.

From there onwards research and development efforts have particularly centred on the reduction of CO2 emissions in the production of electrical power through the use of carbonaceous fossil fuels. The long-term goal is a conversion to sustainable and CO2 free means of producing power, utilizing in the main part renewable forms of energy such as solar, wind and hydro power. Currently, such renewable ways of creating electricity only represent a small percentage of global energy production. The technological and economic hurdles that are associated with a substantial increase of renewable energy production have greatly slowed their increased implementation. However, the goal of keeping the atmospheric CO2 concentration below 450 ppm requires a significantly faster reduction in the amount of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, considerations are being given to bridge technologies which would be able to capture and store the CO2 emissions from fossil fired power plants. These technologies are referred to as CCS (carbon capture and storage). Oxy-fuel combustion, combustion with pure oxygen instead of air, is one of those technologies and forms the focus of investigation of this work. The Institute of Combustion and Power Plant Technology in Stuttgart, Germany, have researched this matter, carrying out combustion experiments in its 150 kWth circulating fluidized bed pilot facility. The experiments were aimed at investigating the influence of excess oxygen, combustion temperature and inlet oxygen concentration on the combustion process and comparing air to oxy-fuel combustion. These results were compared to the results of fundamental investigations and combustion experiments carried out by other research groups.

Consequently, we add a biomass equation into the CoCEB model and analyze the ensuing feedbacks and their effects on per capita gross domestic product (GDP) growth. Integrating biomass into the CoCEB and applying deforestation control as well as CCS technologies has the following results: (i) low investment in CCS contributes to reducing industrial carbon emissions and to increasing GDP, but further investment leads to a smaller reduction in emissions, as well as in the incremental GDP growth; and (ii) enhanced deforestation control contributes to a reduction in both deforestation emissions and in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, thus reducing the impacts of climate change and contributing to a slight appreciation of GDP growth. This effect is however very small compared to that of low-carbon technologies or CCS.

Notably, an interesting result is the fact that, while the carbon capture and storage option is favored in case of bioplants development, appearing as a first climate-protect option, this is not the case with fossil power plants, and renewables development is preferred, even when BECCS is \" excluded \" .", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "5f699fc579dc7fa4d13672b854d71192a3d5810f", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.23919/ICCAS52745.2021.9649777", "CorpusId": 245541888}, "title": "Semantic Segmentation of Outcrop Images using Deep Learning Networks Toward Realization of Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "This study was conducted to classify outcrop images using semantic segmentation methods based on deep learning algorithms.

This study specifically examines outcrops because geological layer measurements can lead to production of a highly accurate geological model for feasible CCS inspections. Using a digital monocular RGB camera, we obtained 13 outcrop images annotated with four classes along with strata. Subsequently, we compared segmentation accuracies with changing input image sizes of three types and semantic segmentation methods of four backbones: SegNet, U-Net, ResNet-18, and Xception-65. The ResNet-18 and Xception-65 backbones were implemented using DeepLabv3+. Experimentally obtained results demonstrated that data expansion with random sampling improved the accuracy. Regarding evaluation metrics, global accuracy and local accuracy are higher than the mean intersection over union (mIoU) for our outcrop image dataset with unequal numbers of pixels in the respective classes. These experimentally obtained results revealed that resizing for input images is unnecessary for our method.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "4d20b502a4080afe55e05addf149977762f44d0c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2967019231", "DOI": "10.3303/CET1972068", "CorpusId": 202213413}, "title": "Rapid One Pot Synthesis of Mesoporous Ceria Nanoparticles by Sol-gel Method for Enhanced Carbon Dioxide Capture", "abstract": "The capture and storage of CO2have been suggested as an effective strategy to reduce the global emissions of greenhouse gases.

The prepared MCN possess high surface area (76.0 m2 g-1) which is around 9-fold higher than that of commercial CeO2 (8.7 m2 g-1), indicating that the organic modification using CTAB is an effective way of preparing a porous structure.

The new materials have hierarchical pore structures containing micropores, mesopores and macropores. We have synthesized various morphologies of the MOF compound Cr-MIL-101 to combine with Da in a one-pot reaction step. These distinctive hierarchical pore networks within Cr-MIL-101@Da enable exceptional adsorptive performance for a range of molecules, including hydrogen (H2), carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) vapor. Selectivity for H2 or CO2 can be moderated by the morphology and composition of the Cr-MIL-101 included in the Cr-MOF@Da composite. The encapsulation and growth of Cr-MIL-101 within and on Da have resulted in excellent water retention as well as high thermal and hydrolytic stability. In some cases, Cr-MIL-101@Da composite materials have demonstrated increased thermal stability compared with that of Cr-MIL-101; for example, decomposition temperatures >340 \u2103 can be achieved. Furthermore, these Cr-MIL-101@Da composites retain structural and morphological integrity after 60 cycles of repeated hydration/dehydration, and after storage for more than one year. These characteristics are difficult to achieve with many MOF materials, and thus suggest that MOF\u2013mineral composites show high potential for practical gas storage and water vapor capture.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "76f17aa726545d10d287f11c068d39c6b30e4b9c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2991339709", "DOI": "10.1039/9781788012744-00168", "CorpusId": 212909320}, "title": "Chapter 6.

A pulverized coal-fired power plant and a natural gas combined cycle will be analysed as case studies for oxy-combustion and the benefits of using pure oxygen will be discussed as well as how the changes in the thermodynamic properties affect boiler operation. Purification of carbon dioxide in the resulting flue gas to pipeline transport specifications will end the discussion of this chapter with two examples of gas processing units. The parasitic power consumption of this gas processing unit combined with the air separation unit reduces the net efficiency of the plant even though the thermal efficiency is increased, which emphasises the importance of developing new technologies, such as ion transport membranes for oxygen production.

In the United States, there is currently a public policy debate over the use of coal to produce liquid transportation fuels to increase energy security and decrease dependence on imported petroleum and refined products. There are a number of challenges to be faced by a possible CTL industry, and one of the largest relates to the magnitude of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) generated, from synthetic fuel production as well as from the combustion of the synthetic transportation fuel itself. CO 2 , produced by conversion of hydrocarbons to energy, primarily via fossil fuel combustion, is one of the most ubiquitous and significant greenhouse gases (GHGs). Concerns over climate change precipitated by rising atmospheric GHG concentrations have prompted many industrialized nations to begin adopting limits on emissions to inhibit increases in atmospheric CO 2 levels. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change states as a key goal the stabilization of atmospheric GHGs at a level that prevents \"dangerous anthropogenic interference\" with the world's climate systems. This will require sharply reducing CO 2 emissions across the globe, and ultimately a fundamental shift in the way in which energy is produced and consumed. This article provides an overview of the challenge posed by the magnitude of CO 2 that would be produced from a developing CTL industry. The status and costs associated with carbon dioxide capture and geologic storage (CCS) technologies are discussed as a means of helping to mitigate the CO 2 issue, along with remaining challenges that must be overcome for an emerging CTL industry to move toward maturity. However, even if CCS can be safely and successfully applied to CTL plants, CO 2 emissions will still likely be greater than conventional liquid transportation fuel production from conventional petroleum.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "7ee87e619cd3aa2fda67713c3fb2cba1e1d84b52", "externalIds": {"MAG": "38384757", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-4614-2215-0_2", "CorpusId": 127250596}, "title": "Compression and Transport of CO2", "abstract": "Following capture and separation of CO2 from a gas mixture, the CO2 must be compressed for transport, regardless of whether it is destined for storage in underground geologic reservoirs or used as a feedstock in chemical processing, aggregate formation, or EOR. There are various modes of transport such as rail, ship, truck, and pipeline. On average, a single 500-MW coal-fired power plant would need to transport on the order of 2\u20133 Mt per year of compressed CO2, which makes pipeline transport a feasible option due to the potential large-scale application (Energy Conv Manag 45(15\u201316):2343\u20132353, 2004). For instance, the installed capacity in the U.S. is approximately 315 gigawatts (GW) (EIA Existing Electric Generating Units by Energy Source; Energy Information Administration (EIA), Department of Energy (DOE): Washington, D.C., 2008), China\u2019s installed capacity of coal-fired power is approximately 600 GW and India\u2019s approximately 100 GW. The installed capacity in China and India will undoubtedly grow since as of 2009 these regions had populations of 186 million (China and East Asia) and 612 million (South Asia) without electricity (World Energy Outlook. Accessed August 13, 2011). China, U.S., and India are the top three coal producers, with production of 2716, 993, and 484 million tons produced in 2008, respectively (World Energy Outlook. Accessed August 13, 2011). With this heavy reliance on coal for advancing electrification in these regions, there will be an inevitable increase in CO2 emissions.

Technological pathways to a low carbon economy include improving resource application/energy intensity, or by cutting carbon intensity through promoting low carbon technologies such as renewable energy or carbon capture and storage (CCS). For these technologies to be a truly effective option to mitigate climate change, they must be sustainable and be protective of the environment and human health over the long-term. Whilst analysis of most initiatives focuses on direct GHG quantification, other benefits and potential impacts are often not considered, and indirect emissions are often overlooked. In this chapter, the benefits of adapting to a low carbon economy are assessed, and technological adaptation strategies discussed along with associated impacts to human health and the environment. In particular, CCS is focused upon and life cycle assessment (LCA) shown as a particularly useful tool to give a holistic view of the impacts relating to mitigation options.

From a geophysical perspective this is challenging as a CO2 plume has a severe imprint on seismic data. While this makes delineation of the plume rather straightforward, for quantitative interpretation a technique is required that takes complex wave propagation, including multiple scattering and mode conversions into account. In this abstract a wave-equation based AVO technique is discussed and successfully demonstrated on a seismic dataset from the Sleipner site. The technique solves the exact wave-equation which means that tuning effects are properly modelled. The scheme directly inverts for compressibility and shear compliance as these parameters are more closely related to saturation than conventional impedances. From this the total amount of injected CO2 is calculated and found to be in good agreement with the known value at the time when the data was acquired. \u00a9 2018 European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers, EAGE.

Introducing CCS to abate emissions appears more and more as incontrovertible to reduce future CO2 emissions in line with the consensual limit of 2\u00b0C temperature increase (IPCC, 2007b). This all the more if we consider that fossil fuels will remain the dominant sources of energy over the next decades and that, as a result, CO2 emissions will drastically increase to reach unsustainable levels. Furthermore, among the technological options to mitigate CO2 emissions, BECCS is gaining increasing attention, as this alternative offers a unique opportunity for a net carbon removal from the atmosphere while fulfilling energy needs (Herzog et al., 2005;Azaret al., 2006;van Vuuren et al., 2007; Katofsky et al., 2010).", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "3b37be5b28d2077b04354c914afd7bd47bb5e9d3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3024048604", "DOI": "10.3390/en13102427", "CorpusId": 219468480}, "title": "Development of a Model for the Estimation of the Energy Consumption Associated with the Transportation of CO2 in Pipelines", "abstract": "All Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects require the transportation of CO2 from a source to a storage location.
