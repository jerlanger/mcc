To address these problems, firstly, the EEMD-LSTM-SVR algorithm is proposed to forecast wind power in the Belgian grid in order to tackle the uncertainty and strong volatility of wind power. Furthermore, the conventional thermal power plant is transformed into an integrated carbon capture power plant containing split-flow and liquid storage type, and the low-carbon mechanism of the two approaches is adequately discussed to give the low-carbon realization mechanism of the power system. Secondly, the mathematical model of EEMD-LSTM-SVR algorithm and the integrated low-carbon economic dispatch model are constructed. Finally, the simulation is verified in a modified IEEE-39 node system with carbon capture power plant. Compared with conventional thermal power plants, the carbon emissions of integrated carbon capture plants will be reduced by 78.248%; the abandoned wind of split carbon capture plants is reduced by 53.525%; the total cost of wind power for dispatch predicted using the EEMD-LSTM-SVR algorithm will be closer to the actual situation, with a difference of only USD 60.

Methane enriched with hydrogen or diluted with carbon dioxide are of considerable interest. The latter seems quite relevant for development of technologies such as oxyfuel combustion for carbon capture and storage in order to control temperatures in the combustion chamber. Thus, this paper presents an experimental study on the combustion of methane-carbon dioxide mixtures at atmospheric conditions. Gas mixtures have been examined by using different levels of premixing with different injection strategies with and without swirl and with and without central injection. A 20 kW burner has been used to investigate the flame stability and emissions performance by using these blends to examine the effect of CO2 addition. The burner configuration consisted of a centre body with an annular, premixed gas/air jet introduced through five, 60\u00b0 swirl vanes. A TESTO 350XL gas analyzer was used to obtain NOx and CO emission trends to characterize all the injection regimes whilst using different fuel blends. CH chemiluminescence diagnostics was also used and correlated to the levels of emissions produced during the trials. The resulting images were analysed using Photron FASTCAM PFV ver 2.4.1.1 software and MATLAB R2015a. CO2 dilution decreased flame stability and operability range. The introduction of CO2 reduces temperatures in the combustion zone thus causing a reduction in emissions of nitrous oxides across all equivalence ratios. CO emissions also decreased with a limited (15%) CO2 addition. In terms of injection regimes, the outer purely premixed injection regime has lower NOx and CO, as expected.

In this contribution, we present a framework to design CO2 soluble thickeners, combining calculations using a quantum mechanical solvation model with direct laboratory viscosity testing. The conductor-like polarizable continuum model for solvation free-energy calculations was used to determine functional silicone and silsesquioxane solubilities in scCO2. This method allowed for a fast and efficient identification of CO2-soluble compounds, revealing silsesquioxanes as more CO2-philic than linear polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), the most efficient non-fluorinated thickener know to date. The rolling ball apparatus was used to measure the viscosity of scCO2 with both PDMS and silicone resins with added silica nanoparticles. Methyl silicone resins were found to be stable and fast to disperse in scCO2 while having a significant thickening effect. They have a larger effect on the solution viscosity than higher-molecular-weight PDMS and are able to thicken CO2 even at high temperatures. Silicone resins are thus shown to be promising scCO2 thickeners, exhibiting enhanced solubility and good rheological properties, while also having a moderate cost and being easily commercially attainable.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "c5f9dfff0f25a852a032bf8032f64adf59b3e80e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "348705243", "CorpusId": 152731497}, "title": "Research or Carbon Capture and Storage \u2013 How to limit climate change?", "abstract": "The consequences of the 2\u00b0C climate target and the implicitly imposed ceiling on CO2 have been analyzed in several studies.

If the gains of CCS, in terms of lower energy costs, outweigh the gains of R&D and capital accumulation, investments are reallocated towards CCS. On the one hand, this reduces the investments into R&D and/or capital. On the other hand, lower energy costs may increase research and/or capital investments. Positive CCS investments allow a higher extraction of fossil fuel, which implies lower backstop utilization. Consequently, CCS investments lower the advantageousness of R&D ceteris paribus.

The Gorgon project could be expected to succeed, as it has the backing of government, a practical and economic reason for removing CO2, a history of previous exploration, nearby storage sites, experienced operators and managers, and long-term taxpayer liability for problems.

These factors include the commercial imperatives of the operation, the lack of incentives, the complexity of the process, the presence of ignored routine problems, geological issues (even in a well-explored area), technical failures, regulatory threats even if minor, tax issues, and the project increasing emissions and consuming carbon budgets despite claims otherwise.

If the gas production rate exceeds the gas diffusion rate within the pores of the clay, a discrete gas phase will form and accumulate until its pressure becomes large enough to exceed the entry pressure of the surrounding material. \nThe purpose of Task A under DECOVALEX-2019 is to better understand the processes governing the advective movement of gas in both low-permeability argillaceous repository host rocks and clay-based engineered barriers. Special attention is given to the mechanisms controlling gas entry, flow and pathway sealing and their impact on the performance of the engineered clay barrier. Previous work suggests gas flow may be accompanied by the creation of dilatant pathways whose properties change temporally and spatially within the medium. Thus, new numerical representations for the quantitative prediction of gas migration fluxes through argillaceous rock formations have been developed. These provide an invaluable tool with which to assess the impact of gas flow on repository layout and therefore design of any future facility.

This is justified as CO2 capture is often one of the more expensive components of any geological sequestration capture, transportation and storage chain. As such, much emphasis is currently being placed in the advancement of processes such as increasing capture efficiency and reducing capture cost which are demonstrated by the many pilot plants being built worldwide. \n \nCarbon capture essentially produces a concentrated stream of CO2 at high pressure, rendering it to be readily transported to appropriate storage sites. Although theoretically the entire gas can be transported using the various transportation modes, the cost associated with doing this often deems this option impractical. Extracting the CO2 in a more concentrated form and elevating it to the required high pressure is therefore an important component of the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) chain. \n \nFor Trinidad and Tobago (T&T), post combustion capture is most desirous as the targeted CO2 sources emanate from existing plants. This is so because physical space at these plants is limited and does not readily allow for precombustion technologies. While oxyfuel combustion may be applicable to some of the existing plants, since the sources being evaluated in this paper are related emissions from Ammonia Synthesis and Power Generation, the concentration of CO2 in these streams is either already high and commensurate with that of oxyfuel carbon capture (as it the case with Ammonia) or the plants cannot be easily retrofitted for oxyfuel capture (as with the Power Generation). Interestingly, most of T&T\u2019s emissions (over 50%) emanate from the petrochemical sector and in particular from Ammonia production processes. There are eleven (11) Ammonia plants in T&T which contributes to the nation being the number one exporter of this commodity globally. During the synthesis of Ammonia, a relatively pure stream of CO2 is produced in the process typically consisting of over 90% CO2 with some mostly water vapour as the other impurity. One can therefore argue that to an extent the CO2 is already captured. Further purification of the CO2 stream via water vapour, oxygen separation and pressurization is all that is needed for engagement in CCS projects. \n \nThis paper investigates CO2 capture from Ammonia Plants and compares it with CO2 capture from Power Plants in TT Ammonia and Power). These simulations were then used as the primary tool to estimate CO2 capture cost for T&T from Ammonia synthesis and Power Generation. Of particular interest for T&T, this study illustrates an estimate of the costs for capturing up to 8 Mt/yr of CO2. It is expected that this information can be critical in evaluating the overall CCS economics for T&T and can contribute towards a suitable pilot project.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "6dd6a16017cf5c67807071d4f2b38fc3e7b5ed43", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3168150201", "DOI": "10.2139/SSRN.3820843", "CorpusId": 236742106}, "title": "Effects of Plant Scale on Flexible Operation of Amine-based CO2 Capture Processes", "abstract": "The transition of energy systems to meet net-zero targets for CO2 emissions will require increased integration of intermittent renewable energy.

However, one of the main byproducts from consuming fossil fuels is CO2, a greenhouse gas that can cause climate change and ultimately threaten the survival of humanity. An alarming statistic published in 2008 shows that a nearly 40% of 5.8 billion metric tons of the total US anthropogenic CO2 emissions was resulted from burning fossil fuels for power generation [1]. Therefore, to effectively mitigate CO2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels has drawn a great deal of attentions in recent years at all levels of our society. It has risen to be not only a scientific topic but also a political agenda. Among all the options available, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is regarded as the sole practical solution to achieve considerable CO2 emission reduction from fossil-fueled power plants in a near term [1]. To realize the ultimate CO2 storage, separation and capture of CO2 from a CO2-containing process stream is the first step. The CO2 capture technologies currently being developed and demonstrated are targeting at three different stages/processes depending on the type of a power plant: post-combustion, oxyfuel combustion and pre-combustion [2-3]. The existing state-of-the-art CO2 capture technologies are primarily based on chemical/ physical absorptions by a liquid solvent or a solid sorbent and are yet ready for commercialization at the larger scale necessary for power plant application. The parasitic loads (steam and power) required to support CO2 capture would decrease power generation capacity by nearly one-third and increase levelized cost-ofelectricity (COE) by as much as 80%. Even if successfully scaled up, it would not be cost effective at their current level of process development [1]. In contrast, membrane-based CO2 capture technology presents cost advantages when applied to preand postcombustion CO2 capture: no steam or chemical load, delivering high-pressure CO2 and driving CO shifting reaction to completion. However, the major challenges are the limited selectivity, thus product purity, and poor compatibility with high-temperature process stream. Therefore, developing an alternative high-temperature membrane technology to separate/capture CO2 more selectively and efficiently for existing power plants is in great need. One category of gas separation membranes that has the potential to meet these requirements is the mixed ionic and electronic conductors. An electrochemical transport membrane only allows the electrochemically active species to transport through the membrane. Therefore, its selectivity is exclusive. Since this membrane normally operates at elevated temperatures, it also has an excellent compatibility with any high-temperature process stream. The key feature of these materials is the concomitant fast ionic and electronic transport enabling high flux. Applying this principle to the CO2 separation membrane, two types of mixed conductors can be envisioned: 1) mixed carbonate-ion and oxide-ion conductor (MOCC); 2) mixed carbonate-ion and electron conductor (MECC). Fig. 1 shows the working principles of these two membranes along with CO2-separation enabling surface reactions. Based on these fundamental reactions, it is evident that MOCC is more suitable for CO2 separation from a reducing stream such as water-gas shift gas (CO2+H2) where the chemical gradients of CO2 and O2 exist in opposite direction across the membrane. On the other hand, MECC is more adequate for CO2 separation from an oxidizing stream such as flue gas (CO2, O2, N2) where the chemical gradients of CO2 and O2 exist in the same direction across the membrane. In this case, both CO2 and O2 will permeate through the membrane, the mixture of which can be further separated by a downstream OTM or recycled back to the combustion chamber for oxy-combustion [3].", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "958a1bfe6d9d7a9841bc2d1b36806259af98aa9d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2292615302", "CorpusId": 55473895}, "title": "The Capture of Carbon Dioxide from the Power Plant Flue Gas", "abstract": "The capture & separation of carbon dioxide is the premise of its storage and utilization.

This study describes an economic storage model which enables the user to identify the most economic utilization of one specific cavern storage site. Salt caverns represent the most flexible large-scale geological storage. Currently, salt caverns are mainly in use as seasonal gas storage. Europe offers a high potential for further cavern storage use. The model includes technical properties of salt caverns as storage facilities, and hydrogen, compressed air, methane and carbon dioxide as storage media.

The model suggests, based on the expected market development, the most attractive storage medium to maximize the overall discounted earnings. Potential storage costs for each application are compared with economic gains or cost savings (e.g. avoided carbon tax, revenues from peak-load sale of electricity, etc.) which are generated by an optimal time-dependent usage of the stored medium.

Amongst other options like adoption of renewables on a much larger scale, fuel switching, and increasing power system efficiency; carbon capture and storage is perceived to be another feasible option for meeting this global climate mitigation target.

ST\u2019s triboelectric separation process reduces the carbon content of fly ash, producing ProAsh a consistent, low loss on ignition (LOI) ash for use as a substitute for cement in concrete. Simultaneously a carbon rich product, EcoTherm is created that can be returned to the utility for recovery of the fuel value or to a cement kiln as both fuel and a source clinker material. ST also operates a process to remove excess ammonia from fly ash. In 2008, ST commissioned its newest and largest US fly ash beneficiation facility at the Tampa Electric Company Big Bend Station in Florida. Two ST separators are installed to produce low LOI ProAsh. A first-of-its-kind third separator is used to further concentrate the carbon to maximize the fuel value of the EcoTherm and to maximize the amount of ProAsh recovered. At Big Bend the ST ammonia process reduces the ash ammonia from average levels of ~ 2000 ppm to <75 ppm to meet market requirements. Improvements in this second commercial installation of the ST ammonia system include higher rate capability, improved drying efficiency, and use of a catalytic system to recover heat by converting the liberated ammonia gas into nitrogen. The Big Bend facility, which will produce 260,000 tons per year ProAsh includes a 25,000 ton dome for feed ash, a 10,000 ton silo for ProAsh and a 6,500 ton silo for EcoTherm.

CO2-Argon-Steam-Oxy (CARSOXY)-fuel gas turbines are an innovative example that integrates CCS with gas turbine powergen improvement. Replacing air-fuel combustion by CARSOXY combustion has been theoretically proven to increase gas turbine efficiency. Therefore, this paper provides a novel approach to continuously supply a gas turbine with a CARSOXY blend within required molar fractions. The approach involves H2 and N2 production, therefore having the potential of also producing ammonia. Thus, the concept allows CARSOXY cycles to be used to support production of ammonia whilst increasing power efficiency. An ASPEN PLUS model has been developed to demonstrate the approach. The model involves the integrations of an air separation unit (ASU), a steam methane reformer (SMR), water gas shift (WGS) reactors, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) units and heat exchanged gas turbines (HXGT) with a CCS unit. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the ASU-SMR-WGS-PSA-CCS-HXGT model. The results provide a baseline to calibrate the model in order to produce the required CARSOXY molar fraction. A MATLAB code has also been developed to study CO2 compression effects on the CARSOXY gas turbine compressor. Thus, this paper provides a detailed flowsheet of the WGS-PSA-CCS-HXGT model. The paper provides the conditions in which the sensitivity analyses have been conducted to determine the best operable regime for CARSOXY production with other high valuable gases (i.e., hydrogen). Under these specifications, the sensitivity analyses on the (SMR) sub-model spots the H2O mass flow rates, which provides the maximum hydrogen level, the threshold which produces significant CO2 levels. Moreover, splitting the main CH4 supply to sub-supply a SMR reactor and a furnace reactor correlates to best practices for CARSOXY. The sensitivity analysis has also been performed on the (ASU) sub-model to characterise its response with respect to the variation of air flow rate, distillation/boiling rates, product/feed stage locations and the number of stages of the distillation columns. The sensitivity analyses have featured the response of the ASU-SMR-WGS-PSA-CCS-HXGT model.

The contribution of anthropogenic emissions to the intensification of the greenhouse effect and consequent environmental change shows, once again, the need to find mitigation measures to the problem. In this context, the technology of Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Geological Storage (BECCS) has emerged as a promising alternative for reducing emissions. BECCS projects are based on the concept of generating negative emissions by capturing CO2 from the biomass burning or processing, for example, for biofuel production, and storage in geological reservoirs. The implementation of such projects in Brazil is interesting due to two factors: a) the significant production of ethanol from biomass and b) the occurrence of extensive sedimentary basins with potential reservoirs for storage. This study aims to determine the potential to reduce Brazilian emissions through geological storage of carbon dioxide resulting from ethanol production. Thus, the source-sink matching methodology was applied using a Geographic Information System (GIS) with georeferenced data from stationary emission sources (ethanol plants), transport networks (pipelines) and storage sites (wells and sedimentary basins). In this way, it was possible to determine areas (clusters) with potential for deployment of BECCS projects, evaluating them in terms of volume of CO2 emissions (CO2 avoided potential).", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "52dce6d75be8cdb9590a301dc0eba54564d62fce", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2096475714", "DOI": "10.2478/nuka-2014-0001", "CorpusId": 55918442}, "title": "The applicability of C-14 measurements in the soil gas for the assessment of leakage out of underground carbon dioxide reservoirs", "abstract": "Abstract Poland, due to the ratification of the Kioto Protocol, is obliged to diminish the emission of greenhouse gases. One of the possible solutions of this problem is CO2 sequestration (CCS - carbon capture and storage). Such an option is a priority in the European Union. On the other hand, CO2 sequestration may be potentially risky in the case of gas leakage from underground reservoirs. The most dangerous event may be a sudden release of the gas onto the surface. Therefore, it is very important to know if there is any escape of CO2 from underground gas reservoirs, created as a result of sequestration. Such information is crucial to ensure safety of the population in areas located above geological reservoirs. It is possible to assess the origin of carbon dioxide, if the measurement of radiocarbon 14C concentration in this gas is done. If CO2 contains no 14C, it means, that the origin of the gas is either geological or the gas has been produced as a result of combustion of fossil fuels, like coal. A lot of efforts are focused on the development of monitoring methods to ensure safety of CO2 sequestration in geological formations. A radiometric method has been tested for such a purpose. The main goal of the investigations was to check the application possibility of such a method. The technique is based on the liquid scintillation counting of samples. The gas sample is at first bubbled through the carbon dioxide adsorbent, afterwards the adsorbent is mixed with a dedicated cocktail and measured in a low-background liquid scintillation spectrometer Quantulus.

It is based on a survey of a d v a d batteries conducted by the author for the Califomia Air Resources Board in the first half of 1999. Hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) concepts and technology are still evolving, as are the associated requirements for energy storage. The most important requirements atablished or implied for several generic HEV typa are discussed to help judge the applicability of candidate batteries. On that basis, high power versions of nickel-metal hydride, lead acid, and lithium ion batteries meet the performance requirements for the power assidregeneration BEV application. Nickel-metal hydride, lithium ion and lithium polymer batteries appear suited for hybrid electric vehicles that have significant driving range on battery power alone. The status of these technologies and their prospects for availability w i t h the nexl 3-5 years are discussed. The emergence of hybrid electric vehicles promises viable markets for advanced batteries (as well as for electric power conversion, control and motor technologies) in electric transportation Hybrid electric vehicles especially those with significant battery-only driving range also might become stepping stones in the commercial introduction of electric vehicles that take advantage of the remarkable advances in battery technolog achieved over the past five years. Introduction The successful introduction of Toyota\u2019s PRIUS hybrid vehicle in Japan and the announcements by Ronda and Toyota of plans to introduce their hybrid vehicles in the U.S. market have dramaiically increased interest in this new automotive product. Automobile mnufacturets, regulators and environmentalists see HEVs as a potentially major avenue to increasing vehicle energy efficiency and reducing the emissions of air pollutants. Enam and environmental policy leaders view HEVs especialiy those that derive a significant portion of the propulsion energy from electricity as a stratqy to replace imported oil with domestic energy resources and reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide. Final@, electric utilities consider grid-connected hybrid electric vehicles a possible business opportunity. Batteries are an essential component of the hybrid electric vehicle types currently under development. In the functionally simplest KEV concept, the battery is employed to store energy captured in regenerative braking plus make-up energy provided by the engine, to keep the battery at approximately 50% state-ofcharge (SoC). The stored energy is used as needed to start the vehicle\u2019s combustion engine and assist the engine during acceleration. The Toyota PRIUS and Honda\u2019s recently announced INSIGHT HEV are exampIes of this \u201cPower AssisuRegmration\u201d (PAIR) -hybrid electric vehicle. Most of the hybrid vehicles currently under development at the three major U.S. carmakers also fall in this cntegoty. This type of HEV requires only a rather small battery that, however, must have very high specific power capability, as discussed below. Hybrid batteries and their controI systems can be designed to supplement not only the power but also the energy delivered by the combustion engine. In that case, the battery is charged by an off-board power source, and it gives the vehicle a limited range over which it can be driven with battery power only, with the associated advantages of zero local emissions and yet lower consumption of oil-derived fuels. Prototypes of hybrid electric vehicles with usable electric range termed \u201cgrid-connected\u201d, \u201ccharge-depletion\u201d or, in this paper, electric-range (ER) HEVs have been demonstrated. ER hybrids must meet different requirements, as discussed below. Yet another type of hybrid electric vehicle is created if a very smdl combustion engine is added to an electric vehicle to provide emergency driving rangeFrom a battery standpoint, there is little if any difference between the type of battery required for this \u201crange extender\u201d HEV and those for \u201cpure\u201d battery-powered electric vehicles.

Contaminants of concern include aqueous salts and dissolved solids, gaseous or aqueous-phase organic contaminants, and acidic gas or aqueous-phase fluids that can liberate metals from aquifer minerals. Understanding the mechanisms and parameters that can contribute to leakage of the CO2 and the ultimate impact on shallow water aquifers that overlie injection formations is an important step in evaluating the efficacy and risks associated with long-term CO2 storage.

While difficulties remain for employing carbon capture technologies at a competitive cost, the injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) into underground storage reservoirs is a well-understood process.

The amount of CO2 rose from 280 ppm in 1750 to 388 ppm in 2010. This increasing amount of GHGs gases, specifically CO2, is the underlying cause of global warming. According to the IPCC report, with the current rate of emissions, the average global temperature would increase by between 1.9 to 5.4 oC by the end of the 21st century. There is a consensus that the current growth rate of energy consumption and CO2 emissions cannot endure in the future if the disastrous global warming is to be prevented. It has been predicted that global energy consumption will be doubled by the year 2050 if the present trend continues. Thus, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in line with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in order to take measures for reduction and stabilization of GHG gasses. The most important measure for mitigation of CO2 is implementation of sustainable energy generation, which requires major large-scale changes in our energy infrastructure. In other words, it is until recently that climate change and sustainable development started to become points of concern in the energy-oriented fields. These issues bring many controversies and discussions among politicians, scientist and the public. There is a myriad of different approaches on how to preempt the climate change and leap towards a more sustainable world. Carbon capture and storage technology is one of the alternatives which can be used as a measure to this end. However, CCS is considered as a medium-run \u201cbridging\u201d option for the reduction of CO2, given the still high cost of renewable energy in combination with deceptively sufficient amounts of fossil fuel. Moreover, CCS is one of the most controversial topics in the field of sustainable development with a rich vein of oppositions. The main objective of this research is to investigate the cost effectiveness and benefit of carbon capture and storage technology. Cost \u2013 benefit analysis is a tool which the author deploys to assess CCS. The case study of this research is the Netherlands. The calculations are based on the costs for CCS with a special focus on its technological improvements mainly derived from Dutch context. The main research question for this study is: What is the importance of CCS for the mitigation of the greenhouse gas, and consequently climate change from technical and economic point of view? In order to answer that question, the above is decomposed to the following sub-questions: \u0095 What is the current local (i.e. the Netherlands) and global state of Carbon Capture and Storage technology? \u0095 What is the current and future state of CCS in the Netherlands? \u0095 What are the costs of CCS per each stage and in total? \u0095 What is the benefit of carbon capture and storage? \u0095 Is implementation of CCS profitable? The Netherlands has substantial fossil fuels resources, mainly natural gas. Hence, the Netherlands and Norway, which is another important fossil fuel producer, have an inclination to play important roles in deployment and development of CCS in the Europe. There are many stakeholders in diverse fields which are involved in this technology in the Netherlands. Indeed, there are notable national and international projects such as CATO2 that are aimed to develop CCS technologically and economically. Moreover, the Netherlands has a good potential for implementation of CCS with regards to the transportation and storage. Due to the existence of gas network and several depleted hydrocarbon fields, mainly in northern areas, for CO2 storage in the Netherlands, there are good infrastructures for captured CO2. In this study, I lay emphasis on two major types of power plants: Existing PC power plants and New IGCC power plants; since they are more applicable for the Netherlands. In addition, using results of other studies, different ranges of costs (low, medium and maximum) for both cases are estimated. The challenging part of this study is choosing the benefit for the implementation of carbon capture and storage. Since this technology has not run on a large scale yet, it is not easy to talk about its economic benefits. After substantial investigations and discussions with experts, I concluded to consider social cost of carbon as a benefit of CCS. Afterwards, to enhance the precision of the analysis it was very important to choose proper figures for SCC so that a wider range of studies are covered. I selected four studies among several ones. With regards to four diverse SCC from different studies, with varying assumed discount rates, I perform the cost-benefit analysis for low, medium and high costs of CCS. This analysis leads to 12 sets of scenarios for existing and new power plants. In case of existing power plants, the results shows that with consideration of very low social cost of carbon, CCS implementation will not be beneficial at all even with the minimum cost of CCS. Conversely, according to high social cost of carbon, CCS implementation is notably beneficial even base on the maximum cost of CCS. The story is the same for new IGCC power plants but the benefits base on high social cost of carbon is significant. Moreover, except the analysis based on the lowest social cost of carbon, in most of the scenarios based on other three studies, implementation of carbon capture and storage system would be beneficial economically with regards to climate change. However, it is important to add that there are many studies on SCC base on different discount rates but I tried to choose maximum and minimum figures among the recent studies which are carried out from mid 90s forward. In addition, in this cost-benefit analysis I just considered social cost of carbon as a benefit of carbon capture and storage. Whereas, definitely, there are other benefits in implementation of CCS in terms of economic. This rings true that in the future by decreasing the cost of CCS due to technological development in line with recognition of other benefits of CCS, this technology would be more beneficial and feasible to implement as a measure for hindrance of diverse effect of climate change. Finally, in the future studies it will be needed to cover more elements than SCC in order to perform a more precise analysis. This needs substantial time, budget and a team of researchers. In addition, due to more or less unknown benefit of CCS, recent studies are vastly qualitative rather than quantitative. The lack of further quantitative studies is more palpable since their inherent objectiveness appeals more to policy makers and authorities.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "e1b5f2ab17320e7f4375198e0f0fef3f8924ecc5", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 201049887}, "title": "Numerical simulation of a high temperature CO 2 capture fluidized bed", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage technologies are the most hopeful solutions to reduce the CO2 emissions on fossil fuel power plants.

The most notable aspect of the whole process is the way by which carbon dioxide is separate from the syngas in the aforementioned carbon capture unit, called carbonator. A good looking route seems to be the high temperature Chemical Looping Carbon Capture (CLCC). In this approach, a porous solid sorbent captures the carbon dioxide by means of a chemi-sorption process. Once the solid sorbent reaches at its ultimate conversion, it is sent back to the regeneration step and a high-concentrated CO2 stream is released and sent to final disposal. Particularly, calcined dolomite is selected as CO2-acceptor due its excellent experimental performance.

Th e technology is under development; a number of technological, economic, environmental and safety issues remain to be solved. With regard to possible trajectories towards a sustainable electricity system, CCS raises a number of questions. On the one hand, CCS may prolong the prevailing coal-to-electricity regime and countervail eff orts to increase energy effi ciency. On the other hand, given the indisputable need to continue using fossil fuels for some time, it may serve as a bridging technology towards a sustainable energy future. Energy effi ciency could then be conceptualized as a natural ally of CCS, as it aims at reducing the consumption of energy and thus the amount of CO 2 to be captured and stored. We discuss these issues for the case of Germany. Aft er a survey of the current state of the art of CCS deployment and activities, we use a general equilibrium model to analyze the impact of introducing CCS to the German electricity system with respect to the energy and technology mix, the resulting CO 2 emissions and the interaction with energy effi ciency measures. Th e model shows that, under the assumption of a CO 2 policy, both energy effi ciency and CCS will contribute to climate gas mitigation. A given climate target can be achieved at lower marginal costs when the option of CCS is included in the analysis.. We conclude that, given an appropriate legal and policy framework, CCS and energy effi ciency are complementary measures and should both form part of a broad mix of measures required for a successful CO 2 mitigation strategy.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "0b9e98ec6035f962dbdc9c97d50cdac33ac7a050", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2332172382", "DOI": "10.2118/177561-MS", "CorpusId": 101615284}, "title": "Chemical Looping Combustion: an Emerging Carbon Capture Technology", "abstract": "Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is a promising technology for energy production with inherent capture of carbon dioxide at minimal energy penalty. In CLC, oxygen is transferred from an air reactor to a fuel reactor by means of a solid oxygen carrier. Direct contact between air and fuel is avoided, resulting in an undiluted CO2 exhaust stream. As such, CLC was picked up recently as a high potential carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. While initial focus was on storage projects, CO2 is more and more considered as a valuable chemical substance for enhanced oil/gas recovery projects as well as for the production of chemicals, polymers or building materials. A critical aspect of the CLC technology is the oxygen carrier performance which has a very strong impact on the economic viability. Parameters such as particle size, density, porosity, strength, attrition resistance, reactivity, environmental aspects and cost, define the performance of the oxygen carrier. The first generation oxygen carriers was Ni-based. However, due to cost of nickel and toxicity, a search for Ni-free oxygen carriers was conducted with similar or superior performance in CLC. This lead to the development of Cu-, Fe and Mn-based oxygen carriers, that demonstrate the beneficial oxygen uncoupling effect, with complete fuel conversion as a result. In this contribution it is shown that the industrial spray-drying technique is a very versatile and scalable technique for the fabrication of oxygen carriers. New and promising oxygen carriers with varying compositions, good fluidisability, high sphericity, high attrition resistance, and homogeneity on the micro-scale have been synthesized. Different materials such as perovskite type materials based on calcium-manganate, magnesium manganates, copper based materials, and iron manganates have been investigated for their performance with promising results towards complete combustion and high attrition resistance.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "6322f0d5094e5ed243f057188abfb6dc171142c3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3010948044", "DOI": "10.1007/s11625-020-00791-0", "CorpusId": 212641719}, "title": "On the feasibility of cropland and forest area expansions required to achieve long-term temperature targets", "abstract": "Biomass-based negative emission technologies (NETs) such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation/reforestation (AR) are regarded as important options to achieve the 2\u00a0\u00b0C and 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C targets stipulated in the Paris agreement, but the feasibility of their large-scale deployments remains very uncertain. This study focused on the speed of expansions of land-use area related to the biomass-based NETs and assessed the feasibility of climate change mitigation scenarios to achieve the temperature targets. Our model analysis shows that expansions at unprecedented speeds are required for total cropland area (including energy cropland) in Sub-Saharan Africa and for planted forest area for carbon sink in many regions in the next decades, under the assumption of global least-cost measures for CO 2 emission reduction. On the other hand, when the speed of the land-use expansions is limited as observed in the real world, the CO 2 emission reduction costs become unrealistically high around the middle of this century, particularly in scenarios for the 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C target; relatively low-cost measures such as BECCS in Sub-Saharan Africa and AR in many regions are limited in deployment due to the limited speed of the land-use expansion, and yet energy systems must be transformed to nearly net-zero/negative CO 2 emissions for the 2\u00a0\u00b0C/1.5\u00a0\u00b0C target, which necessitates using other mitigation technologies of much higher costs. These results may cause concern over the feasibility of achieving the temperature targets, especially for the 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C target, and point to technical and scenario design aspects that will need further research for biomass-based NETs and their allowable expansion speed.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "72bcb92dd320a491800188444d27a167bfed906a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "41786907", "CorpusId": 128225745}, "title": "The landscape of carbon dioxide capture, storage and management (CCSM): Education in the UK", "abstract": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) was established in 1974 within the framework of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to implement an international energy programme.

Because of their abundance and important role in the global carbon cycle, carbonates (inorganic compounds containing the -CO3 moiety) have been studied as possible long-term storage forms for CO2. The conversion of CO2 into solid carbonates via reactions such as: XO + CO2 XCO3 (X=divalent metal) present one such mechanism, but reaction rates with CO2 are exceedingly slow unless additional energy (heat and/or pressure) is introduced. The conversion of metal oxides to hydroxides and subsequent reaction with CO2 has also been considered, but the cost of chemically forming such hydroxides (rare in nature) appear to be prohibitive. Thus, despite their desirability as stable CO2 reservoirs, cost and other factors have proven to be impediments to the formation of solid carbonates as a CO2 capture/ sequestration strategy. However, it has been recognized in the geologic CO2 sequestration field (i.e., subterranean injection of CO2) that certain geochemical conditions can exist where the formation of FeCO3 would be favored and could provide a stable trap for CO2 injected underground. Also, the oxidation of iron metal in the presence of CO2 is well known. This proceeds by the reaction: Fe + 2CO2 + 2H2O Fe + 2HCO3 + \u2191H2 (1) which can further lead to the precipitation of a solid carbonate via pH elevation (e.g., removal of excess CO2): Fe + 2HCO3 \u2193FeCO3(s) + \u2191CO2(g) + H2O. (2) The net reaction is then: Fe + CO2 + H2O \u2193FeCO3(s) + \u2191H2. (3) Given the abundance of Fe in nature (globally, 4 most abundant element) and as a waste metal (US scrap iron production = 10 tones/year, ref. 7), it is worth considering purposeful, aboveground iron carbonate formation as a CO2 sequestration tool. Additionally two valuable by-products can be produced from reaction 1, electricity and hydrogen. Because 2 moles of electrons are transferred per mole of Fe reacted and H2 formed, electricity could be made to flow between a reactive anode (Fe) and a non-reactive cathode (e.g. graphite); the anodic reaction being Fe Fe + 2e and the cathodic reaction being 2CO2 + 2H2O + 2e H2 + 2HCO3. Assuming a conservative Fe reaction rate of 10 moles m s, a cell current density of 1.9 A m is calculated. The cell potential of 0.44V leads to a power generation of 85kW per mole Fe reacted s, or about 421 kWhe per tonne Fe reacted hr. Such energy production is confirmed by voltage and current densities generated in experimental iron corrosion studies (Figure 1). 0.46 0.44 0.42 0.40 0.38 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "5d84b7b103837bde91249b4497976965f26a5d6c", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1093/oxfclm/kgac001", "CorpusId": 248103938}, "title": "Implications of a net-zero target for India\u2019s sectoral energy transitions and climate policy", "abstract": "\n The IPCC 1.5\u2009\u00b0C report highlights the criticality of achieving a net-zero greenhouse gas future.

It turns out that the advantagenousness of CCS investments rise with the CO2 stock. If the gains of CCS, in terms of lower energy costs, outweigh the gains of R&D and capital accumulation, investments are reallocated towards CCS.

Positive CCS investments allow a higher extraction of fossil fuel, which implies lower backstop utilization. Consequently, CCS investments lower the advantageousness of R&D ceteris paribus.

Achieving this goal requires understanding where energy is produced and consumed, the magnitude of CO2 generation, and the Carbon Cycle. Many prior proposed solutions focus on reducing future CO2 emissions from continued use of fossil fuels. Examination of these technologies exposes their limitations and shows that none offer a complete solution. Direct Capture technologies are needed to reduce CO2 already in the air. The best way to permanently remove CO2 already in the atmosphere is to break the Carbon Cycle by growing biomass from atmospheric CO2 and permanently sequestering that biomass carbon in landfills modified to discourage decomposition to CO2 and methane. Tree leaves and switchgrass are proposed as good biomass sources for this purpose. Left unsequestered, leaves decompose with a short Carbon Cycle time constant releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere. Leaves can represent a substantial fraction of the total biomass generated by a tree when integrated over a tree\u2019s lifetime. The cost for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) for growing and sequestering high yield switchgrass is estimated to be lower than CCS for steam reforming of methane hydrogen plants (SRM) and supercritical or combined cycle coal power plants. Thus, sequestration of biomass is a natural, carbon efficient, and low-cost method of Direct Capture.

The reported findings are directly relevant for CO2 sequestration operations as well as enhanced gas and oil recovery technologies (EGR, EOR). The characterisation and core analysis of the core samples to validate the petrophysical properties (Porosity, Permeability) of the core sample was carried out before core flooding using Helium Porosimetry.

It is an ambitious and necessary goal, but is it achievable? An increasing emphasis on clean, renewable energy is essential, as are more efficient ways of using energy. However, the best of intentions will hit an insurmountable roadblock if we continue to burn fossil fuels without deploying Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). CCS is a chain of proven technologies that can take us all the way to a zero-carbon future. For many economies that will be reliant on fossil fuels for several decades, CCS can support a gradual phasing in of renewable energy. CCS remains the only path to deep cuts in carbon emissions from products such as cement, steel and fertiliser - even whisky - and will effectively decarbonise power and heat generation. Deployed on gas or sustainable biomass power, it can plug the gaps in the intermittency of power supply from renewables. And there are many studies that show that the UK and its assets are best placed to deliver CCS for the whole of Europe. Although CCS is already operating in other parts of the world, this climate change technology has had a tough time making progress in the UK. The latest blow came in the last quarter of 2015, within days of the Paris talks. Two major UK CCS projects were poised to begin construction after completing front-end engineering and design (FEED) studies. Without warning, anticipated funding from the UK Government's \u00a31 billion CCS Commercialisation Competition was withdrawn before these studies had been submitted. The Peterhead CCS Project, set to become the world's first CCS project on gas power, and White Rose, which would demonstrate oxyfuel with CCS technology on coal power, have had little choice but to consider closure. In the aftermath of the COP21 climate deal, and with the UK's own climate change advisers restating the importance of the technology in meeting the UK's Fifth Carbon Budget, the case for CCS remains as cogent as ever. In the UK, we have access to an immense CO2 storage asset beneath the North Sea, which could contain a century of Europe's carbon emissions. Added to that is an impressive track record of world-leading research and development (R&D), decades of oil and gas industry knowledge and skills and an infrastructure facing decommissioning that can be repurposed to put carbon back below ground.\n The progress and potential of CCS in the UK is much more than a government competition.

In the policy debate, CCS is advanced as an option in the context of a portfolio of climate change mitigation strategies, such as transition to renewable energy, promotion of energy efficiency and other low-carbon alternatives such as nuclear and hydro. The past two years CCS has increasingly become embedded in the EU\u2019s energy and climate policy-making and in post-2012 climate negotiations, particularly related to the Kyoto Protocol\u2019s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and its future role. Cautioned optimism or skeptical realism reflects dominant perceptions in academic community of CCS: CCS is not the silver bullet to solve the climate problem, but remains a necessary option in a larger portfolio of diverse climate mitigation strategies. Factors that hampers accelerated investment in CCS are the costs barriers coupled with both market and regulatory uncertainty. Objective, methods, results: This objective of this paper is to analyze the prospects and challenges associated with the inclusion of the CCS option under the CDM in a post-Kyoto global bargain (Bode and Jung 2004; Mace et al 2007; Torvanger et al 2005, Vajhala et al 2007). Central research questions are: What is the role of CCS in a post-Kyoto multilateral climate process and how can CCS be an incentive to promote participation of developing countries in UNFCCC/Kyoto process? Can CCS projects contribute to the twin goals of CDM, i.e. cost-effective emission reductions for developed countries and sustainable development for host countries? The issue of allowing CCS projects under CDM in a post-2012 treaty is highly contested. Proponents argue that CCS is a mature technology ready to be deployed to slow carbon emissions where they are most needed, namely in coal-rich growing developing countries, calling for technology transfer. Opponents argue that CCS is an unproven and immature technology and making CCS eligible as CDM projects will make developing countries \u2018guinea pigs\u2019 since issues of storage, leakage, monitoring and liability are largely unresolved in rich industrialized countries (de Coninck 2008). The paper reviews this contested debate and the competing arguments among industry actors, NGOs and developed and developing countries will be mapped. Key methods are participatory observations, argumentative and discourse analysis and archival studies of the negotiation process. The results demonstrate that the heated debate on CCS in post-2012 climate negotiations raises larger debates on risk governance, uncertainty in the employment of large-scale technologies, the role of coal and fossil fuels in future energy production, and burden sharing and equity between the North and the South and current and future generations.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "cb27a0518bf83b4945897f6a1ee167460cf494ed", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 231853460}, "title": "Greater stability of carbon capture in species-rich natural forests compared to species-poor plantations", "abstract": "Tree plantations and forest restoration are leading strategies for enhancing terrestrial carbon (C) sequestration andmitigating climate change.While it is well established that species-rich natural forests offer superior C sequestering benefits relative to short-rotation commercialmonoculture plantations, differences in rates of C capture and storage between longer-lived plantations (commercial or non-commercial) and natural forests remain unclear.

The substrates were loaded into a custom-built CVD apparatus, where CNT growth was initiated by heating the substrates to 750 \u00b0C under the fl ow of He, H2, C2H4 and a controlled amount of water vapor. The resultant CNTs were characterized by a variety of methods including Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the growth parameters were varied in an attempt to optimize the purity and growth yield of the CNTs. The surface area and hydrogen adsorption characteristics of the CNTs were quantifi ed by the BrunauerEmmett-Teller (BET) and Sieverts methods, and their capacitance was measured via cyclic voltammetry. While vertically-aligned CNT growth could not be verifi ed, TEM and SEM analysis indicated that CNT growth was still obtained, resulting in multiwalled CNTs of a wide range in diameter along with some amorphous carbon impurities. These microscopy fi ndings were reinforced by Raman spectroscopy, which resulted in a G/D ratio ranging from 1.5 to 3 across different samples, suggestive of multiwalled CNTs. Changes in gas fl ow rates and water concentration during CNT growth were not found to have a discernable effect on the purity of the CNTs. The specifi c capacitance of a CNT/FeMo/Inconel\u00ae electrode was found to be 3.2 F/g, and the BET surface area of a characteristic CNT sample was measured to be 232 m2/g with a cryogenic (77K) hydrogen storage of 0.85 wt%. This level of hydrogen adsorption is slightly higher than that predicted by the Chahine rule, indicating that these CNTs may bind hydrogen more strongly than other carbonaceous materials. More work is needed to confi rm and determine the reason for increased hydrogen adsorption in these CNTs, and to test them for use as catalyst support networks. This study demonstrates the feasibility of producing CNTs for energy storage applications using water-assisted CVD.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "326574e9d50c1c8e624bd500a070ec89f91c9705", "externalIds": {"MAG": "320221131", "CorpusId": 137643598}, "title": "DEVELOPMENT OF ADSORBENTS FORTHE CAPTURE AND STORAGE OFHYDROGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE BYMAGNETRON SPUTTERING", "abstract": "Concerns about climate change have rejuvenated global efforts in \nreducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.

This study analyzed the economic viability of H2 energy with a focus on the electricity and transport sectors, employing a spatially-disaggregated global energy system model. The simulated period is from 2015 to 2050. The results suggest that, in addition to strict CO2 regulation policies, significant cost reductions of H2 production technologies would be prerequisite to accelerate H2-fueled power generation globally. By contrast, deployment of fuel-cell vehicle appears more sensitive to vehicle price, rather than the H2 supply costs. Among H2 production processes, gasification of coal and reformation of natural gas, combined with carbon capture and storage, are estimated to be cost-efficient, implying opportunities for H2 trade between coal and gas resource countries and energy consumers. Yet, again, improved economics are necessary for maritime H2 transportation, including liquefied H2; otherwise, H2 trade would be limited to pipeline. If maritime H2 trade becomes economically viable, natural gas and coal in Australia could be competitive feedstock for Japan.

In contrast with the elastic modelling, in the poroelastic approach the properties of the pore fluid are taken into account in the algorithm. Poroelastic modelling could be useful in cases where the fluid content of the rock is of interest, i.e. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects. We examined our program using a model based on the Quest CCS project in Alberta to investigate the detectability of CO2 after one year of injection. This was done by defining two models for the baseline and monitor scenarios that represented the subsurface before and after injecting CO2, respectively. The difference between the calculated seismic sections for the two scenarios shows that the residual amplitude is comparable with the signal amplitude. With this result, the injected CO2 in the Quest project over a year could be detected providing the data have good bandwidth and a high signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, a comparison between the poroelastic algorithm and the elastic algorithm shows that the time-lapse effect in the poroelastic case is smaller than the one in the elastic case. In the fluid saturated media some of the wave energy dissipates due to the traveling wave in the fluid and the poroelastic approach helps us to take this loss into account in the modeling process.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "3fbf4f4dc4a3e5041fd89aaf19b4bd8a6ee9471e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3110464704", "DOI": "10.1007/s11053-020-09780-7", "CorpusId": 227067132}, "title": "Numerical Simulation of Effects of Microbial Action on CO2 Geological Storage in Deep Saline Aquifers", "abstract": "CO2 geological storage (CGS) is a crucial strategy for meeting CO2 emission reduction targets. However, the effect of microbial action on CGS in deep saline aquifer is unclear. In this paper, numerical simulations based on previous experimental data were conducted to investigate CO2 solubility-trapping and mineral-trapping by microbial-mediated process in CGS demonstration base in Ordos, north of China. The simulation results reveal that the presence of a microbial community has a positive influence on CGS, mainly in terms of the amount of CO2 that can be injected and the manner by which it is stored. With the effect of microbial action, the amount of injected CO2 was increased by 23.33% and the CO2 mineral sequestration increased from 1.12 to 2.05%. In addition, microbial action plays different roles at different stages of CGS. In the initial stage of CO2 injection, the microbial action promotes dissolution of calcite, oligoclase and clay minerals such as chlorite and kaolinite, providing a favorable condition (more K+, Ca2+, Na+, Mg2+, Fe2+ and HCO3\u2212) for CO2 mineral-trapping. In the following stage of CGS, microbial action accelerates the precipitation of carbon-fixing minerals such as calcite and siderite, enhancing the CO2 storage security in deep saline aquifer. As such, secondary minerals such as ferroan dolomite and dawsonite were observed in advance in microbially mediated CO2\u2013saline\u2013sandstone interactions, further indicating that microbes play a positive role in CO2 mineral-trapping. Consequently, the microbial action can promote mineral capture of CO2 and increase the CO2 storage security in deep saline aquifer. These conclusions can provide a reference and basis for the suitability assessment of CGS in such deep saline aquifer like Erdos, China.", "year": 2020}]}
