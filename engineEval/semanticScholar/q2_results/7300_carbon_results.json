The results suggest that, in addition to strict CO2 regulation policies, significant cost reductions of H2 production technologies would be prerequisite to accelerate H2-fueled power generation globally. By contrast, deployment of fuel-cell vehicle appears more sensitive to vehicle price, rather than the H2 supply costs. Among H2 production processes, gasification of coal and reformation of natural gas, combined with carbon capture and storage, are estimated to be cost-efficient, implying opportunities for H2 trade between coal and gas resource countries and energy consumers. Yet, again, improved economics are necessary for maritime H2 transportation, including liquefied H2; otherwise, H2 trade would be limited to pipeline.

Carbon capture is an important first step in the implementation of such an approach. Despite the significant effort devoted to the development of carbon\u2010capture techniques, their implementation remains challenging due to the high energetic costs, large environmental impacts and rapid degradation of capture materials associated with some of the current processes. Of the many alternatives available for carbon capture, solvent\u2010based absorption is a competitive and mature technology for carbon dioxide removal from gas streams [1, 2]. A solvent can absorb CO2 through two broad mechanisms: chemical absorption and physical absorption. Chemical absorption entails the formation of chemical bonds between solvent molecules and CO2, typically through the formation of ionic species. Physical absorption, on the other hand, is driven by weaker van der Waals forces that promote interactions between the solvent and CO2. Chemical absorption has some advantages over its physical counterpart: chemical solvents usually have a higher capacity for CO2 [3], chemisorption processes can be applied to streams with relatively low CO2 partial pressures, and mass transfer from the gas to the liquid phase may be enhanced due to the depletion of CO2 from the liquid phase caused by the reactions. The thermal regeneration of chemical solvents can, h owever, be highly energy intensive [4], whereas physical solvents can be regenerated simply with a less costly pressure\u2010swing process.

Oxyfuel technology is a process developed to reduce emissions from power stations by removing nitrogen from air and burning the fossil fuels in a stream of pure oxygen. The remaining oxidiser is composed of recycled flue gas from the furnace to reduce temperatures. The product of this system is a flue gas with very high carbon dioxide concentration enabling more efficient capture and storage. Accurate modelling of oxyfuel is essential to gain better understanding of the combustion fundamentals and obtain accurate predictions of properties within the furnace that cannot be measured. Heat transfer to the furnace walls will be affected due to the different composition of the gases in the furnace. Carbon dioxide has higher heat capacity than nitrogen. Water vapour and carbon dioxide also exhibit absorption spectra of radiation in the infra-red region of the spectrum relating to wavelengths observed in combustion. Accurate CFD modelling of radiative heat transfer in oxyfuel combustion will require improvements to the radiative properties model to account for the spectral nature of radiation. In addition the impact of the solid fuel particles, soot and ash are considered. Several different radiative properties models have been tested to assess the impact on the predicted radiation and temperatures under air and oxy firing conditions. The results for radiation transferred to the walls are highly dependent upon the model chosen and the need for an accurate radiative properties model for oxyfuel firing, such as the full-spectrum k-distribution method is demonstrated.Copyright \u00a9 2009 by ASME", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "3d3513fe74d77c381a14118e4eee68e6d6e27d8a", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 18395924}, "title": "Developing a Mechanistic Understanding of Lamellar Hydroxide Mineral Carbonation Reaction Processes to Reduce CO 2 Mineral Sequestration Process Cost", "abstract": "The potential environmental effects of increasing atmospheric CO2 levels are of major worldwide concern.

Unlike many other proposed CO2 sequestration technologies, which provide storage, CO2 mineral sequestration provides permanent disposal via geologically stable mineral carbonates (e.g., MgCO3). As such, mineral sequestration guarantees permanent containment and avoids adverse environmental consequences and the cost of continuous site monitoring.

The drawback, however, is that the modern methods of hydrogen production require significant amounts of energy and generate large volumes of CO2. The most common way of producing hydrogen today is a staged process including natural hydrocarbon gas production, its transport and processing, steam reforming and storage, followed by further transport and management of by-products such as CO2. A process allowing for generating hydrogen from hydrocarbons in situ could open a new immense source of clean hydrogen energy for commercial use. In the proposed novel concept the hydrogen generation process is carried out directly in the hydrocarbon reservoir. The reservoir is then converted into a ready to produce high pressure hydrogen storage cell. Hydrocarbon processing and transportation stages on the surface are therefore abated. The energy required for hydrogen production is significantly reduced with CO2 being captured and stored in-situ. In the \u201cconventional\u201d process capturing and storing CO2 from a power plant alone can increase the energy cost by up to 60%. In addition to energy saving the emissions of green house gases is wed out. In order to validate the concept of in situ hydrogen generation process several laboratory experiments were performed. The CO2 flooding experiments in the sandstone core at reservoir conditions indicated gravitational segregation of CO2 in the methane-carbon dioxide system. The hydrogen conversion experiment demonstrated feasibility of the suggested process. Catalytic experiments without optimising reaction conditions showed that resulted gas compositions can contain up to 55% of hydrogen. Thermodynamic calculations using experimental data allowed to evaluate relative importance of the reactions that may take place at given conditions. For the in-situ process a water soluble precursor can be placed in the reservoir using dedicated injection wells. Steam reforming temperatures may be reached with either steam injection or in-situ combustion resulting in required increase of reservoir temperatures. High thermal energy generated in situ may be utilised later by temporally using the injection wells as geothermal ones. Circulating water into these wells will allow to bring this thermal energy to the surface and to reduce the temperature in the reservoir. Reduction of the reservoir temperature from steam-vapour condition at hydrogen generation stage to conditions corresponding to condensation of water will have positive effect for separation of hydrogen in situ and CO2 dissolution in water. CO2 solubility in water is almost 700 times higher than solubility of H2. At cooler temperatures gravity segregation will effectively contribute to hydrogen segregation and accumulation of it in the upper parts of the geological structure.

A number of algorithms have been introduced into this area for analysis and prediction on the time series, such as classification, clustering, segmentation, indexing and discovering rules from historical time series. However, financial time series data is characterized as large in data size, dynamic and non-linear. Therefore it poses a great challenge for analysts to efficiently discover required information. As for data mining tasks, most of the execution time spent by algorithm is to move data from disk into main memory. This is acknowledged as the major bottleneck in Data Mining because many algorithms require multiple accesses of the data. Moreover, when analyzing or predicting the movement of time series, financial analysts usually capture the trends, shapes or patterns contained within the time series instead of the exact value of each time series data point. Thus time series representation on dimensionality reduction becomes the necessary step before mining information in this area. In this thesis we study the property of the maximum or minimum points on the time series, which have the property of maintaining the trends and fluctuations of the time series. These points are called turning points in our thesis. However, not all turning points from the original time series equally contribute to the overall movement of the time series. Thus we introduce three independent methods with different perspectives to select turning points for approximating time series with dimensionality reduction. The first method is to detect turning points at different levels of details based on the heuristics. This approach is extremely useful for analyzing stock data in top-down fashion. The second method is to select turning points based on a sliding window. The third method is to select turning points based on the degree of importance. The importance of a turning point is calculated according to its contribution on preserving the time series trends and shape. These turning points with different importance are stored in an optimal binary search tree. Such storage scheme allows more important points to be retrieved first while the average search cost is kept at minimum.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "b9f93cb4b9251f37702e25606a3c185e272ea215", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "8246700", "DOI": "10.1021/acsomega.1c02138", "CorpusId": 235755944, "PubMed": "34235337"}, "title": "Comparative Study: Impacts of Ca and Mg Salts on Iron Oxygen Carriers in Chemical Looping Combustion of Biomass", "abstract": "Chemical looping combustion (CLC) is one of the most promising methods for carbon capture and storage (CCS). An oxygen carrier, i.e., a mineral that can be oxidized and reduced, is used to convert the fuel in the process. The produced CO2 is inherently separated from the air components that enables easier CCS. The use of biomass-based fuels is desirable since it can lead to negative CO2 emissions. On the other hand, alkali compounds from the biomass may interact with the oxygen carrier causing problems, such as deactivation of the oxygen carrier. The most common oxygen carriers contain iron, since iron-based ores and industrial waste materials are readily available and cost-efficient. Therefore, the interaction between the iron oxygen carriers and the biomass ash-forming compounds needs to be investigated. Since Ca/Mg are abundant in biomass, it is important to clarify how their compounds interact with the oxygen carrier. In this study, the effect of Ca/Mg carbonates, chlorides, nitrates, sulfates, and phosphates along with synthetic biomass-derived ash on iron oxides was investigated. Redox reactions were investigated at 950 \u00b0C during 5 h under both oxidizing and reducing atmospheres. The results showed that the effect of Ca/Mg salts on the oxygen carrier varied depending on the anion of the salt. Generally, the nitrate- and phosphate-based salts of both Ca and Mg showed the harshest effect regarding agglomeration of the oxygen carriers. It was shown that the Ca/Mg-based compounds interacted differently with iron oxides, which was an unexpected result.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "196cae18ce7be3c8e0c54ae4cff733c9f28d67ee", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1088/1755-1315/784/1/012021", "CorpusId": 235290205}, "title": "Carbon storage technologies applied to rethinking building construction and carbon emissions", "abstract": "This study has been conducted to offer an insight into the prospect of the building industry decarbonization.

This has serious impact on CO2 transport, especially across jurisdictions. It also impacts the administration of storage systems for CCS facilities. Regulations focusing primarily on technical aspects of CCS including capture, transport, and liability predominate while there are less regulatory provisions for the financial aspects of CCS technology as well as public engagement and support. While capital grants and emission and tax credits are the predominant financial issues covered in regulations, contract for differences, streamlining emission trading across borders and enhancing cooperation and multilevel engagement in CCS warrant more attention. \nOriginality / value of the article: Many scenarios to maintain global warming below 2 degrees Celsius require combinations of new technology including CCS.

CCS wells require special design considerations to ensure long-term zonal isolation when exposed to carbon dioxide (CO2) because a complex set of chemical reactions leads to carbonation and dissolution of conventional cement sheaths.\n Several studies conducted into the long-term stability of different cement systems when exposed to wet supercritical CO2 and CO2-saturated water showed that the novel CO2- resistant cement system provides enduring zonal isolation. Properties investigated included permeability, porosity, mass evolution, CO2 degradation front, and compressive strength. Given its superior mechanical properties, the novel CO2-resistant cement system was selected for use in the first Australian offshore CCS Gular-1 appraisal well.\n To ensure that the blend characteristics of the novel CO2-resistant cement system remained optimal, a stringent quality-control procedure was developed. The blend management process, supported by rigorous laboratory testing, covered the complete lifecycle of the blend. This lifecycle extended from sourcing chemical components, to blending the components in a bulk plant, to transporting the blend across land and sea, and ultimately, preparing the slurry mixing.\n By adhering to the project management process, all primary cement jobs were successfully performed without incident using conventional cementing equipment and practices. The novel approach of blending the product locally at a fit-for-purpose facility reduced costs compared with previous methods of importing a preblended product prepared at a special centralized facility. Blend homogeneity was maintained during transfer from a sea vessel to the jackup rig, with minimal change in density between samples received from the bulk plant and samples received from the rig. This blending, which verified the initial blend flow capability and the robustness tests performed at a regional laboratory using specialized equipment, concluded the blend is suitable for offshore operations.\n Selection of a suitable cement system to ensure long-term zonal isolation will prove essential to the continuing expansion of the CO2 injection market. Through this offshore CCS appraisal project, valuable best practices and lessons learned in design and execution have been captured. This paper presents the decision process used for selecting a suitable CO2-resistant cement system for Australia's first offshore CCS appraisal well, drilled by AGR as part of the CarbonNet Project in late 2019, as well as the project management processes implemented to ensure successful job execution.

While they operate at near full capacity during the peak summer demand months, during months of lower demand, the power output follows regular daily and seasonal patterns. In designing a pipeline to connect multiple CO2 sources and sinks, some of these short duration fluctuations can be tolerated by the storage capacity in the pipeline network itself. For those fluctuations that cannot be absorbed in the pipeline, the CO2 injection design may need to be altered accordingly. Power generation data from the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) is used to estimate CO2 capture from an existing coal power plant. This paper estimates the cost trends associated with handling CO2 input fluctuations relative to a nominal constant CO2 output via (1) pipeline size for storage capacity and (2) number of injection wells to store efficiently CO2 with a fluctuating flow rate. The design of such a CO2 injection facility depends on certain geologic characteristics including porosity, permeability, relative permeability, and fluid saturations. It is assumed that a deep saline aquifer will accompany an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operation, known as a stacked storage system. The Conroe Field in Montgomery County, Texas, is used as a model for such an operation. Conroe Field is an old oil reservoir that initially had 1.45 billion barrels of oil and permeability ranging from 0.5-2.0 darcies. These characteristics would be very desirable for developing a stacked storage project. To optimize production from EOR, the injection rate flexibility is minimal. Thus, in a \u201cstacked storage\u201d system, a potential EOR operation will be considered from an economic basis, where revenue is recovered from additional oil production. In such an operation, a deep saline formation can handle the fluctuations associated with carbon capture systems at a power plant. During the years of maximum EOR production from the Conroe Field, injection into a deep saline aquifer would be only to handle periods of peak load from the coal plant and daily or seasonal fluctuations from the average CO2 captured.

The comparison is performed for selected locations in the Northeastern United States over a 30\u2010year production timeline and 100 observation years.

But at present CCS is very expensive and its performance is highly uncertain at the scale of commercial power plants. Such challenges to deployment, though, are not new to students of technological change. Several successful technologies, including energy technologies, have faced similar challenges as CCS faces now. In this paper we draw lessons for the CCS industry from the history of other energy technologies that, as with CCS today, were risky and expensive early in their commercial development. Specifically, we analyze the development of the US nuclear-power industry, the US SO2-scrubber industry, and the global LNG industry. We focus on three major questions in the development of these analogous industries. First, we consider the creation of the initial market to prove the technology: how and by whom was the initial niche market for these industries created? Second, we look at how risk-reduction strategies for path-breaking projects allowed the technology to evolve into a form so that it could capture a wider market and diffuse broadly into service. Third, we explore the \"learning curves\" that describe the cost reduction as these technologies started to capture significant market share. Our findings suggest that directly applying to CCS the conventional wisdom that is prevalent regarding the deployment and diffusion of technologies can be very misleading. The conventional wisdom may be summarized as: \"Technologies are best deployed if left in the hands of private players\"; \"Don't pick technology winners\" or \"Technology forcing is wrong\"; and \"Technology costs reduce as its cumulative installed capacity increases\".

One of the relatively novel technologies aimed at CO2 capture is based on cryogenic removal of CO2. Cryogenic CO2 capture is integrated with the oxy-fuel combustion process to separate CO2 from the flue gas in large power sources. The aim of this study is to model and evaluate the cryogenic capture of CO2 from the flue gas with minimum energy requirements for the process followed by oxy-fuel combustion at power generation point sources.

However, CCS is an energy intensive process, and demands additional energy, chemicals and infrastructure. The capture processes may also have certain direct emissions to air (NH3, aldehydes, solvent vapor etc.) and generate solid wastes from degradation byproducts. A trade-off in environmental impacts is expected, and with the large-scale application of CCS needed to make any significant reduction in CO emissions, these potential trade-offs can become enormous in magnitude. Therefore a systematic process of evaluation of complete life cycle for all available CCS options and large-scale CCS deployment scenarios is needed.

The results of the study shows that the CCS systems achieve significant reduction in global warming impact but have multiple environmental trade-offs depending on the technology. These trade-offs are mainly due to energy penalty from capture process, infrastructure development and waste treatment processes. Damage assessment shows that the CCS systems greatly reduce human health damage and ecosystem damage by mitigating the climate change impact while increasing the resource consumption. Scenario assessment results show the clear advantage of global CCS integration scenarios over the Baseline scenario having significantly lower impact potential scores for all impact and damage categories from fossil-based electricity production.

The Otway facility has one of world\u2019s most comprehensive characterisation, injection, monitoring and verification programs, and its successful project outcomes have not only met and helped further guide CCS legislation within Australia, but also assisted underpinning the regulatory and business case for large commercial CCS projects in Australia and overseas. In addition, the Otway Capture Facility is a hub for CO2 capture research for high pressure and high CO2 content natural gases. Tests are being conducted using adsorption and three different types of membrane-based gas separation technologies. These technologies have the potential to become available for natural gas processing on production platforms and floating production storage and offloading vessels.\n", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "b744f461f83ffec64c7c54710f15f1f6c5291ed5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2911380533", "CorpusId": 134012565}, "title": "The influence of carbon storage and biomass potentials in the future development of Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "80564f799052d4bcff247c7162c0ca4ea3becd4e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2347357121", "CorpusId": 156680449}, "title": "The development road of low-carbon economy with Chinese characteristics", "abstract": "With the development of the world economy, the energy demand will retain increasing and carbon dioxide emission will also keep a high growth rate.

This is known as carbon capture and storage (CCS). CO2 captured from power plants is transported to these reservoirs using pipelines. To determine the parameters of pipeline operation this calls for a need to characterise, via an \"equation of state\", the physical properties of CO2 during transport. Doing so is further complicated by the fact that CO2 captured from power stations is typically a mixture of CO2 with other fluids. This affects the physical properties of the CO2 to be transported and so needs to be accounted for. \n \nIn this thesis we develop statistical models for equations of state that can account for the physical properties of CO2 relevant to carbon capture and storage, and which allow us to quantify uncertainty in the predictions from the equation of state. We propose two statistical models for equations of state. Firstly we develop a statistical model which can be applied to any pressure-explicit parametric equation of state. To do so we have developed a novel method by which to rigorously account for uncertainties due to coexistence which is complicated by the fact that it involves perfectly correlated measurements on two fluid phases. We fit this model to pure CO2 obtaining good agreement with data for most temperatures. We then extended this model and our method for accounting for coexistence to mixtures. We fit this model to real CO2-H2 data. Despite mixing well, the results of this fit do not agree well with the data and equations of state need to be developed further to be able to model mixture data well. \n \nSecondly we develop a non-parametric Gaussian process approach which offers greater flexibility and requires fewer assumptions. This non-parametric model is fit to pure CO2 reference data for individual subcritical temperatures. We demonstrate how applying a transformation to the covariance function can account for non-stationarity in the data resulting in good agreement between predictions from the fit model and the data.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "b781a15842a50288da44011589aa42fe1f572428", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3007026295", "DOI": "10.5614/jtki.2013.12.1.1", "CorpusId": 217188221}, "title": "Simulasi difusi dan adsorpsi matriks pada proses enhanced coalbed methane", "abstract": "Diffusion and matrix adsorption simulations in enhanced coalbed methane process.

The industrially relevant fuels selected were analysed to determine their fundamental composition and combusted in air and a range of oxy-fuel environments (5-30% O2/CO2) using a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA). The key temperatures and kinetic parameters of both the devolatilisation and char combustion stages were investigated to determine how the shift to an oxy-fuel combustion environment effects overall combustion behaviour. \nThe changes in devolatilisation behaviour were determined through the derivation of apparent first order kinetics and no noticeable difference between combustion in air and 21% O2/CO2 atmospheres were observed. The increase in oxygen concentration in the oxy-fuel environments resulted in linear increases in kinetic parameters which were then used to develop fuel specific empirical equations that relate the devolatilisation rate to the oxygen concentration. The devolatilisation of the biomass fuels were shown to be more sensitive to the change in combustion atmosphere than the coals. \nChars were produced using ballistic heating rates in a TGA (1000 K min-1) and it was found that the coals exhibited similar mass loss behaviour in N2 and CO2 environments during char production. The biomass and torrefied biomass samples showed enhanced devolatilisation in CO2 atmospheres which leads to differences in the char combustion behaviour between the coal and biomass fuels. The char combustion behaviour was determined through the determination of apparent mth order kinetics, from which, fuel specific nth order kinetic models were derived to describe char combustion accurately over the full range of oxy-fuel combustion atmospheres. The kinetic parameters determined highlighted the similarity between the N2 and CO2 produced coal chars and the difference between the biomass chars. The coal chars were found to be more sensitive to the change in combustion atmosphere. \nThe work in this thesis gives a good understanding of the differences between conventional air and oxy-fuel combustion atmospheres using industrially relevant fuels.

The CO2 is captured from industrial and energy-related sources to keep the CO2 out of the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration is one of a portfolio of CO2 emission mitigation technologies that may be used to reduce carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Unlike new technologies being developed, or technologies that require time to build capacity such as wind power, carbon sequestration can be implemented now at sources with high-purity CO2 streams. With CCS, CO2 generated at large industrial sources like ethanol plants, factories, or power plants is captured instead of being released into the atmosphere. Then, the captured CO2 is compressed into a dense, low-viscosity fluid and transported to a suitable location where it is injected into a deep geologic system to be permanently sequestered. A geologic sequestration (GS) system, ideally, consists of at least four different geologic formations responsible for holding and keeping the CO2 deep in the earth. These are a storage formation, a primary caprock, a monitoring formation, and a secondary caprock (Figure 1). The storage formation where the CO2 is sequestered must have properties that allow the CO2 to be injected and space for it to remain stored. It is important that the storage formation is not a mineral-bearing formation and is not an underground source of drinking water (USDW). The primary caprock is directly above the storage formation and its properties do not allow the CO2 to pass through it, so the CO2 remains trapped in the storage formation. The secondary cap rock must be above the primary cap rock and below the deepest source of drinking water. The secondary cap rock acts as a backup in case CO2 gets through the primary cap rock.

These differences include much longer regulatory lifetimes, increasing pressure over well lifetimes, inherently corrosive environment, intermittent operation and large variation of CO2 injection stream properties depending on its impurities. These differences require a different approach to well design for CCS projects. A well design philosophy, which has been developed to address these differences, is presented. The paper outlines the material selection guidelines and tubular load cases. The design philosophy, material guidelines and load cases are illustrated through several example well designs.\n For CCS wells, the design should start with the completion size required to achieve the desired CO2 injection rate, and progress outwards. Dual containment is essential; the second barrier must not only be designed for the corrosive environment, but the second barrier and its associated equipment must be periodically inspected or tested. All CCS wells, including injection, monitoring and utility wells, must be designed for potential CO2 exposure. Highest loads may be imposed during transient or upset operations, and may originate from changing thermal conditions. Cement integrity is essential to prevent undetected migration of stored CO2 out of the storage zones.

Various capture techniques have been developed for capturing CO2 from post combustion emission. One of the new approaches considered for capturing CO2 and hence reducing to atmospheric emissions is based on gas hydrate (crystallization) technology. The basis of the technology is the selective partition of the target component between the hydrate phase and the gaseous phase. It is expected that CO2 is preferentially trapped and encaged into the hydrate crystal phase compared to the other components. Previous study found that the gas/hydrate equilibrium pressure and temperature for the fl ue gas mixture in the range of 7.6 MPa and 11.0 MPa at 274 K and 277 K respectively, are inappropriate to the downstream oil and gas industrial reality because the operating cost will be expensive to compress the gas to the hydrate formation pressure. Suitable hydrate promoters including Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) can be used to achieve moderate hydrate formation pressure and energy consumption appropriate to the industrial reality. In the presence of THF and SDS about 62.3 Nm3/m3 CO2 hydrate can be formed at 30 bar pressure and 274 to 277 K temperature within around 15 minutes reaction time.Many experiments result indicates that continuous hydrates formation will be feasible for scale-up to industrial settings including downstream oil and gas industry emission reduction if the technology assures an optimal contact between gas and liquid phases plus the proper hydrate promoter.

While coal proponents point to supply security, low cost and jobs, environmentalists fear the destruction of landscapes, a threat to the earth\u2019s climate, and a massive delay for a sustainable restructuring of the energy system. Debates now gain momentum again in face of the massive investment needs in the German electricity industry (until 2020, about 40 GWel of capacity need replacement). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an innovation that promises the low emissions coal power station. Unfortunately, the technology is still under development. It is not at all clear when and at which cost it will be ready for the market. Its economic viability and core environmental and safety issues remain unsolved. Even in this stadium, CCS may provide new avenues for future electricity generation that mix up traditional conflict lines, generating new chances for consensus, but also new areas of concern and potential disagreement. Such changes may influence the acceptability and viability of policy options with regard to future coal use. Starting from this hypothesis, the paper analyses the viewpoints and strategies of major political and economic actors towards CCS and the future of coal in the German electricity system. Also considering actors\u2019 resources and networks, it portrays the actor constellation and tries to determine potential changes caused by CCS. It argues that, as CCS is still an emerging technology, viewpoints and strategies are characterized by many uncertainties at the moment. Actors are still trying to learn about CCS and form their opinion. This opens up space for dialogue and moderates confrontation. A possible policy option that may result is the use of coal with CCS as a bridging technology towards a sustainable or even fully renewable energy future.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "297611fefe343634c6463968c9be9e3be7d7823c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2922299914", "DOI": "10.1002/GHG.1671", "CorpusId": 131894514}, "title": "Sensitivity of seismic response for monitoring CO 2 storage in a low porosity reservoir of the St Lawrence Lowlands, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada: Part 1 \u2013 Laboratory measurements", "abstract": "Deployment of carbon capture and storage on a large scale poses many challenges.

Global warming is caused mainly by carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. Solution that can be applied quickly and on a large scale is to use Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology. This technology is a series of activities starting from CO2 capture of the sources of CO2 emissions (source), and then transport it to the storage of CO2 in suitable geological sink locations (sink). In the CCS process, matching between sources and sinks often face many obstacles, such as capacity limits, location, injection flow rate, and availability time from sources and sinks that available. \nThese problems can be solved by a method, that is pinch method. A problem with CCS may occur when the source and sink located in one adjacent area (single region), so it is possible that the CCS process can occur in a multi region where the source and sink locations are far and with many regions. The development of multi region study was conducted in this study, with boundaries area of South Sumatra and East Java with a total of 5 sources and 6 sinks. The development was done by mass transfer simultaneously multi region pinch method and modified and optimized with time interval (\u0394t) 0, 5, 10 based on TAC. \nThe result of this research is obtained by the pinch method of sequencial mass transfer produced % capturable CO2 at the most at time interval 0 years equal to 93,86 % than mass transfer simultaneously method with % capturable CO2 83,94 %. The most efficient cost is found in mass transfer simultaneously pinch method with time interval (\u0394t) of 4.6 years at a cost of Rp 2.15 trillion than sequencial mass transfer method with time interval (\u0394t) of 4.5 years at a cost Rp 2.25 trillion.

This makes it difficult to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) consequences of different forest management or manufacturing activities that maintain the storage of carbon. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) addresses this issue by allowing other accounting methods. The objective of this paper is to provide a new model for estimating annual stock changes of carbon in harvested wood products (HWP).ResultsThe model, British Columbia Harvested Wood Products version 1 (BC-HWPv1), estimates carbon stocks and fluxes for wood harvested in BC from 1965 to 2065, based on new parameters on local manufacturing, updated and new information for North America on consumption and disposal of wood and paper products, and updated parameters on methane management at landfills in the USA. Based on model results, reporting on emissions as they occur would substantially lower BC\u2019s greenhouse gas inventory in 2010 from 48 Mt CO2 to 26 Mt CO2 because of the long-term forest carbon storage in-use and in the non-degradable material in landfills.
