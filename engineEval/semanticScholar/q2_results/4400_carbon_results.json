Thus, it is increasingly being suggested that CO2 capture will be a requirement for continued use of coal for electricity generation in coming decades. For example, within Europe, it has been proposed that CO2 capture could be mandatory for all new coal-fired power plants from 2020 (Commission of the European Communities, 2007). A number of site-specific considerations can be expected to shape technology choice and other decisions related to investments in new coal-fired power plant. These include restrictions in the coal available at reasonable cost, local environmental legislation and the electricity market that the plant would operate in. This paper outlines some considerations for investors, utilities and possibly regulators when identifying sites and making technology choices for new coal-fired plants which are expected to use CO2 capture, either from the outset or following later retrofit (i.e. the initial plant would be capture-ready). It identifies some extra factors in selecting appropriate sites, when compared to plants built without CO2 capture considerations, and outlines some potential 'show-stoppers'. For example, CO2 capture plants must be sited in locations which allow CO 2 to be transported to safe geological storage (or other use). These new factors must ultimately feed into investment decisions. An initial discussion of approaches which could be used by investors and other stakeholders to compare specific technology options is included here. It is important that methods that allow investors and legislators to make informed choices, taking into account site-specific factors which are often neglected in general comparisons of technology, are identified and developed. The qualitative discussion in this paper is intended to inform the quantitative analyses that will be used by project developers in the next few years to select power plant technology options for capture-ready plants and for plants built from the outset with full-scale CO2 capture as part of integrated carbon capture and storage schemes.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "3153e57d485e5ab798ebcfc91ada17a5bd34061a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2901834204", "DOI": "10.1038/s41563-018-0229-8", "CorpusId": 53722086, "PubMed": "30470834"}, "title": "Unrealistic techno-optimism is holding back progress on resource efficiency", "abstract": "To the Editor \u2014 The recent rate of growth in publications on resource efficiency1\u20134 seems to be matched only by the rate at which our use of materials keeps growing: political interest in discussing the topic is not translating to meaningful action. Yet resource efficiency matters. It does not matter because we are running out of key resources \u2014 critical minerals become \u2018critical\u2019 due to a short-term misalignment of supply and demand that can be resolved following investment or political realignment. But it does matter because of climate change. Already, most industrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which contribute a third of the world\u2019s non-agricultural emissions, arise in the extraction and production of bulk materials5. However, as our response to resource shortages is to use more energy \u2014 whether in desalinating and moving water, processing lower grade ores or in more intensive agriculture \u2014 and as, on a global scale, most energy comes from fossil fuels, this response acts to accelerate climate change. Figure 1 illustrates the flow of resources from mine to use and its consequences for industrial energy and emissions. Political and corporate rhetoric about delivering resource efficiency is primarily focused on the four comfortable options in the upper half of the figure that apparently allow economic growth to continue unhindered by the environmental inconvenience of climate change. However, these techno-optimistic options cannot deliver rapidly enough and at sufficient scale to provide the levels of mitigation agreed by national laws and international declarations. Reviewing the four options in turn, we currently produce ~1,500 Mt yr\u20131 of steel and ~4,200 Mt yr\u20131 of cement and there are no plausible substitutes available at this scale (option 1). Global competition for biomass excludes the replacement of steel with timber and stone does not deliver the advantages of concrete. Substituting gas for coal (option 2) reduces electricity emissions by 50% but renewable generation scales badly as it must be deployed over massive areas6. Furthermore, deployment rates for renewables are constrained by legal, contracting and infrastructural issues. For example, the maximum rate at which new renewable generation has been added to the UK grid (expansion of wind and solar power from 2003\u20132016) is 0.5 GW yr\u20131 against a total UK power requirement (across all energy sources) of around 260 GW (ref. 7). Carbon capture and storage or utilization (option 3) has long been hailed as the technology to allow continued use of fossil fuels without emissions, yet total global capacity (meaning the potential for storage, not actual storage) is currently 37 MtCO2e yr\u20131 (ref. 8) against total anthropogenic emissions of ~50,000 MtCO2e yr\u20131. Finally, recycling end-of-life materials in a \u2018circular economy\u2019 (option 4) receives powerful marketing attention. However, as shown in Table 1, only a few materials can be recycled. Doing so remains energy intensive and currently leads to downgrading of material quality. The dream that new technologies will eliminate the harms of climate change is infinitely seductive, and conforms with existing political, economic, commercial and innovation models, but the dream cannot be realized. Technical development in these areas may in future allow demand to expand within environmentally acceptable limits. However, we cannot constrain the total atmospheric stock of greenhouse gases to what are predicted to be safe levels9 by deploying new technologies because they cannot have a large enough effect rapidly enough. The implementation of resource efficiency must therefore be about the efficient use of material resources and not their manner of production. The lower half of Fig. 1 illustrates that today\u2019s demand for services from our stock of resource-intensive capital goods could, in reality, be delivered with a greatly reduced annual production of new materials without requiring significant technical innovation.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "4c0a68ca6826ff0f05e58933ec4210fb0ee13b64", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2741267895", "CorpusId": 135431296}, "title": "Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration: Storage Safety and Security", "abstract": "Answers to common questions about the safety and security of carbon capture and sequestration.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "a5f7ab610237d9808a2596f3b358608f4cd38b2e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2909595967", "DOI": "10.4095/261679", "CorpusId": 134257750}, "title": "Demonstrating carbon capture and storage in Canada", "abstract": null, "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "f602d96a18a639d152484261a7f4a7ad841f8b12", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2941460855", "DOI": "10.1179/174892406X177248", "CorpusId": 92451638}, "title": "Materials challenges in CO2 capture and storage", "abstract": "Abstract To achieve deep reductions in CO2 emission from power generation, technologies for CO2 capture and storage are required to complement other approaches such as improved fuel use efficiency, the switch to low carbon fuels, and the use of renewable and nuclear energy. Three main options currently exist for CO2 capture: removal of CO2 from the flue gas; removal of carbon from the fuel before combustion; and oxyfuel combustion systems that have CO2 and water, which can be separated by condensation, as principal combustion products. On the transport and storage side, the materials issues arise from corrosion and may be solved by drying and purification of the CO2 stream. On the capture side, there are few specific issues regarding the materials used in technologies such as chemical absorption of CO2 in an appropriate solvent (usually amines). The high temperature membranes used to separate oxygen from nitrogen in oxyfuel combustion systems raise materials issues in relation to ionic conduction, thermal and mechanical stability and lifetime when integrated in boilers, fluidised beds and gas turbine systems. The performance of systems integrating ceramic oxygen separating membranes is largely dependant on operating temperature, so the behaviour of these materials at ever higher temperatures is a real technical challenge. Membranes can also be used instead of chemical absorption for the separation of CO2 and hydrogen in fuel de-carbonisation.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "cc51b869a65a70db9cd3db8a8998f032a8a1a070", "externalIds": {"MAG": "83804597", "CorpusId": 150576917}, "title": "A bridge to a low carbon future?

Such a scenario results in a large uptake in the production and consumption of all fossil fuels, with coal in particular dominating the electricity system. It is unconventional sources of gas production that account for much of the rise in natural gas production; with shale gas exceeding 1 Tcm after 2040. Gas consumption grows in all sectors apart from the electricity sector, and eventually becomes cost effective both as a marine fuel (as liquefied natural gas) and in medium goods vehicles (as compressed natural gas). \n \nIt next examines how different gas market structures affect natural gas production, consumption, and trade patterns. For the two different scenarios constructed, one continued current regionalised gas markets, which are characterised by very different prices in different regions with these prices often based on oil indexation, while the other allowed a global gas price to form based on gas supply-demand fundamentals. It finds only a small change in overall global gas production levels between these but a major difference in levels of gas trade and so conclude that if gas exporters choose to defend oil indexation in the short-term, they may end up destroying their export markets in longer term. A move towards pricing gas internationally, based on supply-demand dynamics, is thus shown to be crucial if the if they are to maintain their current levels of exports. \n \nNevertheless, it is also shown that, regardless of how gas is priced in the future, scenarios leading to a 2oC temperature rise generally have larger pipeline and LNG exports than scenarios that lead to a higher temperature increase. For pipeline trade, the adoption of any ambitious emissions reduction agreement results in little \nloss of markets and could (if carbon capture and storage is available) actually lead to a much greater level of exports. For LNG trade, because of the significant role that gas can play in replacing future coal demand in the emerging economies in Asia, markets that are largely supplied by LNG at present, we demonstrate that export countries should actively pursue an ambitious global agreement on GHG emissions mitigation if they want to expand their exports. These results thus have important implications for the negotiating positions of gas-exporting countries in the ongoing discussions on agreeing an ambitious global agreement on emissions reduction.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "c2a9381e4fb9cb37c164c11750bd79110b8f8679", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2146370694", "CorpusId": 147702668}, "title": "On general versus emission saving R&D support", "abstract": "We analyse welfare effects of supporting general versus emission saving technological development when carbon emissions are regulated by a carbon tax.

Geologic structures, notably faults and the damage zones surrounding them may provide a conduit for CO2 to escape through a cap. If the fault encounters shallower permeable formations, the CO2 rising along the fault can enter them. This lateral migration would attenuate the rate at which CO2 enters sensitive formations such as aquifers used for drinking water. Thus, CO2 leakage along faults will have three behaviors: upward migration from the storage formation along a fault, lateral movement from the fault into permeable layers, and a continued but attenuated CO2 flux along the fault above the layers. Here we develop a quasi-1D single-phase flow model for these three behaviors. The model is highly simplified and intended to be suitable for inclusion in a certification framework for geologic storage projects. The model accounts for flow from the fault into a permeable formation using a leakoff coefficient. The coefficient can vary spatially and depends on the geometry and petrophysical properties of the formation. We apply a commercial simulator to verify the quasi-1D model. A series of examples illustrates the controlling mechanisms for leakage rate from the reservoir and its attenuation by flux into shallower layers. Nonlinearities arise even in this simple model. For example, leakage flux and the degree of attenuation vary nonlinearly with the permeability of the fault and the permeability of the shallower layer(s) intersected by the fault. Layers nearest the CO2 storage formation produce the most attenuation. But the percentage of CO2 entering overlying formations from the fault varies linearly with the ratio of fault permeability to leakoff coefficient. A simple estimate of the leak-off coefficient compares favorably with 2D, full-physics simulations. If the permeable layer is dipping, CO2 enters it asymmetrically and estimating the leakoff coefficient is less straightforward. The difference arises because of preferential flow within the layer (CO2 in the upper part, water below). Introduction If society elects to reduce anthropogenic emissions of CO2, geologic storage will be one of the key technologies for achieving this goal. In the standard approach to storage, CO2 is captured from fixed sources such as coal-fired power plants, compressed and injected at supercritical conditions into a suitable target formation. For typical geothermal gradients, suitable formations are found at depths of 800 m (2600 ft) or more, as their temperatures and pressures will be above the critical point of CO2. Trapping the injected CO2 involves one or more mechanisms (Bachu et al. 1994; IPCC 2006): (1) permeability trapping by an impervious confining layer or cap rock; (2) solubility trapping by CO2 dissolution into the aqueous phase in the pore space; (3) mineralogic trapping by chemical reaction of cations with dissolved CO2 to precipitate carbonate minerals; (4) residual phase trapping as the nonwetting CO2 phase becomes disconnected in pores or small clusters of pores; (5) stratigraphic trapping below a formation whose capillary entry pressure is greater than the capillary pressure of the CO2 phase. An intact confining layer is necessary for several trapping mechanisms. However, sedimentary basins often contain geological discontinuities which are potential pathways for leakage through the confining layer. Faults are one such discontinuity and are prevalent in many regions where CO2 storage is likely to be implemented. Wells are a man-made discontinuity, likewise prevalent in likely storage regions. We do not treat them here, but the conceptual model for faults provides a foundation for assessing leakage along wells (Huerta et al. 2008). It is therefore important to examine the consequences if injected CO2 encounters a fault. Figure 1 illustrates the situation of interest. A conductive fault can be a major pathway for the CO2 plume due to its large transfer capacity. However CO2 leaking from the main target formation does not necessarily reach the Earth\u2019s surface. It may not even reach shallower formations of economic interest (mines, hydrocarbon reservoirs, aquifers that serve as underground sources of drinking water (USDW)). Instead, the rising CO2 can be secondarily trapped by shallow subsurface structures, dissolution and residual phase creation (Lindeberg 1997). It can also migrate into permeable formations encountered by the conductive fault. On one hand, this migration attenuates the upward flux. On the other, it spreads the influence of the CO2 across a wider area. The near-surface zone can also attenuate CO2 leaks and decrease CO2 concentration reaching the surface. The attenuation rate is sensitive to the subsurface properties (Oldenburg and Unger 2003). Thus, the effect of a conductive fault on net CO2 storage needs to be analyzed based on the geometric and petrophysical properties of the formation, of the fault and of the overlying permeable layer, and on the boundary conditions (pressure in the storage formation and in the overlying layers). The physics of a CO2 plume rising long vertical distances through the Earth\u2019s crust can be complex (Pruess 2003). Here we present a highly simplified model, motivated by two considerations. One is geological: in many sedimentary basins, a fault is unlikely to be conductive continuously from depth to the shallow subsurface. Leakage to surface or to USDW will involve a sequence of upward (along a fault) and lateral (within a permeable layer) migrations. Thus we will consider moderate conduit lengths of 1000 meters or less. The other consideration is practical: for CO2 storage to be implemented broadly and rapidly enough to mitigate anthropogenic emissions, thousands of storage projects will be needed. Each will have to be permitted by regulators in a streamlined yet robust and transparent way. Unfortunately the physical properties of most storage formations \u2013 deep saline aquifers \u2013 will be poorly constrained prior to injection. In light of this uncertainty, simple models that allow adequate physics-based risk assessment will be valuable tools for operators, regulators and policymakers. The model presented here was developed to be applicable within the Certification Framework (CF) for geologic storage (Oldenburg and Bryant 2007, Oldenburg et al. 2008). The purpose of the CF is to provide a framework for project proponents, regulators, and the public to analyze the risks of geologic CO2 storage in a simple and transparent way. The risk analysis would be performed to certify the startup and decommissioning of sites for geologic CO2 storage. The CF currently emphasizes risks associated with subsurface processes and excludes compression, transportation, and injection-well leakage risk. The CF is designed to be simple by (1) using proxy concentrations or fluxes, rather than complicated exposure functions, for quantifying impact; (2) using a catalog of pre-computed CO2 injection results (Kumar 2008), and (3) using a simple framework for calculating leakage risk. For transparency, the CF endeavors to be clear and precise in terminology in order to communicate to the full spectrum of stakeholders. One concept of the CF is that leakage occurs along conduits from the storage volume to \u201ccompartments\u201d such as hydrocarbon reservoirs or USDW. The risk associated with leakage is the product of the probability of leakage and the impact of that leakage. The flux of CO2 contributes to impact. Thus the goal of the faultleakage model is to estimate flux at an \u201coutlet\u201d of a conductive fault, once CO2 has arrived at the \u201cinlet\u201d. The overarching criteria of the CF and the models within it are simplicity, transparency and acceptability. Here we emphasize the requirement of simplicity. The subsurface data available as input to any numerical model in the CF will always be limited. This limitation is especially troublesome in the case of injection into saline aquifers. Saline aquifers provide large storage capacity but are not well characterized due to the small number of existing wells which could provide geologic information about that particular region of the subsurface. The flow properties of faults are even more uncertain, at least before injection begins. In principle the required properties could be obtained from appropriate measurement campaigns. In practice, measurement will increase the cost of storage, and cost minimization will be a high priority for any greenhouse gas mitigation strategy. Moreover, the most reliable measurements would come from wells drilled into the formation or through the fault. These wells would themselves be potential pathways for leakage. The philosophy of the fault-leakage model is thus to identify the key physical phenomena controlling leakage flux. The sensitivity of the flux to physical parameters provides insight as to which aquifer properties should be measured when designing or monitoring a storage project. In subsequent sections we present a quasi-1D mathematical description of CO2 flux using the \u201cleaky conduit\u201d model. The leaks correspond to permeable formations intersected by the conduit. A \u201cleakoff coefficient\u201d is used to control the rate of leakage. We describe a method for estimating these coefficients from the properties of the formations. To test whether these idealizations are reasonable, we carry out simulations of the full physics of the problem in a 2D domain. Quasi-1D Modeling Approach Assumptions. We assume that the CO2 storage reservoir is located at sufficient depth for the carbon dioxide to be modeled as a slightly compressible fluid. Intersecting this storage volume is a fault, either vertical or at a fixed angle to the storage reservoir (Fig. 1). The most stringent assumption of the model is that we only consider the flow of a single fluid, namely CO2, along the fault.

The survey of studies was conducted with an emphasis on the modeling techniques, the objective of studies, the prevalent simulated variables and the use of specific software packages. The analysis showed that geochemical modeling is still predominantly employed in experimental projects and in the form of equilibrium modeling. PHREEQC and Visual MINTEQ were recognized as the most popular software packages for simulating a wide range of processes, using equilibrium or other geochemical modeling forms. The study of fluid\u2013rock interactions and pollution and remediation processes can be regarded as the principal geochemical modeling objectives, constituting 37% and 36% of the reviewed studies, respectively. Focusing on fluid\u2013rock interactions, hydrogeochemical processes, carbon capture and storage and enhanced oil recovery have been the main topics examined with geochemical modeling. Assessments of the toxicity of metals in terms of leachate and mobilization, as well as their removal from soil and water systems, have been major topics investigated with the aid of geochemical modeling in terms of pollution and remediation research. It was found that the scholars benefit from geochemical modeling in their research both as a main technique and as an accessory tool. Saturation index, elemental concentration and speciation, mineral mass and composition and pH were among the most common variables modeled in reviewed studies.

So far, most of the studies performed on this topic have been limited in scope, primarily focusing on investigating the impact of the CO2 stream impurities on each part of the Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) chain in isolation. This is a significant drawback given the markedly different sensitivities of the pipeline, well bore materials and storage sites to the various impurities. For example, given the risk of water table contamination, trace elements such as Lead, Mercury and Arsenic in the CO2 stream are of far greater concern in an aquifer storage site than compared to the pipeline. On the other hand, even small concentrations of water in the CO2 stream are detrimental to the pipeline due to corrosion, but of benefit even at high concentrations during storage given the immobilisation effect of water on CO2. 'What is good for the pipeline is not necessarily good for storage'. It is clear that the optimum composition and concentration of the impurities in the captured CO2 stream involves a delicate balance between the different requirements within the CCS chain, spanning capture, transportation and storage, with cost and safety implications being the over-arching factor. Pivotal to these considerations is an understanding of the impact of the impurities on the physico-chemical properties of CO2 and its hazard profile. This paper presents and overview of the current FP7 European Commission CO2QUEST project involving the collaboration of 12 industry and academic partners in Europe, China and Canada aimed at addressing fundamentally important and urgent issues regarding the impact of the typical CO2 streams impurities captured from fossil fuel power plants on its safe and economic transportation and storage. The work programme, spanning 36 months, focuses on the development of state-of-the-art mathematical models, backed, by laboratory and industrial-scale experimentation using unique EC-funded test facilities to perform a comprehensive techno-economic, risk-based assessment of the impact of the CO2 stream impurities on the phase behaviour and the physico-chemical reactions governing the pipeline and storage site integrities. The above involves the determination of the important CO2 mixtures that have the most profound impact upon the pipeline pressure drop, compressor power requirements, pipeline propensity to ductile and brittle facture propagation, corrosion of the pipeline and well bore materials, geochemical interactions within the well bore and storage site, and the ensuing health and environmental hazards. Based on a cost/benefit analysis and whole system approach, the results will in turn be used to provide recommendations for tolerance levels, mixing protocols and control measures for pipeline networks and storage infrastructure thus contributing to the development of relevant standards for the safe design and operation of CCS.

In this article, for reducing CO2 emissions, meanwhile improving the utilization efficiency of wind power, a novel IEGS architecture with collaborative operation of power-to-gas (P2G), carbon capture system (CCS) and electric vehicles (EVs) is constructed. P2G is operated in a refined model combined with H2 storage and captured CO2 by CCS can be further consumed in reaction of P2G. Besides, EVs are innovatively adopted in IEGS as flexible energy resource to reduce the impact of wind power fluctuations. Additionally, a multi-step day ahead-intraday collaborative optimization framework is proposed to handle with the uncertainty of wind power, more accurate predicted wind power can be adopted under this framework. The objective function of constructed IEGS is minimize the total operating costs, which takes the CO2 processing costs and penalty costs of wind power deviations into consideration. Numerical studies are conducted with different cases, with the constructed structure and proposed multi-step optimization framework, the emissions of CO2 can be efficiently reduced and wind power utilization can be significantly improved, the total operating costs of IEGS can be reduced more than 20% compared with other cases, which demonstrates that the research of this article has better economic benefits and environmental friendliness.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "cea3493c28957199b82eeddf28717f654272307d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2626668130", "CorpusId": 113720308}, "title": "Correlative Rights and Limited Common Property in the Pore Space: A Response to the Challenge of Subsurface Trespass in Carbon Capture and Sequestration", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide and other substances injected as part of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) have the potential to migrate beyond the confines of the injection project, creating the potential for trespass.

The methodology uses a life cycle approach and considers relevant sustainability impacts along the supply chain. The framework is generic and applicable to a range of electricity technologies and scenarios. To test the methodology, sustainability assessments have been carried out first for different technologies and then for a range of possible future electricity scenarios for the UK. The electricity options considered either contribute significantly to the current UK electricity mix or will play a greater role in the future; these are nuclear power (PWR), natural gas (CCGT), wind (offshore), solar (residential PV) and coal power (subcritical pulverised). The results show that no one technology is superior and that certain tradeoffs must be made. For example, nuclear and offshore wind power have the lowest life cycle environmental impacts, except for freshwater eco-toxicity for which gas is the best option; coal and gas are the cheapest options, but both have high global warming potential; PV has relatively low global warming potential but high cost, ozone layer and resource depletion. Nuclear, wind and PV increase certain aspects of energy security but introduce potential grid management problems; nuclear also poses complex risk and intergenerational questions.Five potential future electricity mixes have also been examined within three overarching scenarios, spanning 2020 to 2070, and compared to the present-day UK grid. The scenarios have been guided by three different approaches to climate change: one future in which little action is taken to reduce CO2 emissions (?65%?), one in which electricity decarbonises by 80% by 2050 in line with the UK?s CO2 reduction target (?80%?), and one in which electricity is virtually decarbonised (at the point of generation) by 2050, in line with current policy (?100%?).In order to examine the sustainability implications of these scenarios, the assessment results from the present-day comparison were projected forward to describe each technology in future time periods. Additional data were compiled so that coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) ? a potentially key future technology ? could be included. The results of the scenario analyses show that the cost of generating electricity is likely to increase and become more capital-intensive. However, the lower-carbon scenarios are also at least 87% less sensitive to fuel price volatility. Higher penetration of nuclear and renewables generally leads to better environmental performance and more employment, but creates unknown energy storage costs and, in the case of nuclear power and coal CCS, the production of long-lived waste places a burden of management and risk on future generations.Therefore, the choice of the ?most sustainable? electricity options now and in the future will depend crucially on the importance placed on different sustainability impacts; this should be acknowledged in future policy and decision making. A good compromise requires strategic government action; to provide guidance, specific recommendations are made for future government policy.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "4529d402b7e62c6c973a750721d8cec3bbaa9eac", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2797553832", "DOI": "10.3390/SU10041174", "CorpusId": 158671150}, "title": "An Assessment of Direct Dissolved Inorganic Carbon Injection to the Coastal Region: A Model Result", "abstract": "The amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere has increased in the past 60 years and the technology of carbon capture and storage (CCS) has recently been extensively studied. One of the strategies of CCS is to directly inject a high dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentration (or high partial pressure of carbon dioxide, pCO2) solution into the ocean. However, the carbonate dynamics and air-sea gas exchange are usually neglected in a CCS strategy. This study assesses the effect of a DIC-solution injection by using a simple two end-member model to simulate the variation of pH, DIC, total alkalinity (TA) and pCO2 between the river and sea mixing process for the Danshuei River estuary and Hoping River in Taiwan. We observed that the DIC-solution injection can contribute to ocean acidification and can also lead the pCO2 value to change from being undersaturated to oversaturated (with respect to the atmospheric CO2 level). Our model result also showed that the maximum Revelle factors (\u0394[CO2]/[CO2])/(\u0394[DIC]/[DIC]) among varied pH values (6\u20139) and DIC concentrations (0.5\u20133.5 mmol kg\u22121) were between pH 8.3 and 8.5 in fresh water and were between 7.3 and 7.5 in waters with a salinity of 35, reflecting the changing efficiency of dissolving CO2 gas into the DIC solution and the varying stability of this desired DIC solution.

CO2 capture and storage can support the transition of our fossil fuel based energy supply towards a sustainable energy system, based upon nuclear and renewable sources. Our present energy infrastructure will largely remain the same during this transition period. For example, electric power plants will be equipped with CO2 capture units, but will produce the same electricity, transported and distributed over the same grid. The first step in the CO2 capture and storage chain is to capture carbon in a high concentration. This can be done before or after combustion of the fuel. Capture is best carried out at large sources of emissions, such as power stations, refineries and other industrial complexes. There are several ways to capture CO2, some of the main methods are absorbents using solvents or solid sorbents, which have been used in industry for several years and seems to be the most feasible solution at this time; membranes have also become an interesting alternative and although extensive research is in progress, new materials for membranes have yet to be discovered.

Thermodynamic models play a vital role in these modelling and simulation studies. Hence, this study critically reviews the thermodynamic models applied in the modelling of solvent-based CO2 capture systems over the past years, to provide a guideline for the selection of the optimum models for future studies. These models have wide applications in two main areas: equilibrium modelling [vapour-liquid equilibrium (VLE) (physical) and speciation equilibrium (chemical)], and calculation of some thermodynamic properties. VLE and speciation modelling methods are classified rigorously. VLE modelling methods are classified as homogeneous, heterogeneous, and empirical, and speciation modelling methods are classified as iterative (which could be stoichiometric and non-stoichiometric) and non-iterative. Thermodynamic models are categorised into three key families: activity-coefficient based, equation of state based, and quantum mechanical based.

Since the advent of industrialization, there has been an increase in the use of fossil fuels to fulfil rising energy demands. The usage of such fuels results in the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases, which result in increased temperature. Such warming is extremely harmful to life on Earth. The development of technology to counter the climate change and spreading it for widespread adoptions. We need to establish a framework to provide overarching guidance for the well-functioning of technology and mechanism development of Carbon Capture and Storage. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is widely regarded as a critical approach for achieving the desired CO2 emission reduction. Various elements of CCS, such as state-of-the-art technology for CO2 collection, separation, transport, storage, politics, opportunities, and innovations, are examined and explored in this paper. Carbon capture and storage is the process of capturing and storing carbon dioxide (CO2) before it is discharged into the environment (CCS). The technology can capture high amounts of CO2 produced by fossil fuel combustion in power plants and industrial processes. CO2 is compressed and transferred by pipeline, ship, or road tanker once it has been captured. CO2 can then be piped underground, usually to depths of 1km or more, and stored in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, coalbeds, or deep saline aquifers, depending on the geology. CO2 could also be used to produce commercially marketable products. With the goal of keeping world average temperatures below 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F) and preventing global average temperature rises of more than 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F) over pre-industrial levels, CCS model should be our priority to be implemented with the proper economical map", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "b91bb847ea0e13a3bb4d87ab74acbe4ab1338090", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3022554318", "DOI": "10.34194/geusb.v35.4946", "CorpusId": 222377255}, "title": "Mapping of the CO2 storage potential in the Nordic region", "abstract": "The concept of utilising available pore space in deep saline sandstone aquifers for storage of CO2 was recognised in the late 1980s.

Reductions of carbon emissions to the atmosphere includes strategies to not only capture and store carbon emissions from, for example, coal fired power plants, but also includes strategies such as increasing energy efficiency, greater use of renewable energy sources, and greater use of fuels that do not contain carbon (such as nuclear) or are carbon- neutral. Over the next several centuries most or all of the earth's fossil fuel reserves (about 4000 Gt-C) may be consumed, with the hope that carbon capture and storage (CCS) will minimize future greenhouse gas emissions to levels that are not dangerous to the planet. However, as discussed in this paper, it may not be possible for repositories to reliably store the massive amounts of carbon generated without imposing environmental risks. Further, while control of global warming is of immediate concern, possibilities of other types of climate change exist. Abrupt changes could be triggered that, for example, might reduce the deep North Atlantic circulation and produce a cooling over much of the earth. Second, the earth has been in an interglacial warm period for over 10,000 years, and if the climate cycles observed in the previous 500,000 years continue, it is possible that the earth will return to a colder period. Ultimately, control of global cooling may be a more challenging problem than control of global warming. If reduction of greenhouse gas emissions turns out not to be the complete solution to climate change mitigation requirements (which may involve both warming and cooling periods), what is? In this paper, earth-based and space- based techniques are explored that are designed to supplement greenhouse gas reduction approaches. While the strategies presented here may be futuristic and expensive, they do provide us with an outlook on controlling global climate change that may spawn ideas for other mitigation techniques. General design considerations are presented based on a global energy balance model to predict global temperature changes not only in response to changing greenhouse gas concentrations, but also to changing conditions in the earth system, such as the net incoming solar radiation or the planetary albedo. The approaches are intended to perturb the earth's energy balance in a controllable manner. Today, for example, data show that the earth is not in an equilibrium energy state. About 1.0 W/m2 more energy is coming into the earth than is leaving, indicating that the earth is \"committed\" to this amount of global warming and its attendant consequences, even if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmospheredo not continue to increase. This energy imbalance is equivalent to a further warming of 0.5degC to 1degC, comparable to the observed global warming that has occurred over the past century. One benefit of the supplemental mitigation techniques would be to help \"uncommit\" earth from such energy imbalances, as well as to provide a basis for addressing future climate change.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "554eec731dc55af324e1d9ed4d2550f30b5ca144", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2013932550", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.20140099", "CorpusId": 129822347}, "title": "The Application of Muon Tomography to Carbon Storage Monitoring", "abstract": "Post-injection monitoring of stored super-critical carbon dioxide will play a crucial role in the carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry.

Recent studies have shown the need for operational connection among water resource managers, watershed managers and aquatic ecosystem managers (Lin, 2012). Despite apparent differences, these three management domains are scientifically and socially interdependent. Climate change regulation and ecosystem/habitat degradation have signaled growing constraints for managing ecosystem-human interface. Further, despite operational interdependence, the three main ecosystem domains; air, land and water are studied in relative isolation. Coupled with the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), carbon (C) has become central to understand cross-domain ecosystem linkages and the effects of human perturbations therein. The concern for carbon enrichment of inland waters has focused on two major issues: the nutrient-driven increase in autochthonous C-pool leading to changes in water quality (Monteith et al., 2007; Pandey and Pandey, 2013); and, enhanced allochthonous C export and associated shifts in carbon balance of the water body (Cole et al., 2007; Buffam et al., 2011; Pandey and Pandey, 2013; Pandey et al., 2014). Regional scale studies have shown the potential role of hydrological transport for landscape C budget and have highlighted the importance of interaction of different landscape elements (Buffam et al., 2011). Sensitivity of surface waters, whether as a net C sink or source, and their vulnerability to changing atmospheric deposition chemistry differ at a range of temporal and spatial scales and may provide important cue for regional C budget. Studies on impact of atmospheric deposition of nutrients on lakes have been confined mainly to temperate and subarctic regions (Weyhenmeyer and Karlsson, 2009). To date, no data so for is available from Indian tropics addressing explicitly the human-induced changes in atmosphere-land-water transfer and subsequent influence on C balance of freshwater lakes. Recent studies have indicated that Indian surface waters are receiving increasingly high input of atmospherically deposited (AD) nutrients (Pandey and Pandey, 2009; 2013; Pandey et al., 2013; 2014). The AD-nutrients may alter ecosystem attributes via direct deposition to water surface and via deposition on land surface and subsequent modifications in the catchment (Whitall et al., 2003; Pandey, 2011). Air-driven nutrients delivered directly on water surfaces enhance phytoplankton blooming (Bergstrom et al., 2008) while atmospheric input in catchment may alter quality of organic matter and subsequent runoff reaching to waterways (Wedin and Tilman, 1996; Pandey, 2011). Changes in soil organic matter (SOM) solubility and the rate of microbial production or consumption of water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) from SOM in uppermost carbon rich soil horizon (Kalbitz et al., 2000) may be an important driver of DOC in receiving waters (Pandey and Pandey, 2013; Pandey et al., 2014).", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "eec4b76d68ba8867829ce8c14c402fb5316ea752", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2808507229", "DOI": "10.5194/GC-2-69-2019", "CorpusId": 150379082}, "title": "The takeover of science communication: how science lost its leading role in the public discourse on carbon capture and storage research in daily newspapers in Germany", "abstract": "Abstract.

This analysis will aim to evaluate the effects of applying a broad but realistic range of reservoir, fault and gas chimney properties on potential CO2 leakage at various depths throughout the subsurface. Fluid flow might take place through parts of or the entire extent of the overburden. One of the aims of the analysis is assessing the potential of CO2 reaching the seabed. Using the Sn\u00f8hvit gas reservoir and overburden in the Barents Sea, a series of geological models were built using seismic and well-log data. We then performed numerical simulations of CO2 migration in focused fluid flow structures. Identification of potential migration pathways and their extent, such as gas chimneys and faults, and their incorporation into these models and simulations will provide a realistic insight into the migration potential of CO2. In the simulations the CO2 is injected over a 20\u00a0year period at a rate of 0.7\u00a0Mt/year and migration is allowed to take place over a 2000\u00a0year time frame for domains of approximately 21\u00a0km2 for the caprock fault models, 24\u00a0km2 for the realistic gas chimney models and 35\u00a0km2 for the generic gas chimney models, in a layered sedimentary succession. The total mass of CO2 injected in the reservoir during the 20-year injection period is 14 Mt. There is a strong interaction between the various parameters but the parameter that had the most influence on the CO2 migration process was probably the permeability of the reservoirs, especially the average permeability (k). Also, for the faulted caprock scenarios, it should be noted that at near surface depths the permeability of 765 mD is already adequate for a good CO2 flow. At the chimney top level (600\u00a0m) however, a further increase in permeability has an additional effect on improving CO2 flow.

Mainly due to the intermittency nature of applications like solar and wind. In addition, the need for regulation of the greenhouse gases led to the development of carbon capture and storage applications. Thus, the combination of those two factors accelerated the production of renewable fuels (called also solar fuels). Renewable fuels is a power-to-x solution of storing the surplus electric energy produced from renewable sources, via multiple steps processes. Hence, solar fuels can contribute immensely in a lorg-term, large-scale energy storage solution. Those fuels are synthetic hydrocarbon that derive from hydrogen (produced from renewables) and the CO2 captured. Some possible fuels are methanol, methane and liquid hydrocarbons. Amongst, those, methane is the most promising solution. It can be synthesized with a single reaction, it has high energy density and can be easily distributed. The methanation of CO2 is an exothermic catalytic reaction and takes place in multiple fixed bed reactors in row. In order for this renewable methane to be used as SNG, high purity levels are required. Hence, novel techniques are researched to achieve the necessary purity of methane in fewer process steps. The present study focuses on one of those techniques called separation enhanced methanation of CO2. The principle behind this technique is the removal, in situ, of the vapor produced by the reaction, to increase the conversion of reactants. This topic is approached experimentally. A fixed bed reactor built in house is used for the experiments. For the hydrogenation ofCO2 a nickel catalyst is used, coupled with two different zeolites (3A and 4A) for the adsorption ofwater vapor. Initially, the pure catalyst\u2019s performance was tested. Subsequently, the combinations of catalyst-zeolites (physical mixture) followed to determine the enhancement of the process. Two GHSV were applied in the experiments, for different temperatures in the range of 200\u00b1C-360\u00b1C. Also, different combinations of catalyst-zeolite 4A were deployed, regarding the size of the catalyst particles. Fromthe results, it was concluded that the proximity of the catalytic sites to the zeolites surface plays the most dominant role in the performance of the process. This proximity is linked to the average particle size and the uniformity of the bed.

The nested model resolves the \u2018fast\u2019 CO2 and H2O exchange processes using canopy turbulence theories and radiative transfer principles whereas slowly evolving processes were resolved using standard carbon allocation methods modified to improve leaf phenology. This model captured most of the intraannual variations in leaf area index (LAI), net ecosystem exchange (NEE), and LE for this stand in which maximum LAI was not at a steady state. The model comparisons suggest strong linkages between carbon production and LAI variability, especially at seasonal time scales. This linkage necessitates the use of multilayer models to reproduce the seasonal dynamics of LAI, NEE, and LE. However, our findings suggest that increasing model complexity, often justified for resolving faster processes, does not necessarily translate into improved predictive skills at all time scales. Additionally, none of the models tested here adequately captured drought effects on water and CO2 fluxes. Furthermore, the good performance of some models in capturing flux variability on interannual time scales appears to stem from erroneous LAI dynamics and from sensitivity to droughts that injects unrealistic flux variability at longer time scales. Key processes that are relevant to carbon transfer and storage in forested ecosystems can vary over multiple spatial and temporal scales. Upscaling these processes to estimate stand level NEE using process-based models is thus complex (Jarvis, 1995). Across time scales, NEE is influenced by fast processes such as turbulent transport mechanics (often measured in seconds) and slow processes such as forest growth (often measured in years to decades). In space, photosynthesis varies at the leaf scale (often measured in millimeters) whereas stand level variables such as tree density often vary over hundreds of meters (Baldocchi et al., 2000; Katul et al., 2001). This wide scale separation in time and space is complemented with a broad range of processbased models that have emerged to simulate different aspects of ecosystem carbon function.

Herein, the fabrication of 1mm-thick solid-state electrochemical devices based on poly(ionic liquid) ionogels with embedded electrodes capable of both adsorption and electrochemical reduction of CO2 is reported. The ionogels are prepared via radical polymerization and chemical crosslinking of a vinyl imidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonimide ionic liquid monomer in the presence of additional ionic liquids (ILs) that act as swelling agents and enhance ionic conductivity. The effects of the ILs concentration and the degree of crosslinking on the mechanical properties, conductivity, and CO2 adsorption of the ionogels are investigated. The ionogels are shown to have ionic conductivities as high as 0.6 mScm@1. The results of quartz crystal microbalance analyses demonstrates that the CO2 adsorption of the ionogels reaches up to &22 mgg@1, which is 10-fold higher than that of their native ionic liquid. Moreover, the ionogels are easily recoverable after CO2 adsorption. The flexibility, conductivity, and CO2 capture capacity of this system can be controlled by the crosslinking ratio and ionic liquid content of the ionogels. This electrochemical device has the potential to be used in large scale plants for capturing CO2 for further electrochemical reactions.

In this context, viable options are storage as a solid in the form of calcium or magnesium carbonate and conversion into other energetic frameworks. In addition, it is important to highlight that the conventional energy resources are progressively being replaced by renewable resources. While the change in energetic paradigm is not accomplished, systems that capture and convert carbon dioxide are highly sought. To this end, bio-inspired systems will be presented, starting from the use of compounds from the chiral pool, such as amino acids, saccharides and related bio-polymers, involved in the physical and chemical capture, sequestration and/or utilization of CO2. Additionally, enzymatic systems are presented in the context of sequestration of CO2 in the form of solid carbonates or even utilization of this C1 synthon in the preparation of fuels and commodity chemicals. Carbonic anhydrase is by far the most studied enzyme, as it catalyses the inter-conversion between CO2 and hydrogencarbonate in an effective mode.

Geologic sequestration results from the capturing of CO2 from combustion products and injecting the compressed gas as a supercritical fluid into subsurface brine aquifers for long-term storage. The Gulf Coast overlies an unusually thick succession of highly porous and permeable sand aquifers separated by thick shale aquitards. The Gulf Coast also has a large potential for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), in which CO2 injected into suitable oil reservoirs could be used first for EOR and then for large-volume, long-term storage of CO2 in nonproductive formations below the reservoir interval. For example, there are numerous opportunities for locating CO2 injection wells either in fields for EOR or in stacked brine aquifers near potential FutureGen sites, where a near-zero emission facility would generate primarily hydrogen and CO2 as by-products.

The pace of CCSU adoption and development is greatly impaired by its high cost and non-availability of funds in both developed and developing countries of the world.

Currently, fossil fuels are the predominant source of the global energy generation and the trend will continue for the rest of the century. Fossil fuels supply over 63% of all primary energy; the rest is contributed by nuclear, hydro-electricity and renewable energy. Although research and investments are being targeted to increase the percentage of renewable energy and foster conservation and efficiency improvements of fossil-fuel usage, development of CCS technology is the most important tool likely to play a pivotal role in addressing this crisis.

Direct mineral carbonation of alkaline solid wastes is one such technology that provides the benefit of being a permanent, cost effective and a promising on-site option, while improving the environmental quality of the waste. The present work attempts to study direct mineral carbonation of red mud (RM) with CO2 (concentration as in flue gas) by wet and dry route employing response surface methodology (RSM). Maximum reduction of about 18.5% in the concentration of CO2 was attained in wet carbonation conditions (65.1 \u00baC, 42.1\u2009bar, L/S ratio of 0.53, 1\u2009h) and the sequestration capacity of RM was found to be 15.5\u2009g of CO2/kg, correspondingly. The models were found to be statistically significant (R2 value > 98.5%). Temperature and reaction time were found to influence the dry route. Meanwhile in wet route, temperature, pressure, liquid to solid (L/S) ratio and reaction time were all significant. The results demonstrated that RM could significantly sequester CO2 even from flue gas. The carbonation process was evidenced using Fourier-Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "22bd423d00ba2cc82cafd5e231381152d7f6c0b1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2022592063", "DOI": "10.1115/IMECE2008-67424", "CorpusId": 95398361}, "title": "Quantum Thermodynamics for the Modeling of Hydrogen Storage on a Carbon Nanotube", "abstract": "A typical approach for modeling systems at a nanoscale in states of non-equilibrium undergoing an irreversible process is to use an ad hoc mixture of molecular dynamics (linear and nonlinear), i.e. classical mechanics, coupled to assumptions of stable equilibrium which allow one via analogy to incorporate equilibrium thermodynamic state information such as temperature and pressure into the modeling process. However, such an approach cannot describe the actual thermodynamic evolution in state which occurs in these systems since the equation of motion used (Newton\u2019s second law) can only describe the evolution in state from one mechanical state to another. To capture the actual thermodynamic evolution, a more general equation of motion is needed. Such an equation has been proposed, i.e. the Beretta equation of motion, as part of a general theory, which unifies (not simply bridges as is the case in statistical thermodynamics) quantum mechanics and thermodynamics. It is called the unified quantum theory of mechanics and thermodynamics or quantum thermodynamics. This equation, which strictly satisfies all of the implications of the laws of thermodynamics, including the second law, as well as of quantum mechanics, describes the thermodynamic evolution in state of a system in non-equilibrium regardless of whether or not the system is in a state far from or close to stable equilibrium. This theory and its dynamical postulate are used here to model the storage of hydrogen in an isolated box modeled in 1D and 2D with a carbon atom at one end of the box in 1D and a carbon nanotube in the middle of the box in 2D. The system is prepared in a state with the hydrogen molecules initially far from stable equilibrium, after which the system is allowed to relax (evolve) to a state of stable equilibrium. The so-called energy eigenvalue problem is used to determine the energy eigenlevels and eigenstates of the system, while the nonlinear Beretta equation of motion is used to determine the evolution of the thermodynamic state of the system as well as the spatial distributions of the hydrogen molecules in time. The results of our initial simulations show in detail the trajectory of the state of the system as the hydrogen molecules, which are initially arranged to be far from the carbon atom or the carbon nanotube, are seen to spread out in the container and eventually become more concentrated near the carbon atom or atoms.Copyright \u00a9 2008 by ASME", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "d53588a9f4e22207203f45ab8d9a392ae823eaa6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2069814209", "DOI": "10.1080/14786451.2012.742897", "CorpusId": 111218154}, "title": "CO2 emissions and carbon capture and storage prospects in the electric power industry of Guangdong Province, China", "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to characterise the electric power industry's CO2 emissions and to understand its carbon capture and storage (CCS) prospects in China's Guangdong Province.

Yet the processes, which govern the decomposition and subsequent long\u2010term storage of organic matter (OM) and C in these habitats, remain poorly understood. The Tea Bag Index (TBI) uses a standardized OM (green and Rooibos tea) and has the potential to shed light on OM decomposition across habitats, including saltmarshes. Here, we apply the TBI method at two saltmarshes within the same estuary with the aim of (i) reducing the influence of climatic variables and (ii) determining the role of the environment, including the soil characteristics, in the decomposition of OM. We extended the standard (3 months) incubation period over a full year in order to investigate the longer\u2010term decomposition processes at each site. The initial results partially support previous studies that the early stages of decomposition (leaching of the water\u2010soluble fraction) is governed by climatic conditions, but may be further enhanced by tidal flushing in saltmarshes. By extending the incubation period, we observed the initiation of midstage OM decomposition (cellulose degradation) upon which the soil characteristics appear to be the dominant control. These results highlight the importance of long\u2010term TBI incubations to understand early\u2010stage OM decomposition.

CCS systems separate CO2 during the process of converting fuel and transport to the facilities where they are stored, e.g., under geological formation conditions. Capture and sequestration technologies are now widely used in different industries. CO2 capture is currently a costly and energy-consuming technology. The costs obviously depend on the size of the plant and the type of fuel used. Generally, capture systems are categorized into three categories: pre-combustion, post-combustion, and oxy-fuel combustion. The saline aquifer, depleted oil, and gas fields are large-capacity storage sinks. The coalbeds also provide as a substitute to geological storage. One of the main advantages of coal storage is renewable methane fuel and coal desulfurization. The studied coal reserves are located in Candiota, State of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. These are the largest coal deposits in the country, with a reserve of 1 billion tons. This work will represent a study on CO2 storage in Candiota coalbed system. The use of a synthetic CO2 cylinder with a flow of 0.2 L /min varies the time of contact with the coalbed. The results from the volatile matter increase by 11%. The results of the ultimate analysis exhibited an 8% increase for carbon and oxygen after 60 minutes of CO2 flow in the coalbed. On the other hand, there was a reduction of 32% for sulfur.

The goal of this study was to determine the forest structure and estimate biomass accumulation above and below ground in the mangrove forest of Gazi Bay. The western, middle, and eastern forest blocks of the Gazi Bay mangrove forest were investigated for forest structure, whereas the western forest block was determined for biomass accumulation. To calculate below-ground biomass accumulation, in-growth cores of 80 cm long, 20 cm broad, and 60 cm deep were employed. Aboveground biomass accumulation was calculated using data on tree height and stem diameter at breast height (DBH-130). Leaf phenology was observed by tagging shoots. At the start, environmental variables were measured every four months for a year across four mangrove species zones. The linear regeneration sampling approach was used to determine the composition and distribution pattern of natural regeneration (LRS). Salinity revealed a strong negative connection with above-ground biomass accumulation among the soil environment characteristics studied. Sonneratia alba had the highest biomass accretion rate of 10.5 1.9 t ha-1 yr-1 among the four forest zones.

Electricity generation may become a key factor that accelerates water scarcity. In this study, we estimated the future global water use for electricity generation from 2005 to 2100 in 17 global sub-regions. Twenty-two future global change scenarios were examined, consisting of feasible combinations of five socioeconomic scenarios of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and six climate mitigation scenarios based on four forcing levels of representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and two additional forcing levels, to assess the impacts of socioeconomic and climate mitigation changes on water withdrawal and consumption for electricity generation. Climate policies such as targets of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are determined by climate mitigation scenarios. Both water withdrawal and consumption were calculated by multiplying the electricity generation of each energy source (e.g., coal, nuclear, biomass, and solar power) and the energy source-specific water use intensity. The future electricity generation dataset was derived from the Asia-Pacific Integrated/Computable General Equilibrium (AIM/CGE) model. Estimated water withdrawal and consumption varied significantly among the SSPs. In contrast, water withdrawal and consumption differed little among the climate mitigation scenarios even though GHG emissions depend on them. There are two explanations for these outcomes. First, electricity generation for energy sources requiring considerable amounts of water varied widely among the SSPs, while it did not differ substantially among the climate mitigation scenarios. Second, the introduction of more carbon capture and storage strategies increased water withdrawal and consumption under stronger mitigation scenarios, while the introduction of more renewable energy decreased water withdrawal and consumption. Therefore, the socioeconomic changes represented by the SSPs had a larger impact on water withdrawal and consumption for electricity generation, compared with the climate mitigation changes represented by the climate mitigation scenarios. The same trends were observed on a regional scale, even though the composition of energy sources differed completely from that on a global scale.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "73b7e8abc9390af2795073bee5051c04ecebfda3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1656338914", "DOI": "10.9713/KCER.2012.50.6.988", "CorpusId": 94628530}, "title": "Process Design and Cost Estimation of Carbon Dioxide Compression and Liquefaction for Transportation", "abstract": "\uc774\uc0b0\ud654\ud0c4\uc18c \ud3ec\uc9d1 \ubc0f \uc800\uc7a5 \uae30\uc220 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc1a1 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ucc98\ub9ac \uacfc\uc815\uc778 \ucd08\uc784\uacc4 \uc555\ucd95 \ubc0f \uc561\ud654 \uacf5\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c \uc555\ucd95 \ubc29\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc640 \uadf8 \ub54c\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc0b0\ud654\ud0c4\uc18c\ub97c \ucd08\uc784\uacc4\uc0c1\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc555\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0(\uacf5\uc815 1-1), \uc561\ud654 \ud6c4 \ud38c\ud504\ub85c \ucd08\uc784\uacc4\uc0c1\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0(\uacf5\uc815 1-2), \uc774\uc0b0\ud654\ud0c4\uc18c\uc758 \uac00\uc555 \ud33d\ucc3d\uc73c\ub85c \uc561\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0(\uacf5\uc815 2), \ub2e4\ub978 \ub0c9\ub9e4\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uadf8 \ub0c9\ub9e4\ub97c \uac00\uc555, \ud33d\ucc3d\uc73c\ub85c \uc5bb\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0(\uacf5\uc815 3-1), \ub0c9\ub9e4\ub97c \ud761\uc218 \ub0c9\uac01\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc5bb\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0(\uacf5\uc815 3-2), \uce90\uc2a4\ucf00\uc774\ub4dc \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0(\uacf5\uc815 4)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c \uac01\uac01 \uacf5\uc815 \ubaa8\uc0ac\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70 \uadf8 \ub54c\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ube44\uc6a9\uc740 $4~7/ton\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ub41c\ub2e4. \u3010Energy and cost analysis of the preprocessing for carbon capture and storage transportation such as supercritical compression and liquefaction is done using chemical simulation model.

This approach is well suited to practical applications in the design and assessment of the performance of complex composite fibre/polymer reinforced materials, thereby helping to ensure sufficient fire safety performance. Introduction Carbon fibre composite materials are commonly used in high pressure cylinders for storage and transport of hydrogen. Despite significant strength, low burst potential and low weight of these vessels, they may be vulnerable to fire due to the combustible nature of the constituent materials. Understanding the performance of the composite material in fire is essential to prevent bursting of the vessels and the associated consequences. Furthermore, this will allow development of new fire protection strategies and improvement of current standards. This work is specifically focussed on developing the tools that will allow the prediction of the thermal behaviour of hydrogen pressure vessels with stationary and transport application during the design stage considering an arbitrary temporally and spatially varying fire boundary condition. Fig. 1. Vessel of carbon fibre composite during manufacturing It has been demonstrated that existing models of thermal decomposition can introduce large uncertainties due to the number of parameters required to characterise the material and combustion environment (i.e. material parameters which determine these phenomena) [1,2]. Therefore, this work explores a novel simplified method to analyse the coupled mechanisms of heat transfer and thermal degradation for carbon fibre composite materials under controlled conditions of heat exposure. The application of this methodology is based on the combination of small scale Cone Calorimeter and thermogravimetric experiments, through a two-step uncoupled analysis in order to quantify the rates of mass loss/pyrolysis.

It makes sense, instead, for interested countries to take some action now to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including putting a price on emissions. It also makes sense to focus on research and development - including how best to adapt to climate change, improve our understanding of geoengineering, and improve the cost effectiveness of carbon capture and storage for coal burning power plants.

Of the various responses to this \u201csuper wicked problem\u201d, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one that has been mooted in Australia during recent years. While many commentators continue to question the technological and economic feasibility of CCS, a number of Australian governments have adopted a proactive stance to CCS by amending or enacting legislation to regulate CCS activities in their respective jurisdictions. To date, there has been little critical examination of these legislative regimes and their implications for the future role of CCS in Australia. Accordingly, this article will focus upon one central area of CCS regulation that has not been comprehensively addressed by the existing literature \u2013 that is, the extent to which emerging legislative regimes for regulating CCS activities in Australia facilitate access to procedural justice. Access to procedural justice will generally be facilitated in circumstances where the law gives procedural rights to members of the community of justice to: have access to information, participate in decision-making processes, and have access to review procedures before a court or tribunal to challenge decision-making or impairment of substantive or procedural rights. This article undertakes a comparative analysis of the laws that have been enacted or amended to regulate CCS activities in Australian jurisdictions in order to identify standards of best practice for facilitating access to procedural justice. It finds that while many of the laws regulating CCS activities in Australia reflect clear attempts by government to facilitate access to procedural justice, some of these laws fall short of facilitating access to procedural justice in an adequate or sufficient manner.

Subsequently, leading to the greenhouse gas effect and climate change and contemporarily, quest and usage of fossil fuels has increased dramatically in recent times. The only solution to resolve the problem of CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere is geological/subsurface storage of carbon dioxide or carbon capture and storage (CCS). Additionally, CO 2 can be employed in the oil and gas fields for enhanced oil recovery operations and this cyclic form of the carbon dioxide injection into reservoirs for recovering oil and gas is known as CO 2 Enhanced Oil and Gas Recovery (EOGR). Hence, this paper presents the CO 2 retention dominance in tight oil and gas reservoirs in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) of the Alberta Province, Canada. Actually, hysteresis modeling was applied in the oil and gas reservoirs of WCSB for sequestering or trapping CO 2 and EOR as well. Totally, four cases were taken for the investigation, such as WCSB Alberta tight oil and gas reservoirs with CO 2 huff-n-puff and flooding processes. Actually, Canada has complex geology and therefore, implicate that it can serve as a promising candidate that is suitable and safer place for CO 2 storage. Furthermore, injection pressure, time, rate (mass), number of cycles, soaking time, fracture half-length, conductivity, porosity, permeability, and initial reservoir pressure were taken as input parameters and cumulative oil production and oil recovery factor are the output parameters, this is mainly for tight oil reservoirs. In the tight gas reservoirs, only the output parameters differ from the oil reservoir, such as cumulative gas production and gas recovery factor. Reservoirs were modelled to operate for 30\u00a0years of oil and gas production and the factor year was designated as decision-making unit (DMU). CO 2 retention was estimated in all four models and overall the gas retention in four cases showed a near sinusoidal behavior and the variations are sporadic. More than 80% CO 2 retention in these tight formations were achieved and the major influencing factors that govern the CO 2 storage in these tight reservoirs are injection pressure, time, mass, number of cycles, and soaking time. In general, the subsurface geology of the Canada is very complex consisting with many structural and stratigraphic layers and thus, it offers safe location for CO 2 storage through retention mechanism and increasing the efficiency and reliability of oil and gas extraction from these complicated subsurface formations.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "8d7fe1e17f6e9ef15b9b11610d9f33e9f90a20cb", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 14296968}, "title": "Olivine against climate change and ocean acidification", "abstract": "The weathering of calcium and magnesium silicates is the main natural mechanism limiting atmospheric CO2 levels. The weathering process transforms CO2 into bicarbonate, which washes down to the oceans where it ultimately precipitates as carbonate. However weathering at its natural pace is unable to keep up with current and prospective anthropogenic CO2 production. Thus we propose to mitigate excess CO2 by increasing the rate of weathering: olivine, volcanic ash and similar silicate rocks should be mined, milled, and spread widely, mainly in the humid tropics where weathering rates are highest. This may produce important additional benefits, reversing the acidification of soils, rivers and oceans, and enriching soils with mineral nutrients. Oceans would receive additional fluxes of orthosilicic acid, a limiting nutrient for marine diatoms: the consequent increase in diatom phytoproductivity could increase carbon fluxes to deep ocean, or support the production of biofuels in 'diatom farms'. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology attached to power stations is currently being pursued as a solution to climate change. However CCS costs are estimated as $50-$100/t CO2, while there are fears as to the long term security of reservoirs.
