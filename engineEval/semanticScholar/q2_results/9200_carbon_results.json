It is viewed as the most promising technology to separate carbon dioxide (CO2) at point emission sources such as fossil fuel fired power plants as a part of a strategy called \u2018carbon capture and storage\u2019 being deployed to mitigate climate change. However, there are major challenges in advancing its use for this application; the most prominent one being \u2013 cost. It is estimated that the application of current technology to CO2 capture will result in a 70\u2013100% increase in the cost of electricity (COE). As a part of this two-part study, we have examined the influence of stripper operating parameters on carbon capture at a 400 MW pulverized coal-fired power plant retrofitted with amine absorption technology. We use the process simulation software, ProMax\u00ae to simulate the amine absorption process. Three commercial absorbents namely monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA) and diglycolamine (DGA) are considered in this work. All the absorbents examined are studied at the typical working concentrations used in commercial operation. We also constrain the CO2 loading of rich amine solution to 0.4 mol-CO2/mol-amine to closely resemble the chemical environment in commercial operation. The main pointer used to compare system performance is the parasitic power loss due to the carbon capture. Parasitic power loss comprises of the loss of plant output due to withdrawal of reboiler steam from the low pressure turbine; the electricity required for CO2 compression and by the plant auxiliaries such as blowers and pumps. We also examine the absorber and stripper column sizes and heat exchanger parameters which are key components of the system. On the basis of our findings in the first part of this study, we report that operating the stripper at higher pressures has significant advantages but also some disadvantages and operational challenges. We also report that DEA and DGA have a superior performance to MEA when used in high pressure strippers. We conclude that increasing the stripper pressure reduces the parasitic losses and the equipment sizing but may result in higher solvent losses and equipment corrosion.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "ddda60ba9336ce00d283bbca1f7b9b9389d1f110", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2068877785", "DOI": "10.1098/rspa.1978.0134", "CorpusId": 98612579}, "title": "The Bakerian Lecture, 1977: In vitro models for photosynthesis", "abstract": "Attempts to construct, in vitro, systems which imitate parts of the photosynthetic process serve two purposes.

This will involve many thousands of miles of dedicated high-pressure pipelines in order to transport many millions of tonnes of CO2 annually, with the CO2 delivered to many thousands of wells that will inject the CO2 underground. The new CCS infrastructure could rival in size the current U.S. upstream natural gas pipeline and well infrastructure. This new infrastructure entails hazards for life, health, animals, the environment, and natural resources. Pipelines are known to rupture due to corrosion, from external forces such as impacts by vehicles or digging equipment, by defects in construction, or from the failure of valves and seals. Similarly, wells are vulnerable to catastrophic failure due to corrosion, cement degradation, or operational mistakes. While most accidents involving pipelines and wells will be minor, there is the inevitable possibility of accidents with very high consequences, especially to public health. The most important consequence of concern is CO2 release to the environment in concentrations sufficient to cause death by asphyxiation to nearby populations. Such accidents are thought to be very unlikely, but of course they cannot be excluded, even if major engineering effort is devoted (as it will be) to keeping their probability low and their consequences minimized. This project has developed a methodology for analyzing the risks of these rare but high-consequence accidents, using a step-by-step probabilistic methodology. A key difference between risks for pipelines and wells is that the former are spatially distributed along the pipe whereas the latter are confined to the vicinity of the well. Otherwise, the methodology we develop for risk assessment of pipeline and well failures is similar and provides an analysis both of the annual probabilities of accident sequences of concern and of their consequences, and crucially the methodology provides insights into what measures might be taken to mitigate those accident sequences identified as of concern. Mitigating strategies could address reducing the likelihood of an accident sequence of concern, or reducing the consequences, or some combination. The methodology elucidates both local and integrated risks along the pipeline or at the well providing information useful to decision makers at various levels including local (e.g., property owners and town councils), regional (e.g., county and state representatives), and national levels (federal regulators and corporate proponents).", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "0495b61b3cbb548189d4d37076223d1689f3a088", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2998557432", "DOI": "10.29267/mxjb.2020.5.1.1", "CorpusId": 212849469}, "title": "A biotechnological expansion of shellfish cultivation could permanently remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere", "abstract": "To combat climate change, proposals have been made to develop methods that would pull carbon dioxide out of Earth\u2019s atmosphere. One recommended approach is to remove CO2 from the atmosphere with activities such as reforestation and changing forest management and agricultural practices to enhance soil carbon storage.

Furthermore, decay of dead wood and fallen leaves in natural forests releases huge quantities of CO2 and other greenhouse gases back into the atmosphere. The only other carbon-sequestration technique that is widely considered is the application of CO2 capture processes to flue gases of power plants, which are responsible for about 80% of the worldwide CO2 emission from large stationary sources.

Injecting CO2 into depleted oil reservoirs can reach the dual goal of carbon storage and enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR). To optimize the gas injection strategy, it is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms of three-phase fluid flow of oil, water and gas. In this study, a lattice Boltzmann (LB) color gradient model is used to investigate pore-scale three-phase displacement process in porous media. Gas is injected into the porous domain initially occupied by water and oil. Typical microscopic behaviors, including coalescence and split-up, pinch-off, double and multiple displacement, as well as parallel flow, are identified and discussed. Effects of water content ( \u03d5), capillary number ( Ca), wettability and viscosity ratio ( M) on the flow pattern and oil recovery rate are explored. The oil ganglia inhibit the development of gas fingers, causing stronger viscous fingering characteristics with increasing \u03d5. The fingering pattern located in the crossover zone for the Ca from 5\u00d710-5 to 5\u00d710-4. As \u03d5 increases, the oil recovery rate reduces. The oil ganglia tend to occupy small pores as oil wettability enhanced, making it more difficult to be drained out. The reduction of oil viscosity is beneficial to improve connectivity, thereby effectively enhancing the oil recovery. Finally, the CO2 storage rate is also evaluated. It is found that the storage rate is very sensitive to the initial oil-water distributions.

This means a re-design with the goal of implementing the EU's internal market and far-reaching decarbonisation. The example of Germany's energy U-turn shows one possible route, one that is marked by a massive expansion of renewable energies coupled with a phase-out of nuclear energy. Other European countries are pursuing different strategies. Current developments show that solutions chosen in any one country have direct implications for its neighbours. This is because electricity markets are continuing to grow together. In a spirit of solidarity between the member states, the closest possible review and coordination and/or harmonisation of policies are needed. This will allow the conversion process, which is associated with macroeconomic costs, to be shaped on a cost-efficient basis. For utilities, the energy turnaround brings with it a multitude of challenges. Utilities must convert their generation portfolio and, in particular, perceptibly increase their share of low-carbon energies. Conventional power plants must be designed flexibly, so that \u2013 besides volatility in consumption \u2013 fluctuations in the feed-in of renewable energies, too, can be offset. In addition to this technical requirement, energy suppliers are facing a situation in which the utilisation period of conventional power stations is falling as a result of the growing feed-in of renewables. On top of this comes the fact that wholesale electricity prices on sunny days are pushed down despite high demand owing to the growing feed-in of electricity from photovoltaic systems. Both factors limit the options for obtaining the necessary contributions to cover fixed costs on the market. This raises the issue of the market design of the future. The launch of capacity mechanisms, ie remuneration for the product \u2018firm capacity\u2019 supplementing the income obtained from the sale of electricity, could help. At the same time, capacity mechanisms could be a suitable instrument for coping with power failures. This brings politics into the game. With electricity markets growing together, the central requirement to be met by a capacity-market mechanism is that harmonised regulations, a discrimination-free design and technology neutrality are ensured throughout Europe. This is regarded as indispensable for creating a level playing field. Also as regards reaching the goal of Europe's climate policy, viz. a lowering of greenhouse-gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050 compared with 1990, the rule must be to prioritise European solutions over any national regulation. In addition, a procedure in climate policy that is more stringently reviewed at international level is considered unavoidable. Cost efficiency in reaching climate goals means backing market instruments. CO2 emissions trading should be accorded the role of leading instrument in climate protection. The instrument can be used to achieve agreed quantity targets for CO2 emissions reliably and at the least possible costs. One argument in favour of anchoring the trade in emissions as leading instrument to shape a sustainable energy supply is that the costs of transforming the energy system can be kept within bounds. Renewable energies enter the system with rising CO2 prices on a market-driven basis. The various technologies compete with one another and with other CO2- avoidance technologies, like increases in efficiency, utilisation of nuclear energy and CO2 capture and storage (CCS). One current study says that the expected growth in electricity consumption in the EU by some 1,000 TWh by 2050 will be covered by adding renewable energies if the focus is on trade in emissions as leading instrument. This doubles the share of renewables in power generation by 2050 to about 50%. After 2030, with rising CO2 prices, CCS, too, becomes profitable. If we were to rule out this technology for lowering CO2, much higher costs for the aimed-at decarbonisation of power generation would have to be accepted.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "6fd0e85b98edd2042322927191ea2790f7771249", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3366079", "CorpusId": 239086068}, "title": "A Study on the Ccs Legal Framework in Japan", "abstract": "The Paris Agreement of 4 November 2016 for the first time brought all nations together to share the responsibility of combatting climate change and adapting to its effects.

Along with capture, it is equally important to ensure proper sinks for this captured CO2. As Bangladesh has no dedicated geological reservoir for CO2 storage, potential sink for captured CO2 could be immediate utilization after capture. This paper also presents preliminary results on utilizing CO2 through mineralization during preparation of alternative admixture and construction materials. Due to the ever-growing real-estate sector of Bangladesh, there is great potential in capturing and utilizing CO2 through construction activities.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "850b08c270ffd4d5436270da1ce37007b084a02c", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/mss/BigelowBBC10", "MAG": "2034218324", "DOI": "10.1109/MSST.2010.5496975", "CorpusId": 2116387}, "title": "Mahanaxar: Quality of service guarantees in high-bandwidth, real-time streaming data storage", "abstract": "Large radio telescopes, cyber-security systems monitoring real-time network traffic, and others have specialized data storage needs: guaranteed capture of an ultra-high-bandwidth data stream, retention of the data long enough to determine what is \u201cinteresting,\u201d retention of interesting data indefinitely, and concurrent read/write access to determine what data is interesting, without interrupting the ongoing capture of incoming data.

Integrating CO2-foam techniques with carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) operations is of recent interest, as the mobility control and sweep efficiency increases seen in EOR could also benefit CO2 storage during CCUS. In this study, a variety of different charge, hydrocarbon chain length, head group surfactants were evaluated by surface tension, bulk and dynamic CO2-foam performance assessments for CCUS. The optimal foam candidate was expected to provide satisfying mobility control effects under reservoir conditions, leading to an improved water displacement efficiency during CO2-foam flooding that favors a more significant CO2 storage potential. All tested surfactants were able to lower their surface tensions against scCO2 by 4-5 times, enlarging the surface area of solution/gas contact; therefore, more CO2 could be trapped in the foam system. A zwitterionic surfactant was found to have slightly higher surface tension against CO2 while exhibiting the highest foaming ability and the most prolonged foam stability with a relatively slower drainage rate among all tested surfactants. The dynamic performance of scCO2-foam stabilized by this zwitterionic surfactant was also evaluated in sandstone and carbonate cores at 13.79 MPa and 90\u00b0C. The results show that the mobility control development in carbonate core was relatively slower, suggesting a gradual foam generation process attributed to the higher permeability than the case in sandstone core. A more significant cumulative CO2 storage potential improvement, quantified based on the water production, was recorded in sandstone (53%) over the carbonate (47%). Overall, the selected foam has successfully developed CO2 mobility control and improved water displacement in the occurrence of in-situ foam generation, hence promoting the storage capacity for the injected CO2. This work has optimized the foaming agent selection method at the actual reservoir conditions and evaluated the scCO2-foam performance in establishing high flow resistance and improving the CO2 storage capacity, which benefits integrated CCUS studies or projects utilizing CO2-foam techniques.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "299103ff80518258df2160a1cf9f09b6c017d13d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2334753379", "DOI": "10.2514/6.2012-3718", "CorpusId": 139030862}, "title": "Effect of CO2 and H2O diluents on radiative heat release rates of Oxy-fuel flames", "abstract": "Oxy-fuel combustion is the burning of fuel (typically a hydrocarbon) in oxygen instead of air.

The primary trapping mechanisms are structural, residual, dissolution and mineralization. Knowledge gaps exist on how the heterogeneity of the formation manifested at all scales from the pore to the site scales affects trapping and parameterization of contributing mechanisms in models. An experimental and modeling study was conducted to fill these knowledge gaps. Experimental investigation of fundamental processes and mechanisms in field settings is not possible as it is not feasible to fully characterize the geologic heterogeneity at all relevant scales and gathering data on migration, trapping and dissolution of scCO2. Laboratory experiments using scCO2 under ambient conditions are also not feasible as it is technically challenging and cost prohibitive to develop large, two- or three-dimensional test systems with controlled high pressures to keep the scCO2 as a liquid.

However, thus far there is no robust technology to precisely measure the infiltration rate of walk-in coolers during the door opening period. Upon systematic and direct measurement of the infiltration rate, those operating conditions that could reduce the infiltration rate can be identified.

This national binding target would force EU Member State to develop specific strategies and new policy measures. It is general consensus that energy and transport sectors are major contributors to the global CO2 emissions registered in EU and worldwide, to this end, much more should be done to support biobased power generation at large scale, also forcing the introduction of CO2 capture and storage and for GHG emission reduction, by introducing new technologies and improve national incentive schemes. One of the most interesting practices is represented by carbon capture, storage (CCS) and reutilisation (CCU) technologies; unfortunately, due to the high cost of CO2 separation and the lack of incentives available, CCS is not yet economically viable for conventional mid-large scale power plants. At the same time, CO2 capture represents the key for the future sustainable development of bio-energy sector. Scope of this paper is to present the huge potentials of chemical looping combustion (CLC), a disruptive sustainable combustion technology, which has been investigated in the last 10 years mainly for fossil fuels, which is demonstrating to be very promising for bioenergy generation. Chemical Looping Combustion is an innovative combustion technology where the fuel does not get in contact with combustion air. The necessary oxygen for the oxidation reaction is transported from the air reactor two the fuel reactor via a solid oxygen carrier, consisting mainly in a wide range of metal oxides, avoiding the energy demanding gas-gas separation step inherently. Furthermore, this technology allows energy generation with no-NOx formation and producing almost pure CO2 and steam, facilitating the Carbon capture and thus largely improving the overall sustainability of the combustion process. The application of Biomass as fuel is not yet developed, but thanks to the specific properties of biomass feedstock, the Biomass chemical looping combustion presents valuable aspects both in terms of environmental sustainability and technoeconomic feasibility. EUBIA, in cooperation with industries and universities, is working to bring this technology to industrial scale, with the aim to move European bioenergy sector towards a cleaner future development.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "c8227070133c01ba3b69a726f6efa57407a400c1", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3365634", "CorpusId": 115152742}, "title": "Estimating the Potential of Pre-combustion CO 2 Capture in Bio-hydrogen , Bio-CNG and Bioethanol Production Plants", "abstract": "1.0 Introduction and motivation Primary energy demand in India is projected to soar from 775 Mtoe in 2013 to 1900 Mtoe in 2040 [1]. Coal remains the main source of energy for India accounting for 44% of the total primary energy consumption in 2013 [1] and hence is the main cause for greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and thus Climate Change. Renewable energy sources are the possible solution to mitigate GHG emissions. Biomass, accounting for 24% of India\u2019s energy consumption [1], can play a vital role in meeting the rapid energy demand while promising zero GHG emissions. Integration of carbon capture and storage with bio-energy pathway (BECCS) can even achieve negative emissions, which would become necessary in the coming years for achieving the GHG stabilization targets. BECCS has the potential to remove 10 billion tonnes of CO2 from the atmosphere every year by 2050 which is equivalent to a third of all current global energy-related emissions [2]. However, in India, majority of the biomass and bio-energy products are consumed in a decentralized manner which makes it difficult and even unrealistic to go for post-combustion CO2 capture with a bioenergy pathway. Considerable amount of CO2 is released in the process of producing bio-energy products such as bio-hydrogen (produced via biomass gasification), bio-CNG and bio-ethanol. This pre-combustion CO2 can be captured and offers an opportunity to achieve negative GHG emissions.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "41b10f2d7af7c30a5d0546d57e2af67ab4804327", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2915219727", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.04058.x", "CorpusId": 29353531, "PubMed": "19845879"}, "title": "The 2-oxoglutarate/malate translocator mediates amino acid and storage protein biosynthesis in pea embryos.", "abstract": "Heterotrophic plastids of seeds perform many biosynthetic reactions. Understanding their function in crop plants is crucial for seed production. Physiological functions depend on the uptake of precursors by a range of different metabolite translocators. The 2-oxoglutarate/malate translocator gene (PsOMT), which is highly expressed during pea (Pisum sativum) embryo maturation, has an important role during seed storage. PsOMT functions have been studied by antisense repression in maturing pea embryos, and were found to reduce mRNA levels and transport rates of 2-oxoglutarate and malate by 50-70%. Combined metabolite and transcript profiling revealed that OMT repression affects the conversion of carbohydrates from sucrose into amino acids and proteins, decreases seed weight and delays maturation. OMT-repressed pea embryos have increased levels of organic acids, ammonia, and higher ratios of Asn : Asp and Gln : Glu. Decreased levels of most other amino acids indicate the reduced usage of organic acids and ammonia for amino acid biosynthesis in plastids, possibly caused by substrate limitation of the plastidial glutamine synthetase/glutamine-2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase cycle. Expression of storage proteins is delayed, and mature seeds have reduced protein content. Downregulated gene expression of starch biosynthesis and plastidial glucose-6-phosphate transport in asOMT embryos reveals that decreased 2-oxoglutarate/malate transport capacity affects other pathways of central carbon metabolism. Gene expression analysis related to plastid physiology revealed that OMT repression delays differentiation of storage plastids, thereby maintaining gene expression associated with green chloroplasts. We conclude that OMT is important for protein-storing crop seeds, and is necessary for amino acid biosynthesis in pea seeds. In addition, carbon supply as mediated by OMT controls plastid differentiation during seed maturation.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "e82ecd860a76d33e0c06594c603a5d0da0abf781", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2993090621", "DOI": "10.1002/est2.116", "CorpusId": 214521561}, "title": "Improving clean energy greenhouse heating with solar thermal energy storage and phase change materials", "abstract": "Greenhouses consume a great deal of energy to heat their building envelopes.

The carbon capture, utilization, and storage technical section (CCUS-TS) of the SPE agreed to lead this effort. This group represents companies, governments, national labs, consulting firms, research institutes, and academia. To benefit from the experience in developing and using the PRMS, several individuals with recognized oil and gas classification expertise were recruited to the SRMS committee.<br><br>The SRMS classification of a storage quantity is project based, which means that a higher degree of certainty of a geologic formation being used for storage is completely dependent on the certainty that the injection project will be funded through site screening, selection, and active injection. The premise is that the highest classification of confidence in an estimate of storage is from active CO2 injection. The broadest two classifications, Discovered and Undiscovered Storage Resources, are based on data available. Discovered Storage Resources require the presence of a wellbore with adequate data to assess a geologic formation for storage, which includes CO2 containment potential. Undiscovered Storage Resources are entirely exploratory and do not require a wellbore.

The primary difference is that the project associated with the storage quantity classified as Contingent Storage Resources is temporarily not expected to move forward until one or more contingencies have been overcome. Examples of contingencies are issuance of an injection permit, final financial commitment (e.g. from a bank, government, or company), or completion of a pipeline.

If only!", "abstract": "Myhrvold and Caldeira worked out the climate consequences of various ways in which the world's current fleet of coal power plants could evolve into something different [1]. They imagined one-fortieth of the world's coal plants being closed down each year for 40 years. Two limiting cases are (1) nothing is built to take the place of this power, because efficiency gains have made them unnecessary, and (2) coal plants exactly like those now running take their place. Since coal power is the most carbon-intensive form of power, all other options fall between these limits. They looked at six single-technology alternatives: taking over from coal as we know it are coal with carbon dioxide capture and storage, natural gas, nuclear power and three forms of intermittent renewables (presented as baseload options). Moreover, whatever the alternative, it remains in place unchanged from year 40 through year 100. Results are presented as 100 yr trajectories for the increment in the average global surface temperature due only to this power production. For the coal-for-coal scenario, the surface temperature increase is about 0.13 \u00b0C in 40 yr and 0.31 \u00b0C in 100 yr. For the efficiency-for-coal scenario, the rise is 0.07 \u00b0C in 40 yr and 0.06 \u00b0C in 100 yr. Clearly, temperature rise is approximately proportional to emissions and these are self-consistent answers. For example, after 40 yr efficiency-for-coal has brought approximately half the temperature rise of coal-for-coal, and there have been exactly half the emissions. The efficiency-for-coal trajectory falls ever so slightly between years 40 and 100, because once CO2 enters the atmosphere it lingers. As for the absolute magnitude of the coal-to-coal trajectory, today's global coal power production (8300 TWh in 2008) is almost exactly what would be produced from one thousand one-gigawatt coal plants running flat out (8760 TWh), which is the coal power production assumed by Myhrvold and Caldeira. From table S1 of their paper, each GW-year of coal power production is accompanied by 6.59 Mt of CO2 emissions. Thus, a century of this coal will emit 659 billion tons of CO2. A rule of thumb recently promoted associates each trillion tons of carbon emissions (each 3.7 trillion tons of CO2 emissions) with a long-term temperature rise whose fifth and 95th per cent confidence intervals are 1.0 and 2.1 \u00b0C [2]. With this rule of thumb, the long-term temperature rise should fall between 0.18 and 0.38 \u00b0C, so the estimated rise of 0.31 \u00b0C agrees with the rule of thumb. Much of the paper is about estimates of the emissions for the alternatives to coal and efficiency. Emissions are estimated for building the physical stock as well as running it. The authors cite a high and a low value for each alternative, and the lower limits, with one exception, are close to what most analysis assumes. (The exception is natural gas, whose lower limit is 60% of the value for coal, even though values of 50% or lower are widely claimed.) The high limits are unorthodox and are already creating consternation. The high limit for hydropower reflects large emissions of methane from the lakes that form behind dams. In the cases of nuclear power, solar electric power, solar thermal power and wind power, the high limits can be attributed to emissions during construction. One suspects that these high values are straw men, avoidable with care. It is illuminating to compare the Myhrvold\u2013Caldeira partial emissions scenarios with the two full blown scenarios of the International Energy Agency (IEA)\u2014the Current Policy Scenario and the 450 Scenario, presented in World Energy Outlook 2010 [3]. Both IEA scenarios go only to 2035. In the Current Policies Scenario, coal emissions approximately double by 2035 (to 16 500 TWh); Myhrvold and Caldeira actually do not tell us that this is where global coal power is heading, in the absence of new policies and priorities. As for the IEA's 450 Scenario, it provides insight into the 40 yr phase-out for global coal power chosen by Myhrvold and Caldeira as their base case. In the 450 Scenario, global coal power falls to 5600 TWh in 2035, down one third from its 2008 value. By contrast, the pace for coal phase-out explored in the Myhrvold and Caldeira paper is about twice as fast: if their 40 yr phase-out had started in 2008, by 2035\u201427 yr later\u2014global coal production would have fallen by about two thirds. I think one can view the 450 Scenario as capturing the IEA's judgment about the fastest achievable decarbonization of the world energy system. It is sobering to realize that allowing 40 yr for the closing out of world coal power production, which might strike some readers as relaxed, is actually so intense as to stretch credibility. The IEA 450 Scenario also sheds light on the small fraction of the potential change in the future of the global energy system that the Myhrvold\u2013Caldeira paper captures. The 2700 TWh reduction in coal power production between 2008 and 2035 in the 450 Scenario is smaller in magnitude than the increases in wind power (3900 TWh), nuclear power (3700 TWh), and hydropower (2800 TWh) in the same interval. Myhrvold and Caldeira present a textbook exercise, not to be confused with an exploration of the full range of possible futures. I would not recommend this paper for its insight into energy systems. Rather, I would recommend it, strongly, as one of the rare papers that adequately confronts both of the sources of inertia that characterize our world: the inertia of the climate system epitomized by the durability of atmospheric CO2 and the inertia of the energy system epitomized by the durability of our capital stock. Confronting this inertia can lead us to despair that what we can change for the better each year matters so little. Or it can inspire us, because what we do each year that points in the wrong direction will take so long to undo.

The results showed that C storage in China's forest ecosystems ranged from 30.99 to 34.96 Pg C by the six integrative methods. We detected 5.0% variation (coefficient of variation, CV, %) among the six methods, which was influenced mainly by soil C estimates.

Dead mass C density and storage were estimated to be 3.66\u20135.41 Mg C\u00b7ha\u22121 and 0.68\u20130.82 Pg C, respectively. Mean C storage in China's forest ecosystems estimated by the six integrative methods was 8.557 Pg C (25.8%) for aboveground biomass, 1.950 Pg C (5.9%) for belowground biomass, 0.697 Pg C (2.1%) for dead mass, and 21.958 Pg C (66.2%) for soil organic C in the 0\u2013100 cm soil layer. The R:S ratio was 0.23, and C storage in the soil was 2.1 times greater than in the vegetation. Carbon storage estimates with respect to forest type classification (38 forest subtypes) were closer to the average value than those calculated using the spatial interpolation methods.

It is shown that access to infrastructures that can facilitate CO2 abatement varies significantly across countries and between individual refineries. The assessment shows that short-term mitigation options, i.e., fuel substitution and energy efficiency measures, could reduce CO2 emissions by 9-40 MtCO2/year (6-26% of the total refinery emissions).

CO2 foam injection involves injecting a foaming agent (surfactant) with CO2 to generate stable foams in porous media. This work presents an incremental physical upscaling approach that moves from the pore- to core- to field-scale for characterizing and optimizing foam systems for CO2 mobility control, EOR, and CO2 storage. An additional focus was to visualize and describe in-situ fluid saturation dynamics during CO2 storage processes. We address the challenges associated with transferring CO2 foam EOR technology offshore, using lessons learned from an ongoing onshore pilot in the Permian Basin of west Texas. The aim is to encourage co-optimized CO2 EOR and long-term CO2 storage foam technology as part of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) for offshore applications.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "9de4b5d5843a89287df83dd530df4b1d5b221ac6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2140211022", "DOI": "10.1128/IAI.00871-10", "CorpusId": 7410438, "PubMed": "21173314"}, "title": "Inactivation of bb0184, Which Encodes Carbon Storage Regulator A, Represses the Infectivity of Borrelia burgdorferi", "abstract": "ABSTRACT The genome of Borrelia burgdorferi, the Lyme disease spirochete, encodes a homolog (the bb0184 gene product) of the carbon storage regulator A protein (CsrABb); recent studies reported that CsrABb is involved in the regulation of several infectivity factors of B. burgdorferi. However, the mechanism involved remains unknown. In this report, a csrABb mutant was constructed and complemented in an infectious B31A3 strain. Subsequent animal studies showed that the mutant failed to establish an infection in mice, highlighting that CsrABb is required for the infectivity of B. burgdorferi. Western blot analyses revealed that the virulence-associated factors OspC, DbpB, and DbpA were attenuated in the csrABb mutant. The Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway (\u03c354-\u03c3S sigma factor cascade) is a central regulon that governs the expression of ospC, dbpB, and dbpA. Further analyses found that the level of RpoS was significantly decreased in the mutant, while the level of Rrp2 remained unchanged. A recent study reported that the overexpression of BB0589, a phosphate acetyl-transferase (Pta) that converts acetyl-phosphate to acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA), led to the inhibition of RpoS and OspC expression, suggesting that acetyl-phosphate is an activator of Rrp2. Along with this report, we found that CsrABb binds to the leader sequence of the bb0589 transcript and that the intracellular level of acetyl-CoA in the csrABb mutant was significantly increased compared to that of the wild type, suggesting that more acetyl-phosphate was being converted to acetyl-CoA in the mutant. Collectively, these results suggest that CsrABb may influence the infectivity of B. burgdorferi via regulation of acetate metabolism and subsequent activation of the Rrp2-RpoN-RpoS pathway.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "1002399b06af2b7a95f2a5d94f516fd368ec1e3e", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s10584-021-03170-5", "CorpusId": 236901536}, "title": "Achieving negative emissions through oceanic sequestration of vegetation carbon as Black Pellets", "abstract": "Natural processes and human activities produce vast amounts of dead vegetation which return CO2 to the atmosphere through decay and combustion. If such vegetation could be converted into biocoal and sequestered on the ocean floor, it could reduce the accumulation of atmospheric CO2 without involving sequestration in the form of CO2. Given that raw vegetation is unsuitable for large-scale energy applications, a process was developed to convert raw vegetation into a form of biocoal, termed Black Pellets, that solves the logistical and energy conversion problems of using raw vegetation for power generation. Seemingly overlooked is that properties of Black Pellets\u2014higher density than seawater and resistance to microbial decay\u2014may offer an environmentally safe way of sequestering vegetation carbon on the sea floor. Sequestering vegetation carbon by depositing biocoal as Black Pellets in the deep ocean (oceanic sequestration of biocoal\u2014OSB) would be a means of achieving long-lasting negative emissions. Sacrificing the energy content of the deposited pellets would require substituting energy from other sources. If the substitute energy could be from lower-carbon natural gas or carbon-free sources, the effects would be less accumulation of atmospheric CO2 compared to using the pellets for energy and a nearly 60 to 100% reduction in the need for geologic sequestration compared to bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS). If confirmed by research, OSB would be an addition to the sparse toolbox of negative emission technologies (NETs) which would give humankind more flexibility in meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "e2528a88c634b6add792864d6aae31250826bc1e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2896244478", "DOI": "10.1086/701069", "CorpusId": 53750214, "PubMed": "30481115"}, "title": "Handling Stress and Sample Storage Are Associated with Weaker Complement-Mediated Bactericidal Ability in Birds but Not Bats", "abstract": "Variation in immune defense influences infectious disease dynamics within and among species. Understanding how variation in immunity drives pathogen transmission among species is especially important for animals that are reservoir hosts for zoonotic pathogens. Bats, in particular, have a propensity to host serious viral zoonoses without developing clinical disease themselves. The immunological adaptations that allow bats to host viruses without disease may be related to their adaptations for flight (e.g., in metabolism and mediation of oxidative stress). A number of analyses report greater richness of zoonotic pathogens in bats than in other taxa, such as birds (i.e., mostly volant vertebrates) and rodents (i.e., nonvolant small mammals), but immunological comparisons between bats and these other taxa are rare. To examine interspecific differences in bacterial killing ability (BKA), a functional measure of overall constitutive innate immunity, we use a phylogenetic meta-analysis to compare how BKA responds to the acute stress of capture and to storage time of frozen samples across the orders Aves and Chiroptera. After adjusting for host phylogeny, sample size, and total microbe colony-forming units, we find preliminary evidence that the constitutive innate immune defense of bats may be more resilient to handling stress and storage time than that of birds. This pattern was also similar when we analyzed the proportion of nonnegative and positive effect sizes per species, using phylogenetic comparative methods. We discuss potential physiological and evolutionary mechanisms by which complement proteins may differ between species orders and suggest future avenues for comparative field studies of immunity

Adipose samples from large datasets of capture biopsied, remote biopsied, and harvested polar bears were used to validate adipose lipid content as a CI via tests of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, biopsy depth, and storage conditions and comparisons to established CIs, to measures of health and to demographic and ecological parameters. The lipid content analyses of even very small biopsy samples were highly accurate and precise, but results were influenced by tissue depth at which the sample was taken. Lipid content of capture biopsies and samples from harvested adult females was correlated with established CIs and/or conformed to expected biological variation and ecological changes. However, lipid content of remote biopsies was lower than capture biopsies and harvested samples, possibly due to lipid loss during dart retrieval. Lipid content CI is a biologically relevant, relatively inexpensive and rapidly assessed CI and can be determined routinely for individuals and populations in order to infer large-scale spatial and long-term temporal trends.

Produced for the National Bicentennial celebration, the recording reflects the character and history of Annapolis, Maryland, and faithfully captures a wide range of performances of music from sea chanteys like Down Among the Dead Men to liturgical music such as Ava Maria. Nearly thirty years later, the Annapolis Sounds master tapes were needed for a new CD edition for the. Annapolis Tercentennial. Unfortunately, the tapes (Ampex 406 with carbon black back-coating) had severe Sticky Shed Syndrome and were virtually unplayable. Although others were baking Sticky Shed tapes, we desired a safer and more permanent treatment that would provide a superb playback and preserve tapes for future re-use without additional treatment. After several years of careful experimentation and research, based on Edward F. Cuddihy's chemical research at National Aeronautics & Space Administration's (NASA's) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (1976-1982) and backed by forensic chemists, we devised a new harmless conservation alternative to the baking method. Many now admit that the baking method is simply expedient, trading a quick-fix and mediocre playback for permanent damage to the tape. Baked tapes require even longer repeated baking treatments, until they eventually are destroyed by heat energy consequences. Despite the high humidity and hot summer temperatures of the Annapolis environment, the new process safely and gently restored the Annapolis Sounds tapes to superb condition. Not only was the full sonic fidelity of the original recorded sound obtained for the CD, but the physical and chemical integrity of the tapes was preserved. This article explains how Sticky Shed Syndrome occurs, why baking or lubricating tapes is unnecessary and harmful, and how the new process restores and preserves Sticky Shed tapes like Annapolis Sounds. Perfect playback fidelity of an original recording can be achieved and tapes restored for a long life span versus an inferior migration copy from a, potentially final, playback of a baked Sticky Shed tape. Introduction & Background In 2006, faced with the severely sticky Annapolis Sounds masters, Richardson Records confronted the dilemma that many tape owners now face: how to diagnose and treat Sticky Shed Syndrome in magnetic recording tapes. If the tape's condition is correctly diagnosed and well understood, proper treatment may prove beneficial to both playback and future playability. Unfortunately when an ailment is misunderstood, misdiagnosis and mistreatment often occurs. It is commonly believed that Sticky Shed Syndrome is an incurable problem that reduces the useful life of most tapes to ten years or less. Sticky Shed threatens an estimated 40-50 million hours of audio, video and data tapes made since 1970 (Schuller, Kranner, 2002). Because of Sticky Shed's reputation as incurable, many of the quick fix solutions offered for Sticky Shed problems are intended to merely facilitate tape playback, rather than treat the tape's chemical conditions in a way that will provide a long life and numerous playbacks. Merely facilitating a single or final playback is not a satisfactory solution. The Annapolis Sounds masters have already provided material for several albums and held the promise for more. In addition, analog magnetic tape recordings produce a depth and richness of sound that most digital recordings cannot rival. Many Sticky Shed solutions ignore tape handling and storage standards. These solutions rely on misinterpretations of early Sticky Shed research by Edward F. Cuddihy, a chemist for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), to rationalize the permanent damage these methods can cause. Rather than risk the loss of masters by forcing a playback, studies and tests described in this article were undertaken to identify solutions that prepare tapes for both excellent playbacks, as well as a long and useful lives. \u2026", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "3114a7589241dd2df386f6db9c0fc72b27c9dd0a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2036840933", "DOI": "10.1007/BF01808273", "CorpusId": 36816424}, "title": "Origins of life: An operational definition", "abstract": "Two very different models are used for the scientific study of life's origins: in the Troland-Muller model, life is molecular and its defining characteristic is gene function; in the Oparin-Haldane model, life is cellular and its defining characteristic is metabolic function.

In principle, it could be used to remove sufficient CO 2 from the atmosphere to compensate for hard-to-decarbonize sectors, such as aviation, or even for polishing gas streams containing relatively low CO 2 concentrations. In this paper, the performance of lime-based sorbents for CO 2 capture from air in a fixed bed was investigated. The effects of sorbent type, particle diameter, air flow rate, and relative humidity on the breakthrough time, breakthrough shape, and global reaction rate over a series of capture and regeneration cycles were examined. The greatest reaction rates and conversions were obtained when the sorbents were pre-hydrated and inlet air was humidified to 55% relative humidity. Humidifying the air alone leads to axial carbonation gradients since there is competition between CO 2 and water with the available CaO. Negligible conversion, over the duration of the experiment, is obtained in a dry system without pre-hydration and humid air. A shrinking-core gas\u2013solid reaction model was fitted to the breakthrough curves in order to estimate the surface reaction and effective diffusion constants. Although the surface reaction constants of the two sorbents were similar, the pelletized limestone had a greater effective diffusivity due to its greater porosity. At mild calcination conditions with air at 850\u00a0\u00b0C, the pelletized particles maintained their activity over nine carbonation\u2013calcination cycles with a conversion drop of only 9% points. However, calcination under oxy-fuel conditions (CO 2 at 920\u00a0\u00b0C) reduced the pellet carbonation conversion from 81 to 59% and pore surface area from 12.01 to 3.20\u00a0m 2 /g after only 4\u00a0cycles. This research clearly shows that DAC using lime-based sorbents is technically feasible, and that regeneration schemes compatible with technologies like calcium looping (CaL) are applicable for the air capture option.

The International Energy Agency\u2019s (IEA) 2017 Energy Technology Perspectives indicates that CCUS (noted as just CCS) is vital in both their 2\u00b0C Scenario (2DS) and Beyond 2\u00b0C Scenario (B2DS) to decrease CO2 emissions [4]. However, deploying CCUS at the volume projected by the IEA would require more CCUS infrastructure and technology deployment than what currently exists today [4]. Furthermore, organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, and the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), among others, have all strongly endorsed CCUS technologies as part of the solution to reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions [5]. While several smalland large-scale CCUS projects have deployed throughout the world that have demonstrated that significant CO2 emissions reductions are capable, broader CCUS deployment still faces challenges pertaining to cost effectiveness, regulations, and financing [6, 7]. In the United States specifically, widespread deployment of CCUS may depend on a combination of stable economic incentives and continued research and development (R&D) advancements to make the technology economical [8]. Assessing how to meet stringent federal and state-driven regulations and taking advantage of emerging financial incentives (like the modified 45Q tax credit and updated corporate tax structures) is a challenge that current and future CCUS site operations face [8, 9]. Attaining realistic costs for implementing CCUS requires further understanding of the specific cost drivers associated with each link of the CCUS value chain (i.e., capture, transport, and storage). The U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) has analyzed several of the more prominent challenges inhibiting broader CCUS deployment using NETLdeveloped resources that estimate critical cost drivers associated with CCUS (specifically cost drivers related to CO2 capture, CO2 transport, and CO2 storage). This paper features the results of these analyses, which provide perspective surrounding the economics associated with overcoming CCUS deployment challenges and assess the cost drivers that impact the entire CCUS value chain.

Much research has already focused on the issue of how to facilitate implementation of CCS technology. This paper reviews recent studies on the efficiency penalty of coal-fired power plants with CCS. Efficiency penalty, which represents a net decrease in the power efficiency caused by the CO2\u00a0capture and compression process, can be estimated using process simulation that considers factors such as the power generation steam cycle, coal type, and CO2\u00a0capture and compression process. According to previous research, the efficiency penalty for current applications was about 10%. The ratio of efficiency penalty caused by CO2\u00a0capture to the total efficiency penalty was about two thirds. It appears that while the types of power plant and coal had little influence on efficiency penalty, the CO2\u00a0capture technology was critically important. By reducing the regeneration energy of the CO2\u00a0scrubbing solvent by 1 GJ/t-CO2, an approximate 2% efficiency improvement can be expected.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "4535cb468620aa31ee09018ffe6581853b42afda", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "6369669", "MAG": "2895913216", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpcc.8b08639", "CorpusId": 61807831, "PubMed": "30774742"}, "title": "Polarizable Force Field for CO2 in M-MOF-74 Derived from Quantum Mechanics", "abstract": "On the short term, carbon capture is a viable solution to reduce human-induced CO2 emissions, which requires an energy efficient separation of CO2. Metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) may offer opportunities for carbon capture and other industrially relevant separations. Especially, MOFs with embedded open metal sites have been shown to be promising. Molecular simulation is a useful tool to predict the performance of MOFs even before the synthesis of the material. This reduces the experimental effort, and the selection process of the most suitable MOF for a particular application can be accelerated. To describe the interactions between open metal sites and guest molecules in molecular simulation is challenging. Polarizable force fields have potential to improve the description of such specific interactions. Previously, we tested the applicability of polarizable force fields for CO2 in M-MOF-74 by verifying the ability to reproduce experimental measurements. Here, we develop a predictive polarizable force field for CO2 in M-MOF-74 (M = Co, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn) without the requirement of experimental data. The force field is derived from energies predicted from quantum mechanics. The procedure is easily transferable to other MOFs. To incorporate explicit polarization, the induced dipole method is applied between the framework and the guest molecule. Atomic polarizabilities are assigned according to the literature. Only the Lennard-Jones parameters of the open metal sites are parameterized to reproduce energies from quantum mechanics.

At the heart of this efficient integration lies the need to plan for and exploit the available flexibility in power systems. Flexibility is a relatively new concept addressing the issue of increased variability and uncertainty in power systems admitting high penetration levels of renewable energy sources. To that end, we previously introduced the concept of flexible power envelopes to capture flexibility requirements and flexibility availability from power system resources in terms of time-constrained power deployment. Here, we extend this concept to flexible energy envelopes, thus giving rise to the notion of flexibility assessment in terms of time-constrained energy deployment. This approach is more appropriate for considering flexibility resources like energy storage and demand response.

PCC plant operators can modify capture plant process variables to adjust the CO2 capture level to a value which is optimal for current fuel cost, electricity selling price and CO2 emissions costs, increasing short-term profitability. Additionally, variation of the level of steam extraction from the generation plant can allow the capture facility to provide additional operating flexibility for coal-fired power stations which are comparatively slow to change output. A pilot-scale test campaign investigates the response of plant operating parameters to dynamic scenarios which are designed to be representative of pulverised coal plant operation. Online sensors continuously monitor changes in rich and lean solvent CO2 loading (30%wt monoethanolamine). Solvent loading is likely to be a critical control variable for the optimisation of flexible PCC operation, and since economic and operational boundaries can change on timescales 30min or shorter, the development of methods for rapid, continuous online solvent analysis is key. Seven dynamic datasets are produced and insights about plant response times and hydrodynamics are provided. These include power output maximisation, frequency response, power output ramping and a comparison between two plant start-up strategies. In the final dynamic operating scenario, control of CO2 capture efficiency for a simple reboiler steam decoupling and reintroduction event is demonstrated using only knowledge of plant hydrodynamics and continuous measurement of solvent lean loading. Hot water flow to the reboiler is reduced to drop the capture efficiency. The \u201ctarget\u201d value for the minimum capture efficiency in the scenario was set at 30%, but a minimum CO2 capture efficiency of 26.4% was achieved. While there remains scope for improvement this represents a significant practical step towards the control of capture plant using online solvent concentration and CO2 measurements, and the next steps for its further development are discussed.", "year": 2018}]}
