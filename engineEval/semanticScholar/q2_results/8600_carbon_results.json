Carbon dioxide (CO2), one of the greenhouse gases, has been nominated as the main culprit of this international concern (UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY, 1997). The carbon capture and storage (CCS) technique is grabbing attention because the current energy paradigm that focuses on fossil fuel cannot be changed abruptly. However, CO2 geological sequestration faces difficulties related to non-homogeneous underground conditions, poorly characterized interconnected geo-systems, and complex hydro-chemo-mechanical effects that involve reservoir rock and cap-rock mineralogy, saturating fluid, and injected fluid. Thus, it is considered as risky and uncertain, and there is the possibility of CO2 leakage. For monitoring CO2 storage sites, use of geophysical tomography methods has been studied (ARTS et al., 2000). CO2 gas migration due to storage or leakage changes the resistivity of the medium, and it can be monitored through resistivity tomography (NAKATSUKA et al., 2010). If a resistivity survey can catch the complex phenomena caused by subsurface CO2 leakage, it should be considered as a concrete option for monitoring CO2 storage sites. In this study, we developed a unique laboratory facility for observing the evolution of subsurface CO2 leakage. And we attached a resistivity measurement system based on borehole resistivity tomography. We attempted to get resistivity images when the phenomena related to CO2 leakage were taking place in the tank. These images were compared with the timelapsed photos and we analyze and discuss the applicability of the resistivity survey.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "c9e2be08ab9793cc2bfc2a371a79d1bebd63d24e", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 234756986}, "title": "Carbon Storage Estimation In Mangrove Sediment At Payung Island, South Sumatra", "abstract": "Mangrove is a plant generally located in tropical regions.

In order to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere, procedures such as carbon dioxide capture and storage are currently being implemented, although this process is successful in decreasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration it results in the mindless storage of an otherwise synthetically useful reagent. The development of a viable method to capture carbon dioxide, followed by synthetic utilisation often referred to as CCU is currently gaining much attention. The main challenges in the development of a suitable utilisation reaction are energy and cost efficiency as well as the use of environmentally friendly conditions. \n\nPrevious reports on utilisation include the catalytic incorporation of carbon dioxide into epoxides under electrochemical conditions, however this process had several drawbacks. In this project the shortcomings of this reported procedure have been addressed in order to develop a potentially viable utilisation process. The catalyst free electrocarboxylation of mono-substituted epoxides, using a magnesium anode/copper cathode electrode couple and tetrabutylammonium bromide supporting electrolyte in a sealed single compartment cell, was achieved under mild reaction conditions (1 atmosphere carbon dioxide pressure, 60 milliamperes constant current and 50 degree celsius heating), producing the corresponding 5-membered cyclic carbonate product in excellent yields (65-96%). Interestingly the use of sono-electrolysis allowed the reduction of para-substituted aromatic epoxides. The stoichiometric addition of tetrabutylammonium bromide was key for the effective activation of carbon dioxide and the epoxide. Similar carbon dioxide incorporation into analogous mono-substituted aziridines, synthesised using a modified Wenker synthesis allowed the formation of the corresponding cyclic carbamates in moderate to excellent yields (32-90%). The selective synthesis of 6-membered cyclic carbonates from oxetane substrates was also achieved in good yields (60-70%) as well the non-selective synthesis of polytrimethylene oxide. The electrochemical process also allowed the tandem formation of magnesium carbonate in quantitative yield (85%). Furthermore substrate free electrocarboxylation allowed the synthesis of alternative iron and zinc carbonates in excellent yield (83-85%) as well as the selective synthesis of aluminium oxalate (99%).

Carbon sequestration involves the capture of CO 2 generated by the combustion of fossil fuels and placement of the carbon into longterm storage. (Power plants emit more than one-third of the global emissions of CO 2 .) One method of reducing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations would be the injection of CO 2 into the subsurface (geologic sequestration). The Gulf Coast Carbon Center envisions the Gulf Coast region becoming a major site, perhaps the nation\u2019s predominant site, for a new carbon sequestration industry. The economic engine that would power the development of this industry would be CO 2 -based enhanced oil recovery. The Texas Bureau of Economic Geology has estimated that, excluding the Permian Basin, over 5.7 billion barrels of oil could be recovered in Texas by CO 2 EOR technology. This production could pay for the construction of CO 2 capture plants, regional CO 2 pipelines and compression facilities that later could be used for putting CO 2 into long-term storage in deep brine aquifers in the Gulf Coast. Chemical plants and fossil fuel gasification units currently being planned for the Gulf Coast area are potential sources of relatively cheap CO 2 .

Enthalpies of CO2 adsorption (\u0394H\u00b0ads) of -21.7 and -21.0 kcal mol were obtained for primary diamine (1\u00b0-SBA) and secondary diamine (2\u00b0-SBA) functionalized material, respectively.

Introduction Global annual energy-related CO2 emissions reached a record high of 31.2 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2012[1], and are expected to rise continuously given the growing energy demands and widespread reliance on fossil fuel energy infrastructure. The mitigation of CO2 emission has been recognized as a crucial necessity, as CO2 is a major contributing greenhouse gas correlated to the negative effects of global warming, including sea level rise, significant variation in weather patterns, and threats to human health and wildlife habitats[2]. This has motivated research of post-combustion CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies, targeted at large point source emitters of CO2 such as coal fired power plants. Absorption with aqueous solutions of amines remains the benchmark approach at scale, but wide spread implementation is currently prohibited by the high energetic cost of sorbent regeneration, chiefly due to water vaporization. Translation of nitrogen based sorbents to porous solid supports is therefore an ongoing area of research. Background Carbon Capture The state-of-the-art technology for CO2 capture, aqueous amine scrubbing[3], has yet to be proven practical at scale due to considerable energy penalties of regeneration (ca. 50 kcal mol) [4], chiefly due to the vaporization of liquid water [5-8]. Solid-state postcombustion CO2 sorbents have certain advantages over traditional aqueous amine systems, such as relatively low regeneration energy requirements [8, 9], tunable pore morphology [10-13], and chemical variability through heteroatom doping or surface functionalization[14]. A variety of materials have been investigated for CO2 capture, including zeolites, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), porous carbons, porous silicas, and porous polymers[9, 15-20]. Nevertheless, it remains a significant challenge to achieve scalable sorbents that meet all of the requirements for CO2 capture, i.e., fast kinetics, high CO2 capacity and selectivity, mild regeneration conditions, and multicycle stability. For example, while chemisorbents like porous solid-supported amines may achieve excellent equilibrium adsorption capacities and CO2/N2 selectivities through chemical reactions with CO2[9, 21, 22], materials often require relatively high regeneration temperatures and long adsorption/desorption cycle times[9]. On the other hand, typical physisorbents, such as activated carbons and MOFs, can be regenerated with minimal energy input, yet have relatively low capacities under post-combustion conditions because of weak CO2-sorbent interactions and competing adsorption of other flue gas components, like N2 and H2O[8, 9] Nitrogen-Doped Porous Carbon Materials Ordered N-doped mesoporous carbons have attracted considerable attention in the application of CO2 capture owing to their high surface area, tunable pore structure, narrow pore size distribution, high N weight percentages, and mechanical, thermal, and electric properties. Typically, N-doped mesoporous carbons are prepared by a nanocasting method using a sacrificial template like porous silica. Nitrogen functionality can be incorporated by impregnation with nitrogen-containing organic molecules, followed by carbonization and removal of the silica template, or through post-synthesis treatment of mesoporous carbon using acetonitrile or ammonia chemical vapor deposition. These multiple-step processes are costly and time consuming. Other methods include the co-assembly of a nitrogen-containing monomer, melamine resin, urea-phenolformaldehyde resin, or dicyandiamide with a structural directing agent; however, the resulting porous polymers usually exhibit poor thermal stability. The decomposition process is further promoted by the high oxygen content within the triblock polymer. Development of reliable and facile strategies to synthesize N-doped mesoporous carbons without the use of a hard template is highly desirable. Carbons made by carbonization of polypyrrole possess graphitic structures and have high thermal conductivity that is desirable for heat transfer during adsorption and/or thermal regeneration. In this work, we report the successful synthesis of nitrogen-doped porous carbon using a modified-pyrrole monomer as the nitrogen source, which displays high CO2 capacity, high CO2/N2 selectivity, and facile regeneration. CO2 Sorption Thermodynamics A diverse range of solid CO2 sorbents have been studied, but emphasis is typically placed on maximizing the equilibrium CO2 capacities of materials. The thermodynamics of the adsorption/desorption process and, specifically, how the structure of sorbent molecules dictate the freeenergy of both CO2 adsorption and desorption reactions are not well understood. Mesoporous silicas are attractive solid supports due to their high surface areas, well-defined molecular-scale pore structures, and established synthetic and covalent modification procedures. By chemically altering the structure of amine sorbents and incorporating said sorbents onto the surface of ordered mesoporous silica, we have gained chemical level insights about the CO2 capture process and how amine structural perturbation effects the thermodynamics of the adsorption process (Scheme 1). Scheme 1. Changes to reaction free-energy with amine structural perturbation. Results Nitrogen-Doped Mesoporous Carbon A series of N-doped mesoporous activated carbons (SU-MAC-500, 600 and 800) have been synthesized, with surface areas ranging from 942 to 2369 m g, abundant ultrasmall microporosity (Figure 1), and various types of nitrogen functionalities (Figure 2). CO2 sorption capacity measurements were performed by pure gas adsorption, yielding values as high as 1.4 mmol g and 4.5 mmol g at 0.1 and 1 bar CO2, respectively (298 K) (Figure 3).

Functional group composition of plant communities, the source and magnitude of carbon inputs, and total ecosystem carbon storage displayed inconsistent responses to long-term livestock grazing along this gradient. C4 plants [primarily Bouteloua gracilis (H.B.K.) Lag ex Steud.] dominated the long-term grazed site in the shortgrass community, whereas the ungrazed site was co-dominated by C3 and C4 species; functional group composition did not differ between grazed and ungrazed sites in the mid- and tallgrass communities. Above-ground biomass was lower, but the relative proportion of fine root biomass was greater, in grazed compared to ungrazed sites at all three locations. The grazed site of the shortgrass community had 24% more whole-ecosystem carbon storage compared to the ungrazed site (4022 vs. 3236\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m\u22122). In contrast, grazed sites at the mid- and tallgrass communities had slightly lower (8%) whole-ecosystem carbon storage compared to ungrazed sites (midgrass: 7970 vs. 8683\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m\u22122; tallgrass: 8273 vs. 8997\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m\u22122). Differential responses between the shortgrass and the mid- and tallgrass communities with respect to grazing and whole-ecosystem carbon storage are likely a result of: (1) maintenance of larger soil organic carbon (SOC) pools in the mid- and tallgrass communities (7476\u20138280\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m\u22122) than the shortgrass community (2517\u20133307\u00a0g\u00a0C\u00a0m\u22122) that could potentially buffer ecosystem carbon fluxes, (2) lower root carbon/soil carbon ratios in the mid- and tallgrass communities (0.06\u20130.10) compared to the shortgrass community (0.20\u20130.27) suggesting that variation in root organic matter inputs would have relatively smaller effects on the size of the SOC pool, and (3) the absence of grazing-induced variation in the relative proportion of C3 and C4 functional groups in the mid- and tallgrass communities. We hypothesize that the magnitude and proportion of fine root mass within the upper soil profile is a principal driver mediating the effect of community composition on the biogeochemistry of these grassland ecosystems.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "aa059fcd8fa2729f67ff37324182b562c74caae8", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 67833938}, "title": "GHGT-11 Accurate thermodynamic-property models for CO 2-rich mixtures", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies result in demands on thermodynamic-property models that were previously unknown in energy technologies.

However, how many CO2 emission reductions are achieved by those companies using CCS technology is hard to say. There is almost no scholar concentrating on this field. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to study the importance of measurement and verification of CO2 emission reductions for the development of CCS projects in the future. By collecting and analyzing figures and articles, we find that the measurement and verification of CO2 emission reductions is very important. At the same time, this paper also finds some issues through analyzing the current status of measurement and verification of CO2 emission reductions in CCS projects in China. Besides, based on CCS technology advanced countries\u2019 experiences of developing measurement and verification of CO2 emission reduction, combined with the actual situation in China, suggestions are put forward on how to improve measurement and verification of CO2 emission reductions in China's CCS project.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF CCS IN CHINA Because of the fact that China will still use coal as the main source of energy for a long time, and responding to the global climate change is the inherent requirement and obligation of China's sustainable development, CCS technology has become the important technical path for China to fulfill the responsibility of controlling the climate change and meet the goal of reducing carbon emission. CCS(CO2 capture and storage technology)refers to the process of separating CO2 from emission sources of industrial or related energy industries, transporting and storing it into geological structures, and permanently isolating it from the atmosphere. Since the first CCS-EOR project has completed in the Jilin oilfield in 2007, China has made a lot of progress in many aspects related to CCS projects such as technology, policies, regulations, environment and economic support. A. The Number of Projects and the Scale of Investment The development of China\u2019s CCS project started late. The first CCS-EOR project was completed in 2007 in Jilin oil field. But this project has developed rapidly in recent years. By the end of 2017, there were 13 large integrated CCS projects in different stages of development or planning in China. In 2008, China built the CO2 capture demonstration project of Huaneng Beijing Gaobeidian thermal power plant, which is China's first flue gas CO2 capture demonstration project of coal-fired power plant. The cost of this project is 28. 5 Million Yuan, which is supported by the self-raised funds of Huaneng and the national science and technology program. It is estimated that the CO2 recovery rate is more than 85% and the annual capture capacity is 3000 tons. In December 2009, Huaneng Group\u2019s CCS demonstration project of Shanghai Shidongkou second power plant was officially launched. This project can capture 120 thousand tons of high purity CO2 per year. The huge capture capacity of this project shows that the CO2 capture \"demonstration\" project can be developed into \"scale\" project. In January 2010, China Electric Power Investment Group invested 12. 35 million Yuan to Chongqing Hechuan shuanghuai power plant. This project is the first ton class carbon capture device of coal-fired power plant in China, which can capture 10000 tons of high purity CO2 per year. In June 2010, China\u2019s Shenhua Group set up a demonstration project of CO2 capture and storage in Ordos, Inner Mongolia. This project is the first full-chain CO2 capture and storage industrial demonstration project in China. It is the largest CCS project in Asia, which is mainly to store CO2 in salty water layer. The total investment of this project is about 210 million 13", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "c47cd1d13f221e95afe8e8c42c7a71d62f8eac15", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2922354190", "DOI": "10.1007/s42823-019-00035-x", "CorpusId": 139625497}, "title": "Fabrication of carbon nanofiber electrodes using poly(acrylonitrile-co-vinylimidazole) and their energy storage performance", "abstract": "For electrodes in electrochemical double-layer capacitors, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) were prepared by thermal treatment of precursor polymer nanofibers, fabricated by electrospinning. Poly(acrylonitrile-co-vinylimidazole) (PAV) was employed as a precursor polymer of carbon nanofibers due to the effective cyclization of PAV polymer chains during thermal treatment compared to a typical precursor, polyacrylonitrile (PAN). PAV solutions with different comonomer compositions were prepared and electrospun to produce precursor nanofibers. Surface images obtained from scanning electron microscopy showed that their nanofibrous structure was well preserved after carbonization. It was also confirmed that electrospun PAV nanofibers were successfully converted to carbon nanofibers after the carbonization step by Raman spectroscopy. Carbon nanofiber electrodes derived from PAV showed higher specific capacitances and energy/power densities than those from PAN, which was tested by coin-type cells. It was also shown that PAV with an acrylonitrile/vinylimidazole composition of 83:17 is most promising for the carbon nanofiber precursor exhibiting a specific capacitance of 114\u00a0F/g. Their energy and power density are 70.1\u00a0Wh/kg at 1\u00a0A/g and 9.5\u00a0W/kg at 6\u00a0A/g, respectively.

Over the lifetime of the project, the injected CO2 gas will displace the oil column in the heterogeneous carbonate rock system in a miscible gravity dominate mode.\n Petrophysical data needed to construct a simulation model for Zarrarh field was collected from literature review. We used 12 analogous rock types from neighboring fields of Asab and Bu Hasa. The CMG-GEM reservoir model used 18 components to describe the fluid properties and to verify no asphaltene drop out near the producing well bore. The model was calibrated on total field oil production and gas oil ratio and then various CO2 flooding scenarios were tested to optimize recovery and minimize gas coning in the horizontal well flooding patterns.\n The current production method for Zarrarah field is gas cap expansion with recycling of lean methane gas into the gas cap for pressure maintenance and recovery of NGLs. The averaged over the heterogeneous rock type regions, the miscible CO2 flood recovered at least 20% additional oil for each reservoir sector. The percentage of produced NGLs from the total in place will increase from 23% to 36% over the lifetime of the project with CO2 extraction. This production method will also supply for UAE and KSA at least 20 GW of zero emissions electric power for the next thirty years. CO2 reduces the oil viscosity and reduces gas coning by swelling the oil in the natural fractures system. The optimal CO2 injection technique is flank injection starting at the northern end of Zarrarah field. At the end of project life, the CO2 gas reserves should approach 30 TSCF to flood other reservoirs in the Empty Quarter such as Shah oil field.\n The novelty of this work is designing the first economic and zero emission power plant for EOR in KSA and UAE. Generating the first economic man-made CO2 storage reservoir for future miscible oil recovery in the Empty Quarter. The increased NGL recovery will help supply the feed stock for the petrochemical industry for the next 30 years.

SOC concentrations are controlled by several dynamic variables, ranging from micro-scale properties like particle aggregation, to larger-scale drivers such as climate and land cover. Hence, soils are vulnerable to climate change and human disturbances, with implications for ecosystem services such as agriculture and global warming mitigation. Recent decades have seen greater efforts to monitor SOC dynamics, such as the UKCEH Countryside Survey, and to predict concentrations of SOC where we have no measurements, using geostatistics or machine learning approaches. Yet, there is still much to be understood about what controls spatial patterns of SOC, and how effectively different modelling approaches can capture this. Here, we compare predictions by nine maps of the spatial distribution of topsoil SOC in Great Britain. We found broad similarities in SOC concentrations predicted by all maps, which each showed rightskewed distributions with similar median values (43 to 97 g kg -1 ). The greatest differences between maps occur at higher latitudes and are reflected in the upper ends of the SOC distributions. While the maps generally exhibit a sharp rise in SOC concentrations with increasing latitude from ~54 o N, values predicted by the ISRIC-2017 and FAO-GSOC maps show weaker increases with increasing latitude, and peak at lower values of 332 g kg -1 and 354 g kg -1 , respectively. We demonstrate that most of the maps, regardless of the modelling approach taken or the underlying data used, produced similar estimates of SOC concentration, including broad spatial patterns. This work will form the basis of more detailed future assessments of the sensitivity of SOC mapping to analytical methods versus the data used to drive these methods, and will be used to assess the importance of using stratified random field survey approaches for generating more accurate predictions of areas that cannot be sampled. Exploration of why and where different and coincident SOC predictions occur between maps should shed light on the utility of different modelling techniques and machine-learning meta-analyses of driving variables currently used to map SOC.

More research is needed to identify suitable formations. The prospects for ocean storage (i.e. within the water column) are hampered by environmental risks. Numerical modelling is likely the only available tool to evaluate and predict the fate of CO2 injected in deep geological reservoirs, and particularly in depleted hydrocarbon fields.

All of the as-synthesized OMCs exhibit much higher Li storage capacity and better cyclability along with comparable rate capability as compared with commercial graphite. Particularly, the OMC-3 with the shortest length demonstrates the highest reversible discharge capacity of 1012 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) and better cyclability with 86.6% retention of initial capacity after 100 cycles. Although the Coulombic efficiencies of all the OMCs are relatively low at the beginning, they improve promptly and after 10 cycles reach the level comparable to commercial graphite. Based on their specific capacity, cycle efficiency, and rate capability, the OMC-3 outperforms considerably its carbon peers, OMC-1 and OMC-2 with longer length. This behavior is mainly attributed to higher specific surface area, which provides more active sites for Li adsorption and storage along with the larger mesopore volume and shorter mesopore channels, which facilitate fast Li ion diffusion and electrolyte transport. The enhancement in reversible Li storage performance with decrease in the channel length is also supported by low solid electrolyte interphase resistance, contact resistance, and Warburg impedance in electrochemical impedance spectroscopy.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "948ce04128ef53027ad70474a7527e2256d45540", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3158868053", "DOI": "10.22541/au.158930956.66985695", "CorpusId": 235848494}, "title": "POSITIVE EFFECTS OF LEGUMES ON SOIL ORGANIC CARBON STORAGE DISAPPEAR AT HIGH LEGUME PROPORTION ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS IN GRASSLANDS IN THE PYRENEES", "abstract": "Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon pool, making it crucial for climate change mitigation.

It is therefore likely that multiple storage operations will access the same storage reservoir, leading to the potential for overlapping pressure responses. Pressure management through brine production is an approach to reduce the pressure response of injection operations, concomitantly reducing the potential for overlap. In this study numerical modeling is used to simulate the basin-wide deployment of CCS in the Illinois Basin, USA to determine the potential impact of brine production on pressure increase at the injection wells and the Areas of Review (the area that the US Environmental Protection agency deems at risk for CO2 and brine leakage; AoR) of the injection operations. The results show that brine production can reduce the combined size of AoRs by about one order of magnitude, if a volume of brine equivalent to the volume of injected CO2 is produced. Sites with low injection rates and/or favorable storage properties (i.e., high permeability and porosity, large thickness and depth) may not need pressure management, if the critical pressure is only exceeded within the CO2 plume. Injection of CO2 at locations with favorable storage properties leads to a combined AoR 30% smaller than if the injection sites are co-located with large stationary sources. However, pipeline networks would need to be developed to transport CO2 from the sources to the injection sites. If the produced brine is to be disposed through reinjection into the subsurface, the reinjection formation needs to be hydraulically isolated from the storage formation, as to not negate the effect of pressure management. The results also show that injectivity does not seem to be a major issue in the Illinois Basin, with only four out of 54 hypothetical CCS sites exceeding the allowable pressure increase set to prevent injection-induced seismicity. Unfortunately, brine production is not an effective strategy to control the maximum pressure increase at the four sites, so that a reduction in injection rates is necessary. If the injections occur at locations more favorable for injection, pressures are well below the maximum allowable levels, while maintaining the same basin-wide injection rates. \u00a9 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

The Evergreen Formation is more variable, with interbedded low porosity and permeability mudstones, fine-grained sandstones, and calcite cemented zones. Injected CO2 dissolves into formation water forming carbonic acid. The geochemical reactivity of drill core samples affects the predicted pH and the dissolution or precipitation of minerals which could permanently trap CO2 as carbonates such as siderite, or dynamically change porosity and permeability altering CO2 migration. Comparative kinetic geochemical modelling of the CO2 reactivity of four representative mineralogies from drill core samples from deeper parts of the central basin indicates that the Evergreen Formation is potentially more reactive to CO2 than the Precipice Sandstone, especially for calcite or siderite containing zones. In the Precipice Sandstone small amounts of albite and siderite dissolved with traces of siderite and kaolinite precipitated. Dissolution of calcite and siderite in the Evergreen Formation favourably buffered acidity, with predicted precipitated minerals including siderite, kaolinite, ankerite, and smectites.

Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) was stored when the substrate was acetate or ethanol, while no appreciable formation of storage compound was detected using glutamic acid.

ASM3 and two derived models were used in the interpretation of experimental data with reference to synthetic substrates. With reference to synthetic substrates ASM3 can well describe the experimental data only assuming a stored product formation much higher than the analytically detected one, whereas the model that assumes a parallel growth and storage on the substrate can well describe the observed stored product profile only assuming a direct contribution of growth much higher than estimated from ammonia consumption. The model that assumes an accumulation/biosorption stage as first step of substrate removal can better describe the whole experimentally observed behaviour.

Numerous strategies are currently explored in order to identify the most efficient and less expensive process, which could reach a high CO2 capture ratio (typically 80% or more), together with the production of a carbon dioxide stream of high purity (typically a CO2 volume fraction of 0.8 or more).

In this study, the effect of limiting inorganic phosphorus (KH2PO4) and nitrogen ((NH4)2SO4) sources in lipid-rich culture medium on the efficiency of cellular lipid biosynthesis by Y. lipolytica yeast has been investigated. In batch cultures, the carbon source was rapeseed waste post-frying oil (50 g/dm3). A significant relationship between the concentration of KH2PO4 and the amount of lipids accumulated has been revealed. In the shake-flask cultures, storage lipid yield was correlated with lower doses of phosphorus source in the medium. In bioreactor culture in mineral medium with (g/dm3) 3.0 KH2PO4 and 3.0 (NH4)2SO4, the cellular lipid yield was 47.5% (w/w). Simultaneous limitation of both phosphorus and nitrogen sources promoted lipid accumulation in cells, but at the same time created unfavorable conditions for biomass growth (0.78 gd.m./dm3). Increased phosphorus availability with limited cellular access to nitrogen resulted in higher biomass yields (7.45 gd.m./dm3) than phosphorus limitation in a nitrogen-rich medium (4.56 gd.m./dm3), with comparable lipid yields (30% and 32%). Regardless of the medium composition, the yeast preferentially accumulated oleic and linoleic acids as well as linolenic acid up to 8.89%. Further, it is crucial to determine the correlation between N/P molar ratios, biomass growth and efficient lipid accumulation.

Therefore, governments, research centers, IOC\u2019s and NOC\u2019s are actively adopting new guidelines and inventing new technologies to safely circulate carbons. In this paper, the process of modeling CO2 sequestration in a deep saline aquifer will be discussed.\n Carbon dioxide can be safely stored indefinitely in subsurface geological formations by four trapping mechanisms; structural, residual, soluble, and mineral trapping. These four trapping mechanisms can take hundreds or thousands of years to happen. Furthermore, the oil and gas industry standard recommend that any technology used to store CO2 needs to demonstrate a storage capacity of 1000 years with less than 0.1 per-cent leakage potential per year. Therefore, modelling such process should capture any existing trapping mechanism, even if it happens after several hundreds of years, to ensure long-term secure storage of the CO2. Using our in-house simulator \"GigaPOWERS\", many sequestration scenarios were conducted to come up with a recommended guideline to maximize the volume of CO2 trapped in deep saline aquifers.\n This study used a giant synthetic anticline model with a variation in geological properties. The residual and soluble trapping mechanisms were captured through relative permeability hysteresis and extended water PVT tables respectively. Injecting CO2 into water aquifers is a dynamic process where drainage and imbibition cycles are likely to happen. Such processes cause the CO2 to be trapped in the middle of the pores as an immobile phase, which can be a favorable phenomenon maximizing the security of CO2 sequestration. Since CO2 is soluble in water, when it contacts the water phase it will form a carbonated water that is denser than water itself and migrates downward in a phenomenon known as \"CO2 fingering\". The CO2 solubility in water depends mainly on the salinity and temperature which both need to be accurately captured in the simulation model. Depending on the long-term objective of the sequestration project, the development strategy can be altered to maximize the outcome using the detailed simulation model. In this paper, the simulation best practices for modeling CO2 sequestration for maximum secure long-term storage (1000+ years) are suggested.\n Carbon dioxide, CO2, sequestration in deep saline aquifers is a well-known method to reduce carbon emissions. However, there is very little published literature on the simulation best practices for modeling the CO2 sequestration process. Therefore, this paper will be a pioneer to guide the industry for accurate simulation of such process.", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "a0e904569de1809cad682afc8d23679758a0de73", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3086008980", "DOI": "10.20944/PREPRINTS202009.0325.V1", "CorpusId": 224970665}, "title": "A Bibliometric Analysis of Research on Membrane Coated Electrodes in the 2001-2019 Period: Potential Application to CO2 Capture and Utilization", "abstract": "The chemistry and electrochemistry basic fields have been active since the last two decades of the past century studying how surface modification of electrodes by coating with conductive films enhances their activity and performance.

Two of these, carbon sequestration and wood production, are often portrayed as conflicting. Currently, carbon management and biofuel policies are being developed to reduce atmospheric CO2 and national dependence on foreign oil, and increase carbon storage in ecosystems. However, the biological and industrial forest carbon cycles are rarely studied in a whole-system structure. The forest system carbon balance is the difference between the biological (net ecosystem production) and industrial (net emissions from forest industry) forest carbon cycles, but to date this critical whole system analysis is lacking. This study presents a model of the forest system, uses it to compute the carbon balance, and outlines a methodology to maximize future carbon uptake in a managed forest region.ResultsWe used a coupled forest ecosystem process and forest products life cycle inventory model for a regional temperate forest in the Midwestern U.S., and found the net system carbon balance for this 615,000 ha forest was positive (2.29\u2009t\u2009C\u2009ha-1\u2009yr-1). The industrial carbon budget was typically less than 10% of the biological system annually, and averaged averaged 0.082\u2009t\u2009C\u2009ha-1\u2009yr-1. Net C uptake over the next 100-years increased by 22% or 0.33\u2009t\u2009C\u2009ha-1\u2009yr-1 relative to the current harvest rate in the study region under the optized harvest regime.ConclusionsThe forest\u2019s biological ecosystem current and future carbon uptake capacity is largely determined by forest harvest practices that occurred over a century ago, but we show an optimized harvesting strategy would increase future carbon sequestration, or wood production, by 20-30%, reduce long transportation chain emissions, and maintain many desirable stand structural attributes that are correlated to biodiversity. Our results for this forest region suggest that increasing harvest over the next 100\u2009years increases the strength of the carbon sink, and that carbon sequestration and wood production are not conflicting for this particular forest ecosystem.

Accurate and precise event locations are vital for the characterization of the microseismicity to help understand the reservoir response to the CO2 injection, whilst enabling the identification of minor faults and fractures below the resolution of conventional active seismic imaging. However, microseismic monitoring of fluid injection sites, such as Decatur, is often performed using a network of borehole sensors often from a single well. While these downhole sensors have excellent detection capabilities, their poor azimuthal coverage limits the ability to precisely determine event locations. We have developed a modified double-difference relocation algorithm suitable for both 1-D and 3-D velocity models, and which incorporates differential back azimuth observations to allow the benefits of the original double-difference algorithm to be applicable to a downhole microseismic monitoring setting. Applying the modified double-difference algorithm to the microseismicity at Decatur, we have successfully relocated 4293 events. The relocation included over 59 million observations for 757\u00a0285 event pairs, split across seven geographic regions. Despite the majority of observations being recorded in only two boreholes, with an almost identical azimuthal coverage, the results have shown to be reliable with significantly reduced residuals and low uncertainties associated with the final locations. We have analysed the residuals in terms of their association with each geographic region, data type, station and individual events, to fully appreciate their influence in the inversion and the fit of the data to the final set of event locations. For each region, the relocated seismicity has become less diffuse with improved clustering, and with newly visible linear features often orientated in a NE\u2013SW direction.

One of the technologies is using solid sorbent such as activated carbon, silica, metal oxides, and zeolite. Recently, there has been a significant increase in the research of Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) which are believed to be the most promising adsorbent in CO2 adsorption application. It is a crystalline type of porous material consisting of the metal ions and the organic ligands. With all the advantages possessed by MOFs, these adsorbents are still difficult to be applied on industrial scale due to high fabrication cost. Composed of non-renewable feedstock raw materials, some MOFs are not environmentally friendly. To quickly response this challenge, we conducted investigation on the use of biologically derived MOF (Bio-MOF) in CO2 capture application. A novel of Bio-MOF Chromium-Citric Acid (Cr-CA) has been explored. The synthesis process is carried out through the hydrothermal reaction method using eco-friendly solvent potassium hydroxide and Aquabidest.

A mathematical model considering the effect of threshold pressure gradient (TPG) for CO2 flow and storage in low permeability saline aquifer has been developed, and the corresponding numerical model has been formulated and solved. From the numerical results, we can conclude that the injection rate, cumulative CO2 injected, and the storage efficiency for the case with TPG are always less than those of the case without TPG because of the sharp pressure decline and increased energy consumption. Under this paper's calculation condition, the storage efficiency when considering TPG is about 10% less than the case without considering TPG.

Major CO 2 emissions sources are located within power and industrial sectors where fossil fuels are consumed to generate energy. With the anticipated escalation of global energy demand, CO 2 emissions are also expected to grow. Therefore, reducing CO 2 emissions to atmosphere is a fatal issue worldwide. Capturing CO 2 from emissions sources and injected into safe geological places for storage shows a practical mitigation strategy through CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) practices. In CCS projects, several options are available for CO 2 storage such as subsurface aquifers, coalbed bed methane formations, or depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Alternatively to these storage places, CO 2 can be utilized to enhance oil production from mature oil reservoirs. Utilization of CO 2 in enhanced oil recovery techniques (EOR) is a well known practice in oil industry. Therefore, synchronizing between the objectives of storing CO 2 and enhancing oil production to meet global demand can be achieved through CO 2 -EOR projects. The giant oil reservoirs in the Middle East represent potential places for CO 2 -EOR projects. In this paper, oil reservoirs located in the Middle East are selected to evaluate the potential of CO 2 -EOR projects in the region. These reservoirs were subjected to CO 2 -EOR screening where the fluid and rock properties are compared with a well known criteria.

A better understanding of the thermodynamic properties of CO2 mixtures could provide a scientific basis to define a proper guideline of CO2 purity and impure components for the CCS processes according to technical, safety and environmental requirements. However the available accurate experimental data cannot cover the whole operation conditions of CCS processes. In order to overcome the shortage of experimental data, theoretical estimation and modelling are used as a supplemental approach. In this thesis, the available experimental data on the thermodynamic properties of CO2 mixtures were first collected, and their applicability and gaps for theoretical model verification and calibration were also determined according to the required thermodynamic properties and operation conditions of CCS. Then in order to provide recommendations concerning calculation methods for engineering design of CCS, totally eight equations of state (EOS) were evaluated for the calculations about vapour liquid equilibrium (VLE) and density of CO2-mixtures, including N2, O2, SO2, Ar, H2S and CH4. With the identified equations of state, the preliminary assessment of impurity impacts was further conducted regarding the thermodynamic properties of CO2-mixtures and different processes involved in CCS system. Results show that the increment of the mole fraction of non-condensable gases would make purification, compression and condensation more difficult. Comparatively N2 can be separated more easily from the CO2-mixtures than O2 and Ar. And a lower CO2 recovery rate is expected for the physical separation of CO2/N2 under the same separation conditions. In addition, the evaluations about the acceptable concentration of non-condensable impurities show that the transport conditions in vessels are more sensitive to the non-condensable impurities and it requires very low concentration of non-condensable impurities in order to avoid two-phase problems. Meanwhile, the performances of evaporative gas turbine integrated with different CO2 capture technologies were investigated from both technical and economical aspects. It is concluded that the evaporative gas turbine (EvGT) cycle with chemical absorption capture has a smaller penalty on electrical efficiency, while a lower CO2 capture ratio than the EvGT cycle with O2/CO2 recycle combustion capture. Therefore, although EvGT + chemical absorption has a higher annual cost, it has a lower cost of electricity because of its higher efficiency. However considering its lower CO2 capture ratio, EvGT + chemical absorption has a higher cost to avoid 1 ton CO2. In addition the efficiency of EvGT + chemical absorption can be increased by optimizing Water/Air ratio, increasing the operating pressure of stripper and adding a flue gas condenser condensing out the excessive water.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "38e7a9f6d08e4d494df3b1d272b6a7306bfa2f55", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3186073952", "DOI": "10.3303/CET2186087", "CorpusId": 235619742}, "title": "Assessment of CO2 Storage as Hydrates in Saline Aquifers Using Machine Learning Algorithms", "abstract": "Global warming is one of the most serious issues the world is currently facing.

One focuses on developing non-fossil energy technologies which generate no carbon. These include extensive use of solar, wind, and nuclear energies, acceleration of the pace of replacing fuel-powered vehicles by electric ones, and development of new techniques to boost the performance of energy storage devices.The other aspect is dedicated to using geology-based technologies to process carbon generated by the combustion of fossil fuels, namely, using carbon capture and storage (CCS) and geothermal energy techniques to mitigate greenhouse gas emission. Although progress in pursuing those non-fossil energy technologies has been rapid, they still \u201csatisfy only a small portion in the global energy demand\u201d [1]. Even from themost optimistic point of view, the transition would need at least several decades for the fossil energy system onwhichmodern civilisation is built to be replaced by these clean renewables or zero-carbons. On the other hand, the global emission of carbon is estimated currently at over 35,000 million tonnes per annum [2], and that emission rate may persist or even continue to increase until 2030 or later [3]. According to the IEA analysis, the world needs to capture and store around 4,000 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of CO 2 in 2040 till the end of this century. Otherwise, the ultimate goal of the Paris Agreement (limiting the temperature increase to \u201cwell below\u201d 2C) would not be reached [4].

Movement towards predominately low-carbon energy systems requires renewable resources and could be accelerated by integration of carbon capture and storage (CCS) with renewable energy. Currently, substantial penetration of wind and solar resources into the electric power grid is challenged by their intermittency and the timing of generation which can place huge ramping requirements on central utility plants [1], which are also limited in dynamic response capability. Storing the electric energy directly into batteries is one of the most efficient ways to preserve the energy generated from renewable resources, but capacity limitations of conventional batteries are too great at present to economically store enough energy at utility-scales. This talk will discuss employing novel EES systems derived from reversible fuel cell technology as a dispatchable energy resource. Reversible solid oxide cells (ReSOCs) are an electrochemical energy technology capable of providing high roundtrip efficiency and cost-effective electrical energy storage, and offer many advantages over other options. ReSOC systems operate sequentially between fuel-producing electrolysis and power-producing fuel-cell modes with storage of reactants and products (CO2/CH4 gases) in tanks for smaller-scale applications (see Fig. 1) and in caverns for larger, seasonal storage (see Fig. 2). Maintaining the high conversion efficiencies seen in laboratory-scale cell tests at the system-level, requires careful system design to integrate storage and electrochemical conversion functions. By leveraging H-C-O reaction chemistry and operating at intermediate temperature, the ReSOC is mildly exothermic in both operating modes, which simplifies balance-of-plant integration and thermal management. In this talk we discuss the thermodynamics of cell operation and system concepts for leveraging C-H-O chemistry for energy storage and Power-to-Gas production options. System concepts and strategies for effective thermal management and balance-of-plant systems integration, which are critical to achieving high roundtrip efficiencies, are highlighted, including distributed energy systems. The roundtrip efficiency, energy density, and capital cost tradeoffs of these configurations are quantified through computational modeling and productioncost estimates for the technology. Results indicate that roundtrip efficiency and cost of storage for large-scale energy storage ReSOC systems are about 72% and range from 3-8 \u00a2/kWh, respectively. Market arbitrage scenarios for large, grid-energy storage could enable storage costs to be converted to revenues. At the distributed scale, system performance of nearly 70% roundtrip efficiency and cost of storage at 6-7 \u00a2/kWh are possible.

With this research project, we aim to develop a framework for quantitative evaluation of existing and proposed carbon-capture technologies. This framework is based on an exergy-based systems analysis performed at the local (system) level and at the global (life cycle) level, and a techno-economic evaluation of the technology. Work to date has focused on two tasks: (1) the development of a system model for a generalized adsorption unit using custom-written code in Matlab, after surveying available commercial flowsheeting software; and (2) the development of custom-written Matlab code for exergetic life cycle calculations, using data from the Ecoinvent Data v2.1 (2009) life cycle assessment database. Introduction With this research project, we seek to answer the set of questions: What technologies or combination of technologies can provide CO2 capture at energy costs much closer to underlying thermodynamic limits? Are the conditions and technology configurations required to achieve such efficiencies possible with available or foreseeable materials? What are the broader (e.g., full system) environmental implications of such technology implementations? What are the likely costs of these technologies? And, given all of the above considerations, which technologies are likely to supply practical, cost-competitive electricity with low life-cycle CO2 emissions? We are approaching these questions by focusing on four types of carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems with different characteristics, ensuring that a representative range of technologies are studied. Each of the four CCS technologies will be evaluated on three bases: (1) an exergetic systems analysis so that the evaluation takes place with respect to absolute, thermodynamic limits; (2) a full life-cycle basis such that all ancillary exergy consumption and destruction\u2014both embodied components and in-process interactions with the environment\u2014are included; and (3) a techno-economic analysis of the technology such that technology options can be evaluated via economic metrics as well. The systems include one baseline option\u2014namely, a MEA/NGCC reference system such as the one studied by NETL [1]\u2014for calibration of methodology, and three advanced technologies. The advanced technologies were chosen in conjunction with GCEP to represent the range of CCS options, and to complement the work of other GCEP research groups. They include one metal-organic framework (MOF) based adsorption system, one biomimetic sorbent, and one ionic liquids absorption system. Our three-part analysis will result in three metrics for each system: work-specific exergy consumption, work-specific carbon emissions to the atmosphere, and first-order estimates of levelized cost of electricity (where the work is the output of the associated power plant, as reduced by the added carbon-capture system). Each of these metrics can be defined on a local (system-only) and global (life cycle) basis. The end goal of this project is not only to provide accurate analyses of selected carbon-capture options, but to frame the comparisons of these options in a coherent, compelling way. We believe that our three metrics will allow such a comparative analysis. Background Despite growing concerns about climate change, it is very likely that carbon-based fuels will continue to be used in the coming decades for base-load power generation and for firming of intermittent renewable power sources. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is therefore a necessary part of any comprehensive strategy for achieving required reductions in carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Significant studies of proposed carbon capture systems have been performed, including those produced as part of the IPCC process [2], those produced by the U.S. DOE [1], those from the IEA [3], and numerous academic and industrial analyses [4-6]. These studies arrive at the common conclusion that existing options for post-combustion carbon capture lead to a significant loss of plant output (as much as 30%) and a significant rise in cost of electricity (as much as 80%) when compared to a similar plant without carbon capture. These numbers might be deemed acceptable\u2014perhaps even unavoidable\u2014were it not for the fact that thermodynamic limits suggest that much more efficient processes are possible. Considered in terms of the minimum work required to separate carbon dioxide generated by combustion of natural gas from its flue gas at atmospheric pressure, only a 2.4% loss of plant output is actually required [7]. Note that even after compressing the CO2 to 100 bar (the pressure prescribed by NETL for use in comparing separation options, [1]), the fraction of exergy required has only risen to 3.5%. These figures illustrate a key point: Assuming an exergy efficiency of ~50% 1 for the overall plant, it should be possible to develop a separation methodology that meets NETL specifications while incurring only a 7% loss of plant output. This leads to a need to analyze the performance of carbon capture systems via an exergy analysis, in order to compare their operation to this thermodynamic baseline. The objective of this type of analysis is to understand the distribution of exergy within a system such that the causes of its destruction are exposed and quantified. With the exergy distribution of a plant or process known, not only is its overall quality assessed with respect to a fundamental, absolute yardstick, but the locations and magnitudes of losses are revealed for inspection (and thereby improvement). Exergy analysis provides both an unambiguous assessment and immediately points the way to process improvement. 1 For example, the exergy efficiency of a modern (F-class) NGCC power plant is ~52%. Our research takes the analysis further by incorporating global effects in the comparison of carbon capture systems. Using results from the exergetic systems analysis, a life-cycle assessment (LCA) will be conducted in order to better understand how a given CCS technology interacts with the environment at broad scales. This assessment includes not only direct energy consumption (i.e., exergy consumption) at a facility, but also the exergy destruction associated with all \u201cembodied\u201d materials and components, as well as the operational interactions with the environment. The goal of this analysis is to understand which technology option results in the smallest disruption to the environment and results in the smallest drawdown of valuable energy and material resources (e.g., exergy stores) across the entire supply chain. This will enable a better understanding of the tradeoffs between using sophisticated material inputs (which often require more embodied energy inputs) and reducing energy impacts on site. A number of LCAs have been performed of CCS technologies [8-10]. These LCAs serve to situate a CCS technology within the broader industrial ecosystem, tracking all material and energy flows both upstream and downstream of a technology of interest. In our case, this set of material and energy flows will be utilized in an exergetic approach to LCA [11-13]. Results The project is still in its early stages, having begun recently. To date, work has focused on two tasks: developing the model for an adsorption system on the exergetic systems analysis side, and building the framework for the exergetic LCA on the life cycle assessment side. Exergetic Systems Analysis Given that two of our advanced carbon capture systems are adsorption-based (the MOF system and the biomimetic sorbent system), we chose to focus initially on building a general model for an adsorption system. When modeling such systems, many choices can be made about the nature of the system itself and of its cyclic operation. We have surveyed these choices and available modeling options, so that a decision could be made about the modeling direction to be taken. Fixed-bed adsorption systems can operate as pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) systems [14-16], vacuum-swing adsorption (VSA) systems [17, 18], or temperature-swing adsorption (TSA) systems [19]. Some systems combine the effects of changing both parameters, in pressure-temperature-swing adsorption (PTSA) [20]. Inside the bed, the sorbent is generally arranged as a packed bed of pellets, but there has been some recent exploration of different internal geometries, including monoliths and laminates [21]. Each of these choices carries corresponding simplifying assumptions in the mathematical treatment of the conservation equations in the bed. For example, models of PSA systems in which external heat transfer is negligible (for example, in short, wide columns) generally disregard the effect of radial gradients in temperature and gas-phase composition. This assumption is not accurate for TSA systems, due to the fact that the temperature swings are generated by heat transfer to a cooling/warming fluid, and that heat transfer is a direct result of radial temperature gradients in the column. Similarly, momentum conservation in fixed bed adsorption systems is typically represented by the Ergun equation, which represents the pressure gradient in packed beds for a range of Reynolds numbers. However, if a different internal geometry of the bed is chosen\u2014such as a monolith, which is specifically designed to reduce pressure drops\u2014the momentum conservation relation will be represented quite differently. This discussion is intended to motivate our chosen approach: to model the system as generally as necessary, using custom code written in Matlab. The need for generality is driven by two realities. First, in order to make substantial improvements in the exergy efficiency of carbon capture systems, or even to gain full understanding of the exergetic limitations of these systems, we may need to c", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "996614ca9743e478853e907904da8cc5a0a994e0", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 199570115}, "title": "Simulation of an Oxyfuel Pilot-Scale Pulverized Coal Flame to Quantify the Effect of Boudouard-Reaction", "abstract": "Oxyfuel combustion in a pilot-scale coal flame (~40kWth) has been investigated using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to quantify the effect of the Boudouard reaction on the combustion process.

Especially in heterogeneous ecosystems, such as Savannas, accurate carbon quantifications are still lacking, where highly variable vegetation densities occur and a strong seasonality hinders consistent data acquisition. In order to account for these challenges we analyzed the potential of land surface phenological metrics derived from gap-filled 8-day Landsat time series for carbon mapping. We selected three areas located in different subregions in the central Brazil region, which is a prominent example of a Savanna with significant carbon stocks that has been undergoing extensive land cover conversions. Here phenological metrics from the season 2014/2015 were combined with aboveground carbon field samples of cerrado sensu stricto vegetation using Random Forest regression models to map the regional carbon distribution and to analyze the relation between phenological metrics and aboveground carbon.ResultsThe gap filling approach enabled to accurately approximate the original Landsat ETM+ and OLI EVI values and the subsequent derivation of annual phenological metrics.

Indeed, given the lacking capacity storage of batteries, electricity production has to become more flexible to keep demand and production balanced. Micro Gas Turbines (mGTs) are good candidates to provide this necessary flexibility. Still, their carbon footprint has to be reduced (and even become zero) to move towards a carbon-clean power production in 2050. The application of post-combustion Carbon Capture (CC) offers a solution to remove CO2 from mGT flue gases. Applying a conventional CC process with monoethanolamine (MEA) to mGT has already been numerically investigated in previous work \uf05b\uf031\uf05d. Results highlighted however the strong negative impact of applying CC on mGT performances: 7.9 absolute% decrease in electric efficiency, mainly due to the high energy requirement for the CC process. Indeed, compared to coal or large-scale gas turbines power plants, applying CC to mGTs is more disadvantageous because of the low CO2 content of their flue gases: 1.5 vol.% or still below 5%, even when Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is applied. Therefore, the energy consumption of the CC plant must be reduced to make carbon clean mGT more efficient and profitable. Next to a better integration of the different mGT and CC heat streams [2], the selection of the appropriate solvent and process configuration will help reducing the energy penalty: for instance, the use of a promising blend of methyldiethanolamine with piperazine (MDEA/PZ) as solvent is investigated in this work. The benefit of using the MDEA/PZ blend instead of the conventional MEA solvent for removing CO2 has already been shown in coal-fired power plant or cement plant flue gases [3,4], yet, no study has been carried out on application with a specific low CO2 content, as those found in mGT flue gases. Next to the careful selection of the solvent, further reduction in CC energy consumption can be achieved by improving the process configuration. The absorber intercooling configuration has proven to be more efficient for coalfired or cement plants applications but has not been investigated for low CO2 content flue gases.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "0396b7edb9b6ff2295181e7072e25040c6138ffb", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "8675887", "DOI": "10.3389/fpls.2021.745855", "CorpusId": 244779322}, "title": "Adaptation of Temperate Seagrass to Arctic Light Relies on Seasonal Acclimatization of Carbon Capture and Metabolism", "abstract": "Due to rising global surface temperatures, Arctic habitats are becoming thermally suitable for temperate species. Whether a temperate species can immigrate into an ice-free Arctic depends on its ability to tolerate extreme seasonal fluctuations in daylength. Thus, understanding adaptations to polar light conditions can improve the realism of models predicting poleward range expansions in response to climate change. Plant adaptations to polar light have rarely been studied and remain unknown in seagrasses. If these ecosystem engineers can migrate polewards, seagrasses will enrich biodiversity, and carbon capture potential in shallow coastal regions of the Arctic. Eelgrass (Zostera marina) is the most widely distributed seagrass in the northern hemisphere. As the only seagrass species growing as far north as 70\u00b0N, it is the most likely candidate to first immigrate into an ice-free Arctic. Here, we describe seasonal (and diurnal) changes in photosynthetic characteristics, and in genome-wide gene expression patterns under strong annual fluctuations of daylength. We compared PAM measurements and RNA-seq data between two populations at the longest and shortest day of the year: (1) a Mediterranean population exposed to moderate annual fluctuations of 10\u201314 h daylength and (2) an Arctic population exposed to high annual fluctuations of 0\u201324 h daylength. Most of the gene expression specificities of the Arctic population were found in functions of the organelles (chloroplast and mitochondrion). In winter, Arctic eelgrass conserves energy by repressing respiration and reducing photosynthetic energy fluxes. Although light-reactions, and genes involved in carbon capture and carbon storage were upregulated in summer, enzymes involved in CO2 fixation and chlorophyll-synthesis were upregulated in winter, suggesting that winter metabolism relies not only on stored energy resources but also on active use of dim light conditions. Eelgrass is unable to use excessive amounts of light during summer and demonstrates a significant reduction in photosynthetic performance under long daylengths, possibly to prevent photoinhibition constrains. Our study identified key mechanisms that allow eelgrass to survive under Arctic light conditions and paves the way for experimental research to predict whether and up to which latitude eelgrass can potentially migrate polewards in response to climate change.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "7aeec10d28740ca9790dbaf6b66475a9235139b7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "410486576", "DOI": "10.1007/s12237-015-9993-8", "CorpusId": 83098566}, "title": "Mangrove Range Expansion Rapidly Increases Coastal Wetland Carbon Storage", "abstract": "The climate change-induced expansion of mangroves into salt marshes could significantly alter the carbon (C) storage capacity of coastal wetlands, which have the highest average C storage per land area among unmanaged terrestrial ecosystems.

Here, we quantify current C stocks in ecotonal wetlands across gradients of marsh- to mangrove-dominance, and use unique chronological maps of vegetation cover to estimate C stock changes from 2003 to 2010 in a 567-km2 wildlife refuge in the mangrove-salt marsh ecotone. We report that over the 7-yr. period, total wetland C stocks increased 22\u00a0% due to mangrove encroachment into salt marshes. Newly established mangrove stands stored twice as much C on a per area basis as salt marsh primarily due to differences in aboveground biomass, and mangrove cover increased by 69\u00a0% during this short time interval.

In that case, both CO2 capture ratio and CO2 purity should be high enough (typically above 90%) [1]. Today, the best currently available technology is absorption in a chemical solvent (such as monoethanolamine, MEA) and is considered as a reference for post combustion capture. The corresponding energy requirement is of approximately 4GJth (thermal basis)/ton of recovered CO2 (including compression requirement). A target of 2 GJth/ton is often mentioned according to the European Union recommendations [2]. Membrane processes have shown growing interest as an alternative to this reference technology. However they remain energy intensive when both high CO2 purity and capture ratio are imposed and when diluted CO2 flue gas are to be treated [3]. Consequently, for diluted CO2 flue gases containing 5 % and 15% CO2, typical of a natural gas turbine flue gas and coal combustion respectively, a multi-stage membrane processes or hybrid systems are needed to achieve the capture targets [4,5]. However, design studies on hybrid processes based on a membrane unit for carbon capture are scarce [6]. In this work, two hybrid processes are investigated (through simulation) for CO2 capture on natural gas turbine and coal power plant respectively: (i) A hybrid process combining flue gas recycling, combustion in oxygen enhanced air (OEA) and CO2 capture by membranes (ii) A hybrid membrane / cryogenic separation based on a first step CO2 pre-concentration with a membrane unit and a second step CO2 cryogenic condensation. For each hybrid process, a parametric analysis has been performed regarding the process parameters and the membrane CO2 /N2 selectivity, covering current and prospective material development. Finally, the optimal operating conditions are identified and the potential improvement of the overall efficiency is discussed. 1. Natural gas turbine As mentioned above, there is a substantial benefit derived from strategically increasing the feed gas CO2 concentration. Based on this, a hybrid process performance for CO2 capture on a gas turbine, based on a combination of flue gas recycling, combustion in oxygen enhanced air (OEA) and membrane separation has been evaluated. A general diagram of the process is shown in Figure 1. Interestingly, energy requirements below 2.4 GJ/ton (including compression requirement) can be attained. Moreover, the membrane selectivity performances (tested between \uf061 = 50 and \uf061= 200) play a key role on the overall energy requirement, situation that differs from the direct \u201cend of pipe\u201d post-combustion carbon capture, where no significant improvement on the energy requirement is observed as soon as the membrane selectivity reaches a value of \uf061= 50 (commercial membrane performance). Thus, the development of highly selective membranes, far above the performances of the actual membrane materials, is of major interest for the gas turbine / membrane capture process. Furthermore, it is shown that moderate inlet pressure values (12-22 bar), together with moderate oxygen purities (45-53 %) are needed for optimal hybrid carbon capture process conditions [7].

Adding two transport equations to describe the liquid fraction and droplet number, the detailed numerical model can describe the heat and mass transfer characteristics during the CO2 phase change process under the supersonic expansion conditions. A comparative study is performed to evaluate the effect of CO2 condensation using the condensation model and dry gas assumption. The results show that the developed CFD model predicts accurately the distribution of the static temperature contrary to the dry gas assumption. Furthermore, the condensing flow model predicts a CO2 liquid fraction up to 18.6% of the total mass, which leads to the release of the latent heat to the vapour phase. The investigation performed in this study suggests that the CO2 condensation in supersonic flows provides an efficient and eco-friendly way to mitigate the CO2 emissions to the environment.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "7b5fcd7f0564f93543b6e3b5291f822a1cdc8304", "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "2102.13581", "CorpusId": 232068892}, "title": "Synergies in offshore energy: a roadmap for the Danish sector", "abstract": "This study sets out to analyze future synergies between the O&G and renewables sectors and explore how exploiting these synergies could lead to economic and environmental benefits. By firstly reviewing and highlighting relevant technologies and related projects, this report synthesizes the state of the art in offshore energy system integration, by focusing on three key technologies in electrification/floating wind, electrolysis/hydrogen production and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). With a timeframe out to 2050 and model scope including all North Sea neighbouring countries, this analysis explores a total of nine future scenarios for the North Sea energy system. The main results include an immediate electrification of all operational DUC platforms by linking them to the shore and/or a planned Danish energy island. These measures result in cost and CO2 emissions savings compared to a BAU scenario of 72% and 85% respectively. When these platforms cease production, this is followed by the repurposing of the platforms into hydrogen generators with up to 3.6 GW of electrolysers and the development of up to 5.8 GW of floating wind. The generated hydrogen is assumed to power the future transport sector, and is delivered to shore in existing and/or new purpose-built pipelines. The contribution of the O&G sector to this hydrogen production amounts to around 19 TWh, which represents about 2% of total European hydrogen demand for transport in 2050. The levelized costs (LCOE) of producing this hydrogen in 2050 are around 4 euro2012/kg H2, which is around twice those expected in similar studies.

However, there are two challenges facing scalable high-throughput deduplication storage. The first is the duplicate-lookup disk bottleneck due to the large size of data index that usually exceeds the available RAM space, which limits the deduplication throughput. The second is the storage node island effect resulting from duplicate data among multiple storage nodes that are difficult to eliminate. Existing approaches fail to completely eliminate the duplicates while simultaneously addressing the challenges. This paper proposes MAD2, a scalable high-throughput exact deduplication approach for network backup services. MAD2 eliminates duplicate data both at the file level and at the chunk level by employing four techniques to accelerate the deduplication process and evenly distribute data. First, MAD2 organizes fingerprints into a Hash Bucket Matrix (HBM), whose rows can be used to preserve the data locality in backups. Second, MAD2 uses Bloom Filter Array (BFA) as a quick index to quickly identify non-duplicate incoming data objects or indicate where to find a possible duplicate. Third, Dual Cache is integrated in MAD2 to effectively capture and exploit data locality. Finally, MAD2 employs a DHT-based Load-Balance technique to evenly distribute data objects among multiple storage nodes in their backup sequences to further enhance performance with a well-balanced load. We evaluate our MAD2 approach on the backend storage of B-Cloud, a research-oriented distributed system that provides network backup services. Experimental results show that MAD2 significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approximate deduplication approaches in terms of deduplication efficiency, supporting a deduplication throughput of at least 100MB/s for each storage component.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "1bb1910c723e3c852b355b18d84f7a4b70dead83", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2432936924", "CorpusId": 99959003}, "title": "\uae30\uae30\uc801 \uc99d\uae30 \uc7ac\uc555\ucd95 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uc5f0\uc18c \ud6c4 \uc774\uc0b0\ud654\ud0c4\uc18c \ud3ec\uc9d1\uacf5\uc815 \uac1c\uc120 \uc5f0\uad6c", "abstract": "\uae30\ud6c4\ubcc0\ud654\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc6d0\uc778 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\ub85c \uc9c0\ubaa9\ub418\ub294 \uc774\uc0b0\ud654\ud0c4\uc18c\uc758 \ubc30\ucd9c\ub7c9\uc744 \uc808\uac10\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc81c\uc548\ub41c Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) \uc804\uccb4\uacf5\uc815\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ubc0f \ube44\uc6a9\uc800\uac10\uc774 \uc2dc\uae09\ud55c \ud604 \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uacc4\uacf5\uc815\uc758 \ub3c4\ucd9c\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uba70 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5f0\uc18c \ud6c4 \uc2b5\uc2dd\uc544\ubbfc \uacf5\uc815\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud3ec\uc9d1\uacf5\uc815\uacfc \uc555\ucd95\uacf5\uc815\uc758 \uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacc4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc800\uac10\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uae30\uc801 \uc99d\uae30 \uc7ac\uc555\ucd95 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc555\ucd95\uae30\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc804\uae30\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uc5f4\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc758 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud3ec\uc9d1\uacf5\uc815\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ub9ac\ubcf4\uc77c\ub7ec\uc758 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uacf5\uc815\uac1c\uc120\uc548\uc740 \uc555\ucd95\uae30\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \ud22c\uc790\ube44\uc6a9 \ubc0f \uc804\uae30\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uace0\uc555\uc758 \uc774\uc0b0\ud654\ud0c4\uc18c\ub97c \uc0dd\uc0b0\ud568\uacfc \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc808\uac10\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc7a5\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e4\uc81c Test Bed\uc758 \uc6b4\uc804 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \uc808\uac10 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "11691f7a418098cbb71436408660d172e2e9afca", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 214777410}, "title": "EURACOAL\u2019S POSITION ON FUTURE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR CCS", "abstract": "The development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is regarded as a promising possibility to reduce CO2 emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels for power generation purposes.
