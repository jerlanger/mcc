STRATEGY CCUS aims to provide realistic strategic plans from 2025 to 2050 for deploying carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) in Southern and Eastern Europe, from a local to a European scale. Eight promising regions, within seven countries are being studied. Plans and roadmaps for these regions will be developed based on economic and environmental drivers, technical potential and social acceptance. \nThe deployment of operational CCUS clusters starts by an appraisal at local and regional level. Available data for each promising region was mapped to indicate the technical potential of CCUS development in each region. Relevant groups of stakeholders were identified and invited to form Regional Stakeholder Committees within each promising region. These committees are working with project partners to consider regional factors and concerns as well as to elaborate scenarios of CCUS deployment in their respective regions to ensure early local participation. In the 3 most promising regions for the deployment of CCUS, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), Multiregional Input Output (MRIO) analysis and Techno-Economic Assessment (TEA) designs will provide decision-support for the sustainable development of CCUS. Sound insights and a comprehensive diagnosis of the potential local business models associated with the different CCUS options will be provided for each region, as well as estimates for the sensitivity of the business model on storage capacity and injectivity data. \nCCUS roadmaps from 2025 to 2050 for each of the promising regions, with optional connections to existing CO2 infrastructure in the North Sea, will be elaborated. Scenarios will be based on the available relevant data and carried out in close exchange with the local stakeholders via the Regional Stakeholder Committees and the Industrial Club. Economic evaluation of each scenario will provide the main Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as cumulated CAPEX/OPEX required for each scenario, the cost breakdown per CCUS stakeholder, or for example the global costs expressed in \u20ac/t CO2 avoided per scenario. Lastly, an economic impact assessment will be performed at national and European levels in terms of volumes of quotas avoided for industries included in the European Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) with the CCUS scenarios and in terms of economic impact on the EU ETS carbon price. Exploitation and dissemination of the project\u2019s results and findings engage with relevant end-users (industry and policy makers, local authorities), in order to pave the way for the operational implementation of CCUS clusters.

Numerous studies show that large-scale geologic disposal of CO2 from industrial emissions will be essential to achieve this objective. There are currently 21 large-scale CCS facilities in operation. Of these large-scale CCS projects, five use geologic storage in saline formations (Sleipner, Snehvit, Quest, IBDP & Gorgon) and together inject nearly 6 million tonnes CO2 per annum (Mtpa). The remaining large-scale projects mainly use CO2EOR as the storage vehicle. Enhanced oil recovery using carbon dioxide (CO2EOR) can have a dual purpose: (a) To recover additional oil, thereby supplying energy and additional revenues; and (b) to mitigate climate change by reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Historically, CO2EOR projects have tended to maximize oil production as a function of the CO2 injected. There are various options proposed to enhance the climate mitigation effect of CO2EOR projects by maximizing the ratio of the CO2 injected to the oil produced, or by transiting projects from CO2EOR in the initial stages to pure storage projects in the later stages. However, to achieve net zero-emissions, CO2EOR projects need to include a significant fraction of non-EOR CO2 storage. CO2EOR projects also play an important role in building the infrastructure needed for large-scale carbon capture, utilisation, and storage.

A rapid rise in cutting-edge research has been facilitated by hydrocarbon companies transitioning to technically more challenging plays and feasibility studies assessing the carbon capture and storage potential of the basin. The purpose of this review is to provide researchers and new and existing operating companies with an integrated summary of recent research and the fundamentals of the structurally complex basin with the aim of ensuring that the hydrocarbon potential can be effectively explored and appropriately developed, and that the carbon capture and storage potential of the basin is appropriately evaluated. A modern tectonostratigraphic evolution model is presented alongside the stress regime, orientation and magnitude of the six events that have affected the province (N\u2013S Carboniferous Alice Springs Orogeny; SE\u2013NW mid-Permian event; NE\u2013SW late Permian Daralingie event; E\u2013W Triassic Hunter\u2013Bowen Event; E\u2013W Late Cretaceous event; N\u2013S Paleogene event).

Agricultural Extension has a role to play in assisting farmers in complying with water quality regulations and adoption of Best Management Practices (BMP) to address water quality impacts. Despite the clear importance of financial information in BMP decision-making, often, published cost assessments are rare and lack transparency. This article provides a framework for Extension personnel who provide water quality BMP cost assessments while also highlighting financial information necessary for creating Extension publications that have transparent and dynamic financial assessments. Introduction A key environmental indicator of sustainability in agricultural landscapes is water quality, which is deteriorating throughout the U.S. Cornbelt. This is largely due to nutrient and sediment loading in surface waters driven by agricultural land use (Christianson & Tyndall, 2011). Compliance with water quality regulations will be one of the major policy challenges faced by agricultural interests in this region for some time to come (Jordan et al., 2011). More broadly speaking, farmers are also expected to be stewards of our collective natural resource base in the U.S. (Harrison, 2002). Assisting farmers in complying with water quality regulations or enacting voluntary measures on farms in order to proactively address water quality impacts will continue to be an important and growing role for Extension. Within the U.S. Cornbelt, 95% of agricultural land is privately owned by hundreds of thousands of different individuals (USDA NASS, 2002). Therefore the regional capacity to prevent and/or mitigate water quality impacts while also addressing other environmental issues of concern (e.g., diminished biodiversity) will largely be dependent on environmentally focused management by many farmers across the region (Swinton, 2008). Specifically, the adoption of effective non-point source Best Management Practices (BMPs) will be paramount to ensuring measurable improvements in water quality and other conservation goals. BMPs referred to in this article are conservation or production practices used singularly or in combination that effectively and practically prevent or mitigate non-point source pollution (e.g., nutrient and sediment runoff) that results from row-crop agriculture. Water quality oriented BMPs commonly used in row-crop landscapes are either cultural or structural in nature (Ritter& Shirmohammaddi, 2001). Cultural BMPs are characterized by in-field practices that often minimize or John Tyndall Assistant Professor jtyndall@iastate.edu Gabrielle E. Roesch Ph.D. Student geroesch@iastate.edu Iowa State University Ames, Iowa prevent erosion or nutrient transport at the field level, such as conservation tillage or nutrient management. Structural BMPs are typically land-based installations designed to capture, buffer, or otherwise treat sediment or nutrients before reaching water. Structural BMPs involve various kinds of natural or artificial structures that are placed within or at field-edges and often featuring perennial vegetation and/or landform engineering that is generally considered permanent (or quasi-permanent). Examples of structural BMPs commonly used in the Cornbelt region are vegetative filter strips, terraces, constructed/restored wetlands, and riparian buffers. The focus of this article is on structural BMPs. Table 1 summarizes five different structural water quality BMPs that are increasingly used in this region. Table 1.

Note: Information included is general use characteristics of each BMP as designated by the Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) and basic cost parameters. As typically noted in Extension materials regarding farmer use of BMPs (e.g., Brown, Boone, Nokes, & Ward, 1991), before farmers choose one or several BMPs to implement, they should consider a balance between three factors: 1) the bio-physical effectiveness of the BMP in performing its intended field-level task; 2) the compatibility of the practice relative to the current operation in terms of equipment and time/labor availability, etc.; and 3) the financial feasibility of the BMP relative to farmer willingness to pay and/or alternative management options. The main purpose of this article is to focus on how Extension personnel can more systematically assess the financial aspects of BMP implementation. Farmers who are interested in using BMPs should be given transparent financial information in order to weigh potential costs and benefits of a BMP option. Extension personnel need to be able to provide consistent, transparent, and updateable farm-level financial information regarding the technologies they are in effect \"extending\" to users. Despite the clear importance of financial information in BMP decision-making, for many specific BMPs, published cost assessments are rare, and those that are available often lack transparency. Critical information that is often lacking includes a full presentation of cost parameters, the timing of typical cost events, and the discount rate used, as well as the reason for the selected rate and, often most critically, the choice/value of opportunity costs accounted for (Afari-Sefa, Yiridoe, Gordon, & Hebb, 2008; Christianson, 2011). The purpose of this article is two-fold: 1) provide an analytical framework to Extension personnel who are, or will be, providing water quality BMP cost assessments as part of their Extension programming; 2) highlight the key financial information to provide in Extension publications so as to make such financial assessments more transparent and dynamic, and ultimately more effective in guiding BMP adoption among landowners. Discounted Cash-Flow Analysis: The Basics BMPs involve upfront \"base capital,\" annual and periodic costs and may involve payments (or revenues) over time. Analyzing such cash-flows requires a discounted cash-flow framework. That is, all future costs/revenues are discounted to the present time (present value) so as to appropriately account for the time-value of capital (money). Discounted Cash-Flow (DCF) assessments generally involve fairly straightforward Feature Agricultural Water Quality BMPs: A Standardized Approach to Financial Analysis JOE 52(3) \u00a92014 Extension Journal Inc. 3", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "e33d9a7104d42e597a1beaa0ba5a81f0fb337bec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3164114626", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3823496", "CorpusId": 236677202}, "title": "A Feasibility Study of Full Scale, Post Combustion, Amine Based, CO 2 Capture Retrofit Application in the Cement Manufacturing Sector at the Lehigh Hanson Materials Limited Facility", "abstract": "This paper will present the progress of a feasibility study, jointly conducted by Lehigh Hanson Materials Limited (Lehigh) and the International CCS Knowledge Centre, aimed at retrofitting a cement production facility at Lehigh (Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) with a full scale, post combustion, amine-based Carbon Dioxide (CO2) capture system. This study is a major breakthrough for carbon capture and storage (CCS) as it represents a first in North America for CCS application in the cement industry. The main deliverable of the feasibility study is a Class 4 estimate to assist Lehigh in determining the economic viability of a potential CCS retrofit project. This feasibility study commenced in November 2019 and will be complete in the fall of 2021 and is projected to cost $3.0M CAD. Funding for this study has been contributed to by Lehigh and Emissions Reduction Alberta (ERA) with contributions by the International CCS Knowledge Centre. The study will examine both the carbon capture technology and the \u201cbalance of plant\u201d. Successful completion of this feasibility study could lead to a decision to carry out a Front End Engineering and Design (FEED) study and ultimately to a Final Investment Decision (FID) to implement a commercial scale project. A commercial project is projected to reduce emissions by approximately 600,000 tonnes of CO2 per year. The commercial scale project is projected to reduce emissions in Alberta in excess of 13.1 Mtonnes over a 25-year lifespan. \n \nThe International CCS Knowledge Centre who is providing project management and advisory services, has engaged an experienced CO2 capture technology vendor, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) Group, for the design of the CO2 capture system. MHI is responsible for the scope of work that includes the flue gas pretreatment system, the CO2 capture facility, and the CO2 compression process. The International CCS Knowledge Centre is also engaging and directing engineering consultants or other solution providers as appropriate.

Among the carbon capture technologies, oxy-fuel and chemical looping combustion produce a stream mainly containing carbon dioxide (CO2) and water but also contaminants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur oxides (SOx). The carbon dioxide is compressed and separated from water and impurities to achieve suitable conditions for transport and storage. In addition to storage and transport system requirements, separation of NOx and SOx during the CO2-conditioning is required to avoid corrosion issues in various parts of the process. In addition to the emission control measures available for conventional power plants, there are new opportunities for control of NOx and SOx in pressurized flue gas systems of oxy-fuel and chemical looping combustion plants. The work presented in this thesis evaluates the chemistry and process design of NOx and SOx removal during CO2-conditioning in oxy-fuel and chemical looping combustion systems. The primary goals of this thesis are to expand the current understanding of NOx and SOx chemistry and identify favorable conditions for achieving cost-effective control processes. Analysis of the reaction system by a detailed chemistry model, uncovers the importance of pH level in the liquid for the selectivity of the integrated NOx and SOx removal process. Moreover, a reduced mechanism is proposed for engineering calculations of the pressurized flue gas systems that captures the effect of pH and describes the relevant gas and liquid-phase chemistry. Process simulations, which utilize the reduced mechanism, enable evaluation of design of the integrated removal of NOx and SOx in pressurized flue gas systems. Technical evaluation of the integrated process reveals that removal rates of >98% for SO2 and >90% for NOx may be achieved. Moreover, the efficiency of the NOx removal can be improved by the presence of SOx and increased concentration of O2 in the flue gas.

In 1956, Marion King Hubert, an US based Chief consultant and oil geologist predicted that if oil is consumed with high rate, US oil production may peak in 1970 and thereafter it will decline. He also described that other countries may attain peak oil day within 20-30 years and many more may suffer with oil crises within 40 years, when oil wells are going to dry. He illustrated the projection with a bell shaped Hubert Curve based on the availability and its consumptions of the fossil fuel. Large fields are discovered first, small ones later. After exploration and initial growth in output, production plateaus and eventually declines to zero. \nIt is known facts that crude oil, coal and gas are the main resources for world energy supply. The size of fossil fuel reserves and the dilemma that when non-renewable energy will be diminished, is a fundamental and doubtful question that needs to be answered. A new formula for calculating, when fossil fuel reserves are likely to be depleted, is presented along with an econometrics model to demonstrate the relationship between fossil fuel reserves and some main variables. The new formula is modified from the Klass model and thus assumes a continuous compound rate and computes fossil fuel reserve depletion times for oil, coal and gas of approximately 35, 107 and 37 years, respectively. This means that coal reserves are available up to 2112, and will be the only fossil fuel remaining after 2042. \nIn India, vehicular pollution is estimated to have increased eight times over the last two decades. This source alone is estimated to contribute about 70 per cent to the total air pollution. With 243.3 million tons of carbon released from the consumption and combustion of fossil fuels in 1999, India is ranked fifth in the world behind the U.S., China, Russia and Japan. India's contribution to world carbon emissions is expected to increase in the coming years due to the rapid pace of urbanization, shift from non-commercial to commercial fuels, increased vehicular usage and continued use of older and more inefficient coal-fired and fuel power-plants. Thus, peak oil year may be the turning point for mankind which in turn led to the end of 100 year of easy growth, if self-sufficiently and sustainability of energy is not maintained on priority. It may end up a better. \nThis paper describes the worldwide efforts being made to explore non-conventional energy resources such as: solar energy, wind energy, bio-mass and bio-gas, hydrogen, bio-diesel which may help for the sustainable fossil fuel reserves and reduce the tail pipe emission and other pollutants like: CO2, NOX etc.. Also an emphasis is also suggested for the storage of energy such as; battery, flywheel, capacitor devices and storage of air by compressing the air from natural energy sources like: solar, wind and or muscular power. These resources are available in plenty and free of cost and could maintain energy sustainability in 21st century. The tidal energy available in the sea and energy created on account extreme climatic conditions like: storms, tsunami, hurricanes etc. can also be captured and utilized in due course of time if proper diversion and storages are created.

The use of renewable energy sources and diverse CO2 capture and storage (CCS) approaches are among the most actual strategies to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere.

Biomass is a renewable and C-neutral energy source, and bioenergy attracts a huge attention as the most promising renewable energy sources.

The direct combustion of biomass is the dominant conversion process presently used for bioenergy production and about 480 Mt of BA are probably generated annually worldwide (Vassilev et al., 2013). BA is a waste product normally dumped near CO2 emission sources, namely to disposal sites of power plants. This product exhibits promising CO2 fixation capability because CCS is a result of interaction between flue gas or atmospheric CO2 and BA. Therefore, some of the most prospective and economically feasible techniques for CO2 reducing are: (1) to increase the biomass combustion, and (2) direct CCS by carbonation of BA during combustion and post-combustion.

The research of possible CO2 injection in Croatia reached very high level by taking into account several fields in Sava Depression as a part of EOR projects initiated in late eighties, sequestration issues came out in the last two years.

Corrosion dent on global investment in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies can run into the hundreds of billions of US dollars.

A diethylenetriamine concentration of 2.5M , loaded with CO2 with two ratios of mole CO2 to mole DETA (i.e. \u03b1 = 1.2 and max) , 1-2wt% of heat stable salts(HSS) being formate, acetate and oxalate, temperatures of 135oC and 80oC, and a time period of one(1) to five(5) weeks were the parameters for testing. The results indicated that CO2 pre-loaded diethylenetriamine caused extensive corrosion of stainless steel, corrosion was enhanced in the presence of HSS species in the order [DETA + acetate] > [DETA + oxalate] > [DETA + formate], [DETA]. Tafel plot analysis showed that the oxalate systems were the most corrosive in the DETA- CO2 environment with a high of 26.52 mm /yr. , with a relatively high current density i corr = 2.0719095 mA/cm 2 after only 13 hours on stream. Furthermore, the effect of the operating temperature has a significant impact on the corrosion rates. Faster kinetics at higher temperatures results in the quick transport of corrosion species and hence higher corrosion rates. For example DETA containing no acid system, at 80o C has corrosion rate of only 4.587E-06 mm/yr compared to 0.872 mm/yr at 135o C. ICP-MS revealed that the phenomenon of selective corrosion of the elements contained in stainless steel were not present. Surface morphology of the stainless steel specimen done with the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed the following types of surface features: flaky, porous, flowery and layers of corrosion products, fine plates typical of lepidocrocite, cotton ball shaped features typical of geothites, and severe pitting at the edges of the sample. Finally a review of simple mechanistic model was introduced that can be applicable to DETA corrosion and covered key reactions in corrosion of stainless steel in deithlenetriamine-CO2 - H2 O medium. The key reactions being : electrochemical reactions at the steel surface, diffusion of species to and from the bulk including diffusion through porous surface films, migration due to potential (electric field) gradients, surface film precipitations and the accompanying fluxes.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "7f6ece3d6d4dbdaf0d7100b75b0039dd0a556169", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2969855424", "CorpusId": 202179337}, "title": "IMPACT OF CONTROLLED DISSOLUTION KINETICS ON PORE NETWORK MODELING IN CARBONATE ROCKS", "abstract": "Dissolution results in the modification of pore networks in carbonate rocks.

If substantial amounts of CO2 from natural gas reforming are captured and permanently stored, such hydrogen could be a low-carbon energy carrier. However, recent research raises questions about the effective climate impacts of blue hydrogen from a life cycle perspective. Our analysis sheds light on the relevant issues and provides a balanced perspective on the impacts on climate change associated with blue hydrogen. We show that such impacts may indeed vary over large ranges and depend on only a few key parameters: the methane emission rate of the natural gas supply chain, the CO2 removal rate at the hydrogen production plant, and the global warming metric applied. State-of-the-art reforming with high CO2 capture rates combined with natural gas supply featuring low methane emissions does indeed allow for substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to both conventional natural gas reforming and direct combustion of natural gas. Under such conditions, blue hydrogen is compatible with low-carbon economies and features climate change impacts in line with green hydrogen from electrolysis supplied with renewable electricity.

Under the program, the DOE is partnering with industry to demonstrate the commercial viability and operational readiness of technologies that would capture carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}) emissions from industrial sources and either sequester those emissions, or beneficially reuse them. The primary objective of the proposed Project was to demonstrate the efficacy of advanced technologies that capture CO{sub 2} from a large industrial source and store the CO{sub 2} in underground formations, while achieving a successful business venture for the entity (entities) involved. The Project would capture 85% of the CO{sub 2} produced from a petroleum coke (petcoke) fed, 703 MWnet (1,000 MWgross) IGCC power plant, using the ConocoPhillips (COP) proprietary and commercially proven E-Gas{trademark} gasification technology, at the existing 247,000 barrel per day COP Sweeny Refinery. In addition, a number of other commercially available technologies would be integrated into a conventional IGCC Plant inmore\u00a0\u00bb a unique, efficient, and reliable design that would capture CO{sub 2}. The primary destination for the CO{sub 2} would be a depleted natural gas field suitable for CO{sub 2} storage ('Storage Facility'). COP would also develop commercial options to sell a portion of the IGCC Plant's CO{sub 2} output to the growing Gulf Coast enhanced oil recovery (EOR) market. The IGCC Plant would produce electric power for sale in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas Houston Zone. The existing refinery effluent water would be treated and reused to fulfill all process water needs. The DOE ICCS program adopts a two-phase approach. During the 7-month Phase 1 period, ConocoPhillips further defined the Project by advancing the preliminary design, permits, and contracts. In addition, ConocoPhillips was developing a Phase 2 renewal application to seek continued DOE funding for the Project's design, construction, and early operations. The DOE and ConocoPhillips entered into a Phase1 Cooperative Agreement (DOE Award Number DE-FE0001859) on November 16, 2009, agreeing to share cost on a 50/50 basis during the Phase 1 period, with a DOE budget of $2,989,174. On April 7, 2010, ConocoPhillips informed the DOE that it would not participate in Phase 2 of the DOE ICCS program. The company believes that enabling legislation and regulations at both the federal and state levels will not be approved and implemented in time to make a final investment decision such that the Project would be substantially constructed by September 30, 2015, the end of the AARA funding period. Considering current price assumptions, the Project would not generate investment level returns. ConocoPhillips elected not to submit a Phase 2 renewal application, which was due on April 16, 2010. This Final Scientific/Technical Report provides an overview of the Project, including highlights and benefits of the proposed carbon capture and storage project scope, sites, and technologies. It also summarizes the work accomplishments during the Phase 1 period from November 16, 2009 to June 16, 2010.

Two versions of Atlas III are available: (1) an interactive version located at the National Carbon Sequestration Database and Geographic Information System (NATCARB) website The Plains CO 2 Reduction (PCOR) Partnership injected approximately 90 tons of CO 2 over two weeks into a 10-to 12-foot deep coal seam at an approximate depth of 1,100 feet in Burke County, North Dakota, in a DOE-sponsored field test, demonstrating that opportunities to address climate change by permanently storing CO 2 in unmineable coal seams of lignite may be more widespread than previously documented. The field test showed that the CO 2 did not significantly move from the wellbore and was contained within the coal seam for the duration of a three-month monitoring period. In addition, the PCOR Partnership evaluated a variety of carbon storage operation conditions to determine their applicability to similar coal seams, and investigated the feasibility of combining CO 2 storage with enhanced methane production. The results indicate that suitable lignite seams are potential targets for CCS, and that the combination of CO 2 storage and enhanced methane production has the potential to offer both a near-term economic return and a long-term environmental benefit.

One approach to capture CO2 is amine-based temperature swing absorption. During such processes there is a potential for depletion of radiogenic noble gases from the fossil source, due to the addition of a gas phase void of radiogenic noble gases. The influence on the noble gas fingerprints of such techniques is investigated by single, analysed samples with full isotope resolution. This is combined with in-line, continuous noble gas measurements with a portable mass spectrometer [2]. This is a new approach that will provide knowledge of the uniqueness and temporal variations of noble gas fingerprints in the product stream from CO2 capture operations. The feasibility of such an on-site measurement system was successfully tested at a CO2 capture testing facility in Norway (TCM).

Those technical operations have been accumulated in petroleum industry. Recently, CCU has been popular rapidly, since it can cover economic investments and operation costs by producing variable fuels (Verland der Chemishen Industries, 2009). It has been applied to fossil fuel productions using CO2, such as Enhanced Oil and Gas Recovery (CO2-EOR and EGR), Enhanced Coal Bed Methane (CO2-ECBM). The cold oil productions by injecting CO2 into oil reservoirs have been investigated. When the oil is produced with injecting captured CO2, the produced oil is expected to be 70% \u201cCarbon-free\u201d, because it can be evaluated from difference between the carbon content in the incremental oil produced and volume of CO2 left in the reservoir. A next generation CO2 storage technology can produce 100% \u201cCarbon-free\u201d oil (Phares, 2008). When injecting CO2 or CH4 into oil reservoirs, the oil swelling coefficient and gas diffusion coefficient in the oil phase are important parameters to carry numerical simulation of cold oil production. The interfacial tension and swelling are usually measured in parallel, and used to evaluate the diffusion coefficient. Dissolution of soluble gas contributes to cold oil production, as it reduces oil viscosity and capillary pressure. It also causes swelling of the oil, which increases oil saturation in reservoir pore space and subsequently the relative permeability of the oil. Measurements of gas diffusion and dissolution behavior in crude oils are required, since gas dissolution is expected to make increase of oil mobility in reservoirs. These oil mobility changes can be used for cold production by understanding drainage mechanisms. The Laboratory of Mineral Resources Production and Safety Engineering, Kyushu University (REPS) has been measured basic CO2 characteristics in oil, coal, rocks and coal reservoirs. In this review, measurement results of CO2 solubility and swelling factor in oils have been presented in order to propose EOR operations by foaming CO2 micro bubbles in the oil.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "69e6eb64069e6574a700cf7248ac31d4347bdabb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2809016106", "CorpusId": 134413216}, "title": "Optimization of a Carbon Capture and Storage Infrastructure odel Using GeneticAlgorithm", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "2dc87289ff58576e423a6bec50cb15650091d1f9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2732782846", "CorpusId": 168901020}, "title": "Materials for the \"AcceptRis\" exercise on carbon capture and storage (CCS)", "abstract": null, "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "38ef0b580c762b03e16b7e4bd6e857f091d591c6", "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "2101.09150", "DOI": "10.1007/s10894-021-00306-4", "CorpusId": 231693147}, "title": "Potential Early Markets for Fusion Energy", "abstract": "We identify potential early markets for fusion energy and their projected cost targets, based on analysis and synthesis of many relevant, recent studies and reports.

Overall, successful restoration of salt marsh in some estuaries will require addressing additional pressures such as freshwater inflow reduction and deterioration of water quality. Here, we present, a socio-ecological systems framework for salt marsh restoration that links salt marsh state and the well-being of people to guide meaningful and implementable management and restoration interventions. The framework is applied to a case study at the Swartkops Estuary where the primary restoration intervention intends to route stormwater run-off to abandoned salt works to re-create aquatic habitat for waterbirds, enhance carbon storage, and provide nutrient filtration.

The dilemma facing the world today, in view of these data, becomes even more urgent: How to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, accepting that their demand will continue to exist in the coming decades? In the energy sector, many solutions have been proposed to completely replace fossil fuels for electricity generation, such as massive deployment of renewable energy generation and increased energy efficiency. There are many restrictions, however, to achieve this result in the \nmedium term, ranging from technological limitations in the massive deployment of energy efficiency and renewable energies, to the political economy of countries that are unlikely to reduce their oil production And \ncarboniferous as long as demand exists. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) offers an alternative to mitigate CO2 emissions from fossil fuel power plants, considering that, given current and future energy needs, the operation of these plants will continue in the coming years. CAC could mitigate up to 90% of the carbon dioxide emitted by the use of fossil fuels in electricity \ngeneration and industrial processes. Additionally, the use of CAC with renewable biomass is one of the few carbon reduction technologies that can be used in a \"carbon-negative\" mode. If biomass from fuelwood crops were used, carbon could be absorbed and simultaneously generate electricity. CCS, therefore, is a viable alternative to solve the dilemma of reducing emissions while satisfying the growing energy needs of the world.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "ff8d4b460ecd525e3c839ed44176fc4e0e754ce1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2968179591", "DOI": "10.1016/J.EST.2019.100874", "CorpusId": 202228080}, "title": "Preparation, thermal characterization and examination of phase change materials (PCMs) enhanced by carbon-based nanoparticles for solar thermal energy storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "6c542492cb67f46556eedb160da1221fe51cd03d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2059017121", "DOI": "10.2495/ESUS140541", "CorpusId": 140620070}, "title": "Capillary pressure and buoyancy effects in the CO2/brine flow system", "abstract": "The annual emission of CO2 from human activities has exceeded the absorption abilities of nature. Carbon capture and geological storage is a solution that is able to combat the problem of excessive CO2 release to the atmosphere, which endangers the lives of humans and all living things. Saline aquifer, which has a high permeability and storage capacity, has become a subject of interest as a CO2 storage media. The flow of CO2 into the aquifer initially occupied by saline water is the subject of study in this paper. Particularly, the effects of two significant parameters \u2013 capillary pressure and gravitational force have been considered. To solve the two phase flow equation, we have implemented the currently developed mixed and hybrid finite element method. The results show that capillary pressure enhance the flow of CO2 whereas gravity force causes phase segregation with the less dense CO2 flowing upward due to buoyancy forces.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "3d1af6c531ebcb4321607bcef8d9dc6aa9f0dc5a", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/pami/JinGN06", "MAG": "2110401929", "DOI": "10.1109/TPAMI.2006.250", "CorpusId": 8745914, "PubMed": "17108365"}, "title": "Random Multispace Quantization as an Analytic Mechanism for BioHashing of Biometric and Random Identity Inputs", "abstract": "Biometric analysis for identity verification is becoming a widespread reality. Such implementations necessitate large-scale capture and storage of biometric data, which raises serious issues in terms of data privacy and (if such data is compromised) identity theft. These problems stem from the essential permanence of biometric data, which (unlike secret passwords or physical tokens) cannot be refreshed or reissued if compromised. Our previously presented biometric-hash framework prescribes the integration of external (password or token-derived) randomness with user-specific biometrics, resulting in bitstring outputs with security characteristics (i.e., noninvertibility) comparable to cryptographic ciphers or hashes. The resultant BioHashes are hence cancellable, i.e., straightforwardly revoked and reissued (via refreshed password or reissued token) if compromised. BioHashing furthermore enhances recognition effectiveness, which is explained in this paper as arising from the random multispace quantization (RMQ) of biometric and external random inputs", "year": 2006}]}
