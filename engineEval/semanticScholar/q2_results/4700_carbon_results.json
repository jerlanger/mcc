Quantifying the net carbon flux from land use and land cover changes\u00a0( fLULCC ) is critical for understanding the global carbon cycle and, hence, to support climate change mitigation. However, large-scale fLULCC is not directly measurable and has to be inferred from models instead, such as semi-empirical bookkeeping models and process-based dynamic global vegetation models\u00a0(DGVMs). By definition, fLULCC estimates are not directly comparable between these two different model types. As an important example, DGVM-based fLULCC in the annual global carbon budgets is estimated under transient environmental forcing and includes the so-called loss of additional sink capacity\u00a0(LASC). The LASC results from the impact of environmental changes on land carbon storage potential of managed land compared to potential vegetation and accumulates over time, which is not captured in bookkeeping models. The fLULCC from transient DGVM simulations, thus, strongly depends on the timing of land use and land cover changes mainly because LASC accumulation is cut off at the end of the simulated period. To estimate the LASC, the fLULCC from pre-industrial DGVM simulations, which is independent of changing environmental conditions, can be used. Additionally, DGVMs using constant present-day environmental forcing enable an approximation of bookkeeping estimates. Here, we analyse these three DGVM-derived fLULCC estimations (under transient, pre-industrial, and present-day forcing) for 12 models within 18 regions and quantify their differences as well as climate- and CO2 -induced components and compare them to bookkeeping estimates. Averaged across the models, we find a global fLULCC (under transient conditions) of 2.0\u00b10.6 \u2009PgC\u2009yr \u22121 for\u00a02009\u20132018, of which \u223c40 \u2009% are attributable to the LASC ( 0.8\u00b10.3 \u2009PgC\u2009yr \u22121 ). From\u00a01850 onward, the fLULCC accumulated to 189\u00b156 \u2009PgC with 40\u00b115 \u2009PgC from the LASC. Around\u00a01960, the accumulating nature of the LASC causes global transient fLULCC estimates to exceed estimates under present-day conditions, despite generally increased carbon stocks in the latter. Regional hotspots of high cumulative and annual LASC values are found in the USA, China, Brazil, equatorial Africa, and Southeast Asia, mainly due to deforestation for cropland. Distinct negative LASC estimates in Europe (early reforestation) and from 2000 onward in the Ukraine (recultivation of post-Soviet abandoned agricultural land), indicate that fLULCC estimates in these regions are lower in transient DGVM compared to bookkeeping approaches. Our study unravels the strong dependence of fLULCC estimates on the time a certain land use and land cover change event happened to occur and on the chosen time period for the forcing of environmental conditions in the underlying simulations. We argue for an approach that provides an accounting of the fLULCC that is more robust against these choices, for example by estimating a mean DGVM ensemble fLULCC and LASC for a defined reference period and homogeneous environmental changes ( CO2 only).", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "7f097b74da05ac88dcd0717d1dc706b8c8a25525", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1999635394", "DOI": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/KEM.488-489.779", "CorpusId": 108572478}, "title": "Structural Integrity of CO2 Transport Pipelines \u2013 A Review", "abstract": "A recent trend in the development of CO2 pipelines is the shift from the predominance of transport of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) to the transportation of CO2 as part of the carbon capture and storage (CSS) process for global warming mitigation.

Energy security will be affected by such a transition. This paper summarises the main findings from a research project that investigated the synergies and conflicts between a low carbon energy transition and energy security. Energy security can be interpreted in several different ways. Our approach involves studying energy both as an object exposed to security threats, using concepts such as security of supply or security of demand, and the energy system as the subject generating or enhancing insecurity and conflict. Our results indicate that a low carbon energy system can have at least as high level of energy security as the current system, but there will be some new challenges. One is the potential strains and conflicts that can emerge around bioenergy and land use issues. Another is the large scale expansion of variable electricity production, which will require significant investments in new infrastructure. An overlook of institutions and regulations will probably be required to meet the new challenges. The transition period requires special attention; however, since while economic resources and competencies need to be redirected to new, expanding, energy systems, there is a risk that contracting technologies may receive insufficient allocation of resources for maintaining a high level of energy security.

Component temperatures were above 700\u00b0C, but stainless alloys did not have the required corrosion resistance. Experimental alloys developed in the UK were alumina formers, incorporating Ta, W, and Mo as gettering elements for sulphidation resistance. Sulphidation corrosion is solvable, but attack by HCl in gasification environments seems intractable. The supposed materials problems of gasification, plus the complexity of IGCC, have led to them being sidelined for power generation. However, commercial IGCC plants are not dependent on high temperature materials and offer higher efficiency than Rankine cycle steam. Best near term prospects for IGCC are for CO2 capture, but this constrains the type of gasifier. Gasifiers incorporating carbon capture and storage produce hydrogen, or with less capture, SNG. Such systems will supply SNG for space heating as well as electricity, and can cope with the intermittency of wind energy. High efficiency IGCCs will need very advanced gas turbines with 100 bar, 1500-1600\u00b0C turbine inlet conditions.

Quantifying the net C change in forest ecosystems is an important step in understanding and modeling the global C cycle. The goals of this project were: to estimate and compare the total change in ecosystem C over a 10-year period in two boreal forest stands using biometric and eddy-covariance approaches, and to evaluate the year-to-year changes in C uptake. This study utilized 10 years of eddy-covariance data and ecosys model data from the Old Aspen (OA) and Old Jack Pine (OJP) sites in central Saskatchewan, part of the Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites (BERMS). According to the eddy-covariance and C stock approaches, between 1994 and 2004 the net change in C storage at OA was 15.6 \u00b1 4.0 and 18.2 \u00b1 8.0 Mg C ha, respectively. At OJP, the 10-year net change in C storage from eddy-covariance was 5.8 \u00b1 2.0 Mg C ha in comparison to 6.9 \u00b1 1.6 Mg C ha from the carbon stock approach. While both sites were sinks of C between 1994 and 2004, the greatest increase in C occurred in different components the forest floor at OA (14.6 Mg C ha) and in the living vegetation at OJP (8.0 Mg C ha). In 2004, total ecosystem C content was greater at OA (180.6 Mg C ha) than OJP (78.9 Mg C ha), with 50% (OA) and 39% (OJP) of the C in the detritus and mineral soil pools. During the 10-year period of eddy-covariance measurements, there was a positive correlation between both annual and growing season gross ecosystem photosynthesis (GEP) and live stem C biomass increment at OA, whereas no significant relationships were found at OJP. Stem C increment accounted for 30% of total net primary productivity (NPP) at both sites, and NPP/GEP ratios were 0.36 and 0.32 at OA and OJP, respectively. Overall, this study found good agreement between eddy-covariance and biometric estimates of ecosystem C change at OA and OJP between 1994 and 2004.

This could be the case of the synthetic natural gas which can be produced through the Power to Gas process (PtG). This process, originally developed by the German institutes ZSW and IWES, converts electricity into synthetic natural gas (SNG) via the methanation of CO2 together with H2 from water electrolysis. The energy content of the produced methane comes from the primary source for power generation (optimally renewable electricity) and it is possible to produce a CO2 neutral fuel by capturing the carbon emissions from an existing source. In addition, the PtG process can be seen as a new concept of renewable energy and CO2 hybrid storage. This paper identifies the possibilities that the Power to Gas technology offers for the production of sustainable methane and the existing potential for the symbiosis of industrial sectors through optimization of their waste streams of matter and energy. In particular power and transport sectors are considered and the outline of a small facility for the generation of synthetic natural gas from renewable electricity and its consumption in the vehicles of a road freight company is presented as a case study.

Among the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is the most abundant, and thus, limiting its emissions is a key issue to mitigate climate change. In light of this perspective, carbon dioxide capture and utilization (CCU) technology could be used. For this purpose, the CO 2 produced in power plants and industries needs to be captured, before dumping it to the atmosphere. Then, CO 2 is transported to the facilities for its industrial utilization, to be converted into commercial products. CO 2 can be used directly, without conversion, for different purposes: desalination of water, surface cleaning, food or drink production, and injection for enhanced recovery of oil or natural gas. CO 2 can also be regarded as a feedstock by processing and converting it into chemicals and fuels. The main advantage of CCU technology is that it can turn the utilization of waste CO 2 emissions into a profitable activity, as products can be sold. However, this technology has several drawbacks, such as: (i) the current demand for chemicals does not have the capacity to sequester enough CO 2 emissions to contribute significantly to meeting the carbon reduction targets, (ii) using CO 2 for fuel production only delays its emissions, (iii) the \"storage\" in some chemicals is also short-lived, depending on their use.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "867c6cfed8cc971161956dc354ccb62f01327151", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3181035782", "DOI": "10.1016/J.APENERGY.2021.117336", "CorpusId": 237669824}, "title": "A social learning approach to carbon capture and storage demonstration project management: An empirical analysis", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "981abcadbfe19ce9318ad61d5f9b839cf0272a4c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2967234580", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-816229-3.00014-4", "CorpusId": 202191015}, "title": "Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage in a future world", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "ce0502443679f84c4ee80adefdf9e4baaefcf75b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2561744194", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-31655-0_1", "CorpusId": 133148777}, "title": "Introduction to \u201cStopping Climate Change: The Case for Coal and Hydrogen\u201d", "abstract": "There are two grave threats to modern civilization: Climate Change, and Continued reliance on imported oil from the volatile Middle East. Both of these threats can be ameliorated by the development of hydrogen and particularly hydrogen made from coal as a major energy carrier to replace oil products such as gasoline and diesel fuel to power our motor vehicleswith electricity made by gasifying coal (rather than burning coal) with carbon capture and storage/sequestration (CCS). Most discussions of climate change emphasize extreme weather events, rising temperatures and rising sea levels. While these aspects of climate change may be very disruptive, the real catastrophic impact of climate change may be our inability to provide enough food for a growing world population due to the confluence of higher temperatures that reduce food production, coupled with increased global consumption of meat that requires more crop production than eating fruits, vegetables and grains as people aspire to the living standards in developed nations, and the production of biofuels from crops (Biofuels can also be produced from waste products such as municipal solid waste (MSW) without impacting crop production.) that limits farm land available for food production. Powering our light duty vehicles with hydrogen made from coal, and our electricity from a combination of nuclear energy, renewables and natural gas and coal gasification with carbon capture and storage/sequestration (In Carbon capture and sequestration, the carbon in the form of carbon dioxide (CO2) is recovered at the power plant, compressed, and shipped by pipeline to an underground storage cavern where it is buried underground, thereby preventing the CO2 from entering the atmosphere where it would have exacerbated the impact of climate change.) (CCS) would drastically reduce or even eliminate our dependence on foreign oil, (The U.S. petroleum production is sufficient to supply all non-transportation oil requirements.) and, if the rest of the world follows our lead, could eliminate the influence of OPEC and our dependence oil imported from the volatile Middle East, and this approach would allow us to meet the climate change goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 while relying primarily on our huge inventory of domestic coal to supply both hydrogen and electricity. Many advocates of using hydrogen as a zero-emission energy carrier envision a future where hydrogen is produced by electrolyzing water using renewable energy. While this vision of a renewable hydrogen economy may be a long-term goal for society, it might be too costly or take too long to make the transition from our current predominantly coal- and natural gas-based electricity generation system and our nearly total dependence on oil products for transportation to an all-renewable future in the next few decades. This book therefore explores a more plausible transition strategy using coal, natural gas, renewable and nuclear power as the primary sources of energy over the next few decades as a practical pathway toward a renewable hydrogen future. Making hydrogen from renewables by electrolyzing water also raises the issue of water resources. It may be necessary to develop technologies to electrolyze sea water to make renewable hydrogen a sustainable long-term option with respect to water utilization.In the near term, hydrogen made from coal offers an alternative less dependent on our planet\u2019s limited freshwater resources. While this book is focused primarily on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from electricity power plants, we also explore the option of jump-starting a near zero-emission hydrogen-powered fuel cell electric vehicle (FCEV) transportation system by installing \u201cTri-Generation\u201d fueling stations at warehouses, distribution centers and \u201cbig box stores.\u201d These \u201cTri-Gen\u201d stations generate three energy carriers made from natural gas: hydrogen, electricity and heat; Chap. 7 demonstrates that such distributed \u201cTri-Gen\u201d stations would provide a significant return on investment in Hawaii, California and the Eastern portion of the United States by displacing expensive electricity at the stores, thereby allowing the profitable introduction of hydrogen fueling stations to ramp up the introduction of zero emission FCEVs in the nation\u2019s vehicle fleet.

The model was successfully validated through a comparison of the predicted vapor- and liquid-phase pressures and temperatures against the recorded data from a number of depressurization tests conducted for pure dense-phase CO2 and its mixtures representing those associated with different capture technologies.

However,the urban forest structure,function and role in carbon( C) offsets of Chinese urban forests are little understood. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the C storage and sequestration by urban forests and C emissions from energy consumption by urban energy consumption in Guangzhou,and analyse the effect of urban forests offsetting the C emissions from energy use. This paper also discussed the relationship between urban low carbon development and forest C sink,and explored the management practices for improving Guangzhou's urban forest function of offsetting C emissions. Guangzhou is located in north side of the Pearl River,along southeastern coast of China. The forests in Guangzhou includes five main types: Eucalyptus,Plus massoniana,Cunninghamia lanceolata,economic forest and evergreen broad-leaved forest. C storage and sequestration were quantified using urban forest inventory data and by applying volume-derived biomass equations and other models related to net primary productivity( NPP). C emissions from urban energy use were estimated by accounting for fossil fuel use and C emission factors. Total C storage by Guangzhou's urban forests was estimated at 654. 42\u00d7104t,and average C density was 28. 81 t / hm2. C storage in different districts ranged from1. 50 \u00d7104t to 354. 99 \u00d7104t,as in the following order: ConghuaZengchengHuaduBaiyunLuogangPanyuTianheHuangpu. C storage of evergreen broad-leaved forest and young age class forest were respectively 530. 67\u00d7104t and 271. 86\u00d7104t,which had played a chief role in forest total C storage in terms of forest type and age class. C sequestration by urban forests was 658,732 t / a,with an average C sequestration rate was 2. 90 t\u00b7hm-2\u00b7a-1. The spatial distribution of C sequestration in Guangzhou was imbalanced: most of C was sequestrated in exurb just like Conghua and Zengcheng. The C sequestration percentages of Eucalyptus,Plus massoniana,Cunninghamia lanceolata,economic forest and evergreen broadleaved forest were 6. 25%,8. 13%,3. 67%,1. 48% and 82. 25% respectively. C sequestration rate decreased with increasing forest age. For Eucalyptus,C sequestration for young,middle-aged,premature,mature and post-mature forests decreased with age from 3. 06 t\u00b7hm-2\u00b7a-1to 2. 35 t\u00b7hm-2\u00b7a-1. Results were similar for Plus massoniana which decreased from 1. 99 t\u00b7hm-2\u00b7a-1to 1. 34 t\u00b7hm-2\u00b7a-1,for Cunninghamia lanceolata from 4. 06 t\u00b7hm-2\u00b7a-1to 2. 61 t\u00b7hm-2\u00b7a-1,and for evergreen broad-leaved forest from 4. 17 t\u00b7hm-2\u00b7a-1to 3. 68 t\u00b7hm-2\u00b7a-1. Average annual C emissions of urban energy use from 2005 to 2010 in Guangzhou were 2907. 41 \u00d7104t. Therefore,the C stored by urban forests equaled 22. 51% of the average annual C emission from fossil fuel use,and C sequestration could offset 2. 27% of the average annual C emission in Guangzhou. Urban forest's C sequestration had a small contribution on urban carbon reduction,but it is still one of the important measures of low carbon development from its comprehensive benefits such as releasing Oxygen,air purification,VOC( volatile organic compounds) management, stormwater runoff capture, building energy saving, aesthetics and recreation. Furthermore,this paper also analyzed the impacts of forest composition and forest age structure on C storage and sequestration of urban forests in Guangzhou,and gave suggestions on improving forest C sink to enhance C offset effect through the forest management.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "ac7f471f74cbafb1eb6a546d45bbfa3b7c33e4e6", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 222175972}, "title": "Nordic CCS Roadmap-A vision for Carbon Capture and Storage towards 2050", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "46db65cbee2c01239c4f4660794638c5ef52a94f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2301487337", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.2749585", "CorpusId": 155694546}, "title": "Too Early to Pick Winners: Disagreement Across Experts Implies the Need to Diversify R&D Investment", "abstract": "Mitigating climate change will require innovation in energy technologies.

The two power plants considered were Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and conventional Pulverized Coal Combustion (PCC). A mathematical model of the PSA process for each of the power plants was developed and the goal was to evaluate the feasibility of PSA as a technology for decarbonisation. The performance with CO2 capture by PSA was compared to a reference plant without CO2 capture and to a power plant with CO2 capture by absorption, which is considered as the benchmark technology. The size and number of the PSA columns were estimated to determine the footprint. For the PCC power plant, the PSA model was a two-stage process consisting of a front and a tail stage. Two-stages mean that it consisted of two consecutive PSA processes. The front stage was a three-bed, five-step Skarstrom process with rinse. The tail stage was a two-bed, five-step Skarstrom process with pressure equalization. Zeolite 5A was used as adsorbent. For a specified capture rate of 90.0 %, the process achieved a purity of 96.4 % and a specific power consumption of 1.3 MJ/kgCO2. The net plant efficiency dropped 16.6 percentage points from 45.3 % to 28.7 % when introducing CO2 capture by PSA. In comparison, the PCC plant using absorption achieved a net plant efficiency of 33.4 %. The results indicate that the current state of the art PSA technology for decarbonisation as an alternative to absorption is not realistic for PCC power plants. For the IGCC power plant, the PSA model was a seven-bed, twelve-step Skarstrom configuration with four pressure equalization steps using activated carbon as adsorbent. The process achieved a purity of 87.8 % and a capture rate of 86.3 % with negligible power consumption. The PSA process did not satisfy the performance targets of 90 % recovery and 95.5 % purity, and due to the low purity it is uncertain whether or not transport and storage of CO2 is at all feasible. The net plant efficiency dropped 12.5 percentage points from 47.3 % to 34.8 %. In comparison the IGCC plant with absorption achieved a net plant efficiency of 36.4 %. The results showed that PSA as a capture technology for IGCC power plants could not perform quite as well as absorption. However, PSA as a capture technology could have a potential if the purity could be increased, and is therefore more promising than PSA for PCC power plants.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "1c845fa60e74dc58f30c88776c9647bd19b07914", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3164491746", "DOI": "10.1002/GHG.2082", "CorpusId": 236350862}, "title": "Carbon capture, utilization, and storage hub development on the Gulf Coast", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "2ff652429f62906c69cbb2ef55ba4d1a971ef264", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2465768792", "CorpusId": 132032290}, "title": "without negative emissions from bioenergy AND CO2 capture and storage", "abstract": "Abstract Combining bioenergy and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture and storage (CCS)technologies (BECCS) has the potential to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere whileproducing useful energy.

Historically, alterations to the original morphological and hydrological characteristics of some these ecosystems have increased their trophic status, which could influence the carbon (C) balance, while other ecosystems remain close to their natural condition. In this work, the main processes related to the C cycle were studied in several Mediterranean coastal marshes with different degrees of alteration and in sites restored and managed in different ways. Carbon associated with greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) was determined using gas exchange methods for plankton, benthos, and sediments, as well as net production estimations for helophytes, to determine the influence of wetland conservation status, restoration, and management practices on C balances. Freshwater and brackish marshes showed capacity for C capture, especially in the restored sites (\u223c950\u2005\u2005g m\u22122 yr\u22121), with a paramount role of helophytes. Differences among the study sites revealed the importance of alterations and restoration for C exchange.

Currently, fossil fuels (Coal, Oil and Natural Gas) supply over 85 % of the world\u2019s commercial energy, account for 65 percent of the world\u2019s electricity and 97 % of the energy for transportation. For countries like India and China where coal is the main stay of their power generation, the production and use of fossil fuels contribute to 64 percent of anthropogenic Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. World wide and fossil fuel power generation currently accounts for over one third of global annual carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions. Now, it is therefore imperative to develop technology for low carbon based power generation together with the techniques to capture CO 2 being released into atmosphere continuously and then compress it for storage. For this purpose CO 2 need to be compressed, prior to storage and transportation. After separating and compressing CO 2 from combustion stack gases, liquid CO 2 can be transported and discharged into the bottom of the ocean and stored either in geological formations, or in the form of dry ice, or fixed by in situ lakes of algae or converted to benign solid materials/fuels, through biological or chemical materials/fuels, through biological or chemical processes. Sequestration of CO 2 could be modified or suitably altered to encompass production of multipurpose fuels like hydrogen, methane and biodiesel. This Project is under NPCS scheme of DST, government of India. A pilot plant is being developed at RGTU for capture of CO 2 and converting the same into useful fuel like hydrogen for fuel cell application, methane for methane based turbine for power generation and biodiesel through algae route. The total capacity of plant is 500 kg/day of CO 2 . The systems being incorporated include CO 2 sequestration system, Catalytic Flash Reduction of CO 2 using charcoal from gasifier, production of methane using catalytic converter and simultaneous capture of CO 2 using solar flux and CO 2 as input to the algae culture. Algae yield can then be used for bio-diesel production and augmenting biomass gasifier facility. This pilot plant is being developed for capture of CO 2 and converting the same into useful fuel like hydrogen for fuel cell application, methane for methane based turbine for power generation and bio-diesel through algae route. In order to incorporate these frontier technology processes for commercialization on a coal fired conventional mega power plant, this proposed pilot plant, is considered as a major mile stone. The present paper focuses on CO 2 capture technologies available and proposes a novel concept for CO 2 capture and production of multi purpose fuels.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "ffec05a51a8ff46deb51791723dfa0cf4f3f2c70", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2803045639", "CorpusId": 158743162}, "title": "Making the Macroeconomic Case for Near Term Action on CCS in the UK?

Such variations often translate into tens or, at times, hundreds of millions of dollars in terms of initial financial estimates at the Pre-FEED (Front End Engineering Design) or FEED stages for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects.

Flexible CO2 capture designs could, however, allow CCS power plants to temporarily reduce the level of CO2 capture, thus, in the short term, the energy penalty could potentially act as a \u201cstrategic virtual reserve\u201d that could reduce the risk of fossil fuel supply interruptions and provide extra reserve capacity margin. Furthermore, an upgradable futureproof design for CO2 capture could help avoid \u201cenergy penalty lock-in\u201d during a plant\u2019s lifetime as technology learning takes place. In 2011, global emissions of carbon dioxide increased by 1 Gt, of which 720 Mt of the increase was attributable to China. China\u2019s share of global emissions increased to 24%, now far ahead of the United States, the next largest emitter, at 15%. Overall, 45% of global CO2 emissions are produced from coal and fully half of those emissions are from China, the vast majority of which is used in the power sector. Therefore, CCS, as the only technology that can decarbonize fossil fuels, should logically be central to any plausible strategy for significant cuts in emissions. On the other hand, China is the second largest importer of crude oil in the world in 2012. Even more dramatically, China shifted from being a net exporter to a net importer of coal in 2009 and by 2011 became the largest net importer of coal in the world, though there is still debate on whether China will need to increase coal imports in the future. Energy conservation is a top Chinese national development target, but energy demand will inevitably grow substantially in the next two decades given that Chinese per capita energy consumption remains much lower than the OECD average level even though its per capita CO2 emissions are reaching European levels. Despite these pressures, security of primary energy supply has become a major national priority. In 2011, the Chinese government (National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Finance) launched the emergency coal reserve program that encourages large coal-mining companies, large power generation companies, and major coal transportation terminals to develop a strategic coal reserve. Deploying state-of-the-art CCS technologies in the power generation sector would avoid roughly 85% of CO2 emissions with an energy penalty of 20\u221230%. An aggressive strategy to capture CO2 at, say, 40% of Chinese coal-fired power plants would then lead to a rise of approximately 10% in national coal consumption, equivalent to 1.5 times net coal imports in 2010. In other words, significant extra fossil fuel consumption and power plant infrastructure would be required if CCS technologies were widely deployed. This explains why even though CCS is widely recognized as a key technology to decarbonize the Chinese fossil fuel dominated energy system, there is very limited financial support for demonstrating and deploying CCS projects at large-scale. CCS is therefore not currently a high priority on the list of possible climate technology options also compatible with energy supply security and energy efficiency priorities. The extra energy infrastructure requirement for CCS to meet peak electricity demand could be minimized through flexibility in operating CCS systems (e.g., by shutting down CO2 capture during supply shocks) while the experience curve could reduce the energy penalty in the long term. To do so will require investing in flexible, future-proof designs for CO2 capture power plants. With a flexible CO2 capture design, CCS power plants could temporarily reduce the level of CO2 capture in order to generate more power to complement intermittent and inflexible technologies in the energy system.

Bioenergy (as a potentially low carbon and renewable energy source) is recognised as having the potential to contribute to mitigating GHG emissions and, through utilising domestic biomass resources, can help Britain reduce its reliance on fuel imports and thereby enhance energy security. In order to help guide the UK towards achieving its ambitious targets, a number of forecasting studies have been carried out, each proposing different pathways to securing its 2050 GHG emissions reduction target. The extent to which bioenergy can contribute to future energy supply is appraised, given the biomass resources available to Britain. Analysis of three notable low or zero carbon energy scenario sets developed by, respectively, the British Government\u2019s Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS), the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC), and the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT) enabled a comparative evaluation to be made of each projection and their realism.

Artificial photosynthesis tends to be considered to be an exact mimic of natural photosynthesis, where carbohydrates and oxygen are produced from water and carbon dioxide upon visible light irradiation, since the term \u201cartificial\u201d usually implies making things that already exist in nature. The definition, however, may be too strict and somewhat misleading from a scientific viewpoint. Recent intensive studies on photoredox reactions and catalytic reactions that can be coupled with water oxidation processes strongly suggest that more a general concept should be defined for artificial photosynthesis from the viewpoints of both renewable energy and well-balanced circulation of elements on the earth. Artificial photosynthesis thus should be scientifically defined as a fundamental science and technology that 1) can induce an uphill reaction that leads to energy accumulation as a result of a particular reaction, 2) uses water as the electron donor and the source material, and 3) uses sunlight irradiation. These three factors are indispensable for the definition of artificial photosynthesis. The reaction products should not be limited to reduced forms of carbon dioxide nor oxygen as the oxidized form of water, but include other energystoring materials, such as hydrogen and even ammonia as the reduced products. Hydrogen peroxide and other oxygenated substrates can also be products at the oxidation terminus. The term \u201csolar fuels\u201d expresses more properly the preferable meaning of the reaction products of artificial photosynthesis.1,2 Among various candidates for solving the global energy problem, solar energy is undoubtedly the most probable candidate, leading to a sustainable society with a sound, reasonable source of renewable energy.1,2 The amount of solar energy captured on the globe is nearly 10,000 times larger than the current energy consumption by mankind. On the other hand, the energy density acquired per unit area is rather small (3100mWcm12), with the intensity fluctuating depending upon geographical location, season, time of day, and weather. Utilizing solar energy with such a rarefied intensity and instability should require a sound, strategic decision on whether or not we take an approach to directly go through this obvious barrier or to bypass it, in addition to the simple harvesting and storage of light energy. In this article, the key points in realizing artificial photosynthesis are overviewed.

A stand-alone liquid and gas flow-through setup was built to study the far-from-equilibrium dissolution mechanism of activated, partially dehydroxylated serpentine at moderate temperatures (T ) up to 120 \u25e6C and low CO2 partial pressures (pCO2) up to 2 bar, i.e. at conditions relevant for a flue gas mineralization process. Non-steady state, nonstoichiometric dissolution was measured following dynamics and trends with respect to T and pCO2 that cannot be compared to those observed in literature for natural materials. Up to 83% of the magnesium (Mg) and 72% of the silicon (Si) dissolved within the first 100 minutes.

However, there is a possible risk that the CO2 might leak from under the ground. Therefore, it is important that CO2 leakage spots on the surface of sequestration fields be detected at large scale and on a long-term basis. The purpose of this study was to design a new model to identify CO2 leakage spots through monitoring the spectral change of vegetation on the surface of the sequestration fields. A field simulation experiment was performed at the Sutton Bonington campus of the University of Nottingham to collect the leaf and canopy reflectance of beans, which grew in soil with different levels of CO2 concentration. Visible symptoms of bean stress caused by CO2 leakage may include the reducing bean vigor and the bean leaves turning yellow. The canopy spectra and leaf spectra were processed by a smoothing, continuum removal and first derivative method. We found that, while the CO2 concentration of the soil increased, the sum of the first derivative reflectance in the 500\u2013550 nm (SDg) increased and that in the 680\u2013760 nm (SDr) decreased gradually compared with that of the control plots. Moreover, the newly developed ratio index SDr/SDg can be effectively used to distinguish gassed and ungassed beans at both leaf and canopy scales. Significant correlation was found between the SPAD values and the SDr/SDg indices (R2 = 0.5687, n = 197). This study indicates that hyperspectral remote sensing techniques can be used to detect CO2 leaking spots by investigating the spectral change of vegetation reflectance in the sequestration fields.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "f7da3ce1e510f29fe11ffd0ae8871cb858bffadd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2626481770", "DOI": "10.1080/08927022.2017.1334879", "CorpusId": 104158227}, "title": "Atomic simulation of Xe and Kr separation in silica-templated amorphous mesoporous carbons CMK-3 and CMK-5", "abstract": "Abstract We perform a molecular simulation study on adsorption and separation of the noble gases Xe and Kr in silica-templated amorphous mesoporous carbons (CMK) materials.

The carbon interconnections are not advantageous to the adsorption storage of pure gases, but they can improve the separation ability of Xe for gas-mixture adsorption. The effects of temperature and concentration on the Xe separation are investigated and it is shown that the selectivities of Xe in the CMK-5 materials are insensitive to the two factors.

Urgent questions exist, such as how much land is available for the expansion of agriculture to combat food insecurity, how much land is available for afforestation projects, and whether reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) is more cost-effective than carbon capture and sequestration. Such questions can be answered only with reliable maps of land cover. However, global land cover datasets currently differ drastically in terms of the spatial extent of cropland distributions. One of the data layers that differ is cropland area. In this study, we evaluate how models designed to help in policy design can be used to quantify the differences in implementation costs. By examining these cost differences, we are able to quantify the benefits, which equal the loss from making a decision under imperfect information. Taking the specific example of choosing between REDD and carbon capture and storage under uncertainty about the available cropland area, we have developed a methodology on how the value derived from reducing uncertainty can be assessed. By implementing a portfolio optimization model to find the optimal mix of mitigation options under different sets of information, we are able to estimate the benefit of improved land cover data and thus determine the value of land cover validation efforts. We illustrate the methodology by comparing portfolio outputs of the different mitigation options modeled within the GLOBIOM economic land use model using cropland data from different databases.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "1aa7b35685be0aee668b943b499d1d93a13781a4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1984596046", "DOI": "10.1299/JPES.5.195", "CorpusId": 120593576}, "title": "Technology Development in Electric Power Generation for a Low Carbon Society", "abstract": "Environmental issues are becoming increasingly apparent on a global scale with rising CO2 levels generated by a rapidly growing human population.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a potential mitigation measure. With CCS, CO2 from industrial and energy related sources is captured from flue gases and subsequently transported with pipelines and / or ships to geological storage reservoirs. The main objective of this thesis is to analyze promising transport configurations taken into account economics, safety considerations, and effect of uncertainty on the development of a CO2 infrastructure. The purpose of this thesis is to provide in-depth insights needed to support the development of continental, national or regional CO2 infrastructures. In this thesis, different methods are applied, including: - Optimization modelling for assessing the most cost-effective transport configurations; - Quantitative risk assessment for assessing the economic and spatial consequences of safety regulations; - Real option theory for calculating the value of flexibility and analyzing the influence of uncertainty on the investment decision and lay-out of a CO2 transport infrastructure. In five different chapters, the costs, optimal transport configurations, consequences of safety regulation and implications of uncertainties for CO2 infrastructure development are investigated. This leads to the following main conclusions: - Dense phase CO2 transport is in most cases the best option. For onshore pipelines, the optimal inlet pressure is 9-13 MPa and pumping stations are advised every 50-100km from an economic point of view. - CO2 ship transport has hardly a flexibility value from a chain perspective compared to offshore CO2 pipeline transport. - Uncertainty is a main barrier for companies to invest in CCS. Consequently, uncertainty leads to a lower implementation rate of CCS. - Uncertainty hampers the development of an integrated CO2 network and increase the average transport and storage costs considerably. - Dense liquid CO2 transport is safe if it is well organized and additional risk mitigation measures are not required to comply with safety regulation. In contrast, additional risk mitigation measures are required for gaseous CO2 transport and these increase the costs up to 15%. - From a system perspective, gaseous CO2 transport is only advised for small volumes over limited distances.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "bdb43b6635f8f03f9167baa48b74809dc737c1a9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "248420731", "CorpusId": 91218151}, "title": "Understanding phase behaviour in the geological storage of carbon dioxide", "abstract": "Noble gas partitioning between supercritical CO2-H2O phases can be used to monitor Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) sites and their natural analogues. However, in order for viable application, noble gas partitioning within these environments must be well constrained. Present estimates of partition coefficient for these systems are taken from the low pressure pure noble gas-water experiments of Crovetto et al. and Smith (Crovetto et al., 1982; Smith, 1985). The effect a supercritical CO2 phase may have on noble gas partitioning is assumed negligible, although this has not been empirically verified. In this work this assumption of noble gas behaviour within a supercritical CO2-H2O binary phase system is evaluated using a combined approach of experiment and simulation.Using a specially commissioned high pressure system at the British Geological Survey paired CO2 and H2O samples were collected from noble gas-enriched systems at pressures and temperatures ranging between 90 ? 140 bar and 323.15 ? 373.15 K. These were analysed for their noble gas content using a quadrupole mass spectrometer system developed specifically for this project. By comparing the relative concentrations of noble gases in each phase partition coefficients were defined for the experimental conditions. These were compared to their low pressure analogues. At higher CO2 densities all noble gases expressed a significant deviation from predicted partition coefficients. At the highest density (656 kg/m3) helium values decreased by -54% (i.e. reduced solubility within CO2) while argon, krypton and xenon values increased by 76%, 106% and 291% respectively. These deviations are due to supercritical CO2 acting as a polar solvent, the solvation power of which increases as a function of density. Polarisation is induced in each noble gas within this solvent based on their respective polarisabilities. Hence xenon, krypton and argon become more easily solvated as a function of CO2 density while solvating helium becomes harder. These deviation trends are well described using a second order polynomial. This fit defines a deviation coefficient which can be used to adapt low pressure partition coefficients to allow accurate predictions of partitioning within highly dense CO2 phases.Concurrently a Gibbs Ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) molecular model was iteratively developed to reproduce noble gas behaviour within these experimental systems. By optimising noble gas-water interactions a pure noble gas-water system was constructed for each noble gas at low pressure which replicated published partition coefficients. These optimised interactions were subsequently applied to low pressure CO2-H2O systems where partition coefficients were derived by calculating excess chemical potentials of noble gases in each phase. Again a good agreement was observed with published values. When the model was applied to the experimental conditions however, a poor agreement with the experimental values was observed. Instead simulated values replicated the low pressure Crovetto et al. and Smith datasets (Crovetto et al., 1982; Smith, 1985). This was due to no CO2-noble gas polarisation terms being included in the current iteration of the model. By including this within the model in the future a full reconciliation between the datasets is expected.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "a3d02fc14301332f56a9885df7fb9f0b90e71f38", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2989221771", "DOI": "10.1080/22020586.2019.12072927", "CorpusId": 210272420}, "title": "DAS seismic monitoring of the shallow CO2 controlled-release experiment at the South West Hub In-Situ Laboratory", "abstract": "Summary Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) remains one of the most viable short-term options for halting the increase in atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases.

The upward buoyancy of dense phase carbon dioxide (CO2) in deep reservoirs means that sites need to be chosen with a methodology which has carefully evaluated details of performance during and after the injection process. Standard methods of site evaluation for saline aquifers focus overwhelmingly on the aspects of geological containment and monitorability. Also important to storage site performance is the engineering design of transport and injection. Transport to storage in offshore saline aquifers is normally expected to be by pipeline. There are several proposed methods of CO2 injection, for example as a dense phase, in the liquid or supercritical phase, as water-alternating gas cycles, or as carbonated brine. These result in different migration pathways in the aquifer during the short term (1-50yr) and storage distributions in the long term (1,000 \u2013 10,000 yr). To develop a methodology suitable for making informed decisions for aquifers offshore of the UK, several of these different methods are being evaluated. A chemical engineering and reservoir engineering approach will be used to define some of the important surface transport and subsurface interactions. Important surface features may include the energy balance, location, sizing, materials specification and costing of surface equipment for mixing and transporting CO2. Introduction Fossil fuel combustion produces CO2 which is a major greenhouse gas. Human society seems to have an insatiable appetite for fossil fuels and now consumes about 13 Terrawatts (1 TW = 10, W = 3.2 EJ/year) of energy worldwide, and approximately 80% of that comes from burning fossil fuels [1].

Its increasing share in the Earth atmosphere leads to an increase in global temperature. To prevent the sea level from rising and increased severity of extreme weather, many governments are now trying to reduce their carbon footprint. One third of the global CO2 emissions are produced by fossil-fuelled power plants. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is considered one of the leading technologies for reducing these emissions. This thesis is part of investigating the feasibility of the ROAD 2020 project. This project will be one of the worlds first large-scale Monoethanolamine (MEA)-based Post Combustion Capture (PCC) demonstration project with offshore storage. The power plant in this project is designed so that it can rapidly change between full and part load operation. The combination of the resulting fluctuating flow and offshore storage makes compressing the CO2 a challenging problem. An integrally geared centrifugal compressor train seems the most suited compressor system for a PCC process. However, their operational limitation is their short operating range for compressing CO2 at high pressures. If not properly controlled, this compressor train can significantly reduce the capture unit efficiency. Moreover, possible flow instabilities like surge, two phase flow and hydrate formation could inflict unrepairable damage to the systems in the PCC process. This thesis investigates the dynamic performance of the integrally geared centrifugal compressor train for a PCC process retrofitted to a coal-fired power plant. The dynamic performance of the compressor train is evaluated for different process configurations which include different compressor control strategies, addition of a well control valve and a single and double compressor train configuration. The figures of merit used to assess the dynamic performance are: compressor work, impact on stripper pressure, occurrence of surge and choke, occurrence of two phase flow. To evaluate these figures of merit a dynamic model of the integrally geared centrifugal compressor train has been successfully developed. The model also includes the transportation pipeline and offshore storage well. The open source Modelica language is used for the development of the dynamic model. The simulations performed with this model give more insight in the performance of the compressor train and its impact on the CO2 capture process, transportation pipeline and storage well. Recycle valves seem the most suited solution for the compressor train to extend its operating range during minimum load of the power plant. Simulations show that all evaluated process configurations meet the required performance and guarantee a stable filling of the offshore storage well. However, each configuration has a different power consumption, possible process complications and impact on the process capital and operational costs. To propose an optimal process configuration for the ROAD project a further techno-economic investigation is required. Two future research directions can be distinguished to obtain this goal. The first direction should focus on extending the developed dynamic model with a capture unit model. The second direction should focus on the technology gaps that make the integration of MEA-based PCC processes with offshore storage challenging.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "c2ec7bca62326225991fb8fb7243508fbb0b44db", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2000612052", "DOI": "10.1088/1755-1307/6/17/172010", "CorpusId": 137519783}, "title": "Scaling-up Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) ? from megatonnes to gigatonnes", "abstract": null, "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "e183e0d22c2b851f69bdf2d3e4695018727220f1", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/978-3-030-29337-6", "CorpusId": 209516762}, "title": "Sustainable Agriculture Reviews 38: Carbon Sequestration Vol. 2 Materials and Chemical Methods", "abstract": "The causes of global warming have been subject of controversy, especially in the last 50\u2013100 years.

Although some CO2 capture technologies have been proposed, chemical absorption and adsorption are currently the most suitable ones for post-combustion capture in power plants. In this review, we focus on CO2 capture by chemisorption on pore expanded materials, especially silica-based nanosponges reported in recent research. Under post-combustion conditions, i. e., high temperatures and low CO2 partial pressure, amino functionalized materials show promising performance for CO2 capture. In recent years, several pore expanded materials from clays, silica, zeolites and carbonaceous matrices have been developed to act as support to host amino-rich polymers. Its high affinity (higher than 40 kJmol\u22121) and selectivity towards CO2, mild regeneration conditions (lower than 150 \u00b0C) and appealing CO2 uptakes e.g., 5.6 mmolg\u22121 at 0.1 bar reported, justify the effort on materials and process research.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "931c9930fe8aba9ea9806ce81dafe1c8d64fa694", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "4496785", "DOI": "10.1038/srep12045", "CorpusId": 8023849, "PubMed": "26155988"}, "title": "In-situ observation for growth of hierarchical metal-organic frameworks and their self-sequestering mechanism for gas storage", "abstract": "Although structures with the single functional constructions and micropores were demonstrated to capture many different molecules such as carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen with high capacities at low temperatures, their feeble interactions still limit practical applications at room temperature.

Attempts are undertaken to reduce the emission of this gas through the works on the low-emission technologies of fuel combustion. Another way to lower the emission of CO2 is to capture the gas and deposit it in deep geological layers. One of the options of geological sequestration, next already applied the EOR method (Nagy & Olajossy, 2008; Nunez-Lopez et al., 2008) is pumping CO2 into deep, fully exploited or unexploited beds of hard coal. The issue of carbon dioxide sorption studies is presently handled with regard to the possibility of sequestrating this gas in deep geological structures. Considering the depth of the storage centre and assuming that hydrostatic pressure gradient at the level of 10 MPa/km and the geothermal gradient at the level of 30 K/km (Tarkowski, 2005), it is expected that the stored carbon dioxide will appear in the supercritical state. The supercritical phase shows the properties of a gas with high density, close to the density of fluid substances which changes depending on the pressure and temperature in the range from 200 up to 900 kg/m 3 (Fig. 1) (Holloway and Savage, 1996). The definition of supercritical adsorption which is presented in the work is ambiguous in the literature, due to various approaches regarding the definition of the supercritical phase (fluid). One of the approaches says that the fluid is supercritical when both the temperature and the pressure reach values above the critical point. However, adsorption in supercritical conditions (supercritical adsorption) is commonly interpreted to be a process which takes place in a temperature above the critical temperature (Toth, 2002). The work presents experimental results of studies on CO2 sorption on high rank coal obtained from the Lower Silesian Coal Basin. The table 1 provides selected results of the chemical, technological and density analysis (Nodzenski, 2000). The measurements have been carried out with the use of original volume apparatus designed to examine the sorption of gases in the supercritical area. The developed apparatus also makes it possible to measure the sorption of mixtures (e.g. CO2 + CH4). After the state of balance is established, it is also possible to source the free (unsorbed) phase disturbing the sorption balance. The principle of sorption measurement at increased pressures by the volume method consists in decompressing a gas of a known pressure and volume from the batching space to an ampoule containing a sorbent. Knowing the dead volume of the apparatus and the volume of the batcher, it is possible to calculate the absorbed quantity by means of the gas laws. The presented calculation procedure takes into account the CO2 deviations from the properties of the ideal gas. The gas molar volume for a given pressure and temperature has been calculated by means of two equations: the Beattie-Bridgeman Equation of State and the Span-Wagner multi-parameter equation (Michalowski & Wankowicz, 1993; Span and Wagner, 1996). The figure 3 shows that up to the pressures of about 2.5 MPa, the molar volumes calculated with the use of both equations of state are convergent. In case of higher pressures, the calculated values show differences. Following the sorption isotherms obtained at a subcritical temperature, the thermal equation of sorption (Czepirski & Jagiello, 1989) was used to generate an isotherm in 323 K which was then confronted with an isotherm obtained through an experiment. An unsatisfactory correspondence was found between the isotherm generated by means of the thermal sorption equation and the isotherm obtain in course of the experiment (Fig. 4). The gas capacity values obtained as a result of prediction are overestimated by about 5 dm 3 /kg which testifies to a significant change of properties of the arrangement after the critical temperature is exceeded.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "4f7c18daed9232d5cbdd94b5aa0a19458f4864b2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2360971873", "CorpusId": 101168324}, "title": "Progress in carbon dioxide capture from flue gas by pressure swing adsorption", "abstract": "The disposition of excessive carbon dioxide from industries,namely carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS),is summarized.

This is known to cause not only an increase of temperature, but also a change in our climate. Along with a shift to renewable sources of energy, Carbon Capture and Storage is necessary to mitigate climate change. Power plants are the largest point source of CO2 emissions and therefore, capture of CO2 from such sources is a must. Post Combustion CO2 Capture (PCCC), and specifically absorption-desorption based technology is the preferred choice of technology for CO2 capture from flue gases. It has been extensively used in the oil and gas industry for gas treatment. Its application for CO2 capture from flue gases is not straightforward, mainly due to different flue gas composition and operating conditions. Other aspects such as solvent degradation, solvent emissions and corrosion become even more critical. In Chapter 1, the state-of-the-art in PCCC is explained with further details on the current knowledge and understanding of these aspects.\nIn Chapter 2, the aspect of solvent ageing is studied over two test campaigns in a CO2 capture pilot plant using 30 wt.% MEA. Solvent degradation occurs via thermal and oxidative routes, with the latter being more prominent. Ammonia is known to be a major oxidative degradation product, while the remaining degradation products are known to be corrosive. Therefore, solvent degradation is expected to have a significant impact on the corrosion in the plant and the resulting emissions of ammonia. The link between these three parameters was confirmed using online monitoring probes. Moreover, an autocatalytic behaviour was observed resulting in an rapid increase of the solvent metal content and ammonia emissions. The solvent iron content was above 500 mg/kg, while the ammonia emissions exceeded 150 mg/m3 STP (STP; 0\u00b0C and 101.325 kPa). By correlating the process conditions to the underlying degradation and corrosion mechanisms, online monitoring tools can be used to assess and manage the lifetime of the solvent.\nEven if the state of the solvent is kept in check by reclaiming methods, there could be instances where ammonia emissions could increase. Therefore, it is necessary to have an end of pipe countermeasure for such emissions. Chapter 3 presents the results from a test using an acid wash scrubber for ammonia emissions in a pilot plant test campaign. Several parametric tests were conducted in order to test the efficiency of the acid wash. Moreover, the ammonia concentration in the gas inlet to the acid wash was increased artificially (~150 mg/m3 STP). The acid wash scrubber reduced ammonia emission to very low levels, below 5 mg/m3 STP and mostly below 1 mg/m3 STP. Moreover, the MEA content was also reduced to mostly below 1 mg/m3 STP. A comparison between a model made in Aspen Plus and the experimental results showed good agreement, with deviations only at pH above 5 to 6. \nAerosol based emissions are known to be a concern in PCCC. In Chapter 4, the impact of flue gas particles such as soot and sulphuric acid aerosol droplets on solvent emissions was studied in a mobile CO2 capture plant. These tests confirmed that solvent emissions can be in the order of grams per m3 STP, which is several orders of magnitude higher than volatile emissions. The number concentration of these particles had a direct relation to the extent of emissions. Particle number concentrations in the range of 107-108 per cm3 led to emissions of MEA in the range of 600-1200 mg/m3 STP. \nIn Chapter 5, further tests were performed on the same setup in order to assess the impact of operating conditions of the CO2 capture plant on aerosol based emissions. Increasing the temperature of the lean solvent resulted in lowering of the aerosol based emissions. However, the total solvent emission increased as a result of increased volatile emissions. Aerosol based emissions were observed also for AMP-Pz as the capture solvent. The pH of the lean solvent was decreased by lowering the stripper temperature and thereby, changing the CO2 loading of the solvent. This resulted in an increase in the aerosol based emissions as the activity of the amine increased in the solvent. As the CO2 content in the flue gas was reduced from 12.7 vol.% to 0.7 vol.%, a maximum in the emissions was observed between 6 and 4 vol.%. When a mixture of a slow reacting volatile amine, AMP, with a fast reacting non-volatile, taurate, was used, no aerosol based emissions were observed. This led to the important conclusion that in reactive absorption, along with supersaturation and particle number concentration, the reactivity of the amine plays an important role in aerosol based emissions.\nA Brownian Demister Unit (BDU), consisting of multiple polypropylene fibre elements, can be potentially used as a countermeasure for aerosol based emissions. This was tested in a pilot plant campaign using MEA and is discussed in Chapter 6. The BDU reduced emissions from about 85\u2013180 mg/m3 STP to about 1\u20134 mg/m3 STP. A water wash was found to be effective against vapour based emissions, while the BDU was effective against aerosol based emissions. A BDU is not effective against ammonia emissions, as they are present in the vapour form. From the measured nitrosamines, NDELA was found to be in the solvent in the order of 2000 ng/ml, while in the water wash it was ca. 1 ng/ml. Gas phase nitrosamine concentrations were in the range of tens of ng/m3 STP. The BDU results in a significant additional pressure drop of ca. 50 mbar, for the configuration and type of BDU used here. This translated to an additional consumption of electricity by the blower in the range 26\u201352%. \nA system containing three distinct phases, gas, liquid and aerosol droplets, are complex to understand and model. In Chapter 7, a methodology is presented with which such a complicated system can be modelled in commercially available software such as Aspen Plus. The mass and energy exchanges are split into two distinct interactions, gas-liquid and gas-aerosol. Aerosol droplets are considered to be as bulk liquid without any direct interaction with the solvent. The different parameters that were varied were the CO2 concentration in the flue gas, temperature of the lean solvent and CO2 loading of the lean solvent. The resulting trends were in good agreement with the experimental results presented in Chapter 5. The model did not predict a maximum in the emissions as the CO2 content in the flue gas was varied.\nAlthough absorption desorption based process for CO2 capture is well known, several operating issues needs to be addressed for its application in PCCC, as evident in this thesis. It is important to monitor the degradation of the solvent and deploy appropriate methods at the right time, to minimize its detrimental effect on the corrosion of the plant and avoid high emissions of ammonia. Aerosol based emissions in a PCCC process is a serious issue. The experimental results, proposed mechanism and modelling methodology will enable the design of appropriate counter-measures against aerosol based emissions. It is recommended to devise appropriate strategy and innovative solutions based on the understanding of the various operational aspects of absorption-desorption based PCCC as presented in this thesis. This will increase the confidence level in the technology and lead to its successful deployment for mitigating climate change in the short term.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "3854999a6ac417f167e53701935335643b6fece1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3021545967", "DOI": "10.1002/er.5443", "CorpusId": 218956196}, "title": "Integration of gas switching combustion in a humid air turbine cycle for flexible power production from solid fuels with near\u2010zero emissions of CO2 and other pollutants", "abstract": "This work presents a novel plant configuration for power production from solid fuels with integrated CO2 capture.

The primary novelty of the proposed GSC\u2010HAT plant is that the reduction and oxidation reactor stages of the GSC operation can be decoupled allowing for flexible operation, with the oxygen carrier serving as a chemical and thermal energy storage medium.

The methane\u2013MOF adsorption events are catalogued into energy and space scenario individually. The energy factor includes three types of energy forces for both bonding and non\u2010bonding interactions in variant type of MOFs structures: that is, 1) metal\u2013gas interactions, 2) heteroatom\u2013gas bonds, and 3) non\u2010bonding interactions, including Van der Waals as well as Coulomb interactions. The subspace factor includes: 1) geometrical void fraction volume, 2) surface area, and 3) the limiting local pore size. Under this catalogue, more than 65 000 types of MOFs with relative high gas capture are studied; a linear scaling law can be approached via the group combination of the energy and space factor. Moreover, the decomposed scaling law indicates that for the exploring of high gas storage MOFs structure, the design of spatial geometry takes more importance than the chemical bonding of gas\u2013MOFs interactions. The linear scaling works for other gases, like nitrogen and carbon dioxide as well. This work provides a qualitative understanding for the design of MOFs materials for the gas capture utility.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "effd5762cb1f33cc5ac4f576bc233b7b13309869", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3008164207", "DOI": "10.1088/1361-648X/AB76E3", "CorpusId": 213374993}, "title": "Carbon dioxide gas sensing, capture, and storage potential of calcium oxide surface and single walled carbon nanotube: insights from ab initio simulation.", "abstract": "Single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) and alkaline metal oxide have been identified as potential materials for management of CO2 emission. Yet the underlying operating mechanism is still not well understood, while an in-depth understanding would possibly lead to development of superior CO2 monitoring, capture, and storage devices. Here we present ab initio density functional theory calculations to provide a comprehensive description of CO2 gas interaction with SWCNT and CaO surface. In particular, our results revealed that CO2 is chemisorbed on CaO surface with negligible effect on electronic properties of the absorbent, while CO2 interaction with SWCNT can be categorized as physisorption interaction a process that can be easily reversed using thermal treating of the tube at 150 \u00b0C. Thus CaO is found to be ideal for long term storage of CO2 while SWCNT reported superior performance in CO2 sensing and capture. This work may guide the development of better devices based on CaO and SWCNT for CO2 sensing, capture, and storage.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "79c53cfc8f3a69756012de78eb205b04b2a6fb58", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.47363/jeesr/2020(2)129", "CorpusId": 244751898}, "title": "Legal and Policy Analysis of Carbon Capture and Storage in China", "abstract": "This paper focuses on relevant legal and policy arrangements necessary for the development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in China.

In addition, special attention is paid to the technologies aimed at reducing emissions of toxic substances and greenhouse gases by the fossil-fired power plants. Even though the future electricity markets would most likely depend on the high shares of renewable energy sources (RES) in the electricity system, energy efficiency such as the one based on the near-zero emission technologies might also play a crucial role in the transition to the carbon-free energy future. In particular, there are the oxy-fuel combustion technologies that might help to reduce the proportion of unburned fuel and increase the efficiency of the power plant while reducing the emissions of flue gases. Our paper focuses on the role and the place of the near-zero emission technologies in the production of clean energy. We applied economic and mathematical models for assessing the prospects for applying oxy-fuel combustion technology in thermal power plants, taking into account the system of emission quotas and changes in the fuel cost. Our results demonstrate that at the current fuel prices, it is advisable to use economical combined cycle gas turbines (CCGT). At the same time, when quotas for greenhouse gas emissions are introduced and fuel costs increase by 1.3 times, it becomes economically feasible to use the oxy-fuel combustion technology which possesses significant economic advantages over CCGT with respect to the capture and storage of greenhouse gases.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "0ba4e1c92938fabfc633e0db663f615ff51ff48a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2530630000", "DOI": "10.1111/GFL.12203", "CorpusId": 133383634}, "title": "Bleached mudstone, iron concretions, and calcite veins: a natural analogue for the effects of reducing CO2\u2010bearing fluids on migration and mineralization of iron, sealing properties, and composition of mudstone cap rocks", "abstract": "This study investigates the Wangfu depression of the Songliao Basin, China, as a natural analogue site for Fe migration (bleaching) and mineralization (formation of iron concretions) caused by reducing CO2-bearing fluids that leak along fractures after carbon capture, utilization, and storage. We also examined the origin of fracture-filling calcite veins, the properties of self-sealing fluids, the influence of fluids on the compositions of mudstone, and established a bleaching model for the study area. Our results show that iron concretions are the oxidative products of precursor minerals (pyrite and siderite) during uplift and are linked to H2S and CO2 present in early stage fluids. The precipitation of calcite veins is the result of CO2 degassing and is related to CO2, CH4, and minor heavy hydrocarbons in the main bleaching fluids. In our model, fluids preferentially enter high-permeability fracture systems and result in the bleaching of surrounding rocks and precipitation of calcite veins. The infilling of calcite veins significantly decreases the permeability of fractures and forces the fluids to slowly enter and bleach the mudstone rocks. The Fe2+ released during bleaching migrates to elsewhere with the solutions or is re-precipitated in the calcite veins and iron concretions. The formation of calcite veins reduces the fracture space and effectively prevents fluid flow. The fluids have an insignificant effect on minerals within the mudstone. In terms of the chemistry of the mudstone, only the contents of Fe2O3, U, and Mo change significantly, with the content of U increasing in the mudstone and the contents of Fe2O3 and Mo decreasing during bleaching. \n \nThis article is protected by copyright.
