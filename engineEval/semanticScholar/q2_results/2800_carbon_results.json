Our goal is to determine factors that might help build awareness and knowledge of CCS so that citizens can make informed decisions about it. Specifically, we focus on perceived risks, benefits and emotions associated with CCS and intentions to seek information about it. We surveyed 970 adults from a region of Texas that has seen recent growth in the application of CCS technology. Consistent with prior research, most respondents were not aware of CCS or the risks and benefits associated with it. To explore CCS-related information -seeking intent, we sought guidance from the planned risk information -seeking model, which identifies factors that contribute to intentions to seek information about risk-related topics. The majority of the hypothesized relationships were supported, and the model accounted for 48% of the variance in intent to seek information about CCS risks and benefits. Furthermore, perceived benefits and hope played significant roles in explaining information-seeking intent.

However, fewer studies have been carried out on elevated [CO 2 ] in soil. It is generally found that concentrations of up to 2% CO 2 in the soil increase growth, but that at higher levels root and shoot growth are depressed and the plants are visibly stressed.

This is most likely the cause for an observed global increase in the average temperature and for the changing climate. It is expected that further global warming will have drastic ecological and economic impacts. \nNo single technology will be sufficient to achieve the necessary emission reductions. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is a promising technology which could make a substantial contribution. It is a process which captures CO2 from large local sources and then stores it away from the atmosphere. Storage capacity estimates for deep saline aquifers are most promising. The initial procedure for selecting a few aquifers for a CCS project is called site screening. Aquifers identified in site screening then have to prove their suitability in further investigations. Site screening is a challenging task, since usually few data are available and the prognosis of the complex processes occurring in a reservoir after CO2 injection is difficult. \nThis study aims at improving the insight into CO2 injection processes in geological formations to assist site screening. The criteria in site screening include the estimation of the storage capacity, which should be sufficient to store the long-term production of the CO2 source, and the long-term ability to store CO2 ,which is related to the efficiency of the project and risk arising due to possible CO2 leakages. At first, the statistical characteristics of storage sites in potential geological formations are calculated by analysis of a large database. The parameter ranges and distributions are used to define typical reservoirs and serve as a basis for generating random reservoir setups respecting statistical characteristics. The relation of forces occurring in reservoirs after CO2 injection is analysed by dimensional analysis. By the identification of dominant forces and processes, reservoirs with different parameter setups are compared with respect to their potential CO2 storage capacity and risk. A sophisticated concept for estimating the CO2 storage capacity of geological formations is developed. Detailed, time-dependent storage-capacity estimates are calculated in numerical experiments. The results are interpreted using the simultaneously calculated ratios of forces. The influence of individual reservoir parameters on storage capacity and risk is investigated in a sensitivity analysis. Finally, a risk analysis on potential \nCO2 leakage through pre-existing wells is performed. In numerous numerical experiments, individual parameters are randomly sampled from the statistical parameter distributions and leakage is calculated. A risk surface is derived which represents the average risk for CO2 leakage through pre-existing wells for any site with unknown reservoir properties. \nAufgrund des enormen Verbrauchs an fossilen Brennstoffen in den letzten 160 Jahren, stieg die Konzentration der Treibhausgase in der Atmosphare stark an. Dieser Anstieg der Treibhausgaskonzentrationen ist mit groster Wahrscheinlichkeit die Ursache fur den weltweiten Temperaturanstieg und die beobachteten Klimaveranderungen. Man erwartet, dass ein weiterer Temperaturanstieg zu tiefgreifenden okologischen Veranderungen und okonomischen Belastungen fuhren wird. \nEine einzelne Technologie oder Masnahme wird die notige Verringerung der Treibhausgasemissionen nicht leisten konnen, deshalb muss gleichzeitig eine ganze Reihe an Masnahmen ergriffen werden. Zu diesen Masnahmen gehoren z.B. eine effizientere Energiegewinnung und -nutzung, der Ausbau der Nutzung regenerativer Energien, die erhohte Verwendung treibhausgasarmer Brennstoffe sowie die Abscheidung des CO2 im Abgasstrom von grosen CO2-Produzenten und die anschliesende Einlagerung in tiefe geologische Schichten oder der Tiefsee (CCS). \nDer Fokus dieser Arbeit liegt auf der Abscheidung und Speicherung von CO2 in tiefen geologischen Schichten.

Defined as the \u2018solid, carbon rich product of heating biomass with the exclusion of air\u2019, biochar is synonymous with charcoal. Charcoal, however, is understood to be wood-derived and used as a fuel. Biochar, which still remains a largely experimental concept, is instead used for the stabilization of bio-degradable carbon and the improvement of agricultural, horticultural or forest soils (including, potentially, bioenergy crops). Yet an energy dimension does exist: combustible gases and volatile compounds (oils) are coproducts of pyrolysis that can be captured and used for heat or power. The definition that ties biochar to both a production process and specific use has sometimes been extended to acceptable feedstock or specific use of coproducts (energy). Realising a return from soil improvement at the same time as the superior carbon abatement offered by pyrolysis bioenergy combined with biochar carbon sequestration is attractive. On the other hand, the proposition is new, its implementation challenging and energy security is addressed less completely than by bioenergyonly. It is this conundrum that provides a policy backdrop for this Special Issue of GCB Bioenergy. Field et al. (2013) address the expectation that use of biochar for carbon abatement should be accompanied by benefits to global agriculture head-on. Their model builds, for the first time, specific agronomic effects (lime and fertilizer displacement) into a techno-economic analysis that compares fast and slow pyrolysis and gasification as a means for capturing bioenergy alongside biochar production. In the context of wheat production in Colorado, slow pyrolysis with biochar production provides the lowest price ($50/ Mg CO2eq) as well as the most effective carbon abatement option. Such abatement costs look attractive relative to those of alternatives such as carbon capture with geological storage. Although the modest agronomic effects considered in the Field et al. study are not adequate to make carbon abatement profitable, some soils historically managed with charcoal now display quite remarkable levels of productivity \u2013 the \u2018dark earths\u2019 of Amazonia (terra preta) being a notable example. The characteristics of such soils are not fully explained, but attempts to immediately re-create their properties and performance by adding biochar have underestimated the importance of time and incremental addition to their development (Glaser and Birk 2012). Biederman & Harpole (2013) use meta-analysis to synthesize across the many, often contradictory, findings of individual field and glasshouse studies, with respect to biochar and the productivity of crops. Drawing on the increased range of response variables monitored in such work, they consider not only the relative impacts on yield separately from biomass productivity but also distinguish aboveand belowground biomass production. The potentially important interaction between biochar and fertilizer nitrogen is considered, as well as soil parameters related to nutrient status and microbial function. They make the first attempt in metaanalysis to link, in a generalized way, the response of crops to the type of biochar used. This is of great importance to triangulating between laboratory screening methods and testing of biochar products in field experiments, whether the supplying and receiving crop are identical, geographically distinct or produced from post-use material. At least in terms of agronomic utility, it is clear that biochar is far from a single homogenous product. In addition to the biomass from which it is created (the feedstock), it reflects the temperature at which it has been pyrolysed and probably various other processing parameters as well. Several articles in this Special Issue include important \u2018case studies\u2019 in this context, collectively reflecting the diversity of technology and system configurations involving biochar \u2013 from the perspective of life cycle analysis (LCA), energy yield and product mix, and the impact on soil and crop.

The TEM results show that Al2O3 nanoparticles (4\u20138 nm) are uniformly coated onto CaO crystalline grains, thus effectively inhibiting the sintering of sorbents. After 20 severe cycles, the synthetic sorbent, stabilized by 10 mol% Al2O3, exceeded the CO2 uptake of the benchmark CaO by more than 300%. Furthermore, the influence of Ca-based precursors on the synthetic sorbent's cyclic CO2 uptake was established.

Decreased energy intensity is the most important abatement approach in the CGE models, while decreased carbon intensity is most important in the energy system models. Reliance on Coal without Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is significantly reduced in most models, while CCS is a central abatement technology in energy system models, as is renewable and nuclear energy.

Through an in situ adsorption/desorption process the displaced methane (CH4) is produced and the adsorbed CO2 is permanently stored. This process is called Enhanced Coal Bed Methane recovery (ECBM) and it is a technique under investigation as a possible approach to the geological storage of CO2 in a carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) system. ECBM recovery is not yet a mature technology, in spite of the growing number of pilot and field tests worldwide that have shown its potential and highlighted its difficulties. The problems encountered are largely due to the heterogeneous nature of coal and its complex interaction with gases. These issues, which represent the motivation of this research work, need to be addressed both at laboratory and field test scales. The aim of this thesis is therefore to develop experimental and modeling tools that are able to provide a comprehensive characterization of coal required first to understand the mechanisms acting during the process of injection and storage and secondly to assess its potential for an ECBM operation. In particular, sorption data of CO2, CH4 and N2 on several coals from different coal mines worldwide have been measured at conditions typically encountered in coal seams. CO2 maximum sorption capacity per unit mass of dry coal has been found to range between 5% and 14% weight and to depend on coal rank in a non-monotonic way. Moreover, for a specific coal, competitive sorption isotherms of the binary and ternary mixtures of these gases have been obtained, showing that CO2 adsorbs always more than CH4, and CH4 more than N2. This property is of key importance for ECBM application. In order to investigate the coal volumetric behavior upon exposure to an adsorbing gas, two approaches have been followed. In the first, the utilization of a visualization technique allowed to measure the unconstrained expansion of a coal disc, confirming that indeed coal swells when exposed to a gas that is able to adsorb on its surface and penetrate into its structure, whereas exposure", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "4f5e0cdd2b627605fc6047be5dccab3ae4cd4131", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2065877958", "DOI": "10.1115/POWER2014-32178", "CorpusId": 110614062}, "title": "Technology Choice and Water Consumption for Coal Electricity Production With Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "Water consumption is an important consideration when evaluating technologies for carbon capture and storage (CCS). It may in fact become a critical factor in certain regions where water is increasingly a source of conflict.

This analysis seeks to improve understanding of relative water costs of different CCS technology options. It also helps to identify areas where water use may in fact become a challenge and reveal opportunities for technological improvements that can help minimize these challenges.A life cycle assessment approach was utilized to analyze both the water consumption from carbon capture and storage projects. While there have been previous analyses that have looked at the direct water consumption for some capture processes, there have been few studies that have taken a detailed look at water consumption throughout the complete life cycle of the of electricity production with CCS. This effort expands the system boundaries beyond those of previous analysis while evaluating a range of system configurations to facilitate technology comparison.The range of system configurations considered in this analysis included both pre and post combustion capture systems and multiple sequestration scenarios. The system boundaries for the analysis include fuel production, fuel transport, combustion, capture, CO2 transport, and storage. Water consumption for conventional fossil fuel systems are also calculated for comparison purposes.The results show that while all carbon capture technology pathways result in a net increase in water consumption relative to conventional coal generation, the choice of technology, especially capture technology, can play a significant role in minimizing the increase in water consumption. Integrated gasification combined cycle coal plants with carbon capture were found to be significantly more water efficient than either conventional power plants with post combustion capture or plants utilizing oxy-combustion processes.

The scale of a carbon capture and storage (CCS) program, in terms of land area and storage time, necessary to achieve significant emissions reductions demands a unique statutory and regulatory paradigm to ensure a safe and timely transition from fossil fuels. Deterrents to sequestration are primarily an uncertain legal framework and unconstrained operator liability, as well as environmental concerns. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to regulate CCS under a modified rule of the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s Underground Injection Control program. This approach falls short of the comprehensive scheme necessary. It fails to address longterm environmental and financial liabilities unique to CCS and fails to take into account how existing laws and regulations may impede CCS development. This article recommends that CCS be exempted from key federal environmental statutes and regulations and that a wholly unique statutory and regulatory framework be developed as part of a broader effort to curb climate change.

Assessment dimensions comprise technical, economic and environmental aspects, long-term scenario analysis, the role of stakeholders and public acceptance and regulatory issues. The results lead to the overall conclusion that there might not necessarily be a need to focus additionally on CCS in the power plant sector. Even in case of ambitious climate protection targets, current energy policy priorities (expansion of renewable energies and combined heat and power plants as well as enhanced energy productivity) result in a limited demand for CCS. In case that the large energy saving potential aimed for can only partly be implemented, the rising gap in CO2 reduction could only be closed by setting up a CCS-maximum strategy. In this case, up to 22% (41 GW) of the totally installed load in 2050 could be based on CCS. Assuming a more realistic scenario variant applying CCS to only 20 GW or lower would not be sufficient to reach the envisaged climate targets in the electricity sector. Furthermore, the growing public opposition against CO2 storage projects appears as a key barrier, supplemented by major uncertainties concerning the estimation of storage potentials, the long-term cost development as well as the environmental burdens which abound when applying a life-cycle approach.

Although such a method provides insight into total mitigation costs, it does not provide much information about how to achieve a transition towards a low-carbon energy system, which is of critical importance to achieving ambitious climate targets. To enable sensible deep emission reduction strategies, this study analysed the effectiveness of 16 specific mitigation measures on a global level up to 2050, by using an energy-system simulation model called TIMER. The measures range from specific energy efficiency measures, like banning traditional light bulbs and subsidizing electric vehicles, to broader policies like introducing a carbon tax in the electricity sector. All measures combined lead to global CO2 emission reductions ranging between 39% and 73% compared to baseline by 2050, depending on the inclusion of sectoral carbon taxes and the availability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear power. Although the effectiveness of the measures differs largely across regions, this study indicates that measures aimed at stimulating low-carbon electricity production result in the highest reductions in all regions.Policy relevanceThe results of the calculations can be used to evaluate the effects of individual climate change mitigation measures and identify priorities in discussions on global and regional policies. The type of fragmented policy scenarios presented here could provide a relevant bottom-up alternative to cost-optimal implementation of policies driven by a carbon tax.

Reclamation of minelands can lead to recuperation and sequestration of SOC. The SOC thus accumulated, not only replenishes SOC losses but may also offset additional carbon di-oxide (CO2) emission. The assessment of the above was done on a chronosequence of reclaimed minesoils comprising pasture with topsoil application. The chronosequence consisted of reclaimed mine sites, 0 to 25 years old, keeping 1997 as the base year. The data show that there was a drastic loss of SOC during mining, and minesoil reclamation over time enhanced SOC pools to original levels. The SOC dynamics in soil macro and micro-aggregate fractions and its effect on long-term carbon (C) sequestration are discussed. Introduction Carbon (C) management in the next century will probably be the single most important challenge in the context of the enhanced greenhouse effect. Houghton et al., (1996) predicted that carbon dioxide (CO2) emission to the atmosphere would increase from 7.4 Gigatons (Gt) C per year (GtC yr) (1Gt = 1 Petagram (Pg) = 10 g) in 1997 to approximately 26 GtC yr by 2100. Although the effects of increased CO2 levels on the functioning of ecosystems and energy systems is uncertain, many scientists agree that a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations could have a variety of serious environmental consequences (Barnett and Schlesinger, 1987; Lindzen, 1994; Santer et al., 1995; Adams et al., 1999). Technical ways to manage C include: (i) efficient use of energy (ii) increased usage of low-C or C-free fuels and renewable energy, and (iii) capturing and securely storing carbon emitted from the global energy system (C sequestration) (USDOE, 1999). Carbon forms that can be stored include CO2, elemental C and mineral sources that contain C from known sources. Soil C sequestration is one of the important mechanisms wherein C storage in soil is enhanced and its loss minimized, thereby reducing the rate of increase of atmospheric concentration of CO2. The terrestrial ecosystem is a major biological scrubber for atmospheric CO2 (present net carbon sequestration is 2 GtC yr) that can be significantly increased by careful management over the next 25-30 years (Beran, 1995). Two among the most important sinks for C in the terrestrial ecosystem are the biosphere and the pedosphere. The potential of the pedosphere to sequester C can play an important role in the overall management of C (Schlesinger, 1990; Goudriaan, 1995; Paul et al., 1997; Potter and Klooster, 1997; Trumbore, 1997; Lal et al., 1998; Lal, 1999; Marland and Schlamadinger, 1999; Rosenberg et al., 1999; Rosenzweig and Hillel, 2000). The SOC pools form the largest sink in the terrestrial ecosystem after sedimentary rocks and fossil deposits. It is, however, this pool that is most vulnerable to disturbance. Therefore, practices and management efforts that retain SOC, lead to C sequestration and can bring about reduction in greenhouse effect (Schlamadinger and Marland, 2000). Terrestrial ecosystems, specifically plants and the pedosphere can be effective sinks, though the long-term conversion of grassland and forestland to cropland (and grazing lands) has resulted in historic losses of soil C worldwide (Houghton et al., 1983; Bouwman, 1990; Wallace, 1994; Houghton, 1995). However, there is a major potential for increasing SOC through restoration of degraded soils and widespread adoption of soil conservation practices, an issue addressed by SOC sequestration (Johnson and Kern, 1991; Lal and Kimble, 1997; Lal and Bruce, 1999). In contrast, however, soil inorganic carbon (SIC) sequestration is the immobilization of C in the form of pedogenic (secondary) carbonates, and leaching of carbonates and bicarbonates into the ground water. The SIC sequestration may be the significant pathway of C sequestration in arid and semi-arid regions (Lal et al., 2000). This discussion is limited to SOC sequestration in relation to mine soils (with topsoil application) reclaimed under pasture. Mineland reclamation and SOC sequestration Mining causes extensive change to the original soil profile. During the process of mining, the topsoil (0 to 0.5m) is removed and stored separately. The overburden, which comprises of rock and heavy geologic material on top of the ore body, is then removed and placed into already mined pits. During the process of reclamation the overburden is graded, before the stored topsoil is applied on top of the overburden to a depth of 0.25 to 0.3 m. The topsoil is also graded to approximate the original or adjoining contour of the land. Initial dose of fertilizers and mulch is then applied before seeding the land with a mixture of grasses, legumes and forbs. Minesoil, therefore, is a mixture of soil and spoil or overburden that is being managed and reclaimed. The characteristics, processes and mechanisms occurring in minesoils differ from those prior to mining and disturbance. The land under reclamation essentially remains undisturbed. The land may be put into use after the release of phase I bond, the time period of which may vary between 2 to 4 years after initial seeding. SOC sequestration depends on factors and processes that determine net primary productivity and its addition to the soil body, and those that affect soil organic matter (SOM) accretion and decomposition in the soil. Changes in SOC content reflect the net result of C input (via plant litter) and C loss (via decomposition). To elicit a gain in C storage, therefore, there must be an increase in the amount of C entering the soil as plant residues, and suppression in the rate of SOM decomposition. These two processes, and hence SOC cycling and storage, are controlled by complex underlying biotic and abiotic interactions and feedbacks. Primary productivity and decay of SOM are influenced by the five state factors related to soil formation (Jenny, 1980), many of which are sensitive to management practices. The interdependency of primary productivity and SOC content in the soil is the core of SOC cycling and sequestration (Stevenson, 1994). Realizing the potential of soil as a sink for C requires understanding of soil processes that effect SOC sequestration. Reclamation of mineland, therefore, leads to the establishment of biomass, which in turn results in the accretion of SOM to the developing minesoil. Thus, the rationale of the study was that the temporal changes in minesoil processes in relation to biomass addition could lead to SOC sequestration. Specifically, the hypothesis was that SOC sequestration is a function of time and soil aggregation. Based on the above hypothesis, the objectives of the study were to: 1. Determine temporal changes in SOC content and 2. Assess SOC dynamics in relation to one of the important soil processes, namely soil aggregation. Methodology The study area comprised reclaimed minelands in Morgan, Muskingum and Noble counties of Ohio, USA. The reclaimed minelands are owned and operated by American Electric Power (AEP). Soil samples for 0-15 and 15-30 cm depths were obtained during 1997 from reclaimed minelands under pasture treatment. The year 1997 was the reference or baseline year. A chronosequence of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25-year-old reclaimed sites corresponding to reclamation since 1997, '92, '87, '82, '77, and '72, respectively, were chosen for the study. Surface mining was, and is a predominant land use in southeastern Ohio. Shallow seams of coal were mined in the 1930s and 1940s and voluntarily reclaimed to forest. Current mining technology makes deep mining feasible and economical, and therefore, land that were reclaimed in the 1930s and 1940s are again being mined. Hence, undisturbed ecosystems are rare. Therefore, the reclaimed pasture sites were compared to a 70-year-old marginal agricultural land under pasture, which is referred to as the pasture control site in the study. The losses and gains in SOC pools of the reclaimed sites in the study should thus be considered in the context of the abovementioned control site. In order to reduce variation in spoil (overburden) characteristics, criteria for choosing the sampling sites included similar topography, geologic strata, and coal mining procedure. There were three sampling locations for each of the reclaimed and control sites or years. Within each sampling location, three sub-samples were obtained for each of the sampling depths. The three sub-samples from each depth were mixed to form one composite sample. The composite soil samples were sieved to separate whole soil (< 2 mm) and soil aggregates (5 mm to 8 mm). The whole soil was utilized for the analysis of total SOC content and the soil aggregates were used to determine the aggregate size distribution of SOC. The aggregate size fractions (represented as % by weight) of 5-8 mm, 2-5 mm, 1-2 mm, 0.5-1 mm and 0.25-0.5 mm were obtained by wet sieving (Yoder, 1936). The SOC content of the whole soil and that associated with soil aggregate fractions was determined by dry combustion (Nelson and Sommers, 1986; USDA, 1996). The whole soil or total SOC content was calculated using the following equation (Lal et al., 1998): MgC ha = [% C * Corrected b * d (m) * 10 4 m ha] / 100 where MgC ha = Mega gram carbon per hectare (1 Mg = 10 g), b (Mg m ) = soil bulk density (Mega gram per cubic meter), and d = depth in meters. The SOC pool associated with soil aggregate fractions was calculated as g kg (grams carbon per kilogram of soil). Significant differences in SOC pool between the reclamation duration and fractions were calculated as least significant difference (LSD) with a probability level of \u2022 0.05. The statistical package MINITAB (v13.1) was utilized to perform all the statistical tests (Minitab, 2000).

We develop four scenarios to 2050 with different combinations of high or low agricultural efficiency and high or low meat diets, and use species\u2013energy and species\u2013area relationships to estimate their effects on biodiversity. In our scenarios, natural ecosystems are protected except when additional land is necessary to fulfil the increasing dietary demands of the global population. Biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is used as a means of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere (and offsetting fossil fuel emissions). BECCS is based on waste biomass, with the addition of bio-energy crops only when already managed land is no longer needed for food production.Forecast biodiversity loss from natural biomes increases by more than a factor of five in going from high to low agricultural efficiency scenarios, due to destruction of productive habitats by the expansion of pasture. Biodiversity loss from energy withdrawal on managed land varies by a factor of two across the scenarios. Biodiversity loss due to climate change varies only modestly across the scenarios. Climate change is lowest in the \u2018low meat high efficiency\u2019 scenario, in which by 2050 around 660 million hectares of pasture are converted to biomass plantation that is used for BECCS. However, the resulting withdrawal of energy from managed ecosystems has a large negative impact on biodiversity. Although the effects of energy withdrawal and climate change on biodiversity cannot be directly compared, this suggests that using bio-energy to tackle climate change in order to limit biodiversity loss could instead have the opposite effect.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "8d04c580a00a9a744ff0ec4f858ac6b368eb23e4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2122274869", "CorpusId": 129739689}, "title": "Potential for CO2 sequestration and enhanced coalbed methane production in the Netherlands", "abstract": "This study investigated the technical and economic feasibility of using CO2 for the enhanced production of coal bed methane (ECBM) in the Netherlands. This concept could lead to both CO2 storage by adsorbing CO2 in deep coal layers that are not suitable for mining, as well as production of methane. For every two molecules of CO2 injected, roughly one molecule of methane is produced. The work included an investigation of the potential CBM reserves in the Dutch underground and the related CO2 storage potential in deep coal layers. The latter was also supported by laboratory experiments on the adsorption capacity of coal. Furthermore, an economic evaluation of ECBM recovery was made by analysing the costs of capturing CO2 from major stationary sources and CO2 transport, modelling the production of ECBM using CO2 injection with reservoir simulations and system analyses to investigate the costs (and it's sensitivities) of gas production. Furthermore, the costs of on-site hydrogen and power production (including on site CO2 removal and injection) were evaluated. CO2 sources in the Netherlands have been inventoried. Annually 3.4 Mtonne CO2 can be captured from chemical installations and transported to sequestration locations at 15 /tonne. Another 55 Mtonne from power generating facilities can be delivered at 40 to 80 /tonne. The technical potential of CBM in the Dutch underground is significant: a maximum reserve of about 60 EJ is stored in coal layers up to a depth of 2000 m. This figure should be compared to the current annual energy consumption of the Netherlands (about 3 EJ) or the known reserves of natural gas in the Netherlands (about 70 EJ in 1994). These reserves are concentrated in four main areas in the Netherlands: Zuid Limburg, the Peel area, the Achterhoek area and Zeeland. The CO2 storage potential could be about 8 Gtonne. This storage potential should be compared to the annual CO2 emissions of the Netherlands: about 180 Mtonne. This means, theoretically, that the total CO2 emissions of the Netherlands could be stored in coal layers for over 40 years and that CBM could meet the total national energy demand of the Netherlands for 20 years. However, it is still uncertain to what extent these reserves can be accessed. With conservative assumptions regarding the potential completion and recovery rate of CBM from coal layers by means of drilling and CO2 injection, as well as by limiting the ECBM recovery to a depth range of 500 -- 1500 metres, the 'proven' reserves could be limited to 0.3 EJ and the 'possible' reserves up to about 3.9 EJ. The accompanying CO2 that can be sequestrated than lays between 54 Mtonne and 0.6 Gtonne. Although those figures are far more modest than the 'theoretical' potential, they are still significant. In case the 'possible' reserves can be accessed, ECBM could supply 5% of the current national energy use on a more than carbon neutral basis for over 25 years. Given the Kyoto targets for 2010, or the national targets for renewable energy, this is a very significant amount. Without any subsidies or carbon taxes, the cost levels for ECBM recovery ranges from 3.5 to 6.5 /GJ methane produced. These costs levels come close to the projected natural gas prices in Europe in a timeframe of 10 to 20 years, which are projected to be between 2.5 and 3.2 /GJ. Inclusion of a carbon tax (or bonus) of 25 /tonne CO2 sequestrated, lowers the price of ECBM to a competitive 1.5 to 4 ?/GJ. The cost level of CO2 sequestration through ECBM is comparable with projected cost levels for CO2 storage in aquifer traps(Steinberg and Cheng 1989) in case the CBM would be sold for current natural gas prices. If the produced CBM is used for electricity or hydrogen production on top of the CBM field, the resulting CO2 can be injected in the coal directly (thereby eliminating CO2 transport costs). CO2 removal from a gas engine or a combined cycle is currently more expensive when compared to CO2 from industrial processes that must be transported to the CBM field. But a (SOFC) fuel cell produces a pure and therefore much cheaper CO2 stream. Although SOFC fuel cells are not fully commercially available and have high capital costs, they could lead to somewhat lower costs of electricity. Without CO2 bonus, on site power generation is more expensive than grid prices for the systems considered. But when a CO2 bonus of 25 /tonne CO2 is assumed, power generation costs are reduced below 3 cent/kWh, which is lower than the current average 3.2 cent/kWh. On the longer term, when SOFC fuel cells could become cheaper, on site power generation could become a (very) attractive alternative. On site (smaller scale) hydrogen production gives similar results. Capital costs for smaller scale on site hydrogen production are relatively high, but with a CO2 bonus of 25 /tonne, hydrogen costs could be lower than current production costs from coal and comparable to production costs from natural gas. Overall, the results of the economic evaluation indicate that CBM by means of enhanced recovery by CO2 injection in deep coal layers can be performed at competitive cost levels when the right system configurations are chosen. A, relatively modest, carbon tax (or 'bonus') of 25 /tonne could easily tick the balance in favour of ECBM recovery in Dutch conditions on short term already. However, a number of important (geo) technical and geological factors play a key role in whether these cost levels can be obtained or not. The dominating factors in the costs are the drilling costs. In case the costs per wellhead appear to be higher than assumed here, the economic performance of the system deteriorates. On the other hand innovations in drilling techniques, gaining more experience with the required drilling methods over time and obtaining 'economies of scale' by drilling relatively large numbers of wells in a short time to exploit larger CBM fields may bring drilling costs (and thus CBM production costs) down considerably. Regarding to the geology, the CBM potential and the actual accessibility of the, theoretical, coal reserves and the predicted presence of producable CBM gas in the coal layers is subject to broad ranges. More detailed surveys of the Dutch underground are needed to reduce uncertainties about CBM gas reserves. This can be obtained by seismic research and obtaining more and better samples of the Dutch underground. Such research is absolutely essential before ECBM is developed in the Netherlands on a significant scale. In conclusion, this study showed that ECBM is likely to become an economically feasible option for the Netherlands on relatively short term. It could at least play a significant (and potentially very large) role in reducing greenhouse gas emission levels for a time period of about 50 years. Although the estimates of energy reserves in the form of CBM are uncertain, they are potentially very significant (varying from 6 -- 60 EJ). The potential CO2 storage capacity is (very) large as well (1-8 Gtonne of CO2). Given the fact that CO2 binds well to the coal matrix, that deep coal layers are unlikely to be accessed for mining or other activities in the future and that CO2 storage with ECBM delivers a clean fossil fuel as a by-product, coal layers may be a preferable CO2 storage medium when compared to (saline) aquifers, empty gas fields or in deep oceans. Therefore, this option deserves further development and study. A mix of more detailed geological surveys combined with getting good quality samples, laboratory experiments, system studies on implementation scenarios and a pilot project (with a special focus on drilling techniques) is recommended.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "82af7810020201d4f03fb5c9229c8267b37b3093", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2045972495", "DOI": "10.1163/187601007X00307", "CorpusId": 154739601}, "title": "Transboundary chains for CCS : Allocation of rights and obl igations between the state parties within the climate regime", "abstract": "This article will discuss how transboundary chains for carbon capture and storage (CCS) relates to the rights and obligations of states pursuant to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol (Kyoto).

Permafrost thaw also stimulates plant growth, which could offset C loss. Using data from 7 years of experimental Air and Soil warming in moist acidic tundra, we show that Soil warming had a much stronger effect on CO2 flux than Air warming. Soil warming caused rapid permafrost thaw and increased ecosystem respiration (Reco), gross primary productivity (GPP), and net summer CO2 storage (NEE). Over 7 years Reco, GPP, and NEE also increased in Control (i.e., ambient plots), but this change could be explained by slow thaw in Control areas. In the initial stages of thaw, Reco, GPP, and NEE increased linearly with thaw across all treatments, despite different rates of thaw. As thaw in Soil warming continued to increase linearly, ground surface subsidence created saturated microsites and suppressed Reco, GPP, and NEE. However Reco and GPP remained high in areas with large Eriophorum vaginatum biomass. In general NEE increased with thaw, but was more strongly correlated with plant biomass than thaw, indicating that higher Reco in deeply thawed areas during summer months was balanced by GPP. Summer CO2 flux across treatments fit a single quadratic relationship that captured the functional response of CO2 flux to thaw, water table depth, and plant biomass. These results demonstrate the importance of indirect thaw effects on CO2 flux: plant growth and water table dynamics. Nonsummer Reco models estimated that the area was an annual CO2 source during all years of observation. Nonsummer CO2 loss in warmer, more deeply thawed soils exceeded the increases in summer GPP, and thawed tundra was a net annual CO2 source.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "26c6e424d80ab33a77832e2b094000f04b99b8eb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2114161100", "DOI": "10.1115/ES2010-90147", "CorpusId": 110350144}, "title": "Utilizing solar thermal energy for post-combustion CO2 capture", "abstract": "There is broad scientific agreement that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are contributing to global climate change and that carbon dioxide (CO2 ) is the primary contributor. Coal-based electricity generation produces over 30% of U.S. CO2 emissions; however, coal is also an available, secure, and low cost fuel that currently provides roughly half of U.S. electricity. As the world transitions from the existing fossil fuel-based energy infrastructure to a sustainable energy system, carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (CCS) will be a critical technology to allow continued use of coal-based electricity in an environmentally acceptable manner. Post-combustion amine absorption and stripping is one leading CO2 capture technology that is relatively mature, available for retrofit, and amenable to flexible operation. However, standard system designs have high capital costs and can reduce plant output by approximately 30% due to energy requirements for solvent regeneration (stripping) and CO2 compression. A typical design extracts steam from the power cycle to provide CO2 capture energy, reducing net power output by 11\u201340%. One way to reduce the CO2 capture energy penalty while developing renewable energy technologies is to provide some or all CO2 capture energy with a solar thermal energy system. Doing so would allow greater power plant output when electricity demand and prices are the highest. This study presents an initial review of solar thermal technologies for supplying energy for CO2 capture with a focus on high temperature solar thermal systems. Parabolic trough and central receiver (power tower) technology appear technically able to supply superheated steam for CO2 compression or saturated steam for solvent stripping, but steam requirements depend strongly on power plant and CO2 capture system design. Evacuated tube and compound parabolic collectors could feasibly supply heat for solvent stripping. A parabolic trough system supplying the energy for CO2 compression and solvent stripping at a gross 500 megawatt-electrical coal-fired power plant using 7 molal MEA-based CO2 capture would require a total aperture area on the order of 2 km2 or more if sized for an average direct normal solar insolation of 561 W/m2 . The solar system\u2019s capital costs would be roughly half that of the base coal-fired plant with CO2 capture. This analysis finds that irrespective of capital costs, relatively high electricity prices are required for additional electricity sales to offset the operating and maintenance costs of the solar thermal system, and desirable operational periods will be further limited by the availability of sunlight and thermal storage. At CO2 prices near 50 dollars per metric ton of CO2 , bypassing CO2 capture yields similar operating economics as using solar energy for CO2 capture with lower capital cost. Even at high CO2 prices, any operating profit improvement from using solar energy for CO2 capture is unlikely to offset system capital costs. For high temperature solar systems such as power towers and parabolic troughs, direct electricity generation is likely a more efficient way to use solar energy to replace output lost to CO2 capture energy. However, low temperature solar systems might integrate more seamlessly with solvent stripping equipment, and more rigorous plant design analysis is required to definitively assess the technical and economic feasibility of using solar energy for CO2 capture.Copyright \u00a9 2010 by ASME", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "1f40b0c38113764e35f164d9feb6555992835bb0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2582865645", "DOI": "10.1039/c7cp00199a", "CorpusId": 206077783, "PubMed": "28191584"}, "title": "Sizable dynamics in small pores: CO2 location and motion in the \u03b1-Mg formate metal-organic framework.", "abstract": "Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for carbon dioxide (CO2) adsorption and storage; however, many details regarding CO2 dynamics and specific adsorption site locations within MOFs remain unknown, restricting the practical uses of MOFs for CO2 capture.

The latter have the advantage that they are abundant in many places and provide large storage volumes. \n \nIn this study, the topic of CO2 sequestration in saline aquifers is addressed using numerical methods. A model concept is developed, taking into account a CO2-rich phase, a brine phase and the rock matrix as a rigid porous medium. The focus is on the correct description of the fluid properties including super- and subcritical properties of the CO2-rich phase. Mutual dissolution of the components in the phases and the effect of the salt content in the aqueous phase on dissolution behavior and fluid properties are considered. Non-isothermal effects are taken into account. Advective and diffusive flow processes are included into the model concept. Multi-phase behavior is considered using relative permeability and capillary pressure functions. The set-up of the mathematical model and its numerical implementation in the numerical simulator MUFTE-UG are described in detail. \n \nVarious simulations show the capability of the developed model and give insight into principle processes that occur during CO2 sequestration in geological formations.

The Technology Development Centre for CO2 Capture comprises two different technologies on oxycombustion: Pulverized Coal (PC) and Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB). This paper will focus on the commissioning and testing operation of the 30 MWth oxy-CFB boiler. Foster Wheeler is the technology provider of the 30 MWth oxy-CFB unit, which achieved first fire on coal in September 2011 and underwent initial oxy-mode commissioning in December 2011. Initial commissioning activities have been concluded, and testing has begun. The CFB unit is fully operational and already booked for testing during 2012-2013. The first experimental test runs, including integrated operation with the CPU, are planned for the 2nd quarter of 2012. A wide variety of fuels and blends are to be tested during this time, including local anthracite, petcoke, bituminous coal, local lignite (high ash and sulfur), and biomass co-firing. This CFB unit design allows multiple fuels to be tested either under conventional combustion with air or under oxy-fuel conditions (Flexi-Burn concept). Particular requirements of a testing unit are required, including a wide range of measurement points and the option to vary the operating conditions with the maximum flexibility and versatility possible. This paper includes the description of the facility, the testing program, initial experiences during the commissioning period and results of CIUDEN Technology Development Centre for CO2 Capture in North-western Spain, in particular for the 30MWth oxy-CFB. The configuration combines CFB\u2019s intrinsic advantages (fuel flexibility and low SOx and NOx emissions) with oxygen-firing for CCS.

However, the mechanism of such a reaction is not well constrained, and its slow kinetics is a handicap for the implementation of silicate mineral carbonation as an effective method for CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Here, we studied the different steps of wollastonite (CaSiO3) carbonation (silicate dissolution \u2192 carbonate precipitation) as a model CCS system for the screening of natural and biomimetic catalysts for this reaction. Tested catalysts included carbonic anhydrase (CA), a natural enzyme that catalyzes the reversible hydration of CO2(aq), and biomimetic metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). Our results show that dissolution is the rate-limiting step for wollastonite carbonation.

One of the major limitations of this technology is the energy penalty for the compression of CO2 to supercritical conditions, which can require up to 15% of the plant\u2019s gross power output. To reduce the power requirements supercritical carbon dioxide compressors must operate at reduced temperatures and near saturation where phase change effects are important. Nonequilibrium condensation can occur in the high-speed flow at the leading edge of the compressor, causing performance and stability issues. The characterization of the fluid at these conditions is vital to enable advanced compressor designs at enhanced efficiency levels but the analysis is challenging due to the lack of data on the metastable fluid properties. In this paper we assess the metastable behavior and nucleation characteristics of high-pressure subcooled carbon dioxide during the expansion in a Laval nozzle. The assessment is conducted with numerical calculations, supported and corroborated by experimental measurements. The Wilson line is determined via optical measurements in the range of 41 and 82 bar and near the critical point. The state of the metastable fluid is fully characterized through pressure and density measurements, with the latter obtained in a first of its kind laser interferometry set up. In a systematic analysis the inlet conditions of the nozzle are moved close to the critical point to allow for large gradients in fluid properties and reduced margin to condensation. The results of calculations using a direct extrapolation of the Span and Wagner equation of state model are compared with the experimental measurements. The analysis suggests that the direct extrapolation using the Span and Wagner model yields results within 2% of the experimental data, with improved accuracy at conditions away from the critical point. The results are applied in a pre-production supercritical carbon dioxide compressor and are used to define inlet conditions at reduced temperature but free of condensation. Full-scale compressor experiments demonstrate that the new inlet conditions can reduce the shaft power input by 16%.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "87c9c90ae6039c32e6943d29ab1c60b901ebc20a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3092392563", "CorpusId": 234733320}, "title": "Suitability of the Alberta Subsurface for Carbon Dioxide Sequestration in Geological Media", "abstract": "In order to meet the commitments of the Kyoto Protocol, Alberta must significantly decrease its carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}) emissions into the atmosphere. Major CO{sub 2} producers in Alberta are the power-generation industry, fossil fuel producers, industrial fuel users, the petrochemical industry, the upstream oil and gas industry, and cement and lime plants. Geographically, the major CO{sub 2} sources in Alberta are found near Fort McMurray, in the Lloydminster area, in the Edmonton area, and in the Calgary foothills. A decrease in CO{sub 2} emissions can be achieved first and foremost by improving energy efficiency, conservation, and switching to renewable forms of energy. Carbon dioxide capture in geological deposits and sequestration is probably the most viable solution for Alberta in the long term. This paper presented the results of a study which assessed the suitability of Alberta's subsurface for carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}) sequestration in geological media. There are 5 ways that CO{sub 2} can be sequestered in geological media. It can be done by using enhanced oil recovery operations, displacement of methane in coal beds, storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, sequestration in deep saline aquifers, and storage in salt caverns. For optimum sequestration, Alberta's subsurface must meet a series of criteria including: (1) tectonic setting, (2) regional-scale geology and lithology, (3) geothermal regime, (4), hydrostratigraphy and flow of formation waters, (5) pressure regime, and (6) location of major hydrocarbon reservoirs, uneconomic coal seams and salt beds. The study demonstrated that there are six regions in Alberta with various degrees of suitability and means for CO{sub 2} sequestration in geological media.

Progressive soil conservation has been implemented by the Chinese government since the 1970s, including the largest ever revegetation programme, the Grain-for-Green Project, which began in 1999. Based on compiled hydrological records and organic carbon (OC) data, together with primary production estimates, we evaluated the sequestered OC resulting from soil conservation. Compared with that at baseline in 1950\u20131970, in which significant soil conservation did not occur, the fate of erosion-induced OC was substantially altered in the period from 2000\u20132015. Approximately 20.6 Tg of OC were effectively controlled per year by soil conservation efforts. Simultaneously, the decomposition of erosion-induced soil organic carbon (SOC) declined from 8 Tg C yr\u22121 to current 5.3 Tg C yr\u22121. The reduced C emissions (2.7 Tg C yr\u22121) within the Yellow River basin alone account for 12.7% of the mean C accumulation acquired via forest expansion throughout all of China previously assessed. If the accumulated C in restored plants and soils was included, then 9.7 Tg C yr\u22121 was reduced from the atmospheric C pool during this period, which represents a tremendous C-capturing benefit. Thus, the increased C storage obtained via soil conservation should be considered in future C inventories.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "d0038ac5ba9b9cdde408bbf96e5e2da21bf0ed12", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2478862411", "CorpusId": 132331505}, "title": "Assessing European potential", "abstract": "Once we have captured carbon dioxide from fossil power plants what can be done with it?

However, they still require highly active and stable oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER) bi-functional catalysts to promote their performance. Here, we report the synthesis of Fe,Ni on N doped carbon sheets supported on N doped carbon nanotubes (Fe,Ni\u2013N\u2013C/N-CNT), which shows ORR activity with a half wave potential of 0.879 V and an OER activity of 315 mV overpotential at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122. Using Fe,Ni\u2013N\u2013C/N-CNT as the air electrode, the fabricated primary ZAB shows a high peak power density of 271 mW cm\u22122, and the rechargeable ZAB can stably operate for more than 200 h with a high energy efficiency of 61%, surpassing the conventional ZABs using Pt/C\u2013IrO2. We find that the ORR activity is related to the Fe\u2013N\u2013C species in the catalysts, while the in situ generated NiFe2O4 nanoparticles under the OER conditions are beneficial for the OER activity. Poly(ethylene imine) used in the synthesis was found to be important for obtaining a high performance catalyst and helps the binding of the carbon sheets containing the Fe\u2013N\u2013C sites to carbon nanotubes and also the capture of the in situ generated NiFe2O4 nanoparticles. These results demonstrated the high potential of functionalized carbon composites for application in rechargeable ZABs.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "d2567dde2b5a8876fafe13e94ebd60eb8e20661f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2941144158", "DOI": "10.1038/s41558-019-0462-4", "CorpusId": 150225103}, "title": "Fundamentals point to carbon capture", "abstract": "In 2005, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change published a Special Report on carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). The model results available at the time suggested that, \u201cuse of CCS in conjunction with other measures could significantly reduce the cost of achieving stabilization and would increase flexibility in achieving these reductions\u201d1. Today, energy system modellers interested in finding cost effective pathways to tackling climate change consistently confirm this conclusion. In Carbon Capture, Howard J. Herzog provides a comprehensive, but succinct, introduction to CCS covering the topics that are essential for understanding if, and how, CCS can do what the models suggest. Carbon Capture lays out Herzog\u2019s perspective on the current state of the art methods, presenting an accessible introduction to the range of technology that may be encountered in the field, alongside the broader context (ranging from climate change science to policy and politics) in which CCS is developed and deployed. The analysis is rigorous but the presentation is clear \u2014 and only a minimal previous knowledge of the relevant underpinning science is assumed. Each chapter includes well-chosen examples to aid understanding, and a useful bibliography. Herzog argues that CCS is a \u201cpromising but overlooked climate change mitigation pathway\u201d. Public awareness of CCS remains relatively low and many policymakers are yet to be fully convinced of its value. Arguably, one of the most significant challenges (and opportunities) for CCS is that it is not one solution, but several. Much of the early focus of CCS research and development was targeted at coal-fired power generation. Today, there is increasing interest in the role CCS could play in significantly reducing CO2 emissions from a wider range of fuels (for example, natural gas, biomass and waste-derived fuel) and other large industrial sources (for example, refineries, steel-making and cement production). A chapter is devoted to \u2018negative emissions technologies\u2019 that remove CO2 from the atmosphere, either directly or by using biomass-enhanced CCS. There is \u201cconsiderable disagreement\u201d about the role that these technologies can and should play. If we are able to remove significant amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere it could be a game changer in responding to global climate change. Herzog is concerned though, that \u201cmore and more people are embracing this concept because it excuses pushing hard policy decisions regarding emissions reductions down the road\u201d. CCS implementation uses a wide variety of technologies and draws on a broad range of science. There are several options for CO2 capture. To be effective for climate change mitigation, the main criteria is that captured CO2 remains out of the atmosphere for a thousand years or more. Thus, in general, \u201cgeologic storage of CO2 is the mirror image of oil and gas production\u201d. CO2 is injected into porous geologic formations deep under the Earth\u2019s surface, where four different trapping processes (structural, capillary, solubility and mineral) ensure that it stays there. CCS is unique because its primary purpose is to tackle climate change. Although the constituent technologies typically are not new, Herzog suggests that integrated CCS (CO2 capture, transport and storage) is currently the \u201cnew kid on the block\u201d in energy policy. Economists generally agree that \u2018market pull\u2019 (typically putting a price on CO2 and, hence, creating a market for CCS) should be the most cost-effective approach, but this requires widespread political agreement to introduce and sustain a sufficiently robust CO2 price. \u2018Technology push\u2019 policies are also an option (for example, tax credits in the United States and government-backed competitions in the United Kingdom). Although they are sometimes viewed as inefficient, they have the benefit that support can be tailored specifically to encourage the development and deployment of particular technologies. The broad range of technology and policy considerations is, of course, also a challenge for anyone writing an introduction to CCS \u2014 particularly one intended to be a concise introduction for non-specialists \u2014 but Herzog rises to the challenge. He provides a comprehensive, yet clear, narrative, touching on all the themes that matter in understanding the current state of play for CCS and its potential for the future. In fact, Carbon Capture can be seen as a series of introductory lectures for a general audience. There is a careful balance between personal reflection and providing relevant factual information, typical of a high-quality public lecture. For me, it is the perfect text to recommend to my more experienced students as they look to grasp the technical fundamentals of options like CCS without needing to engage with a full textbook. It should also be essential reading for anyone curious about why modelling studies have repeatedly suggested that CCS should be part of global efforts to decarbonise our economies at an affordable cost. Herzog does not provide a detailed review of this literature, although as he looks to the future he does refer to work by the International Energy Agency, which concluded that \u201cwithout CCS, the transformation of the power sector will be at least USD 3.5 trillion more expensive\u201d2. Overall, Carbon Capture achieves Herzog\u2019s aim of helping people understand what carbon capture is all about. He provides a comprehensive but accessible introduction to key technologies that are globally relevant. This is complemented by insightful review, a useful introduction to key projects where carbon capture can be seen in action today, and analysis of key motives for developing and implementing CCS. What remains to be seen is whether CCS can move beyond its status as a \u201cpromising but overlooked\u201d option for climate change mitigation, to become a significant contributor in reducing global CO2 emissions. \u2750", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "42d88efe33491cd553c437061f6ee3a1f7eeb8da", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2237148776", "CorpusId": 138932934}, "title": "Carbon dioxide storage by mineralisation applied to a lime kiln", "abstract": "This thesis investigates sustainability measures for quicklime and cement clinker production. It is the aim of this thesis to contribute to the effort of creating a more sustainable modus of industrial production.The methods used comprises process simulations through multicomponent chemical equilibrium calculations, fuel characterization and raw materials characterization through dynamic rate thermogravimetry.The investigated measures relate to alternative fuels, co-combustion, oxygen enrichment, oxyfuel combustion, mineral carbonation and optimizing raw material mixes based on thermal decomposition characteristics.The predictive multicomponent chemical equilibrium simulation tool developed has been used to investigate new process designs and combustion concepts. The results show that fuel selection and oxygen enrichment influence energy efficiency, and that oxyfuel combustion and mineral carbonation could allow for considerable emission reductions at low energy penalty, as compared to conventional post-combustion carbon dioxide capture technologies. Dynamic rate thermogravimetry, applied to kiln feed limestone, allows for improved feed analysis with a deeper understanding of how mixing of different feed materials will affect the production processes.
