The probabilities of leakage and the risk of induced seismicity could be remote, but the volume of geologic CO2 storage (GCS) projected to be necessary to have a significant impact on increasing CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere is far greater than the volumes of CO2 injected thus far. National-level estimates of the technically accessible CO2 storage resource (TASR) onshore in the United States are on the order of thousands of gigatons of CO2 storage capacity, but such estimates generally assume away any pressure management issues. Pressure buildup in the storage reservoir is expected to be a primary source of risk associated with CO2 storage, and only a fraction of the theoretical TASR could be available unless the storage operator extracts the saltwater brines or other formation fluids that are already present in the geologic pore space targeted for CO2 storage. Institutions, legislation, and processes to manage the risk, liability, and economic issues with CO2 storage in the United States are beginning to emerge, but will need to progress further in order to allow a commercial-scale CO2 storage industry to develop in the country.

In this study the production of ammonia mainly used in the fertilizer industry and responsible for around 2-3% of the world greenhouse gas emissions is analyzed. Considering natural gas and biomass as a resource and the option of CO2 capture and storage, different process configurations are systematically compared with regard to energy, economic and environmental considerations. A consistent thermo-environonomic optimisation approach combining flowsheeting, process integration techniques, economic performance evaluation, life cycle assessment and multi-objective optimisation is applied for the conceptual process design and competitiveness evaluation. It is highlighted that the quality of the process integration is a key factor for improving the performance by valorizing the heat excess through electricity cogeneration. Including CO2 mitigation in the ammonia production allows to reduce the emissions, but leads to a slight efficiency decrease due to the energy consumption for the CO2 compression. For the natural gas fed process yielding an energy efficiency around 65%, the overall life cycle emissions can be reduced to 0.79kgCO2/kgNH3 with CO2 capture compared to 1.6kgCO2/kgNH3 without capture. Considering the biogenic nature of the carbon in the biomass, the emissions drop to -1.79kgCO2/kgNH3 for the biomass process having an energy efficiency of 50%. The economic competitiveness highly depends on the resource price and the introduction of a carbon tax. This study reveals the potential of the decarbonisation of the fertilizer industry.

The carbon (C) cycle in boreal regions is strongly influenced by fire, which converts biomass and detrital C mainly to gaseous forms (CO2 and smaller proportions of CO and CH4), and some 1\u20133% of mass to pyrogenic C (PyC). PyC is mainly produced as solid charred residues, including visually-defined charcoal, and a black carbon (BC) fraction chemically defined by its resistance to laboratory oxidation, plus much lower proportions of volatile soot and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). All PyC is characterized by fused aromatic rings, but varying in cluster sizes, and presence of other elements (N, O) and functional groups. The range of PyC structures is often described as a continuum from partially charred plant materials, to charcoal, soot and ultimately graphite which is formed by the combination of heat and pressure. There are several reasons for current interest in defining more precisely the role of PyC in the C cycle of boreal regions. First, PyC is largely resistant to decomposition, and therefore contributes to very stable C pools in soils and sediments. Second, it influences soil processes, mainly through its sorption properties and cation exchange capacity, and third, soot aerosols absorb solar radiation and may contribute to global warming. However, there are large gaps in the basic information needed to address these topics. While charcoal is commonly defined by visual criteria, analytical methods for BC are mainly based on various measures of oxidation resistance, or on yield of benzenepolycarboxylic acids. These methods are still being developed, and capture different fractions of the PyC structural continuum. There are few quantitative reports of PyC production and stocks in boreal forests (essentially none for boreal peatlands), and results are difficult to compare due to varying experimental goals and methods, as well as inconsistent terminology. There are almost no direct field measurements of BC aerosol production from boreal wildfires, and little direct information on rates and mechanisms for PyC loss. Structural characterization of charred biomass and forest floor from wildfires generally indicates a low level of thermal alteration, with the bulk of the material having H/C ratios still >0.2, and small aromatic cluster sizes. Especially for the more oxidation-resistant BC fraction, a variety of mainly circumstantial evidence suggests very slow decomposition, with turnover on a millennial timescale (in the order of 5\u20137 ky), also dependent on environmental conditions. However, there is also evidence that some PyC may be lost in only tens to hundreds of years due to a combination of lower thermal alteration and environmental protection. The potential for long-term PyC storage in soil may also be limited by its consumption by subsequent fires. Degraded, functionalized PyC is also incorporated into humified soil organic matter, and is transported eventually to marine sediments in dissolved and particulate form. Boreal production is estimated as 7\u201317 Tg BC y\u22121 of solid residues and 2\u20132.5 Tg BC y\u22121 as aerosols, compared to global estimates of 40\u2013240 and 10\u201330 Tg BC y\u22121, respectively. Primary research needs include basic field data on PyC production and stocks in boreal forests and peatlands, suitable to support C budget modeling, and development of standardized analytical methods and of improved approaches to assess the chemical recalcitrance of typical chars from boreal wildfires. To accomplish these goals effectively will require much greater emphasis on interdisciplinary cooperation.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "4e1ddfad45c3b991e430e002dce03cdd100b25a8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2157844628", "DOI": "10.1039/C3RA44250K", "CorpusId": 97006262}, "title": "Hierarchically structured metal\u2013organic framework/vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes hybrids for CO2 capture", "abstract": "A novel carbon/metal\u2013organic framework composite was synthesized by confined growth of HKUST-1 in the interspace of the vertically-aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) arrays.

The exergetic sustainability assessment method named Total Cumulative Exergy Loss (TCExL) has been used to assess several systems for electricity production, ie, a coal\u2010fired power plant, a coal\u2010fired power plant including carbon capture and storage, a biomass\u2010fired power plant, an offshore wind farm and a photovoltaic park. The results of the TCExL method have been compared with an environmental sustainability indicator, ie, the overall ReCiPe endpoint indicator and the economic indicator named Present Worth Ratio. The offshore wind farm is the best system from the exergetic and environmental point of view. The photovoltaic park is the system with the second\u2010best scores. However, from the economic viewpoint including subsidy by the Dutch government, the photovoltaic park performs better than the wind farm system and the system that performs best is the biomass\u2010fired power plant.

Post-combustion capture offers some advantages as existing combustion technologies can still be used without radical changes on them. This makes postcombustion capture easier to implement as a retrofit option (to existing power plants) compared to the other two approaches.

Renewable and clean sources of energy have been proposed, including wind and solar, but they are intermittent and require efficient and scalable energy storage technologies. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a valuable approach in this area. It combines solar- or wind-generated electrical production with energy storage in the chemical bonds of carbon-based fuels. It can provide ways to integrate carbon capture, utilization, and storage in energy cycles while maintaining controlled levels of atmospheric CO2. Electrochemistry allows for the utilization of an electrical input to drive chemical reactions. Because CO2 is kinetically inert, highly active catalysts are required to decrease reaction barriers sufficiently so that reaction rates can be achieved that are sufficient for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Given the reaction barriers associated with multiple electron-proton reduction of CO2 to CO, formaldehyde (HC(O)H), formic acid, or formate (HC(O)OH, HC(O)O-), or more highly reduced forms of carbon, there is also a demand for high selectivity in catalysis. Catalysts that have been explored include homogeneous catalysts in solution, catalysts immobilized on surfaces, and heterogeneous catalysts. In homogeneous catalysis, reduction occurs following diffusion of the catalyst to an electrode where multiple proton coupled electron transfer reduction occurs. Useful catalysts in this area are typically transition-metal complexes with organic ligands and electron transfer properties that utilize combinations of metal and ligand redox levels. As a way to limit the amount of catalyst, in device-like configurations, catalysts are added to the surfaces of conductive substrates by surface binding, in polymeric films, or on carbon electrode surfaces with molecular structures and electronic configurations related to catalysts in solution. Immobilized, homogeneous catalysts can suffer from performance losses and even decomposition during long-term CO2 reduction cycles, but they are amenable to detailed mechanistic investigations. In parallel efforts, heterogeneous nanocatalysts have been explored in detail with the development of facile synthetic procedures that can offer highly active catalytic surface areas. Their high activity and stability have attracted a significant level of investigation, including possible exploitation for large-scale applications. However, translation of catalytic reactivity to the surface creates a new reactivity environment and complicates the elucidation of mechanistic details and identification of the active site in exploring reaction pathways. Here, the results of previous studies based on transition-metal complex catalysts for CO2 electroreduction are summarized. Early studies showed that transition-metal complexes of Ru, Ir, Rh, and Os, with well-defined structures, are all capable of catalyzing CO2 reduction to CO or formate. Derivatives of the complexes were surface attached to conducting electrodes by chemical bonding, noncovalent bonding, or polymerization. The concept of surface binding has also been extended to the preparation of surface area electrodes by the chemically controlled deposition of nanostructured catalysts such as nano tin, nano copper, and nano carbon, all of which have been shown to have high selectivities and activities toward CO2 reduction.

The paper then reviews the proposals and actions that follow from these criticisms, which fall into three broad categories: scrap the models and use other techniques to set out low-carbon futures; transform them by improving their representation of real-world processes and their transparency; and supplement them with other models and approaches. The article considers the implications of each proposal, through the particular lens of how it would explore the role of a key low-carbon technology\u2014bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), to produce net negative emissions.

According to the IPCC (IPCC Special Report 2018), atmospheric warming should be less than 2 \u2103 to avoid the most serious consequences associated with climate change. This goal can be achieved in part by reducing CO2 emissions, together with capturing and sequestering CO2 from point sources. The most mature storage technique is sequestration in deep saline aquifers. In addition, CO2 can be mineralized and sequestered in solid form by various techniques: ex-situ, surficial and in situ mineralization. Ex situ and surficial approaches may produce valuable products while mitigating environmental hazards. In-situ mineralization uses ultramafic and mafic geological formations for permanent, solid storage. A portfolio that limits warming to less than 2 \u2103 by 2100 will include avoiding CO2 emissions and removal of CO2 from air. Regardless of the specific mix of approaches, it will be essential to permanently sequester tens of billions of tons of CO2. Maximizing the potential of all of these storage technologies will help to meet global climate goals. The research agenda published by the National Academy of Science (NASEM 2019) calls for about $1 billion over a 10-20 year time period to advance deployment of CO2 sequestration in deep sedimentary reservoirs at the GtCO2/yr scale and develop CO2 mineralization at the MtCO2/yr scale.

Methane leakage rate, efficiency penalty, carbon dioxide (CO2) capture rate, and natural gas price are found to be the strongest factors influencing optimal NGCC-CCS deployment, in that order. NGCC plays an important role in meeting mid-term GHG targets across all model runs. A large portion of NGCC capacity is later retrofit with CCS, indicating that NGCC can be both a bridge to a low-carbon future and an integral part of that future. Thus, retrofitability and siting near CO2 storage should be considerations as new NGCC capacity is built. Regional results indicate that NGCC-CCS deployment would be greatest in the West South Central region, followed by the East North Central region.

Within the Basin, underlying most of Illinois, western Indiana, and western Kentucky, are relatively deeper and/or thinner coal resources, numerous mature oil fields, and deep salt-water-bearing reservoirs that are potentially capable of storing CO{sub 2}. The objective of this Assessment was to determine the technical and economic feasibility of using these geological sinks for long-term storage to avoid atmospheric release of CO{sub 2} from fossil fuel combustion and thereby avoid the potential for adverse climate change. The MGSC is a consortium of the geological surveys of Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky joined by six private corporations, five professional business associations, one interstate compact, two university researchers, two Illinois state agencies, and two consultants. The purpose of the Consortium is to assess carbon capture, transportation, and storage processes and their costs and viability in the three-state Illinois Basin region. The Illinois State Geological Survey serves as Lead Technical Contractor for the Consortium. The Illinois Basin region has annual emissions from stationary anthropogenic sources exceeding 276 million metric tonnes (304 million tons) of CO{sub 2} (>70 million tonnes (77 million tons) carbon equivalent), primarily from coal-fired electric generation facilities, some of which burn almost 4.5 million tonnes (5 million tons) of coal per year. Assessing the options for capture, transportation, and storage of the CO{sub 2} emissions within the region has been a 12-task, 2-year process that has assessed 3,600 million tonnes (3,968 million tons) of storage capacity in coal seams, 140 to 440 million tonnes (154 to 485 million tons) of capacity in mature oil reservoirs, 7,800 million tonnes (8,598 million tons) of capacity in saline reservoirs deep beneath geological structures, and 30,000 to 35,000 million tonnes (33,069 to 38,580 million tons) of capacity in saline reservoirs on a regional dip >1,219 m (4,000 ft) deep.

A review of manure management mitigation options.", "abstract": "This review analyzes published data on manure management practices used to mitigate methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from animal operations. Reducing excreted nitrogen (N) and degradable organic carbon (C) by diet manipulation to improve the balance of nutrient inputs with production is an effective practice to reduce CH4 and N2O emissions. Most CH4 is produced during manure storage; therefore, reducing storage time, lowering manure temperature by storing it outside during colder seasons, and capturing and combusting the CH4 produced during storage are effective practices to reduce CH4 emission. Anaerobic digestion with combustion of the gas produced is effective in reducing CH4 emission and organic C content of manure; this increases readily available C and N for microbial processes creating little CH4 and increased N2O emissions following land application. Nitrous oxide emission occurs following land application as a byproduct of nitrification and dentrification processes in the soil, but these processes may also occur in compost, biofilter materials, and permeable storage covers. These microbial processes depend on temperature, moisture content, availability of easily degradable organic C, and oxidation status of the environment, which make N2O emissions and mitigation results highly variable. Managing the fate of ammoniacal N is essential to the success of N2O and CH4 mitigation because ammonia is an important component in the cycling of N through manure, soil, crops, and animal feeds. Manure application techniques such as subsurface injection reduce ammonia and CH4 emissions but can result in increased N2O emissions. Injection works well when combined with anaerobic digestion and solids separation by improving infiltration. Additives such as urease and nitrification inhibitors that inhibit microbial processes have mixed results but are generally effective in controlling N2O emission from intensive grazing systems. Matching plant nutrient requirements with manure fertilization, managing grazing intensity, and using cover crops are effective practices to increase plant N uptake and reduce N2O emissions. Due to system interactions, mitigation practices that reduce emissions in one stage of the manure management process may increase emissions elsewhere, so mitigation practices must be evaluated at the whole farm level.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "7090023760b52610c8f605ecc23bd704e55c8601", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2022407434", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2013.06.087", "CorpusId": 153702818}, "title": "A projection of energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the electricity sector for Saudi Arabia: The case for carbon capture and storage and solar photovoltaics", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "5b0830629495f855c2056e95c48a2b84a7231645", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2270306028", "DOI": "10.3197/096327115X14345368709907", "CorpusId": 147413091}, "title": "Meeting the Targets or Re-Imagining Society?

We consider investment timing and CCS operation flexibility and we also design a model for carbon price evolution with a carbon price floor using the Monte Carlo simulation method. We determine the floor prices above which immediate CCS investment is occuring, and those at which CO2 emissions can be eliminated. According to the simulation results, the carbon price floor has a significant effect on promoting CCS investment. The marginal effect of an increasing carbon price floor first rises and then falls; when the floor price reaches a threshold value, its marginal effect becomes minimal.

The high number of rings (up to 6), which act as multiple reactive sites and form a number of connections between the multi-dentate nodes, result in an extensive cross-linked framework. Condensation was obtained by two alternative synthetic routes, viz., Yamamoto cross-coupling and Friedel\u2013Crafts alkylation reactions. The structural characteristics and high stability of the porous polymers, even to mechanical compression, were carefully determined by several methods, including 1D and 2D solid state NMR, FT IR and thermal analyses. The CH4 uptake in the porous polymers allowed an understanding of the incremental response to pressure, up to extremely high values, and the exploitation of the extensive pressure range to customize the gas adsorption/desorption cycles for storage and transportation. Owing to the notable presence of large mesopores and network flexibility, combined with high surface area, a remarkable gain at high pressure was achieved, ensuring a highly competitive uptake/delivery efficiency. At 180 bar, adsorption values up to 445 cm3 STP g\u22121 were measured for porous organic polymers such as carbazolyl- and triptycene-based materials. The benchmark of these materials PAF1 reaches the value of 916 cm3 STP g\u22121 of adsorbed CH4, exceeding the performance of most of the best performing MOFs, COFs and activated carbons. CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms collected at room temperature enabled the assessment of the suitability of such polymer networks for CO2 selective separation and capture. In summary, the in-depth and extensive comparative screening within this class of materials up to high pressures provides the necessary parameters for further synthetic and applicative work.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "a3d01516788c568e0d2c77d13ac0745b27bd00ba", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2901003683", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2018.10.039", "CorpusId": 158442258}, "title": "Same or different?

We apply the mixed-integer model CCTS-Mod to compute a CCTS infrastructure network for Europe, examining the effects of different CO2 price paths with different regional foci. Scenarios assuming low CO2 certificate prices lead to hardly any CCTS development in Europe. The iron and steel sector starts deployment once the CO2 certificate prices exceed 50 \u20ac/tCO2. The cement sector starts investing at a threshold of 75 \u20ac/tCO2, followed by the electricity sector when prices exceed 100 \u20ac/tCO2. The degree of CCTS deployment is found to be more sensitive to variable costs of CO2 capture than to investment costs. Additional revenues generated from utilizing CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) in the North Sea would lead to an earlier adoption of CCTS, independent of the CO2 certificate price; this case may become especially relevant for the UK, Norway and the Netherlands.

In this paper we begin to map out some of the key issues associated with CCS, using a multi-criteria approach to explore how an (admittedly small) selection of stakeholders perceive alternative storage options and energy scenarios. We present five long-term scenarios describing alternative ways in which the UK energy system could develop and which deploy different levels of carbon storage.

According to the results, grid integration on a larger scale decreases the total system cost and levelized cost of electricity by reducing the need for storage technologies due to seasonal variations in weather and demand profiles.

A critical element for the commercialisation of CCS is the construction and operation of up to 12 coal-fired CCS demonstration plants. The cost of this demonstration programme has been estimated to be between 8.5 and 13 billion Euros. This cost has been estimated assuming the size and composition of the fleet of the CCS demonstration plants and by calculating, based on a cash flow analysis, their additional discounted lifetime costs. The calculations presented in this report show that the additional costs for a 400 MW plant range between 680 million Euros for coal-plants and 550 Euros for gas plants. Assuming a CO2 price as in the scenarios developed for the second European Strategic Energy Review, the additional revenue required for making these demonstration plants competitive in the electricity market are 46 Euros for coal plants and 77 Euros for gas plants per tonne of CO2 avoided. These calculations are very sensitive to the assumptions made with regards to the capital costs, the costs of CO2 transport and storage, fuel and CO2 prices and the discount rate. These additional costs have been estimated using reference values for the cost of the CO2 capture technologies (preand post-combustion and oxyfuel), which have stemmed from an extensive assessment of literature sources using a transparent methodology, which alleviates to a significant extent the confusion about the economics of CCS technologies.

Questa tecnica permette l\u2019uso di combustibili fossili con emissioni di CO 2 signi cativamente pi\u00f9 basse. Per questo motivo CCS pu\u00f2 essere visto come un\u2019opzione di mitigazione importante nella transizione globale verso un\u2019economia sostenibile low-carbon, sia nel settore della produzione di energia che nell\u2019industria [3][4]. La \u201ccatena\u201d CCS si compone di tre fasi: cattura, trasporto e stoccaggio. Ogni stadio del CCS \u00e8 tecnicamente disponibile e utilizzato in di erenti settori commerciali da anni [2][5]. Tuttavia l\u2019applicazione congiunta di queste tecnologie a sorgenti di emissione di CO 2 \u00e8 ancora troppo penalizzante in termini energetici ed economici, limitandone quindi l\u2019applicazione su vasta scala [2]. Ad oggi diverse tecnologie, con diversi gradi di maturit\u00e0, sono in competizione per essere la soluzione a pi\u00f9 basso costo per ogni fase all\u2019interno della catena CCS, cos\u00ec da rendere l\u2019intero processo applicabile su vasta scala. Le tecnologie CCS sono presenti nel Blue Map Scenario 2050 realizzato dall\u2019Agenzia Internazionale per l\u2019Energia (AIE), dove sono riportati i possibili contributi delle diverse strategie di mitigazione per contenere il riscaldamento globale ben al di sotto dei 2\u00b0C in pi\u00f9 rispetto alla temperatura media del periodo preindustriale (Figura 1) [6]. Come evidenziato dalla Technology Roadmap on CCS della AIE, CCS dovrebbe contribuire per il quasi 20% alla riduzione delle emissioni di CO 2 in atmosfera, andando a catturarne no a 10 Gt all\u2019anno (stima per il 2050). Il numero di impianti dovr\u00e0 quindi passare dai 15 odierni a circa 100 nel 2020 no a quasi 3500 nel 2050 [7]. Recentemente, un\u2019alternativa correlata a CCS, ovvero il Carbon Capture and Utilization (CCU), ha iniziato a attirare l\u2019attenzione mondiale perch\u00e9 in grado di trasformare le emissioni di CO 2 di scarico in prodotti di valore. CCU combina la cattura di CO 2 col suo riutilizzo sia come uido tecnologico che come reagente per la produzione di sostanze chimiche, plastiche o combustibili. Il vantaggio principale di questa tecnologia \u00e8 quello di ottenere alla ne un prodotto di valore commerciale in grado di bilanciare i costi necessari per la cattura di CO 2 [8]. L\u2019applicazione pi\u00f9 rilevante per la produzione di combustibili e chemicals \u00e8 certamente la sintesi dei combustibili direttamente utilizzabili, come la produzione di metano mediante riduzione della CO 2 con H 2 prodotto dall\u2019acqua mediante elettrolisi alimentata da fonte rinnovabile o da esuberi energetici della rete.

La produzione di SNG da carbone presenta il vantaggio di ottenere un gas immediatamente collocabile sul mercato della distribuzione verso gli usi nali, senza richiedere ulteriori sezioni di ra nazione, con particolare ricaduta di un impiego massiccio di carboni di basso rango, di scarso valore commerciale. 2 nello scenario Blue Map", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "ad4dc196a6d0370554e7912665ca5bbf15e1c7a0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1947806665", "DOI": "10.1002/9781118991978.HCES061", "CorpusId": 108860776}, "title": "Pre\u2010Combustion Carbon Capture", "abstract": "Pre-combustion carbon capture based on integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology represents one approach to fossil fueled power generation with carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the short run. It is based on the generation of a syngas often from coal followed by a complex syngas treatment before combustion in a combined cycle power block. Because of the gas treatment and the higher combined cycle efficiency, IGCC power plants are regarded as highly efficient and low emission power plants. If designed for CCS, CO2 will be separated from the fuel gas before combustion in the gas turbine. The CO2 is captured at advantageous conditions with liquid solvents and obtained at a high quality. All major process units forming an IGCC power plant are well demonstrated in the electricity generation sector or the chemical industry. However, IGCC plants feature higher complexity and significantly higher capital investment than conventional power plants. Despite some demonstration plants, the technology has not reached full maturity or availabilities as they are achieved by competing coal power plants. Consequently, it is still yielding high costs of electricity. A new approach to overcome economic drawbacks and with the potential to integrate renewable with fossil power generation is given by polygeneration concepts. It often relies on the combination of IGCC with coal-to-liquids routes allowing for the coproduction of electricity and synthesis products. Polygeneration allows for a significant reduction of CO2 emissions by integrating renewable energy sources.

Equipping power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has the potential to reduce current worldwide CO2 emissions. However, existing CCS schemes (i.e., amine scrubbing) are highly energy-intensive. The urgent abatement of CO2 emissions relies on the development of new, efficient technologies to capture CO2 from existing power plants. Membrane-based CO2 separation is an attractive technology that meets many of the requirements for energy-efficient industrial carbon capture. Within this domain, thin-film composite (TFC) membranes are particularly attractive, providing high gas permeance in comparison with conventional thicker (\u223c50 \u03bcm) dense membranes. TFC membranes are usually composed of three layers: (1) a bottom porous support layer; (2) a highly permeable intermediate gutter layer; and (3) a thin (<1 \u03bcm) species-selective top layer. A key challenge in the development of TFC membranes has been to simultaneously maximize the transmembrane gas permeance of the assembled membrane (by minimizing the gas resistance of each layer) while maintaining high gas-specific selectivity. In this Account, we provide an overview of our recent development of high-performance TFC membrane materials as well as insights into the unique fabrication strategies employed for the selective layer and gutter layer. Optimization of each layer of the membrane assembly individually results in significant improvements in overall membrane performance. First, incorporating nanosized fillers into the selective layer (poly(ethylene glycol)-based polymers) and reducing its thickness (to ca. 50 nm) through continuous assembly of polymers technology yields\u00a0major improvements in CO2 permeance without loss of selectivity. Second, we focus on optimization of the middle gutter layer of TFC membranes. The development of enhanced gutter layers employing two- and three-dimensional metal-organic framework materials leads to considerable improvements in both CO2 permeance and selectivity compared with traditional poly(dimethylsiloxane) materials. Third, incorporation of a porous, flexible support layer culminates in a mechanically robust high-performance TFC membrane design that exhibits unprecedented CO2 separation performance and holds significant potential for industrial CO2 capture. Alternative strategies are also emerging, whereby the selective layer and gutter layer may be combined for enhanced membrane efficiency.

Quantifying carbon storage in coastal wetland environments is important for identifying areas of high carbon sequestration value that could be targeted for conservation. This study combines remote sensing and sediment analysis to identify spatial variation in soil carbon storage for Currambene Creek, New South Wales, Australia to establish whether vegetation structure influences soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm. Wetland vegetation was delineated to capture structural complexity within vegetation communities using Light detection and ranging (Lidar) point cloud data and aerial imagery with an object-based image analysis approach. Sediment cores were collected and analysed for soil carbon content to quantify below-ground carbon storage across the site. The total soil carbon storage in the upper 30 cm for the wetland (59.6 ha) was estimated to be 3933 \u00b1 444 Mg C. Tall mangrove were found to have the highest total carbon storage (1420 \u00b1 198 Mg C), however are particularly sensitive to changes in sea-level as they are positioned lowest in the intertidal frame. Conservation efforts targeted at protecting areas of high carbon sequestration, such as the tall mangrove, will lead to a greater contribution to carbon mitigation efforts.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "2aa109b9244e1cb674a54855bdfbdbcf28576809", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2034809068", "DOI": "10.1115/1.4001988", "CorpusId": 110301455}, "title": "A Novel Approach of Retrofitting a Combined Cycle With Post Combustion CO2 Capture", "abstract": "Most state-of-the-art natural gas-fired combined cycle (NGCC) plants are triple-pressure reheat cycles with efficiencies close to 60%. However, with carbon capture and storage, the efficiency will be penalized by almost 10% units. To limit the energy consumption for a carbon capture NGCC plant, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is necessary. Utilizing EGR increases the CO2 content in the gas turbine exhaust while it reduces the flue gas flow to be treated in the capture plant. Nevertheless, due to EGR, the gas turbine will experience a different media with different properties compared with the design case. This study looks into how the turbomachinery reacts to EGR. The work also discusses the potential of further improvements by utilizing pressurized water rather than extraction steam as the heat source for the CO2 stripper. The results show that the required low-pressure level should be elevated to a point close to the intermediate-pressure to achieve optimum efficiency, hence, one pressure level can be omitted. The main tool used for this study is an in-house off-design model based on fully dimensionless groups programmed in the commercially available heat and mass balance program IPSEPRO. The model is based on a GE 109FB machine with a triple-pressure reheat steam cycle.

In view of a limited future supply of biomass, this article outlines the options to further develop carbon recycling (C-REC). The focus is on carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture and use for synthesis of platform chemicals to produce polymers. CO 2 may be captured from exhaust gases after combustion or fermentation of waste in order to establish a C-REC system within the technosphere. As a long-term option, an external C-REC system can be developed by capturing atmospheric CO 2 . A central role may be expected from renewable methane (or synthetic natural gas), which is increasingly being used for storage and transport of energy, but may also be used for renewable carbon supply for chemistry. The energy input for the C-REC processes can come from wind and solar systems, in particular, power for the production of hydrogen, which is combined with CO 2 to produce various hydrocarbons. Most of the technological components for the system already exist, and, first modules for renewable fuel and polymer production systems are underway in Germany. This article outlines how the system may further develop over the medium to long term, from a piggy-back add-on flow system toward a self-carrying recycling system, which has the potential to provide the material and energy backbone of future societies.

Growth rate analysis, constrained by historic commercial CO2 storage rates, indicates sufficient growth to achieve several of the 2100 storage targets identified in the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.

However, detailed studies on how CO2\u2010enriched (acidic) brine changes this pore structure at relevant reservoir storage conditions are very limited. Thus, to provide further quantitative information and more fundamental understanding about these key processes, we studied the dissolution patterns of a homogeneous, a fractured, and a vuggy limestone when flooded with CO2\u2010saturated brine at representative storage conditions. The pore structured of these limestones showed drastically different responses to the acidic brine flood. As such, preferential channels surrounded by branched channels were formed in the homogeneous sample, while fractures became the main flow path in the fractured sample. In contrast, only one dominant channel formed in the vuggy sample, which resulted in a sharp permeability increase. These dissolution patterns reflect the associated Damk\u00f6hler number, which significantly lower in the homogeneous, representing uniform dissolution. However, after injecting sufficient reactive fluid (1,000 PV), this uniform dissolution pattern transformed into a single preferential channel growth. Moreover, we conclude that increasing complexity of the pore geometry leads to more nonuniform dissolution. These dissolution patterns indicate the effect of initial pore structure on preferential channel growth and reaction transport.

However, there are challenges for widespread implementation including the need to develop mineralization process routes for permanent carbon storage. Mineral carbonation of highly reactive feedstocks may be limited by the supply rate of CO2. This rate limitation can be directly addressed by incorporating enzyme-catalyzed CO2 hydration. This study examined the effects of bovine carbonic anhydrase (BCA) and CO2-rich gas streams on the carbonation rate of brucite [Mg(OH)2], a highly reactive mineral. Alkaline brucite slurries were amended with BCA and supplied with 10% CO2 gas while aqueous chemistry and solids were monitored throughout the experiments (hours to days). In comparison to controls, brucite carbonation using BCA was accelerated by up to 240%.

In this respect, post-combustion systems have received great attention as a possible near-term CO2 capture technology that can be retrofitted to existing power plants. This capture technology is, however, energy-intensive and results in large equipment sizes because of the large volumes of the flue gas to be treated. To cope with the demerits of other CCS technologies, the chemical looping combustion (CLC) process has been recently considered as a solution for CO2 separation. It is typically referred to as a technology without energy penalty. Indeed, in CLC the fuel and the combustion air are never mixed and the gases from the oxidation of the fuel (i.e., CO2 and H2O) leave the system as a separate stream and can be separated by condensation of H2O without any loss of energy. The key issue for the CLC process is to find a suitable oxygen carrier, which provides the fuel with the activated oxygen needed for combustion. The aim of this work is to explore the feasibility of using perovskites as oxygen carriers in CLC and to consider the possible advantages with respect to the scrubbing process with amines, a mature post-combustion technology for CO2 separation.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "62872ce855c9b37182eb72cd1576d985fd785f3f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2006629316", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1311316110", "CorpusId": 22959187, "PubMed": "24191019"}, "title": "Gas injection may have triggered earthquakes in the Cogdell oil field, Texas", "abstract": "Significance Between 2006 and 2011 a series of earthquakes occurred in the Cogdell oil field near Snyder, TX. A previous series of earthquakes occurring 1975\u20131982 was attributed to the injection of water into wells to enhance oil production. We evaluated injection and extraction of oil, water, and gas in the Cogdell field. Water injection cannot explain the 2006\u20132011 earthquakes. However, since 2004 significant volumes of gas including CO2 have been injected into Cogdell wells. If this triggered the 2006\u20132011 seismicity, this represents an instance where gas injection has triggered earthquakes having magnitudes 3 and larger. Understanding when gas injection triggers earthquakes will help evaluate risks associated with large-scale carbon capture and storage as a strategy for managing climate change. Between 1957 and 1982, water flooding was conducted to improve petroleum production in the Cogdell oil field north of Snyder, TX, and a contemporary analysis concluded this induced earthquakes that occurred between 1975 and 1982. The National Earthquake Information Center detected no further activity between 1983 and 2005, but between 2006 and 2011 reported 18 earthquakes having magnitudes 3 and greater. To investigate these earthquakes, we analyzed data recorded by six temporary seismograph stations deployed by the USArray program, and identified 93 well-recorded earthquakes occurring between March 2009 and December 2010. Relocation with a double-difference method shows that most earthquakes occurred within several northeast\u2013southwest-trending linear clusters, with trends corresponding to nodal planes of regional focal mechanisms, possibly indicating the presence of previously unidentified faults. We have evaluated data concerning injection and extraction of oil, water, and gas in the Cogdell field. Water injection cannot explain the 2006\u20132011 earthquakes, especially as net volumes (injection minus extraction) are significantly less than in the 1957\u20131982 period. However, since 2004 significant volumes of gases including supercritical CO2 have been injected into the Cogdell field. The timing of gas injection suggests it may have contributed to triggering the recent seismic activity.

By deliberately integrating trees with crop-and animal-production systems, agroforestry systems offer a promising avenue for C storage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in several of the managed terrestrial ecosystems around the world. Exploitation of mechanisms such as nutrient cycling, nitrogen fixation by tree legumes, and deep-capture of nutrients by deep-rooted tree components offers a distinct possibility for reducing agrochemical inputs to these systems, yet maintaining the system productivity at reasonable levels on a sustained basis. Furthermore, with the emphasis on fruit trees and other multipurpose trees that provide multiple products and services, the proportion of total photosynthates that is removed from the system is minimized, thereby facilitating storage of more C in the system than in conventional, clear-cut silvicultural systems. Examples of management opportunities in agroforestry for better C sequestration include adoption of \u201cgreen\u201d technologies such as return of biomass and plant residues to fields, providing vegetative barriers and canopy cover on soil surface to reduce soil erosion, and reclaiming degraded lands such as salt-affected and eroded soils through tree planting. The extent of and possibility for agroforestry vary in different parts of the world. Alley cropping and improved fallow systems are good examples of intensive biomassmanagement systems in the tropics, whereas shaded perennial and silvopastoral systems represent situations with permanent tree cover. The five recognized agroforestry systems in the temperate region-alley cropping, forest farming, riparian buffer, silvopasture, and windbreaks-vary greatly in their C storage potential. Although trees are good C sinks, the relationship between tree planting and C sequestration is not a simple one. Estimates of C sequestration from terrestrial ecosystems are based on models extrapolated from experimental data, monitoring of changes in atmospheric CO2, and remote sensing using satellite imagery to detect changes in land-use practices. Each of these methods has drawbacks. The situation is more complex in the case of agroforestry systems, on which neither reliable statistics on the extent of area, nor rigorous C sequestration data under filed conditions exist. Furthermore, while theoretical or experimental data are useful for predicting effects of agroforestry in C sequestration, economic realities are a major factor in determining actual as opposed to potential amounts stored. Thus, although agroforestry systems seem to have high potential for C sequestration, considerable effort is needed in realistically assessing the magnitude of this potential as well as realizing it.
