We designed a mature form of ASCA (mASCA) using a codon optimization of ASCA gene and removal of ASCA signal peptide. mASCA was highly expressed (255\u00a0mg/L) with a molecular weight of approximately 26\u00a0kDa. The mASCA enzyme exhibited stable esterase activity within a temperature range of 10\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C and a pH range of 6\u201311. mASCA activity remained stable for 48\u00a0h at pH 10. We also investigated its inhibition profiles using inorganic anions, such as acetazolamide, sulfanilamide, iodide, nitrate, and azide. We also demonstrate that mASCA is capable of catalyzing the conversion of CO2 to CaCO3 (calcite form) in the presence of Ca2+.

By integrating important parameters for CCS technologies into a carbon-abatement model similar to the EPRI Prism analysis (EPRI, 2007), this study concludes that the start time and rate of technology diffusion are important in determining emissions reductions and fuel consumption for CCS technologies. Comparisons with legislative emissions targets illustrate that CCS alone is very unlikely to meet reduction targets for the electric-power sector, even under aggressive deployment scenarios. A portfolio of supply and demand-side strategies is needed to reach emissions objectives, especially in the near term. Furthermore, model results show that the breakdown of capture technologies does not have a significant influence on potential emissions reductions.

Here we provide a micro- and nanostructural characterization of the olivine/water interface during the carbonation of forsteritic olivine at 150 \u00b0C and pCO\u2082 = 100 bar. When the reaction starts under oxic conditions, the observed temporal sequence of interfacial layers consists of: a hematite/SiO2(am) assemblage, Fe-rich phyllosilicates with mixed Fe valence and a non-passivating Fe-free amorphous SiO2 layer, which allows the formation of ferroan magnesite. In contrast, starting at micro-oxic conditions, carbonation rates are much faster, with no real evidence of interfacial layers. Separate deposits of goethite/lepidocrocite in the early stages of the reaction and then formation of magnetite are observed at these conditions, while precipitation of siderite/magnesite proceeds unhindered. The evolution of the redox conditions during the reaction progress controls the sequence of the observed reaction products and the passivating properties of Fe-Si-rich interfacial layers.

In this study, we have proposed CO2 capture and storage via hydrate in geological formation within the hydrate stability zone as a novel technique to contribute to global warming mitigation strategies, including carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and to prevent vast methane release into the atmosphere caused by hydrate melting. We have attempted to enhance total gas uptake and CO2 capture efficiency in hydrate in the presence of kinetic promoters while using diluted CO2 gas (CO2-N2 mixture). Experiments are performed using unfrozen sands within hydrate stability zone condition and in the presence of low dosage surfactant and amino acids. Hydrate formation parameters, including sub-cooling temperature, induction time, total gas uptake, and split fraction, are calculated during the single-step formation and dissociation process. The effect of sands with varying particle sizes (160\u2013630 \u00b5m, 1400\u20135000 \u00b5m), low dosage promoter (500\u20133000 ppm) and CO2 concentration in feed gas (20\u201330 mol%) on formation kinetic parameters was investigated. Enhanced formation kinetics are observed in the presence of surfactant (1000\u20133000 ppm) and hydrophobic amino acids (3000 ppm) at 120 bar and 1 \u2103 experimental conditions. We report induction time in the range of 7\u2013170 min and CO2 split fraction (0.60\u20130.90) in hydrate for 120 bar initial injection pressure. CO2 split fraction can be enhanced by reducing sand particle size or increasing the CO2 mol% in incoming feed gas at given injection pressure. This study also reports that formation kinetics in a porous medium are influenced by hydrate morphology. Hydrate morphology influences gas and water migration within sediments and controls pore space or particle surface correlation with the formation kinetics within coarse sediments. This investigation demonstrates the potential application of bio-friendly amino acids as promoters to enhance CO2 capture and storage within hydrate. Sufficient contact time at gas-liquid interface and higher CO2 separation efficiency is recorded in the presence of amino acids.

CO2 pipelines have been in operation in USA, Europe and North Africa since the 1980\u201fs; however anthropogenic carbon dioxide transport by pipeline brings with it new challenges due to the effects of different impurities coming from flue gases.

Replacement of fossil fuels for other energy sources and measures to reduce the primary energy demand are important paths of achieving this goal. A third path, which is beginning to receive recognition, is the capture and storage of the carbon dioxide formed from the combustion or conversion of fossil fuels. The purpose of this symposium is to give an overview of the status of the technology for capture and storage, and to highlight related work carried out in the Nordic countries. Below an introduction to the CO2 problem and to the status of CO2 sequestration is given. The CO2 problem The latest IPCC evaluation concludes that the temperature increase during the last century was 0.6\u00b10.2oC (IPCC, 2001), and that it is \"likely that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the 1990s was the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year\" during the last 1000 years.

Although it would be difficult to prove, it is very likely that the noted temperature increase has been caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, of which CO2 released from fossil fuel combustion is the primary one. Today the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is about 370 ppm, which is 30% higher than the pre-industrial level of 280 ppm. The stabilisation of the CO2 level at twice the pre-industrial level, or 550 ppm, is estimated to require a gradual reduction of the average CO2 emissions per capita by a factor of two before the year 2100, see Fig. 2. The corresponding reduction in Europe would have to be much greater because of the higher emissions per capita, about 10 ton/year. Even with such measures the climate is expected to be dramatically affected, with an estimated average temperature rise of 1.5-4.5 degrees. These numbers are put in perspective by a comparison: the average world temperature during the last ice age was approximately 4 degrees lower than today.

This study performs a streamlined life cycle assessment (LCA) of a coal-fired plant in South Africa. The cradle-to-grave LCA focuses on the coal cycle to determine hotspots with high environmental impacts in the process. Four impact categories were considered in this study: global warming potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, eutrophication potential, and acidification potential. Coal transportation, coal pulverization, water use, and ash management were identified as hotspots in the coal cycle. The coal process has 95% potential for global warming, 4% potential for eutrophication, 1% potential for acidification, and a negligible percentage for photochemical ozone creation. Susceptibility to climate change, eutrophication, acid rain, soil degradation, and water contamination among others are major concerns of the coal cycle. Outsourcing coal from nearby mines with train as medium of transportation reduces environmental impact.

The appropriate construction time of a CCS unit is evaluated by binominal decision tree analysis for option exercise. We calculate the change of project ROV and the appropriate construction time according to the difference in carbon emission benchmarks and the variation of the maintenance cost of COAL. The effect of power station lifetime is also analyzed. We conclude that flexibility in the timing of decision making increases the value of a project.

While an extreme perspective is to envision CCS as a magic bullet to solve the issue of climate change, a more balanced economics perspective would situate this approach within a portfolio of mitigation actions. CCS can be implemented with two purposes: it can act as a substitute for other technological efforts to reach a given environmental target and it offers the potential for additional emission reductions to reach a 'safer' climate target. In order to balance these two possible ways of utilizing CCS and to assess their respective effects on early policy strategies, we have undertaken a two fold numerical experiment. First, a cost-efficiency analysis was undertaken, where the sole effect of CCS was substitution for other efforts. This was followed by a cost-benefit analysis where both purposes had to be balanced. We find that future availability of CCS is less of a reason to relax near-term abatement efforts than what could be inferred from previous analyses.

In this study we examined the combined role of herbivores and climate warming as drivers of CO2 fluxes in two typical high-latitude habitats (mesic heath and wet meadow). We hypothesized that both herbivory and climate warming would reduce the C sink strength of Arctic tundra through their combined effects on plant biomass and gross ecosystem photosynthesis and on decomposition rates and the abiotic environment. To test this hypothesis we employed experimental warming (via International Tundra Experiment [ITEX] chambers) and grazing (via captive Barnacle Geese) in a three-year factorial field experiment. Ecosystem CO2 fluxes (net ecosystem exchange of CO2, ecosystem respiration, and gross ecosystem photosynthesis) were measured in all treatments at varying intensity over the three growing seasons to capture the impact of the treatments on a range of temporal scales (diurnal, seasonal, and interannual). Grazing and warming treatments had markedly different effects on CO2 fluxes in the two tundra habitats. Grazing caused a strong reduction in CO2 assimilation in the wet meadow, while warming reduced CO2 efflux from the mesic heath. Treatment effects on net ecosystem exchange largely derived from the modification of gross ecosystem photosynthesis rather than ecosystem respiration. In this study we have demonstrated that on the habitat scale, grazing by geese is a strong driver of net ecosystem exchange of CO2, with the potential to reduce the CO2 sink strength of Arctic ecosystems. Our results highlight that the large reduction in plant biomass due to goose grazing in the Arctic noted in several studies can alter the C balance of wet tundra ecosystems.

However, there have been a few issues raised in recent years, indicating the potential leakages paths created during and after injection. One of the major issues might be the chemical interaction of supercritical CO2 with the cement, which may lead to the partial or total loss of the cement sheath. There have been many approaches presented to improve the physical and mechanical properties of the cement against CO2 attack such as changing the water-to-cement ratio, employing pozzolanic materials, and considering non-Portland cements.

It has many of the advantages of conventional gasification with respect to flexibility in commercial use, but has a potentially lower cost and a superior environmental profile. UCG could increase coal resources available for utilization enormously by gasifying otherwise unmineable deep or thin coal seams. UCG may have a cost advantage over other coal conversion technologies. This advantage may be particularly relevant to the area of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). As a result, UCG may not only provide an important avenue for low carbon use of coal in the U.S., but also eventually in rapidly developing economies. UCG technology was first developed in the former Soviet Union (FSU) in the 1920s. The U.S. and Europe also conducted several tests in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1990s, China began UCG research and development and is continuing with this effort. UCG is currently experiencing a resurgence with the development of a handful of initial commercial start ups in the last decade, as well as some successful pilot projects. However, a significant research and development effort is needed to fully commercialize the technology and make it available for wide-scale use. History Between 1974 and 1989, the U.S. was the site of major research and deployment efforts in UCG. This was largely driven by the OPEC oil embargos and increasing oil prices, and ended effectively with the 1986 drop in oil prices. During this time, there were 33 UCG pilots in Wyoming, Texas, Alabama, West Virginia, and Washington. These plants were laboratories for major technology developments and validation of cavity growth and gasification models. The Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored much of this research, and Lawrence Livermore National Lab was a major participant, managing 50% of the pilot plants. The FSU was the first nation to initiate a national program of UCG research and development, in 1928. Underground experiments had begun by 1933 in parallel with the experimental and theoretical programs. Commercial-scale production of syngas was achieved at numerous locations and for long periods of time, most notably at Angren, Uzbekistan. The Angren mine began production in 1959 and still has UCG technology in place to produce 18 billion cubic feet of gas for the Angren power station. \u2026", "year": 1974}, {"paperId": "5e47f7828da0fb432ac513be7710d7b7aa9abf3e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2539955385", "DOI": "10.1016/j.marenvres.2016.10.007", "CorpusId": 36148045, "PubMed": "27816195"}, "title": "CO2 leakage from carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) systems affects organic matter cycling in surface marine sediments.", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "1e13c57e142dbf0979b013e79eeb9d833ece4315", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2131732563", "DOI": "10.1111/gcb.12537", "CorpusId": 232571, "PubMed": "24464936"}, "title": "An improved approach for remotely sensing water stress impacts on forest C uptake", "abstract": "Given that forests represent the primary terrestrial sink for atmospheric CO2, projections of future carbon (C) storage hinge on forest responses to climate variation.

First, we paired two independent drought indices with NDVI data for the conterminous US from 2000 to 2011, and examined the relationship between water stress and NDVI.

The assessment of the risks related to CO2 storage is an important task. Events such as CO2 leakage and brine displacement could result in hazards for human health and the environment. \n \nIn this thesis, a systematic and comprehensive risk assessment concept is presented to investigate various levels of uncertainties and to assess risks using numerical simulations. Depending on the risk and the processes, which should be assessed, very complex models, large model domains, large time scales, and many simulations runs for estimating probabilities are required. To reduce the resulting high computational costs, a model reduction technique (the arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion) and a method for model coupling in space are applied. The different levels of uncertainties are: statistical uncertainty in parameter distributions, scenario uncertainty, e.g. different geological features, and recognized ignorance due to assumptions in the conceptual model set-up. Recognized ignorance and scenario uncertainty are investigated by simulating well defined model set-ups and scenarios. According to damage values, which are defined as a model output, the set-ups and scenarios can be compared and ranked. For statistical uncertainty probabilities can be determined by running Monte Carlo simulations with the reduced model. The results are presented in various ways: e.g., mean damage, probability density function, cumulative distribution function, or an overall risk value by multiplying the damage with the probability. If the model output (damage) cannot be compared to provided criteria (e.g. water quality criteria), analytical approximations are presented to translate the damage into comparable values. The overall concept is applied for the risks related to brine displacement and infiltration into drinking water aquifers. The uncertainties on all three levels are investigated in three approaches with different focus. The concept can also be applied to CO2 leakage or hazards related to other technologies in the subsurface such as methane storage or atomic waste disposal. \n \nIn the second part of this thesis, uncertainty studies for two realistic storage formations (the pilot site Ketzin (Germany) and a realistic storage formation in the North German Basin) are performed to investigate the related uncertainties and to reduce them as much as possible. For the Ketzin site, history matching of the measurement data, is an important task for dynamic modeling and essential for future risk assessment. A systematic approach to fit the data set using inverse modeling is presented in this work. For future risk assessment for realistic sites, e.g. for the Ketzin site, the uncertainty studies and the history matching approach provide important information. \n \nFinally, CCS is discussed in the context of risk perception and the possible input of the risk assessment concept presented in this work is discussed. \nThis work is a first attempt to connect the technical risk assessment for CO2 storage to the social science approach for risk assessment. It is bridging the gap between engineering and social sciences by integrating the technical quantification of risk into the wider context of a comprehensive risk governance model. \nCarbon Capture and Storage (CCS) ist eine mogliche Option den anthropogenen Treibhauseffekt durch Reduzierung der CO2 Emissionen in die Atmosphare abzuschwachen. Eine wichtige Aufgabe ist es die Risiken, die wahrend der Lagerung des CO2 in geologischen Formationen auftreten konnten, zu untersuchen. Ereignisse, die zu mogliche Gefahrdungen fuhren konnen, sind der Austritt von CO2 aus dem Reservoir oder die Verdrangung des im Reservoir vorhandenen Salzwassers. \n \nIn dieser Arbeit wird ein systematisches und verstandliches Konzept entwickelt, um verschiedene Stufen von Unsicherheiten zu untersuchen und Risiken abzuschatzen. Hierfur werden unterschiedliche numerische Modelle und Methoden verwendet. Um die enormen Rechenzeiten, die durch die Komplexitat der Modelle und den Bedarf von unzahligen Variationsrechnungen gegeben ist, zu reduzieren, werden Methoden der Modellkopplung im Raum und der Modellreduktion (\u201cArbitrary Polynomial Chaos Expansion\u201d) angewendet. \nDas Risikokonzept unterteilt die Unsicherheiten in unterschiedlicher Stufen: Statistische Unsicherheiten in Parameterverteilungen, Szenariounsicherheit, zum Beispiel unterschiedliche geologische Strukturen und \u201crecognized ignorance\u201d (bewusstes Ausschliesen von Prozessen). Recognized ignorance und Szenariounsicherheit werden durch Simulationen von unterschiedlichen, eindeutig definierten Modellkonzepten und Szenarien untersucht. Die unterschiedlichen Modellkonzepte und Szenarien konnen dann anhand des Schadens, welcher als Modellausgabe der Simulation definiert wird, bewertet, verglichen und klassifiziert werden. Fur statistische Unsicherheiten konnen neben dem Schaden auch Wahrscheinlichkeiten bestimmt werden. Hierfur werden zahlreiche Monte Carlo Simulationen mit dem reduzierten Modell durchgefuhrt. Die Ergebnisse konnen auf verschiedene Arten dargestellt werden: Z.B. als Mittelwerte des Schadens, als Wahrscheinlichkeitsdichtefunktion, als kumulative Verteilungsfunktion, oder als ubergreifender Risikowert durch Multiplikation des Schadens mit der Wahrscheinlichkeit. Analytische Abschatzungen konnen zusatzlich verwendet werden um den Schaden, der als Modellausgabe definiert ist, in Werte zu ubertragen, die mit Richtwerten (z.B. Trinkwasserkriterien) verglichen werden konnen. \nDas Konzept zur Risikoabschatzung wird in dieser Arbeit auf die Untersuchung von Risiken, die mit der Salzwasserverdrangung verbunden sind, angewendet. Das Konzept kann auch auf andere Gefahrdungen angewendet werden, wie zum Beispiel CO2 Lekagen oder Gefahrdungen bei anderen Technologien im Untergrund wie z.B. Methanspeicherung oder Atommullendlagerung. \n \nIm zweiten Teil der Arbeit werden unterschiedliche Unsicherheitsanalysen fur realistische Speicherformationen (fur das Pilot Projekt Ketzin und fur eine realistische Speicherformation im Norddeutschen Becken) durchgefuhrt. Eine wichtige Aufgabe fur die dynamische Modellierung im Zusammenhang mit der Speicherstatte Ketzin ist das \u201cHistory matching\u201d von Messdaten (Modellvalidierung anhand von Messdaten).

This includes a range of approaches including soil carbon sequestration (e.g., through no-till farming), terrestrial biomass sequestration (e.g., through planting forests), direct ocean injection of CO{sub 2} either onto the deep seafloor or into the intermediate depths, injection into deep geological formations, or even direct conversion of CO{sub 2} to carbonate minerals. Some of these approaches are considered geoengineering (see the appropriate chapter herein). All are considered in the 2005 special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 2005). Of the range of options available, geological carbon sequestration (GCS) appears to be the most actionable and economic option for major greenhouse gas reduction in the next 10-30 years. The basis for this interest includes several factors: (1) The potential capacities are large based on initial estimates. Formal estimates for global storage potential vary substantially, but are likely to be between 800 and 3300 Gt of C (3000 and 10,000 Gt of CO{sub 2}), with significant capacity located reasonably near large point sources of the CO{sub 2}. (2) GCS can begin operations with demonstrated technology. Carbon dioxide has been separated from large point sources for nearly 100 years, and has been injected underground for over 30 years (below). (3) Testing of GCS at intermediate scale is feasible. In the US, Canada, and many industrial countries, large CO{sub 2} sources like power plants and refineries lie near prospective storage sites. These plants could be retrofit today and injection begun (while bearing in mind scientific uncertainties and unknowns). Indeed, some have, and three projects described here provide a great deal of information on the operational needs and field implementation of CCS. Part of this interest comes from several key documents written in the last three years that provide information on the status, economics, technology, and impact of CCS. These are cited throughout this text and identified as key references at the end of this manuscript. When coupled with improvements in energy efficiency, renewable energy supplies, and nuclear power, CCS help dramatically reduce current and future emissions (US CCTP 2005, MIT 2007). If CCS is not available as a carbon management option, it will be much more difficult and much more expensive to stabilize atmospheric CO{sub 2} emissions. Recent estimates put the cost of carbon abatement without CCS to be 30-80% higher that if CCS were to be available (Edmonds et al. 2004).", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "a8c3ce34e6f52ef5c4b59d5d5a9399c934d5e0e7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2792326049", "DOI": "10.17794/RGN.2018.2.1", "CorpusId": 155757905}, "title": "CCS TECHNOLOGY: OVERVIEW OF PROJECTS, TECHNOLOGY AND MONITORING", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) in terms of geological sequestration presents the process of capturing CO2 from large point sources, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it into an underground geological formation.In addition to ecological benefits, underground injection of CO2 shows certain potential risks associated with unwanted migration of CO2 to groundwater and surface, so the possibility of carrying out such projects depends on the possibility of reducing mentioned risks to an acceptable level.

New insights into the characteristics and interdependencies of environmental problems are constantly generated and technological and scientific progress continuously broaden the portfolio of response measures. The particular challenge for the international lawyer and policy-maker is to design flexible legal instruments which are able to adequately respond to and account for the continuous technological and scientific advancement. The demand for high flexibility has led to the evolvement of manifold flexibility mechanisms in environmental treaty regimes. This is often met through informal and formal regulatory activity within regimes and organizations that is akin to that of domestic administrations. In the case at hand, the environmental problem of climate change is now well known, but its implications are not yet entirely understood. In particular the interdependencies of the issue with other areas of environmental protection such as the protection of biodiversity or the protection of marine living resources are now surfacing. The protection sought requires regulatory responses which transcend traditional boundaries of environmental regimes. As will be seen, this leads to the situation that the issue of climate change, in this case due to the ocean acidification deriving from increased levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, now becomes a concern even for policy-makers within treaty regimes other than that of the UNFCCC, and necessitates new linkages between them. At the same time, the newly emerging technological possibilities such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) represent new options in the portfolio of tackling climate change. If they indeed represent a viable and promising avenue to address climate change, and if marine protection treaties stand in the way of such technology, then adaptation of marine protection treaties might be needed not necessarily to avoid conflicts with another treaty regime (UNFCCC), but because such action is needed to further the genuine aims of those treaties. As the term already indicates, CCS is a technology that allows for the capturing of carbon dioxide from emissions of fossil fuel operated plants, such as coal or gas plants. Different storage options for such emissions exist, including geological storage and ocean storage, by which the carbon dioxide is directly injected into the water column or deposited at 3000 meters depth where it is denser than water and", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "a04403a0cba4a66c94b9f0f3a3113846b9258053", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2333120755", "DOI": "10.1021/es303341j", "CorpusId": 19930004, "PubMed": "23286316"}, "title": "Two-in-one fuel combining sugar cane with low rank coal and its CO\u2082 reduction effects in pulverized-coal power plants.", "abstract": "Coal-fired power plants are facing to two major independent problems, namely, the burden to reduce CO(2) emission to comply with renewable portfolio standard (RPS) and cap-and-trade system, and the need to use low-rank coal due to the instability of high-rank coal supply. To address such unresolved issues, integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) with carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been suggested, and low rank coal has been upgraded by high-pressure and high-temperature processes. However, IGCC incurs huge construction costs, and the coal upgrading processes require fossil-fuel-derived additives and harsh operation condition. Here, we first show a hybrid coal that can solve these two problems simultaneously while using existing power plants. Hybrid coal is defined as a two-in-one fuel combining low rank coal with a sugar cane-derived bioliquid, such as molasses and sugar cane juice, by bioliquid diffusion into coal intrapores and precarbonization of the bioliquid. Unlike the simple blend of biomass and coal showing dual combustion behavior, hybrid coal provided a single coal combustion pattern. If hybrid coal (biomass/coal ratio = 28 wt %) is used as a fuel for 500 MW power generation, the net CO(2) emission is 21.2-33.1% and 12.5-25.7% lower than those for low rank coal and designed coal, and the required coal supply can be reduced by 33% compared with low rank coal. Considering high oil prices and time required before a stable renewable energy supply can be established, hybrid coal could be recognized as an innovative low-carbon-emission energy technology that can bridge the gulf between fossil fuels and renewable energy, because various water-soluble biomass could be used as an additive for hybrid coal through proper modification of preparation conditions.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "5ad5387faff58f2fe28457a8034f9c71458fc368", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2915199303", "DOI": "10.3390/SU11051250", "CorpusId": 92993043}, "title": "Opportunities for Mineral Carbonation in Australia\u2019s Mining Industry", "abstract": "Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) via mineral carbonation is an effective method for long-term storage of carbon dioxide and combating climate change.

To date, technological and economic barriers have inhibited broad-scale utilisation of mineral carbonation at industrial scales. This paper outlines the mineral carbonation process; discusses drivers and barriers of mineral carbonation deployment in Australian mining; and, finally, proposes a unique approach to commercially viable CCUS within the Australian mining industry by integrating mine waste management with mine site rehabilitation, and leveraging relationships with local coal-fired power station. This paper discusses using alkaline mine and coal-fired power station waste (fly ash, red mud, and ultramafic mine tailings, i.e., nickel, diamond, PGE (platinum group elements), and legacy asbestos mine tailings) as the feedstock for CCUS to produce environmentally benign materials, which can be used in mine reclamation. Geographical proximity of mining operations, mining waste storage facilities and coal-fired power stations in Australia are identified; and possible synergies between them are discussed. This paper demonstrates that large-scale alkaline waste production and mine site reclamation can become integrated to mechanise CCUS. Furthermore, financial liabilities associated with such waste management and site reclamation could overcome many of the current economic setbacks of retrofitting CCUS in the mining industry.

Attributional Life Cycle Assessment for generation of 1.0 MWh was applied in the analysis. None of the scenarios accumulated the best indexes in all dimensions. Regarding GWP, S4 totals the positive effects of using CaL to reduce CO2 from TEC and TGN, but the CH4 emissions increased due to its energy requirements. As for PED, S1 and S2 are similar and presented higher performances than S3 and S4. The price of natural gas compromises the use of CaL in TGN. A combined verification of the three analysis dimensions, proved that S2 was the best option of the series due to the homogeneity of its indices.

Although there were marked impacts of grazing pressure on above ground vegetation composition, structure and biomass, there was no detectable relationship between grazing intensity and soil organic carbon, irrespective of tidal zone in the marsh or soil depth-layer analyzed. A substantial spatial variation in soil carbon was instead explained by contextual environmental variables. There was evidence that compensatory responses by vegetation, such as increased root growth, countered carbon loss from grazing impacts.

Unfortunately, the increased amount of anthropogenic carbon emitted during the energy production leads to environmental issues, including climate change. Thus, reducing carbon dioxide emissions in order to stabilize atmospheric CO2 levels is crucial, and this would not be achieved without significant changes in the energy conversion processes and the implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Currently, the geological storage of carbon dioxide is considered to be the most economical method of carbon sequestration, while mineral carbonation is a relatively new and less explored method of sequestering CO2. The advantage of carbon mineral sequestration is that it is the most permanent and safe method of carbon storage, since the gaseous carbon dioxide is fixed into a solid matrix of Mg-bearing minerals (e.g., serpentine) forming a thermodynamically stable solid product. The current drawback of carbon mineral sequestration is its relatively high cost. Therefore, this study focuses on tailored synthesis of high purity precipitated magnesium carbonate (PMC) to mimic commercially available CaCO3-based filler materials, while sequestering CO2. The effects of pH, reaction time and reaction temperature on the mean particle size, particle size distribution, and particle morphological structures, have been investigated for the synthesis of magnesium carbonates as carbon-neutral filler materials.

In principle, carbon dioxide could be captured from any carbon dioxide point source. In the practice of present technological innovations, business strategies, and policy developments, CCS is most often coupled to coal power plants. However, there are many point sources of carbon dioxide that are not directly related to coal or even fossil fuels. For instance, many forms of bio-energy or biomass-based processes generate significant streams of carbon dioxide emissions.

The desire to alleviate the global warming problem has resulted in a serious environmental concern and a need to either reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial sources or put them into long term storage. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the largest contributor to the global warming problem, and is thus the major target for the reduction. Among the capture techniques, the flue gas scrubbing using absorption solvents is the most mature and readily applied technology for the reduction of CO2 emissions from the stationary power plants. 2 Aqueous solutions of alkanolamines are the chemical solvents that have been used extensively for the CO2 capture. 3 Common alkanolamines are monoethanolamine (MEA), diglycolamine (DGA), diethanolamine (DEA), diisopropanolamine (DIPA) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). At present, formulated solutions containing a variety of alkanolamines are gaining popularity in the gas separation industry. These solutions often provide a greater absorption performance or meet unique needs when compared to the aqueous solutions of single alkanolamines.

The capture and recycling of CO2 to methanol offers a pathway to a sustainable carbon neutral cycle that would be an anthropogenic equivalent to nature\u2019s own carbon cycle.

Hydrogen is the preferred fuel for fuel cells. Storing hydrogen in the form of methanol avoids the cumbersome, expensive and potentially dangerous storage of hydrogen at very high pressures or under cryogenic conditions. When needed, the hydrogen can be easily liberated by methanol reforming with water.

The application of the work is for carbon dioxide (CO2) storage in aquifers, where capillary trapping is a rapid and effective mechanism to render the injected fluid immobile: the CO2 is injected into the formation followed by chase brine injection or natural groundwater flow that displaces and traps it. Current models to predict the amount of trapping are based on experiments in consolidated media; while CO2 is likely to be injected at depths greater than around 800 m to render it super-critical, it may be injected into formations that tend to have a higher porosity and permeability than deep oilfield rocks. We use analogue fluids \u2013 water and refined oil \u2013 at ambient conditions. The initial conditions are established by injecting oil into vertical or horizontal sand packs 1 m long at different flow rates and then allowing the oil to migrate due to buoyancy forces. The packs are then flooded with water. The columns are sliced and the residual saturation measured with great accuracy and sensitivity by gas chromatography. This method allows low saturations to be measured reliably. The trapped saturation initially rises linearly with initial saturation to a value of around 0.11, followed by a constant residual as the initial saturation increases further. This behavior is not predicted by the traditional Land (1968) model, but is physically consistent with poorly consolidated media where most of the larger pores can easily be invaded at relatively low saturation and there is, overall, relatively little trapping. The best match to our experimental data was achieved with the Aissaoui (1983) trapping model. Introduction If we are to avoid potentially dangerous climate change, we need to capture and store CO2 emitted by fossil-fuel burning power stations and other industrial plants (Orr, 2004). Saline aquifers provide the largest potential for storage and the widest geographical spread (Hawkes et al., 2005). Subsequent leakage of CO2 into the atmosphere, even over hundreds of years, would render any sequestration scheme inefficient. However, based on the experience of the oil and gas industry, there is a good understanding of trapping mechanisms that take place in geological formations. Hydrodynamic trapping is the primary mechanism by which hydrocarbons accumulate in the subsurface. The same mechanism would take place during carbon sequestration, with the less dense CO2 rising due to buoyancy forces until it is trapped under impermeable cap-rock (Bachu et al., 1994). However, this process relies on there being an intact barrier to upwards flow. Solution trapping occurs when there is dissolution of CO2 in the aquifer brine. The CO2 saturated brine is denser than the surrounding brine leading to convective mixing where the denser brine migrates deeper into the formation (Lindeberg and Wessel-Berg, 1997; Riaz et al., 2006; Ennis-King and Paterson, 2005). Mineral trapping occurs over longer timescales than other trapping methods. As CO2 dissolves in formation brine carbonic acid is formed (H2CO3) which dissociates and can subsequently react with the host rock or brine to generate solid minerals over periods of thousands to billions of years (Gunter and Perkins, 1993; Gunter et al., 1997; Egermann et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2008). The final trapping mechanism involves CO2 becoming immobile at the pore scale by capillary forces. This process occurs as the CO2 migrates upwards, when it is displaced by natural groundwater flow or by the injection of chase brine. It is a rapid and effective trapping mechanism that reduces the need to ensure cap-rock integrity (Kumar et al., 2005; Hesse et al., 2006; Obi and Blunt, 2006; Juanes et al., 2006; Qi et al., 2007; Saadatpoor et al., 2008).", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "f1d035a64c3b46118dfe8a14d5e5b740796d26e1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2892191428", "DOI": "10.1021/ACS.ENERGYFUELS.8B02352", "CorpusId": 106049263}, "title": "Mechanochemical Synthesis of Tannic Acid-Fe Coordination Compound and Its Derived Porous Carbon for CO2 Adsorption", "abstract": "A tannic acid-Fe coordination compound has been prepared via a simple mechanochemical method.

Many of these wells have injected millions of gallons of liquid waste annually into Knox reservoirs. The relative scale of these injection operations can be used to estimate the types and sizes of potential reservoirs within the Knox succession in the Midwest. Specific data on the Knox interval relative to its carbon storage and confining potential are currently being collected from wells drilled as part of U.S. Department of Energy administered carbon storage projects, as well as state-administered carbon storage programs. In this chapter, initial results of carbon storage tests are summarized from the Battelle 1 Duke Energy well, Kentucky Geological Survey 1 Blan well, Battelle-American Electric Power (AEP) 1 Mountaineer well, and Battelle-Ohio Geological Survey 1 CO2 well. The AEP Mountaineer Power Plant will host the nation's first commercially integrated carbon capture and geologic storage project, and the storage reservoirs will be in the Knox Group. Because the Knox Group is widespread at depth across much of the Midwest, it will be an important part of sequestration programs as confining interval and reservoir.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "6be4180bfc6543d60e077bcaf9cad24ffbc29e21", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3038552219", "DOI": "10.1039/d0ee01107j", "CorpusId": 225460795}, "title": "Prospects for bioenergy with carbon capture & storage (BECCS) in the United States pulp and paper industry", "abstract": "The pulp and paper industry utilizes more biomass for stationary heat and power than any other industry in the United States. In total, pulp and paper mills in the US emit \u223c150 million metric tons of CO2 each year, of which 77% is biogenic. Thus, the pulp and paper industry has significant potential to indirectly remove atmospheric CO2 through bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS). In addition, avenues for CO2 utilization exist in pulp and paper processing. Here, we analyze the technical and economic potential of integrating carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) technologies at pulp and paper mills in the US through top-down, industry-wide screening and bottom-up, chemical process modeling techniques. We estimate costs of capturing and transporting CO2 from pulp and paper mills using post-combustion amine chemisorption in the year 2026 with application of the existing federal tax credit for carbon capture and sequestration (Section 45Q). Costs are highly dependent on scenario-specific details, such as waste heat or power generation at the mill, idling or stranded assets, and proximity to suitable geologic storage opportunities. Some CCS implementation scenarios produce significant economic returns for pulp and paper mills, indicating a near-term opportunity to accelerate CCS in the US. Finally, we qualitatively assess alternative techniques for CO2 capture through process innovation, and opportunities for CO2 utilization at pulp and paper mills.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "cc7137752a3a567130e5a98ce3411ae8040b5290", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/cce/dAmoreSIBS19", "MAG": "2963375160", "DOI": "10.1016/J.COMPCHEMENG.2019.106521", "CorpusId": 199683425}, "title": "European supply chains for carbon capture, transport and sequestration, with uncertainties in geological storage capacity: Insights from economic optimisation", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "54c24b4db9b66a416d9be4813cfd13a2ed097a09", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1508499402", "CorpusId": 106827598}, "title": "Leakage and atmospheric dispersion of CO2 associated with carbon capture and storage projects", "abstract": "Climate change is affecting planet Earth. The main cause is anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, the principal one being carbon dioxide, released in the atmosphere as a by-product of the combustion of hydrocarbons for the generation of energy. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that would prevent carbon dioxide from being emitted into the atmosphere by safely sequestering it underground. For so doing, CO2 must be captured at large emission points and transported at high pressure to underground reservoirs, where the gas can be injected and stored for thousands of years to come. During surface transportation, leakages from high pressure facilities would pose a risk to the general public, for carbon dioxide is toxic at high concentrations. \n\nIn this study, atmospheric dispersion of carbon dioxide is studied by the usage of software that solves mathematical equations and algorithms simulating the pollutant dispersion. Dispersion models are used to estimate or predict downwind distances covered by toxic concentrations of the pollutant, emitted from sources such as high-pressure transportation facilities within CCS projects. Two modelling tools from two different classes (Gaussian ALOHA 5.4 and Computational Fluid Dynamics PANACHE 3.4.1) have been evaluated against release field experiments using the statistical model evaluation method proposed by Hanna et al. (1993,2004) and Hanna and Chang (2001), and applied for the consideration of the dense gas CO2, released in large amounts due to leakages.\n\nPredictions from the two models have been compared and the limitations of both examined, when dealing with a gas that presents the distinctive physical characteristics of carbon dioxide. The models have been used and compared in simulating representative failure cases within CCS transportation with release parameters taken from the literature. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model showed a much higher precision when describing the release of the gas from a HP facility, mainly when dealing with the jet release caused by leakages of any dimensions. \n\nWhen dealing with the transportation of toxic gases, the magnitude of hazards posed by potential failure events within the transportation system is proportional to the extent of the area covered by toxic concentrations of the gas, when modelling representative leakages. Results of this investigation depict a lowering of the Risk involved in the transportation of CO2 by up to an order of magnitude, when modelling the same releases with CFD tools, instead of the more common Gaussian models. \n\nThe European Union recognizes that deployment of CCS for hydrocarbon power generation, in parallel with the production of renewable energies, is the only way to meet the target for temperature stabilization. For its Impact Assessment on CCS, the EU used results from a risk assessment compiled after the utilization of a Gaussian model. In this thesis, a criticism of this choice is put forward, considering that, when introducing the technology to the general public and regional scale administrators, a Risk Assessment derived using results from Gaussian models can over-estimate the risk in a way not favourable to the purpose.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "ee83a3b46a8dbaea2e2a5c88e107827b5562eccb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2152054927", "DOI": "10.1007/S11027-005-9003-8", "CorpusId": 154872230}, "title": "Global Biomass Energy Potential", "abstract": "The intensive use of renewable energy is one of the options to stabilize CO2atmospheric concentration at levels of 350 to 550ppm. A recent evaluation of the global potential of primary renewable energy carried out by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sets a value of at least 2800EJ/yr, which is more than the most energy-intensive SRES scenario forecast for the world energy requirement up to the year 2100. Nevertheless, what is really important to quantify is the amount of final energy since the use of renewable sources may involve conversion efficiencies, from primary to final energy, different from the ones of conventional energy sources. In reality, IPCC does not provide a complete account of the final energy from renewables, but the text claims that using several available options to mitigate climate change, and renewables is only one of them, it is possible to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration at a low level. In this paper, we evaluate in detail biomass primary and final energy using sugarcane crop as a proxy, since it is one of the highest energy density forms of biomass, and through afforestation/reforestation using a model presented in IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). The conclusion is that the primary-energy potential for biomass has been under-evaluated by many authors and by IPCC, and this under-evaluation is even larger for final energy since sugarcane allows co-production of electricity and liquid fuel. Regarding forests we reproduce IPCC results for primary energy and calculate final energy. Sugarcane is a tropical crop and cannot be grown in all the land area forecasted for biomass energy plantation in the IPCC/TAR evaluation (i.e. 1280Mha). Nevertheless, there are large expanses of unexploited land, mainly in Latin America and Africa that are subject to warm weather and convenient rainfall. With the use of 143Mha of these lands it is possible to produce 164EJ/yr (1147GJ/hayr or 3.6W/m2on average) of primary energy and 90EJ/yr of final energy in the form of liquid fuel (alcohol) and electricity, using agricultural productivities near the best ones already achievable and biomass gasification technology. More remarkable is that these results can be obtained with the operation of 4,000 production units with unitary capacity similar to the largest currently in operation. These units should be spread over the tropical land area yielding a plantation density similar to the one presently observed in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, where alcohol and electricity have been commercialized in a cost-effective way for several years. Such an amount of final energy would be sufficiently large to fulfill all the expected global increase in oil demand, as well as in electricity consumption by 2030, assuming the energy demand of such sources continues to grow at the same pace observed over the last two decades. When sugarcane crops are combined with afforestation/reforestation it is possible to show that carbon emissions decline for some IPCC SRES scenarios by 2030, 2040 and 2050. Such energy alternatives significantly reduce CO2emissions by displacing fossil fuels and promote sustainable development through the creation of millions of direct and indirect jobs. Also, it opens an opportunity for negative CO2emissions when coupled with carbon dioxide capture and storage.", "year": 2006}]}
