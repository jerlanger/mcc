In depleted reservoirs, full or near-miscibility of injected CO2 with oil is difficult to achieve, and immiscible CO2 injection leaves a large volume of oil behind and limits available pore volume (PV) for storing CO2. In this paper, we present an experimental study to delineate the effect of ethanol-treated CO2 injection on oil recovery, net CO2 stored, and amount of ethanol left in the reservoir.\n We inject CO2 and ethanol-treated CO2 into Bentheimer Sandstone cores representing reservoirs. The oil phase consists of a mixture of 0.65 hexane and 0.35 decane (C6-C10 mixture) by molar fraction in one set of experimental runs, and pure decane (C10) in the other set of experimental runs. All experimental runs are conducted at constant temperature 70\u00b0C and various pressures to exhibit immiscibility (9.0\u2009MPa for the C6-C10 mixture and 9.6\u2009MPa for pure C10) or near-miscibility (11.7\u2009MPa for the C6-C10 mixture and 12.1\u2009MPa for pure C10). Pressure differences across the core, oil recovery, and compositions and rates of the produced fluids are recorded during the experimental runs. Ultimate oil recovery under immiscibility is found to be 9 to 15% greater using ethanol-treated CO2 injection than that using pure CO2 injection. Net CO2 stored for pure C10 under immiscibility is found to be 0.134 PV greater during ethanol-treated CO2 injection than during pure CO2 injection. For the C6-C10 mixture under immiscibility, both ethanol-treated CO2 injection and CO2 injection yield the same net CO2 stored. However, for the C6-C10 mixture under near-miscibility,ethanol-treated CO2 injection is found to yield 0.161 PV less net CO2 stored than does pure CO2 injection. These results suggest potential improvement in oil recovery and net CO2 stored using ethanol-treated CO2 injection instead of pure CO2 injection. If economically viable, ethanol-treated CO2 injection could be used as a carbon capture, usage, and storage method in low-pressure reservoirs, for which pure CO2 injection would be infeasible.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "ddd15bbcf04d7e07c2fa79262d8c3231fe459502", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2752960368", "CorpusId": 134898439}, "title": "Design of a Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage System for Thermal Power Plants in Hokkaido", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "cd7703ca07a8173d567ac2fc7c504a671ef03201", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3092580922", "CorpusId": 226477846}, "title": "Efficient utilization of industrial excess heat for carbon capture and district heating", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) from fossil and biogenic (BECCS) emission sources is necessary to limit global warming to well below 2\u00b0C. The EU as well as Swedish national agencies emphasize the importance of CCS for emission intensive industries. However, the cost of implementing CCS is currently still higher than the cost of emitting CO2 via the EU ETS, for example. To incentivize rapid deployment of CCS, the concept of partial capture has been suggested, i.e. capturing only a fraction of the site emissions to reduce capture cost. Several studies have found that the utilization of excess heat from industrial processes could significantly reduce the capture cost as the heat required (~120\u00b0C) may be available in significant quantities. However, available excess heat will not be sufficient to power full capture at most industrial sites. In Sweden, many industries utilize all or part of their excess heat in heat recovery units or in combined heat and power (CHP) plants to produce electricity and deliver heat to municipal district heating (MDH) systems. A broad implementation of CCS will, thus, effect the availability of excess heat for industrial heat and power generation. The future product portfolio of industrial processes with excess heat export and CHP plants can therefore be expected to include not only heat and power production, but also climate services (CCS/BECCS) and grid services (frequency regulation due to intermittent renewables). The aim of this work is to assess partial capture at sites that have access to low-value excess heat to power the capture process, whilst considering competition from using the excess heat for MDH delivery. The work is based on process modelling and cost estimation of CO2 capture processes using amine absorption for two illustrative case studies, a refinery and a steel mill, which both currently use excess heat for MDH. The main focus is on investigating how seasonal variations in the availability of excess heat as well as the demand of district heating impact cost-efficient design and operation of partial capture at industrial sites. A challenge when utilizing excess heat in connection to a process connected to a district heating system is that the heat source which can be used to power part of the capture process will exhibit seasonal availability, and thus may inflict extra cost for the CCS plant not running at full load, and therefore may counteract the economic motivation for partial capture. To prevent this, heat integration between CCS and municipal district heating is investigated, for example by utilizing heat from the CO2 compression so that low-pressure steam is released from MDH to provide heat to capture CO2 whilst maintaining MDH supply. The design of the amine absorption capture process will have to handle significant load changes and still maintain high separation efficiency within hydrodynamic boundaries of the absorber and stripper columns. The cost of such operation will depend on the solvent circulation flows, the number of absorber columns (including packing and liquid collectors/distributors) and capacity of solvent buffer tanks for storing unused solvent during the winter season. Assuming that a constant amount of CO2 is avoided, the avoidance cost of CCS based on excess heat with seasonal heat load variations is compared to the avoidance cost of CCS based on the use of external fuel to achieve a constant heat load to the reboiler.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "f998d782db709ef5374409305b6c376735b91cca", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 212717302}, "title": "MARine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (MAREMIP)", "abstract": "Given the narrowing windows of opportunities to stay below 2\u00b0C, negative emission technologies such as Bioenergy with Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (BioCCS) play an ever more crucial role in meeting the 2\u00b0C stabilization target (Fuss et al. 2014). Negative emission technologies \u2013if deployable at a sufficiently large scale during the second half of this century \u2013would make the 2\u00b0C target more feasible in the midst of the slow political progress. However, such technologies are currently at their infancy and their future penetrations may fall short of the scale required to stabilize the warming (Scott et al. 2013). Furthermore, the overshoot in the mid-century prior to a full realization of negative emissions would give rise to a risk because such a temporal but excessive warming above 2\u00b0C might amplify itself by strengthening climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, which are known to be positive albeit with large uncertainties (Friedlingstein et al. 2006). When one considers other classes of carbon cycle feedbacks including those with permafrost thawing and wildfire, such a risk could be even higher. It has not been extensively assessed yet how carbon cycle feedbacks might play out during the overshoot in the context of negative emissions, while the literature on carbon cycle feedbacks has burgeoned in recent years. This study explores how 2\u00b0C stabilization pathways, in particular those which undergo overshoot, can be influenced by carbon cycle feedbacks and asks their climatic and economic consequences. We compute 2\u00b0C stabilization emissions scenarios under a cost-effectiveness principle, in which the total abatement costs are minimized such that the global warming is capped at 2\u00b0C. We employ a reduced-complexity model, the Aggregated Carbon Cycle, Atmospheric Chemistry, and Climate model (ACC2) (Tanaka et al., 2013), which comprises a box model of the global carbon cycle, simple parameterizations of the atmospheric chemistry, and a land-ocean energy balance model. The total abatement costs are estimated from the Marginal Abatement Cost functions for CO2, CH4, N2O, and BC, which are derived from Azar (2013). Our preliminary results show that, if carbon cycle feedbacks turn out to be stronger than what is known today, it would incur substantial abatement costs to keep up with the 2\u00b0C stabilization goal. Our results also suggest that it would be less expensive in the long run to plan for a 2\u00b0C stabilization pathway by considering strong carbon cycle feedbacks because it would cost more if we correct the emission pathway in the mid-century to adjust for unexpectedly large carbon cycle feedbacks during overshoot. Furthermore, our tentative results point to a key policy message: do not rely on negative emissions to achieve the 2\u00b0C target. It would make more sense to gear climate mitigation actions toward the stabilization target without betting on negative emissions because negative emissions might create large overshoot in case of strong feedbacks. Our simple approach illuminates a need for investigating this issue further by using a range of models including coupled Earth System Model (ESM)-Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).

One of the many interesting challenges associated with this technology involves quantitative modeling of the injection, migration, long-term fate, and possible leakage of the CO 2 as well as fluids displaced by the injected CO 2 . While several different kinds of formations may be targets for injection, deep saline aquifers have the largest storage capacity and are globally ubiquitous. As such, they are likely to be used for large-scale injection operations. Injection into deep saline aquifers involves two-phase flow with interphase mass transfer, strong gravity override, and unfavorable viscosity ratios. While the resulting problem can become quite complex mathematically, it may also be possible to simplify the system by taking advantage of characteristic length and time scales associated with the problem. These simplifications can be incorporated into a multi-scale modeling framework suitable for the CO 2 injection problem. In this presentation, multi-scale approaches that are specific to the CO 2 problem will be discussed, with a focus on models that take advantage of the strong buoyancy in the system.

Offshore storage can be linked to large point-sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) while avoiding many of the logistical difficulties and potential risks encountered when siting onshore projects, especially in densely populated areas of the East Coast of the United States. Offshore storage along mid-Atlantic region was studied under the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funded Mid-Atlantic U.S. Offshore Carbon Storage Resource Assessment Project (MAOCSRAP) and as a subtask under the Midwest Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (MRCSP). The assessment was conducted as a technical collaboration between Battelle, Rutgers University, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, state geological surveys of Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania, United States Geological Survey-Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center, and Harvard University. Major objectives were to complete a systematic carbon storage resource assessment of the of the mid-Atlantic offshore coastal region from the Georges Bank Basin (GBB) through the Long Island Platform (LIP) to the southern Baltimore Canyon Trough (BCT), examine offshore storage risk factors, and engage industry and regulatory stakeholders through development of a Road Map to assist future project planning and implementation. \nVarious publicly available data sets, such as seismic data, well-logs, and core data, were integrated to define geologic characteristics of candidate storage sites and calculate prospective CO2 storage resources for Cretaceous- and Jurassic-age sandstone sequences of the mid-Atlantic offshore sub-regions. The combined dataset helped to identify and map potential storage zones within sequences of the Logan Canyon, Missisauga, and Mohawk formations, as well as the regionally extensive caprock comprised of the Dawson Canyon shale. Prospective storage resource estimates and formation-specific storage efficiency values were calculated with static volumetric and dynamic methods. Regional-scale estimates range from 150 to 1136 gigatonnes (Gt) for the combined storage zones, with high estimated storage resource (\u2265 2.4 megatonnes [Mt] CO2/km2) occurring in the northern BCT near the Great Stone Dome (GSD) structure. Results of local scale simplified dynamic reservoir simulation in the GSD indicate that injection rates of 1 Mt CO2/year may be sustained within the time and pressure constraints assumed for a commercial storage project. \nAn initial, qualitative assessment of technical risk factors present in mid-Atlantic offshore areas was conducted. Overall, the mid-Atlantic offshore area benefits from the large spatial extent, thick sequences of sands, lack of previous oil and gas wellbores, and distance from populated development. Geomechanical stability, reservoir variability, and soft sediment deformation were identified as moderate risk factors in some areas. No highly critical risk factors were identified that would impede CO2 storage along the study areas. \nInput and participation from government, industry, and environmental groups helped to address next steps needed for future CCS project planning and implementation in the study region. Recommended near-term actions are to develop site screening through advanced geologic modeling, implement stakeholder outreach and risk mitigation strategies, identify industry and research goals, and develop regulatory pathways. Recommended mid-term actions are to validate subsurface properties with new data, conduct a cost-benefit analysis, and develop a monitoring, verification, and accounting (MVA) plan. Long term-recommended actions are to implement a plan for large-scale CCS operations using the previous findings, conduct site design, permitting, and construction, and upscale infrastructure.

In addition to this scheme, we propose a Window-based Direct Address Counting (WDAC) algorithm to approximate an ideal hot data identification as our baseline. Unlike the existing baseline algorithm that cannot appropriately capture recency information due to its exponential batch decay, our WDAC algorithm, using a sliding window concept, can capture very fine-grained recency information.

Technically, air capture is not a new technology; industrial applications can be traced back to the 1930s. This paper explores the feasibility of this technology as a climate change mitigation option. Two different pathways of air capture are assessed: direct air capture, which uses a chemical process to capture CO2, and biomass coupled with CO2 capture and storage (CCS), which utilizes the biological process of photosynthesis to remove CO2 from the air. We find that direct air capture has prohibitively high mitigation costs compared to the costs of climate change mitigation options being considered today. The pathway of biomass coupled with CCS has much more reasonable costs and could be used to offset certain emissions. However, the large land requirement may limit the amount of offsets available. We conclude that relying on air capture technology to play a major role in mitigating carbon emissions is a very risky policy decision. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To avoid the obvious consequences on climate change, the concentration of such greenhouse gases in the atmosphere must be stabilized. But, as populations grow and economies develop, future demands now ensure that energy will be one of the defining issues of this century. This unique set of (coupled) challenges also means that science and engineering have a unique opportunity\u2014and a burgeoning challenge\u2014to apply their understanding to provide sustainable energy solutions. Integrated carbon capture and subsequent sequestration is generally advanced as the most promising option to tackle greenhouse gases in the short to medium term. Here, we provide a brief overview of an alternative mid- to long-term option, namely, the capture and conversion of CO2, to produce sustainable, synthetic hydrocarbon or carbonaceous fuels, most notably for transportation purposes. Basically, the approach centres on the concept of the large-scale re-use of CO2 released by human activity to produce synthetic fuels, and how this challenging approach could assume an important role in tackling the issue of global CO2 emissions. We highlight three possible strategies involving CO2 conversion by physico-chemical approaches: sustainable (or renewable) synthetic methanol, syngas production derived from flue gases from coal-, gas- or oil-fired electric power stations, and photochemical production of synthetic fuels. The use of CO2 to synthesize commodity chemicals is covered elsewhere (Arakawa et al. 2001 Chem. Rev. 101, 953\u2013996); this review is focused on the possibilities for the conversion of CO2 to fuels.

Here, we hope to illustrate that advances in the science and engineering of materials are critical for these new energy technologies, and specific examples are given for all three examples.

A feed strategy of step-wise increasing organic loading rate (OLR) by either increasing feed MEAw concentration or the hydraulic loading rate was applied. The system performance was evaluated by chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency, methane yield, MEA removal, and the accumulation of ammonia and volatile fatty acid (VFA).

CAs are metalloenzymes, and they equilibrate the reaction between three simple but essential chemical species: CO 2 , bicarbonate and protons. All of them are essential molecules/ions in many important physiologic processes in all life kingdoms (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya), throughout the tree of life, and for this reason, relatively high amounts of these enzymes are present in different tissues/cell compartments of most investigated organisms. Drugs interfering with the activity of the CAs have been clinically used for almost 60 years, most of them belonging to the sulfonamide class. Inhibition of the CAs has pharmacologic applications in many fields, such as antiglaucoma, anticonvulsant, antiobesity, and anticancer agents/diagnostic tools, but their use is also emerging for designing anti-infectives, i.e., antifungal and antibacterial agents with a novel mechanism of action. As a consequence, the drug design of CA inhibitors (CAIs) is a highly dynamic field. Sulfonamides and their isosteres (sulfamates/sulfamides) constitute the main class of CAIs, which bind to the metal ion from the enzyme active site, and have been in clinical use for decades. Lately other families of CAIs were reported, which possess a distinct mechanism of action compared to the sulfonamides: the phenols, polyamines, some carboxylates and sulfocoumarins, were shown to anchor to the zinc-coordinated water molecule from the enzyme active site. Coumarins and some lactones were shown to be pro-drug inhibitors, binding in hydrolyzed form at the entrance of the active site cavity. Novel drug design strategies have been reported principally based on the tail approach for obtaining all these types of CAIs, which exploit more external binding regions within the enzyme active site (in addition to coordination to the metal ion), leading thus to isoformselective compounds. Sugar-based tails as well as click chemistry were the most fruitful developments of the tail approach. Promising compounds that inhibit CAs from bacterial and fungal pathogens, of the dithiocarbamate, phenol and carboxylate types have also been reported lately. But recently, due to the steep increase in the CO 2 concentration in the atmosphere and the green house effects of this gas, a lot of research concentrated on the biotechnologic use of various CAs, some of which were isolated from not so common vertebrates and even extremophilic bacteria, with the goal of using the high catalytic activity of such enzymes for capturing CO 2 . Such a \u201cgreen\u201d, novel approach for CO 2 capture may resolve the stringent problem of global warming in an efficient and elegant manner.

Negative emission technologies \u2013if deployable at a sufficiently large scale during the second half of this century \u2013would make the 2\u00b0C target more feasible in the midst of the slow political progress. However, such technologies are currently at their infancy and their future penetrations may fall short of the scale required to stabilize the warming (Scott et al. 2013). Furthermore, the overshoot in the mid-century prior to a full realization of negative emissions would give rise to a risk because such a temporal but excessive warming above 2\u00b0C might amplify itself by strengthening climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, which are known to be positive albeit with large uncertainties (Friedlingstein et al. 2006). When one considers other classes of carbon cycle feedbacks including those with permafrost thawing and wildfire, such a risk could be even higher. It has not been extensively assessed yet how carbon cycle feedbacks might play out during the overshoot in the context of negative emissions, while the literature on carbon cycle feedbacks has burgeoned in recent years. This study explores how 2\u00b0C stabilization pathways, in particular those which undergo overshoot, can be influenced by carbon cycle feedbacks and asks their climatic and economic consequences. We compute 2\u00b0C stabilization emissions scenarios under a cost-effectiveness principle, in which the total abatement costs are minimized such that the global warming is capped at 2\u00b0C. We employ a reduced-complexity model, the Aggregated Carbon Cycle, Atmospheric Chemistry, and Climate model (ACC2) (Tanaka et al., 2013), which comprises a box model of the global carbon cycle, simple parameterizations of the atmospheric chemistry, and a land-ocean energy balance model. The total abatement costs are estimated from the Marginal Abatement Cost functions for CO2, CH4, N2O, and BC, which are derived from Azar (2013). Our preliminary results show that, if carbon cycle feedbacks turn out to be stronger than what is known today, it would incur substantial abatement costs to keep up with the 2\u00b0C stabilization goal. Our results also suggest that it would be less expensive in the long run to plan for a 2\u00b0C stabilization pathway by considering strong carbon cycle feedbacks because it would cost more if we correct the emission pathway in the mid-century to adjust for unexpectedly large carbon cycle feedbacks during overshoot. Furthermore, our tentative results point to a key policy message: do not rely on negative emissions to achieve the 2\u00b0C target. It would make more sense to gear climate mitigation actions toward the stabilization target without betting on negative emissions because negative emissions might create large overshoot in case of strong feedbacks. Our simple approach illuminates a need for investigating this issue further by using a range of models including coupled Earth System Model (ESM)-Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).

Despite considerable research and demonstration of the technologies involved, concerns still exist over the ability to accurately monitor the migration of CO2 injected into the subsurface for storage. In this study, we aim to assess the viability of using the inherent isotopic compositions of industrially sourced CO2 to monitor the fate and migration of CO2 injected for storage. Determining the isotopic fingerprints contained in both the innate reservoir fluids and the injected CO2, would allow for a better understanding of the processes that can change the geochemical fingerprint of CO2 during injection, storage and any subsequent migration. This will then establish the effectiveness of using inherent isotopic fingerprints as tracers. The Carbon Management Canada Research Institute, in collaboration with the University of Calgary, have developed a purpose built Field Research Station (FRS) near Brooks, Alberta. The FRS allows for the controlled, shallow, subsurface release of industrially sourced CO2, which will enable a large-scale study of how CO2 behaves if it migrates from a storage site at depth. CO2 will be injected into a predominantly water filled, sandstone formation at a depth of 300m. A range of geophysical and geochemical monitoring techniques are being carried out via two wells to monitor for CO2 breakthrough, and for evidence of increased gas migration at the surface from either CO2 or methane. In order to further understand the geochemical profile of the site, baseline samples were collected prior to CO2 injection from injection, monitoring and water wells in November 2016, March 2017 and July 2017.

II. EU-level analysis", "abstract": "BackgroundForests and the forest sector may play an important role in mitigating climate change. The Paris Agreement and the recent legislative proposal to include the land use sector in the EU 2030 climate targets reflect this expectation. However, greater confidence on estimates from national greenhouse gas inventories (GHGI) and more comprehensive analyses of mitigation options are needed to seize this mitigation potential. The aim of this paper is to provide a tool at EU level for verifying the EU GHGI and for simulating specific policy and forest management scenarios. Therefore, the Carbon Budget Model (CBM) was applied for an integrated assessment of the EU forest carbon (C) balance from 2000 to 2012, including: (i) estimates of the C stock and net CO2 emissions for forest management (FM), afforestation/reforestation (AR) and deforestation (D), covering carbon in both the forest and the harvest wood product (HWP) pools; (ii) an overall analysis of the C dynamics associated with harvest and natural disturbances (mainly storms and fires); (iii) a comparison of our estimates with the data reported in the EU GHGI.ResultsOverall, the average annual FM sink (\u2212365 Mt CO2 year\u22121) estimated by the CBM in the period 2000\u20132012 corresponds to about 7\u00a0% of total GHG emissions at the EU level for the same period (excluding land use, land-use change and forestry). The HWP pool sink (\u221244 Mt CO2 year\u22121) contributes an additional 1\u00a0%. Emissions from D (about 33 Mt CO2 year\u22121) are more than compensated by the sink in AR (about 43 Mt CO2 year\u22121 over the period). For FM, the estimates from the CBM were about 8\u00a0% lower than the EU GHGI, a value well within the typical uncertainty range of the EU forest sink estimates. For AR and D the match with the EU GHGI was nearly perfect (difference\u00a0<\u00b12\u00a0% in the period 2008\u20132012). Our analysis on harvest and natural disturbances shows that: (i) the impact of harvest is much greater than natural disturbances but, because of salvage logging (often very relevant), the impact of natural disturbances is often not easily distinguishable from the impact of harvest, and (ii) the impact of storms on the biomass C stock is 5\u201310 times greater than fires, but while storms cause only indirect emissions (i.e., a transfer of C from living biomass to dead organic matter), fires cause both direct and indirect emissions.ConclusionsThis study presents the application of a consistent methodological approach, based on an inventory-based model, adapted to the forest management conditions of EU countries. The approach captures, with satisfactory detail, the C sink reported in the EU GHGI and the country-specific variability due to harvest, natural disturbances and land-use changes. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive study of its kind at EU level, i.e., including all the forest pools, HWP and natural disturbances, and a comparison with the EU GHGI.

The mesoporous structure was confirmed by N2 adsorption isotherm at 77 K, and the characterization of the bulk and surface properties performed by ICP analysis, TEM, XRD, and XPS. The maximum hydrogen uptakes were found on N-MC (1.1 wt% of hydrogen) at 100 bar and RT and on MC (3.07 wt% of hydrogen) at 40 bar and 77 K. Due to the extremely low content of micropores, a clear relation between the presence of N atoms and the higher hydrogen storage at room temperature was observed. To the other hand, at liquid nitrogen temperature, the differences in surface area and micropore volume confirmed to be the most important factors on hydrogen storage ability [1].\nThe same porous carbon materals have been used as adsorbents of liquid pollutants. In comparison to classical activated carbon materials with micropores (<1.5nm), such mesoporous carbon materials (pore size from 2 to 50 nm) have advantages in the transportation of molecules [2]. In this work, heat-flow microcalorimetry was used to study the adsorption behaviours of phenol and nicotine in aqueous solution. Three kinds of mesoporous carbon materials namely MC, N-MC, C3N4-MC were used as adsorbents. The adsorption capacities of the adsorbents used were determined and presented in the form of adsorption isotherms. The adsorption isotherms were then interpreted by Langmuir, Freundlich and Sip\u2019s equations. In addition, the regeneration possibility of adsorbents was also studied by thermal desorption technique. The three kinds of adsorbents showed different behaviours according to their surface properties.\n\nReferences :\n[1] J. CAI, S. BENNICI, A. AUROUX, Mat.

The primary goal of the project is to determine an optimum strategy for minimizing greenhouse gas intensity in the southwestern United States. The Southwest Regional Partnership is led by the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology and comprises a large diverse group of expert organizations and individuals specializing in carbon sequestration science and engineering, as well as public policy and outreach. In 2000, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in Colorado exceeded 83.5 mmt (92 million tons) and are projected to increase by 2.4% per year through 2025. Nearly 76% of these emissions results from activities in the utility and transportation sectors. Power generation in the state relies primarily on coal, and as a result, 38 mmt (42 million tons) of CO2, or 46% of the total emissions in Colorado, is emitted from power plants in the utility sector. These stationary point sources afford the possibility of capture and separation of CO2 for transport to and storage at nearby sinks. The remaining 54% of Colorado's emissions result from the transportation, industrial, residential, and commercial sectors. Although CO2 sink potential is widely distributed across the state, characterization efforts focused on seven pilot study regions defined on the basis of maximum diversity in potential sequestration options relatively close to large CO2 sources. Using both geologic and mineralization options, carbon storage capacity within these regions is an estimated 653 billion t (720 billion tons). With the availability of suitable technology, the pilot areas have the potential of providing a long-term storage solution based on 2000 CO2 emission levels. The highest CO2 sequestration capacity potential for Colorado lies within the oil, gas, coalbed, and saline aquifer reservoirs of the Denver, Canon City, Piceance, and Sand Wash basins.

In fact, in 2007, the company consumed 3,498,500 kW-\u00ad\u2010hr of electricity in their operations, which is equivalent to the electricity of 328 households. For this project, CTE and TDI developed and tested a prototype flywheel-\u00ad\u2010based energy recovery and storage system. This technology is being developed at TDI\u2019s facilities to capture and reuse the energy necessary for the company\u2019s core process. The new technology and equipment is expected to save approximately 80% of the energy used in the TDI process, reducing total annual consumption of power by approximately 60%, saving approximately two million kilowatt-\u00ad\u2010hours annually. Additionally, the energy recycling system will allow TDI and other end users to lower their peak power demand and reduce associated utility demand charges. The use of flywheels in this application is novel and requires significant development work from TDI. Flywheels combine low maintenance costs with very high cycle life with little to no degradation over time, resulting in lifetimes measured in decades. All of these features make flywheels a very attractive option compared to other forms of energy storage, including batteries. Development and deployment of this energy recycling technology will reduce energy consumption during jet engine and stationary turbine development. By reengineering the current inefficient testing process, TDI will reduce risk and time to market of efficiency upgrades of gas turbines across the entire spectrum of applications. Once in place the results from this program will also help other US industries to utilize energy recycling technology to lower domestic energy use and see higher net energy efficiency. The prototype system and results will be used to seek additional resources to carry out full deployment of a system.

In this context, CO2 sequestration into depleted oil reservoirs is a practical approach as it boosts the oil recovery and facilitates the permanent storing of CO2 into the candidate sites. However, the estimation of CO2 storage capacity in subsurfaces is a challenge to kick-start CCS worldwide. Thus, this paper proposes an integrated static and dynamic modeling framework to tackle the challenge of CO2 storage capacity in a clastic reservoir, S1A filed, Masila basin, Yemen. To achieve this work's ultimate goal, the geostatistical modeling was integrated with open-source code (MRST-CO2lab) for reducing the uncertainty assessment of CO2 storage capacity. Also, there is a significant difference between static and dynamic CO2 storage capacity. The static CO2 storage capacity varies from 4.54 to 81.98 million tons, while the dynamic CO2 simulation is estimated from 4.95 to 17.92 million tons. Based on the geological uncertainty assessment of three ranked realizations (P10, P50, P90), our work was found that the upper Qinshn sequence could store 15.64 Million tons without leakage.

Minimizing the turbine inlet temperature (i.e., no extra fuel supplied to the combustor) resulted in higher net cycle efficiency.

Nevertheless, most frugivory interactions involve both benefits and disadvantages for plants, and the net interaction outcomes thus tend to vary along a continuum from mutualism to antagonism. Quantifying outcome variation is challenging and the ecological contribution of frugivorous animals to plant demography thus remains little explored. This is particularly true for interactions in which animals do not ingest entire fruits, that is in seed\u2010eating and pulp\u2010eating. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of Neotropical palm\u2013frugivore interactions, with a focus on how frugivore consumption behaviour (i.e. digestive processing, fruit\u2010handling ability and caching behaviour) and feeding types (fruit\u2010eating, pulp\u2010eating and seed\u2010eating) influence interaction outcomes at different demographic stages of palms. We compiled a total of 1043 species\u2010level palm\u2013frugivore interaction records that explicitly captured information on which parts of palm fruits are eaten by animals. These records showed consumption of fruits of 106 Neotropical palm species by 273 vertebrate species, especially birds (50%) and mammals (45%), but also fish (3%) and reptiles (2%). Fruit\u2010eating involved all four taxonomic vertebrate classes whereas seed\u2010eating and pulp\u2010eating were only recorded among birds and mammals. Most fruit\u2010eating interactions (77%) resulted in positive interaction outcomes for plants (e.g. gut\u2010passed seeds are viable or seeds are successfully dispersed), regardless of the digestive processing type of vertebrate consumers (seed defecation versus regurgitation). The majority of pulp\u2010eating interactions (91%) also resulted in positive interaction outcomes, for instance via pulp removal that promoted seed germination or via dispersal of intact palm seeds by external transport, especially if animals have a good fruit\u2010handling ability (e.g. primates, and some parrots). By contrast, seed\u2010eating interactions mostly resulted in dual outcomes (60%), where interactions had both negative effects on seed survival and positive outcomes through seed caching and external (non\u2010digestive) seed dispersal. A detailed synthesis of available field studies with qualitative and quantitative information provided evidence that 12 families and 27 species of mammals and birds are predominantly on the mutualistic side of the continuum whereas five mammalian families, six mammal and one reptile species are on the antagonistic side. The synthesis also revealed that most species can act as partial mutualists, even if they are typically considered antagonists. Our review demonstrates how different consumption behaviours and feeding types of vertebrate fruit consumers can influence seed dispersal and regeneration of palms, and thus ultimately affect the structure and functioning of tropical ecosystems. Variation in feeding types of animal consumers will influence ecosystem dynamics via effects on plant population dynamics and differences in long\u2010distance seed dispersal, and may subsequently affect ecosystem functions such as carbon storage.

In this respect, sorption enhanced water gas shift reaction process with in situ CO2 capture by solid sorbents represents an intensified option for producing a H2-rich product stream. In addition to enhanced H2 production, due to a shift in the key equilibrium reactions of gasification, this process has, in fact, several advantages including: a) the production of a concentrated stream of CO2, suitable for storage (sequestration), as a consequence of the reversibility that generally characterizes these processes.; b) the exothermic carbonation reaction can supply most of the heat demand of the endothermic gasification reactions; c) particles sorbents, such as limestone, dolomite, olivine and high-iron solids, show some catalytic activity for tar reforming and cracking.

These solvents typically have some benefits over traditional solvents such as aqueous monoethanolamine; for example, ionic liquids may have extremely small vapour pressures [1], and many new solvents require (in principle) much less energy for regeneration [6]. However these `advanced\u2019 solvents may also be viscous, volatile, corrosive, precipitating, or absorb carbon dioxide slowly, making them difficult to handle in practice. Microencapsulation of liquid solvents (MECS) has recently been proposed as a means of utilising such solvents in a practical way [7]. MECS are small (~200 micron) capsules with a polydimethylsiloxane (PMDS) shell and an interior containing the liquid solvent of interest. Due to their small size, MECS have 1-2 orders of magnitude greater surface area than a traditional packed column (substantially increasing mass transfer rates) while the isolation of the solvent from the environment potentially renders inconvenient physical properties of the solvent irrelevant. In principle, the MECS paradigm may reduce absorber volumes in a wide range of gas-separation operations. At present MECS are manufactured inside microfluidic devices at the rate of a few grams per hour, and the most significant challenge the technology faces is upscaling manufacture to the large (multi-tonne) scale required for industrial gas-separation. We propose an alternative material, with many of the desirable properties of MECS, but which can be manufactured via a scalable, one-pot method. Rather than creating capsules, we create a solventin-PDMS gel, which can be shaped into thin particles or sheets with very high surface areas. The gel is manufactured by first creating a concentrated solvent-in-PDMS emulsion, stabilised by suitable surfactants. In order to make particles, this emulsion is then dispersed as a double-emulsion in an aqueous solution of similar composition to the internal aqueous phase (to minimise loss of solvent), though small quantities of ethanol or Tween 20 may be added to the continuous phase to control the droplet size. Alternatively, the emulsion may spread as a thin film. Finally, the PDMS is cross-linked in situ with UV light, solidifying the gel. As PDMS has a very large CO2 permeability, gas flux into these materials is comparable with that into MECS particles, though they may prove simpler to manufacture at scale. Following Vericella et al. [7], gels materials were manufactured containing 50wt% of a potassium carbonate solution (3-30wt%) and 50wt% of a commercially available PDMS, Semicosil 949 UV. Mass transfer measurements were conducted, and were found to be in good agreement with a continuum model (Figure 1).

Furthermore, our design strategy provides a promising approach for the synthesis of other polymeric-based porous materials. In addition, we have investigated the thermodynamics of CO2 adsorption/desorption for a set of diamine functionalized SBA-15 sorbents under simulated flue gas conditions (0.15 bar CO2, 313 K). Enthalpies of CO2 adsorption (\u0394H\u00b0ads) of -21.7 and -21.0 kcal mol were obtained for primary diamine (1\u00b0-SBA) and secondary diamine (2\u00b0-SBA) functionalized material, respectively.

Introduction Global annual energy-related CO2 emissions reached a record high of 31.2 gigatonnes (Gt) in 2012[1], and are expected to rise continuously given the growing energy demands and widespread reliance on fossil fuel energy infrastructure. The mitigation of CO2 emission has been recognized as a crucial necessity, as CO2 is a major contributing greenhouse gas correlated to the negative effects of global warming, including sea level rise, significant variation in weather patterns, and threats to human health and wildlife habitats[2]. This has motivated research of post-combustion CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technologies, targeted at large point source emitters of CO2 such as coal fired power plants. Absorption with aqueous solutions of amines remains the benchmark approach at scale, but wide spread implementation is currently prohibited by the high energetic cost of sorbent regeneration, chiefly due to water vaporization. Translation of nitrogen based sorbents to porous solid supports is therefore an ongoing area of research. Background Carbon Capture The state-of-the-art technology for CO2 capture, aqueous amine scrubbing[3], has yet to be proven practical at scale due to considerable energy penalties of regeneration (ca. 50 kcal mol) [4], chiefly due to the vaporization of liquid water [5-8]. Solid-state postcombustion CO2 sorbents have certain advantages over traditional aqueous amine systems, such as relatively low regeneration energy requirements [8, 9], tunable pore morphology [10-13], and chemical variability through heteroatom doping or surface functionalization[14]. A variety of materials have been investigated for CO2 capture, including zeolites, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), porous carbons, porous silicas, and porous polymers[9, 15-20]. Nevertheless, it remains a significant challenge to achieve scalable sorbents that meet all of the requirements for CO2 capture, i.e., fast kinetics, high CO2 capacity and selectivity, mild regeneration conditions, and multicycle stability. For example, while chemisorbents like porous solid-supported amines may achieve excellent equilibrium adsorption capacities and CO2/N2 selectivities through chemical reactions with CO2[9, 21, 22], materials often require relatively high regeneration temperatures and long adsorption/desorption cycle times[9]. On the other hand, typical physisorbents, such as activated carbons and MOFs, can be regenerated with minimal energy input, yet have relatively low capacities under post-combustion conditions because of weak CO2-sorbent interactions and competing adsorption of other flue gas components, like N2 and H2O[8, 9] Nitrogen-Doped Porous Carbon Materials Ordered N-doped mesoporous carbons have attracted considerable attention in the application of CO2 capture owing to their high surface area, tunable pore structure, narrow pore size distribution, high N weight percentages, and mechanical, thermal, and electric properties. Typically, N-doped mesoporous carbons are prepared by a nanocasting method using a sacrificial template like porous silica. Nitrogen functionality can be incorporated by impregnation with nitrogen-containing organic molecules, followed by carbonization and removal of the silica template, or through post-synthesis treatment of mesoporous carbon using acetonitrile or ammonia chemical vapor deposition. These multiple-step processes are costly and time consuming. Other methods include the co-assembly of a nitrogen-containing monomer, melamine resin, urea-phenolformaldehyde resin, or dicyandiamide with a structural directing agent; however, the resulting porous polymers usually exhibit poor thermal stability. The decomposition process is further promoted by the high oxygen content within the triblock polymer. Development of reliable and facile strategies to synthesize N-doped mesoporous carbons without the use of a hard template is highly desirable. Carbons made by carbonization of polypyrrole possess graphitic structures and have high thermal conductivity that is desirable for heat transfer during adsorption and/or thermal regeneration. In this work, we report the successful synthesis of nitrogen-doped porous carbon using a modified-pyrrole monomer as the nitrogen source, which displays high CO2 capacity, high CO2/N2 selectivity, and facile regeneration. CO2 Sorption Thermodynamics A diverse range of solid CO2 sorbents have been studied, but emphasis is typically placed on maximizing the equilibrium CO2 capacities of materials. The thermodynamics of the adsorption/desorption process and, specifically, how the structure of sorbent molecules dictate the freeenergy of both CO2 adsorption and desorption reactions are not well understood. Mesoporous silicas are attractive solid supports due to their high surface areas, well-defined molecular-scale pore structures, and established synthetic and covalent modification procedures. By chemically altering the structure of amine sorbents and incorporating said sorbents onto the surface of ordered mesoporous silica, we have gained chemical level insights about the CO2 capture process and how amine structural perturbation effects the thermodynamics of the adsorption process (Scheme 1). Scheme 1. Changes to reaction free-energy with amine structural perturbation. Results Nitrogen-Doped Mesoporous Carbon A series of N-doped mesoporous activated carbons (SU-MAC-500, 600 and 800) have been synthesized, with surface areas ranging from 942 to 2369 m g, abundant ultrasmall microporosity (Figure 1), and various types of nitrogen functionalities (Figure 2). CO2 sorption capacity measurements were performed by pure gas adsorption, yielding values as high as 1.4 mmol g and 4.5 mmol g at 0.1 and 1 bar CO2, respectively (298 K) (Figure 3). More importantly, the N-doped carbons show unprecedented CO2/N2 selectivity of 331:1 at 298 K.

Harvested wood products (HWP) represent a common widespread and cost-efficient opportunity for negative emissions. After harvest, a significant fraction of the wood remains stored in HWPs for a period that can vary from some months to many decades, whereas atmospheric carbon (C) is immediately sequestered by vegetation re-growth. This temporal mismatch between oxidation of HWPs and C uptake by vegetation generates a net sink that lasts over time. The role of temporary carbon storage in forest products has been analysed and debated in the scientific literature, but detailed bottom-up studies mapping the fate of harvested materials and quantifying the associated emission profiles at national scales are rare. In this work, we quantify the net CO2 emissions and the temporary carbon storage in forest products in Norway, Sweden and Finland for the period 1960\u20132015, and investigate their correlation. We use a Chi square probability distribution to model the oxidation rate of C over time in HWPs, taking into consideration specific half-lives of each category of products. We model the forest regrowth and estimate the time-distributed C removal. We also integrate the specific HWP flows with an emission inventory database to quantify the associated life-cycle emissions of fossil CO2, CH4 and N2O.ResultsWe find that assuming an instantaneous oxidation of HWPs would overestimate emissions of about 1.18 billion t CO2 (cumulative values for the three countries over the period 1960\u20132015).We also find that about 40\u00a0years after 1960, the starting year of our analysis, are sufficient to detect signs of negative emissions. The total amount of net CO2 emissions achieved in 2015 are about \u2212\u20093.8 million t CO2, \u2212\u200927.9 t CO2 and \u2212\u200943.6 t CO2 in Norway, Sweden, and Finland, respectively.ConclusionWe argue for a more explicit accounting of the actual emission rates from HWPs in carbon balance studies and climate impact analysis of forestry systems and products, and a more transparent inclusion of the potential of HWP as negative emissions in perspective studies and scenarios. Simply assuming that all harvested carbon is instantaneously oxidized can lead to large biases and ultimately overlook the benefits of negative emissions of HWPs.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "e2dc3e2955ccf01f4665591053ce1123e126d882", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2400769675", "CorpusId": 113814662}, "title": "STATUS QUO FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CARBON CAPTURE, STORAGE AND UTILIZATION TECHNOLOGIES IN TAIWAN", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "1654692ee2d997af097eb12e7d888e2f8ea29879", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3125191369", "DOI": "10.48072/2525-7579.ROG.2020.556", "CorpusId": 234529085}, "title": "Normative scenarios for carbon dioxide capture, transport, use and storage in Brazil", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "31123e373204f047a9897d685cd239bf846a2be0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3009396510", "CorpusId": 226097579}, "title": "Hybrid Carbon-Metal Organic Frameworks for CO2 Capture and Natural Gas Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "b5ec7a9350650b32072e5bc5c09a7c6cf1a6d5a7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2327973952", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.201414311", "CorpusId": 130768814}, "title": "Thermal Modelling of Intermediate CO2 Storage in Crystalline Bedrock", "abstract": "Intermediate storage of CO2 is part of the Carbon Capture and Storage chain. Conventional choice for storage would be steel tanks above ground. Another option would be storing CO2 in underground caverns in crystalline bedrock. Storage of CO2 in caverns would be carried out in liquid form which requires low temperatures and high pressures (for example -40 centigrades and 10 bars respectively). Finite element modelling shows that storage of cold liquid CO2 in a rock cavern would induce a large heat flow from bedrock to the store and cause a significant thermal effect on the surroundings of the cavern. Storage would require constant cooling and it would be advantageous to cool the bedrock surrounding the store before actually storing CO2. Modelling indicates that the optimal store geometry minimizes the cavern wall surface area and that the optimal storage depth is neither too shallow nor too deep (between 50 and 200 metres). Furthermore, the temperatures of the surrounding bedrock would quickly drop below zero centigrades and the radius of the frozen zone around the store would extend to hundred metres after 100 years of storage.

The most major approach for carbon dioxide capture is the solvent absorption in which an aqueous solution of alkanoamine serving as an absorbent reacts chemically with mildly acidic carbon dioxide to form dissolved carbamates and bicarbonates. This process has been already in commercial use, however, it still has some drawbacks. Especially, it is a serious problem that the temperature swing required to regenerate the solvent leads to considerable energy consumption [1][2]. Hence, many studies have recently focused on the use of amino-functionalized mesoporous silicas as a solid adsorbent. These adsorbents possess the same chemical function at the surface of adsorbents as above-mentioned alkanoamine. That is, the anchored amine group on the mesoporous silicas forms a chemical bond with carbon dioxide, which plays an essential role for carbon dioxide capture. Nevertheless, its desorption is pressure dependent [1], meaning the pressure swing operation can also regenerate the used adsorbent [2]. This interesting nature provides a new possibility to overcome above-mentioned limitations of the solvent absorption using alkanoamine. However, it should be also noted that the heat of adsorption onto amine-functionalized mesoporous silicas is considerably large [1]. Moreover, the adsorption of carbon dioxide onto amino-functionalized mesoporous silca is significantly affected by the temperauture [1]. Hence, adsorption of carbon dioxide causes a significant temperature increase in the adsorption column, resulting in the lowerness of adsorption performance. Aiming at the control of adsorption and desorption heats, this study deals with synthesis and application of phase change material (PCM)/amino-functionalized mesoporous silica composite adsorbent. PCM is a substance with a high melting and solidifying enthalpy, and thus, in the composite adsorbent, it works as a heat storage during the occurrence of adsorption or desorption heat to prevent the temperature changes in the adsorption column. The synthesis strategy of the aforementioned composite adsorbent is based on the approach reported by Wesley et al.[3][4], which can easily synthesize the milimeter-to-centimeter sized spherical SBA-15 or SBA-16 using nonionic surfactant (Pluronic F-127) and low concentiration of acid in the presence of butanol. The SBA-15 particles with uniformly dispersed PCM could be obtained by adding the microencapsulated PCM at the proper step of this synthesis. The amount of PCM contained in the adsrobent could be controlled easily by tuning PCM microcapsule addition. The experimental results on the carbon dioxide adsorption demonstrated that the composite adsorbent was very effective in controlling the temperature changes of the adsorbent due to the adsorption or desorption heat; quasi-isothermal adsorption and desorption was realized.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "2d35d207ca5b86c958c481e23d3937041ffea263", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1837821693", "DBLP": "conf/icassp/LiuG01", "DOI": "10.1109/ICASSP.2001.941301", "CorpusId": 14427924}, "title": "Simultaneous image formation and motion blur restoration via multiple capture", "abstract": "Advances in CMOS image sensors enable fast image capture, which makes it possible to capture multiple images within a normal exposure time.

Many inorganic materials such as minerals [4, 5], incineration ash [6, 7], concrete [8, 9] and industrial residues [10, 11] are potentially huge sinks for anthropogenic CO2 emissions. These materials are typically abundant sources of alkaline and alkaline-earth metal oxides, which can react naturally with CO2 to form inorganic carbonates and bicarbonates. In addition, their products are thermodynamically stable and relatively inert at ambient conditions. On paper, MC should be able to fully sequester all anthropogenic CO2 emissions, since the abundance of magnesium and calcium atoms on Earth far exceeds the total amount of carbon atoms [12, 13]. However, despite the apparently favorable pre-conditions, we still observe a net accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere because the rates of reaction to form (bi)carbonates in nature are too slow compared to the current rate at which CO2 is being emitted [14, 15]. If left to their own devices, thousands of years are needed to achieve any substantial sequestration of CO2 [16]. This is clearly not rapid enough to solve the pressing problem of climate change that is already affecting us now. Therefore there is a need to employ mineral carbonation as an artificial method to accelerate the rates of CO2 sequestration. In this chapter, we will take a look into the chemistry and thermodynamics of mineral carbonation and discuss some of the main obstacles to large scale MC implementation. Additionally, we highlight the types of starting materials from which basic alkaline-earth metal oxides can be obtained and discuss how their abundance and properties affect MC performance. We will also give a short review of current research in the area to develop MC into viable and economic processes, with some focus on the main categories of process designs and their working principles. We will then look at MC from a techno-economic standpoint and assess the opportunities to integrate MC into the existing industrial and environmental landscape. Lastly, we conclude the chapter with a hypothetical scenario of MC deployment in Singapore, an economically developed but land-scarce country under threat by rising sea levels.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "619694a42fb4eff92a654d96a57d5b2adf8b1351", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1970615601", "DOI": "10.9713/KCER.2012.50.6.1008", "CorpusId": 93456826}, "title": "Characteristics of CO 2 Conversion Using Cobalt Ferrite Powders", "abstract": "The amount of domestic carbon dioxide emissions is more than 600 million tons/year.

A lot of researches on the conversion of captured carbon dioxide to useful carbon source have been conducted. The purpose of this study is to convert stable carbon dioxide to useful resources using less energy. For this purpose reducing gas and metallic oxide (activator) are required. Hydrogen was used as reducing gas and cobalt ferrite was used as activator. Considering that activator has different physical properties depending on synthesis methods, activator was prepared by hydrothermal synthesis and solid method. Decomposition characteristics of carbon dioxide were investigated using synthesized powders. Temperature programmed reduction/oxidation (TPR/TPO) and thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) device were used to observe the decomposition characteristics of carbon dioxide. Activator prepared by solid method with 5 and 10 wt% CoO content showed an excellent performance.

The purpose is to reduce the environmental pollutions and operating costs. The resilience and flexibility of the energy hub is also improved. Vehicle to grid and fully-partial charge models are incorporated for EVs to improve the system resilience and supplying the critical loads following events. Different events are modeled to evaluate the system resilience. The model is expressed as a stochastic mixed integer linear programming problem. Both active and reactive powers are modeled.

This technology alleviates the contradiction between power supply and demand due to the intermittent electricity production from environment-friendly renewable energy. Hydrogen (H2), produced by electrolysis, can be used to produce synthetic methane (CH4) by reacting with carbon dioxide (CO2) that is captured from carbon emission sources. Subsurface gas storage is one of the most important processes in a PtG system. However, nearly a half of the total stored gas is used as cushion gas to maintain a suitable reservoir pressure, indicating large amounts of CH4 might be wasted and trapped in geological formations. Based on a PtG system, CO2 can be a promising choice as a cushion gas due to its high effective compressibility near its critical conditions. In this paper, a numerical model is established based on the theory of the fluid flow and molecular diffusion to study the role of CO2 as a cushion gas in increasing the gas storage capacity. The accuracy of this model is verified by comparing with that of Curtis M. Oldenburg. However, because of the declining purity of recovered gas induced by the convection and diffusion of two kinds of gases in the same reservoir. The influences of reservoir thickness on the distribution of mixed region are discussed. The results show that thicker reservoir would be a better choice for the geological storage of CH4 with CO2 as a cushion gas.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "a22302f2193508df2331a1dede8aa944d3e0e7ad", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2976578601", "DOI": "10.1002/bit.27175", "CorpusId": 202732971, "PubMed": "31544961"}, "title": "Engineering the genetic components of a whole\u2010cell catalyst for improved enzymatic CO2 capture and utilization", "abstract": "Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is a diffusion\u2010limited enzyme that rapidly catalyzes the hydration of carbon dioxide (CO2).

Many groups around the globe intensively develop new greenhouse gas scavengers. Room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) are seen as a proper starting point to synthesize more environmentally friendly and high-performance sorbents. Aprotic heterocyclic anions (AHA) represent excellent agents for carbon capture and storage technologies. In the present work, we investigate RTILs in which both the weakly coordinating cation and AHA bind CO2. The ammonium-, phosphonium-, and sulfonium-based 2-cyanopyrrolidines were investigated using the state-of-the-art method to describe the thermochemistry of the CO2 fixation reactions. The infrared spectra and electronic and structural properties were simulated at the hybrid density functional level of theory to characterize the reactants and products of the chemisorption reactions. We conclude that the proposed CO2 capturing mechanism is thermodynamically allowed and discuss the difference between different families of RTILs. Quite unusually, the intramolecular electrostatic attraction plays an essential role in stabilizing the zwitterionic products of the CO2 chemisorption. The difference in chemisorption performance between the families of RTILs is linked to sterical hindrances and nucleophilicities of the \u03b1- and \u03b2-carbon atoms of the aprotic cations.

But at the same time, concerns over the potential for dangerous climate change to be caused by carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from many human activities, including power generation using coal, has led to global efforts to identify technologies that can reduce CO 2 emissions. For coal-fired power plants, it is likely that successful development and deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies will be the only way that their continued operation will be allowed, in order to avoid unacceptable environmental impacts. This chapter reviews the key carbon capture technologies closest to commercial deployment at coal-fired power plants. It identifies similarities and differences between options that should be taken into account when investment decisions are made, with a particular focus on operating characteristics. It is very likely that regulation, including on acceptable CO 2 emissions, will play a critical role in determining the landscape for power plant investment, so a discussion of some key regulatory issues in determining if, when and where CCS is introduced is also included.", "year": 2009}]}
