The main cause is anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases, the principal one being carbon dioxide, released in the atmosphere as a by-product of the combustion of hydrocarbons for the generation of energy. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technology that would prevent carbon dioxide from being emitted into the atmosphere by safely sequestering it underground. For so doing, CO2 must be captured at large emission points and transported at high pressure to underground reservoirs, where the gas can be injected and stored for thousands of years to come. During surface transportation, leakages from high pressure facilities would pose a risk to the general public, for carbon dioxide is toxic at high concentrations. \n\nIn this study, atmospheric dispersion of carbon dioxide is studied by the usage of software that solves mathematical equations and algorithms simulating the pollutant dispersion. Dispersion models are used to estimate or predict downwind distances covered by toxic concentrations of the pollutant, emitted from sources such as high-pressure transportation facilities within CCS projects. Two modelling tools from two different classes (Gaussian ALOHA 5.4 and Computational Fluid Dynamics PANACHE 3.4.1) have been evaluated against release field experiments using the statistical model evaluation method proposed by Hanna et al. (1993,2004) and Hanna and Chang (2001), and applied for the consideration of the dense gas CO2, released in large amounts due to leakages.\n\nPredictions from the two models have been compared and the limitations of both examined, when dealing with a gas that presents the distinctive physical characteristics of carbon dioxide. The models have been used and compared in simulating representative failure cases within CCS transportation with release parameters taken from the literature. The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model showed a much higher precision when describing the release of the gas from a HP facility, mainly when dealing with the jet release caused by leakages of any dimensions. \n\nWhen dealing with the transportation of toxic gases, the magnitude of hazards posed by potential failure events within the transportation system is proportional to the extent of the area covered by toxic concentrations of the gas, when modelling representative leakages. Results of this investigation depict a lowering of the Risk involved in the transportation of CO2 by up to an order of magnitude, when modelling the same releases with CFD tools, instead of the more common Gaussian models. \n\nThe European Union recognizes that deployment of CCS for hydrocarbon power generation, in parallel with the production of renewable energies, is the only way to meet the target for temperature stabilization. For its Impact Assessment on CCS, the EU used results from a risk assessment compiled after the utilization of a Gaussian model. In this thesis, a criticism of this choice is put forward, considering that, when introducing the technology to the general public and regional scale administrators, a Risk Assessment derived using results from Gaussian models can over-estimate the risk in a way not favourable to the purpose.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "9b0b0b636f35df542e3b27b151e2aa9016d3bee8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2913654249", "DOI": "10.3390/APP9040645", "CorpusId": 115453711}, "title": "Soil-Gas Concentrations and Flux Monitoring at the Lacq-Rousse CO2-Geological Storage Pilot Site (French Pyrenean Foreland): From Pre-Injection to Post-Injection", "abstract": "Soil-gas concentrations and flux were measured during 20 separate measurement campaigns at the TOTAL Lacq-Rousse carbon capture and storage (CCS) pilot site, southern France, where 51,000 tons of CO2 were injected in a depleted natural gas field.

The application of the work is for carbon dioxide (CO2) storage in aquifers, where capillary trapping is a rapid and effective mechanism to render the injected fluid immobile: the CO2 is injected into the formation followed by chase brine injection or natural groundwater flow that displaces and traps it. Current models to predict the amount of trapping are based on experiments in consolidated media; while CO2 is likely to be injected at depths greater than around 800 m to render it super-critical, it may be injected into formations that tend to have a higher porosity and permeability than deep oilfield rocks. We use analogue fluids \u2013 water and refined oil \u2013 at ambient conditions. The initial conditions are established by injecting oil into vertical or horizontal sand packs 1 m long at different flow rates and then allowing the oil to migrate due to buoyancy forces. The packs are then flooded with water. The columns are sliced and the residual saturation measured with great accuracy and sensitivity by gas chromatography. This method allows low saturations to be measured reliably. The trapped saturation initially rises linearly with initial saturation to a value of around 0.11, followed by a constant residual as the initial saturation increases further. This behavior is not predicted by the traditional Land (1968) model, but is physically consistent with poorly consolidated media where most of the larger pores can easily be invaded at relatively low saturation and there is, overall, relatively little trapping. The best match to our experimental data was achieved with the Aissaoui (1983) trapping model. Introduction If we are to avoid potentially dangerous climate change, we need to capture and store CO2 emitted by fossil-fuel burning power stations and other industrial plants (Orr, 2004). Saline aquifers provide the largest potential for storage and the widest geographical spread (Hawkes et al., 2005). Subsequent leakage of CO2 into the atmosphere, even over hundreds of years, would render any sequestration scheme inefficient. However, based on the experience of the oil and gas industry, there is a good understanding of trapping mechanisms that take place in geological formations. Hydrodynamic trapping is the primary mechanism by which hydrocarbons accumulate in the subsurface. The same mechanism would take place during carbon sequestration, with the less dense CO2 rising due to buoyancy forces until it is trapped under impermeable cap-rock (Bachu et al., 1994). However, this process relies on there being an intact barrier to upwards flow. Solution trapping occurs when there is dissolution of CO2 in the aquifer brine. The CO2 saturated brine is denser than the surrounding brine leading to convective mixing where the denser brine migrates deeper into the formation (Lindeberg and Wessel-Berg, 1997; Riaz et al., 2006; Ennis-King and Paterson, 2005). Mineral trapping occurs over longer timescales than other trapping methods. As CO2 dissolves in formation brine carbonic acid is formed (H2CO3) which dissociates and can subsequently react with the host rock or brine to generate solid minerals over periods of thousands to billions of years (Gunter and Perkins, 1993; Gunter et al., 1997; Egermann et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2008). The final trapping mechanism involves CO2 becoming immobile at the pore scale by capillary forces. This process occurs as the CO2 migrates upwards, when it is displaced by natural groundwater flow or by the injection of chase brine. It is a rapid and effective trapping mechanism that reduces the need to ensure cap-rock integrity (Kumar et al., 2005; Hesse et al., 2006; Obi and Blunt, 2006; Juanes et al., 2006; Qi et al., 2007; Saadatpoor et al., 2008).", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "617df321f11045b57a1b3c898e23d7734fab0550", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2745054917", "DOI": "10.1093/femsle/fnx166", "CorpusId": 650023, "PubMed": "28934379"}, "title": "Autotrophic biorefinery: dawn of the gaseous carbon feedstock.", "abstract": "CO2 is a resource yet to be effectively utilized in the autotrophic biotechnology, not only to mitigate and moderate the anthropogenic influence on our climate, but also to steer CO2 sequestration for sustainable development and carbon neutral status.

This causes a change in the atmosphere composition and the problem of global warming. The desire to alleviate the global warming problem has resulted in a serious environmental concern and a need to either reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial sources or put them into long term storage. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the largest contributor to the global warming problem, and is thus the major target for the reduction. Among the capture techniques, the flue gas scrubbing using absorption solvents is the most mature and readily applied technology for the reduction of CO2 emissions from the stationary power plants. 2 Aqueous solutions of alkanolamines are the chemical solvents that have been used extensively for the CO2 capture. 3 Common alkanolamines are monoethanolamine (MEA), diglycolamine (DGA), diethanolamine (DEA), diisopropanolamine (DIPA) and methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). At present, formulated solutions containing a variety of alkanolamines are gaining popularity in the gas separation industry. These solutions often provide a greater absorption performance or meet unique needs when compared to the aqueous solutions of single alkanolamines. The most common formulations consist of blends of MDEA and other alkanolamines to form MDEA-based solvents.

For the NGCC+PCC examples shown in this paper, moving from 'first of a kind' (FOAK) to 'nth of a kind' (NOAK) gives significant improvements through both reduced financing costs and capital cost reductions. To achieve this the main emphasis needs to be on 'commercial readiness', rather than on system-level 'technical readiness', and on improvements through innovation activities, supported by underpinning research, that develop novel sub-processes; this will also maintain NOAK status for cost-effective financing.

A recent evaluation of the global potential of primary renewable energy carried out by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) sets a value of at least 2800EJ/yr, which is more than the most energy-intensive SRES scenario forecast for the world energy requirement up to the year 2100. Nevertheless, what is really important to quantify is the amount of final energy since the use of renewable sources may involve conversion efficiencies, from primary to final energy, different from the ones of conventional energy sources. In reality, IPCC does not provide a complete account of the final energy from renewables, but the text claims that using several available options to mitigate climate change, and renewables is only one of them, it is possible to stabilize atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration at a low level. In this paper, we evaluate in detail biomass primary and final energy using sugarcane crop as a proxy, since it is one of the highest energy density forms of biomass, and through afforestation/reforestation using a model presented in IPCC Second Assessment Report (SAR). The conclusion is that the primary-energy potential for biomass has been under-evaluated by many authors and by IPCC, and this under-evaluation is even larger for final energy since sugarcane allows co-production of electricity and liquid fuel. Regarding forests we reproduce IPCC results for primary energy and calculate final energy. Sugarcane is a tropical crop and cannot be grown in all the land area forecasted for biomass energy plantation in the IPCC/TAR evaluation (i.e. 1280Mha). Nevertheless, there are large expanses of unexploited land, mainly in Latin America and Africa that are subject to warm weather and convenient rainfall. With the use of 143Mha of these lands it is possible to produce 164EJ/yr (1147GJ/hayr or 3.6W/m2on average) of primary energy and 90EJ/yr of final energy in the form of liquid fuel (alcohol) and electricity, using agricultural productivities near the best ones already achievable and biomass gasification technology. More remarkable is that these results can be obtained with the operation of 4,000 production units with unitary capacity similar to the largest currently in operation. These units should be spread over the tropical land area yielding a plantation density similar to the one presently observed in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, where alcohol and electricity have been commercialized in a cost-effective way for several years. Such an amount of final energy would be sufficiently large to fulfill all the expected global increase in oil demand, as well as in electricity consumption by 2030, assuming the energy demand of such sources continues to grow at the same pace observed over the last two decades. When sugarcane crops are combined with afforestation/reforestation it is possible to show that carbon emissions decline for some IPCC SRES scenarios by 2030, 2040 and 2050.

From about 280 ppm before the start of this period in history, these values have increased to about 379 ppm in 2005, which is by far higher than the natural range of CO2 determined from ice cores over the last 650,000 years (IPCC 2007). The primary source of this increase is the use of carbon-rich fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production. It is widely accepted today that these changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations are a major contributor to global warming by trapping heat radiating from the earth\u2019s surface, by the so-called greenhouse effect (NAP 2001; IPCC 2007). Several technological options have been proposed to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of CO2 (Pacala and Socolow 2004). One suggested remedy is to separate and capture CO2 from power plants burning fossil fuels and from other stationary industrial sources and to inject the produced CO2 into deep subsurface formations for longterm storage and sequestration (IPCC 2005). The most promising targets for geologic sequestration of the CO2 would be deep saline formations as well as depleted or near-depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Saline formations offer the largest CO2 storage capacity and are widely distributed worldwide. Hydrocarbon reservoirs, on the other hand, are not so common, but have the advantage of having caprocks with proven \u2018\u2018sealing\u2019\u2019 capacity (buoyant fluids remained trapped in place over geologic times), and the injected CO2 may enhance oil or gas production. The scale at which CO2 would have to be sequestered is large. Considering Norway\u2019s North Sea Sleipner project, which is the world\u2019s first industrial-scale CO2 geologic storage operation with an annual injection of about one million tonnes of CO2 since 1996 (e.g., Torp and Gale 2003), Pacala and Socolow (2004) estimate that 3,500 Sleipner-sized capture and storage (CCS) projects, would be needed worldwide over the next 50 years to help stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations. While geologic sequestration is a promising method for CO2 mitigation, continued research and development efforts are important to advance the state of the art in many areas so that CCS can be effectively and safely deployed on a global scale (e.g., Litynsky et al. 2006). One challenging research area is the optimization of the methodology to assess the suitability of potential geologic sequestration sites. Careful site characterization is necessary to demonstrate that storage in geologic formations is both feasible, i.e., that the formations have a large enough storage capacity and good injectivity, and effective, i.e., that the formations provide safe long-term containment, without adverse impacts to human health or the environment (Bachu 2000). The importance and objective of site characterization are reiterated in the special report on carbon dioxide capture and storage issued by the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC 2005), which stated that \u2018\u2018site characterization, selection and performance prediction are crucial for successful geological storage. Before selecting a site, the geological setting must be characterized to determine if the overlying cap rock will provide an J. Birkholzer (&) C.-F.

Formaldehyde is one of the major indoor gaseous pollutants. Depending on its concentration, formaldehyde may cause minor disorder symptoms to a serious injury. Some of the successful applications of technology for the removal of formaldehyde have been reported. However, this paper presents an overview of several studies on the elimination of formaldehyde that has been done by adsorption method because of its simplicity. The adsorption method does not require high energy and the adsorbent used can be obtained from inexpensive materials. Most researchers used activated carbon as an adsorbent for removal of formaldehyde because of its high adsorption capacity. Activated carbons can be produced from many materials such as coals, woods, or agricultural waste. Some of them were prepared by specific activation methods to improve the surface area. Some researchers also used modified activated carbon by adding specific additive to improve its performance in attracting formaldehyde molecules. Proposed modification methods on activation and additive impregnated carbon are thus discussed in this paper for future development and improvement of formaldehyde adsorption on activated carbon. Specifically, a waste agricultural product is chosen for activated carbon raw material because it is renewable and gives an added value to the materials. The study indicates that the performance of the adsorption of formaldehyde might be improved by using modified activated carbon. Bamboo seems to be the most appropriate raw materials to produce activated carbon combined with applying chemical activation method and addition of metal oxidative catalysts such as Cu or Ag in nano size particles. Bamboo activated carbon can be developed in addition to the capture of formaldehyde as well as the storage of adsorptive hydrogen gas that supports renewable energy.

Borealis site in Stenungsund is involved in an initiative that aims to reduce the CO2 emissions in the Skagerrak region with CCS technology. A post combustion carbon capture process with mono-ethanolamine (MEA) absorption is evaluated to separate CO2 from flue gases generated in Borealis\u2019 cracker plant.\nThe post combustion process was simulated in Aspen Plus to find the optimal operating conditions. The post combustion process is very energy demanding. To reduce the energy demand process integration possibilities with the cracker plant were investigated with help of pinch analysis. Utilizing excess heat from the carbon capture process showed substantial heat savings potentials. It was also shown that the heat saved could be used in the post combustion process. 40 MW heat representing 64 % of the carbon capture process heating demand could be saved by process integration and optimization.\nA study by Tel-Tek investigated the implementation of the post combustion process without process integration. In order to meet the heating demand of the process a steam boiler was proposed to supply the heat. This thesis shows that investment of a steam boiler can be avoided thanks to process integration.

We use an integrated assessment model of energy and agriculture systems to show that, given a climate policy in which terrestrial carbon is appropriately valued equally with carbon emitted from the energy system, biomass energy has the potential to be a major component of achieving these low concentration targets. The costs of processing and transporting biomass energy at much larger scales than current experience are also incorporated into the modeling. From the scenario results, 120-160 EJ/year of biomass energy is produced by midcentury and 200-250 EJ/year by the end of this century. In the first half of the century, much of this biomass is from agricultural and forest residues, but after 2050 dedicated cellulosic biomass crops become the dominant source. A key finding of this paper is the role that carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies coupled with commercial biomass energy can play in meeting stringent emissions targets. Despite the higher technology costs of CCS, the resulting negative emissions used in combination with biomass are a very important tool inmore\u00a0\u00bb controlling the cost of meeting a target, offsetting the venting of CO2 from sectors of the energy system that may be more expensive to mitigate, such as oil use in transportation.

This article provides an overview of the issues and the process for risk management.

This storage potential is confined to sedimentary rocks, which have substantial porosity and high permeability in comparison to crystalline igneous and metamorphic rocks. These in turn occur in the sedimentary basins of the Earth's continents and near shore. However, the specific capacity for storage is not correlated simply to the existence of a basin. Consideration must also be made of reservoir permeability, caprock integrity, injectivity, fluid dynamics, and geomechanical properties of pressurisation and faulting. These are the topics addressed in this chapter. These processes and properties will combine in complex ways in a wide range of settings to govern the practicality of storing large volumes of CO2. There is clear potential for storage at the scale required to mitigate the worst impacts of global climate change, estimated to be in the order of 10 Gt CO2 per year by 2050.

Under a near-term scenario using up to 206 million tonnes per year of biomass, up to 181 million tonnes CO2 can be sequestered annually at scenario-average costs ranging from $62 to $137 per tonne CO2; under a long-term scenario using up to 740 million tonnes per year of biomass, up to 737 million tonnes CO2 can be sequestered annually at scenario-average costs ranging from $42 to $92 per tonne CO2.

We sampled meadows from five locations that differed in seagrass and environmental characteristics. Established meadows of the invasive seagrass Halophila stipulacea were also present at two of these locations, and we measured ecosystem metabolism in these meadows for comparison to grazed and ungrazed areas of the native T. testudinum.

Introduction Fossil fuels are projected to be the primary source of energy for the United States and most developed and developing countries over the next several decades, and their consumption is expected to increase. Atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) have risen significantly from preindustrial levels of 280 parts per million (ppm) to present levels of around 384 ppm (Tans, 2008). Evidence suggests that the observed rise in atmospheric CO2 levels is the result of expanded use of fossil fuels for energy. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is expected to rise due to the anticipated increase in fossil fuel usage unless major advances in energy management and production are made (Socolow et al., 2004; Greenblatt and Sarmiento, 2004). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an emerging strategy for preventing the emission of anthropogenic CO2 into the atmosphere. The long-term storage of anthropogenic CO2 is a promising technology for slowing, and ultimately reversing, the build-up of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the atmosphere (NETL, 2009). The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is the lead federal agency for the research, development, demonstration, and deployment (RDD&D) of carbon sequestration technologies.

On the other hand, cucurbit[n]urils (Q[n]s), a relatively new class of macrocyclic hosts with a rigid hydrophobic cavity and two identical carbonyl fringed portals, have attracted much attention in supramolecular chemistry. Because of the strong charge-dipole and hydrogen bonding interactions, as well as hydrophobic and hydrophilic effect derived from the negative portals and rigid cavities of Q[n]s, nearly all research in Q[n]s has been focused on utilizing the portals and cavities to construct supramolecular assemblies similar to other macrocyclic receptors such as cyclodextrin and calixarenes. Interestingly, a recent study revealed that other weak noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and \u03c0\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 stacking, as well as C-H\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7\u03c0 and ion-dipole interactions, could also be defined as \"outer-surface interactions\", which are derived from the electrostatically positive outer surface of Q[n]s. These interactions could be the driving forces in the formation of various novel Q[n]-based supramolecular architectures and functional materials. In this Account, we provide a comprehensive overview of supramolecular self-assemblies based on the outer-surface interactions of Q[n]s.

Pioneering work has shown that such weak noncovalent interactions play very important roles in the formation of various Q[n]-based functional materials and supramolecular architectures. For example, hydrogen bonds in outer-surface interactions between Q[n] molecules not only function as the sole driving force in the formation of one-dimensional Q[n] porous channels but also assist the bonding forces of the channels in capturing and accommodating acetylene molecules and carbon dioxide in the channel cavities. Moreover, upon introduction of a third species such as an aromatic molecule or inorganic anion into the Q[n]/metal system, \"outer-surface interactions\" could lead to Q[n]/metal-based self-assemblies from simple finite supramolecular coordination complexes to infinite polydimensional supramolecular architectures and other structures.

In this context, biomass upgrading technologies such as torrefaction and hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), which increase the energy density and improve the storability and handling of the biomass, have recently gained attention. This work provides a techno-economic assessment of commercial-scale HTC plants and their competing technologies. In the first part of this work, energetic efficiency, GHG emissions and costs of HTC are compared to those of wood pelletizing, torrefaction and anaerobic digestion. Moreover, the substitution of fossil fuels by the aforementioned biofuels in existing power stations is analyzed. The second part focusses on the potential role of biomass upgrading technologies for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Torrefaction and HTC cause the biomass to lose its fibrous structure, thus facilitating entrained flow gasification. In order to investigate the merits of this conversion pathway, torrefaction or HTC followed by entrained flow gasification is compared to the direct fluidized bed gasification of raw wood. The analysis is based on flowsheet simulations created with Aspen Plus. Exergy analysis is employed to locate thermodynamic losses within the respective processes. Exergoeconomic analysis is applied to the HTC plant design to reveal potentials for reducing the biocoal production costs. A simple model of the entire supply chain is developed in order to assess the costs and GHG emissions related to biomass and biofuel transport and storage and their dependency on the plant capacity. The results indicate that HTC can only be economically competitive with conventional wood pelletizing if waste biomass is used as a feedstock. Depending on the remuneration for waste disposal, relatively large processing capacities of up to 100 kt/a of feedstock are required year-round to make HTC an economically viable proposition. Potential feedstocks include park and gardening waste and empty fruit bunches from palm oil production. Exergy analysis reveals that drying of the feedstock or biofuel is the most significant source of exergy destruction in all the analyzed processes generating solid biofuels. HTC and anaerobic digestion also suffer large exergy losses through their waste streams. Measures to improve the efficiency and cost of HTC include efficient heat recovery, drying in superheated steam, and using the waste water to produce biogas. Integration of HTC with a rankine-cycle CHP plant may reduce the biocoal production cost and increase operability by omitting the complex heat recovery scheme required for a standalone HTC plant. IGCC power plants with carbon capture are more efficient when employing entrained flow gasification fired on torrefied wood or HTC biocoal than when using fluidized bed gasification of raw wood. However, the higher efficiency of the IGCC cannot compensate for the conversion losses of the biomass upgrading. Moreover, the carbon capture rate for scenarios with biomass upgrading is only 66\u201369%, compared to 82\u201386% for the direct fluidized bed gasification of the raw biomass. The unit cost of electricity generated by the BECCS plants is strongly dependent on the CO2 price.

Ideally, the CO2 will be safely transported to sequestration sites and injected deep underground, where it will be permanently trapped, with no negative impact on the terrestrial environment or on underground resources such as groundwater or fossil fuel deposits. In practice, carbon sequestration will be neither perfectly effective nor risk-free. There are risks associated with geologic carbon sequestration, and evaluation of these risks will be important for making decisions concerning where and how sequestration should be performed. The goal of a risk assessment is to quantify the likelihood of harm (or loss) and to present the results in a format that assists decision makers who must act to tolerate, mitigate, or eliminate the potential harm. The goal of risk management is to establish the practical significance of the assessed risks, compare the costs of reducing these risk to benefits gained, compare the risks to the societal benefits derived from incurring the risk, and to establish political and institutional processes of reducing risks. This section summarizes the risk assessment approaches and risk management methods that can be applied to study geologic carbon sequestration in California, including CO2 capture, transportation and storage operations.

In this work, lithium orthosilicate (Li4SiO4) was studied as a carbon dioxide sorbent. For a deeper understanding of the synthesis and carbonation mechanism of Li4SiO4, an in situ synchrotron radiation powder X-ray diffraction technique was used. The Li4SiO4 powders were synthesized by a combination of ball milling of a Li2CO3 and SiO2 mixture followed by a thermal treatment process at low temperature. In situ studies showed that formation of Li4SiO4 from the as-milled 2Li2CO3-SiO2 mixture involves decomposition of Li2CO3 by reaction with SiO2via Li2SiO3 as an intermediate compound. No evidence of Li2Si2O5 formation was obtained, in spite of thermodynamic predictions. The CO2 capture by Li4SiO4 was evaluated dynamically over a wide temperature range, reaching a maximum weight increase of 34 wt% and good cyclability after about 10 cycles. By thermogravimetric and microstructural analyses in combination with ex situ and in situ measurements, a two step carbonation mechanism and its influence on the final CO2 capture was clearly elucidated. Under dynamical conditions up to 700 \u00b0C, the lower number of Li2CO3 nuclei initially formed retards the double shell formation and the nucleation and growth of the Li2CO3 particles remains the controlling step up to higher CO2 capture capacity. Isothermal carbonation at 700 \u00b0C favours the formation of a higher number of Li2CO3 nuclei that creates a thin carbonate shell. The CO2 diffusion through this shell is the limiting step from the beginning and further carbonation is hindered as the reaction progresses.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "4f2c12470b729027b7999706c15f5e11bfb6fa4b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2323327953", "DOI": "10.4135/9781446247501.n544", "CorpusId": 137775531}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)", "abstract": "Im 4.

However, as recognised primarily by Finnish pulp and paper industry and metal industries, Finland can make use of its significant resources of magnesium silicates and industrial wastes. Finland's CO2 emissions in excess of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol commitments are currently 10 - 15 Mt/a (megatons). The carbonation of Finnish magnesium (Mg) silicate resources appears to offer enough capacity for storing at least several Gt (gigatons) CO2, forming a benign carbonate product that doesn't require post-storage monitoring of the CO2. Besides this, the carbonation of slag by-products from iron- and steelmaking allows for producing many kt (kilotons) of valuable precipitated calcium (Ca) carbonate (PCC) products with applications in paper-making, or for flue gas desulphurisation.

Even more significant savings can be attained on the supply side if fuel switching and CO2 capture and storage are considered. However, such changes must start in the coming decade to have a substantial impact by 2050. Introduction Rising population and increasing wealth are fueling grow- ing global demand for products, services, buildings, and public infrastructure. The industrial sector, which manufactures these products and structures, has many opportunities to make them using less energy and emitting less carbon dioxide (CO2). This article discusses these opportunities, highlighting those in the materials industries and those depending on advances in mate- rials science, engineering, and management. Industry also has a role in developing, producing, using, and recycling improved materials (e.g., stronger, lighter weight, and better insulating) to manufacture products that consume less energy when used, but with some exceptions, these issues and the full lifecycle energy and emissions consequences thereof are beyond the scope of this article and are addressed elsewhere in this issue. In 2004, the total global primary energy supply was 469 exajoules (EJ). Industry, when apportioned the energy losses from the electricity and heat it uses, accounted for more than 147 EJ, or nearly one-third of this supply. Total final energy use (excluding electricity and heat losses) by industry amounted to 113 EJ (Table I). These totals exclude energy used for the trans- portation of raw materials and finished industrial products, which is not negligible. The mentioned quantities include oil feedstocks for the production of synthetic organic products. Most industrial energy consumption occurs in industries that produce raw materials: chemicals and petrochemicals, iron and steel, nonmetallic minerals, and nonferrous metals.

By trapping and locking away OC over geological timescales, fjord sediments provide a potentially important yet largely overlooked climate regulation service. Currently, our understanding of the spatial distribution of OC within the surficial sediments of fjords is limited and this potentially implies an overestimation in the global estimates of OC buried in fjords as current calculation methods assume a homogeneous seabed. Using the mid-latitude fjords of Scotland and Ireland as a natural laboratory, we have developed a multi-tiered methodological approach utilizing a spectrum of data ranging from freely available chart data to the latest multibeam geophysics to determine and map the seabed sediment type. Targeted sampling of fjord sediments was undertaken to establish a calibration of sediment type against OC content. The results show that fjord sediments are highly heterogeneous both in sediment type and OC content. Utilizing the tiered mapping outputs, first order estimates of the surficial (top 10 cm) sediment OC stock within Scottish fjords (4.16 \u00b1 0.5 Mt OC) and Irish systems (2.09 \u00b1 0.26 Mt OC), when normalized for area the surficial sediments of Scottish and Irish fjords hold 2027 \u00b1 367 and 1844 \u00b1 94 respectively far exceed estimates for the continental shelf, again highlighting fjord sediments as hotspots for the capture of OC. This tiered approach to mapping sediment type is ideally suited to areas of the marine environment where data availability and quality is a limiting issue.

Moreover, coreflooding experiments were carried out to evaluate the incremental oil recovery obtained by carbonated brine injection. Finally, nonreactive tracer tests and micro computed tomography were used to observe the effects of mineral dissolution on the sweeping efficiency. Carbonated brine induced a decreased oil-wet behavior caused by rock dissolution and desorption of organic compounds resulting in a contact angle reduction of 55\u00b0 for the Pre-Salt rock. This contributed to obtain a 27% increase in oil recovery. Moreover, tracer tests and micro computed tomography verified the formation of preferential flow paths by mineral dissolution.

Employing vegetation as a carbon capture and storage system encapsulates a soft-engineering strategy that can be easily deployed by planners and environmental managers. In this review, urban agriculture is presented as a land-use solution to counteract the effects of urbanization, and as a means to establish a continuum between cities and the countryside. It espouses the usefulness of urban agriculture to enhance food security while sequestering carbon. As part of urban greening (including newer approaches, such as green roofs and gardens as well as more established forms of greening, such as forests and parks), urban agriculture offers traditionally rural services in cities, thereby contributing to food resources as well as working to alleviate pressing social issues like poverty. It also provides a way to reduce stress on farmland, and creates opportunities for employment and community-building. As part of greening, urban agriculture provides a buffer for pollution and improves environmental (and well as human) health and well-being.

Despite the intensity of soil disturbance in annual vegetable and \ufb02ower beds, the highest endogeic earthworm biomass and diversity were found in those habitats.

Our goal is to determine factors that might help build awareness and knowledge of CCS so that citizens can make informed decisions about it. Specifically, we focus on perceived risks, benefits and emotions associated with CCS and intentions to seek information about it. We surveyed 970 adults from a region of Texas that has seen recent growth in the application of CCS technology. Consistent with prior research, most respondents were not aware of CCS or the risks and benefits associated with it. To explore CCS-related information -seeking intent, we sought guidance from the planned risk information -seeking model, which identifies factors that contribute to intentions to seek information about risk-related topics. The majority of the hypothesized relationships were supported, and the model accounted for 48% of the variance in intent to seek information about CCS risks and benefits. Furthermore, perceived benefits and hope played significant roles in explaining information-seeking intent.

A classification scheme is described and a diagram is proposed to display the full range of both fresh and altered ultramafic rock compositions. This is particularly for the benefit of technologists to raise the awareness of the variation in possible feedstock materials. A systematic set of acid leaching experiments, in the presence of recyclable ammonium bisulphate, has been carried out covering the range of ultramafic rock compositions. The results show that lizardite serpentinite releases the most Mg with 78% removed after 1 h, while an olivine rock (dunite) gave 55% and serpentinized peridotites intermediate values.

In recent years, several theoretical and experimental studies in this field have been oriented toward capturing CO2 from IGCCs through the integration of solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) for coal-syngas oxidation, investigating the so-called integrated gasification fuel cell cycles (IGFC). However, molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) can also be a promising technology in IGFCs. After rather comprehensive research carried out by the authors on modeling and simulation of SOFC-based IGFC plants, an interesting IGFC cycle based on MCFC is assessed in this work, where plant layout is designed to exploit the capability of MCFCs of transferring CO2 and O2 from the oxidant side to the fuel side. Syngas produced in a high efficiency Shell gasifier is cleaned and mainly burned in a combustion turbine as in conventional IGCCs. Turbine flue gas, rich with oxygen and carbon dioxide, are then used as oxidant stream for the fuel cell at the cathode side, while the remaining clean syngas is oxidized at the anode side. In this way, the MCFC, while efficiently producing electricity, separates CO2 from the gas turbine flue gas as in a post-combustion configuration; oxygen is also transported toward the anode side, oxidizing the remaining syngas as in an oxy-combustion mode. A CO2 -rich stream is hence obtained at anode outlet, which can be cooled and compressed for long term storage. This configuration allows production of power from coal with high efficiency and low emission. In addition, as already highlighted in a previous study where a similar concept has been applied to natural gas-fired combined cycles, a limited fraction of the power output is generated by the fuel cell (the most expensive component), highlighting its potential also from an economic point of view.

We focused on monitoring environmental influences on shallow seismic velocity, which are unrelated to CO2 injection into deep reservoirs. A continuous, controlled seismic source system called Accurately Controlled Routinely Operated Signal System was used to enhance the temporal resolution and source repeatability. Observed phase velocities were clearly higher in winter than in warmer seasons. The seasonal variation could be reproduced by an increase in the shallow S wave velocity during winter associated with the greater extent of freezing of partially saturated rock. We also observed gradual increases or decreases in phase velocities as the seasons changed, which could be related to gradual freezing or melting of ice. Our monitoring system thus could be effective for monitoring temporal variations of the shallow subsurface associated with the degree of freezing.

This sinking is sensitive to changes in surface buoyancy, in particular because of freshening since salinity plays a greater role in determining density at cold temperatures. Acceleration in Antarctic ice-shelf and land-ice melt could thus significantly impact the ventilation of the world\u2019s oceans, yet future projections do not usually include this effect in models. Here we use an ocean\u2013sea ice model to investigate the potential long-term impact of Antarctic meltwater on ocean circulation and heat storage. The freshwater forcing is derived from present-day estimates of meltwater input from drifting icebergs and basal melt, combined with RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios of projected amplification of Antarctic meltwater. We find that the additional freshwater induces a substantial slowdown in the formation rate of AABW, reducing ventilation of the abyssal ocean. Under both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 meltwater scenarios, there is a near-complete shutdown of AABW formation within just 50 years, something that is not captured by climate model projections. The abyssal overturning at ~30\u00b0S also weakens, with an ~20-yr delay relative to the onset of AABW slowdown. After 200 years, up to ~50% of the original volume of AABW has disappeared as a result of abyssal warming, induced by vertical mixing in the absence of AABW ventilation.

Deterrents to sequestration are primarily an uncertain legal framework and unconstrained operator liability, as well as environmental concerns. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to regulate CCS under a modified rule of the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s Underground Injection Control program. This approach falls short of the comprehensive scheme necessary. It fails to address longterm environmental and financial liabilities unique to CCS and fails to take into account how existing laws and regulations may impede CCS development. This article recommends that CCS be exempted from key federal environmental statutes and regulations and that a wholly unique statutory and regulatory framework be developed as part of a broader effort to curb climate change. Such a framework would limit the long-term liability of injectors to encourage development while offering greater protections for the public and environment against loss and impairment during the highest-risk phases of CCS.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "4e84072a8141eb697681c089a17a29bfb438c0d5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "151317921", "DOI": "10.1533/9781845699581.3.324", "CorpusId": 126473567}, "title": "12 \u2013 Environmental risks and impacts of carbon dioxide (CO2) leakage in terrestrial ecosystems", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) capture at the site of production and storage at deep underground sites is currently being investigated as a way of reducing emissions to the atmosphere. There is potential underground storage capacity for between 1300 and 11 000 Gt of CO 2 , but the risks and impacts on ecosystems of possible leakage from these storage areas and the associated transport systems need to be understood. While the risks in transport, e.g. pipeline failure, are reasonably well known, the experience of deep storage is relatively short and risks are estimated on the basis of scenarios. The main focus of this chapter is on the hazards presented by a leak to the surface. It reviews current knowledge on the impacts of CO 2 leakage on terrestrial ecosystems, including studies of natural and man-made analogues of soil CO 2 enrichment. The effects of elevated atmospheric CO 2 concentrations (denoted here as [CO 2 ]) have been intensively studied: a doubling of atmospheric [CO 2 ] is typically expected to increase the instantaneous rate of photosynthesis by 30\u201350%. However, fewer studies have been carried out on elevated [CO 2 ] in soil. It is generally found that concentrations of up to 2% CO 2 in the soil increase growth, but that at higher levels root and shoot growth are depressed and the plants are visibly stressed. The effect of elevated soil CO 2 is species dependent but, at concentrations above 20%, CO 2 is phytotoxic and vegetation does not grow.", "year": 2010}]}
