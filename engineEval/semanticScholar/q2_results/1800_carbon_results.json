In general, when hot periods last the entire summer, the wet unit of a hybrid cooling system needs to share about 30% of the total plant cooling load in order to minimize the overall system cost.

Among the proposed mitigation strategies, CO2 capture and storage, primarily the injection of CO2 into marine deep geological formations has been suggested as a technically practical option for reducing emissions.

The electrocatalytic activity of NPs depends strongly on their size, shape, and surface attachment. The use of a large number of particles in most reported kinetic experiments obscured the effects of these factors because of polydispersity and different NP orientations. Recent efforts to probe electrochemistry at single NPs included recording of the catalytically amplified current produced by random collisions of particles with the electrode surface, immobilizing an NP on the surface of a small electrode, and delivering individual NPs to electrode surfaces. Although the signals recorded in such experiments were produced by single NPs, the characterization issues and problems with separating an individual particle from other NPs present in the system made it difficult to obtain spatially and/or temporally resolved information about heterogeneous processes occurring at a specific NP. To carry out electrochemical experiments involving only one NP and characterize such an NP in situ, one needs nanoelectrochemical tools with the characteristic dimension smaller than or comparable to those of the particle of interest. This Account presents fundamentals of two complementary approaches to studying NP electrochemistry, i.e., probing single immobilized NPs with the tip of a scanning electrochemical microscope (SECM) and monitoring the collisions between one catalytic NP and a carbon nanopipette. The former technique can provide spatially resolved information about NP geometry and measure its electron transfer properties and catalytic activity under steady-state conditions. The emphasis here is on the extraction of quantitative physicochemical information from nanoelectrochemical data. By employing a polished disk-type nanoelectrode as an SECM tip, one can characterize a specific nanoparticle in situ and then use the same NP for kinetic experiments. A new mode of SECM operation based on tunneling between the tip and nanoparticle can be used to image the NP topography with a lateral resolution of \u223c1 nm. An alternative approach employs carbon nanoprobes produced by chemical vapor deposition of carbon into quartz nanopipettes. One metal NP is captured inside the carbon nanocavity to probe the dynamics of its interactions with the electrode surface on the microsecond time scale. The use of high-resolution transmission electron microscopy is essential for interpreting the results of single-NP collision experiments.

Vehicles with lower powertrain efficiencies have higher fuel consumption. Thus, fuel savings from lightweighting internal combustion engine vehicles can be higher than those of hybrid electric and battery electric vehicles. However, the impact of fuel savings on life cycle costs and GHG emissions depends on fuel prices, fuel carbon intensities and fuel storage requirements. Battery electric vehicle fuel savings enable reduction of battery size without sacrificing driving range. This reduces the battery production cost and mass, the latter results in further fuel savings. The carbon intensity of electricity varies widely and is a major source of uncertainty when evaluating the benefits of fuel savings. Hybrid electric vehicles use gasoline more efficiently than internal combustion engine vehicles and do not require large plug-in batteries.

CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has increased by 33% (to 380\u00a0ppm) since 1750 ad, whilst CH4 concentration has increased by 75% (to 1,750\u00a0ppb), and as the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4 is 25 fold greater than CO2 it represents about 20% of the global warming effect. The purpose of this review is to: (a) address recent findings regarding biophysical factors governing production and consumption of CH4, (b) identify the current level of knowledge regarding the main sources and sinks of CH4 in Australia, and (c) identify CH4 mitigation options and their potential application in Australian ecosystems. Almost one-third of CH4 emissions are from natural sources such as wetlands and lake sediments, which is poorly documented in Australia. For Australia, the major anthropogenic sources of CH4 emissions include energy production from fossil fuels (~24%), enteric fermentation in the guts of ruminant animals (~59%), landfills, animal wastes and domestic sewage (~15%), and biomass burning (~5%), with minor contributions from manure management (1.7%), land use, land-use change and forestry (1.6%), and rice cultivation (0.2%). A significant sink exists for CH4 (~6%) in aerobic soils, including agricultural and forestry soils, and potentially large areas of arid soils, however, due to limited information available in Australia, it is not accounted for in the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. CH4 emission rates from submerged soils vary greatly, but mean values \u226410\u00a0mg m\u22122 h\u22121 are common. Landfill sites may emit CH4 at one to three orders of magnitude greater than submerged soils. CH4 consumption rates in non-flooded, aerobic agricultural, pastoral and forest soils also vary greatly, but mean values are restricted to \u2264100\u00a0\u03bcg m\u22122 h\u22121, and generally greatest in forest soils and least in agricultural soils, and decrease from temperate to tropical regions. Mitigation options for soil CH4 production primarily relate to enhancing soil oxygen diffusion through water management, land use change, minimised compaction and soil fertility management. Improved management of animal manure could include biogas capture for energy production or arable composting as opposed to open stockpiling or pond storage. Balanced fertiliser use may increase soil CH4 uptake, reduce soil N2O emissions whilst improving nutrient and water use efficiency, with a positive net greenhouse gas (CO2-e) effect. Similarly, the conversion of agricultural land to pasture, and pastoral land to forestry should increase soil CH4 sink. Conservation of native forests and afforestation of degraded agricultural land would effectively mitigate CH4 emissions by maintaining and enhancing CH4 consumption in these soils, but also by reducing N2O emissions and increasing C sequestration.

However, the low melting point of pure copper of only 1085 \u00b0C has so far prohibited the synthesis of copper-rich oxygen carriers. This paper is concerned with the development of copper-based and Al(2)O(3)-stabilized oxygen carriers that contain a high mass fraction of CuO, namely, 82.4 wt %. The oxygen carriers were synthesized by using a coprecipitation technique. The synthesized oxygen carriers were characterized in detail with regards to their morphological properties, chemical composition, and surface topography. It was found that both the precipitating agent and the pH at which the precipitation was performed strongly influenced the structure and chemical composition of the oxygen carriers. In addition, XRD analysis confirmed that, for the majority of the precipitation conditions investigated, CuO reacted with Al(2)O(3) to form fully reducible CuAl(2)O(4).

To mitigate this growing concentration of CO 2 , selective carbon capture and storage/sequestration (CCS) are being investigated intensively. However, CCS technology is considered as an expensive and energy-intensive process. In this context, selective carbon capture and utilization (CCU) as a C1 feedstock to synthesize value-added chemicals and fuels is a promising step towards lowering the concentration of the atmospheric CO 2 and also for the production of high-value chemicals. Towards this direction, several strategies have been developed to convert CO 2 , a Greenhouse gas (GHG) into useful chemicals by forming C-N, C-O, C-C, and C-H bonds. Among the various CO 2 functionalization processes known, the cycloaddition of CO 2 to epoxides has gained considerable interest owing to its 100% atom-economic nature producing cyclic carbonates or polycarbonates in high yield and selectivity. Among the various classes of catalysts studied for cycloaddition of CO 2 to cyclic carbonates, porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have gained a special interest due to their modular nature facilitating the introduction of a high density of Lewis acidic (LA) and CO 2 -philic Lewis basic (LB) functionalities.

To validate the approach, synthetic oil mixtures of known composition (pentane, hexadecane) are tested and MMP values are compared to reported values. Results differ by less than 0.5 MPa on average, in contrast to comparison between conventional methods with variations on the order of 1-2 MPa. In terms of speed, a pressure scan for a single MMP measurement required less than 30 min (with potential to be sub-10 min), in stark contrast to days or weeks with existing approaches.

Given plausible fossil fuel use and carbon capture and storage scenarios, and based on modeling of time-dependent leakage of CO2, we employ a climate model to calculate the long-term temperature response of CO2 emissions. We assume that half of the stored CO2 is permanently trapped by fast mechanisms. If 40\u2009% of global CO2 emissions are stored in the second half of this century, the temperature effect of escaped CO2 is too small to compromise a 2.5 \u00b0C target. If 80\u2009% of CO2 is captured, escaped CO2 must peak 300\u00a0years or later for consistency with this climate target. Due to much more CO2 stored for the 3 than the 2.5 \u00b0C target, quality of storage becomes more important. Thus for the 3 \u00b0C target escaped CO2 must peak 400\u00a0years or later in the 40\u2009% scenario, and 3000\u00a0years or later in the 80\u2009% scenario. Consequently CO2 escaped from geological storage can compromise the less stringent 3 \u00b0C target in the long-run if most of global CO2 emissions have been stored.

Believing carbon dioxide to be a threat to the climate, which has been sufficiently evidenced to take actions against it, one possible option is to capture carbon dioxide in power plants and permanently store it underground. In this thesis different technologies for carbon dioxide capture are described. A thermodynamic model for post-combustion capture of carbon dioxide from flue gas is detailed, including thermodynamic models for a humidifier and exhaust gas condenser; components much needed in the proposed power plant layouts for power production with low or no emissions of carbon dioxide. Furthermore, an economic model suitable for modelling power plant schemes with low emissions of carbon dioxide in an economic environment with changing fuel prices and incentives for reduced emissions levels, are also presented. In a number of case studies, the thermodynamic and thermoeconomic performance of such proposed power plant layouts are compared, often with a standard combined cycle used as a reference base. In some case studies the performance, thermodynamic or thermoeconomic, have been optimised with an optimisation tool based on genetic algorithms, a method also thoroughly explained in this thesis.

This study aims to estimate the carbon storage potential of new European buildings between 2020 and 2040. While studies on this issue exist, they mainly present rough estimations or are based on a small number of case studies. To ensure a reliable estimation, 50 different case buildings were selected and reviewed. The carbon storage per m2 of each case building was calculated and three types of wooden buildings were identified based on their carbon storage capacity. Finally, four European construction scenarios were generated based on the percentage of buildings constructed from wood and the type of wooden buildings. The annual captured CO2 varied between 1 and 55 Mt, which is equivalent to between 1% and 47% of CO2 emissions from the cement industry in Europe. This study finds that the carbon storage capacity of buildings is not significantly influenced by the type of building, the type of wood or the size of the building but rather by the number and the volume of wooden elements used in the structural and non-structural components of the building. It is recommended that policymakers aiming for carbon-neutral construction focus on the number of wooden elements in buildings rather than more general indicators, such as the amount of wood construction, or even detailed indirect indicators, such as building type, wood type or building size.

Geological environments and processes that have been proposed for CCS include deep, unmineable coal seams, depleted oil and gas reservoirs, organic-rich shale basins, deep saline formations, and mineral carbonation of basalts. Of these various options, the one that is most attractive owing to its widespread distribution and capacity to store large amounts of CO2 is deep saline formations, with the U.S. Department of Energy reporting that saline formations in the United States could potentially store more than 2,100\u201320,000 billion metric tons of CO2 (DOE, 2012).

Some scCO2 may also be stored by residual trapping in pores via capillary forces. In the discussion to follow, we include residual trapping with structural/stratigraphic trapping as all of these processes involve the storage of a scCO2 phase and, as such, the volume requirements are assumed to be identical for these storage mechanisms for a given mass of CO2.

Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles are coupled in terrestrial ecosystems through multiple processes including photosynthesis, tissue allocation, respiration, N fixation, N uptake, and decomposition of litter and soil organic matter. Capturing the constraint of N on terrestrial C uptake and storage has been a focus of the Earth System Modeling community.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a key enabling technology that can be applied to power generation and industrial processes to lower their carbon intensity. There are, however, several challenges that such a method of decarbonization poses when used in the context of natural gas (gas\u2010CCS), especially for solvent\u2010based (predominantly amines) post\u2010combustion capture. These are related to: (i) the low CO 2 partial pressure of the exhaust gases from gas\u2010fired power plants (\u223c3\u20104%vol. CO 2 ), which substantially limits the driving force for the capture process; (ii) their high O 2 concentration (\u223c12\u201013%vol. O 2 ), which can degrade the capture media via oxidative solvent degradation; and (iii) their high volumetric flow rates, which means large capture plants are needed. Such post\u2010combustion gas\u2010CCS features unavoidably lead to increased CO 2 capture costs. This perspective aims to summarize the key technologies used to overcome these as a priority, including supplementary firing, humidified systems, exhaust gas recirculation and selective exhaust gas recirculation. These focus on the maximum CO 2 levels achievable for each, as well as the electrical efficiencies attainable when the capture penalty is taken into account. Oxy\u2010turbine cycles are also discussed as an alternative to post\u2010combustion gas\u2010CCS, indicating the main advantages and limitations of these systems together with the expected electrical efficiencies. Furthermore, we consider the challenges for scaling\u2010up and deployment of these technologies at a commercial level to enable gas\u2010CCS to play a crucial role in a low\u2010carbon future. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

Annually, each BECCS plant requires 2.33 Mt of biomass and generates 2.99 Mt CO2 of negative emissions and 3.72 TWh of electricity. We make three important discoveries: (a) the impacts of BECCS on ecosystem services are spatially discrete, with the most favourable locations for UK BECCS identified at Drax and Easington, where net annual welfare values (from the basket of ecosystems services quantified) of \u00a339 and \u00a325 million were generated, respectively, with notably lower annual welfare values at Barrow (\u2212\u00a36 million) and Thames (\u00a32 million); (b) larger BECCS deployment beyond 500 MW reduces net social welfare values, with a 1 GW BECCS plant at Drax generating a net annual welfare value of \u00a319 million (a 50% decline compared with the 500 MW deployment), and a welfare loss at all other sites; (c) BECCS can be deployed to generate net welfare gains, but trade\u2010offs and co\u2010benefits between ecosystem services are highly site and context specific, and these landscape\u2010scale, site\u2010specific impacts should be central to future BECCS policy developments.

The net flux between these reservoirs is determined by the relative reservoir size and therefore constitutes a more appropriate description of the carbon cycle than a proportional decay assumption. We exploit the specific feature of our model, the mixing of the carbon reservoirs, by allowing for a special form of carbon capture and storage: The capture of CO2 from the air and the sequestration of CO2 into the deep ocean reservoir. We study the socially optimal anthropogenic intervention of the global carbon cycle using a non-renewable resource stock. We find that this kind of carbon capture and storage facilitates achieving strict stabilization targets for the atmospheric carbon content. It accelerates the slow natural flux within the carbon cycle, and because of its temporary abatement character it dampens the overshooting of the atmospheric reservoir. Furthermore, we analyze the optimal paths of the carbon tax. The carbon tax shows to be inverted u-shaped but depending on the initial sizes of the reservoirs and the speed of carbon fluxes between the reservoirs we also find the optimal tax to be increasing, decreasing or u-shaped.

Climate finance refers to investments specifically in climate change mitigation and adaptation activities, which involve public finance and the leveraging of private finance. A large proportion of climate finance is Official Development Assistance (ODA) from OECD countries to ODA-eligible countries. The evidence shows that the largest proportion of climate finance for climate change mitigation has been channelled to the development of renewable energy, with a much smaller proportion flowing to other crucial forms of clean energy-related measures, such as demand-side management (DSM) (particularly sustainable cooling) and carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS). This forms the rationale and aim of this synthesis paper: to review the role of climate finance to develop clean energy beyond renewables. In doing so, the paper draws on practical policy and programme experiences of some donor countries, such as the UK, and Development Finance Institutions (DFIs). This paper argues that a greater amount of climate finance from OECD countries to ODA-eligible fossil fuel-intensive emerging economies and developing countries is required for sustainable cooling and CCUS, particularly in the form of technical assistance and clean energy innovation. Key policy insights Demand-side management (DSM) and carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS) are underfunded in climate finance compared with the promotion of renewables. Climate finance for sustainable cooling, in particular, represents just 0.04% of total ODA, despite cooling projected to represent 13% of global emissions by 2030. Public investment in CCUS is limited at US $28 billion since 2007, despite the costs of meeting the Paris Agreement estimated to be 40-128% more expensive without CCUS. Additional climate finance for these sectors should not come at the expense of funding for renewables but should be complementary to it.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "02a08e704faf9c50fc0d5747e1bbb3be90c8b176", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "5264509", "DOI": "10.1042/EBC20160016", "CorpusId": 219533141}, "title": "Photosynthesis", "abstract": "Photosynthesis sustains virtually all life on planet Earth providing the oxygen we breathe and the food we eat; it forms the basis of global food chains and meets the majority of humankind's current energy needs through fossilized photosynthetic fuels.

Attention is drawn to the most important parameters of membranes (among other selectivity and permeability) influencing the cost and performance of the whole installation. Numerical model of a membrane was used, among others, to analyze the influence of the basic parameters of the selected membranes on the purity and recovery ratio of the obtained permeate, as well as to determine the energetic cost of the use of membranes for the CO2 separation in IGCC systems. The calculations were made within the environment of the commercial package Aspen Plus. For the calculations both, membranes selective for carbon dioxide and membranes selective for hydrogen were used.

To determine this value, most studies assume predefined, uniform, and constant discount rates, irrespective of the fact that the specific risk strongly varies with the technology concerned and also over time. In order to endogenize the technology-specific risk, we develop a new model that explicitly accounts for the (likewise technology-specific) combination of the underlyings. More specifically, we use a multivariate binomial tree real options approach for analyzing the value of different power plants (gas-fired and coal-fired, with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS); hydro; wind; photovoltaics) and for taking into account technical change. We further investigate the influence of alternative CO$$_2$$2 policies on the plants\u2019 values, modeling the CO$$_2$$2 price in three different ways and for three different carbon price levels (5, 25, 45 \u20ac/t$$_\\mathrm{CO_2}$$CO2): (1) as a stochastic process (geometric Brownian motion), reflecting the price development in the Emissions Trading Scheme of the European Union (EU ETS); (2) as a (constrained) stochastic process with a price floor, and (3) as a deterministic carbon tax. From the model application, using data from German exchange-based markets and a much-cited pilot study on future energy strategies and scenarios in Germany, we find a strong preference for hard-coal power plants in the low CO$$_2$$2 price scenario ($$P_{2015}=$$P2015=\u00a0\u20ac5) and a low value of waiting in case of using the real options model. For all price scenarios, the value of waiting is much higher for both the CO$$_2$$2 permits with a price floor and the CO$$_2$$2 tax policy. This leads, for the medium and high CO$$_2$$2 price scenario, to a dominance of the CCS power plants. In the high CO$$_2$$2 price scenario ($$P_{2015}=$$P2015=\u00a0\u20ac45), the value of waiting only delays the investment decision in the case of the floored CO$$_2$$2 permit prices.

The CAs are among the fastest known enzymes, with kcat values of up to 106\u2009s\u22121 for some members of the superfamily, providing thus advantages when compared with other CCP methods, as they are specific for CO2. Thermostable CAs might be used in CCP technology because of their ability to perform catalysis in operatively hard conditions, typical of the industrial processes. Moreover, the improvement of the enzyme stability and its reuse are important for lowering the costs. These aspects can be overcome by immobilising the enzyme on a specific support. We report in this article that the recombinant thermostable SspCA (\u03b1-CA) from the thermophilic bacterium Sulfurihydrogenibium yellowstonense can been heterologously produced by a high-density fermentation of Escherichia coli cultures, and covalently immobilised onto the surface of magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (MNP) via carbodiimide activation reactions. Our results demonstrate that using a benchtop bioprocess station and strategies for optimising the bacterial growth, it is possible to produce at low cost a large amount SspCA. Furthermore, the enzyme stability and storage greatly increased through the immobilisation, as SspCA bound to MNP could be recovered from the reaction mixture by simply using a magnet or an electromagnetic field, due to the strong ferromagnetic properties of Fe3O4.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "ebe283fa3d3c4cc63571b06471eda439811865bb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2552049065", "CorpusId": 46439970}, "title": "CO 2 abatement in the iron and steel industry - the case for carbon capture and storage (CCS)", "abstract": "A.V.

Significant differences do exist among the models, in particular the seasonal cycle of biomass and export production, but it does not appear that these are necessary consequences of the reduced tracer number. With increasing CO2, changes in dissolved oxygen and anthropogenic carbon uptake are very similar across the different models. Thus, while the reduced\u2010tracer models do not explicitly resolve the diversity and internal dynamics of marine ecosystems, we demonstrate that such models are applicable to a broad suite of major biogeochemical concerns, including anthropogenic change.

India is a major developing economy and the economic growth is driven by ever-increasing consumption of energy. Coal is the only fossil fuel that is available in abundance in India and contributes to the major share of the total primary energy supply (TPES) in the country. Owing to the large unmet demand for affordable energy, primarily driven by the need for infrastructure development and increasing incomes and aspirations of people, as well as the energy security concerns, India is expected to have continued dependence on coal. Coal is not only the backbone of the electric power generation, but many major industries like cement, iron and steel, bricks, fertilizers also consume large quantities of coal. India has very low carbon emissions (~ 1.5 tCO2 per capita) as compared to the world average (4.7 tCO2 per capita) and the developed world (11.2 tCO2 per capita). Although the aggregate emissions of the country are increasing with the rising population and fossil energy use, India has a very little contribution to the historical GHG accumulation in the atmosphere linked to the climate change problem. However, a large fraction of the Indian society is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change \u2013 due to its geographical location, large dependence on monsoon-based agriculture and limited technical, financial and institutional capacity. Today, India holds a large potential to offer cost-effective carbon mitigation to tackle the climate change problem. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is the process of extraction of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from industrial and energy related sources, transport to storage locations and long-term isolation from the atmosphere. It is a technology that has been developed in recent times and is considered as a bridging technology as we move towards carbon-neutral energy sources in response to the growing concerns about climate change problem. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is being considered as a promising carbon mitigation technology, especially for large point sources such as coal power plants. Gasification of coal helps in better utilization of this resource offering multiple advantages such as pollution prevention, product flexibility (syngas and hydrogen) and higher efficiency (combined cycle). It also enables the capture of CO2 prior to the combustion, from the fuel gas mixture, at relatively lesser cost as compared to the post-combustion CO2 capture. CCS in gasification projects is considered as a promising technology for cost-effective carbon mitigation. Although many projects (power and non-power) have been announced internationally, very few large-scale projects have actually come up. This paper looks at the various aspects of CCS applications in gasification projects, including the technical feasibility and economic viability and discusses an Indian perspective. Impacts of including CCS in gasification projects (e.g. IGCC plants) have been assessed using a simulation tool.
