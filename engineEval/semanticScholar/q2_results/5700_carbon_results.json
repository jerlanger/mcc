Many countries are now considering putting a tax on CO2 emissions that will increase the cost of products that are associated with those emissions. The most common method currently considered for dealing with CO2 emissions is the capture of the gas, pressurization, and then sequestration in either rock formations or saline aquifers. This is relatively costly in both capital investment and operation of the equipment. Also, there is the possibility that this CO2 will escape at some point in the future subjecting the company in question to an uncertain risk. Ceramatec has been investigating an alternative approach that converts the CO2 into a useful product that can then be sold. Using solid oxide fuel cell materials in conjunction with a non-carbon source of energy it is possible to generate synthesis gas (CO and H2) and oxygen from CO2 and H2O. SCPV (Solar Concentrator Photovoltaic) systems are the most efficient generators of solar electricity and generate high quality heat at the same time. HTCE (High Temperature Co-electrolysis) uses both the solar electricity and the heat to electrolyze the CO2 and H2O at double the total cycle efficiency of traditional electrolysis. The synthesis gas that is produced can be used to produce synthetic fuels such as synthetic natural gas or Fischer Tropsch liquid fuels, or chemicals. This paper will discuss this alternative approach to the disposal of CO2. This approach has the following advantages: permanent disposal, usable product, storage of solar energy in fuel, reduction of GHG, reduction in solar radiation, and no additional GHG.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "a07fb9282a10ccef06c7d979a0658c510ff7c448", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3083733340", "DOI": "10.14288/1.0394183", "CorpusId": 226501893}, "title": "Carbon capturing storage and utilization at building level : a feasibility study based on life cycle thinking", "abstract": "........................................................................................................................................ iii Lay Summary ............................................................................................................................... iv Preface .............................................................................................................................................v Table of", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "0825c711d7b4d96e95f1ab3fa324d96d62a42536", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1571082022", "CorpusId": 109370022}, "title": "Japan\u2019s Contribution to Cool Earth", "abstract": "The purpose of the \u201cCool Earth 50 Plan\u201d announced by the Japanese Government is to cut global greenhouse gas emissions to half the current level by 2050.

It is difficult (and some would consider it unwise) to project costs up to the year 2030, much less beyond. The already tenuous assumption that current regulatory standards will remain constant becomes more unrealistic as time goes forward, and other unforeseen events (such as technological breakthroughs) loom as critical issues which cannot be modeled. Hence, long-term cost projections are at best speculative, and should be viewed with attentive skepticism. The finer and more detailed the estimate presented, the greater the skepticism should be. In the words of the late Dr. Lincoln Moses, the first Administrator of the Energy Information Administration: \u201cThere are no facts about the future.\u201d But if models cannot reliably predict the future, they can indicate the sensitivity of a program\u2019s provisions to varying economic, technological, and behavioral assumptions that may assist policymakers in designing a greenhouse gas reduction strategy. The various cases examined here do provide some important insights on the costs and benefits of H.R. 2454 and its many provisions. \u2022 If enacted, the ultimate cost of H.R. 2454 would be determined by the response of the economy to the technological challenges presented by the bill. \u2022 The allocation of allowance value under H.R. 2454 will determine who ultimately bears the cost of the program. \u2022 The cases generally indicate that the availability of offsets (particularly international offsets) is potentially the key factor in determining the cost of H.R. 2454. \u2022 The interplay between nuclear power, renewables, natural gas, and coal-fired capacity with carbon capture and storage technology among the cases emphasizes the need for a low-carbon source of electric generating capacity in the mid- to long-term. A considerable amount of low-carbon generation will have to be built under H.R. 2454 in order to meet the emission reduction requirement. \u2022 Attempts to estimate household effects (or other fine-grained analyses) are fraught with numerous difficulties that reflect more on the philosophies and assumptions of the cases reviewed than on any credible future effect. Finally, H.R. 2454\u2019s climate-related environmental benefit should be considered in a global context and the desire to engage the developing world in the reduction effort. When the United States and other developed countries ratified the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), they agreed both to reduce their own emissions to help stabilize atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases and to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases. This global scope raises two issues for H.R. 2454: (1) whether the bill\u2019s greenhouse gas reduction program and other provisions would be considered sufficiently credible by developing countries so that schemes for including them in future international agreements become more likely, and (2) whether the bill\u2019s reductions meet U.S. commitments to stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations under the UNFCCC, and whether those reductions occur in a timely fashion so that global concentrations are stabilized at an acceptable level.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "d347a7f5f2f3fb0a7b74531bb9bdbbda48349945", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2148445305", "DOI": "10.2172/991595", "CorpusId": 130524602}, "title": "Global Deployment of Geothermal Energy Using a New Characterization in GCAM 1.0", "abstract": "This report documents modeling of geothermal energy in GCAM 1.0 (formerly MiniCAM) from FY2008 to FY2009, from the inputs to the U.S. Climate Change Technology Program report (Clarke et al., 2008a) to the present representation, which will be used in future work.

Atmospheric CO2 has been identified as a cause of global warming. On-shore geologic sequestration (OSGS) is a relatively new technology that may be used to reduce atmospheric accumulations of CO2 from coal-fired power plants. OSGS involves capturing, compressing and injecting CO2 deep into the earth and storing it for hundreds or thousands of years or longer. Although the United States Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA2 may accelerate interest in or the need for CO2 capture and sequestration, there are no federal or state laws or regulations specifically designed to regulate OSGS, and legal uncertainty could hinder its development and deployment.3 Based on current law, members of the coal-based power industry and owners and operators of OSGS facilities may face excessive liability that provides little additional protection of public health and the environment. A risk-based approach to regulating OSGS4 is recommended herein to balance legal requirements with the possible risk of harm that may arise from OSGS and to improve legal certainty for those considering its use. Risk-based regulation is the establishment of performance requirements and criteria that correlate directly with the probability and magnitude of foreseeable harm that arises, or that may arise, from a particular site or activity. Risk-based regulation demands stricter requirements where risks are higher. It will provide a sliding scale in which limits on CO2 injection and storage at a particular location may tighten or relax based on advancements in technology and understanding of OSGS and the subsurface.5 By developing a tailored, streamlined and flexible framework of environmental regulations to control OSGS facilities, Congress could efficiently limit long-term liability while still providing strong protection of human health and the environment. Injecting vast quantities of supercritical6 CO2 underground involves inherent risks. Some risks may be minimal, while others could be significant. However, OSGS may be essential to maintain worldwide energy production while protecting human health and the environment from excess CO2 in the atmosphere. The balance between potential public benefits derived from atmospheric protection and risks involved in OSGS must be weighed carefully. Both federal and state laws need to provide clear guidance to the energy industry to move forward with OSGS projects. New laws need to protect human health and the environment, but should also limit disparity between jurisdictions and uncertainty.7 Current laws, such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA),9 could stifle otherwise beneficial uses of OSGS if owners and operators are unnecessarily subjected to severe operational restrictions and unlimited, long-term liability. Recent developments in energy law do not address needed legal considerations for OSGS. The Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007 addresses carbon capture and storage, but does not change either the potentially unduly restrictive application of the hazardous waste aspects of the RCRA nor the potentially unlimited long-term liability imposed under the CERCLA.10 To advance the policy of risk-based regulation, Congress should consider exempting injected CO2 from potential regulation as a RCRA hazardous waste,11 if applicable in the first instance, and should consider limitations on long-term liability. While states may remain legal laboratories,12 the federal government should provide guidance in new OSGS legislation to limit disparate jurisdictional treatment. The overarching goal of protecting public welfare by ensuring that CO2 injected into the subsurface does not harm human health or the environment can effectively be accomplished by using the recommended risk-based approach. \u2026", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "51076883d7249d6d1a4e84275dd39bb1d34b9bf7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2903749551", "DOI": "10.18178/IJCEA.2018.9.1.694", "CorpusId": 139532821}, "title": "Local Corrosion of Martensitic Stainless Steels during Exposure to Saline Aquifer Water and CO2 Environment", "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is well acknowledged to mitigate climate change.

Based on these data, the spatial variations of the neutron emissions from the planet are globally mapped as a function of season, and the dynamics of seasonal variation of neutron fluxes with different energies is analyzed in detail. No differences were found between seasonal regimes of neutron fluxes in different energy ranges in the southern hemisphere of Mars, while the regime of fast neutrons (with higher energies) during the northern winter strongly differs from that during the southern winter. In winter (Ls = 270\u00b0\u2013330\u00b0), the fast neutron fluxes are noticeably reduced in the northern hemisphere (along with the consecutive thickening of the seasonal cap of solid carbon dioxide). This provides evidence of a temporary increase in the water content in the effective layer of neutron generation. According to the obtained estimates, the observed reduction of the flux of fast neutrons in the effective layer corresponds to an increase in the water abundance of up to 5% in the seasonal polar cap (70\u00b0\u201390\u00b0N), about 3% at mid-latitudes, and from 1.5 to 2% at low latitudes. The freezing out of atmospheric water at the planetary surface (at middle and high latitudes) and the hydration of salt minerals composing the Martian soil are considered as the main processes responsible for the temporary increase in the water content in the soil and upper layer of the seasonal polar cap. The meridional atmospheric transport of water vapor from the summer southern to the winter northern hemisphere within the Hadley circulation cell is a basic process that delivers water to the subsurface soil layer and ensures the observed scale of the seasonal increase in water abundance. In the summer northern hemisphere, the similar Hadley circulation cell transports mainly dry air masses to the winter southern hemisphere. The point is that the water vapor becomes saturated at lower heights during aphelion, and the bulk of the atmospheric water mass is captured in the near-equatorial cloudy belt and, thus, is only weakly transferred to the southern hemisphere. This phenomenon, known as the Clancy effect, was suggested by Clancy et al. (1996) as a basic mechanism for the explanation of the interhemispheric asymmetry of water storage in permanent polar caps. The asymmetry of seasonal meridional circulation of the Martian atmosphere seems to be another factor determining the asymmetry of the seasonal water redistribution in the \u201catmosphere-regolith-seasonal polar caps\u201d system, found in the peculiarities of the seasonal regime of the neutron emission of Mars.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "01c6458e34023c5e45585d4626d1328af0800c99", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1901743987", "DOI": "10.1002/9781118991978.HCES134", "CorpusId": 93739138}, "title": "Membrane Technologies for CO2 Capture", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been recognized as one approach for mitigating CO2 emissions, especially from large fossil-fuel combustion units, such as those used for electric power generation and other industrial processes.

The Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is a promising technology supplying clean energy at affordable prices. The IGCC process is currently being coupled with CCS technologies. However, using CCS technologies in power generation processes is a great challenge, necessitating the intensification of the coupled IGCC-CCS process. Process intensification (PI), leads to substantially smaller, cleaner, and more energy efficient processes, and is a prominent topic, receiving significant attention in recent years. As part of intensifying a process, integration of multiple operations (e.g., reaction and separation) in a single unit is often carried out, to improve the existing process efficiency, and to reduce energy consumption, and unwanted output/by-product generation. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the process intensification potential of a technology, containing one or more water gas shift (WGS) reactor components seamlessly integrated with other plant components. We investigate the applicability of various (alternative to the conventional process) novel and efficient reactor configurations that include self-standing adsorptive reactor (AR)/membrane reactor (MR), and the combination of a MR-LTSR-AR-adsorptive separator (AS)-membrane separation (MS) units (herein after referred to as the LTSR-MS/LTSR-AS/AS-LTSR-AS/MR-AS/AS-MR-AS/MR-AR systems). The proposed WGS reactor technologies have the potential to generate highly efficient and ultra-compact processes, by producing H2 for use in IGCC with simultaneous CO2 capture.Innovative designs of the proposed processes are determined based on the comprehensive modeling and design of the selected IGCC plant\u2019s section. Comprehensive, multi-scale, multi-phase, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models are developed for reaction/separation processes. Developed models quantify the many complex physicochemical phenomena occurring within the process, thus providing the basis to better understand, and intensify the overall system. Model predictions are generated for a broad range of operating conditions and design parameters, thus enabling a comparative performance assessment of the proposed process versus a conventional process for the proposed IGCC application.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "f273bc67ec9614c8e2c6274f8d5cf017c04bb66d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "127171539", "CorpusId": 107438672}, "title": "CHALLENGES FOR THE CHEMICAL SCIENCES IN THE 21ST CENTURY.

Here, the temporal dynamics and magnitude of net ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange (NEE) were quantified at a mature short rotation coppice (SRC) willow plantation in Lincolnshire, United Kingdom, under commercial growing conditions. Eddy covariance flux observations of NEE were performed over a four\u2010year production cycle and combined with biomass yield data to estimate the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) of the SRC.

The Bunter Sandstone is a deep saline aquifer with high reservoir quality and is a leading candidate for potential CO2 capture and storage (CCS) in the UK. Brine production optimization during CO2 sequestration is necessary because it helps minimize brine waste and well construction and operational costs. In this paper, various sensitivity analyses were performed investigating well geometry, injection and production well spacing, pressure management and boundary condition effects. Two scenarios were investigated and development plans were proposed for annual injection of 7 MT/yr CO2 (Scenario 1), which is equivalent to the CO2 emissions of a 1.2 GW coal-fired power plant, and for scenario 2, where we aim to utilize the maximum storage capacity of the reservoir model. Three pressure management schemes were compared for each scenario: no pressure management or no brine production, passive pressure management where pressure relief holes are drilled and brine passively flows to seafloor without external energy, and active pressure management where brine is actively pumped out. Brine production rate and relief well patterns were evaluated and optimised. The results show that well perforation length and the use of deviated wells have a significant impact on injectivity improvement whereas well radius has little impact on injectivity. Symmetrical well placements between injection and production wells yields higher storage capacity than asymmetrical ones, and increasing the number of relief wells improves CO2 storage capacity. In the case of open boundary conditions, no pressure management is required because the reservoir quality enables pressure dissipation, resulting in a pressure buildup of less than 5 bars. In the case of closed boundary conditions, either passive or active pressure management is required to prevent seal failure from overpressurization of the reservoir and it also increases storage capacity. The cases with open boundaries, as expected, yield higher storage capacity than the cases with closed boundaries. In scenario 1, or assumed annual injection of 7 MT, storage capacity is 344 MT without pressure management and with open boundaries. This is compared to 332 and 328 MT for cases with closed boundaries and passive and active pressure management, respectively. In scenario 2, the maximum storage capacity of the model is 684 MT with no pressure management and open boundaries, and 504 and 683 MT with closed boundaries with passive and active pressure management, respectively. The storage efficiency ranges from 1 to 6% in scenario 1 to the highest at 12% in the maximum storage capacity case. In addition, three aquifer sizes; open boundary aquifer size of 2.43\u00d71012m3, an aquifer size of 1.8\u00d71010m3 based on pressure recharge studies of the Esmond Gas Field, and closed boundary aquifer size of 1.22\u00d71010m3, were compared for the optimised cases.

This effort has shifted interest from fossil fuels, which have energized the economies of the world for over a century, to non-carbon emitting or renewable technologies. For electricity generation, the non-carbon technologies include wind, solar, hydropower, and nuclear, while low carbon technologies use various forms of biomass. Unfortunately, all current options are significantly more expensive than current commercial fossil fueled technologies. Although use of wind and solar for power generation are increasing, they are incapable of supplying base load needs without energy storage capacity which is currently impractical at the scale required. The only technologies capable of sustaining base load capacity and potential growth are coal, natural gas and nuclear. Nuclear has a long lead time to commercial operation, and concerns about long-term disposal of waste have not been resolved. Natural gas, though lower in carbon emissions than coal, still produces carbon dioxide and its availability and price have proven to be volatile.

Carbon capture and storage is seen as one of the means of mitigating the effects of global warming. Carbon capture technologies can be applied either at the pre-combustion stage, oxy-fuel combustion and post combustion stage. In this paper, absorption which is classified as a post combustion process was used as a means of capture carbon dioxide since most industries utilize packed columns. Absorbents used for this process are amine solutions or alkaline solutions. In this study, for instance, aqueous ammonia was the absorbent. The highlight of this paper focuses mainly on fabricating a wetted wall column to simulate the performance of CO2 absorption from simulated flue gas using aqueous ammonia as sorbent. Testing the feasibility of the design parameters is done by varying two levels of each two factors namely concentration (1M & 3M) and temperature (3\u00b0C & 10\u00b0C) with the overall gas mass transfer coefficient as the response. Analysing the full factorial experiment with the use of Design Expert TM , it is found that concentration of the lean absorbent charged into the system has a greater contribution in the performance of absorption. Percentage CO2 removal is at the very least 72.97% at 1 M aqueous NH3 and 98.33% at 3 M aqueous NH3. Also, overall gas mass transfer coefficient (in mmol m -2 kPa -1 s -1 ) exhibits values that lie around 0.2 when 1 M aqueous NH3was used and 0.4 when 3 M aqueous NH3 was used. These results proved that the greater the concentration of the lean absorbent, the greater fraction of carbon dioxide was removed from the simulated flue gas. The temperature, however, is found to have a slight contribution to the variation in the performance of absorption as far as the percentage of absorbed carbon dioxide and overall gas mass transfer coefficient are concerned. Hence, this may need to undergo further observation. The fabricated wetted-wall column reactor was proven to be fully functional albeit requiring some more installation of auxiliary precision devices and major overhaul of the absorbent line.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "53f6740fbd73f85602bc8ad6c9e56226f9b08307", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1080/10601325.2021.2013727", "CorpusId": 245159103}, "title": "A polymeric suspension of amine functionalized silica nanoparticles derived from Moonj grass for the carbon capture and storage applications", "abstract": "Abstract Herewith, amine functionalization of low cost support from a novel and sustainable source has been entrenched to improve the carbon dioxide (CO2) capture efficiency. The support used is silica nanoparticles (SNPs), derived from a commonly available weed grass namely, Moonj (Saccharum munja L.). The amine functionality was anchored over the SNPs\u2019s surface to obtain amine-functionalized SNPs (AFSNPs) using one step process. The SNPs and AFSNPs were characterized with FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM, and BET to confirm the structural and textural properties. Subsequently, AFSNPs were suspended in a polymeric solution of 1000\u2009ppm hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) forming an AFSNP-HPAM nano-fluid. The nano-fluid remained stable for over 21\u2009days and no sign of sedimentation was observed. Increasing the AFSNPs\u2019s concentration in the nano-fluid increased the viscosity of the nano-fluid while increasing the amine loading over SNPs did not much affect the base viscosity. The nano-fluid showed improved CO2 absorption property for AFSNPs over SNPs. This improved CO2 absorption property can be attributed to the synergy between polymer and AFSNPs. The inclusion of the AFSNPs in the polymer matrix also enhanced thermal stability of polymer at high temperatures. Thus, the utilization of these AFSNPs is proposed in subsurface applications for effective carbon utilization and storage.

In this paper, we present initial results from an ongoing assessment of alternative transition strategies from today's energy system toward widespread use of H2 from fossil fuels as an energy carrier with capture and sequestration of CO2. This study is coordinated with the National Energy Technology Laboratory Carbon Sequestration program and hydrogen modeling efforts at UC Davis and within the USDOE such as H2A. In the future, we plan to utilize data on CO2 sequestration sites from the NATCARB program, and the Regional Sequestration Partnerships. Our model for the design and economics of a fossil H2 energy system with CO2 sequestration considers a number of factors including: * Cost and performance of component technologies making up the system (e.g. fossil energy complex including CO2 capture technology and co-production of hydrogen and electricity, CO2 pipelines and hydrogen storage, distribution and refueling stations). * The location and characteristics of the CO2 sequestration site (storage capacity, permeability, reservoir thickness), * The location, type, size and geographic density of the H2 demand. * Cost, location and availability of primary resources for H2 production such as coal or natural gas. * Location of existing energy infrastructure and rights of way. We have developed techniques for studying regional H2 and CO2 infrastructure development and transition strategies, based on use of Geographic Information System (GIS) data and network optimization techniques. GIS facilitates this analysis by allowing one to use spatially-referenced data, such as existing power plants, coal resources, population distribution, existing rights of way, and CO2 sequestration sites, to calculate the location and magnitude of hydrogen demand and optimize the placement of production facilities and pipeline networks for transporting hydrogen and CO2. We have applied the model to a regional case study of a coal-based hydrogen economy in Ohio with CO2 capture and sequestration. The objective is to model the optimal hydrogen infrastructure design for the entire state under different market penetration scenarios, and find the cost of building the system.

The effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will lead to more renewable energy and less fossil fuel consumption. In parallel, the carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) business is expected to develop rapidly. However, reliably injecting massive amounts of CO2 underground is more challenging than producing hydrocarbons from a known reservoir. Site integrity monitoring and CO2 leak detection are among the biggest challenges. Capabilities to address these challenges will be requested by regulators and the public for acceptance. This surveillance requires technologies such as microseismic monitoring either from the surface or borehole. Each CCUS project will need a preinjection feasibility study in order to design the best sensor network architecture and to set performance expectancies. Acquisition will be performed over long periods of time. Data harvesting and processing will be performed permanently in automated workflows. For these objectives, site operators must demonstrate their expertise through permanent benchmarks based on a common modeling and simulating platform. Microseismic monitoring is not fully mature and presents additional unsolved challenges for large-scale projects such as CCUS. Using a common and public geologic model to generate synthetic data is a solution to gain more credibility. Limitations can be mitigated after analyzing and quantifying gaps such as localization uncertainties. The model is complex due to the nature of CO2 injection and will evolve over time. A public consortium, such as the SEG Advanced Modeling (SEAM) Corporation, that gathers expertise to generate a common model and synthetic data sets will give the credibility and openness necessary to progress in scientific knowledge. It will also provide the necessary transparency for regulatory approval and public acceptance.

Anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases have significantly contributed to the increase in average temperature of the Planet, and are responsible for climate change that are currently been observed. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the most promising technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate change by means of CO2 storage in suitable geologic formations. Aiming to contribute for CCS planning and research investiments in Brazil, it was developed in this work a spatial-technical-economic analysis taking into account CO2 stationary sources, transport infrastructure and geological reservoir for large scale CCS deployment in the Campos Basin, Brazil. A geographic information system (GIS) was used for the collected data analysis and an economic model developed at Utrecht University was applied. Results show that Campos Basin has a large potential for CO2 storage ([texto suprimido]), taking into account the 17 studied hydrocarbon fields. 75,8% of Campos Basin\u2019s storage capacity is in Marlim, Barracuda, Albacora and Roncador oilfields.

The process, which can be retrofitted to existing power stations, burns the pulverised coal in a combination of recycled flue gas and oxygen, instead of air, resulting in a high concentration of carbon dioxide in the flue gas. The CO2 can then be transported and sequestered in a suitable storage site. However, increased concentrations of CO2 and H2O present in the boiler affect the flow dynamics, heat transfer and chemical kinetics that can alter flame shape and stability [1]. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a numerical design tool that can be used to provide detailed insight into chemical reactions, heat transfer and fluid flow phenomena where experiments may be costly or time-consuming to perform. Turbulence is integral to the combustion process of coal and Large Eddy Simulations (LES) offers to predict turbulent flow to a more accurate level than Reynolds Averaging Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. LES models small scales of flow through sub-grid models and directly resolving the larger, more important turbulent length scales capturing fluctuations in more detail compared to RANS and unsteady RANS (URANS) approaches, although it is computationally more expensive, it has in only recent years been applied to simulate the combustion of coal [2-4]. Analysis of flame intermittency and stability can be performed by LES since information, such as animations and transient data, is available which can determine the flicker frequency [5]. Flame stability is an important operational concern in oxy-coal combustion and has been observed experimentally to be dependent on the recycle ratio [6]. Frequency analysis using LES has only been applied to a limited number of studies involving air combustion with coal [3] and not for a variety of oxy-fuel conditions. In this study, LES is applied to a new 250kWth combustion test facility (CTF) firing coal under air and oxy-coal combustion with flue gas recycle (FGR) in order to numerically investigate flame stability. The CFD simulations are validated with experimental results for the combustion of coal in air followed by a numerical assessment of the characteristics and the stability of oxy-fuel flames with 21%, 25% and 30% oxygen concentrations. The results will be used as part of an on-going assessment with the operators of the CTF and compared against available data. This study demonstrates the capability of LES as a design tool for determining flame stability in air and oxy-fuel flames.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "90fbcb64d3e21b62c9d79666d07cbf84857506bc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2732701588", "DOI": "10.1061/9780784480779.076", "CorpusId": 136332804}, "title": "Modelling CO 2 -Trapping Mechanisms for Geological Carbon Capture and Storage: Description of Constitutive Relations", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "f7e9b97426bbd2c0921932ddb76b3a2eb666b590", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2725748095", "DOI": "10.21552/CCLR/2008/4/67", "CorpusId": 134958729}, "title": "Long-term Viability of Carbon Capture and Storage in a European Context", "abstract": null, "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "d2f8a5f7db426ab91ae97ab223b279220944cbc9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2403888453", "CorpusId": 114509232}, "title": "Novel Computational Approach to Obtain Contact Angles: Application to Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "5119a52d6571c06ce99105efa3886d3127936214", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2954064315", "DOI": "10.1080/17597269.2019.1629523", "CorpusId": 198395503}, "title": "Physical\u2013chemical investigation of the oxidation reaction of biodiesel during storage in contact with carbon steel and 1020 steel in the presence of natural rosemary extract", "abstract": "Abstract Biodiesel is a renewable fuel derived from oilseeds or animal fats.

But the next few years are going to be crucial if we are to stand a reasonable chance of keeping global warming to below an average of 2 \u00b0C. Pessimistic media reports reflect the views of only a few world leaders, including Canada\u2019s, who lack ambition and imagination. Other leaders, including the US and Chinese presidents and the summit host, Prime Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen of Denmark, are still pushing for a strong agreement. The science is clear. To limit average global warming to the 2 \u00b0C agreed by world leaders at July\u2019s G20 meeting, total greenhouse-gas emissions will have to peak around 2015 and then decline sharply. If emissions are more than 25% above 2000 levels in 2020, the risk of exceeding 2 \u00b0C in this century would be more than 50%, even if emissions were reduced to low levels by 2050 (M. Meinshausen et al. Nature 458, 1158\u20131162; 2009). Canada should be playing a strong multilateralist part, fulfilling its international commitments, offering constructive proposals on difficult and tense issues, and looking for compromise when positions are entrenched. But Canada has not been constructive and it has isolated itself. It is the only country to have signed up for a target under the Kyoto Protocol and then stated that it has no intention of meeting it. Canada has put forward positions that have heightened, rather than eased, tension. It has argued that developing countries should take on \u2018hard caps\u2019 (which emissions must not exceed, even if production increases) \u2014 something no other country advocates. And it is uncompromising on issues such as using 1990 as a base year, which has blocked agreement. The Copenhagen summit is a big challenge because industrialized countries such as Canada have yet to accept fully that they have a greater responsibility than developing countries for the problem of climate change, and a greater capacity to solve it. Because rich countries have used up so much atmospheric space in the course of their own development, they need to deliver substantial support so that poorer countries can develop without following our dirty path. Wealthy countries need to provide clean technologies and financing \u2014 some US$160 billion per year \u2014 so that developing countries can curb their own emissions and adapt to climate changes that are already happening. Unfortunately, Canada is among the rich countries that have impeded progress in negotiations, and not just because it has disavowed its commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. Its 2020 emissions-reduction target is the weakest of all Kyoto parties\u2019 and it has not supported any options to deliver financing to the developing world. The needs are great. But so are the responsibilities and the opportunities. Canada and other wealthy nations can and must do more. David Suzuki David Suzuki Foundation, Suite 219, 2211 West 4th Avenue, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6K 4S2 e-mail: contact@davidsuzuki.org collaboration as a means to work towards achieving a global low-carbon economy. Within the past few weeks, both the United States and China have announced targets to curb their carbon emissions. With the climate-change summit in Copenhagen this week, the world is expecting further dialogue and collaboration on climate change between the two biggest carbon emitters. Developed nations will benefit, in the long run, from technological cooperation with developing countries. Many carbon-emission reduction technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, are still at an experimental stage, with the United States, Germany and Japan leading their research and development. These countries should expand the scope of their experiments to test commercial feasibility. Many new power plants will be constructed in developing nations, offering a good opportunity for cooperative projects with developed countries to apply new technologies, if agreements can be reached on clean-energy and emissionsreduction programmes.

Design/methodology/approach - The analytical model is developed using a joint production function, where carbon emissions and electricity are jointly produced using capital and fossil fuel inputs. Abatement of emissions can be achieved by investment in production capital that improves the production efficiency or abatement capital that removes the emissions. The results are estimated using data from China's electricity generation sector. Findings - The analytical model shows that economic growth can be achieved while still keeping the emission stock at a stable level. The results show that the level of the tax required to stabilize emissions depends greatly on the efficiency of abatement activities. As an illustration of this result, one finding shows that the required emission tax would be reduced greatly from 16 to 5 yuan/ton of emission when the abatement technology is improved from removing 10 to 30 percent of emissions flow. Research limitations/implications - The lack of carbon capture and storage technology in the real-world limits the ability to estimate some of the results from the economic growth model. Originality/value - Unlike many other papers, the empirical analysis is based on conditions from the economic model.

The anionic charge distribution has also been studied at the abluminal aspect of these vessels at sites of transmural blood cell passage. Cationic surface markers such as colloidal iron, native ferritin and polycationic ferritin used at low pH, 1.8, and the use of neuraminidase show that the nonmodified endothelial cell surface has exposed sialic acid groups, which are absent at the sites of these functional specializations. Polycatiomc ferritin binding over a range of pH levels indicates the presence of another species of anionic materials present at both the nonmodified cell surface and at the sites ofthe cell surface modifications. This second group of anionic compounds is neuraminidase resistant and has a pKhigher than that ofsialic acid (pL:2.6). Cellular functions such as endocytosis, molecular permeability, and transcellular diapedesis involve processes which are initiated at the cell surface and the cell surface can therefore be expected to be a significant, possibly determining factor in these events. It is likely that such functional specializations may be attended by compositional changes in the surface constituents. We have undertaken studies directed towards the detection of possible topographic changes or rearrangements in the cell surface components during these localized activities. The sites of endocytosis, molecular permeability and selec- tive transmural blood cell passage have been examined by means of a positive colloidal iron oxide sob (CI), polycationic (high isoelectric point) ferritin (PCF), native ferritin (NF) and phosphotungstic acid (PTA). The cellular substrate for these studies was the endothelium of the venous sinusoids of the bone marrow. This endothelium dis- plays in a well defined manner the morphological events involved in these cellular activities. The work has been done with the vascular endothelium in situ, i.e., in its normal structural disposition in the myeboid tissue. The preparations were aldehyde fixed. Endocytosis by sinusoidal endothelial cells of bone marrow occurs through plasmalemmal differentiations termed large bristle coated vesicles (LCV) (7). These vesicles capture the particulate, detach themselves from the plasmalemma, and in this way the endocytosed material is initially sequestered in the cytoplasm. This endocytosis by LCV appears to be nonspecific: proteins such as ferritin (7), horserad- ish peroxidase (3), as well as inert particles such as carbon (7) or monodisperse latex spheres (unpublished observations) can in this way be removed from the circulation. The subsequent fate of the endocytosed material is one of two ways. LCV containing particulate fuse with one another while losing their bristle coating and form large smooth membranous storage vesicles (phagosomes). This appears to be the preferred pathway for inert materials. LCV may also fuse with smooth membraned tubules termed \"transfer tubules\" which receive the endocytosed particulates and transfer them to vesicular dense bodies which contain acid phosphatase and are on this basis identified as lysosomes. Although inert particles may also follow the intracel- lular route via transfer tubules, the tubular route appears to be the", "year": 1979}, {"paperId": "58348e87cb8bac1bb8f487abe094c52a60fa16c9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3187890023", "DOI": "10.3390/min11080844", "CorpusId": 238828833}, "title": "Carbon Mineralization with North American PGM Mine Tailings\u2014Characterization and Reactivity Analysis", "abstract": "Global efforts to combat climate change call for methods to capture and store CO2.

One of the possible solutions is geological carbon storage, in which CO2 is captured and injected into geological underground reservoirs for permanent storage. An assessment of the associated CO2 leakage risks is crucial when evaluating potential storage sites. By simulating the movement of CO2 during and in the aftermath of the injection we can determine these risks. In this thesis we present a CO2 migration simulator made for this purpose. There are often great uncertainties in the available geological data required to make realistic simulations. This means that one has to be able to evaluate multiple scenarios within a relatively short time frame, putting performance requirements on the simulator. Because the temporal and spatial scales in question are very big, the full 3D models commonly applied in the related branch of oil and gas simulators are too computationally demanding. Thus, our simulator is based on a 2D VE model. What sets our simulator apart from other VE-based simulators, is that we include non-linearized CO2 properties. This means that the vertical integrals which constitute the VE model are no longer trivial expressions, they must be \u201dfully-integrated\u201d. Through GPU acceleration we implement a simulator that runs just as fast as other CPU-based VE simulators, in spite of the tedious numerical integrations. The benefits of GPU-acceleration are emphasized when simulating on large domains. Moreover we make a comparison study with a VE-based simulator in which the CO2 properties are linearized. The optimization potential and different optimization strategies directed at the GPU implementation of the numerical integrations are also elaborated.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "9dab2125eacf7ffc9d20b8715250b83f4123b40f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3026811081", "CorpusId": 238386877}, "title": "Metal-Organic Frameworks for Gas Storage and Separation", "abstract": "Author(s): Mason, Jarad Adam | Advisor(s): Long, Jeffrey R. | Abstract: The work presented in this dissertation describes the design, synthesis, and characterization of metal-organic frameworks for applications in gas storage and gas separations, with a specific focus on natural gas and hydrogen storage for mobile applications and on post-combustion carbon dioxide capture from coal- or natural gas-fired power plants. A wide variety of techniques and spectroscopic methods are covered, including gas adsorption, x-ray diffraction, infrared and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopies, and calorimetry. Chapter One provides a brief introduction to metal-organic frameworks as a new class of porous materials for gas adsorption-related applications. The potential of metal-organic frameworks for use in post-combustion carbon dioxide capture and natural gas storage is discussed, and the unique and promising properties of adsorbents with stepped adsorption isotherms for these applications are highlighted.In Chapter Two, two representative metal-organic frameworks, Zn4O(BTB)2 (BTB3- = 1,3,5-benzenetribenzoate; MOF-177) and Mg2(dobdc) (dobdc4- = 1,4-dioxido-2,5-benzenedicarboxylate; Mg-MOF-74, CPO-27-Mg), are evaluated in detail for their potential use in post-combustion CO2 capture via temperature swing adsorption (TSA). Low-pressure single-component CO2 and N2 adsorption isotherms were measured every 10 \u00b0C from 20 to 200 \u00b0C, allowing the performance of each material to be analyzed precisely. In order to gain a more complete understanding of the separation phenomena and the thermodynamics of CO2 adsorption, the isotherms were analyzed using a variety of methods. These results show that the presence of strong CO2 adsorption sites is essential for a metal-organic framework to be of utility in post-combustion CO2 capture via a TSA process, and present a methodology for the evaluation of new metal-organic frameworks via analysis of single-component gas adsorption isotherms.Chapter Three briefly discusses high-pressure adsorption measurements and reviews efforts to develop metal-organic frameworks with high methane storage capacities. To illustrate the most important properties for evaluating adsorbents for natural gas storage and for designing a next generation of improved materials, six metal-organic frameworks and an activated carbon, with a range of surface areas, pore structures, and surface chemistries representative of the most promising adsorbents for methane storage, are evaluated in detail. High-pressure methane adsorption isotherms are used to compare gravimetric and volumetric capacities, isosteric heats of adsorption, and usable storage capacities. Additionally, the relative importance of increasing volumetric capacity, rather than gravimetric capacity, for extending the driving range of natural gas vehicles is highlighted. Other important systems-level factors, such as thermal management, mechanical properties, and the effects of impurities, are also considered, and potential materials synthesis contributions to improving performance in a complete adsorbed natural gas system are discussed.Chapter Four discusses the design and validation of a high-throughput multicomponent adsorption instrument that can measure equilibrium adsorption isotherms for mixtures of gases at conditions that are representative of an actual flue gas from a power plant. This instrument is used to study 15 different metal-organic frameworks, zeolites, mesoporous silicas, and activated carbons representative of the broad range of solid adsorbents that have received attention for CO2 capture. While the multicomponent results provide many interesting fundamental insights, only adsorbents functionalized with alkylamines are shown to have any significant CO2 capacity in the presence of N2 and H2O at equilibrium partial pressures similar to those expected in a carbon capture process. Most significantly, the amine-appended metal organic framework mmen-Mg2(dobpdc) (mmen = N,N\u2032-dimethylethylenediamine, dobpdc4\u2013 = 4,4\u2032-dioxido-3,3\u2032-biphenyldicarboxylate) exhibits a record CO2 capacity of 4.2\u00b10.2 mmol/g (16 wt %) at 0.1 bar and 40 \u00b0C in the presence of a high partial pressure of H2O.In Chapter Five, the flexible metal-organic frameworks M(bdp) (M = Fe, Co; bdp2\u2013 = 1,4-benzene-dipyrazolate) are shown to exhibit methane adsorption isotherms that feature a sharp step, giving rise to unprecedented performance characteristics for ambient temperature methane storage. Adsorption measurements combined with in situ powder X-ray diffraction and microcalorimetry experiments performed on Co(bdp) demonstrate a new approach to designing adsorbents for gas storage, wherein a reversible phase transition is used to achieve a high deliverable capacity while providing intrinsic thermal management. Importantly, the energy of the phase transition, together with the adsorption and desorption step pressures, can be controlled through variations in the framework structure, such as replacing Co with Fe, or by application of mechanical pressure. This approach overcomes many of the challenges to developing adsorbents for natural gas storage discussed in Chapter Three and is also relevant to other gas storage applications.Chapter Six discusses the synthesis and characterization of a new Ti(III) metal-organic framework that is constructed from 1,4-benzenedicarboxylate bridged Ti3O(COO)6 clusters. While many metal-organic frameworks have been synthesized with exposed divalent metal cations, there are comparatively few examples of metal-organic frameworks with coordinatively unsaturated trivalent metal centers. Among other potential applications, frameworks with exposed trivalent metal cations are of particular interest for ambient temperature H2 storage. Additionally, there are also very few reported titanium-based metal-organic frameworks and none that contain all titanium(III). Through a combination of adsorption measurements, diffraction analysis, EPR, infrared, and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopies, and magnetic measurements, this framework is shown to contain five-coordinate Ti3+ cations that irreversibly bind O2 to form titanium(IV)-superoxo and -peroxo species.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "895734ad3747405109824776c1574101294abb20", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "7795421", "DOI": "10.3390/ijerph18010120", "CorpusId": 229720272, "PubMed": "33375354"}, "title": "Characteristics of Carbonate Formation from Concentrated Seawater Using CO2 Chemical Absorption Methodology", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage is a popular CO2-reduction technology, and carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technology has been reported frequently over the years.

This study used concentrated seawater to supply metal ions. In addition, the selected 5 wt % amine solution changed CO2 into aqueous CO2 to reduce the additional energy required to form the metal carbonate under moderate conditions. As a result, precipitates were formed because of the reaction of carbonate radicals with metal ions in the seawater. These precipitates were analyzed by X-ray diffraction and field-emission scanning electron microscopy, and they were found to mostly consist of CaCO3 and NaCl. Furthermore, it was verified that the conversion solution maintained its CO2-loading capacity even after the solids and liquid were filtered twice.

Requirements include transparency, accuracy, consistency, and completeness of the GHG data.

A set of new international standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) provides specifications for the quantification, monitoring, and reporting of company entity and project-based activities. The ISO is also developing specifications for recognizing independent GHG verifiers.

The first objective of the project was to determine the optimal amount of alkali in solution for CO2 absorption. This was accomplished using theoretical equilibrium calculations and experimental absorption data for alkali solutions of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 weight %. As the % alkali in solution increased, so, too, did the ionic strength of the solution. Theoretical calculations took into account the effect increasing ionic strength will have on the solubility of gaseous CO2. The calculations assumed negligible formation of H2CO3, constant temperature and constant pressure. In the experimental setup, a 16% CO2/balance air gas mixture was bubbled through an Erlenmeyer flask filled with an alkali solution. The gas exiting the flask was fed to a gas analyzer to record the % CO2 in the exhaust gas stream. The % CO2 absorbed was taken as the % CO2 in the exhaust gas minus the % CO2 in the feed. Theoretical calculations found that as the % alkali in solution increases, the solubility of CO2 decreases.

It is useful to consider the range of possible leak rates for potential CO2 leak pathways from an intended storage reservoir to surface to inform the design of effective monitoring approaches. However, in the absence of a portfolio of leakage from engineered CO2 stores we must instead learn from industrial and natural analogues, numerical models, and laboratory and field experiments that have intentionally released CO2 into the shallow subsurface to simulate a CO2 leak to surface. We collated a global dataset of measured or estimated CO2 flux (CO2 emission per unit area) and CO2 leak rate from industrial and natural analogues and field experiments. We then examined the dataset to compare emission and flux rates and seep style, and consider the measured emission rates in the context of commercial scale CCS operations. We find that natural and industrial analogues show very wide variation in the scale of CO2 emissions, and tend to be larger than leaks simulated by CO2 release experiments. For all analogue types (natural, industrial, or experiment) the emission rates show greater variation between sites than CO2 flux rates. Quantitation approaches are non-standardized, and that measuring and reporting both the CO2 flux and seep rate is rare as it remains challenging, particularly in marine environments.

However, there are some significant challenges for the current flow metering technologies to achieve the specified 1.5% measurement uncertainty in the EU-ETS (European Union \u2014 Emissions Trading Scheme) for all expected flow conditions.

Experimental work was conducted on a purpose-built 25 mm bore two-phase CO2 flow test rig for liquid mass flowrate between 300 kg/h and 3050 kg/h and gas mass flowrate from 0 to 330 kg/h under the fluid temperature of 19\u223c21 \u00b0C and pressure of 54\u223c58 bar. Experimental results suggest that the Coriolis flowmeters with the developed correction method are capable of providing the mass flow rate of gas-liquid CO2 flow with errors mostly within \u00b12% and \u00b11.5% on horizontal and vertical pipelines, respectively.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "bd78b6d3b70440b5e71f03c91d9051c1f8aed113", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2182985641", "CorpusId": 111109561}, "title": "CO 2 capture - New challenge in refinery industry", "abstract": "Emission of CO 2 globally has been brought into attention in recent years through declarations such as the Kyoto and recent Bali conventions, and also by industry leaders committing themselves to substantial reductions.

Consequently, the dire warning of severe weather perturbations and globally rising temperatures have been given. Although scientists, engineers, policy makers, and others are looking for ways to reduce the growing threat of climate change, there is no single answer. Therefore, the development of carbon capture and sequestration technologies, which has accelerated greatly in the last decade, may play a significant role in addressing this issue. Carbon sequestration can be defined as the capture and secure storage of carbon that would otherwise be emitted to or remain in the atmosphere. In order that CO2 can be economically transported and sequestered, carbon capture prefers a relatively pure stream of the gas. Pathways for carbon capture come from potential sources such as several industrial processes which produce highly concentrated streams of CO2 as a byproduct, power plants which emit more than one-third of CO2 emissions worldwide and the production method of hydrogen fuels from carbon-rich feedstocks. CO2 can be removed from the gas streams by physical and chemical absorption. Recently, the chemical absorption using amines represents the most widely deployed commercial technology for capture. However, in other commercial applications, the typical solvents for physically absorbing CO2 include glycol-based compounds and cold methanol. Methanol is a better solvent of CO2 than water, particular at low temperature, because the solubility of CO2 in methanol is approximately five times that in water at ambient temperature and eight to fifteen times that in water at temperatures below 273 K. Therefore, methanol has been industrially used as the physical absorbent of CO2 in Rectisol method at low temperature. 1 Currently, over 70 large-scale plants apply the Rectisol process. On the other hand, for the CO2 sequestration technologies, the chemical conversion of CO2 by radiochemical, chemical, thermochemical, photochemical, electrochemical and biochemical procedures has been of significant interest from the practical viewpoints. The electrochemical method appears to be a very suitable method for the conversion and reduction of CO2. Since the present conversion efficiencies of single crystal, polycrystalline and amorphous silicon solar cells attainable in laboratory experiments are at the respective levels of about 20 %, 15 % and 12%, respectively, one possible system to industrially convert CO2 to useful products may be a hybrid method of the solar cell and the CO2 electrochemical reduction cell. Therefore, a combination technology of the Rectisol CO2 absorption process and the electrochemical CO2 conversion method will be able to apply the large scale plant. Recently, many investigators have actively studied the electrochemical reduction of CO2 using various metal electrodes in organic solvents, because organic aprotic solvents dissolve much more CO2 than water. 2-4 It has been described that low reduced products containing carbon monoxide, oxalic acid and formic acid were produced by the electroreduction of CO2 in dimethly sulfoxide, N,Ndimethyl formamide, propylene carbonate and acetonitrile. However, even at a cupper electrode, few hydrocarbons have been obtained in these organic solvents. Therefore, we tried to the electrochemical reduction of CO2 at Cu electrode in methanol-based electrolyte. 5-7 In the electrochemical CO2 reduction system using methanol, hydrocarbons were formed with relatively high Faradaic efficiencies and their Faradaic efficiencies increased with decreasing temperature. Since the electrochemical reduction of CO2 in organic solvents except for methanol was investigated only at ambient temperature, there is little information on the effect of low temperature on the electrochemical CO2 reduction in organic solvents. Therefore, in the present paper, the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on copper electrode at 273 K are studied in a variety of organic solvents containing dimethly sulfoxide, N,N-dimethyl formamide, propylene carbonate, acetonitrile, ethanol, and methanol. The product distribution in the electrochemical reduction of CO2 on copper electrode in methanol at 273 K is compared with those obtained in the residual organic solvents.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "db1a5118f49a49bda87ce3a25b886c4d51cd04dc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2991360509", "DOI": "10.2174/1874213001912010015", "CorpusId": 209166015}, "title": "CO2 Mitigation in the Power Sector of Thailand: Analyses of Cleaner Supply-side Options Beyond the Paris Agreement", "abstract": "\n \n The drastically increasing share of fossil fuel supply to meet the rapidly growing electricity demand resulting in increasing Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, is the major concern in Thailand.

A promising solution to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere is carbon capture and storage (CCS). These technologies comprise methods to isolate CO2 at its point of production, and inject it \nunderground into a suitable geological formation for long-term storage. While CCS has been demonstrated at a number of sites across the world, there are challenges involved in monitoring the fate of CO2 in the subsurface after its injection. Muon tomography has been suggested as a monitoring technique that can compliment other methods such as repeat seismic surveys. It is proposed that muon detectors, which can be deployed in underground boreholes beneath a storage site, will measure changes in muon intensity caused by variations in the density distribution of the overburden due to the presence of CO2. In this thesis, muon simulations of a geological repository \nare presented to determine the feasibility of muon tomography for monitoring carbon storage sites. In addition, simulations of the local radioactive backgrounds for borehole detectors have been developed to understand their setup and operating conditions.

Particular importance was given to the development of CO2 capture and storage strategies. This work investigates the possibility to use carbonized rice husk as a low cost starting materials for the production of \u0421\u041e2 sorbents. The performances toward CO2 capture of materials based on rice husk were carried out in a static microreactor showed high efficiency up to 60% with respect to the previously studied carbon-based sorbents. Introduction Recently the international scientific community pays a great attention to environmental issues, especially climate change and global warming. Both these issues require global efforts to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). To this aim, CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is still considered the main strategy for achieving CO2 emission reduction targets [1]. Three major CCS approaches are currently applied: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture and oxy-fuel combustion [2]. Post-combustion is the most advantageous CO2 capture strategy, as it does not imply substantial modifications to the combustion process technologies at the present days used. Among the many CO2 separation processes proposed, adsorption is the most mature and commonly adopted due to its high efficiency and lower cost. The use of solid sorbents offers remarkable advantages over the other separation methods because it is characterized by great capacity, ease of handling, selectivity and lower energy for regeneration [3]. A lot of materials have been explored as CO2 sorbent, including amine-impregnated solids [4], carbon-based and graphite/graphene-based materials, zeolite-based materials, MOF-based sorbents, silica-based sorbents, polymer-based adsorbents, clay-based adsorbents, alkali metal carbonatebased adsorbents, immobilized ionic liquid-based adsorbents, LDH-based sorbents, MgO-based sorbents, CaO-based sorbents, alkali zirconate-based sorbents, alkali silicate-based sorbents etc. [57]. This work describes the preparation of solid CO2 sorbents from biomass waste resources, more precisely sorbents based on carbonized rice husk (cRH). Rice is the one of most important cultivated food crop worldwide. It accounts for more than 20% of the world\u2019s crop feeds and productions for approximately 50% of the world\u2019s population. Rice husk (RH) is the hard protecting covering of rice grains. RH protects the seed during all growing season, since it is formed from hard materials, including lignin and opaline silica. Lignocellulosic materials, such as vegetable wastes, if properly treated under controlled conditions are an inexhaustible and renewable source of carbonaceous materials with reproducible chemico-physical characteristics exploitable in CCS approaches. Moreover lignocellulosic materials have a more even geographic distribution compared to that of oil or coal representing recyclable natural alternative to traditional fuel in the production of carbon materials. RH is a large-scale agricultural waste abundantly available in rice producing countries, obtained during the milling of paddy (22 wt. % of the weight of unmilled rice is received as husk) [8, 9] and various methods to produce carbon materials from this are well investigated. RH being the outer shell of rice kernels protects the internal components from external attacks of insects and bacteria, but also RH need to get air and moisture for the growth of corn. Due to this peculiar function, rice in the process of natural evolution has created in its husk characteristics shapes with nanoporous layers. These properties let us applying RH in different field of science: in biomedicine and environmental applications, as fertilizer, as a mineral admixture in concrete, Li-ion battery anodes, petroleum adsorption etc. When RH is carbonized under controlled conditions its surface area and porosity increase making carbonized RH a good candidate for CCS approaches. The adsorption properties of cRH are an interesting research subject in industrial and environmental context. Annually about 200 million tons of RH are produced in the world. The production and use of adsorbent materials based on RH can contribute to mitigate two environmental problems: utilization of agricultural wastes and CO2 abatement. There are many studies on cRH used for waste water remediation, also have a lot of adsorbent for oil products and blood [10-15]. In this work we investigate adsorption behavior of materials based on RH for CO2 capture. Experimental Carbonization of RH was performed in auger furnace in the 500\u00b0 800\u00b0C temperature range for 3 hours. More than 350 kg at day of carbonized rice husk (cRH) in Innovative Enterprises \u201cZhalyn\u201d in Almaty, Kazakhstan can be obtained. Carbonized rice husk features are presented at the Figure 1. high surface area, good porosity and a carbon content around 66 wt.% (EDAX) (RH was investigated in Nanolaboratory, al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Almaty, Kazakhstan). The presence of silica, revealed by EDAX, indicates that cRH can be stored for long time, without significant degradation. Figure 1. Characterization of cRH (SEM and EDAX). Sorbents based on cRH were produced by a base-leaching procedure [16]. We prepared 2 samples by treating cRH with two different strong bases: NH4OH (28% water solution) and NaOH (5M). The obtained samples were labeled as cRH-NH4OH and cRH-NaOH, respectively. Briefly, cRH was suspended into 200 mL of de-ionized water by sonication for 20 min. The mixture was kept at 30\u00b0 C for 30 min under stirring. After that, 10 mL 28% ammonia solution or 5M solution of NaOH was added. The mixture was kept for 1 h at 90\u00b0 C under stirring. The schematically workup of the reaction represent below in Figure 2. Figure 2. Base-leaching method to obtain sorbents based on cRH. Carbon dioxide sorption activity of cRH-NH4OH and cRH-NaOH was assessed by tests in a fixed bed reactor (shown below in Figure 3.) with CO2/N2 gas mixture (15 Nl/h) at a fixed CO2 concentration (3% vol), operating under atmospheric pressure. The CO2 concentration in the inlet and outlet gas streams has been measured by online continuous ABB infrared gas analyzer. A laboratory scale fixed bed Pyrex microreactor (ID = 1 cm, length = 60 cm) operating under atmospheric pressure has been used for the preliminary evaluation of the CO2 adsorption capacity of different samples. N2 and CO2 flowrates have been set by means of mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst), and subsequently mixed before entering the bed (Figure 3.). The CO2 concentration in the column effluent gas is continuously monitored as a function of time (breakthrough curve) until the gas composition approaches the inlet gas composition value, until bed saturation is reached. The time taken by the gas mixture to flow from the fixed bed to the analyzer has been previously measured by flowing the gas mixture through the empty bed (about 50 s) [3]. Figure 3. Fixed bed micro-reactor for measure CO2 capture. These measurements were performed at Institute of Research Combustion IRC-CNR, Napoli, Italy. Results and Discussion Preliminary results in terms of absorbed CO2 moles and time need for saturation of the samples (breakthrough time) are reported in Table 1. As clearly shown by the reported values, the sorption capacity of cRH-NH4OH was about 33.59 mgCO2/g better than cRH-NaOH (21,88 mgCO2/g) and both samples better than raw cRH (11,26 mgCO2/g and 8 s ). Time for saturation better with cRHNH4OH and total 25 s, then cRH-NaOH saturated time for this sorbent 13 s. It is better then samples based only RH, which saturation time was 8 s. Table 1.

CO2 capture capacity of the sorbents obtained from cRH by leaching with NH4OH (cRH-NH4OH) is higher than Ionic liquid supported on carbon black [17]. Also cRH-NaOH sorption capacity is higher than other composite and hybrids materials based on chemico-physical modification of carbon black [17].

Last but not least, the environmental compatibility of the energy sector must be improved, in particular with a view towards global climate change. In the coming years, considerable replacement investments will need to be made, in particular where the electricity sector is concerned. That is why any decision taken today in the context of energy policy is important for the future. Energy policy must pursue the objectives of security of supply, competitiveness and environmental compatibility, giving them equal rank. In this context, it is necessary to establish specific and binding targets for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, both at the international and at the national level. In order to attain these objectives, it will be absolutely necessary to save energy, to increase energy efficiency, to phase out the use of high-emission energy carriers and, in particular, to more intensively use renewable energies. Furthermore, the capture and storage of carbon (CCS) could contribute to reducing the output of gases that have a detrimental effect on global climate. While subsidies for the German hard coal mining industry must be reduced further, the research into and development of CCS technologies should be granted greater support. The consensus reached as to nuclear power plants should not be taken as an excuse to have old nuclear facilities operate for a longer time while reducing the life cycles of nuclear power plants that were built more recently at the same time. Increasing the amounts of electrical power generated in safe nuclear power plants for a limited period of time could provide the sector with the flexibility it needs while achieving an energy mix that is sustainable in the long term. In order to improve energy efficiency and to increase the use of renewable energies, specifically targeted political measures need to be taken.

The oxy-fuel process represents an option for carbon capture in fossil red power plants. Within this ring process, the fuel is combusted with pure oxygen instead of air in order to produce a CO2-rich ue gas stream, which can then be treated and stored. Applying this process to the ring technology of circulating uidized bed (CFB) combustion can combine potential bene ts in terms of CO2-capture e ciency with well-known unique CFB features. Within the scope of this work, the applicability of the in-situ desulfurization using raw limestone in an oxy-fuelred CFB is investigated. The change in reaction atmosphere has an impact on the sulfation reaction mechanisms and reaction rates, and hence in uences the process operation. In a rst step, the reaction kinetics of the limestone sulfation are examined by batch experiments at laboratory scale. Taking into account the in uence of increased CO2 and H2O concentrations in oxy-fuel combustion, the sulfation behavior is investigated in atmospheres from airring to oxy-fuelring with varying temperatures. The most relevant property regarding the sulfation performance is the location in respect to the calcination equilibrium. In contrast to the direct mechanism, during calcination prior to sulfation, signi cantly higher reaction rates and increased sorbent conversion are achieved. Therefore, increased temperatures are necessary to enable calcining conditions within CO2-rich atmospheres. Another signi cant in uence for the calcination under oxy-fuel conditions is the substantial fraction of water vapor in the gas atmosphere: It decreases the temperature raise needed for high CO2 partial pressures in order to obtain a su ciently fast calcination. These ndings are then con rmed by the subsequent oxy-fuel CFB coal combustion tests at pilot scale including the application of in-situ desulfurization. In stable test runs with similar combustion settings, such as excess oxygen and inlet oxygen concentration, as well as comparable limestone injection during both airand oxy-fuelring, a change in the optimal temperature for sulfur capture is determined. In both cases, airand oxy-fuelring, a similar high level of sulfur capture e ciency is reached, though under oxy-fuel conditions, the temperature in the combustion chamber had to be increase from 850\u25e6C, the optimal temperature for airred CFBs, to 875\u25e6C. In addition to that, the chemical analyses of the y and bed ash samples show, that this temperature increase is essential to enable a su cient calcination of the limestone particles.

Climate research wrongly assumed atmospheric pan-evaporation at sea as over land, a 10m well-mixed surface layer, and ignored that seawater density depends on both salinity and temperature.

The doubling time for exponential warming is ~20 years at -0.030-0.037\u00b0Cyr -1 . GHG warming of is now ~1\u00b0C. At present rates, exponential increases add +1\u00b0C in ~20yr, +2\u00b0C in ~40yr, +4\u00b0C in ~60yr, 8\u00b0C in ~80yr above existing levels . Post-1957 carbon dioxide concentration GHG forcing is also doubling in ~20yrs at 0.0268ppmyr -1 . It rose from 1957-1976 by 17.1ppm, and from1977-1998 by 34.4ppm. A further doubling by 68.4ppm would bring total emissions to 435ppm by 2017. It exceeded 400ppm in 2014. Carbon dioxide accounts for three quarters of the GHGs. Of the others, methane and HCFCs already may be out of control. Ocean surface temperature anomalies are close to the proposed +2\u00b0C limit. Century-long records in 5yr anomalies in the North Pacific show peaks of +1.6\u00b0C at the surface in 1995, and +1.3\u00b0C at 5m. North Atlantic peaks were +1.12\u00b0C in 2005 consistent Arctic freshwater fluxes. Central England temperature (CET) 5-yr peak air anomaly was +1.3\u00b0C in 2004 consistent with a rapid response in air due to low heat capacity. 2014 is a record year for temperatures and carbon dioxide total emissions. Pacific sub-surface water warmed faster than at the surface. The freshwater lid that thickened limits heat loss. The annual cycled heat increased by 3MJm -3 over 100yr at Isle of Man, by 1MJm -3 over 88yr at Scripps Pier surface, and by 4MJm -3 over 78yr at 5m. The post-1986 annual Arctic ice heat cycle decreased by -2,633MJm -3 . Before 1986 tropical heat was offset against polar melt and runoff at Port Erin. After, exponentially decreasing Arctic ice reduced thickness from 1.9m-1.4m but surface area decreased more slowly than volume. This accounts for the observed increased polar ice formation surface layer at <4\u00b0C and <24.7\u2030 in Polar Seas. Process rate differences derive from the ~3000x greater heat capacity of water to air (3.9x10 6 : 1.3x10 3 Jm -3 \u00b0C -1 ), and the ~1000x greater density (1023: 1.2 kgm -3 ). The top 10m operates on decadal timescales. Heat is trapped under a surface freshwater lid. Sub-surface heat penetration is on centennial and millennial timescales. It takes ~250yr since the industrial revolution for two thirds of AGW to reach ~300m. The flux of heat and freshwater through Bering Strait doubled from 2000-2007. It accounts for one third of surface layer meltwater fluxes into the Labrador Current at a rate of ~0.85Sv.\u00a0 The Atlantic inflow of ~8.5Sv accounts for the remainder with an Arctic residence time above the halocline of ~2.5-6 years. This is consistent with the three and half years at the Isle of Man between the seasonal 1959 October high and the record 1963 February low. The Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) compensates the land-locked Pacific surface layer bringing warm salty water under the Panama freshwater warm pool. We suggest the doubled warming of the North Pacific led to a quasi-permanent loop in the sub-polar jet stream. Warm air driven over Beringia displaces cold polar air to the North American mid-west. This resulted in continuous extreme weather over central North America in 2013-2014. In the southern hemisphere high evaporation resulted in record precipitation that temporarily reduced sealevels in 2012. Changed ocean ecological systems have been reported. The Pacific warming led to enhanced hurricane frequency from the Panama warm pool as well as super typhoons in the western North Pacific. North America now has hurricane seasons on both coasts and Hawaii, and extreme weather year-round. The warm tropical Gulf Stream/Columbus and Viking polar gyre boundary shifted northwards in the mid 1990s. It shows at Port Erin in a 1990s high seasonal salinity. After the millennium until records ceased in 2006, a seasonal freshwater layer was observed, consistent with a thickened freshwater lid over high salinity tropical water. Most long-term continuous records in the top 5m ceased in the mid 1980s. We suggest the ocean layer is warming exponentially and freshening. Global Ocean warming is known as the tragedy of the commons. Solutions include individual ownership and responsibility through, for example, managing fisheries by individual transferable quotas. The Zero Marginal Cost Society, the adopted goal of the UN and world leaders, requires a painful paradigm transition from a Newtonian to a Thermodynamic stable sustainable no-growth system. The option of population control cannot succeed in time. The EU leaders\u2019 commitment to reduce GHG requires reduction of ~8.9ppmyr -1 for the next 16 years to 2030. It is the only viable solution. However, it requires binding global commitments to a new paradigm conserving thermodynamic principles of maximized use of Earth\u2019s natural resources. In economic terms this means narrowing the gap between rich and poor and deflation to stability of zero growth. Without immediate implementation, we suggest the exponential growth will continue, and may already be beyond control. Our work needs further experimental verification in the near-surface ocean on short space and timescales especially along meridional transects. The Isle of Man and Galapagos Islands, with both tropical and polar water, are ideal to establish constant monitoring of temperature, salinity, pH currents, and sealevel at 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10m along with standard Met observations including pan evaporation and precipitation on purpose-build piers. Ocean-side measurements allow data to be collected efficiently with calibrated instruments if part of well-funded independent University\u2013level research. This way a new generation of young scientists well trained in classical physics can establish the scientific truth through experimental verification. This could proceed as part of a crash program to develop alternative natural energy resources based on geothermal heat exchange, pumped storage, tides and tidal currents, solar, winds and renewable carbon until nuclear fusion comes online as the ultimate solution.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "45904e0468de5bd2c0678d9493a73f9d2c9ee04b", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 212723659}, "title": "Carbon neutrality: taking on the global challenge for ambitious climate action", "abstract": "KEY MESSAGES Countries interested in reaching carbon neutrality ought to : \u275a Urgently act to reach the existing potentials for greenhouse gas emissions\u2019 reduction across sectors, through a combination of technology and behaviour solutions aligned with countries\u2019 development objectives, in order to minimise the level of residual emissions after 2050 and specifically near to zero CO2 net emissions in the energy and the industry sectors; \u275a Renew approaches to protect natural carbon sinks by targeting the sectoral drivers mostly linked to natural ecosystem degradation and destruction on land and sea (unsustainable agriculture and its expansion, deforestation, unsustainable fisheries, coastal planning, etc.) and foster changes in practices inside sectors to protect carbon sinks (e.g., soils in agriculture); \u275a Invest in R&D for carbon capture and storage technologies to deal with the residual emissions, as existing sinks and current innovation options are either not a permanent solution or not ready to operate.

Although most studies of mineral carbonation to date have focused on the carbonation of a pure CO2 gas (i.e., assuming a previous capture step), CCS in a single-step mineral carbonation process may one day be possible.

However, carbon dioxide is a corrosive gas which makes the selection of casing, downhole equipment and cement very important in the well design. Casing and downhole equipment should be made out of steel alloys with a high chrome content or should be protected by regular injection of corrosion inhibitors in the case of steel casing pipe. The cement based on Portland cement is susceptible to corrosion in the CO2 laden fluids or in CO2 supercritical state. The corrosion process commences with the carbonisation of free Ca(OH)2 and the C-S-H gel. Upon the consumption of all available quantities of Ca(OH)2, the resulting calcium carbonate is converted into a soluble bicarbonate, which is then released from the set cement matrix. Consequently, porosity and permeability of set cement increases and its compressive strength concomitantly decreases. Thus, special types of cement should be used. These could comprise of non-Portland based cement or cement blends based on Portland cement with the addition of materials which increase set cement CO2 corrosion resistance. Cement slurries made of these special cement systems have to be optimised in order to obtain rheological and filtration properties required for their application under well conditions. This paper describes the CO2 corrosion of Portland-based set cement and gives an overview of the current knowledge of special cement systems suitable for application in the carbon dioxide rich environment.

The oil production is based on a previous study, which indicates that in 2050 the pre-salt oil production can reach up to 3,160,000 bpd, and the total Brazilian oil production can be up to 3,765,000 bpd. Simulations were made to try to estimate the natural gas production for the period between 2015 and 2050. One great challenge of the petroleum production in this area is to deal with the large amount of CO2 present in these fields. This study considered Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as a mitigating option for the CO2 that would be emitted during the petroleum extraction. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognised as a technology capable of reducing the large-scale emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is an important part of the portfolio of alternatives necessary to achieve significant reductions in the global emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). This study identified that the most suitable carbon capture method for the platforms (Floating Production, Storage, and Offloading (FPSOs)) that will operate in Brazil\u2019s pre-salt fields is the use of membranes. Based on this capture method (membranes), the UOP Separex\u2122 module system is selected as the standard to be tested. It is a compact module that can be installed on FPSOs. Because there remains considerable uncertainty over the precise amount of CO2 present in the natural gas from the pre-salt fields, a wide range, between 10 and 45 %mol of CO2 content was considered. The membrane area for each module was considered to be equal for both 10 %mol and for 45 %mol of CO2. The results show that in 2050, the gas production in the pre-salt region can be around 35,000 Mm3 per year, considering that the amount of CO2 in the natural gas is 10 %mol.

Changes in magnetic permeability influence mostly the real part of the vertical component of the magnetic field. The signal amplitude is more sensitive to a change in the magnetic properties of the cement, rather than the signal phase.

In addition, each subunit of PBPs consists of heterodimer \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits which consisted of linear tetrapyrrole chromophores (one to four chains with A, B, C, and D ring) covalently attached to different cysteine residues of biliproteins.

In this sense, carbon neutral energy systems should already be available in large scale in the transition to the second half of this century. On the other hand, clean energy technologies, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), still need a strong push to achieve their long-term goals. The so-called BECCS systems (sustainable bioenergy systems, combined with carbon capture and storage) are the only option to attain possible negative emissions. Besides the intrinsic challenge of deploying CCS technology, it is necessary to make reality large-scale and feasible bioenergy systems. This brings the attention to the sugarcane industry in Brazil, in which it is possible to produce fuel ethanol at a relative low cost, and with significant avoided GHG emissions vis-\u00e0-vis fossil gasoline. The results related to the avoided emissions could be even improved, with the storage of the CO2 produced during fermentation. However, it is possible to go further because the relatively low cost residual sugarcane biomass (bagasse and straw) has been used in conventional (steam turbine-based) cogeneration systems with substantial surplus electricity generation (2-3 times the electricity required by the industrial process). The availability of sugarcane straw at the mill site is a new issue due to increased mechanical harvesting; with good agricultural practice, it is possible that at least 40-50% of the available straw in the field can be transported to the mill for use as fuel. In addition, with non-commercial BIG-CC systems (integrated biomass gasification to combined cycle), it would be possible to at least double the generation of electricity in a sugarcane plant, compared to the results of conventional cogeneration systems. Moreover, since gasification is required, it would be possible to use precombustion capture technologies, reducing energy penalties. This is the rationale of an ongoing research line: combining the production of liquid fuels and electricity, using sustainable sources of biomass and maximizing carbon capture. In the proposed paper, in both cases the CCS unit considered is amine-based: pre-combustion capture of CO2 from biomass-derived fuel gas after gasifier, and post-combustion capture of the gas mix after its expansion in the gas turbine. Modelling is based on literature information for the technology based on amine, as well as the estimation of energy penalties associated with CO2 capture, transport and storage. The storage location is assessed considering depth conditions of the sandstones of the Rio Bonito Formation, one of the most promising formations for geological storage in Brazil. Preliminary results, based on non-optimized configurations, indicate technical feasibility for both technologies, but an advantage for the pre-combustion route.

The design goals are to reduce energy penalties and maximize CO2 capture. Figure 1 is a flowchart diagram of the BECCS system in the case of post-combustion capture. As shown in the figure, a BIG-CC is integrated into the mill and the steam generated in the HRSG, after turbine expansion, is used to meet the demands of sugarcane processing and the CCS unit. The economic assessment is still ongoing and the cost of capturing CO2 will be estimated for both cases. As for geological storage, a source-sink correspondence based on the location of the sugarcane plants with the possible sinks was performed. Information on the location and milling capacity of 421 sugarcane plants was used and correlated with parameters of ten wells located in the Paran\u00e1 Basin. Results are presented in Figure 2.

CCS can be applied to large point sources of CO2, such as power plants and in large industrial processes. The CO2 capture is to produce a concentrated stream of high-pressure CO2. The capture systems typically employ absorption of CO2 from flue gases with CO2 concentration up to 15 %. The oxygen-fuel systems use oxygen instead of air for fuel combustion to produce mainly water vapour and CO2 (more than 80 %); the water vapour is easily removed by cooling. In precombustion capture, the fuel is converted to CO2 (15 - 60 %) and H2 at high pressure; then CO2 is separated by adsorption or absorption. The emerging capture technologies require development of large-scale membrane separation processes, novel absorption solvents and sorbents, membrane-absorbent systems, high-temperature oxygen transport membranes for oxygen production, oxyfuelling via chemical looping, combined reaction/separation systems and new high-temperature materials.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "d489f4f3ba3d5422da90535e204574ce25d5313c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "233933721", "CorpusId": 107310343}, "title": "exploring The FaTe oF Co 2 aT BriTish ColumBia's planned For T nelson CarBon CapTure and sT orage projeCT", "abstract": "The geochemical reactions involved in injecting fluids into reservoirs remain poorly understood, yet this information is critical to the success of carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects.

Greater environmental focus and increased taxes on emitted CO2 have led to corporate efforts on reducing CO2 emissions. Offshore gas turbines are one of the largest sources of CO2 emissions from the Norwegian industry. One option to reduce the emissions is to capture CO2 from the gas turbine exhaust gas, followed by compression and offshore storage. This process is known as carbon capture and storage (CCS). Due to strict sizing limitations on offshore oil and gas installations, implementation of CCS is totally dependent on a compact and low weight design. To run this process, the reboiler in the desorber section of the CO2 capture plant requires steam. This steam is produced in a low weight steam bottoming cycle that is designed as a part of this study. The aim of this study is to answer the research question: \u201cWhat is the preferred weight estimating method for steam bottoming cycles on offshore oil and gas installations, polynomial representation or scaling laws?\u201d To arrive at a reliable weigh estimate, the steam cycle design is further developed from the specialization project, completed in December 2015. In the simulation software GT PRO, the steam cycle is integrated with CO2 capture and desalination. Because of its importance, the major focus in the design phase was on weight reduction. The total weight is calculated for the fundamental steam cycle components; steam turbine, generator and heat recovery steam generator, and is found to be 437.8 tons. The proposed design produces 37.7 kg s of saturated steam at 5 bar and has a net positive power output of 5 MW with both CCS and desalination implemented, and is therefore self-sufficient with both steam and power. Some promising results for weight estimation have been found. Two different methods were implemented; polynomial representation from weighted least squares method and scaling laws from robust fitting. The polynomial offers more flexibility, because more than one variable can be considered. If one desires a more detailed analysis, or if several design parameters are not yet determined, the polynomial approach is suited. The considered variables are steam and exhaust mass flow, and exhaust temperature. If the boundary conditions are fixed, as in this study, the scaling laws are spot on. Scaling laws form a very elegant linear solution when steam mass flow is considered in the weight estimation. The analyzed real weight data support a linear scaling relationship between weight and mass flow. The base case polynomial estimate made an error of 1.4%, while the scaling law estimate deviated by 0.5%. During validation tests, also outside the calculated range, the maximum errors were 2.2% and 3.1% respectively. The linear scaling law results were almost unrealistically consistent within its calculated range (<1%). This is most likely related to software limitations in GT PRO. II Sammendrag Menneskeskapte klimaendringer fra \u00f8kte CO2-utslipp har skapt bekymring i Norge, og internasjonalt. Et tydeligere milj\u00f8fokus, og \u00f8kte skatter p\u00e5 utslipp har f\u00f8rt til reduserende tiltak hos flere oljerelaterte bedrifter. Eksosgassen fra gassturbiner som opererer p\u00e5 den norske sokkelen bidrar til noen av de st\u00f8rste totalutslippene fra norsk industri. Et aktuelt redukjsonstiltak er \u00e5 fange, komprimere og lagre CO2 fra eksosgassen offshore. Denne prosessen er kjent som karbonfangst og \u2013lagring (CCS). Da dette systemet skal monteres offshore, stilles det h\u00f8ye krav til lav vekt og kompakt utf\u00f8relse. Denne prosessen er avhengig av vanndamp for \u00e5 utskille CO2 i en desopsjonsprosess. Dampproduksjonen foreg\u00e5r i en lavvekts dampsyklus som er utviklet som en del av denne studien. Hovedm\u00e5let med studien er \u00e5 svare p\u00e5 forskningssp\u00f8rsm\u00e5let: \u201dHva er den foretrukne vektestimeringsmetoden for en offshore dampsyklus p\u00e5 oljeog gassinstallasjoner, polynomrepresentasjon eller skaleringslover?\u201d. Et p\u00e5litelig vektestimat er avhenging av en realistisk prosessmodell. Dampsyklusen som ble designet i prosjektoppgaven (Desember 2015) har blitt videreutviklet, og er n\u00e5 integrert med CO2-fangst og et avsaltingsanlegg i simuleringsprogrammet GT PRO. Siden lav vekt er kritisk for offshoreinstallasjoner, var hovedfokuset i designfasen p\u00e5 vektreduksjon. Totalvekten for dampsyklusen er 437,8 tonn, og er beregnet ut ifra hovedkomponentene: dampturbin, generator og dampgenerator. Dampsyklusen produserer 37,7 kg s med mettet damp ved 5 bar, og har et netto elektrisitetsoverskudd p\u00e5 5 MW. Da er b\u00e5de CCS og avsaltingsanlegg implementert, som betyr at systemet er selvforsynt med b\u00e5de damp og elektrisitet. Analyse av simuleringsdata viser lovende resultater for vektestimering. To metoder ble utviklet, polynomrepresentasjon gjennom vektet minste kvadraters metode, og skaleringslover fra robust kurvetilpasning. Polynomrepresentasjonen er mer fleksibel siden flere variabler kan vurderes samtidig. Dette muliggj\u00f8r en mer detaljert analyse, som er n\u00f8dvendig dersom flere parametere er ubestemte. De analyserte variablene er massestr\u00f8m av damp og eksos, og temperaturen til eksosgassen. Hvis grensebetingelsene er l\u00e5st, som i denne studien, er skaleringslover velegnet. Skaleringsresultatene danner en elegant l\u00f8sning som er tiln\u00e6rmet line\u00e6r n\u00e5r vekten analyseres med tanke p\u00e5 massestr\u00f8m. Den line\u00e6re sammenhengen st\u00f8ttes av analysert vektdata for reelle komponenter. Det kalkulerte polynomet hadde et avvik p\u00e5 1,4%, mens skaleringsloven estimerte en vekt p\u00e5 0,5% fra simuleringsverdien p\u00e5 designpunktet. Omfattende valideringstester, ogs\u00e5 utenfor definisjonsomr\u00e5det til de aktuelle variablene, viste maksimale avvik p\u00e5 henholdsvis 2,2% og 3,1%. Resultatene for skaleringslovene var n\u00e6rmest urealistisk entydig innenfor definisjonsomr\u00e5det (<1%). Dette er mest sannsynlig relatert til begrensninger i simuleringsprogramvaren GT PRO.

The fundamental challenge is to develop a portfolio of options that is technically feasible and can provide affordable electricity to customers. As the US industry considers its investments in research, development and demonstration projects, EPRI's PRISM and MERGE analyses address this challenge and point toward a solution that EPRI describes as 'The Full Portfolio'. The PRISM results show much greater use of nuclear power, renewable energy and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) towards 2030, and a sharply lower contribution from natural gas and coal without CCS. The MERGE analysis shows that, assuming CCS would not be available, the use of coal would fall off sharply in favour of natural gas and there would be a fall in electricity demand driven by very high prices. With the Full Portfolio, nuclear power and advanced coal generation with CCS reduce emissions to a point where a much lower demand reduction is needed. By 2050 the Full Portfolio will have decarbonized the electricity sector and reduced the impact on electricity prices to below a fifth that of the limited portfolio. 2 figs.", "year": 2007}]}
