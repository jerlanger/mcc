Rapidly increasing population, higher lifestandards and technological advancements consistently increase the amount of emissions, especially CO2. Nowadays, the most promising solution is to minimize the carbon dioxide emissions with using carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies for a better future. The problem is to choose the best location for CO2 storage which is a crucial and challenging multicriteria decision problem. The objective of this paper is to determine the most appropriate city for carbon dioxide storage in Turkey, by demonstrating a successful implementation of Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) tool. This study presents the use of MCDM method based on Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) to assess the suitable location for CO2 storage. For that purpose, 4 alternative locations were evaluated via 8 criteria which are determined according to the opinions of the experts with background information from the field. Towards this end, MCDM method, namely, TOPSIS, was utilized for the location evaluation. Consequently, this method detects Diyarbak\u0131r as CO2 storage area which is also one of the most important city of Turkey for having finished oil reservoirs and for its geopolitical location.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "2ba821416c56c59f9b5928182e99b38eaba61a12", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 197675842}, "title": "Modelling the mid-term development of the energy system in Poland with the use of TIMES-PL model", "abstract": "The paper presents the results of the mid-term modelling of the development of the energy system in Poland.

The first one, Diversified Supply Technologies (DST) assumes that no technology is preferred and all energy sources can compete on a market basis with no specific support measures. The second scenario, NO_NUC_CCS is similar to the Diversified Supply Technologies but assumes lack of public acceptance for both: nuclear and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies. The main analytical tool used in the analysis is the TIMES model generator. The analysis is carried out with the use of TIMES-PL model for the period 2008 to 2035 with five-year time steps.

CO2 has been identified as a major contributor to global warming because of its high concentration in the atmosphere. The bulk of the recent CO2 increase in concentration in the atmosphere has been attributed to industrial activities, primarily power generation using fossil fuels. The international scientific community, through the IPCC, concluded that action needs to be taken urgently to mitigate carbon emissions before the point of no return in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is reached. In that respect, carbon capture and storage (CCS) was deemed to be the most effective solution to deal with large quantities of CO2 emitted. However, recent studies have shown that whilst this may be true where adequate geological storage site are available both in capacity and quality, many parts of the world simply are not blessed with this natural facility. It is imperative to seek alternatives to underground storage. This is even more important at the present time given that no real progress was made to manage carbon emissions on a large scale despite some CCS pilot studies conducted in Algeria, Norway, Canada, Australia and USA. Our work focused on an alternative to CCS, namely carbon mineralization. This is a special form of carbon conversion that does not have the same disadvantage of energy intensity as catalytic conversion of carbon back into fuel or hydrocarbon feedstock. Our approach is based on a relatively low temperature mineralization exploiting salt in reject brines, thus potentially solving two environmental problems in one single solution. Our work is both experimental and computational and has shown that good salt and carbon conversion at around 30 C is feasible. However, computational simulation work using Excel has shown that this method cannot convert all captured CO2 because of the potentially huge amounts to be captured.

Therefore, the objective of this P.hD. is to build a numerical model to simulate CO$_2$-EGR in partially-depleted gas reservoirs; in particular Centrica Plc's North Morecame gas field. \n \nOur numerical model is based on the so-called Method of Lines (MOL) approach. MOL requires selecting a set of persistent Primary Dependent Variables (PDVs) to solve for. In this case, we chose to solve for pressure, temperature and component mass fractions. Additionally, MOL requires recasting of the governing equations in terms of the PDVs, which often requires the evaluation of partial derivative terms of the flow properties with respect to the PDVs. In this work, a method of analytical evaluation of these partial derivative terms is introduced. Furthermore, in a new approach, the mutual solubility correlations for mixtures of CO$_2$-H$_2$O and CH$_4$-H$_2$O, available in the literature, are joined together using straight lines as a ternary diagram, to form a ternary CO$_2$-CH$_4$-H$_2$O equilibrium model; the equilibrium-model's predictions matched well with the available experimental solubility data. \n \n1D and 2D numerical simulations of CO$_2$-EGR were carried out.

A channel in the borehole cement, which secures the borehole casing to the formation, may allow CO2 to escape. Risk assessment and remediation decisions about the presence of such channels depend on channel parameters: radial position r from the center of the borehole; channel thickness d; azimuthal position \u03c6 of the channel; and azimuthal extent \u03b8 of the channel. Current state-of-the-art cement-bond logging technology, which uses only the first arrival at a centralized borehole receiver, can diagnose limited details about CO2 leak channels. To accurately characterize the possible leak paths in the cement, we use a 3-dimensional finite-difference method to investigate the use of the abundant data collected by a modernized monopole sonic tool that contains an array of azimuthally distributed receivers. We also investigate how to improve the tool design to acquire even more useful information. For cases where borehole fluid is either water or supercritical CO2, we investigate various receiver geometries, multimodal analyses of multi-frequency data to discover the type of logging tool that provides the best information for CCS management. We find that an appropriate choice of wave modes, source frequencies, source polarities, and receiver locations and offsets provides sensitivity to d, \u03c6, \u03b8. The amplitude of the first arrival from a monopole source is sensitive to \u03b8. Amplitudes at receivers at different azimuths are sensitive to \u03c6.

Reaction to this report should be considered in the context that the IPCC is a highly authoritative source. It was established in 1988 by the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organisation to provide policymakers with regular assessments of the scientific basis of climate change, impacts and options for adaption and mitigation. It is an inter-governmental body in which 195 member countries collectively set the work program, and accept and adopt the reports. (It assesses rather than conducts scientific research directly). Thousands of scientists from throughout the world contribute to its review processes. Its assessments are thus highly deserving of government and public attention, and action. The new report estimates, with high confidence, that global warming is likely to reach 1.5\u00b0C between 2030 and 2050 (a mere 12 to 32 years) if it continues to increase at the current rate. Global mean temperature is already 1C above the 1850-1900 (pre-industrial) baseline. Many land and sea ecosystems and associated services have already changed due to global warming. Stabilising the climate at around 1.5C, the target preferred in Paris at COP21 in 2015, will depend on the intensity, promptness and effectiveness of interventions. The IPCC argues that to restrict warming to 1.5C, carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced to almost zero by 2050. Pathways modelled to achieve this show coal use for electricity needs to phase right out, and renewables would need to supply 70 to 85 per cent of electricity. For Australia, an immediate challenge is how to deal with its most significant emitter and shut down up to 12 coal-fired power stations by 2030 (i.e. in 12 years) (Slezak 2018). Some of these are already programmed for closure and others would be within five years of life span in any event (Slezak 2018). This requires progress in technology and affordability for storage of renewably-produced power (Hundloe and Hartzer 2018), an economic opportunity for Australia given the extent of lithium produced in Western Australia (IPCC 2018, chapter 4). While a transition away from coal has opportunities for alternative power sources, it also has implications for job losses in the energy and mining sectors with major impacts on our regional communities. It will require an orderly timetable and thoughtfully considered investment in transitions. The Report is a dire warning that if the world does not decrease carbon emissions seriously and rapidly, we will not be able to avoid the far more serious impacts on the planet\u2019s liveability of a 2C rise in global mean temperature. This must be coupled with increased carbon dioxide removal, through the familiar afforestation and reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, and new technologies such as direct air carbon capture and storage. The higher the temperature rise, the greater the repercussions in the form of higher sea level rise, intense storms, heavy precipitation, extreme heat, droughts and ocean acidification, all concerns for Australia, and some for New Zealand. Global impacts include health, food security, water supply, and irreversible impacts on ecosystems. Multiple inter-related climate risks will become more evident as global temperatures rise.

The end result of the insights gained, alongside an understanding of stakeholder relationships with achieving the commercial application of CCS technology, are three development paths for CCS. These three storylines describe a \u201cfast\u201d, \u201cslow\u201d, and \u201cfailed\u201d commercialization of CCS technologies. This work can be built upon for use as a decision making tool by stakeholders involved in CCS to aid in understanding how to act today based on how the future may look. Strategizing in this dynamic manner can help to understand the possible ways in which stakeholders can affect or be affected by the potential development paths of CCS, one of which is the commercial applications of the technology.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "7178a0fa0b88320ed0538584ce8a3159031dff9a", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 45087229}, "title": "Post Combustion Capture Conference ( PCCC 3 ) Development and optimization of a temperature swing adsorption process for post-combustion CO 2 capture in integrated steelworks", "abstract": "Iron and steel production is one of the most energy-intensive manufacturing processes accounting for 10-15% of the total industrial primary energy consumption [1]. Given that the energy needs of the process are satisfied by fossil fuels and/or electricity from the grid, which also largely relies on fossil fuel consumption, the amount of anthropogenic CO2 emissions ascribable to the iron/steel production are approximately 5% of the total world emissions [2]. In light of the constant increase in crude steel production [3] along with the 2\u00b0C target, the stabilization of the CO2 emissions from iron/steel production is a critical need. In order to mitigate the emissions, two main routes can be pursued: i) increasing the energy and process efficiency or, ii) adopting processes for carbon capture and storage. While the former has been effectively fostered during last years, leading to a drastic decrease of the process energy intensity [4], the latter has not been deployed yet. Considering the largest CO2 point sources i.e. the blast furnace-based integrated steelworks the number and interdependency of processes makes a variety of different integrated CO2 capture solutions possible. Accordingly, pre-combustion, post-combustion or oxycombustion CO2 capture can be applied at different stages of the manufacture process. One effective strategy to deploy CO2 capture in iron and steel production plants is to apply the carbon capture process exclusively to the bottoming power cycle that uses the carbon-rich gases released from the blast furnace reactor, the coke oven, and the base oxygen furnace.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "b9632445e6af1737f8fc81149b43fb67a17287df", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2981600933", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-030-26759-9_37", "CorpusId": 211760905}, "title": "Sustainable Development Goals as a Tool to Evaluate Multidimensional Clean Energy Initiatives", "abstract": "Great contributions are expected by the public from science and technology (S&T), especially now, given the highly complex environmental and social challenges such as climate change, cleaner and affordable energy provision and economic crises, among others.

Our analysis takes explicitly into account that the supply of electricity at the wholesale level (generation) is organized competitively in some U.S. jurisdictions, while in others a regulated utility provides integrated generation and distribution services. For either market structure, we find that emissions charges in the range of $25-$30 per tonne of CO2 would be the break-even value for adopting CCS capabilities at new coal-fired power plants. The corresponding break-even values for natural gas plants are substantially higher, near $60 per tonne. Our break-even estimates serve as a basis for projecting the change in electricity prices once carbon emissions become costly. CCS capabilities effectively put an upper bound on the rise in electricity prices. We estimate this bound to be near 30% at the retail level for both coal and natural gas plants.

However, such important role of tropical forest is very fragile from extreme changes in temperature and precipitation, because carbon storage in forest landscape is strongly related to those climate variables.

Brine migration into potential drinking water aquifers due to the injection of CO2 into deep saline aquifers is one of the potential hazards associated with the Carbon Capture and Storage technology (CCS). Thus, in any site selection process, an important criterion should be the evaluation of brine migration resulting from the injection. We follow an interdisciplinary approach using participatory modeling to incorporate stakeholder opinion at an early stage in order to discuss and evaluate model conception and relevant scenarios for brine migration. The basis for this approach is a realistic (but not real) on-shore site in the North German Basin with characteristic geological features for that region. Our model fully couples flow in shallow and in deep saline aquifers including variable-density transport of salt and a realistic description of the top surface boundary conditions with groundwater recharge and rivers. We investigate different scenarios to identify relevant system components. Further, different model simplifications are compared and discussed with respect to the relevant physical processes and the expected data availability, i.e. to find a model as complex as necessary and as simple as possible. It becomes clear that the initial salt distribution plays a key role as to where noticeable concentration changes may occur. Also the boundary conditions are important for determining the amount of vertically displaced brine.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS), and carbon capture and utilization (CCU), by which CO2 emissions are captured from sources such as fossil power generation and combustion processes, and further either reused or stored, are recognized worldwide as key technologies for global warming mitigation. This paper provides a review of the latest published literature on small-scale carbon capture (CC) systems as applied in micro combined heat and power cogeneration systems for use in buildings. Previous studies have investigated a variety of small- or micro-scale combined heat and power configurations defined by their prime mover for CC integration. These include the micro gas turbine, the hybrid micro gas turbine and solid-state fuel cell system, and the biomass-fired organic Rankine cycle, all of which have been coupled with a post-combustion, amine-based absorption plant. After these configurations are defined, their performance is discussed. Considerations for optimizing the overall system parameters are identified using the same sources. The paper considers optimization of modifications to the micro gas turbine cycles with exhaust gas recirculation, humidification, and more advanced energy integration for optimal use of waste heat. Related investigations are based largely on numerical studies, with some preliminary experimental work undertaken on the Turbec T100 micro gas turbine. A brief survey is presented of some additional topics, including storage and utilization options, commercially available CC technologies, and direct atmospheric capture. Based on the available literature, it was found that carbon capture for small-scale systems introduces a large energy penalty due to the low concentration of CO2 in exhaust gases. Further development is required to decrease the energy loss from CC for economic feasibility on a small scale. For the micro gas turbine, exhaust gas recirculation, selective gas recirculation, and humidification were shown to improve overall system economic performance and efficiency. However, the highest global efficiencies were achieved by leveraging turbine exhaust waste heat to reduce the thermal energy requirement for solvent regeneration in the CC plant during low- or zero-heating loads. It was shown that although humidification cycles improved micro gas turbine cycle efficiencies, this may not be the best option to improve global efficiency if turbine waste heat is properly leveraged based on heating demands. The biomass-organic Rankine cycle and hybrid micro gas turbine, and solid-state fuel cell systems with CC, are in early developmental stages and require more research to assess their feasibility. However, the hybrid micro gas turbine and solid-state fuel cell energy system with CC was shown numerically to reach high global efficiency (51.4% LHV). It was also shown that the biomass-fired organic Rankine cycle system could result in negative emissions when coupled with a CC plant. In terms of costs, it was found that utilization through enhanced oil recovery was a promising strategy to offset the cost of carbon capture. Direct atmospheric capture was determined to be less economically feasible than capture from concentrated point sources; however, it has the benefit of negative carbon emissions.", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "89a05a18af94029e23b5eeeebf6ce0b0d874345e", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 231854668}, "title": "memc nano NanoMaterials Enhanced Membranes for Carbon Capture", "abstract": "Within the current environmental concerns about global warming, Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is seen as a necessary medium-term technology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere while waiting for a complete transition towards a more sustainable energy system.

The NANOMEMC2 project aims to overcome such limitations through the development of CO2 capture innovative materials, membranes and processes which can achieve a substantial cost reduction, and help achieve the reduction of CO2 emissions.

The formations of interest for CO2 storage in the reef trend in northern Michigan consist of depleted oil and gas reservoirs which have undergone primary production.

Natural gas hydrate is formed by physical binding between water molecule and gas mainly composed of methane, which is captured in the cavities of water molecules under the specific temperature and pressure. 1m 3 methane hydrate can be decomposed to the methane gas of 172m 3 and water of 0.8m 3 at standard condition. Therefore, there are a lot of practical applications such as separation processes, natural gas storage transportation and carbon dioxide sequestration. For the industrial utilization of methane hydrate, it is very importantto rapidly manufacture hydrate. However, when methane hydrate is artificially formed, its reaction time may be too long and the gas consumption in water becomes relatively low, because the reaction rate between water and gas is low. So in this study, hydrate formation was experimented by adding natural zeolite and Synthetic zeolite 5A in distilled water, respectively. The results show that when the Synthetic zeolite 5A of 0.01 wt% was, the amount of gas consumed during the formation of methane hydrate was higher than that in the natural zeolite. Also, the natural zeolite and Synthetic zeolite 5A decreased the hydrate formation time to a greater extent than the distilled water at the same subcooling temperature.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "3c64c9107f442a897d4dd86ea196e06ffeeea931", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2914677057", "CorpusId": 162176260}, "title": "EVALUATING THE EU'S ENERGY INNOVATION SYSTEM", "abstract": "The aim of this paper is to evaluate the consistency of directed innovation activity in the EU with the priority areas set out in the SET Plan.

In the meantime, oil is projected to maintain a major position in supplying primary energy for a long time to come. To tackle this problem, increases in energy efficiency and a shift to non-fossil fuels are of utmost importance.Along with these measures, gas flaring reduction and carbon capture and storage (CCS) are also very effective ways to reduce global warming gas emissions.In spite of the efforts taken by individual oil companies, the amount of global gas flaring still remains at a high level because of several constraints encountered in flaring countries. While CCS is a very promising option for drastically reducing emissions if applied at large power plants which burn fossil fuels, there is still a long way to go for this option to be accepted as a reliable and affordable means.This presentation reviews international efforts to promote these two measures and provides information on how they are progressing in Russia, Nigeria, Canada and the EU.Lastly, the presentation highlights some specific topics in related international carbon reduction efforts including CDM, CCS EOR, emissions trading and increasing public awareness in environmental issues.The concluding message is that the challenge for sustainable energy development in the new century has already started, and the roles of oil companies are essential as a main player in the high energy society.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "37125ffd23644654eaa828635a7f785dcdb4d501", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3086808850", "DOI": "10.1007/s13753-020-00298-3", "CorpusId": 221744516}, "title": "The Neglected Role of Risk Mitigation Perception in the Risk Governance of Underground Technologies\u2014The Example of Induced Seismicity", "abstract": "Subsurface technologies, such as geothermal energy and carbon capture and storage, are options to help limit global warming.

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) can be an influential technological route to curb climate change to a significant extent by preventing CO2 discharge. One of the pathways to realize BECCS is via in situ CO2-sorption coupled with a thermal plasma gasification process. In this study, an equilibrium model is developed using RDF as a model compound for plasma assisted CO2-sorption enhanced gasification to evaluate the viability of the proposed process in producing H2 rich syngas. Three different classes of sorbents are investigated namely, a high temperature sorbent (CaO), an intermediate temperature sorbent (Li4SiO4) and a low temperature sorbent (MgO). The distribution of gas species, H2 yield, dry gas yield and LHV are deduced with the varying gasification temperature, reforming temperature, steam-to-feedstock ratio and sorbent-to-feedstock for all three sorbents.

The main objective of the present thesis is to model and compare the performance of different process configuration solutions for the removal of CO2 from flue gases employing piperazine as solvent. Flowsheet models were assembled for five configurations using gPROMS ModelBuilder 4.1.0. The base case used for comparison is the conventional process for amine scrubbing, whose main components are a simple absorber and a simple stripper. New equipment units were incorporated in the simple flowsheet, successfully improving the energy requirements. In order to ensure an objective and consistent analysis of the solvent and each configuration studied, the models were validated with experimental data publically available provided by \u201cThe Rochelle Lab\u201d, placed at the University of Texas at Austin. CO2 capture rate presented a maximum deviation of -12 %, and the rich loading shown even lower deviations: between and 5 %.

They are an ideal target for emission reduction from coal-fired power plants in the sourcesink model. However, unlike hydrocarbon reservoirs which are typically well developed, these deep formations face the challenge of characterization due to a lack of data and their uncertainty. Spatial reservoir information is critical in understanding CO2 injectivity, plume dynamics, and pressure management during and after injection operations. In this study, we combine geologic and dynamic data from the Shenhua CCS Demonstration Project in the Ordos Basin, China to provide an improved explanation for the pressure behavior and interesting injectivity at the site as well as presenting a risk assessment study of long-term storage safety. We extend the work of Nguyen et al. (2017a, b) in that a system of interconnected meandering channels are incorporated into our geologic model to account for the pore volume needed to allow high injectivity. CO2 injection simulations are carried out by varying geologic and rock/fluid parameters to generate scenarios that offer a better understanding of the subsurface spatial heterogeneity which contributed to our observed behavior. Simulation results suggest that the lateral extent of conceptual fluvial channels may not be as extensive as previously thought since the pressure front travels faster than our CO2 plume, resulting in minimal pressure buildup at the bottom-hole level. Our study also finds that the injection well may have penetrated a sandbody with interconnected permeability which contradicts the notion in previous work that a high permeability area to the Northwest of the injection well may be the cause of low-pressure buildup. Injection rate allocation is an important parameter in explaining the bottom-hole pressure (BHP) response at the injection well. Our models also provide a range of scenarios with the target 300,000 tons of CO2 being successfully injected into 5 layers of saline aquifers, with the sandstone Liujiagou formation receiving most of the injection. Risk assessment based on these scenarios honoring historical injection data suggests that there is a low probability of CO2/brine leakage through legacy wellbores in the area, including the injection and two monitoring wells.\n", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "b797012bf0ac7e0e79c7c6cb68cf78796bb1c6f3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "181459893", "CorpusId": 54826669}, "title": "Nuclear Power as a Climate Change Mitigation Option: a Modelling Approach", "abstract": "Although nuclear power can provide electricity with very low life cycle carbon emissions and thus reduce the cost of climate change mitigation, it also brings along many specific challenges: accident risk, need for radioactive waste management and nuclear weapons proliferation risk. Due to this controversial nature nuclear power, among other energy forms, has been relatively little studied in a climate mitigation context. This thesis aims to provide some insight into the possible role of nuclear power in climate change mitigation. \nIn the first paper we assess the impact of potential nuclear expansion and advanced nuclear cycles on climate change mitigation cost and reflect on this expansion\u2019s relation to nuclear weapons proliferation risk. We find that nuclear power can reduce the mitigation cost around 20%, and new reactor types and advanced uranium extraction methods provide a significant part of the savings (10%). To materialize those savings however the number of reactors would need to increase tenfold by 2070, which implies an increase in enrichment and/or reprocessing facilities, technologies that are directly related to proliferation risk. We show that even if reprocessing can be made proliferation safe as some scientists believe, the switch to a closed fuel cycle that does not need enrichment will take more than the remainder of this century under a cost minimising condition, and therefore proliferation risk cannot be eliminated. \nIn the second paper we investigate further the mitigation cost reducing ability of nuclear power by subjecting our model to numerous parameter variations and a Monte Carlo analysis. We observe that nuclear power can provide significant cost savings in almost all cases and that the expansion of nuclear power is dependent on climate policy.

Polymeric membranes are the preferred choice for the gas separation industry due to simpler methods of fabrication and lower costs compared to inorganic or mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). However, plasticisation and upper-bound trade-off between selectivity and permeability has limited the gas separation performance of polymeric membranes. Recently, researchers have found that the blending of glassy and rubbery polymers can effectively minimise trade-off between selectivity and permeability. Glassy poly(ethersulfone) (PES) and rubbery poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) are polymers that are known to have a high affinity towards CO 2 . In this paper, PEG and PES are reviewed as potential polymer blend that can yield a final membrane with high CO 2 permeance and CO 2 /nitrogen (N 2 ) selectivity.

N-Methyl-2-Pyrrolidone (NMP) and Dimethylformamide (DMF) are common industrial solvents used for membrane fabrication.

The global energy research firm estimated that hydrogen currently costs $200 to $250/bbl to produce\u2014as much as five times the cost to produce a barrel of oil. Low-carbon hydrogen has a tiny share of the global energy market today, but investors are betting on its long-term potential, according to Wood Mackenzie, who said shares with meaningful exposure to hydrogen have been among the best-performing of energy transition stocks in the past few months. By 2050, low-carbon hydrogen will constitute 7% of global energy demand\u2014211 Mt\u2014from practically zero today.\n For this and other reasons, many oil companies are researching and investing in hydrogen projects. IHS Markit believes that energy companies will invest $5 billion to $10 billion in hydrogen of various colors over the next 5 years, helping to develop breakthrough technologies that will reduce its cost and increase its competitiveness, not only with renewables such as wind and solar, but eventually with oil and natural gas.\n Paul Browning, president and chief executive officer of Mitsubishi Power Americas, said, \u201cWhat\u2019s really driving green hydrogen is net zero, from regulators to shareholders. There is no way to get to net zero without long-term storage, and for that, we need hydrogen,\u201d he said. \u201cGreen H2 will be used as storage first.

Blue hydrogen, integrated with carbon capture and storage, can provide the scale and reliability needed by industrial processes. It can also play an essential role in decarbonizing hard-to-electrify industries and driving down the cost of the energy transition.

A new solvent such as 3-amino-1-propanol (AP) has been designed to be used as an alternative solvent for CO2 removal. This solvent should provide the absorption and cyclic capacities close or higher than the commercial ones. The objective of this research is to measure the CO2 absorption in a 4 M aqueous solution of AP at the temperature from 303.15 K to 353.15 K and CO2 partial pressures ranging from 5 to 100 kPa and the absorption results of CO2 in AP solution are compared with that of aqueous solution of MEA.

Beyond emission reductions, carbon capture and storage (CCS), viewed as a novelty by some just a few short decades ago, has leaped to the forefront of greenhouse-gas management solutions, with big players committing big money to projects aimed at ensnaring, transporting, and burying the waste deep underground.\n Last April, ExxonMobil unveiled plans for a $100-billion CCS hub for the Port of Houston. Dubbed the CCS Innovation Zone, it is expected to be a public-private partnership that will attract participation and funding from companies and government entities. In September, the supermajor went on a buying spree in the shallow-water US Gulf of Mexico (GOM) as part of federal Lease Sale 257. It was the apparent high bidder on 94 tracts to the tune of just under $15 million. While these are presently structured as hydrocarbon leases and the company has kept mum on its motivations, the move was almost certainly to gain access to coast acreage that could potentially serve as subsurface storage locations for the proposed Houston hub.\n Following the lease sale, Spanish operator Repsol said it had partnered with US independent Cox Oil to jointly explore CCS opportunities on the private operator\u2019s shallow-water GOM acreage. Under the terms of the agreement, the consortium will share technical knowledge and resources to evaluate potential projects that would combine the offshore expertise and operations of Cox Oil with Repsol\u2019s technical knowledge and global experience with CCS projects.\n Then there is Talos Energy. The Houston-based independent has jumped feet first into the CCS pool, announcing a pair of US-based projects with designs on making carbon capture a steady revenue contributor over the coming years.\n Early in 2021, the company evaluated various green businesses where it could make a difference\u2014and a dollar\u2014including carbon capture, but also wind and wave energy. At that time, CCS was more of a peripheral discussion, but as the company took a closer look it became apparent that its skill set and investment profile lined up best with a role in carbon capture.

Therefore, it is of utmost importance that a series of problems involving the growth paths of fatigue cracks in CO2 pipelines with crack-like surface defects are taken into account when the leak-before-break(LBB) fracture criteria is used to evaluate the safety of pressure piping. Based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics(LEFM) theory and the ABAQUS software platform, this paper builds a three-dimensional finite element model of a pipe segment containing an axial semi-elliptical inner surface crack, which can be used to obtain the fracture parameters of the surface crack under axial forces, bending moments, and/or internal pressures by adopting the virtual crack closure technique(VCCT). On the platform of this presented finite element model in fracture mechanics, focusing on two types of thin-walled CO2 pipelines(thickness-radius ratios: t/R=1/10 and 1/27.3) under their specific operation pressures, this paper mainly discusses fatigue propagation problems of an axial semi-elliptical in-wall surface crack with different initial aspect ratios(?0\u2264 1) caused by pressure fluctuation. Specifically, the fatigue propagation paths of the six inner surface cracks are analyzed when their initial aspect ratios are chosen as 1, 2/3, 1/2, 1/4, 1/6 and 1/8, respectively. The fatigue propagation stages for these cracks are drawn and their fatigue crack growth lives are compared. Meanwhile, the effect of thickness-radius ratios on the crack growth trends is also discussed. The numerical results show that the fatigue growth paths of these cracks have a close relationship with their initial geometrical shapes. There also exists an asymptotic route for fatigue propagation of these cracks, which is closely connected with the thickness-radius ratio of pipeline.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "c081fdf75eeaf1956194568dd60d6d3417a26e82", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3038358477", "DOI": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/MSF.1000.318", "CorpusId": 220334690}, "title": "Numerical Simulation of Carbon Dioxide Absorption by Monoethanolamine Solution with Super Mini Ring Contactor", "abstract": "Carbon capture storage provides an alternative to reducing global warming.

This was i.a. followed up by the recognition by the European Council of 8 and 9 March 2007 of the vital importance of achieving the strategic objective of limiting the global average temperature increase to not more than 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. It was also made an independent commitment on part of EU to achieve at least a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 The European Council further adopted an Energy policy for Europe (EPE). As part of the EPE the Member States and the European Commission (Commission) were urged to work towards developing the necessary technical, economic and regulatory framework to bring environmentally safe carbon capture and sequestration storage (CCS) to deployment with new fossil-fuel power plants, if possible by 2020. In this connection the European Council welcomed the intention of the Commission to establish a mechanism to stimulate the construction and operation by 2015 of up to 12 CCS demonstration plants. As from this European Council one may say that CCS became an important element in achieving the committed to goal of 20% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In Norway, the coalition government and most of the opposition parties entered into a Climate agreement on 17 January 2008, based on the Government\u2019s recommendation of 22 June 2007. Here the broad lines of Norway\u2019s climate policy in the coming years were drawn up. This included i.a. that Norway was to become \"carbon neutral\" by 2030 reducing emission of greenhouse gases of 15-17 million tons CO2 equivalents by 2020 including the effect of forests. This implies that 2 3 of Norway\u2019s total emission reduction is to take place in Norway. Norway is to actively participate in international climate negotiations, based on the goal of a reduction of global temperature increase of less than 2 degrees C, compared to pre-industry level. It was further agreed to launch a CCS action plan. In the Council\u2019s conclusions on EU relations with EFTA countries of 14 December 2010 it is i.a. noted that the cooperation between Norway and the EU on environmental and climate change matters continues to be good. In spite of the general positive attitude towards applying state aid to CCS demonstration projects, Norway, as an EEA Member state, was the first state to commit state aid to CCS demonstration projects. In October 2010 the Commission authorised the Netherlands to provide State aid of EURO 150 million to a CCS project in Rotterdam. There are clear indications that several EU Member states are prepared to allocate state funds to CCS demonstration projects. The dependency on CCS, the urgency of establishing CCS demonstration projects and a recognised market failure as regards investments in such projects, create a pressure both on EU and EU funds and on EU and EEA Member states to provide funding. The EU has not limited itself to stating its favourable attitude towards state aid to CCS demonstration projects, but has launched primarily two projects facilitating financing of such projects. These are the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) with total funds of initially Euro 1,050 billion for CCS demonstration projects and the New Entrants Reserve (NER) providing for 300 million allowances being available partly for CCS, partly for renewable energy, demonstration projects. This article will describe and assess the divergent objectives and different conditions for obtaining financial support from state aid according to Article 107 (3) (b) and (c) TFEU Article 61 EEA, EEPR and NER funding. The interplay and possibility of cumulation of the different sources of financing, the question of a minimum financial commitment from the operator and possible required results concerning captured CO2 will be given special attention.

Mapping and monitoring this variation is essential if policy developments such as REDD+\u2009(Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) are to be known to have succeeded or failed.ResultsWe produce a map of carbon storage across the watershed of the Tanzanian Eastern Arc Mountains (33.9 million ha) using 1,611 forest inventory plots, and correlations with associated climate, soil and disturbance data. As expected, tropical forest stores more carbon per hectare (182\u00a0Mg C ha-1) than woody savanna (51\u00a0Mg C ha-1). However, woody savanna is the largest aggregate carbon store, with 0.49 Pg C over 9.6 million ha. We estimate the whole landscape stores 1.3 Pg C, significantly higher than most previous estimates for the region. The 95% Confidence Interval for this method (0.9 to 3.2 Pg C) is larger than simpler look-up table methods (1.5 to 1.6 Pg C), suggesting simpler methods may underestimate uncertainty. Using a small number of inventory plots with two censuses (n\u2009=\u200943) to assess changes in carbon storage, and applying the same mapping procedures, we found that carbon storage in the tree-dominated ecosystems has decreased, though not significantly, at a mean rate of 1.47\u00a0Mg C ha-1\u00a0yr-1 (c. 2% of the stocks of carbon per year).ConclusionsThe most influential variables on carbon storage in the region are anthropogenic, particularly historical logging, as noted by the largest coefficient of explanatory variable on the response variable. Of the non-anthropogenic factors, a negative correlation with air temperature and a positive correlation with water availability dominate, having smaller p-values than historical logging but also smaller influence. High carbon storage is typically found far from the commercial capital, in locations with a low monthly temperature range, without a strong dry season, and in areas that have not suffered from historical logging.

In this work, the modelling of CO2 sequestration involves the simulation of CO2 capture from flue gases and the CO2 storage in the subsurface considering a sustainability approach. The main focus of the CO2 sequestration is to reduce the greenhouse emission but in many cases, the models do not consider the carbon footprint associated with the process. We present an integrated approach where the CO2 sequestration model involves the power plant simulation of the CO2 capture, the numerical simulation of CO2 storage, economics and the life cycle assessment for the minimisation of the carbon footprint. This study provides an insight for future development of integrated approaches considering oxycombustion carbon capture focussed on the air separation unit and the simulation and monitoring of the subsurface storage sites.\n Our work considers the CO2 capture process using Cryogenic and Membrane Air Separation Units for Oxi-Combustion because it is associated with a reduced carbon footprint when compared to other processes as post-combustion and pre-combustion. Our CO2 storage approach includes the compositional simulation of fluid flow in porous media and the characterisation of the sealing rock above realistic heterogeneous storage models by using an Ensemble Kalman Filter approach on a long term simulation of 100 years. Initial realisations of the subsurface model were generated using stochastic modelling and considering the uncertainty on the petrophysical properties of the rock, in particular permeability and porosity. In this work, one of the main purposes of the CO2storage simulation is to avoid the vertical leakage of the CO2 and for this, the fluid saturation in every cell is monitored during the simulation approach.\n From the results associated with the oxy-combustion application, the Cryogenic model and membrane model reduce the carbon footprint by 78.34% and 66.84% respectively compared to the power plant model without carbon capture. It is also observed that electricity consumption produces the biggest carbon footprint portion for both models, hence future improvement should be focused in reducing process energy requirement. In terms of energy production, carbon footprint, and economic, oxy-combustion power plant with cryogenic air separation demonstrates better performance. However, the results of this study indicate that the membrane O2/N2 needs produce lower net power production and oxygen purity compared to the cryogenic model. Hence, further development of membrane material is still needed before it can be considered as a competitive option for air separation unit. An economic evaluation is also performed and the results show that cryogenic air separation is still a more economical option compared to membrane. The design of the well locations is dependent of the heterogeneity of the model and the correct characterisation of the sealing rock.

At regional to country scales, methods have been progressively developed to detect and map forest degradation, with these based on multi-resolution optical, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and/or LiDAR data. However, there is no one single method that can be applied to monitor forest degradation, largely due to the specific nature of the degradation type or process and the timeframe over which it is observed. The review assesses two main approaches to monitoring forest degradation: first, where detection is indicated by a change in canopy cover or proxies, and second, the quantification of loss (or gain) in above ground biomass (AGB). The discussion only considers degradation that has a visible impact on the forest canopy and is thus detectable by remote sensing. The first approach encompasses methods that characterise the type of degradation and track disturbance, detect gaps in, and fragmentation of, the forest canopy, and proxies that provide evidence of forestry activity. Progress in these topics has seen the extension of methods to higher resolution (both spatial and temporal) data to better capture the disturbance signal, distinguish degraded and intact forest, and monitor regrowth. Improvements in the reliability of mapping methods are anticipated by SAR-optical data fusion and use of very high resolution data. The second approach exploits EO sensors with known sensitivity to forest structure and biomass and discusses monitoring efforts using repeat LiDAR and SAR data. There has been progress in the capacity to discriminate forest age and growth stage using data fusion methods and LiDAR height metrics. Interferometric SAR and LiDAR have found new application in linking forest structure change to degradation in tropical forests. Estimates of AGB change have been demonstrated at national level using SAR and LiDAR-assisted approaches. Future improvements are anticipated with the availability of next generation LiDAR sensors. Improved access to relevant satellite data and best available methods are key to operational forest degradation monitoring.

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is a GHG and plays a major role in the formation of global warming because of its enormous concentration present in the atmosphere which is increasing year by year. Scientists report human-made CO2 emissions continue to rise above levels not seen in hundreds or thousands year, they also predict the costs of the damage incurred through global warming as tens of billions of dollars a year. Technologies such as carbon capture and storage, carbon capture and utilization, increasing the use of renewables, carbon capture and reuse etc are available with us as a sole purpose to minimize CO2 emissions found in the atmosphere. Technologies stated above will be definitely used in future for sustainable living.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "96d27faec5e98c6974520b4727c07a75dce6dcf0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2748239210", "CorpusId": 32639441}, "title": "Effects of Arbuscular Mycorrhiza and Phosphorus Supply on the Growth of Perennial Ryegrass", "abstract": "Aim: The basic aim of this thesis was to disentangle phosphorus status-dependent and -independent effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF, Glomus hoi) on the components of plant growth: morphology and assimilation rates, in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). Materials & Methods: In a first experiment, I assessed phosphorus response functions of leaf and plant morphological components in undisturbed plants with similar size. To this end, nonmycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants were grown in controlled conditions at four different soluble phosphorus supplies ranging from 0 mM to 0.5 mM. In a second experiment, AMF effects on carbon economy were investigated by comparing nonmycorrhizal and mycorrhizal plants of similar size, morphology and phosphorus content. 13CO2/12CO2 steady-state labelling was used to trace all photosynthate assimilated during one photoperiod, and a respiratory 13CO2/12CO2 exchange system to assess dark respiration rates, and the contribution of recently fixed carbon to shoot and root respiration. Results & Discussion: Relative growth rate of mycorrhizal plants was significantly higher as a result of improved phosphorus nutrition. The presence of AMF stimulated relative phosphorus uptake rate, decreased leaf mass per area (LMA) and increased shoot mass ratio at low phosphorus supply. Lower LMA was caused by both decreased tissue density and thickness. Variation in tissue density was almost entirely due to variations in soluble carbon, while that in thickness involved structural changes. Carbon economy analyses revealed that AMF enhanced relative respiration rate of the root-soil system by 16%, inducing an extra C flow amounting to 3% of daily gross photosynthesis. Total C drain for growth and respiration of the AMF was estimated at \u2264 8% of daily gross photosynthesis. This was associated with a greater amount of new C allocated below-ground and respired in mycorrhizal plants. AMF colonization affected the sources supplying below-ground respiration, revealing a greater importance of plant C stores in supplying respiration and/or the participation of storage pools within fungal tissues. Conclusions: The relationships between relative phosphorus uptake rate, leaf and plant morphology were identical in mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal plants. Beneficial effects of mycorrhizal symbiosis were mainly mediated by adjustments in leaf morphology, which were largely dependent on AMF effects upon phosphorus capture. When ontological and nutritional effects are accounted for, AMF increased below-ground costs, which were not compensated by increased photosynthesis rates.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "5876f0179c181ba2d3491cec11fa1fa6d7ceae0c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2890020261", "CorpusId": 170006798}, "title": "The Value of Concentrating Solar Power for a Sustainable Electricity Supply in Europe, Middle East and North Africa", "abstract": "Dispatchable solar power from concentrating solar thermal power plants (CSP) combined with thermal energy storage and co-firing option can provide energy according to demand. A transfer of such electricity from solar thermal power plants in desert regions to distant consumer centres may therefore complement regional or domestic energies. The research question of the value of this transfer was already analysed in qualitative studies that found out a high potential of this idea. However, a detailed energy system modelling showing the value of concentrating solar power plants from Middle East and North Africa (MENA) for Europe (EU) was not yet done. This thesis closes the scientific knowledge gap applying an energy system model with a least-cost approach and detailed scenario analysis for the year 2050. The thesis describes the effects of including and excluding a transfer of CSP from MENA to EU. The transfer-system consists of a power plant and a high voltage direct current transmission (HVDC) and is therefore called CSP-HVDC (concentrating solar power \u2013 high voltage direct current) power plant. The techno-economic assumptions for this composed technology are strictly chosen to avoid its overestimation. The assessment of CSP-HVDC considers energy system evaluation criteria. These multicriteria reveal the impact of CSP-HVDC on energy infrastructure, operational behaviour, cost and emission of the energy system. To evaluate national grid expansion, a new grid II methodology is introduced as composed of transmission and distribution grid. This new model reduces complexity of the grid and analyses grid expansion considering different power plant park portfolios. As a result CSP-HVDC-application proves to require a future national grid expansion to a far lesser extent than a system with high shares of wind and photovoltaic energy. This is substantiated by a validation with a high-resolution grid model. Integrating CSP-HVDC into the national grid brings about reduction of grid stress due to lower capacity peaks in the transmission lines of the grid. Cost sensitivity analyses indicate the cost uncertainty of the energy system. The examination of system cost uncertainty shows that an appropriate share of dispatchable energy including CSP-HVDC generates a minimal system cost uncertainty. Analysis of cost relations of CSPHVDC to all other used technologies (e.g. nuclear and carbon capture and storage technologies) point out how high the probability of an integration of CSP-HVDC is. Inside the EUMENA region (Europe, Middle East and North Africa) various regions are subdivided. Due to different characteristics of regional energy systems, it depends on the model region in EU how probable it is that CSP-HVDC is integrated. For some EU regions up to 66% integration probability can be achieved. The result of multi-criteria evaluation shows that power plant capacity, electrical storage expansion, and electrical curtailment cause a lower impact when CSP-HVDC is used to supplement the energy portfolio. However, the strict model conditions lead to a higher needed transmission infrastructure altogether, when CSP-HVDC is applied in high shares because of its long transfer distance. Lower CSP-HVDC shares can reduce the total transmission infrastructure of single regions. Another result demonstrates that system cost does not play the essential role in quantifying the value of CSP-HVDC because system cost differences may be small. The right share of CSP-HVDC offers a higher degree of freedom, more options and compromises for the design of a low carbon energy system under the included evaluation criteria mentioned above. Thus, a technologically diverse energy system with low carbon emission rather benefits from CSP-HVDC.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "62c5645284644c238c968c4ecf4844e3b4158eb7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "231001223", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-12940-2_7", "CorpusId": 128089603}, "title": "The CarbFix Procedure", "abstract": "Scientists have sought for processes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions when harnessing geothermal resources, for the power intensive industry and other applications.

The system uses the sterically hindered amine 2-Amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) mixed in different concentrations with the organic solvent N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP). In comparison with the traditional absorption system using aqueous Monoethanolamine (MEA), the AMP in NMP system has shown promising potential as it is possible to regenerate the amine at relatively low temperatures (70-90 \u00b0C), which could lower the energy requirements for CO2 removal. Another possible advantage of the system is that when AMP reacts with dissolved CO2 it forms an unstable carbamate ion that precipitates as the CO2 loading in the absorption mixture is increased. This opens up for the possibility to only regenerate part of the stream, concentrated in solid precipitate, lowering the energy consumption for regeneration further. In order to continue the research and perform an evaluation on the reaction kinetics of the absorbing system, there is a need for further characterization and thus some physical properties need to be evaluated. Both in terms of kinetics and modelling, properties such as viscosity, solubility and diffusivity are crucial. In the current work, the physical solubility of CO2 in solutions of AMP in NMP, at different temperatures, has been evaluated. The solubility of CO2 in the pure solvent NMP has previously been determined to be many times higher than the solubility of CO2 in water. Due to CO2 undergoing reaction with the amine in the solution mixture, the inert gas N2O is used to avoid reaction. To estimate the solubility of CO2 in the solution mixtures, the N2O analogy will be used (Eq.1). The solubility experiments were carried out at 25 and 40 \u00b0C for mixtures with AMP concentrations of 15 and 25 wt% and for the pure solvent. Duplicate experiments were performed for each data series in order to ensure good repeatability. The solubility measurements were carried out using a true heatflow reaction calorimeter, CPA 201.

Therefore, it is necessary to examine the effect of impurities on both enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) performance. For Canada Weyburn W3 fluid, a 2D compositional simulation of water-alternating-gas (WAG) injection was conducted to analyze the effect of impure CO2 on EOR and CCS performance. Most components in the CO2 stream such as CH4, H2, N2, O2, and Ar can unfavorably increase the MMP between the oil and gas mixture, while H2S decreased the MMP. MMP changed according to the type and concentration of impurity in the CO2 stream. Impurities in the CO2 stream also decreased both sweep efficiency and displacement efficiency, increased the IFT between gas and reservoir fluid, and hindered oil density reduction. The viscous gravity number increased by 59.6%, resulting in a decrease in vertical sweep efficiency. In the case of carbon storage, impurities decreased the performance of residual trapping by 4.1% and solubility trapping by 5.6% compared with pure CO2 WAG.

Although these currently are provided as national estimates by pool and year to meet greenhouse gas monitoring requirements, there is growing need to disaggregate these estimates to finer scales to enable strategic forest management and monitoring activities focused on various ecosystem services such as C storage enhancement. Through application of a nearest-neighbor imputation approach, spatially extant estimates of forest C density were developed for the conterminous U.S. using the U.S.\u2019s annual forest inventory. Results suggest that an existing forest inventory plot imputation approach can be readily modified to provide raster maps of C density across a range of pools (e.g., live tree to soil organic carbon) and spatial scales (e.g., sub-county to biome). Comparisons among imputed maps indicate strong regional differences across C pools. The C density of pools closely related to detrital input (e.g., dead wood) is often highest in forests suffering from recent mortality events such as those in the northern Rocky Mountains (e.g., beetle infestations). In contrast, live tree carbon density is often highest on the highest quality forest sites such as those found in the Pacific Northwest. Validation results suggest strong agreement between the estimates produced from the forest inventory plots and those from the imputed maps, particularly when the C pool is closely associated with the imputation model (e.g., aboveground live biomass and live tree basal area), with weaker agreement for detrital pools (e.g., standing dead trees).

The performance of these adsorbents in a PSA reactor for CO2 hydrogenation with a commercial catalyst (Cu/ZnO/Al2O3) is compared by simulation.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "f9b9a26f565ccb7b08ea2b66ad5f69a0c63b80ae", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 216561460}, "title": "GHG ASSESSMENT TOWARDS CLIMATE POLLUTION CONTROL IN THERMAL POWER PLANTS A CASE STUDY Neyveli Lignite Corporation Limited Neyveli, INDIA", "abstract": "---------------------------------------------------------------------***--------------------------------------------------------------------Abstract Coal based thermal power plants are the major sources in India to meet the ever increasing demand for power and as such there is a need to address the issue of controlling climate pollution by mitigating Green House Gases (GHG) from their emission stack. Technologies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) are widely considered to be a possible technical option to mitigate carbon dioxide from such large-point source. However, the economics of CCS is a major barrier and constrain.

This FOA called for what was essentially a two-tier selection process. A number of projects would receive awards to conduct front-end engineering and design (FEED) studies as Phase I. Those project sponsors selected would be required to apply for Phase II, which would be the full design, construction, and operation of their proposed technology. Over forty proposals were received, and ten were awarded Phase I Cooperative Agreements. One of those proposers was CEMEX. CEMEX proposed to capture and sequester carbon dioxide (CO2) from one of their existing cement plants and either sequester the CO2 in a geologic formation or use it for enhanced oil recovery. The project consisted of evaluating their plants to identify the plant best suited for the demonstration, identify the best available capture technology, and prepare a design basis. The project also included evaluation of the storage or sequestration options in the vicinity of the selected plant.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "943b2a28ca5d988c86ffe473bbbd21dddb671ab1", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 222245810}, "title": "Sze\u0301n-dioxid ta\u0301rola\u0301ssal kapcsolatos \u201ea\u0301sva\u0301nyvagyon\u201d nyilva\u0301ntarta\u0301s nemzetko\u0308zi", "abstract": "The need to assess the potential of CO2 storage complexes and their related respective storage capacities is quite a new area of study. Carbon capture and geological storage (CCS) has only recently been recognized as an efficient means of mitigating climate change. In Europe, with the exception of Norway, the significance of CCS activity only reached that critical level involving the demand for a standardized registry after 2007; furthermore, this task has been confronted by the institutions responsible for resource management. Since 2007, the capture and geological storage activity of carbon from industrial sources has developed dynamically on a worldwide scale. However, over the last 4\u20135 years Europe \u2014 which at one time led research in this field \u2014 has experienced a strong fallback in the spreading of CCS technologies. This is mostly related to economic problems in Europe and low carbon prices. Nevertheless, the rest of the World \u2014 e.g. the United States, Australia and China \u2014 has made notable technological progress with CCS. It is this uneven development of CCS that has led to significantly louder demand for a standardized registry indicating the potential storage on a global scale. The demand has also motivated several organizations operating on an international; level to develop registry systems for potential storage sites. These registry systems are quite similar to those which have been used for hydrocarbons for several decades now; this is due to the fact that most of the applied technology \u2014 as well as the potential storage sites themselves \u2014 are similar. However, there are still some specific characteristics of carbon storage that trammel the general use of some of the definitions applied to hydrocarbons. This paper deals with the presentation of some of the registry systems developed for carbon geological storage over recent decades. The present study focuses mainly on the most complex system proposed by the SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers). The last part of the paper attempts to classify potential storage sites in Hungary, in line with the SPE system. (It should be noted that the United Nations Framework Classification \u2014 UNFC \u2014 has produced Draft Specifications for the Application of UNFC-2009 to Injection Projects for the Purpose of Geological Storage. However, owing to the fact that the content of this classification has not yet been finalized, it is not dealt with here.)", "year": 2016}]}
