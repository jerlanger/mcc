Almost all EMF27 mitigation scenarios show a strong increase in renewable power production, with a substantial ramp-up of wind and solar power deployment. In many scenarios, renewables are the most important long-term mitigation option for power supply.

One option, Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), is prominent in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), with projected annual contributions of 8\u201316.5 GtCO2 per year of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal whilst contributing 150\u2013300 EJ per year, or 14 to 20% of global primary energy supply, in 2100. Implicit in these scenarios is the assumption that BECCS is a net producer of energy. However, relatively energy intensive biomass supply chains and low power generation efficiency could challenge this ubiquitous assumption. Deploying an energy negative technology at this scale could thus represent a threat to energy security. In this contribution, we evaluate the energy return on investment (EROI) of an archetypal BECCS facility. In order to highlight the importance of biomass sourcing, two feedstock scenarios are considered: use of domestic biomass pellets (UK) and import of biomass pellets from Louisiana, USA. We use the Modelling and Optimisation of Negative Emissions Technologies (MONET) framework to explicitly account for growing, pre-treating, transporting and converting the feedstock in a 500 MW BECCS facility. As an example, we illustrate how the net electricity balance (NElB) of a UK-based BECCS facility can be either positive or negative, as a function of supply chain decisions. Power plant efficiency, fuel efficiency for transport, transport distance, moisture content, drying method, as well as yield were identified as key factors that need to be carefully managed to maximise BECCS net electricity balance. A key insight of this contribution is that, given an annual carbon removal target, increasing BECCS' power generation efficiency by using a more advanced biomass conversion and CO2 capture technology could improve BECCS net electricity balance, but at the cost of increasing the amount of BECCS capacity required to meet this target.

The existing and under-development technologies for CO2 utilization in the world are briefly reviewed. Two categories, direct utilization of CO2 and conversion of CO2 to chemicals and energy products, are used to classify different forms of CO2 utilization. Regarding the direct utilization of CO2, in addition to its use in soft drinks, welding, foaming, and propellants, as well as the use of supercritical CO2 as a solvent, CO2 capture via photosynthesis to directly fix carbon into microalgae has also attracted the attention of researchers. The conversion of CO2 into chemicals and energy products via this approach is a promising way to not only reduce the CO2 emissions, but also generate more economic value.

Losses of C from the terrestrial ecosystems are exacerbated by deforestation, biomass burning, plowing, resource-based and subsistence agriculture, and practices that mine soil fertility and deplete the soil organic C (SOC) pool. Biomass burning may also produce charcoal, which is an inert carbon with long residence time.

In this paper, we investigate two land-based climate change mitigation strategies for carbon removal: (1) afforestation and (2) bioenergy in combination with carbon capture and storage technology (bioenergy CCS). In our approach, a global tax on GHG emissions aimed at ambitious climate change mitigation incentivizes land-based mitigation by penalizing positive and rewarding negative CO2 emissions from the land-use system. We analyze afforestation and bioenergy CCS as standalone and combined mitigation strategies. We find that afforestation is a cost-efficient strategy for carbon removal at relatively low carbon prices, while bioenergy CCS becomes competitive only at higher prices. According to our results, cumulative carbon removal due to afforestation and bioenergy CCS is similar at the end of 21st century (600\u2013700 GtCO2), while land-demand for afforestation is much higher compared to bioenergy CCS. In the combined setting, we identify competition for land, but the impact on the mitigation potential (1000 GtCO2) is partially alleviated by productivity increases in the agricultural sector. Moreover, our results indicate that early-century afforestation presumably will not negatively impact carbon removal due to bioenergy CCS in the second half of the 21st century. A sensitivity analysis shows that land-based mitigation is very sensitive to different levels of GHG taxes.

These benefits, however, come with increased CO2 emissions unless carbon capture and storage (CCS) is applied in SNG production. Even with CCS, SNG has higher CO2 emissions than conventional natural gas. In the United States, increases in natural gas supplies have been primarily deployed to the power sector. In China, however, due to inefficient and uncontrolled coal combustion in households, we find that allocating currently available SNG to the residential sector provides the largest air quality and health benefits and smallest climate penalties compared with allocation to the power or industrial sectors. Facing severe air pollution and growing dependence on natural gas imports, the Chinese government plans to increase coal-based synthetic natural gas (SNG) production. Although displacement of coal with SNG benefits air quality, it increases CO2 emissions. Due to variations in air pollutant and CO2 emission factors and energy efficiencies across sectors, coal replacement with SNG results in varying degrees of air quality benefits and climate penalties. We estimate air quality, human health, and climate impacts of SNG substitution strategies in 2020. Using all production of SNG in the residential sector results in an annual decrease of \u223c32,000 (20,000 to 41,000) outdoor-air-pollution-associated premature deaths, with ranges determined by the low and high estimates of the health risks. If changes in indoor/household air pollution were also included, the decrease would be far larger. SNG deployment in the residential sector results in nearly 10 and 60 times greater reduction in premature mortality than if it is deployed in the industrial or power sectors, respectively.

This study\n \u2022 presents the first high-level screening of CO2 storage sites available to Scotland\n \u2022 evaluates the means by which CO2 can be transported from power plants and other industrial activities to storage sites, and\n \u2022 investigates the costs and business constraints.\n This is the most comprehensive and fully integrated study performed in the UK, and was achieved by a collaborative partnership of Scottish Government, research universities and institutes, and a broad base of support from industry and business.\n The conclusions show that Scotland has an extremely large CO2 storage resource. This is overwhelmingly in offshore saline aquifers (deeply buried porous sandstones filled with salt water) together with a few specific depleted hydrocarbon fields. The resource can easily accommodate the industrial CO2 emissions from Scotland for the next 200 years. There is very likely to be sufficient storage to allow import of CO2 from NE England, this equating to over 25% of future UK large industry and power CO2 output. Preliminary indications are\n that Scotland's offshore CO2 storage capacity is very important on a European scale, comparable with that of offshore Norway, and greater than Netherlands, Denmark and Germany combined.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "ec7e2ec7ef888bb50d2fe86eb0378b7abbf666d1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2809010055", "DOI": "10.1017/sus.2018.3", "CorpusId": 59365677}, "title": "Challenges to the use of BECCS as a keystone technology in pursuit of 1.5\u2070C", "abstract": "Non-technical summary Biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is represented in many integrated assessment models as a keystone technology in delivering the Paris Agreement on climate change. This paper explores six key challenges in relation to large scale BECCS deployment and considers ways to address these challenges. Research needs to consider how BECCS fits in the context of other mitigation approaches, how it can be accommodated within existing policy drivers and goals, identify where it fits within the wider socioeconomic landscape, and ensure that genuine net negative emissions can be delivered on a global scale. Technical summary The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement sets a goal of limiting the global temperature increase to \u201cwell below 2\u00b0C\u201d and to pursue \u201cefforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C\u201d. Most emission pathways that are compatible with these goals are heavily reliant on negative emissions technologies (NETs), especially biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), at a global scale to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The use of negative emissions in climate mitigation introduces a complex variety of technologies whose desirability, effectiveness and viability remain highly uncertain. This paper explores six key policy and governance challenges associated with BECCS, suggesting ways in which research could address some of these challenges: 1) How does BECCS fit with carbon budgets? 2) How negative is BECCS? 3) Can BECCS be delivered at sufficient scale? 4) Can sufficient biomass be provided sustainably? 5) How does BECCS fit into the policy context? 6) How does BECCS fit with climate agreements? Consideration of these challenges highlights the importance of a whole systems approach to assessing the use of BECCS and its potential as a keystone technology to deliver negative emissions.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "0f291afd9471cff6a6f01525cc6565217f38aa6d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2793294556", "DOI": "10.1021/ACS.JPCC.8B00109", "CorpusId": 104013751}, "title": "Electrochemical Reduction of CO2 Mediated by Quinone Derivatives: Implication for Li\u2013CO2 Battery", "abstract": "The pivotal role of CO2 played in global temperature cycles has motivated the ongoing research on carbon capture and storage (CCS).

High capital costs, expressed as high weighted average cost of capital (WACC), thus tend to encourage the use of fossil fuels. To achieve the same degree of decarbonization, countries with high capital costs therefore need to impose a higher price on carbon emissions than countries with low capital costs. This is particularly relevant for developing and emerging economies, where capital costs tend to be higher than in rich countries. In this paper we quantitatively evaluate how high capital costs impact the transformation of the energy system under climate policy, applying a numerical techno-economic model of the power system. We find that high capital costs can significantly reduce the effectiveness of carbon prices: if carbon emissions are priced at USD 50 per ton and the WACC is 3%, the cost-optimal electricity mix comprises 40% renewable energy. At the same carbon price and a WACC of 15%, the cost-optimal mix comprises almost no renewable energy. At 15% WACC, there is no significant emission mitigation with carbon pricing up to USD 50 per ton, but at 3% WACC and the same carbon price, emissions are reduced by almost half.

All the aforementioned approaches are based on various physical and chemical phenomena including absorption, adsorption, and cryogenic capture of CO2. The purified carbon dioxide is sent for the physical storage options afterwards, using the earth as a gigantic reservoir with unknown long-term environmental impacts as well as possible hazards associated with that. Consequently, the ultimate solution for the CO2 sequestration is the chemical transformation of this stable molecule to useful products such as fuels (through, for example, Fischer\u2013Tropsch chemistry) or polymers (through successive copolymerization and chain growth). This sustainably reduces carbon emissions, taking full advantage of CO2-derived chemical commodities, so-called carbon capture and conversion. Nevertheless, the surface chemistry of CO2 reduction is a challenge due to the presence of large energy barriers, requiring noticeable catalysis. This work aims to review the most recent advances in this concept selectively (CO2 conversion to fuels and CO2 copolymerization) with chemical engineering approach in terms of both materials and process design.

The results show that systems based largely on VRE perform much better regarding climate change and other impact categories than the investigated systems based on fossil fuels. The climate change impacts from Europe for the year 2050 in a scenario using primarily natural gas are 1400 Tg CO2-eq while in a scenario using mostly coal with CCS the impacts are 480 Tg CO2-eq.

We apply the integrated assessment framework REMIND-MAgPIE to show that bioenergy, particularly if combined with carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a crucial mitigation option with high deployment levels and high technology value. If CCS is available, bioenergy is exclusively used with CCS. We find that the ability of bioenergy to provide negative emissions gives rise to a strong nexus between biomass prices and carbon prices. Ambitious climate policy could result in bioenergy prices of 70 $/GJ (or even 430 $/GJ if bioenergy potential is limited to 100 EJ/year), which indicates a strong demand for bioenergy. For low stabilization scenarios with BECCS availability, we find that the carbon value of biomass tends to exceed its pure energy value. Therefore, the driving factor behind investments into bioenergy conversion capacities for electricity and hydrogen production are the revenues generated from negative emissions, rather than from energy production. However, in REMIND modern bioenergy is predominantly used to produce low-carbon fuels, since the transport sector has significantly fewer low-carbon alternatives to biofuels than the power sector. Since negative emissions increase the amount of permissible emissions from fossil fuels, given a climate target, bioenergy acts as a complement to fossils rather than a substitute.

Biofuels produced from microalgae are a particularly attractive option since microalgae have production potentials that exceed the best terrestrial crops by 2 to 10-fold. In addition, autotrophically grown microalgae can capture CO2 from point sources reducing direct atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions. The enhanced biomass production potential of algae is attributed in part to the fact that every cell is photosynthetic. Regardless, overall biological energy capture, conversion, and storage in microalgae are inefficient with less than 8% conversion of solar into chemical energy achieved. In this review, we examine the thermodynamic and kinetic constraints associated with the autotrophic conversion of inorganic carbon into storage carbohydrate and oil, the dominant energy storage products in Chlorophytic microalgae. We discuss how thermodynamic restrictions including the loss of fixed carbon during acetyl CoA synthesis reduce the efficiency of carbon accumulation in lipids. In addition, kinetic limitations, such as the coupling of proton to electron transfer during plastoquinone reduction and oxidation and the slow rates of CO2 fixation by Rubisco reduce photosynthetic efficiency. In some cases, these kinetic limitations have been overcome by massive increases in the numbers of effective catalytic sites, e.g. the high Rubisco levels (mM) in chloroplasts. But in other cases, including the slow rate of plastoquinol oxidation, there has been no compensatory increase in the abundance of catalytically limiting protein complexes. Significantly, we show that the energetic requirements for producing oil and starch relative to the recoverable energy stored in these molecules are very similar on a per carbon basis. Presently, the overall rates of starch and lipid synthesis in microalgae are very poorly characterized.

Such an approach does not consider how patterns of nitrogen allocation may change with differences in light intensity, growing-season temperature and CO2 concentration. To account for this known variability in nitrogen-photosynthesis relationships, we develop a mechanistic nitrogen allocation model based on a trade-off of nitrogen allocated between growth and storage, and an optimization of nitrogen allocated among light capture, electron transport, carboxylation, and respiration. The developed model is able to predict the acclimation of photosynthetic capacity to changes in CO2 concentration, temperature, and radiation when evaluated against published data of Vc,max (maximum carboxylation rate) and Jmax (maximum electron transport rate). A sensitivity analysis of the model for herbaceous plants, deciduous and evergreen trees implies that elevated CO2 concentrations lead to lower allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation but higher allocation to storage. Higher growing-season temperatures cause lower allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation, due to higher nitrogen requirements for light capture pigments and for storage. Lower levels of radiation have a much stronger effect on allocation of nitrogen to carboxylation for herbaceous plants than for trees, resulting from higher nitrogen requirements for light capture for herbaceous plants. As far as we know, this is the first model of complete nitrogen allocation that simultaneously considers nitrogen allocation to light capture, electron transport, carboxylation, respiration and storage, and the responses of each to altered environmental conditions.

CCS is routinely identified as a key factor in least-cost transitions to a low-carbon electricity system in 2050, one with significant value by providing dispatchable and low-carbon electricity. This paper investigates production, demand and stability characteristics of the current and future electricity system. We analyse the Carbon Intensity (CI) of electricity systems composed of unabated thermal (coal and gas), abated (CCS), and wind power plants for different levels of wind availability with a view to quantifying the value to the system of different generation mixes. As a thought experiment we consider the supply side of a UK-sized electricity system and compare the effect of combining wind and CCS capacity with unabated thermal power plants. The resulting capacity mix, system cost and CI are used to highlight the importance of differentiating between intermittent and firm low-carbon power generators. We observe that, in the absence of energy storage or demand side management, the deployment of intermittent renewable capacity cannot significantly displace unabated thermal power, and consequently can achieve only moderate reductions in overall CI. A system deploying sufficient wind capacity to meet peak demand can reduce CI from 0.78 tCO2/MWh, a level according to unabated fossil power generation, to 0.38 tCO2/MWh. The deployment of CCS power plants displaces unabated thermal plants, and whilst it is more costly than unabated thermal plus wind, this system can achieve an overall CI of 0.1 tCO2/MWh. The need to evaluate CCS using a systemic perspective in order to appreciate its unique value is a core conclusion of this study.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "c91107c05f28b93532d39a1894405d4e6fa147c9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2137546425", "DOI": "10.2172/821987", "CorpusId": 28070617}, "title": "ANALYSIS OF DEVONIAN BLACK SHALES IN KENTUCKY FOR POTENTIAL CARBON DIOXIDE SEQUESTRATION AND ENHANCED NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION", "abstract": "Devonian gas shales underlie approximately two-thirds of Kentucky.

Drill cuttings from the Kentucky Geological Survey Well Sample and Core Library were sampled to determine CO{sub 2} and CH{sub 4} adsorption isotherms. Sidewall core samples were acquired to investigate CO{sub 2} displacement of methane. An elemental capture spectroscopy log was acquired to investigate possible correlations between adsorption capacity and mineralogy.

Commercial applications of CO{sub 2} separation and capture technologies are found in a number of industrial process operations worldwide. Many of these capture technologies also are applicable to fossil fuel power plants, although applications to large-scale power generation remain to be demonstrated. This report describes the development of a generalized modeling framework to assess alternative CO{sub 2} capture and storage options in the context of multi-pollutant control requirements for fossil fuel power plants. The focus of the report is on post-combustion CO{sub 2} capture using amine-based absorption systems at pulverized coal-fired plants, which are the most prevalent technology used for power generation today. The modeling framework builds on the previously developed Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM). The expanded version with carbon sequestration is designated as IECM-cs. The expanded modeling capability also includes natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants and integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) systems as well as pulverized coal (PC) plants. This report presents details of the performance and cost models developed for an amine-based CO{sub 2} capture system, representing the baseline of current commercial technology. The key uncertainties and variability in process design, performance and cost parameters which influence the overall cost of carbon mitigation also are characterized. The new performance and cost models for CO{sub 2} capture systems have been integrated into the IECM-cs, along with models to estimate CO{sub 2} transport and storage costs. The CO{sub 2} control system also interacts with other emission control technologies such as flue gas desulfurization (FGD) systems for SO{sub 2} control. The integrated model is applied to study the feasibility and cost of carbon capture and sequestration at both new and existing PC plants as well as new NGCC plants. The cost of CO{sub 2} avoidance using amine-based CO{sub 2} capture technology is found to be sensitive to assumptions about the reference plant design and operation, as well as assumptions about the CO{sub 2} capture system design. The case studies also reveal multi-pollutant interactions and potential tradeoffs in the capture of CO{sub 2}, SO{sub 2}, NO{sub 2} and NH{sub 3}. The potential for targeted R&D to reduce the cost of CO{sub 2} capture also is explored using the IECM-cs in conjunction with expert elicitations regarding potential improvements in key performance and cost parameters of amine-based systems. The results indicate that the performance of amine-based CO{sub 2} capture systems can be improved significantly, and the cost of CO{sub 2} capture reduced substantially over the next decade or two, via innovations such as new or improved sorbents with lower regeneration heat requirements, and improvements in power plant heat integration to reduce the (currently large) energy penalty of CO{sub 2} capture. Future work will explore in more detail a broader set of advanced technology options to lower the costs of CO{sub 2} capture and storage.

Land management for carbon storage is discussed as being indispensable for climate change mitigation because of its large potential to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and to avoid further emissions from deforestation. However, the acceptance and feasibility of land-based mitigation projects depends on potential side effects on other important ecosystem functions and their services. Here, we use projections of future land use and land cover for different land-based mitigation options from two land-use models (IMAGE and MAgPIE) and evaluate their effects with a global dynamic vegetation model (LPJ-GUESS). In the land-use models, carbon removal was achieved either via growth of bioenergy crops combined with carbon capture and storage, via avoided deforestation and afforestation, or via a combination of both. We compare these scenarios to a reference scenario without land-based mitigation and analyse the LPJ-GUESS simulations with the aim of assessing synergies and trade-offs across a range of ecosystem service indicators: carbon storage, surface albedo, evapotranspiration, water runoff, crop production, nitrogen loss, and emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds. In our mitigation simulations cumulative carbon storage by year 2099 ranged between 55 and 89\u202fGtC. Other ecosystem service indicators were influenced heterogeneously both positively and negatively, with large variability across regions and land-use scenarios. Avoided deforestation and afforestation led to an increase in evapotranspiration and enhanced emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds, and to a decrease in albedo, runoff, and nitrogen loss. Crop production could also decrease in the afforestation scenarios as a result of reduced crop area, especially for MAgPIE land-use patterns, if assumed increases in crop yields cannot be realized. Bioenergy-based climate change mitigation was projected to affect less area globally than in the forest expansion scenarios, and resulted in less pronounced changes in most ecosystem service indicators than forest-based mitigation, but included a possible decrease in nitrogen loss, crop production, and biogenic volatile organic compounds emissions.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "9bc85f268d32d45918b72fa92195fa5d8cbe866a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2152787650", "DOI": "10.1146/annurev-chembioeng-062011-081008", "CorpusId": 30886157, "PubMed": "22483264"}, "title": "Experimental methods for phase equilibria at high pressures.", "abstract": "Knowledge of high-pressure phase equilibria is crucial in many fields, e.g., for the design and optimization of high-pressure chemical and separation processes, carbon capture and storage, hydrate formation, applications of ionic liquids, and geological processes.

The objective of this Assessment was to determine the technical and economic feasibility of using these geological sinks for long-term storage to avoid atmospheric release of CO{sub 2} from fossil fuel combustion and thereby avoid the potential for adverse climate change.

The Illinois Basin region has annual emissions from stationary anthropogenic sources exceeding 276 million metric tonnes (304 million tons) of CO{sub 2} (>70 million tonnes (77 million tons) carbon equivalent), primarily from coal-fired electric generation facilities, some of which burn almost 4.5 million tonnes (5 million tons) of coal per year.

Understanding the Role of CCS Deployment in Meeting Ambitious Climate Goals", "abstract": "Meeting the ambitious long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement necessitates far-reaching changes in the global energy system and economy. Understanding both physical constraints on this transition, as well as economic constraints on the deployment of various technologies, can help to assess what role carbon capture and storage (CCS) can play in achieving this transition over the remainder of the century. This chapter reviews the necessary physical climate science to understand the role of CCS in limiting warming. We describe how the concept of a finite \u201ccarbon budget\u201d arises out of interactions between the carbon-cycle and the rest of the climate system. A clear physically-based requirement for achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement is the necessity of reaching global net-zero carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Based on this insight, we undertake a high-level but informative decomposition of Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) emissions reduction scenarios into contributions arising from the substitution of demand for carbon dioxide, and from the sequestration of carbon dioxide. In all scenarios that allow for the availability of CCS, the cost-effective solution offsets 20% or greater of business-as-usual end-of-century CO2 emissions with CCS and/or negative emissions technologies. We highlight the need for the sequestered fraction of extracted carbon, a potentially useful climate policy measure, to rise to reach unity in order to limit warming to any value and describe a near-term schedule for increases in this fraction compatible with IAM-simulated cost-effective pathways that succeed in meeting the Paris Agreement long-term temperature goal.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "4603458ad5ad95c9ce5cdaa4c2ca464b5f569ce5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2922209612", "DOI": "10.1088/1361-6501/AB1025", "CorpusId": 127090871}, "title": "Localization of CO2 gas leakages through acoustic emission multi-sensor fusion based on wavelet-RBFN modeling", "abstract": "CO2 leakage from transmission pipelines in carbon capture and storage systems may seriously endanger the ecological environment and human health.

In this study, a novel method based on the combination of a wavelet packet algorithm and a radial basis function network (RBFN) is proposed to realize the leak location. Multiple acoustic emission (AE) sensors are first deployed to collect leakage signals of CO2 pipelines. The characteristics of the leakage signals from the AE sensors under different pressures are then analyzed in both time and frequency domains. Further, leakage signals are decomposed into three layers using wavelet decomposition theory. Wavelet packet energy and maximum value, and time difference calculated by cross-correlation are selected as the input feature vectors of the RBFN.

However, there are challenges for widespread implementation including the need to develop mineralization process routes for permanent carbon storage. Mineral carbonation of highly reactive feedstocks may be limited by the supply rate of CO2. This rate limitation can be directly addressed by incorporating enzyme-catalyzed CO2 hydration. This study examined the effects of bovine carbonic anhydrase (BCA) and CO2-rich gas streams on the carbonation rate of brucite [Mg(OH)2], a highly reactive mineral. Alkaline brucite slurries were amended with BCA and supplied with 10% CO2 gas while aqueous chemistry and solids were monitored throughout the experiments (hours to days). In comparison to controls, brucite carbonation using BCA was accelerated by up to 240%. Nesquehonite [MgCO3\u00b73H2O] precipitation limited the accumulation of hydrated CO2 species, apparently preventing BCA from catalyzing the dehydration reaction.

By deliberately integrating trees with crop-and animal-production systems, agroforestry systems offer a promising avenue for C storage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in several of the managed terrestrial ecosystems around the world. Exploitation of mechanisms such as nutrient cycling, nitrogen fixation by tree legumes, and deep-capture of nutrients by deep-rooted tree components offers a distinct possibility for reducing agrochemical inputs to these systems, yet maintaining the system productivity at reasonable levels on a sustained basis. Furthermore, with the emphasis on fruit trees and other multipurpose trees that provide multiple products and services, the proportion of total photosynthates that is removed from the system is minimized, thereby facilitating storage of more C in the system than in conventional, clear-cut silvicultural systems. Examples of management opportunities in agroforestry for better C sequestration include adoption of \u201cgreen\u201d technologies such as return of biomass and plant residues to fields, providing vegetative barriers and canopy cover on soil surface to reduce soil erosion, and reclaiming degraded lands such as salt-affected and eroded soils through tree planting. The extent of and possibility for agroforestry vary in different parts of the world. Alley cropping and improved fallow systems are good examples of intensive biomassmanagement systems in the tropics, whereas shaded perennial and silvopastoral systems represent situations with permanent tree cover. The five recognized agroforestry systems in the temperate region-alley cropping, forest farming, riparian buffer, silvopasture, and windbreaks-vary greatly in their C storage potential. Although trees are good C sinks, the relationship between tree planting and C sequestration is not a simple one. Estimates of C sequestration from terrestrial ecosystems are based on models extrapolated from experimental data, monitoring of changes in atmospheric CO2, and remote sensing using satellite imagery to detect changes in land-use practices. Each of these methods has drawbacks. The situation is more complex in the case of agroforestry systems, on which neither reliable statistics on the extent of area, nor rigorous C sequestration data under filed conditions exist. Furthermore, while theoretical or experimental data are useful for predicting effects of agroforestry in C sequestration, economic realities are a major factor in determining actual as opposed to potential amounts stored. Thus, although agroforestry systems seem to have high potential for C sequestration, considerable effort is needed in realistically assessing the magnitude of this potential as well as realizing it.

To develop the capture technology from its current early pilot phase towards commercial maturity, significant public and private funding is directed towards R&D projects and pilot power plants. However, we know little about how this funding relates to the economics of CCS power plants and their market diffusion. This paper addresses that question. We initially review past learning effects from both capacity installations and R&D efforts for a similar technology, flue-gas desulfurization, using the concept of two-factor learning, and estimate the learning curve. We apply the obtained learning-by-doing rate of 7.1% and the learning-by-researching rate of 6.6% to CCS in the electricity market model HECTOR, which simulates 19 European countries hourly until 2040, to understand the impact of learning and associated policies on the market diffusion of CCS. Simulation results show that the individual impact of learning is similar for both learning rates, regardless of the CO2 price. We then evaluate the effectiveness of policies subsidizing CCS investment costs (addressing learning-by-doing) and of policies providing R&D grants (addressing learning-by-researching) by relating the policy budget to the realized CCS capacity. We find that policies promoting diffusion through subsidies are, at lower policy cost, about equally effective as policies providing R&D funding. At higher spending levels, diffusion-promoting policies are more effective. Overall, policy effectiveness increases in low CO2 price scenarios, but the CO2 price still remains the key prerequisite for the economic competitiveness of CCS, even with major policy support.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "b675c8d07100b4b69f816eea4e3cd01403fb9c48", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2087327731", "DOI": "10.1039/C4TA02782E", "CorpusId": 98213870}, "title": "Remarkable Gas Adsorption by Carbonized Nitrogen-Rich Hypercrosslinked Porous Organic Polymers", "abstract": "A series of carbonized materials was obtained using nitrogen-rich hypercrosslinked porous organic polymer as the precursor by high-temperature treatment with/without potassium hydroxide activation.

Without new storage technologies that can overcome this intermittency, much of the decarbonization of the economy will have to come from nuclear, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and energy efficiency (geothermal and biofuels can make small contributions).

However, with global issues like climate change at the forefront of public attention there is a trend towards the development of a carbon constrained economy. As a result, research has intensified in the last decade on modes of operating coal fired power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS). In particular, pre-combustion options via coal gasification, especially integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) processes, are attracting the attention of governments, industry and the research community as an attractive alternative to conventional power generation. It is possible to build an IGCC plant with CCS with conventional technologies however; these processes are energy intensive and likely to reduce power plant efficiencies. Novel ceramic membrane technologies, in particular molecular sieving silica (MSS) and pervoskite membranes, offer the opportunity to reduce efficiency losses by separating gases at high temperatures and pressures. MSS membranes can be made preferentially selective for H2, enabling both enhanced production, via a water\u2013gas shift membrane reactor, and recovery of H2 from the syngas stream at high temperatures. They also allow CO2 to be concentrated at high pressures, reducing the compression loads for transportation and enabling simple integration with CO2 storage or sequestration operations. Perovskite membranes provide a viable alternative to cryogenic distillation for air separation by delivering the tonnage of oxygen required for coal gasification at a reduced cost.

The level of political and industrial support and social protest played a key role in building project legitimacy, while the types of narratives and their credibility determined the distinct trajectories of hydraulic fracturing and carbon capture and storage in France. The conflicts over enhanced oil recovery techniques are also explained through the critical assessment of the governance framework that tends to exclude civil society stakeholders.

CO2 dissolution into saline water enhances long-term storage security, but dissolution rates are too slow to be quantified during injection pilots. Therefore, we estimate dissolution rates over millennial timescales at the Bravo Dome gas field, a natural analog for geological CO2 storage. We show that 1.6 Gt CO2 have been stored at Bravo Dome since the beginning of CO2 emplacement 1.2\u20131.5 Ma. Approximately 10% of the CO2 dissolved during its emplacement, while another 10% dissolved into the underlying aquifer. This exceeds the amount expected from diffusion and provides field evidence for convective CO2 dissolution. The convective dissolution rate, however, is slow in typical US aquifers. The injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) captured at large point sources into deep saline aquifers can significantly reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions from fossil fuels. Dissolution of the injected CO2 into the formation brine is a trapping mechanism that helps to ensure the long-term security of geological CO2 storage. We use thermochronology to estimate the timing of CO2 emplacement at Bravo Dome, a large natural CO2 field at a depth of 700 m in New Mexico. Together with estimates of the total mass loss from the field we present, to our knowledge, the first constraints on the magnitude, mechanisms, and rates of CO2 dissolution on millennial timescales. Apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronology records heating of the Bravo Dome reservoir due to the emplacement of hot volcanic gases 1.2\u20131.5 Ma. The CO2 accumulation is therefore significantly older than previous estimates of 10 ka, which demonstrates that safe long-term geological CO2 storage is possible. Integrating geophysical and geochemical data, we estimate that 1.3 Gt CO2 are currently stored at Bravo Dome, but that only 22% of the emplaced CO2 has dissolved into the brine over 1.2 My. Roughly 40% of the dissolution occurred during the emplacement. The CO2 dissolved after emplacement exceeds the amount expected from diffusion and provides field evidence for convective dissolution with a rate of 0.1 g/(m2y).

To study lethal effects on marine organisms attributable to CO2 seawater acidification, a bubbling CO2 system was designed enabling a battery of different tests to be conducted, under laboratory conditions, employing various pH treatments (8.0, 7.5, 7.0, 6.5, 6.0, and 5.5). Assays were performed of three exposure routes (seawater, whole sediment, and sediment elutriate). Individuals of the clam (Ruditapes philippinarum) and early-life stages of the gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, were exposed for 10\u00a0days and 72\u00a0h, respectively, to acidified clean seawater. S. aurata larvae were also exposed to acidified elutriate samples, and polychaete organisms of the specie Hediste diversicolor and clams R. philippinarum were also exposed for 10\u00a0days to estuarine whole sediment. In the fish larvae elutriate test, 100\u00a0% mortality was recorded at pH\u00a06.0, after 48\u00a0h of exposure. Similar results were obtained in the clam sediment exposure test. In the other organisms, significant mortality (p\u2009<\u20090.05) was observed at pH values lower than 6.0. Very high lethal effects (calculating L[H+]50, defined as the H+ concentration that causes lethal effects in 50\u00a0% of the population exposed) were detected in association with the lowest pH treatment for all the species. The implication of these results is that a severe decrease of seawater pH would cause high mortality in marine organisms of several different kinds and life stages.

The reduction in cost requires adsorbents with high capacities for CO(2) sorption and high CO(2)-over-N(2) selectivity. Amine-modified sorbents are promising candidates for carbon capture. To investigate the details of CO(2) adsorption in such materials, we studied mesocaged (cubic, Pm3n symmetry) silica adsorbents with tethered propylamines using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and volumetric uptake experiments. The degree of heterogeneity in these coatings was varied by either cosynthesizing or postsynthetically introducing the propylamine modification. In situ FTIR spectroscopy revealed the presence of both physisorbed and chemisorbed CO(2) in the materials. We present direct molecular evidence for physisorption using FTIR spectroscopy in mesoporous silica sorbents modified with propylamines. Physisorption reduced the CO(2)-over-N(2) selectivity in amine-rich sorbents. Samples with homogeneous coatings showed typical CO(2) adsorption trends and large quantities of IR-observable physisorbed CO(2). The uptake of CO(2) in mesocaged materials with heterogeneous propylamine coatings was higher at high temperatures than at low temperatures. At higher temperatures and low pressures, the postsynthetically modified materials adsorbed more CO(2) than did the extracted ones, even though the surface area after modification was clearly reduced and the coverage of primary amine groups was lower. The principal mode of CO(2) uptake in postsynthetically modified mesoporous silica was chemisorption. The chemisorbed moieties were present mainly as carbamate-ammonium ion pairs, resulting from the quantitative transformation of primary amine groups during CO(2) adsorption as established by NIR spectroscopy. The heterogeneity in the coatings promoted the formation of these ion pairs. The average propylamine-propylamine distance must be small to allow the formation of carbamate-propylammonium ion pairs.", "year": 2010}]}
