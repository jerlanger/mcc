The Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) may be a temporary solution for this problem. CCS is the technology when the CO2is separated from the local CO2 sources, and is injected at least 800\u20131000 m deep where, because of the high pressure and higher than ambient temperature, it will be supercritical (scCO2). We need to study what are the geochemical changes induced by scCO2 to use safely this technology. This was the main motive why we started to make experimental and analytical methods on real core samples from exploration drilling. We added scCO2 to sandstone core samples in brine and very high purity calcite samples in 5 w/w% NaClsolution in 70\u2013220 bar pressure interval and in 55\u201365 \u00b0C temperature interval in a high pressure resistant bomb and autoclave. After experiments the brine and solution samples were analyzed by ICP-MS and the core samples by XRF and SEM. The results indicated significant alteration in the concentration of Na, Ca, Mg, K, Fe and Srions concentration before and after the addition of scCO2. After adding scCO2the concentration of Ca grew in the brine and was reduced on the surface of the sandstone. The XRF results indicated a very high dispersion of the elements on the surface of the samples.

These innovative mixed-methods provide insights into how to advance individual and social learning. Results of comparative case study analysis provide strong support for renewables and illustrate place-based differences. All communities supported renewable sources. The community in proximity to coal, oil, and gas production supported coal, and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and was concerned with the social cost of job loss on the welfare system; engaging the public was not a priority. In contrast, the other two communities stressed the importance of engaging the public and considering all costs, risks, benefits across the entire lifespan of power production sources. To achieve future sustainability, policy implications include addressing important concerns of resource-dependent communities, namely job loss, and conducting holistic policy assessment of potential power production sources that account for carbon and cost across the entire supply chain and include land-use change.", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "7d2fce7d9da0689ebd3cc4cd9908eaf717b85ffd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1495703133", "CorpusId": 106684944}, "title": "Offshore petroleum and minerals: Plugging gaps in the present framework", "abstract": "For twenty years, it has been realized that there is a gap in New Zealand\u2019s environmental law in that there is no general environmental legislation for the exclusive economic zone, and now for the extended continental shelf that includes areas more than 200 nautical miles offshore. The jurisdiction of regional councils under the Resource Management Act 1991 does not extend beyond the 12-mile limit, about 22 km offshore. (The jurisdiction of territorial authorities extends only to the mean low water mark.) That has meant that oil and gas operations beyond the 12-mile limit have not had proper environmental scrutiny. Public concern about such matters has sharpened in the light of petroleum exploration in the Raukumara Basin off the East Cape, although so far it has only reached the stage of seismic exploration. The Deepwater Horizon blowout on the Macondo prospect in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 also looms large in public debate. With a lower profile but with a similar potential to cause environmental harm is the possibility of seabed mining operations. A company is gearing up for deep seabed mining off New Britain in Papua New Guinea. Globally, the main targets are cobalt-rich crusts, polymetallic nodules (on the abyssal plain), and massive sulphide deposits (near hydrothermal vents). In New Zealand iron sands are also attractive. Other possible future uses of the offshore are carbon capture and storage and the extraction of gas hydrates. Existing operations such as fishing by bottom trawling present risks of environmental harm to the benthic environment, especially to features such as seamounts. 1 The Minister for the Environment has now announced his intention to introduce a bill to plug this legal gap, at least in relation to petroleum development and seabed mining. Action on this is most welcome. It is desirable to consider the strengths and weaknesses of the proposal, and of the legal framework for oil and gas well drilling in general.

CO2 capture and storage methods have been perceived as favourable solutions to prevent global warming and climate change rising from the greenhouse effect. One energy efficient technology for separating CO2 is the development of high-performing CO2 gas separating membranes. A variety of membrane-based gas separation technologies designed have shown promising results and are inexpensive. A high-performing membrane must have a defect-free, thin dense skin-layer with a porous sub-layer for support that permits great permeation rate and selectivity. Of all ranges of polymers used to make polymeric membranes for CO2/nitrogen (N2) separation, cellulose acetate (CA) polymer membranes are known for their high CO2 solubility. In this research, the effect of CA polymer concentrations at low acetyl group of 39.8% and casting thickness on the structure and morphologies of the membranes were studied. The CA polymer concentration was optimised from a range of 10 wt%, 15 wt% and 20 wt%, and the casting thickness was optimised from a range of 150 \u03bcm to 400 \u03bcm using wet-phase inversion technique.

The successful realization of H2-CCS integrated chains requires the mobilization of vast quantities of domestic and international private capital. This article looks at how legislation and contracts, separately and in combination, can be used to manage and mitigate risks and incentivise private sector investment along the H2-CCS value chain in Europe. First, it discusses the role of national governments and the EU in developing legislative measures such as climate change targets, market design, liability regimes and how those could remove some of the risks preventing private sector investments. Second, it considers how the design and standardization of contracts can mitigate risks faced by the private sector by allocating, transferring and sharing risks between private and public parties. The article concludes that the law has an important role in de-risking investments and that further policy steps are necessary to refine the legislative and contractual regimes needed for the successful deployment of such strategic value chains.\nCCS, climate change, hydrogen, de-risking, legislation, contract, risk mitigation, risk allocation, risk transfer, public-private partnerships.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "6c16e3db448dc628f5bf039929d9db1432108a1f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2613239370", "DOI": "10.1051/EPJCONF/201714302141", "CorpusId": 37009536}, "title": "Temperature and pressure correlation for volume of gas hydrates with crystal structures sI and sII", "abstract": "The temperature and pressure correlations for the volume of gas hydrates forming crystal structures sI and sII developed in previous study [Fluid Phase Equilib. 427 (2016) 268-281], focused on the modeling of pure gas hydrates relevant in CCS (carbon capture and storage), were revised and modified for the modeling of mixed hydrates in this study.

The study utilized dataset stretching between 1990 and 2018 to investigate this interrelationship in the BRICS nations. The results generated from the MMQR mimic those of the three heterogeneous linear panel estimation techniques conducted (for robustness check), in terms of coefficient sign, magnitude, and significance. Using the MMQR technique, empirical results show that across quantiles (0.1\u20130.90), political risk, economic growth, and globalization positively affects environmental degradation. Renewable energy consumption, on the other hand, curb environmental degradation across all quantiles (0.10\u20130.90).

A thermodynamic analysis regarding the hydrogenation of CO2 into CH4 or CH3OH was carried out. The analysis was performed to check the limitations and optimal conditions when converting CO2 from flue gas exhaust streams without previous removal of unnecessary species present in significant amounts (e.g. N2, H2O and O2).

This is typically conducted by measuring CO 2 flux at numerous points over a large area and applying statistics or geostatistical interpolation. Accuracy of the results will depend on many factors related to survey/data-processing choices and site characteristics, and thus uncertainties can be difficult to quantify. To address this issue, we have developed a Monte Carlo-based program (MC-Flux) that repeatedly subsamples a high-resolution synthetic or real dataset using a choice of different sampling strategies (one random and four grid types) at multiple user-defined sample densities. The program keeps track of the anomalies found and estimates total flux using two statistical and two geostatistical approaches from the literature. This paper describes the use of MC-Flux to assess the potential impact of various sampling and interpretation decisions on the accuracy of the final results. Simulations show that an offset grid sample distribution yields the best results, however relatively dense sampling is required to obtain a high probability of an accurate flux estimate. For the test dataset used, ordinary kriging interpolation produces a range of flux estimates that are centered on the true value while sequential Gaussian simulation tends to slightly overestimate values at intermediate sample spacings and is sensitive to input parameters. These results point to the need for developing new approaches that decrease uncertainty, such as integration with high-resolution co-kriging datasets that complement the more accurate point flux measurements.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "bd40f32b1607e76b7a6dc530063b029c22800d82", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1558273256", "CorpusId": 128659165}, "title": "A synthesis of remote sensing tools to measure and monitor forest structure and carbon storage", "abstract": "The sustainable management of forest and woodland ecosystems requires practical ways of defining ecosystem services and economic values.

One of the concerns of geologic carbon sequestration is that injected CO{sub 2} may leak out of the intended storage formation, migrate to the near-surface environment, and seep out of the ground or into surface water. In this research, we investigate the process of CO{sub 2} leakage and seepage into saturated sediments and overlying surface water bodies such as rivers, lakes, wetlands, and continental shelf marine environments. Natural CO{sub 2} and CH{sub 4} fluxes are well studied and provide insight into the expected transport mechanisms and fate of seepage fluxes of similar magnitude. Also, natural CO{sub 2} and CH{sub 4} fluxes are pervasive in surface water environments at levels that may mask low-level carbon sequestration leakage and seepage. Extreme examples are the well known volcanic lakes in Cameroon where lake water supersaturated with respect to CO{sub 2} overturned and degassed with lethal effects. Standard bubble formation and hydrostatics are applicable to CO{sub 2} bubbles in surface water. Bubble-rise velocity in surface water is a function of bubble size and reaches a maximum of approximately 30 cm s{sup -1} at a bubblemore\u00a0\u00bb radius of 0.7 mm. Bubble rise in saturated porous media below surface water is affected by surface tension and buoyancy forces, along with the solid matrix pore structure. For medium and fine grain sizes, surface tension forces dominate and gas transport tends to occur as channel flow rather than bubble flow. For coarse porous media such as gravels and coarse sand, buoyancy dominates and the maximum bubble rise velocity is predicted to be approximately 18 cm s{sup -1}. Liquid CO{sub 2} bubbles rise slower in water than gaseous CO{sub 2} bubbles due to the smaller density contrast. A comparison of ebullition (i.e., bubble formation) and resulting bubble flow versus dispersive gas transport for CO{sub 2} and CH{sub 4} at three different seepage rates reveals that ebullition and bubble flow will be the dominant form of gas transport in surface water for all but the smallest seepage fluxes or shallowest water bodies. The solubility of the gas species in water plays a fundamental role in whether ebullition occurs. We used a solubility model to examine CO{sub 2} solubility in waters with varying salinity as a function of depth below a 200 m-deep surface water body. In this system, liquid CO{sub 2} is stable between the deep regions where supercritical CO{sub 2} is stable and the shallow regions where gaseous CO{sub 2} is stable. The transition from liquid to gaseous CO{sub 2} is associated with a large change in density, with corresponding large change in bubble buoyancy. The solubility of CO{sub 2} is lower in high-salinity waters such as might be encountered in the deep subsurface. Therefore, as CO{sub 2} migrates upward through the deep subsurface, it will likely encounter less saline water with increasing capacity to dissolve CO{sub 2} potentially preventing ebullition, depending on the CO{sub 2} leakage flux. However, as CO{sub 2} continues to move upward through shallower depths, CO{sub 2} solubility in water decreases strongly leading to greater likelihood of ebullition and bubble flow in surface water. In the case of deep density-stratified lakes in which ebullition is suppressed, enhanced mixing and man-made degassing schemes can alleviate the buildup of CO{sub 2} and related risk of dangerous rapid discharges. Future research efforts are needed to increase understanding of CO{sub 2} leakage and seepage in surface water and saturated porous media. For example, we recommend experiments and field tests of CO{sub 2} migration in saturated systems to formulate bubble-driven water-displacement models and relative permeability functions that can be used in simulation models.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "60a4a28482347d1f825f0b8f3ea95e4869c6f8bb", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 54713496}, "title": "Challenges in Capture Processes: The Way Forward", "abstract": "State-of-the-art CO2 capture processes lead to a reduction of power plant efficiency and an increase in electricity costs when used with the dilute streams of CO2 found in the flue gases from the current generation of fossil fuel power plant.

The chemical absorption of CO2 in mixed solvents (typically aqueous solution of alkanolamines [1]) is considered as a promising avenue for its capture before transportation and storage [2]. Research projects are developed in order to reduce the energy costs of the regeneration step in process working on absorption-desorption cycles. CO2 desorption requires substantial heating of the whole system containing the products resulting from chemical reactions of CO2. This presentation concerns the use of demixing amines to reduce of the energy involved in capture process. These amines show a liquid-liquid phase separation at moderately elevated temperatures [3]. Such a phase separation occurring at the output of the absorber unit will concentrate carbon in water rich phase that is the only part of the solvent that needs to be regenerated. The presentation will focus on the study of those phase separations for water + amine mixtures. It is proposed to investigate a group of piperidine derivatives and to analyse the effect of substitution in different positions on the ring. First measurements will also be reported for evaluating the influence of CO2 on the temperature of liquid-liquid phase separation. The phase diagrams will be obtained in combining two different methods. A microcalorimeter from setaram was used to determine the liquid-liquid separation temperature. The calorimeter is based on calvet principle and is able to operate in scanning temperature mode from 253 K to 393 K. it allows to measure the differential thermal flux between the measuring cell filled with the solution and the reference cell filled with water as reference fluid. The liquid-liquid separation temperature is determined by evaluating the first point when the thermal flux diverges from the baseline. Simultaneously to these calorimetric measurements, a phase equilibrium cell was developed to get optical information on the liquid-liquid separation. The binary solution was introduced in the cell, and the solution was observed during scanning of temperature. The scanning rate chosen was similar to calorimetric measurements in order to be able to compare directly the results. The separation temperature was noted when the first turbidity is observed.

This water infrastructure has generally focused on meeting urban water demand via a range of \u2018low-energy\u2019 approaches predominantly based on the capture and storage of surface runoff; however, this approach is proving to be no longer sufficient to satisfy the increasing urban water demand. Water service providers have been seeking to minimise supply risk through systems approaches such as demand management but more importantly through the implementation of a diverse range of energy-intensive climate-independent solutions. To date, water service providers have investigated numerous options and implemented a range of alternative water sources such as desalination, groundwater extraction, pipeline distributions and recycling schemes. These water sources, however, rely on technologies that are significantly more advanced and/or have much higher operational energy costs, and to date, many attempts to address emerging water supply problems in Australia have come at an increased economic and environmental cost.

These produced waters have the potential to contain significant concentrations of trace metals that could be of harm to the environment. Batch experiments with CO2, warm brines, and reservoir sandstones were undertaken for this thesis to determine concentrations of 8 trace metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, lead, zinc) which could be leached during CO2 storage in 4 UK North Sea hydrocarbon reservoirs. A sequential extraction procedure (SEP) was also used to determine the potential mobility of these metals under CO2 storage from mineral phases making up the reservoir samples. The results broadly showed that mobilised trace metal concentrations were low (parts per billion, ppb) in the batch experiments, with the exceptions of nickel and zinc. These metals were associated with carbonate and some feldspar dissolution, with other metals apparently desorbed from mineral surfaces, probably clays. The results of the SEP, however, were a poor predictor of actual mobility with respect to the batch experiments, although useful in determining the distribution of trace metals within the defined mineral phases (water soluble, ion exchangeable, carbonate, oxide, sulphide, silicate). In addition, fieldwork was carried out at Green River, Utah, to collect 10 CO2-driven spring water samples and 5 local aquifer rock samples. This area was used as a natural analogue for CO2-mobilised trace metals from sandstone aquifers. Trace metal concentrations in spring waters were very low (ppb) and batch experiments using Utah rock samples, spring water collected from Crystal Geyser, and CO2 confirmed very low mobility of these metals. The SEP was repeated for the Utah reservoir rocks, but again was not a reliable predictor for actual mobility, other than to confirm that overall bulk concentrations of trace metals was low. Comparison of trace metal concentrations from the batch experiments with data from UK North Sea oil and gas produced waters shows that overall, concentrations mobilised in batch experiments are within the range of concentrations across all North Sea fields reporting their data. However, on a field-by-field basis, some CO2 mobilised concentrations exceeded those currently produced by oil and gas activities. Furthermore, average batch experiment trace metal loads are higher than average oil and gas produced waters, and in some cases exceed international guidelines. Therefore, while the majority of trace metals have low mobility and therefore low environmental impact, this should be assessed on a case-by-case basis.

This is particularly because it occurred at the time of the growing awareness of global warming forcing measures towards decarbonised energy production, namely the use of fossil fuels has to be drastically reduced from the present level of more than 80% by 2050. A dilemma has now emerged because nuclear power, a CO2-free technology with proven large-scale energy production capability, lost confidence in many societies, especially in Japan and Germany. As a consequence, there is a world-wide effort now to expand renewable energies (REs), specifically photo-voltaic (PV) and wind power. However, the authors conjecture that PV and wind power can provide only up to a 40% share of the electricity production as long as sufficient storage is not available. Beyond this level, the technological (high grid power) and economic problems (large surplus production) grow. This is the result of the analysis of the growing use of REs in the electricity systems for Germany and Japan. The key element to overcome this situation is to develop suitable energy storage technologies. This is particularly necessary when electricity will become the main energy source because also transportation, process heat and heating, will be supplied by it. Facing the difficulty in replacing all fossil fuels in all countries with different technology standards, a rapid development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) might also be necessary. Therefore, for the short-range strategy up to 2050, all meaningful options have to be developed.

Rising levels of CO2, a greenhouse gas, are a major environmental problem [3]. The main source of CO2 emissions is the burning of fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal. The combustion of these fossil fuels, such as natural gas, coal, and oil, is one of the major emission sources of CO2 [4]. In addition to outdoor levels of CO2, indoor levels of CO2 have been extensively investigated because they have a direct impact on human health. Certain levels of CO2 in indoor spaces cause symptoms such as headaches, vomiting, drowsiness, and dyspnea. Certain indoor spaces, such as automobiles, subways, and aircraft, have high concentrations of CO2, which can cause serious health hazards. Thus, an increased CO2 concentration in these types of spaces is considered by many researchers to be a serious problem [5,6]. Recently, CO2 capture and storage technology, including adsorption, absorption, cryogenics, and membranes, has received increased attention motivated by environmental concerns [7-9]. Absorption into an alkanolamine solution is a conventional and mature technology; however, this method has major drawbacks, such as high regeneration energy requirements and significant waste. However, adsorption using solid sorbents has attracted widespread interest over recent years because of its low energy consumption, lower regeneration requirements, and ease of conservation and recycling [10]. A wide range of solid adsorbents are currently under investigation, including zeolites, metal organic frameworks, porous carbon materials, macro-porous silica, and certain metal oxides [11-15]. Among the solid adsorbents for CO2 capture, carbon materials, such as activated carbon (AC), carbon aerogels, graphene, and carbon nanotubes, have shown significant advantages because of their highly developed porosities and extended specific surface areas [16-24]. AC is of considerable interest because it is inexpensive, readily available, easily tuned, and thermally stable [25-27]. Surface modification can be performed via a range of treatments, such as chemical or electrochemical oxidation, chemical activation, and thermal treatment [28-30]. Chemical activation by ZnCl2, NaOH, or KOH is an effective method of controlling the poresize distributions and specific surface areas of carbon supports [31-35]. In particular, the chemical activation method using KOH has been the most widely studied. Researchers have reported that high specific surface areas and well-developed microporous structures can be obtained. Also, KOH activation is the most effective method in terms of the degree of activation. In this study, we investigated the effects of KOH activation at various ratios on the surface of AC. Samples were prepared to evaluate highly efficient CO2 capture capacities. The KOH impregnation process was initiated by mixing 1 g of AC with 4 g of KOH in a water and ethanol solution (1:1). The resulting solution was stirred to ensure even mixing and vaporized for 48 h at 90\u00b0C. Then, the products were placed in a drying oven at 80\u00b0C overnight. The activation process was performed in a tube furnace under N2 flow (200 mL/ min); it involved heating the sample at a rate of 3 \u00b0C/min up to 900\u00b0C and maintaining this DOI: http://dx.doi.org/ DOI:10.5714/CL.2016.17.1.085", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "80ffc31752cd85ff8c7f0261653b289af7b5ed6f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3187454877", "DOI": "10.1051/e3sconf/202129901009", "CorpusId": 238868327}, "title": "Experimental Study on Bubble Acoustic Characteristics of Elliptical Nozzles", "abstract": "Bubble acoustic signals were reported experimentally using five different nozzles with the same exit cross-sections.

The displacement front is unstable, which evolves from smooth into ramified patterns, when the mobility (ratio of permeability to viscosity) of the displacing fluid is larger than that of the displaced one; this phenomenon is called viscous fingering. Viscous fingering increases the residual saturation of the displaced fluid, considerably impairing the efficacy of fluid displacement. It is of practical importance to develop suitable methods to improve fluid displacement. This paper presents an experimental study on applying the discontinuity of capillary pressure to improve immiscible fluid displacement in drainage for which the displacing fluid (air) wets the porous media less preferentially than does the displaced fluid (silicone oil). The concept involves using a heterogeneous packing system, where the upstream region features large pores and small capillary pressure, and the downstream region features small pores and large capillary pressure. The increase in capillary pressure prevents fingering from directly crossing the media interface, thus enhancing the displacement. The experimental apparatus was a linear cell comprising porous media between two parallel plates, and glass beads of 0.6 and 0.125 mm diameter were packed to compose the heterogeneous porous media. The time history of the finger flow was recorded using a video camera. Pressure drops over the model from the inlet to the outlet were measured to compare viscous pressure drops with capillary pressures. The results show that the fluid displacement was increased by the capillary discontinuities. The optimal displacement was determined through linear regression by adjusting the relative length of the large- and small-pore region. The results may assist in the understanding of fingering flow across the boundaries of different grain-sized bands for the gas and oil reservoir management, such as setting the relative location of the injection and production wells. The findings may also serve as a reference for industrial applications such as placing the grain bands in an adequate series to improve the displacement efficacy in biological filtration.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "6417b72ae5eef6d97a49e3cb607e47dae2a69f7c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3001594601", "CorpusId": 204826777}, "title": "Benefits of using active reservoir management during CO2-plume development for CO2-plume geothermal (CPG) systems", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical technology in reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, operating by permanently storing captured CO2 in geologic formations. This geologically stored CO2 can be utilized in a geothermal power system, known as CO2-Plume Geothermal (CPG), which utilizes CO2 as the heat extraction fluid in an open-loop power cycle as part of a carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) process. However, the injection of CO2 into sedimentary basins can increase the reservoir pressure due to the displacement and compression of the native brine, particularly during the CO2 plume development phase for a CPG system. This can increase the risk of CO2 leakage and the formation of fractures in the reservoir and require additional pumping, and thus power consumption, to inject the CO2. Active CO2 Reservoir Management (ARM) can reduce the pressure buildup during CO2 injection by producing brine to the surface through the CPG production wells. Brine production during plume development can reduce the CO2 injection pressure and shorten the plume development period, while simultaneously producing hot brine at the surface that can be used to produce electricity (or heat) and/or fresh water by employing enhanced water recovery (EWR) methods. Here, we present how a CPG system, can be combined with ARM to manage reservoir pressures during CO2 plume development, to produce electricity using the hot brine and reduce the reservoir development time for a CPG system.

Guanidine (G) is one of such promising adsorbent molecules for CO2 capture. Recently Lee et al. (Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2015, 17, 10925-10933) reported an interaction energy (\u0394E) of -5.5 kcal mol-1 for the GCO2 complex at the CCSD(T)/CBS level, which was one of the best non-covalent interactions observed for CO2 among several functional molecules. Here we show that the non-covalent GCO2 complex can transform to a strongly interacting G-CO2 covalent complex under the influence of multiple molecules of G and CO2. The study, conducted at M06-2X/6-311++G** level density functional theory, shows \u0394E = -5.7 kcal mol-1 for GCO2 with an NC distance of 2.688 \u00c5 while almost a five-fold increase in \u0394E (-27.5 kcal mol-1) is observed for the (G-CO2)8 cluster wherein the N-C distance is 1.444 \u00c5. All the (G-CO2)n clusters (n = 2-10) show a strong N-CO2 covalent interaction with the N-C distance gradually decreasing from 1.479 \u00c5 for n = 2 to 1.444 \u00c5 for n = 8 \u2245 9, 10. The N-CO2 bonding gives (G+)-(CO2-) zwitterion character for G-CO2 and the charge-separated units preferred a cyclic arrangement in (G-CO2)n clusters due to the support of three strong intermolecular OHN hydrogen bonds from every CO2. The OHN interaction is also enhanced with an increase in the size of the cluster up to n = 8. The high \u0394E is attributed to the large cooperativity associated with the N-CO2 and OHN interactions. The quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) analysis confirms the nature and strength of such interactions, and finds that the total interaction energy is directly related to the sum of the electron density at the bond critical points of N-CO2 and OHN interactions. Further, molecular electrostatic potential analysis shows that the cyclic cluster is stabilized due to the delocalization of charges accumulated on the (G+)-(CO2-) zwitterion via multiple OHN interactions. The cyclic (G-CO2)n cluster formation is a highly exergonic process, which reveals the high CO2 adsorption capability of guanidine.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "661655602f6b6890f834945fb8b5587d0fe60dde", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1160257326", "CorpusId": 166314756}, "title": "CCS global : prospects of carbon capture and storage technologies (CCS) in emerging economies ; final report.

The results and conclusions from this work offer clear guidance on methods to model thermal radiation in oxyfuel conditions, and provide new insight on the mercury oxidation mechanism.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "cc315570c1d8f691d0bdb4bfaf1da697e0cc40e1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3132123042", "DOI": "10.1021/ACSSUSCHEMENG.0C07547", "CorpusId": 233919451}, "title": "Ambient Condition Alcohol Reforming to Hydrogen with Electricity Output", "abstract": "\u201cHydrogen economy\u201d could enable a carbon-neutral sustainable energy chain. However, issues with safety, storage, and transport of molecular hydrogen impede its realization. Alcohols as liquid H2 carriers could be enablers, but state-of-the-art reforming is difficult, requiring high temperatures >200 \u00b0C and pressures >25 bar, and the resulting H2 is carbonized beyond tolerance levels for direct use in fuel cells. Here, we demonstrate ambient temperature and pressure alcohol reforming in a fuel cell (ARFC) with a simultaneous electrical power output. The alcohol is oxidized at the alkaline anode, where the resulting CO2 is sequestrated as carbonate. Carbon-free H2 is liberated at the acidic cathode. The neutralization energy between the alkaline anode and the acidic cathode drives the process, particularly the unusually high entropy gain (1.27-fold \u0394H). The significantly positive temperature coefficient of the resulting electromotive force allows us to harvest a large fraction of the output energy from the surrounding, achieving a thermodynamic efficiency as high as 2.27. MoS2 as the cathode catalyst allows alcohol reforming even under open-air conditions, a challenge that state-of-the-art alcohol reforming failed to overcome.

The power generation sector is largely based on fossil fuels and generates a significant share of the global CO2 emissions. Thus, new power generation processes with substantially reduced CO2 emissions need to be employed to mitigate global warming. Two alternatives that may be part of the solution is the replacement of coal with biomass or to apply the concept of carbon capture and storage (CCS). In CCS processes the CO2 is captured and processed on the plant site and thereafter transported to a storage location. Oxy-fuel combustion, which has been studied in this thesis, has been demonstrated in large-scale pilot plants (30-60 MW). This work investigates the possibilities to co-combust biomass and coal in oxy-fuel combustion with CO2 capture. Biomass combined with CO2 capture has the potential to contribute to negative CO2 emissions. However, the high temperature corrosion (HTC) and the related K-Cl-S chemistry need to be studied in detail to determine the potential consequences for corrosion on heat transfer surfaces. This, since the use of biomass in power generation is problematic due to the relative high content of alkali (mainly potassium) and chlorine. Together these compounds form KCl, a salt that causes corrosive deposits and subsequent issues with so called high temperature corrosion (HTC). When sulfur is present, alkali sulfates may form instead of alkali chlorides. Sulfates have a higher melting point and causes less problems with corrosion and sulfates are therefore preferred instead of chlorides. The work in this thesis is based on experiments performed in a 100 kW combustion unit and modelling of chemical kinetics. Both the experimental and modelling results show that a high SOX concentration is preferable to achieve a high degree of sulfation of the alkali chlorides. In oxy-fuel combustion, the SOX concentration is typically high due to flue gas recycling that enables almost complete potassium sulfation in some of the studied oxycombustion atmospheres. This makes oxy-fuel combustion an attractive process for cocombustion of coal and biomass, since alkali chloride formation can be suppressed. In addition, the effect of KCl and SO2 on the CO oxidation and NO formation has been studied in both experimental and modelling work. The results show that KCl can promote COoxidation in a CO2 rich environment. However, no change was observed for the total burnout time even though the CO concentration was decreased locally. Regarding the nitrogen chemistry, KCl was found to inhibit the formation of NO whereas SO2 promotes the oxidation of already formed NO to NO2.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "2e329b9c0599336e1184c245bcac29f7f65ad35a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3120972860", "DOI": "10.17161/mg.v1i.15529", "CorpusId": 244320873}, "title": "Geological characterization of the Patterson CO2 storage site from 3-D seismic data", "abstract": "\nApproximately 26 square miles of new 3-D seismic data were acquired in July 2019 over the Patterson Site (Kearny County, Kansas) to assess its potential for carbon dioxide (CO2) storage. Seismic interpretation revealed that the Patterson Site contains multiple structural closures that lie on uplifted fault blocks, bounded by two reverse faults that strike nearly perpendicular to each other. These faults offset Precambrian through Pennsylvanian sections, including several primary reservoir and seal intervals. Fault displacements are maximum at the Precambrian basement and decrease upward. Data indicated a range of structural and combination traps exists at the Patterson Site in the Cambrian-Ordovician Arbuckle through Mississippian Osagian reservoirs. The three-way closures along the NW\u2013SE fault have structural relief of ~130 ft (40 m), and the four-way closures contain relief of ~60 ft (18 m). Erosional surfaces and multiple basement fractures also are observed on the top of the Precambrian. A Mississippian-aged incised valley system also was observed at the Patterson Site. The incised valleys formed during the Meramecian-Chesteran Stages with an incised depth up to 250 ft (76 m). The motion of the reverse faults likely captured existing meandering and linear channels, causing the current deeply incised morphology. The incised valleys observed at Patterson are similar in age, structural style, shape, incision depth, and seismic attribute properties to incised valleys observed by other workers at Pleasant Prairie South, Eubank, and Shuck oil fields (southwest Kansas). Further research should focus on estimating reactivation tendency and sealing characteristics of the reverse faults to evaluate the seal integrity of the saline reservoirs. This will reduce uncertainty concerning the risk of CO2 migration during injection and storage. Further reservoir description, modeling, and simulation are also underway to characterize the storage potential at the Patterson Site. \n", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "c6fdd3f39fa5a25542dec5bb768eb96aeed779b3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3042645250", "DOI": "10.1109/EnT48576.2020.00013", "CorpusId": 220607411}, "title": "Development of key technologies in the electric power industry to achieve the requirements of maintaining the limit of atmospheric temperature increase by 1.5 \u00b0C by 2050", "abstract": "Since 2017, the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has been steadily growing, despite the constant increase in the share of renewable energy sources (RES) in the total amount of electricity consumed. The reason for this growth is not in the low RES efficiency, but in the fact that about 40% of all electricity is generated at coal-fired power plants. Many existing forecasts and analytical reports on 100% transition to renewable energy by 2050 in reality are not fulfilled. To completely eliminate CO2 emissions by 2050, the requirement arising from current forecasts, the rate of implementation of renewable energy potential is not enough. For this reason, there is a risk that the strategy with 100% RES by 2050, which is widely discussed, will not achieve its goals.

These two studies demonstrated early on the usefulness and versatility of MOFs. Beyond these robust porous frameworks, Kitagawa also developed the concept of the framework, possessing both porosity and structural flexibility. He predicted the existence and importance of this class of materials, and gave it the generic name of soft porous crystals. An important class of soft porous crystals is the flexible MOFs, which are regarded as cooperatively integrating \u201csoftness\u201d and \u201ccrystallinity\u201d. The precise combination of metal ions and organic ligands created a variety of flexible MOFs, and he demonstrated the supercritical gas recognition for separation (2003). A flexible framework can adsorb the target gas at a certain pressure via structural changes, and then release the adsorbed gas by the pressure-swing method. He optimized the flexibility in the structures, and achieved high CO2-separation ability over CH4 in low-regeneration-energy materials (2012). It has been shown that some of his flexible MOFs offer lowenergy CO2 separation from biogas. He created MOF materials whose gas-adsorption properties are controllable by applying external stimuli such as light or electric fields. Switchable pore surfaces were synthesized that can be activated by the photoirradiation procedure (2010). On-demand trapping of a molecular decoding system used a structural entanglement to detect a single target molecule of benzene derivatives in a vapor form with a corresponding luminescent readout (2011). By the use of a redox-active MOF, the high selectivity for O2 and NO over various gases was demonstrated. MOFs contain an electrondonating organic linker and oxidation of the ligand occurs as specific gases are adsorbed (2010). Beyond this functionalization of the host framework, he also made a responsive MOF by using guest accommodation. He incorporated fluorescence signaling molecules in the porous structure, with the fluorescence of the hybrid material being switched ON/OFF via adsorption of CO2 gas (2011), allowing low-concentration gas sensing. He demonstrated reversible switching of magnetic states in MOFs by guest adsorption (2009). An Fe2+-based MOF with cyano-ligand bridging exhibits bistability between the high spin (HS) state and the low spin (LS) state at room temperature. The MOF can adopt both the HS and LS states depending on the adsorbed gases. These magnetic states are switched by gas adsorption/desorption at room temperature. The incorporation of such responsive groups in MOFs demonstrates their large potential to create advanced porous materials. Kitagawa noticed that the thermal transitions of confined organic polymers, important in molecule-/ion-transport technology, can be controlled within nanospaces. He showed that the pore size and surface functionality of MOFs can be tailored to study the transition behavior of confined polymers, providing Metal\u2013organic framewrks (MOFs), also known as porous coordination polymers (PCPs), are an emerging class of porous materials. Due to their structural and functional tunability, the field of MOFs has become one of the fastest growing fields in not only chemistry but also material science. With the maturation of the synthesis methodology, structure characterization, and functionality modification, a new era of MOFs as a useful material has begun, with a huge number publications appearing in the last few years, dealing with their applications in a variety of directions, even devices. Here, we are greatly honored to assemble a compendium of the latest work on MOFs toward their applications from the materials angle, in this special issue in honor of Professor Susumu Kitagawa at Kyoto University, one of the pioneers of the MOF field. As early as in 1997, Kitagawa successfully demonstrated porosity in solid coordination networks with gas-sorption experiments. He synthesized a wide variety of MOFs and developed a comprehensive structural chemistry. In the early stage of MOF chemistry, he focused on sufficiently small and uniform pores, which possess comparable size to the oxygen molecule, and realized that gaseous oxygen can be made to form regular one-dimensional chains. This gave unprecedented insight into the properties of confined gases, with the resulting highly compressed packing of O2 comparable to that in solid oxygen at 2 GPa (2002). Acetylene is a gas with many industrial applications; however, it is hard to handle because of its explosive nature. A highly efficient method to separate it from its close relation, carbon dioxide (CO2), is a promising route for purifying and storing \u201cstrategic\u201d gases in general. He succeeded in the highly selective capture and storage of acetylene (C2H2) gas against CO2 under ambient conditions (2005).

These important problems have drawn on all of the tools familiar to transportation scientists, but have introduced fresh challenges to motivate new research. We open the special issue with \u201cOptimal Control of Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles with Market Impact and Risk Attitude\u201d by Lai Wei and Yongpei Guan. This paper addresses the problem of using batteries in electric vehicles as a form of storage which can be bid into both real-time and day-ahead markets by vehicleto-grid aggregators. Wei and Guan develop models and algorithms to solve the day-ahead and real-time bidding problems, considering both risk-neutral and risk-averse settings. They study the effect of storage on electricity prices, and show the benefits of allowing the aggregator to participate in both the day-ahead and real-time markets. Next, the paper \u201cForecasting the Demand for Electric Vehicles: Accounting for Attitudes and Perceptions\u201d by Aurelie Glerum, Lidija Stankovikj, Michael Themans, and Michel Bierlaire address the problem of forecasting the demand for vehicle technologies that are only seeing very early adoption, limiting access to historical information. They address the problems of survey design, model estimation, and forecasting, developing in the process a method that corrects for selection biases due to the setting of a new technology. They develop a revealed preference model from stated preference data which required taking into account population structure to forecast demand for new products as they are entered. Not surprisingly, operational challenges remain.

The four principal sections of the paper focus on: upstream oil and gas technology; electric power technologies, with sub-divisions on clean fossil fuels, carbon dioxide sequestration, renewables and nuclear power; the transportation sector; and fuel cell technology, together with hydrogen, as a secondary energy-carrier. The paper concludes that, through 2020 and beyond, oil will continue to be the major source fuelling the forecast rise in energy demand, especially in the transportation sector. Gas will play an increasing role in electricity generation, which will continue growing at a faster rate than overall energy demand. The successful deployment of cleaner, more efficient technologies is expected to help coal retain its importance. However, widespread concern about climate change issues may threaten to constrain the growth in demand for fossil fuels, and this concern must be addressed through such measures as CO2 capture and storage sequestration technology. Nuclear power is unlikely to assume a larger role in the global energy mix, unless such fundamental obstacles as economic competitiveness and public acceptance are overcome. Most renewables face challenging environmental and sustainability constraints and require substantial cost reductions to be competitive. Moreover, while fuel cells have many attractive features, including high efficiency and reduced or near-zero emissions, they have many complex material and manufacturing problems and their commercial prospects are limited for the foreseeable future. Therefore, unless unexpected compelling reasons to do otherwise arise, cleaner fossil fuels will continue to dominate the power sector, as well as most other sectors, for decades to come.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "dc275a77b9c4609ccf3eaf32c4684dcbef7b68d4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "201964389", "CorpusId": 67848622}, "title": "A reconsideration of the use of domestic CHP in the UK domestic market", "abstract": "UK climate change policy relies on a combination of nuclear power, renewable generation (mostly wind power) and carbon capture and storage to decarbonize the electricity grid. There are technical, economic or public acceptability issues with all elements of this strategy. Advancements in gas extraction technology mean that natural gas should be available for most of this century; consequently it is worth re-examining the use of gas fired micro combined heat and power units (CHP) as a way of meeting medium term emission reduction goals. The Carbon Trust carried out field trials of micro CHP units in domestic and small scale commercial applications in England. Units based on Stirling Engines were used in domestic applications and found to produce only modest emission savings when compared to condensing boilers and grid electricity. Internal combustion (IC) engines were used in the commercial premises and these produced nearly twice the emission savings of the Stirling engines. The IC units were used with auxiliary boilers for peak and low load duties following established commercial CHP practice. Currently small Stirling engine micro CHP plants receive feed in tariff payments in the UK but there is no support for small (IC) engine CHP schemes. Unfortunately the field trials did not investigate heating groups of a few houses in the same way as a commercial property. This study models this option and expands it to integrate solar water heating into the system to reduce the need to run the system purely for hot water in the summer. It was found that by using thermal stores it is possible to satisfy traditional heating patterns while only running the CHP plant at times of peak electricity demand. As such they could form a key component in the national electricity mix as well as supplying low carbon heat.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "e4657cc5611a41354f79c92383bc66c0270b73bb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2289333347", "DOI": "10.2172/1082145", "CorpusId": 111801880}, "title": "Design Concepts for Co-Production of Power, Fuels & Chemicals Via Coal/Biomass Mixtures", "abstract": "The overall goal of the program is to develop design concepts, incorporating advanced technologies in areas such as oxygen production, feed systems, gas cleanup, component separations and gas turbines, for integrated and economically viable coal and biomass fed gasification facilities equipped with carbon capture and storage for the following scenarios: (i) coproduction of power along with hydrogen, (ii) coproduction of power along with fuels, (iii) coproduction of power along with petrochemicals, and (iv) coproduction of power along with agricultural chemicals. To achieve this goal, specifically the following objectives are met in this proposed project: (i) identify advanced technology options and innovative preliminary design concepts that synergistically integrate plant subsections, (ii) develop steady state system simulations to predict plant efficiency and environmental signature, (iii) develop plant cost estimates by capacity factoring major subsystems or by major equipment items where required, and then capital, operating and maintenance cost estimates, and (iv) perform techno- economic analyses for the above described coproduction facilities. Thermal efficiencies for the electricity only cases with 90% carbon capture are 38.26% and 36.76% (HHV basis) with the bituminous and the lignite feedstocks respectively. For the coproduction cases (where 50% of the energy exported is in the form of electricity),more\u00a0\u00bb the electrical efficiency, as expected, is highest for the hydrogen coproduction cases while lowest for the higher alcohols (ethanol) coproduction cases. The electrical efficiencies for Fischer-Tropsch coproduction cases are slightly higher than those for the methanol coproduction cases but it should be noted that the methanol (as well as the higher alcohol) coproduction cases produce the finished coproduct while the Fischer-Tropsch coproduction cases produce a coproduct that requires further processing in a refinery. The cross comparison of the thermal performance between the various coproduct cases is further complicated by the fact that the carbon footprint is not the same when carbon leaving with the coproduct are accounted for. The economic analysis and demand for a particular coproduct in the market place is a more meaningful comparison of the various coproduction scenarios. The first year cost of electricity calculated for the bituminous coal is $102.9/MWh while that for the lignite is $108.1/MWh. The calculated cost of hydrogen ranged from $1.42/kg to $2.77/kg depending on the feedstock, which is lower than the DOE announced hydrogen cost goal of $3.00/kg in July 14, 2005. Methanol cost ranged from $345/MT to $617/MT, while the market price is around $450/MT. For Fischer-Tropsch liquids, the calculated cost ranged from $65/bbl to $112/bbl, which is comparable to the current market price of crude oil at around $100/bbl. It should be noted, however, that F-T liquids contain no sulfur and nitrogen compounds. The calculated cost of alcohol ranged from $4.37/gal to $5.43/gal, while it ranged from $2.20/gal to $3.70/gal in a DOE funded study conducted by Louisiana State University. The Louisiana State University study consisted of a significantly larger plant than our study and benefited from economies of scale. When the plant size in our study is scaled up to similar size as in the Louisiana State University study, cost of alcohol is then reduced to a range of $3.24/gal to $4.28/gal, which is comparable.

Due to the complexity of the mineral sequestration of CO2 in water-waste suspensions, an important issue is to determine the reaction mechanisms.

Since then, the CSCST community has continuously grown and further contributed to the various fields of Chemical Science, Engineering and Technology in the UK, as well as worldwide. CSCST has the long tradition of organising the CSCSTannual conference, which dates back to the first year of the establishment of the Society. The annual conference serves as a vibrant multidisciplinary platform for members to expand their personal and professional networks, to showcase their recent research innovations, to enable the exchange experiences and ideas, to develop links between fundamentals and industrial practice and applications, to develop their careers, and to flourish the Society. The 25 edition (CSCST-25, 06\u201307 September 2018) of the CSCST annual conference was hosted by The University of Manchester with the theme of Chemical Engineering, Materials Sciences, Energy and Surface Chemistry. CSCST-25 was attended by 100 + delegates with 30 + oral and/or poster presentations, which featured several plenary and keynote lectures by national and international eminent speakers (such as Prof. Martin Schr\u00f6der, Vice-President and Dean of the Faculty of Science and Engineering, The University of Manchester). Built on the success of CSCST-25, in collaboration with the Frontiers of Chemical Science and Engineering, we organised the Special Issue on CSCST-25 and invited the colleagues to submit manuscripts related to their conference presentations and research topics.

However, the calculations of process rates such as dissolution of CO2 into formation water remain uncertain due to indirectly determined ages of the CO2 influx. The proposed ages for the Bravo Dome gas field in New Mexico, USA, vary from 56 ka to 1.5 Ma. Here we demonstrate that residence times can be estimated from simple modeling of noble gas and stable isotope diffusion profiles from the gas-water contact through the gas column. The Bravo Dome gas field shows a gradient in noble gas concentrations and isotopic ratios from east to west across the 70-km-wide field. A mantle-like end member with a 3He/4He (R/RA) ratio of up to 4.7 is found in the west in contrast to a groundwater end member with high concentrations of air- and crustal-derived noble gases in the east. The air- and crustal-derived noble gases decrease gradually toward the west. Stable isotope compositions (C and O) also vary across the field.

In typical injection wells, Ordinary Portland cement (OPC) based cement is used as well cement and it has been found that it undergoes degradation in CO2 rich environment. Geopolymer can be a good alternative to existing OPC based well cement as it has been found that geopolymer possess high strength and durability compared to OPC.

Our estimates include the cost of marginal damages caused by coal plant emissions. On average, we estimate that the levelized cost of coal, including externalities, is $84/MWh. It is efficient to abate emissions of air pollutants (SO x , NO x and PM 2.5) but not of CO 2. Then the cost wrought by environmental externalities equals $23/MWh or 27% of total cost. Depending on the price of coal, the levelized cost of coal may vary between $72 and $99/MWh. The levelized cost of wind is $144/MWh with capacity factor of 24%. This cost includes the cost backup capacity to maintain LOLP, which equals $13/MWh or 9% of total cost. The levelized cost of wind varies between $107/MWh with capacity factors of 35% to $217/MWh with capacity factors of 15%. We conclude that wind is competitive only when it achieves capacity factors around 35% and coal prices are very high. So far the average annual capacity factor achieved by existing wind farms in Chile has been less than 20%, which suggests why wind has developed only slowly. I.

Beyond the land (forests), there is little appreciation of just how important ocean nature is to climate mitigation.

We measured how much blue carbon occurs around the remote islands and seamounts of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago Marine Protected Zone (MPZ). We estimated that there are 300 tonnes of carbon (tC) captured in seaweed biomass each year, a proportion of which will sink and become a part of the long-term sediment carbon store. In deeper water we found a standing stock of ~2.3 million tC in the shallowest 1000 m depths, of which equivalent to 0.8 million t of carbon dioxide has the potential to be sequestered.

This standing stock is protected and growth could, therefore, generate an additional \u00a33.5 million worth of sequestered carbon a year, making it an unrecognized major component of the local economy. The economic return on this example MPZ probably ranks highly amongst climate mitigation schemes. The message is that placing meaningful protection to carbon-rich natural habitats can massively help society fight climate change and biodiversity loss. Nations who provide this protection should be fairly compensated, particularly where it comes at the detriment of other economic uses of marine habitats. Abstract Carbon-rich habitats can provide powerful climate mitigation if meaningful protection is put in place. We attempted to quantify this around the Tristan da Cunha archipelago Marine Protected Area. Its shallows (<1000 m depth) are varied and productive. The 5.4 km2 of kelp stores ~60 tonnes of carbon (tC) and may export ~240 tC into surrounding depths. In deep-waters we analysed seabed data collected from three research cruises, including seabed mapping, camera imagery, seabed oceanography and benthic samples from mini-Agassiz trawl. Rich biological assemblages on seamounts significantly differed to the islands and carbon storage had complex drivers. We estimate ~2.3 million tC are stored in benthic biodiversity of waters <1000 m, which includes >0.22 million tC that can be sequestered (the proportion of the carbon captured that is expected to become buried in sediment or locked away in skeletal tissue for at least 100 years). Much of this carbon is captured by cold-water coral reefs as a mixture of inorganic (largely calcium carbonate) and organic compounds. As part of its 2020 Marine Protection Strategy, these deep-water reef systems are now protected by a full bottom-trawling ban throughout Tristan da Cunha and representative no take areas on its seamounts. This small United Kingdom Overseas Territory\u2019s reef systems represent approximately 0.8 Mt CO2 equivalent sequestered carbon; valued at >\u00a324 Million GBP (at the UN shadow price of carbon). Annual productivity of this protected standing stock generates an estimated \u00a33 million worth of sequestered carbon a year, making it an unrecognized and potentially major component of the economy of small island nations like Tristan da Cunha. Conservation of near intact habitats are expected to provide strong climate and biodiversity returns, which are exemplified by this MPA.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "ef23ce899e7eb1f5430298f00d6e95c2cafcf0ed", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2766144591", "DOI": "10.2138/AM-2018-6138CCBY", "CorpusId": 56260030}, "title": "A siltstone reaction front related to CO2- and sulfur-bearing fluids: Integrating quantitative elemental mapping with reactive transport modeling", "abstract": "Abstract For the purpose of geological carbon storage, it is necessary to understand the long-term effects of introducing CO2 and sulfur-species into saline aquifers. CO2 stripped from the flue gas during the carbon capture process may contain trace SO2 and H2S and it may be economically beneficial to inject S-bearing CO2 rather than costly purified CO2. Furthermore, reactions between the S-CO2-bearing formation brines and formation minerals will increase pH and promote further dissolution and precipitation reactions. To investigate this we model reactions in a natural analog where CO2- and SO4-H2S bearing fluids have reacted with clay-rich siltstones. In the Mid-Jurassic Carmel formation in a cap rock to a natural CO2-bearing reservoir at Green River, Utah, a 3.1 mm wide bleached alteration zone is observed at the uppermost contact between a primary gypsum bed and red siltstone. Gypsum at the contact is ~1 mm thick and shows elongate fibers perpendicular to the siltstone surface, suggesting fluid flow along the contact. Mineralogical concentrations, analyzed by Quantitative Evaluation of Minerals by SCANning electron microscopy (QEMSCAN), show the altered siltstone region comprises two main zones: a 0.8 mm wide, hematite-poor, dolomite-poor, and illite-rich region adjacent to the gypsum bed; and a 2.3 mm wide, hematite-poor, dolomite-poor, and illite-poor region adjacent to the hematite alteration front. A one-component analytical solution to reactive-diffusive transport for the bleached zone implies it took less than 20 yr to form before the fluid self-sealed, and that literature hematite dissolution rates between 10\u20138 and 10\u20137 mol/m2/s are valid for likely diffusivities. Multi-component reactive-diffusive transport equilibrium modeling for the full phase assemblage, conducted with PHREEQC, suggests dissolution of hematite and dolomite and precipitation of illite over similar short timescales. Reaction progress with CO2-bearing, SO4-rich, and minor H2S-bearing fluids is shown to be much faster than with CO2-poor, SO4-rich with minor H2S-bearing fluids. The substantial buffering capacity of mineral reactions demonstrated by the S- and CO2-related alteration of hematite-bearing siltstones at the Green River CO2 accumulation implies that corrosion of such a cap rock are, at worst, comparable to the 10 000 yr timescales needed for carbon storage.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "b5158783d9c88b1849cf1efd850d677b8cb8665e", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1016/j.enconman.2022.115346", "CorpusId": 246937750}, "title": "Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) potential in jet fuel production from forestry residues: A combined Techno-Economic and Life Cycle Assessment approach", "abstract": null, "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "a44d68d7dc2ff32979477a0f65c4a35a1af8df0d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2362258318", "CorpusId": 101490323}, "title": "To Deal with Climate Change\u2014Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide capture and storage(CCS) technology is seen as one of the most promising solutions to global climate change.The CCS technology mainly includes three aspects: CO2 capture,transport and storage.Firstly,this paper introduces the CO2 capture technology,which can be categorized into pre-combustion capture,enriched oxygen combustion capture,post-combustion capture and chemical looping combustion capture;then the paper introduces the CO2 storage technology,which can be categorized into geology storage and ocean storage according to storage site.Among many CO2 storage technologies,CO2 enhanced oil recovery(CO2-EOR) technology has been widely used in recent years with its high economic benefits;finally the paper describes the domestic and international development of the CO2-EOR technology in detail.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "50ce7319927f19ecea4e61faa82681d5651c16e6", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/syscon/KrahELOCNE20", "MAG": "3110651275", "DOI": "10.1109/SysCon47679.2020.9275853", "CorpusId": 228094307}, "title": "Opportunities for Clean Energy in Natural Gas Well Operations", "abstract": "The oil and gas industry is increasingly seeking operational improvements to reduce both costs and emissions while improving resilience against electric grid outages.

Two different types of experimental set-up are used. They both allow local measurement of the water saturation for low and high pressure/temperature condition. A small MRI core-flood set-up is used to perform experiments at 35\u00b0C and 10 bars pore pressure, in CO2 non-dense condition. In order to work under reservoir condition, at 40\u00b0C and 130 bars, with dense supercritical CO2 we used a classical core-flood system coupled to an X-ray detection set-up. All experiments were carried out in similar Clashach sandstones with permeability between 220 and 1500 mD, and porosity in the range 10-20%. The gas and the surfactantbrine solution were co-injected at the core inlet face with a gas fraction around 0.7. We vary the interstitial velocity within two decades from about 3 ft/day up to 100 ft/day. The performance of the generated foams was evaluated from the relative foam viscosity, the ratio of the measured pressure drop in the presence of foam to the pressure drop in single phase condition for the same interstitial velocity. Whatever the pressure and permeability/porosity, the relative foam viscosity can be described as a power law vs. the shear rate evaluated from the interstitial velocity, permeability and porosity. The exponent is close to -1 describing the shear-thinning behavior. INTRODUCTION The oil and gas industry has a long-term experience in reducing the flow rate of a given fluid, or maximizing the oil and gas recovery, by injecting fluids with specific properties into rock formations containing hydrocarbons. As it has already been stated, Carbon Capture and Sequestration programs (CCS) could benefit from the CO2-Enhanced-OilRecovery knowledge. Indeed, in the EOR context, the gas-based injections are now the most common methods since the decline of the thermal ones in the early 2000\u2019s. Due to its unique properties such as low minimum miscibility pressure, CO2 has been mainly used in such techniques.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "5a1abea7d4f2cfb5131a711a9dc0a209740d3aef", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2896289190", "CorpusId": 125953592}, "title": "Bulk viscosity effects in compressible turbulent Couette flow", "abstract": "This work investigates the effect of bulk viscosity in one-, two-, and three\u2013dimensional compressible flows via direct numerical simulation. The role of bulk viscosity in compressible turbulence is of increasing importance due to three applications: spacecraft descending through the Martian atmosphere, the thermodynamic cycle of solar\u2013thermal power plant, and carbon capture and storage compressors. All three rely on the accurate description of turbulence in carbon dioxide, a gas with a bulk\u2013to\u2013shear viscosity ratio three orders of magnitude larger than for air. In these applications, invoking Stokes\u2019s hypothesis is questioned as the divergence of velocity is non\u2013zero, implying a significant difference between mechanical and thermodynamic pressures. Results of a constantly forced velocity perturbation follow the same trend as that predicted by Landau\u2019s acoustic absorption coefficient for sufficiently high Reynolds numbers. Below an optimum Reynolds number, the damping effectiveness reduces by a different mechanism to that of Landau. Maximum damping is achieved at an acoustic Reynolds number equal to unity. Two\u2013 dimensional decaying turbulence at the bulk-to-shear viscosity ratio of carbon dioxide demonstrates that the magnitude of the dilatational production term is greatly enhanced and is strongly biased to negative values, reducing the generation of velocity dilatation compared to the zero bulk viscosity case. Compressible Couette flow at two Reynolds numbers and two bulk\u2013to\u2013shear viscosity ratios show minimal changes to mean flow quantities and the main terms of interest in the turbulence kinetic energy budget. Instantaneous views of the dilatational velocity field show that an intermediate range of scales are damped in accordance with Landau\u2019s acoustic damping coefficient. At small scales, however, damping reduces and turbulent patterns are preserved.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "ba40ee586ba124373c2bf718175b995d90dfbeca", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2398281840", "CorpusId": 2299336}, "title": "Integrated Simulation and Optimization for Carbon Capture and Storage System", "abstract": "CO2 capture and storage/sequestration (CCS) is a key technology for addressing the global warming issue.
