While an extreme perspective is to envision CCS as a magic bullet to solve the issue of climate change, a more balanced economics perspective would situate this approach within a portfolio of mitigation actions. CCS can be implemented with two purposes: it can act as a substitute for other technological efforts to reach a given environmental target and it offers the potential for additional emission reductions to reach a \u2018safer\u2019 climate target. In order to balance these two possible ways of utilizing CCS and to assess their respective effects on early policy strategies, we have undertaken a twofold numerical experiment. First, a cost-efficiency analysis was undertaken, where the sole effect of CCS was substitution for other efforts. This was followed by a cost\u2014benefit analysis where both purposes had to be balanced. We find that future availability of CCS is less of a reason to relax near-term abatement efforts than what could be inferred from previous analyses.

Scenario analyses were conducted applying a geochemical batch equilibrium model for a virtual CO2 injection into a saline Keuper aquifer.

This article surveys and evaluates the technology of processing carbon dioxide and hydrogen into sustainable synthetic carbohydrate fuels and the related economics in relation to a particular route, the capture of carbon dioxide from the flue gas stream of gas burning power stations, provided the gaseous fuel is of biogenic origin. Biogenic methane is renewable and can, after combustion into carbon dioxide, via carbon capture be further processed into a range of carbohydrate fuels, or alternatively captured for final storage under carbon capture and store (CCS). It is proposed that the air intake of a power station be replaced by cooled flue gases consisting mainly of carbon dioxide, enriched with oxygen obtained by electrolysis of water. The co-produced hydrogen can then be processed further into more easily transportable and storable forms of fuel. This implies that a gas-fired power station is not so much a means of producing energy, but rather of producing pure carbon dioxide. The capture process as such is the same as the one which arises if the purpose is carbon capture and use or CCS in which case capture of CO2 from the combustion of methane from biogenic origin amounts to negative emissions. The indirect route of supplying and using energy via the production of carbohydrate fuels requires much more primary energy than the direct use of electricity does. For this reason, use of that indirect route is efficient for aviation, where the direct route of electric power is impractical. For shipping, there also is the alternative of the implicit transport of hydrogen as part of ammonia. It is assumed that the use of biogenic methane followed by processing of the captured carbon dioxide into synthetic hydrocarbon fuels is in combination with volcanic carbon hydroxide, sufficient to meet the demand for hydrocarbon fuels.

The most mature technology for post-combustion capture uses a liquid sorbent, amine scrubbing. However, with the existing technology, a large amount of heat is required for the regeneration of the liquid sorbent, which introduces a substantial energy penalty. The use of alternative sorbents for CO2 capture, such as the CaO-CaCO3 system, has been investigated extensively in recent years. However there are significant problems associated with the use of CaO based sorbents, the most challenging one being the deactivation of the sorbent material. When sorbents such as natural limestone are used, the capture capacity of the solid sorbent can fall by as much as 90 mol% after the first 20 carbonation-regeneration cycles. In this study a variety of techniques were employed to understand better the cause of this deterioration from both a structural and morphological standpoint. X-ray and neutron PDF studies were employed to understand better the local surface and interfacial structures formed upon reaction, finding that after carbonation the surface roughness is decreased for CaO. In situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies showed that carbonation with added steam leads to a faster and more complete conversion of CaO than under conditions without steam, as evidenced by the phases seen at different depths within the sample. Finally, in situ X-ray tomography experiments were employed to track the morphological changes in the sorbents during carbonation, observing directly the reduction in porosity and increase in tortuosity of the pore network over multiple calcination reactions.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "31d132a5381d3e1e5ea018dd506f474eeecec056", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1492927689", "CorpusId": 106818437}, "title": "Podziemne magazynowanie dwutlenku w\u0119gla", "abstract": "W artykule omowiono istotne problemy zwi\u0105zane z podziemnym magazynowaniem dwutlenku wegla.

The idea of underground storage is presented as one of methods of reducing the emissions of this greenhouse gas. A special attention is paid to the issues of capturing, transportation and costs of CO2 storage. Problems with defining underground storage potential, physical and chemical effects of CO2 injection into underground reservoirs and storage in underground aquifers, hydrocarbons deposits and coal seams are discussed.

On-site hydrogen production using ammonia decomposition offers a sustainable and cost-efficient solution for hydrogen refuelling stations, and separating H2 from a H2\u2013N2 mixture is a necessary step to obtain high-purity H2 (>99.97%). In the scale of a hydrogen refuelling station (\u223c300 Nm3 h\u22121), using pressure-swing adsorption (PSA) is not feasible owing to its low recovery, while using polymeric membranes cannot meet the H2 purity demand. To achieve both a high H2 purity and high H2 recovery, we developed a physical-chemical system model of a 300 Nm3 h\u22121on-site NH3-fed hydrogen refuelling station to optimize a H2 purification subsystem, and furthermore predicted the system efficiency and economic feasibility.

The proposed stochastic model accounts for the spatial distribution of reservoir properties and is implemented in a case study of the Oriskany Formation of the Appalachian sedimentary basin. Results indicate that the CO2 storage resource for the Pennsylvania part of the Oriskany Formation has substantial spatial variation due to heterogeneity of formation properties and basin geology leading to significant uncertainty in the storage assessment. The Oriskany Formation sequestration resource estimate in Pennsylvania calculated with the effective efficiency factor, E=5%, ranges from 0.15 to 1.01 gigatonnes (Gt) with a mean value of 0.52 Gt of CO2 (E=5%). The methodology is generalizable to other sedimentary formations in which site-specific trend analyses and statistical models are developed to estimate the CO2 sequestration storage capacity and its uncertainty.

Oldenburg, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA, USA While research is still needed to answer scientific and technical questions about CO 2 Capture and Storage (CCS), it is largely economic and political forces rather than technical issues that have prevented widespread deployment of CCS over the last decade. Meanwhile, the energy-climate crisis continues as fossil-fuel use grows, causing atmospheric concentrations of CO 2 to increase, along with global atmospheric temperatures and the associated measurable and costly impacts on Earth\u2019s climate. Given the current economic and political state of affairs, it is natural to look for ways other than storage (seques- tration) by which mankind can decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. With CO 2 accounting for approximately 70% of the GHG radiative forcing from among the other main GHGs (CH 4 , N 2 O, CF 4 , C 2 F 6 , SF 6 , and HFC-23, 134a, and 152a), and with abundant fossil-fuel-combustion point sources of CO 2 available, it makes sense to focus on reducing net emissions of CO 2 by any and all means. With direct injection into the ground for permanent sequestration currently considered expensive and lacking popular support, many people concerned about energy and climate have turned to studying utilization of CO 2 \u2013 so-called CO 2 Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS). In fact, the annual CCS confer- ence held for several years now in Pittsburgh changed its name this year to the 11th Annual Conference on Carbon Capture Utilization & Sequestration. Currently, CO 2 is used beneficially for a large number of purposes in the chemical, pharmaceutical, food and beverage, agricultural, healthcare, environ- mental, energy resource extraction, pulp and paper, electronic, metals, and fire safety industries . 1,2 In the area of energy resource extraction, the oil industry injects millions of tonnes of CO 2 per year for enhanced oil recovery (CO 2 - EOR). While much of the current utilization demand makes use of CO 2 as is, vast amounts of CO 2 are also converted into a variety of useful products such as urea (fertilizer), formic acid (preservative for animal feed), and syngas (fuel). Although there exist many potential large-scale uses for CO 2 , the current demand is dwarfed by the potential supply from anthropogenic sources (mostly fossil fuel combustion), and projections of increased fossil-fuel use make it difficult to envision utilization ever solving the energy-climate crisis. For example, Song 3 estimated the total potential US demand for CO 2 in the chemical and materials industries at approximately 6 MtCO 2 /yr, approximately the output of a 750 MW coal- fired power plant. CO 2 -EOR within the USA currently uses a lot more CO 2 than do the chemical and material industries, approximately 48 Mt CO 2 /yr, 3 or the output of six 1-GW coal-fired power plants. Urea production in the USA is the largest single use at 120 Mt CO 2 /yr. 2 Meanwhile, the current US power plant CO 2 emissions are estimated to be about 3 Gt CO 2 /yr, or about 15 times larger than the current US utilization rate of approximately 200 Mt CO 2 /yr. Moreover, it deserves mention here that the vast majority of CO 2 used for EOR comes from natural CO 2 reservoirs rather than anthropogenic sources. While we can envision policies arising from concern for climate that will motivate greater utilization of anthropogenic CO 2 , this greater utilization rate will occur in a future with potentially much larger rates of CO 2 emissions, assuming that global projections of increased de- mand for energy and its modes of generation are correct. Despite the raw numbers and what they reveal about the imbalance between today\u2019s CO 2 utilization and anthropo- genic emissions, increasing CO 2 utilization is still a worthy goal. The fact is we need to start reducing CO 2 emis- sions in every way we can. The problem of global anthropogenic GHG emissions of approximately 30 Gt CO 2 /yr is so large that it demands solutions from every corner of Earth. For example, off-setting electricity production from coal by greater use of nuclear and renewable energy sources is an effective CO 2 emissions mitigation strategy, but utilization can potentially reduce CO 2 emissions even more than these fuel-substitution approaches. 4 And there is hope for large increases in utilization. First, increased application of CO 2 -EOR, along with a large-scale switchover to anthropogenic", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "7be92e6de0ae86cd5ddf51046a68a0b9f1acce62", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2090198342", "DOI": "10.2118/123582-MS", "CorpusId": 140599347}, "title": "Modeling CO2 Storage in Aquifers : Assessing the key contributors to uncertainty", "abstract": "We study the influence of different physical properties o n the effectiveness of CO 2 storage in aquifers. We present the results of a numerical sensitivity analysis using experimental design to quantify and compare the contribution of the most impo rtant parameters to the trapping of CO 2. The work focuses on the impact of dissolution and residual tr apping. Simulations using a reservoir model with properties and geometries representative of the Stuggart Formation in K etzin (Germany) demonstrate how different trapping mechan isms are influenced by gravity segregation, fingering, and c hanneling. These studies show that horizontal permeability is the mos t influential parameter on the total amount of CO 2 dissolved, as it facilitates the lateral migration of CO 2, enhancing dissolution into the brine. Residual gas saturati on Sgr is found to be the greatest contributor to the amount of residual CO 2. As expected, higher S gr will reduce CO2 mobility, producing a higher residual trail left by the CO 2 plume as it migrates. In addition, permeability heterogeneity is a major contributor to both trapping mechanisms. After a suitable geological site for CO 2 storage has been selected, our studies suggest that wit appropriate well placement and injection strategy, at least 80% of the stored CO 2 can be trapped within a few decades of the end of injection . Introduction The global average temperature has increased over the last century by 0.6\u00b0C, snow precipitation and the ice extent have reduced considerably and the sea level and ocean temperature h ve risen ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , 2001). This problem is almost certainly exacerbated by the emis sion of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, and principally CO 2, into the atmosphere. More than 13 Gig tons (1Gt = 10 9 kg) of carbon dioxide is emitted from stationary sources eve ry y ar, of which more than 70% comes from burning fossil fuels ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , 2005). Several mitigation options are currently being used in order to slow down the upward trend of greenhouse gas concentrations in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Carbon capture a nd storage (CCS) that consists of the separation of CO 2 from industrial and energy-related sources, transport and storage could play a major role in reducing greenhouse gas emi sions to the atmosphere ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , 2005). Geological CO2 storage in either oil or gas reservoirs, aquifers, and c oal beds, is currently being tested through several commercial or pilot projects. CO 2 has been used in the oil industry as a method to enhance the recovery of hydrocarbons (Blunt et al. , 1993) and this knowledge can be used to design safe storage i n other subsurface settings ( Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , 2005). This paper will focus on the storage of CO 2 in aquifers ( Bachu and Adams , 2003), as this is emerging as the storage option with the greatest potential, having the highest estimat ed capacity to store CO 2 in geological formations (upper estimates = 10 4 Gt CO2, lower estimates = 400 Gt CO 2; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , 2005). The first investigations related to CO2 storage in aquifers date from the early nineties, when V a der Meer and colleagues published studies regarding CO 2 storage in aquifers in the Netherlands ( Van der Meer et al, 1992; Van der Meer, 1995; Van der Meer, 1996). Several simulations and studies on CO 2 storage in aquifers have been performed during the last dec ade, focusing on different aspects and using different approaches (see, e.g., Kumar et al ., 2005; Juanes et al ., 2006; Pruess et al., 2003; Spiteri et al. , 2005; Van der Meer and Van Wees , 2003; Bachu and Adams , 2003; Ennis-King and Paterson ., 2002; Mo et al., 2005; Pruess and Garcia , 2002; Qi et al., 2009; Doughty and Pruess , 2004; Ennis-King and Paterson , 2005).

Recently an approach referred to as simulation decomposition (SD) has been introduced that extends the analysis of Monte Carlo results by enhancing the explanatory power of the cause-effect relationships between the multi-variable combinations of inputs and the simulated outputs. SD constructs sub-distributions of the simulation output by pre-classifying some of the uncertain input variables into states, clustering the various combinations of these different states into scenarios, and then collecting simulated outputs attributable to each multi-variable input scenario. Since the contribution of subdivided scenarios to the overall output is easily portrayed visually, SD can highlight and disclose previously unidentified connections between the multi-variable combinations of inputs on the outputs. An SD approach is generalizable to any Monte Carlo model with negligible additional computational overhead and, hence, can be readily used for environmental analyses that employ simulation models.

On the basis of this consideration, we successfully fabricated a cobalt (Co) and nitrogen (N) dual-doped porous carbon (Co@C-N) hybrid with multiple active sites by a facile strategy of combined hydrothermal reaction with thermolysis.

First, a new charging and discharging (C/D) strategy based on binary search method is designed for ES, which responds to system congestion cost over time. Then, a novel pricing method, based on locational marginal pricing (LMP), is designed for ES. The pricing model is derived by evaluating ES impact on the network power flows and congestions from the loss and congestion components in LMP. The impact is then converted into an hourly economic signal to reflect ES operation. The proposed ES C/D strategy and pricing methods are validated on a real local grid supply point area.

In the face of these transformations, many conventional electricity resource capacity expansion models are no longer adequate for rigorous decision support and policy analysis. This working paper describes the formulation of \u201cGenX,\u201d a highly-configurable electricity resource capacity expansion model that incorporates several state-of-the-art improvements in electricity system modeling to offer improved decision support for a changing electricity landscape. GenX is a constrained optimization model that determines the mix of electricity generation, storage, and demand-side resource investments and operational decisions to meet electricity demand in a future planning year at lowest cost subject to a variety of power system operational constraints and specified policy constraints, such as CO2 emissions limits. The appropriate level of model resolution with regards to chronological variability of electricity demand and renewable energy availability, power system operational detail and unit commitment constraints, and transmission and distribution network representation each vary for a given planning problem or policy question. As such, the GenX model is designed to be highly configurable, with several different degrees of resolution possible on each of these three key dimensions. The model is capable of representing a full range of conventional and novel electricity resources, including thermal generators, variable renewable resources (wind and solar), run-of-river, reservoir and pumped-storage hydroelectric generators, energy storage devices, demand-side flexibility, and several advanced technologies such as high temperature nuclear reactors and carbon capture and storage. Two optional modules also allow modeling of heat storage, industrial heat demand, and co-generation of heat and power; and distributed energy resources deployed at distribution voltages.

Additionally, all the Power-to-Fuel-to-Power systems have a lower environmental impact on climate change, photochemical ozone formation and fossil resource depletion compared with the natural gas with carbon capture and storage system. The natural gas with carbon capture and storage system has a lower environmental impact on particulate matter formation, marine eutrophication and mineral resource scarcity. Our work is complemented by an analysis of pathways from a net-zero-direct-CO2 to a life-cycle net-zero-CO2-equivalent power system which is actually climate neutral, achieved by direct air capture of the residual CO2 from the atmosphere. However, this leads to an increase in all other impact categories of 11% for the Power-to-Fuel-to-Power systems and 21% in the natural gas combustion with carbon capture and storage system.

Current targets are to have 50 million tonnes of CO2 stored annually by 2020 and 139 million tonnes annually by 2050. Of paramount importance to CCS is the ability to track CO2 plume movement, if possible, and to assess whether the CO2 flow is consistent with model predictions, and to optimise safeguards for possible early leak detection.

PyC is mainly produced as solid charred residues, including visually-defined charcoal, and a black carbon (BC) fraction chemically defined by its resistance to laboratory oxidation, plus much lower proportions of volatile soot and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). All PyC is characterized by fused aromatic rings, but varying in cluster sizes, and presence of other elements (N, O) and functional groups. There are several reasons for current interest in defining more precisely the role of PyC in the C cycle of boreal regions. First, PyC is resistant to decomposition, and therefore contributes to very stable C pools in soils and sediments. Second, it influences soil processes, mainly through its sorption properties and cation exchange capacity, and third, soot aerosols absorb solar radiation and may contribute to global warming. However, there are large gaps in the basic information needed to address these topics. While charcoal is commonly defined by visual criteria, analytical methods for BC are mainly based on various measures of oxidation resistance, or on yield of benzenepolycarboxylic acids. These methods are still being developed, and capture different fractions of the PyC \"continuum\". There are few quantitative reports of PyC production and stocks in boreal forests (essentially none for boreal peatlands), and results are difficult to compare due to varying experimental goals and methods, as well as inconsistent terminology. There are almost no direct field measurements of BC aerosol production from boreal wildfires, and little direct information on rates and mechanisms for PyC loss. Structural characterization of charred biomass and forest floor from wildfires generally indicates a low level of thermal alteration, with the bulk of the material having H/C ratios still >0.2, and small aromatic cluster sizes. For the more chemically-recalcitrant BC fraction, a variety of mainly circumstantial evidence suggests very slow decomposition, with turnover on a millennium timescale (5000?10 000 y), depending on environmental conditions and PyC properties, but the main limitation to PyC storage in soil is likely consumption by subsequent fires. Degraded, functionalized PyC is also incorporated into humified soil organic matter, and is transported to sediments in dissolved and particulate form. Boreal production is estimated as 7?17 Tg BC y?1 of solid residues and 2?2.5 Tg BC y?1 as aerosols. Primary research needs include basic field data on PyC production and stocks in boreal forests and peatlands, suitable to support C budget modeling, and development of standardized analytical methods and of improved approaches to assess the chemical recalcitrance of typical chars from boreal wildfires.

Soil water content (SWC) was significantly (P\u00a0< 0.05) higher in termitaria and fenced (un-grazed) plots. Higher soil nitrogen (N) content occurred in the Acacia, termitaria, and fenced plots while total biomass was highest in the fenced plot. The termitaria plots showed the highest net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (Reco), and gross primary production (GPP) and were the only plots that were net CO2 sinks. Except in fenced plots, maximum GPP was positively correlated with SWC and green biomass in all the other plots. Green biomass and Reco were positively correlated with SWC. Shifting cultivation (abandoned farmlands) negatively affected soil quality, ecosystem CO2 assimilation, and productivity. Removal of grazing (cattle) from the ecosystem negatively influenced GPP, while the presence of termitaria and Acacia trees facilitated soil water and N availability and ecosystem productivity. We concluded that soil water availability was responsible for most of the localized differences in the savanna and has a strong influence on ecosystem C capture and storage.

To date, various CO2 capture technologies including solvents, membranes, cryogenics, and solid adsorbents have been proposed. Currently, a liquid adsorption method for CO2 using amine solution (monoethanolamine) has been practically used. However, this liquid phase CO2 adsorption process requires heat regeneration, and it can cause many problems such as corrosion of equipment and degradation of the solution. Meanwhile, solid adsorption methods using porous materials are more advantageous over the liquid method at these points. In this context, we here evaluated if hydrogen titanate (H2Ti3O7) nanotubes and the surface modification effectively capture CO2. For this aim, we first developed a facile synthesis method of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes different from any conventional methods. Briefly, they were converted from the precursors-amorphous TiO2 nanoparticles at room temperature (25 \u00b0C). We then determined the outer and the inner diameters of the H2Ti3O7 nanotubes as 3.0 and 0.7 nm, respectively. It revealed that both values were much smaller than the reported ones; thus the specific surface area showed the highest value (735 m2/g). Next, the outer surface of H2Ti3O7 nanotubes was modified using ethylenediamine to examine if CO2 adsorption capacity increases. The ethylendiamine-modified H2Ti3O7 nanotubes showed a higher CO2 adsorption capacity (50 cm3/g at 0 \u00b0C, 100 kPa). We finally concluded that the higher CO2 adsorption capacity could be explained, not only by the high specific surface area of the nanotubes but also by tripartite hydrogen bonding interactions among amines, CO2, and OH groups on the surface of H2Ti3O7.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "aded56d87ca318b6fc983be6e29f289fde262ac6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2038850861", "DOI": "10.1115/IPC2012-90461", "CorpusId": 110146506}, "title": "The Decompression Behaviour of Carbon Dioxide in the Dense Phase", "abstract": "Pipelines can be expected to play a significant role in the transportation infrastructure required for the successful implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS).

These biogeochemical processes in turn determine N cycling under chronic N deposition. In order to examine connections between climate and N dynamics, we quantified decadal-scale water, C and N states and fluxes at annual, monthly and daily time steps for a California chaparral ecosystem in the Sierra Nevada using the DAYCENT model. The daily output simulations of net mineralization, stream flow and stream nitrate (NO3\u2212) export were developed for DAYCENT in order to simulate the N dynamics most appropriate for the abrupt rewetting events characteristic of Mediterranean chaparral ecosystems. Overall, the magnitude of annual modeled net N mineralization, soil and plant biomass C and N, nitrate export and gaseous N emission agreed with those of observations. Gaseous N emission was a major N loss pathway in chaparral ecosystems, in which nitric oxide (NO) is the dominant species. The modeled C and N fluxes of net primary production (NPP), N uptake and N mineralization, NO3\u2212 export and gaseous N emission showed both high inter-annual and intra-annual variability. Our simulations also showed dramatic fire effects on NPP, N uptake, N mineralization and gaseous N emission for three years of postfire. The decease in simulated soil organic C and N storages was not dramatic, but lasted a longer time. For the seasonal pattern, the predicted C and N fluxes were greatest during December to March, and lowest in the summer. The model predictions suggested that an increase in the N deposition rate would increase N losses through gaseous N emission and stream N export in the chaparral ecosystems of the Sierra Nevada due to changes in N saturation status. The model predictions could not capture stream NO3\u2212 export during most rewetting events suggesting that a dry-rewetting mechanism representing the increase in N mineralization following soil wetting needs to be incorporated into biogeochemical models of semi-arid ecosystems.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "1539788776deedd92ac6c0d90fea7f96d377bdbb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3092210451", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.0c02816", "CorpusId": 222217449, "PubMed": "33030339"}, "title": "Cost and Life-Cycle Greenhouse Gas Implications of Integrating Biogas Upgrading and Carbon Capture Technologies in Cellulosic Biorefineries.", "abstract": "Gaseous streams in biorefineries have been undervalued and underutilized.

Capturing CO2-rich streams generated in biorefineries can also contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation goals. We explore the economic and life-cycle GHG impacts of biogas upgrading and CO2 capture and storage (CCS) at ionic liquid-based cellulosic ethanol biorefineries using biomass sorghum. Without policy incentives, biorefineries with biogas upgrading systems can achieve a comparable minimum ethanol selling price (MESP) and reduced GHG footprint ($1.38/liter gasoline equivalent (LGE) and 12.9 gCO2e/MJ) relative to facilities that combust biogas onsite ($1.34/LGE and 24.3 gCO2e/MJ). Incorporating renewable identification number (RIN) values advantages facilities that upgrade biogas relative to other options (MESP of $0.72/LGE). Incorporating CCS increases the MESP but dramatically decreases the GHG footprint (-21.3 gCO2e/MJ for partial, -110.7 gCO2e/MJ for full CCS).

In these settings, fluid invades a porous medium saturated with an immiscible second fluid of different density and viscosity. The action of capillary forces in the porous medium results in spatial variations of the saturation of the two fluids. Here, we consider the propagation of fluid in a semi-infinite porous medium across a horizontal, impermeable boundary. In such systems, once the aspect ratio is large, fluid flow is mainly horizontal and the local saturation is determined by the vertical balance between capillary and gravitational forces. Gradients in the hydrostatic pressure along the current drive fluid flow in proportion to the saturation-dependent relative permeabilities, thus determining the shape and dynamics of two-phase currents. The resulting two-phase gravity current model is attractive because the formalism captures the essential macroscopic physics of multiphase flow in porous media. Residual trapping of CO2 by capillary forces is one of the key mechanisms that can permanently immobilize CO2 in the societally important example of geological CO2 sequestration. The magnitude of residual trapping is set by the areal extent and saturation distribution within the current, both of which are predicted by the two-phase gravity current model. Hence the magnitude of residual trapping during the post-injection buoyant rise of CO2 can be estimated quantitatively. We show that residual trapping increases in the presence of a capillary fringe, despite the decrease in average saturation.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "066c94b52fd2e232a31b5ea1d8b224fb4613e60a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1913936015", "DOI": "10.1144/0071061", "CorpusId": 129671061}, "title": "Unconventional oil and gas resources and the geological storage of carbon dioxide: overview", "abstract": "Abstract The \u2018Unconventional oil and gas resources and the geological storage of carbon dioxide\u2019 section of the Proceedings is designed to provide new insights from recent research and exploitation within these major growth areas in applied geology.

Accurately representing the response of ecosystems to environmental change in land surface models (LSMs) is crucial to making accurate predictions of future climate. Many LSMs do not correctly capture plant respiration and growth fluxes, particularly in response to extreme climatic events. This is in part due to the unrealistic assumption that total plant carbon expenditure (PCE) is always equal to gross carbon accumulation by photosynthesis. We present and evaluate a simple model of labile carbon storage and utilisation (SUGAR) designed to be integrated into an LSM, which allows simulated plant respiration and growth to vary independent of photosynthesis. SUGAR buffers simulated PCE against seasonal variation in photosynthesis, producing more constant (less variable) predictions of plant growth and respiration relative to an LSM that does not represent labile carbon storage. This allows the model to more accurately capture observed carbon fluxes at a large-scale drought experiment in a tropical moist forest in the Amazon, relative to the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator LSM (JULES). SUGAR is designed to improve the representation of carbon storage in LSMs and provides a simple framework that allows new processes to be integrated as the empirical understanding of carbon storage in plants improves.

At EU level, by 2030, 27 % of the energy requirements are expected to be covered by renewable energy sources, biomass being one of the most important sources. Also, for the same period, the greenhouse gas emissions are expected to be reduced by at least 40 % below the 1990 level. In this context, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are equally important for transition to low carbon economy. Chemical looping technique is a particular promising carbon capture option for reducing CO2 capture energy and cost penalties. This paper evaluates, from techno-economic and environmental perspective, the hydrogen and power cogeneration based on biomass direct chemical looping systems with total decarbonisation of the fuel. As illustrative example, an ilmenite-based chemical looping system was assessed to generate about 500 MW net electricity with a flexible hydrogen output in the range of 0 to 100 MWth (based on hydrogen LHV). The capacity of evaluated plant concept to produce flexible hydrogen output is an important aspect for integration in modern energy conversion systems in which flexible operation scenario is of great importance due to greater integration of high time-irregular renewable energy sources (e.g. solar, wind). The carbon capture rate of evaluated concepts is almost total (>99 %). In addition, considering biomass (e.g. sawdust, agricultural wastes etc.) processing, the investigated power plant concepts have negative fossil CO2 emissions. The performances are assessed for a number of case studies (including some benchmark cases) through process flow simulations.

The integration of these technologies into power plants results in a reduction in power generation efficiency, which remains one of the major issues for the commercial implementation of CCS.

This thesis is concerned with the development of new carbon capture processes that require less energy for CO2 separation and are, at the same time, more environmentally friendly. Prior to the development of any new process, the current state of the art needs to be analysed and updated in order to set realistic targets for the new technology and benchmark the potential of the newly developed processes. Therefore, part of the work of this thesis is a thorough benchmarking exercise in which updated baselines for the performance of conventional post-combustion capture processes are given. The new process concepts developed in this thesis are based on the combination of enhanced absorption and enhanced desorption, two effects encountered in capture processes that are based on precipitating amino acid solvents.

We suggest that pathways and scenarios have a \u2018world-making\u2019 power, potentially shaping the world in their own image and creating new political realities. Assessment bodies like the IPCC need to reflect on this power, and the implications of changing political contexts, in new ways. Technical summary Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement of December 2015, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has begun to reconsider its role in the climate regime. Based on work in Science and Technology Studies (STS), we reconstruct how the IPCC has historically positioned itself between climate science and policy-making. We then discuss particular challenges raised if the IPCC is shifting along the spectrum from attributing causes and detecting impacts of global warming towards projecting policy solutions, including emerging technologies, by examining recent controversies over negative emissions technologies (NETs). We conclude that the IPCC exercises a \u2018world-making\u2019 power by providing new, politically powerful visions of actionable futures, for example, based on speculative technologies of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). The task of providing future pathways poses great challenges to conventional ideals of scientific neutrality.
