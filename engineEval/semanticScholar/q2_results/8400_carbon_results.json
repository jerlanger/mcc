As a response to the Paris\nAgreement, the Swedish government in February 2017 presented a climate reform\nto make Sweden CO2 neutral by 2045, and even CO2 negative beyond 2045. This\nrequires extensive actions. One of the most required technical solutions is carbon\ncapture and storage (CCS). One way of implementing CCS in a cost-efficient manner\nis in form of partial CO2 capture, where only a fraction of the emissions are captured.\nAn important aspect of the Swedish energy system is the extensive use of waste\nincineration in combined heat and power (CHP) plants. This work evaluates the\npossibilities of making the Swedish waste fired CHP plants CO2 neutral by applying\npartial capture in order to capture the fossil share of the CO2 emissions.\nThis work investigates the implementation of carbon capture through a post-combustion\nabsorption process with monoethanolamine (MEA) as absorbent. Two design\nalternatives are evaluated for partial CO2 capture, based on either a high absorption\nrate for a fraction of the flue gas flow, or a low absorption rate for 100 % of the flue\ngas flow. The two designs are evaluated for a generic CHP plant, based on the average\nsize of a Swedish waste fired CHP plant. Also, a specific case of Lillesjoverket is\nanalyzed. Since seasonal variations in the heat load occur, both a constant annual\noperation and a seasonally optimized operation are considered for the design of the\npartial capture unit.\nThe results show that the generic plant, which have fossil CO2 emissions of 64 200\nton per year, have a specific cost of 94-98 EUR/ton CO2 for a constant annual operation\nof the capture unit, but that the specific cost may be decreased to 86 EUR/ton\nCO2 if a seasonal operation is applied. Due to the small size of the capture unit,\nthe capital cost is dominating and stands for more than 80 % of the specific cost.\nThe capture unit should, thus, be designed to minimize the capture cost.\nThe effect of implementing carbon capture on the other product streams of the CHP\nplant is significant, especially for Lillesjoverket that besides heat and electricity also\nproduces pellets. In case waste incineration should be made CO2-neutral, the other\nproducts have to be prioritized based on price and season in order to maximize\nthe revenue, and it can be concluded that the addition of a capture unit requires a\nsystem perspective analysis already in the planning and design phase.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "d90edb90ec318d05adfd52bc2eaae5ec13c34a79", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "3287142", "MAG": "2142963477", "DOI": "10.1186/1750-0680-6-11", "CorpusId": 3297064, "PubMed": "22070870"}, "title": "Assessment of carbon in woody plants and soil across a vineyard-woodland landscape", "abstract": "BackgroundQuantification of ecosystem services, such as carbon (C) storage, can demonstrate the benefits of managing for both production and habitat conservation in agricultural landscapes. In this study, we evaluated C stocks and woody plant diversity across vineyard blocks and adjoining woodland ecosystems (wildlands) for an organic vineyard in northern California. Carbon was measured in soil from 44 one m deep pits, and in aboveground woody biomass from 93 vegetation plots. These data were combined with physical landscape variables to model C stocks using a geographic information system and multivariate linear regression.ResultsField data showed wildlands to be heterogeneous in both C stocks and woody tree diversity, reflecting the mosaic of several different vegetation types, and storing on average 36.8 Mg C/ha in aboveground woody biomass and 89.3 Mg C/ha in soil. Not surprisingly, vineyard blocks showed less variation in above- and belowground C, with an average of 3.0 and 84.1 Mg C/ha, respectively.ConclusionsThis research demonstrates that vineyards managed with practices that conserve some fraction of adjoining wildlands yield benefits for increasing overall C stocks and species and habitat diversity in integrated agricultural landscapes. For such complex landscapes, high resolution spatial modeling is challenging and requires accurate characterization of the landscape by vegetation type, physical structure, sufficient sampling, and allometric equations that relate tree species to each landscape. Geographic information systems and remote sensing techniques are useful for integrating the above variables into an analysis platform to estimate C stocks in these working landscapes, thereby helping land managers qualify for greenhouse gas mitigation credits.

However, the extent to which these activities capture CO2 with associated climate mitigation impacts are poorly known, especially in geographies where data on biomass growth of restored forests are limited or do not exist. To fill this gap, we developed biomass accumulation rates for a set of FLR activities (natural regeneration, planted forests and woodlots, agroforestry, and mangrove restoration) across the globe and global CO2 removal rates with corresponding confidence intervals, grouped by FLR activity and region/climate.ResultsPlanted forests and woodlots were found to have the highest CO2 removal rates, ranging from 4.5 to 40.7 t CO2\u00a0ha\u22121\u00a0year\u22121 during the first 20\u00a0years of growth.

In future electricity systems, CCS power plants will be required to respond to the fluctuating supply of renewable energy by varying their output and through rapid shut-downs and start-ups [1]. This concept of flexible operation initially proposed by academics at the University of Edinburgh [1, 2] allows CCS plants to time-delay the financial and energy output penalty of carbon capture processes. Whilst the concept was developed for conventional fossil fuel power cycles with post-combustion capture, this project is the first to apply it to the Allam Cycle, a recent breakthrough in low-carbon energy generation. The Allam Cycle is an oxy-fired supercritical CO2 power cycle, currently undergoing pilot scale testing as part of a $140m scheme led by NET Power [3]. It is designed to produce zero carbon electricity at competitive efficiency and costs compared to unabated fossil fuel plants, thus exhibiting a step-change in performance compared to state of the art CCS power generation. In the Allam Cycle, shown in Figure 1, an Air Separation Unit produces oxygen which is combusted with natural gas, producing a high-pressure working fluid above 90% supercritical CO2 in volume, which is then used to drive an electricity generating turbine. Most of this CO2 is then compressed and fed back into the cycle, while surplus is removed at the required pressure and quality for pipeline transport. Thus, the cycle inherently captures all CO2 produced, without the expense of an add-on capture system. The potential for enhanced operational flexibility in the Allam Cycle arises from the opportunity to decouple the highly energy intensive step of oxygen production from power generation.

These include the sub-surface environment, the quality of the material to be injected, its behaviour during and after injection. Knowledge is required not only of the geological and chemical characteristics of the aquifer such as the profile of any existing native liquid material, but of the natural ecology of the soil into which product is to be injected and specific details of the composition of the liquid. Neither the soil nor the product for injection should be assumed to be inert or sterile. Some relationships between geological, chemical and microbiological constituents will occur if only though dint of close contact and the nature of these interactions needs understanding if, as in the instance of artificial injection, a change in existing natural conditions is involved. Storage and reuse of wastewater for the growing metropolis of Sydney has been suggested as a way of capturing and reusing wastewater currently being disposed through ocean outfalls. The present paper examines some of the concerns in the deep injection of treated wastewater for reclamation-reuse purposes. This technology, termed aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) has already been tested in a 5year experiment at the Andrews Farm site on the North Adelaide Plains of South Australia (Barry et al, 2002). The current paper in particular, focuses on three aspects of using ASR for water conservation purposes in the Sydney region. The approach is: (i) an overview of geological data on Sydney region comparing two hypothetical sites the Bald Hill Claystone and the Botany Sands aquifer (ii) attention to issues of a hydrogeochemical and microbiological nature that could impact on groundwater in an aquifer if deep injection of wastewater is undertaken; and (iii) foreshadowing methods which could be used to learn more about microbial populations and behaviour in the aquifer after injection of treated wastewater. Aquifer Sites in the Sydney Basin There has been interest in ASR for some years in government circles, at the Department of Sustainable Natural Resources, formerly the Department of Land and Water Conservation (DLWC) and Sydney Water. There has already been debate among academics about using ASR techniques for water conservation and recycling to service an increasing demand for water by the rapidly expanding urban metropolis of Sydney and the associated regions. Such initiatives have been successfully adopted in USA and more recently in Singapore for reuse projects. In an attempt to lay the foundation to advance such a Project, researchers at the National Center for Groundwater Management at University of Technology, Sydney examined the suitability of the Sydney Metropolitan Area in the Sydney Geological Basin for receipt and storage. Pawelczyk (2002) provided an extensive and thorough examination of the geology and hydrology of the southern portion within these boundaries. Using criteria identified by previous researchers (Corkery, 1978), Pawelczyk was able to reject a number of recognized stratigraphic sectors within the Sydney Basin (see Figure 1) as being unsuitable for deep injection and storage of water. A variety of reasons were given ranging from the nature of the sediment, to closeness to known coal resources, to tendency towards grain suturing and/or quartz and clay cementation which would eliminate virtually all primary porosity, a necessary requirement for ASR (pawelczyk, 2002). Nevertheless, Pawelczyk identified two regions, Botany and Campbelltown which contained hydrogeologically suitable formations. The former contains the Botany Sands Aquifer while the latter includes the Bald Hill Claystone. The properties of the Botany Sands Aquifer are much better known than those of the Bald Hill Claystone. From the available data, Pawelcyzk concluded that it should be possible to exploit a portion of the 18300 hectare Botany Sands aquifer (total capacity approximately 170,000ML) for artificial aquifer storage and recovery (ASR). This suggestion however, was not without its problems. Botany Basin Sands vs Bald Hill Claystone Three host lithologies for groundwater resources are evident in map notes accompanying the Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment Groundwater Availability Map (Krumins, Bradd and McKribbin, 1998). Unconsolidated sediments, porous rocks and fractured rocks predominate. Of these, unconsolidated sediments and porous rocks sedimentary rocks of sandstone, sandy shale and shale which are inherently porous in nature yield low salinity groundwater at varying levels but with low yields. The Botany Sands aquifer favoured by Pawelczyk covers an area in the northern part of the Botany Basin. This area is constituted of unconsolidated sands, clays and peats. It is an unconfmed aquifer and, according to DLWC (2000), the aquifer is currently the only significant source of groundwater within 45 kilometres of Sydney. Existing data indicates that Bald Hill claystone and siltstone, predominantly composed of kaolinite (approx 75%) are the main geological features with quartz, haematite, siderite and goethite present in lesser proportions. Unlike the Botany area, the aquifer here is overlaid and confmed potentially making it easier to conduct a focused study on the behaviour of groundwater over time and the impact of injected material. Further: The Botany area is well settled with houses, units and some high rise residential occupying approximately 74% available above-ground area. An additional 12% is assigned to industry including industrial and agricultural chemical manufactures and petroleum related business. In the past, the industry and manufacturing businesses were inclined to draw substantial amounts of groundwater from the Botany Sands aquifer beneath resulting in fluctuations in water table particularly with increased surface inflow during prolonged wet weather. These fluctuations in the water table have been monitored via a series of groundwater monitoring wells in the northern, southern and western regions of the Basin (Fish et aI, 2000). As people have displaced industry in the Botany area over the past few years, industrial draw down of the underlying groundwater has been reduced considerably and the water balance in the aquifer beneath has stabilized. Conditions in the Sub-Surface Conditions in an aquifer and the general environment deep in the sub-surface would affect the wastewater, organisms still present in it and any other suspended material. They, in tum will impact existing sub-surface conditions and biota. Changes that would be anticipated depend on: (i) Oxygen levels in the aquifer. Different species of microbes survive and reproduce under aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic conditions in an aquifer. And the deeper the aquifer, the lower the percentage of oxygen available for life. (ii) A carbon or organic carbon sources introduced as suspended or colloidal material with wastewater which can act as a food source for anaerobes as well as aerobes. Existing species in the aquifer which mayor may not have been active prior to the introduction of wastewater may begin to reproduce and multiply. (iii) Temperature. While latitude of a site and geology are important, temperature in the soil, like oxygen, falls with depth from the surface. The presence of water can affect temperature as the water in soil can freeze thereby restricting movement and life. (iv) The existence of pores, cracks and fractures between soil particles can provide tiny pockets for air and water as well as a niche habitat for microbes as earlier discussed. (v) pH. Wastewater tends to have a higher pH than rain water (pH around 4.3) and other infiltrates which may percolate through the soil to reach the native groundwater. (vi) Research undertaken by Lovley and Goodwin (1988) and others suggest that there are discrete zones in the soil sub-surface where survival of a population is dependent as much on the availability of minerals in the soil, including pollutant residues and their chemistry Activity after Injection Conditions in the sub-surface and at the groundwater table, after injection of wastewater into a confined aquifer will show the impact of the injected liquor after a reasonably short period of time after allowing for mixing and settlement. Using data from a typical wastewater treatment plant in the Sydney area (Table 1 Malabar STP), it could reasonably be presumed that coliform, enterococci and other species present in the discharge will face different and challenging conditions in the cold, low oxygen environment of a deep aquifer. Unless break-point chlorination is practised and this is not the case at Malabar STP it could reasonably be presumed that many of these and other species would be present in the discharge effluent which would be injected into the aquifer. Competition for nutrients and carbon substrates between species such that one becomes dominant would distort the chemical and microbial balance achieved under normal pre-injection conditions. Changes of this nature would impact on water quality, potential for re-draw for reuse and possibly also technical issues associated with re-draw processes. Just to detail some of the other issues: {a) Sorption Studies on Aquifer Sediments Sorption between a dissolved and particulate phase in aquifer systems is important for a wide range of organics, inorganics and metals. In the literature, organic carbon is recognized as the principal sorbent compartment for hydrophobic organic chemicals in aquatic systems. The partitioning potential of a chemical is characterized by its organic carbon partition coefficient. Mineral surfaces contain oxide functional groups that give the surface a pH-dependent charge and that can be involved in electrostatic and ligand-exchange reactions. The mineral surfaces may contain pores of varying sizes.

Nevertheless, more and more effort is necessary in order to produce energy and chemicals from renewables as a strategy for replacing fossil fuels and reducing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In particular, methanol is considered as a promising energetic vector of the future since it may be produced from renewables and it may be used as a reactant for fuels and chemical production. Currently, methanol is industrially produced via syngas conversion using natural gas as the main feedstock.

The energy-storing embodiment of cryogenic carbon capture (ESCCC) integrates energy storage with cryogenic carbon capture and uses natural gas as a refrigerant. ES-CCC captures CO2 from slowly varying or steady-state sources even as it absorbs and replaces large amounts of energy on the grid for energy storage. These large transients occur in the LNG generation as the process moves through energy storing to energy recovery operations. Additionally, raw natural gas often includes CO2 that forms an azeotrope with ethane. Breaking this azeotrope and separating CO2 from other hydrocarbons to meet natural gas pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) standards is very energy intensive. The purpose of this work is to (a) describe a dynamic heat exchanger that reduces the heat exchanger performance and efficiency losses experienced under transient conditions and (b) introduce an alternative extractive distillation system for CO2 separation from ethane that requires less capital and has a lower operating cost than the conventional system for the same purification. This investigation demonstrates theoretically and experimentally that the dynamic heat exchangers can absorb sudden and large changes in flow rates and other properties without compromising either the heat exchanger efficiency or creating thermal or other stresses. These heat exchangers play an essential role in the ES-CCC process. Designs for retrofitting existing heat exchangers and for replacing existing heat exchangers with new designs are both theoretically and experimentally tested. The ES-CCC process requires natural gas processing to meet pipeline and LNG standards in many applications, depending primarily on the CO2 content of locally available NG. The energy, cost, and dynamic response of such processing hinges primarily on the most difficult step, breaking the CO2-ethane azeotrope. This project proposes and analyzes an alternative process for breaking this azeotrope and a control scheme that dramatically improves the dynamic response of natural gas processing plants, including steady and transient control scheme and processing simulations. These contributions to the ES-CCC capture process all have much broader applications in many chemical and energy processes. These contributions to ES-CCC and other industrial processes improve energy efficiency and dynamic performance of many processes and are ready for larger scale demonstration.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "edc4cade3f129ddcf4829a35f8568c7a3e706e9e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3130354217", "DOI": "10.1088/1757-899X/1037/1/012045", "CorpusId": 234017943}, "title": "The wastewater using in technologies of bio-oil production from microalgae: CO2 capture and storage", "abstract": "Bioenergy remains the largest renewable energy industry.

The endosymbiotic chloroplast is the cellular location for most of this metabolism in plants, but some additional metabolism occurs in the cytosol to make the sugars that will be transported around the plant, mainly sucrose and also sugar alcohols, such as sorbitol and manitol. There are many processes that can properly be called photosynthesis, but a core set of processes underlie most of the considerations in this book. This chapter will provide an overview of those processes, and many topics covered in this chapter are the subject of more in-depth chapters later on. This chapter begins by describing the initial capture and temporary storage of light energy as highly reactive molecules (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP)) on carbon. By reducing (i.e., by adding electrons to) carbon from its most oxidised state (CO2) to the status of sugars (CH2O)n, the energy initially stored as NADPH and ATP can be stored on the carbon. Additional energy can be stored on each carbon atom by reducing it fully, as happens in the synthesis of oils (R-CH2-R), but this is generally not considered when describing photosynthesis. Finally, issues surrounding uptake of the CO2 will be addressed. Photochemistry Synopsis Photochemistry, the capture of light energy and its conversion to chemical energy suitable for reducing CO2 to sugar, is the source of nearly all energy available to living things. Energy captured by absorbing molecules is stored as the high-energy intermediates NADPH (reducing power) and ATP (sometimes called the energy currency of the cell).", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "6d52718467367b7eb1cc6576bf63dc700464f2ea", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2170264089", "DOI": "10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.295-298.2223", "CorpusId": 110940579}, "title": "The Analysis of the Necessity and Feasibility of Carbon Dioxide Storage in China", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a significant strategic climate protection technology, and has become the most possibility and practical significance approach of emission reduction.

Pipeline transport is the most economical solution when it comes to transporting large quantities of CO2 over moderate distances. CO2 compression differs from most fluid compression tasks due to the high molecular weight, highly compressible behavior and the presence of the so called critical point. At the critical point, the difference between the liquid and the gaseous fluid phase disappears. Technically, CO2 can be transported by pipelines in the form of gas, a supercritical fluid or in the subcooled liquid state. In this work, the CO2 working area was assumed to be either in the liquid or in the supercritical state and results for these two states were compared. It is most cost-effective if CO2 is in the dense phase i.e. under the liquid or supercritical regime (Fig. 2.1). This is due to the lower friction drop along the pipeline per unit mass of CO2 compared to transmitting CO2 as a gas or as a two-phase gas/liquid combination. The commercially available ASPEN PLUS simulation tool with a pipe model was used to determine the maximum safe pipeline distances to subsequent booster stations as a function of carbon dioxide inlet pressure, ambient temperature and the ground level heat flux parameters under three conditions: isothermal, adiabatic and with heat transfer. In the following discussion, the same power station data will be used as reported in Chap. 3: a 900 MW pulverized coal-fired power plant with 90 % CO2 captured (156.43 kg/s) and the monoethanolamine absorption (MEA) method of CO2 separation from flue gases. The results show that transporting a subcooled liquid maximizes energy efficiency and minimizes the cost of CO2 transport over long distances under isothermal, adiabatic and heat transfer conditions. After CO2 is compressed and boosted to above 9 MPa, its temperature is usually higher than ambient but the thermal insulation layer slows down the CO2 temperature decrease process, increasing the pressure drop in the pipeline. Therefore in Poland, considering the atmospheric conditions, the thermal insulation layer should not be laid on the external surface of the pipeline.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "ba2eaf69af6beeba04d5aafba5bf3cb9c86f9731", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3123182573", "DOI": "10.1080/02646811.2011.11435268", "CorpusId": 219296842}, "title": "Long-term Liability for Geological Carbon Storage in the European Union", "abstract": "Long-term liability for carbon capture and storage (CCS) is highly debated and is seen as one of the core issues for regulators to deal with.

This is especially true of the rain fed crop productions systems that often face water \nstress resulting from agricultural droughts (short but critical periods during the growing season). \nThe \u201cAmenagement en courbes de niveau\u201d or ACN practice holds promise to increase crop \nyields, sequester more carbon, and increase local groundwater recharge. The practice is \nbasically contour farming, but the soil is tilled in a manner that permanent ridges are formed \nalong the contour with valleys between the ridges (see Figure 1). Field studies have shown ACN \nincreases crop yield in excess of 50% for millet, sorghum and maize (Gigou et al. 1997). Also, \nincreases of soil organic carbon upwards of 12% to 26% have been recorded in ACN fields \n(Doumbia et al., 2006). Soil organic carbon increases led to increased fertilizer efficiency, water \nholding capacity, and permeability of the sandy soils found in much of Mali (Doumbia et al., \n2006). \nThe main environmental service from ACN that was investigated in this study was the potential \nincrease in recharge of local groundwater sources and reduction surface runoff. There has been \nmuch anecdotal evidence from discussions with farmers about these impacts on water \nmanagement due to ACN (Gigou et al., 1999). This anecdotal evidence needs to be verified \nthrough assessment of field water balances. \nTraditional runoff plot studies were not possible given costs and lack of institutional capabilities \nof the Institut d\u2019Economie Rurale (IER) of Mali; therefore, field water balance calculations using \nsoil moisture measurements were used to investigate the effect of the ACN on runoff and deep \npercolation occurring in agricultural fields. Two treatments were applied near Siguidolo, Mali \nincluding ACN and a control. A capacitance based soil moisture probe was used to record soil \nmoisture vertically from 10 cm to 160 cm in two replications of 6 tubes per plot. Readings were taken by L\u2019Institut d\u2019Economie Rurale (IER) of Mali technicians on a daily basis during the \ngrowing season from June to September and once a month during the dry season. The soil \nmoisture observations collected were used in addition to readily available meteorological data to \nconduct water balance calculations for fields with and without ACN. \nThe water balance calculations considered all the major hydrologic processes at the field scale. \nThe procedures used to estimate the field water balance in this study were based on the \nprocedures used by Paramasivam et al. (2001). Precipitation and soil moisture were measured \ndirectly. Soil evaporation and crop ET (Allen et al., 1998) were estimated using potential \nevaporation calculations (Thornthwaite, 1948). Soil water storage was estimated from the soil \nmoisture measurements in the root zone. Deep percolation was calculated using soil moisture \nmeasurements below the root zone, pedo-transfer functions (Young et al., 1998; Vereecken et \nal., 1989) and Darcy\u2019s equation (Van Genutchen, 1980). Finally, runoff was calculated using a \nmass balance equation that considers each of the processes influencing the field water balance. \nThe relative differences between the treatment and control for deep percolation and runoff were \nused rather than the magnitude of these values. There is much uncertainty in the magnitudes. \nHowever, the accuracy of the relative difference was considered sufficient for comparison \nbecause the errors resulting from the calculations would cancel out when the relative error was \ncalculated. \nThe field water balance calculations quantified positive impacts of ACN on deep percolation and \nrunoff. The ACN fields generally had greater deep percolation and lower runoff than the fields \nwithout ACN (Figure 2). Generally, the ACN field tended to percolate more water than the \ncontrol during each rainy season. There were large precipitation events in June-July 2003. For \nthese events, more precipitation was converted to deep percolation for the ACN fields than the \ncontrol. For the entire monitoring period, there was 132% more deep percolation from fields with \nACN than fields without. Overall, there were large reductions in runoff from the fields in ACN \ncompared to the control. For both replications, there was less runoff produced from the ACN \nfields than the control (Figure 2). As with deep percolation, the large precipitation events that \noccurred in June-July 2003 produced less runoff from the ACN fields compared to the control. \nThe fields with ACN produced 94% less runoff than the fields using conventional farming \npractices (Figure 2). \nIncreasing deep percolation on agricultural fields is important for both local water resource \nmanagement and larger concerns like cash crop production and revenue increases. The \nincrease in deep percolation will also increase the recharge of local groundwater resources, \nwhich villagers rely on through wells as their sole drinking water source. Also, reductions in \nsurface runoff and the re-direction of that water into the ground will reduce the potential \ndisturbance and loss of soil, hence increasing the potential of carbon sequestration and \nimproving soil fertility. Finally, through this investigation the institutional capacity of IER in Mali \nwas increased by training and involving technicians in the collection of the soil moisture data \nand scientists in the calculation of the field water balance, which is essential for the continuation \nand improvement of water resource management in Mali.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "f08a0ca4e15437469fc46896ad70c538dd826fb5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "656185026", "CorpusId": 92687946}, "title": "Viability of Storage Options of CO2 in Ca Silicates", "abstract": "Satisfying continuously growing world energy demand by use of fossil fuels has increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration in the atmosphere. Dramatically higher concentration of the CO2 has a negative environmental impact, for that reason a need for analyzing possible mitigation options has arisen. The research framework on the mitigation options includes conducting studies on capturing the CO2 and its permanent and safe disposal via mineral carbonation. Mineral carbonation of wollastonite (CaSiO3) appears to be the most promising sequestration option for CO2 fixation on silicate minerals: its reaction rate is considered faster than for the other minerals such as magnesium silicates or basalts. This report investigates a direct aqueous route of mineral carbonation of wollastonite under elevated pressure and temperature. Choice of the wollastonite was made based on its high reactivity rate and the method was determined by a catalytic effect of water on the adsorption kinetics. To improve the process and limit duration of the step where CO2 diffuses in solution before attaining the solid surface, most of the experiments were dedicated to carry in a moistened sample. As a result it could benefit from the catalytic effect of water and transport of CO2 was fast enough due to pressure equilibration. To investigate the influence of the water content of the sample, the experiments for this research were carried out with different water fractions. The idea of the direct aqueous wollastonite carbonation was studied experimentally. For this purpose a set-up was designed and built. It comprised of a closed system with a reference cell, a sample cell and tubing. The whole set-up was placed in a thermal reactor to achieve elevated temperature conditions. Sample represented by mixture of water and CaSiO3 was stirred until obtaining homogeneous slurry. The slurry contained 50 v/v% of water for the samples with the highest saturation. The unsaturated sample contained 20% of water. After introducing of CO2 to the reference cell and opening a valve connecting with sample cell, pressure started to decrease until reaching an equilibrium pressure. The pressure decrease in the set-up was monitored by a pressure device. In addition a dedicated reactive diffusion model was built to interpret the experimental results. The reaction rate for the adsorbed phase and the free phase is proportional to the deviation from equilibrium, which is given by the Langmuir isotherm. A comparison between the experiment and the model leads to the determination of the reaction rate parameters. The research on the direct aqueous mineral carbonation led to the following results: the maximum adsorption is 493 kg/m3; amount of water and particle sizes have the strongest influence on the carbonation process; water behaves as a catalyst, however it may limit the conversion rate in time; the direct aqueous carbonation is a complex heterogeneous reaction that involves dissolution, nucleation, interface reaction and mass transfer.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "33e44d9245e7fe475936737b1f3d5a27bc422718", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2612768278", "CorpusId": 114571450}, "title": "THERMODYNAMIC STUDY OF SO2/O2 AND SO2/N2 SYSTEMS FROM EXPERIMENTS AND MONTE CARLO MOLECULAR SIMULATIONS.", "abstract": "In CCS (Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage) operations, the captured CO2 stream from industrial installations is a contaminated CO2: it contains: SO2, NOx, H2S, N2, O2, Ar...

As a result, entirely new markets for CFRCs emerged to take advantage of the unbeatable strength/weight properties, primarily in the sporting goods industry. Today`s market is much more varied, with applications appearing in infrastructure, industrial and mechanical components, and alternative energy and transportation systems. In fact, carbon fiber-reinforced composites are enabling the technologies for the myriad of new alternative energy and transportation systems in development. Compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquid natural gas (LNG) tanks are filament wound from carbon fiber, which provides the lightweight/high strength construction necessary for efficient energy storage. Similarly, carbon fiber flywheels allow higher rotor speeds for greater energy storage capability. Lightweight carbon fiber-reinforced windmill blades, are in development with longer chord lengths for greater energy capture.

The results show that with regard to internal carbon prices the additional total system cost compared to potential external carbon prices stays within 9%, 15%, and 59% for Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom, respectively. The increase in the energy system cost in each country varies between 3% and 93%. For all countries, the cost differences can be reduced by allowing the installation of renewables.

The model accounts for all the important processes governing the fracture propagation process including the fluid/wall heat transfer, the resulting localised pressure stresses in the pipe wall as well as the initial defect geometry. Real fluid behaviour is considered using the modified Peng Robinson equation of state. Hypothetical but nevertheless realistic failure scenarios involving the transportation of gas and dense phase CO2 using existing natural gas steel pipelines are simulated using the model. The impacts of the pipe wall thickness, Ductile-Brittle-Transition Temperature (DBTT), initial defect geometry, feed temperature, stream impurities, surrounding backfill as well as flow isolation on brittle fracture propagation behaviour are investigated. In all circumstances, the initial defect geometry in the pipeline is shown to have a major impact on the pipeline\u2019s propensity to brittle fracture propagation. For example, in the case of an initial through-wall defect in the form of a circular puncture where there is no stress concentration, fracture propagation is highly unlikely. The opposite applies to an elliptical through-wall defect embodying a hairline crack extending from its side. Furthermore, gas-phase CO2 pipelines are more prone to brittle fracture failures as compared to dense-phase CO2 pipelines despite the higher starting pressure. This is due to the higher degree of expansion-induced cooling for gaseous CO2. The emergency isolation of the initial flow in the pipeline following the formation of the initial defect promotes brittle fracture. For the ranges tested, typical CO2 stream impurities are shown to have negligible impact on brittle fracture behaviour.

With this research project, we aim to develop a framework for quantitative evaluation of existing and proposed carbon-capture technologies. This framework is based on an exergy-based systems analysis performed at the local (system) level and at the global (life cycle) level, and a techno-economic evaluation of the technology. At the system level, work to date has focused on a few key components. First, the work has focused on building an exergetic analysis of amine-based post-combustion capture systems using the NETL baseline CCS systems as guidance. Second, the work has been focused on completing and documenting the exergetic analysis of the adsorption-based CCS system discussed in prior progress reports. At the life-cycle level, work to date has focused on two tasks: (1) the development of custom-written Matlab code for exergetic life cycle calculations, using data from the Ecoinvent Data v3 life cycle assessment database; and (2) applying this code to models of two fossil-fuel based power plants from the NETL baseline to demonstrate the functionality of the code. This update presents final results for the application to NETLcompliant amine-based absorption in post-combustion capture from coal-fired systems. Introduction: Proposed project goals With this research project, we aimed to answer the set of questions: What technologies or combination of technologies can provide CO2 capture at energy costs much closer to underlying thermodynamic limits? Are the conditions and technology configurations required to achieve such efficiencies possible with available or foreseeable materials? What are the broader (i.e., full system) environmental implications of such technology implementations? What are the likely costs of these technologies? And, given all of the above considerations, which technologies are likely to supply practical, costcompetitive electricity with low life-cycle CO2 emissions? We proposed to address these questions by examining four types of carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems with different characteristics. Each of the four CCS technologies would be evaluated on three bases: (1) an exergetic systems analysis so that the evaluation takes place with respect to absolute, thermodynamic limits; (2) a full lifecycle basis such that all ancillary exergy consumption and destruction across the economy\u2014both embodied components and in-process interactions with the environment\u2014are included; and (3) a techno-economic analysis of the technology such that technology options can be evaluated via economic metrics as well. The systems include one baseline option\u2014namely, a MEA-based reference system such as the one studied by NETL [1]\u2014for calibration of methodology, and three advanced technologies. The advanced technologies were chosen in conjunction with GCEP to represent the range of CCS options, and to complement the work of other GCEP research groups. They include one metal-organic framework (MOF) based adsorption system, one biomimetic sorbent, and one ionic liquids absorption system. Our proposed three-part analysis would have resulted in three metrics for each system: work-specific exergy consumption, work-specific carbon emissions to the atmosphere, and first-order estimates of levelized cost of electricity (where the work is the output of the associated power plant, as reduced by the added carbon-capture system). Each of these metrics can be defined on a local (system-only) and global (life cycle) basis. In order to arrive at these metrics, we will be generating exergy distribution plots of each system. These are plots which show the magnitude of exergy destruction in each sub-process in the system, which can both help us understand the inherent inefficiencies in the system and, in the future, to target the most inefficient sub-systems for improvement. The end goal of this project is not only to provide accurate analyses of selected carbon-capture options, but to frame the comparisons of these options in a coherent, compelling way. In the final section of this progress update, we will discuss our overall progress toward addressing all of these proposed goals. Background (re-capitulated from 2014 progress report) Despite growing concerns about climate change, it is very likely that carbon-based fuels will continue to be used in the coming decades for base-load power generation and for firming of intermittent renewable power sources. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is therefore a necessary part of any comprehensive strategy for achieving required reductions in carbon emissions to the atmosphere. Significant studies of proposed carbon capture systems have been performed, including those produced as part of the IPCC process [2], those produced by the U.S. DOE [1], those from the IEA [3], and numerous academic and industrial analyses [4], [5], [6]. These studies arrive at the common conclusion that existing options for post-combustion carbon capture lead to a significant loss of plant output (as much as 30%) and a significant rise in cost of electricity (as much as 80%) when compared to a similar plant without carbon capture. These numbers might be deemed acceptable\u2014perhaps even unavoidable\u2014were it not for the fact that thermodynamic limits suggest that much more efficient processes are possible. Considered in terms of the minimum work required to separate carbon dioxide generated by combustion of natural gas from its flue gas at atmospheric pressure, only a 2.4% loss of plant output is actually required [7]. Note that even after compressing the CO2 to 100 bar (the pressure prescribed by NETL for use in comparing separation options, [1]), the fraction of exergy required has only risen to 3.5%. These figures illustrate a key point: Assuming an exergy efficiency of ~50% for the overall plant, it should be possible to develop a separation methodology that meets NETL specifications while incurring only a 7% loss of plant output. This leads to a need to analyze the performance of carbon capture systems via an exergy analysis, in order to compare their operation to this thermodynamic baseline. The objective of this type of analysis is to understand the distribution of exergy within a system such that the causes of its destruction are exposed and quantified. With the exergy distribution of a plant or process known, not only is its overall quality assessed with respect to a fundamental, absolute yardstick, but the locations and magnitudes of losses are revealed for inspection (and thereby improvement). Exergy analysis provides both an unambiguous assessment and immediately points the way to process improvement. For two reasons, we chose to begin our systems analysis with an adsorption system. The first reason is that two of our advanced carbon capture systems are adsorption-based (the MOF system and the biomimetic sorbent system). The second reason, which became clearer as we advanced in the project, is that very little had been done previously in developing the tools necessary for performing exergy analyses of adsorption-based gas separation systems (whereas absorption-based systems have been studied more extensively). Therefore, our progress on this topic has consisted of two complementary efforts: the development of a generalized and thermodynamically rigorous understanding of the exergy of adsorbed species and mixtures, and the application of this new understanding to an adsorption system model for CO2 capture from flue gas. Our research takes the analysis beyond the local system level by incorporating global effects in the comparison of carbon capture systems. Using results from the exergetic systems analysis, we are conducting a life-cycle assessment (LCA) in order to better understand how a given CCS technology interacts with the environment at broad scales. This assessment includes not only direct energy consumption (i.e., exergy consumption) at a facility, but also the exergy destruction associated with all \u201cembodied\u201d materials and components, as well as the operational interactions with the environment. The goal of this analysis is to understand which technology option results in the smallest disruption to the environment and results in the smallest drawdown of valuable energy and material resources (e.g., exergy stores) across the entire supply chain. This will enable a better understanding of the tradeoffs between using sophisticated material inputs (which often require more embodied energy inputs) and reducing energy impacts on site. A number of LCAs have been performed of CCS technologies [8], [9], [10]. These LCAs serve to situate a CCS technology within the broader industrial ecosystem, tracking all material and energy flows both upstream and downstream of a technology of interest. In our case, this set of material and energy flows is utilized in an exergetic approach to LCA [11], [12], [13]. Several professional LCA datasets exist, such as the GaBi databases or the U.S. LCI database. After an overview of the available options, we chose to purchase the Ecoinvent Data life cycle assessment database, commissioned by the 1 For example, the exergy efficiency of a modern (F-class) NGCC power plant is ~52%. Swiss Centre for Life Cycle Inventories. The selection was based largely on the accessible nature of the raw database files, from which we could construct and manipulate individual matrices and perform exergetic life-cycle assessments without the utilization of a third-party LCA software package.

considerations for the design of flexibly operated Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) pipeline networks and is based on the findings of the Flexible CCS Network Development project (FleCCSnet), funded as part of the UK CCS Research Centre. The project considered the impact of flexibility across the whole CCS chain, as well as studying the interfaces between each element of the system; e.g. at the entry to the pipeline system from the capture plant and at the exit from the pipeline to the storage site. The factors identified are intended to allow CCS network designers to determine the degree of flexibility in the system; allowing them to react effectively to short, medium and long term variations in the flow of CO2 from capture plants and the constraints imposed on the system by CO2 injection and storage. The work of the project is reviewed in this paper which explores the flexibility of power plants operating with post combustion capture systems; quantifies the available time to store (line pack) CO2 in the pipeline as a function of pipeline size, the inlet mass flow rate and operating pressure; and explores the influence that uncertainty in injection and storage parameters have on the design of the pipeline. In addition, parameters influencing short and longer term network designs are discussed in terms of varying flow rates. Two practitioner workshops [1, 2] contributed to the direction of the project.

Such scenarios often include large-scale deployment of bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) as a possibility to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Substantial impact on direct and indirect land use change is to be expected. This thesis examines biomass feedstock potentials and assess bioenergy expansion at global, regional and local scales. For the global level it is argued that only the integration of multi-level assessments using top-down and bottom up approaches will help identifying realistic bioenergy potentials at high geographic resolutions. While the demand for bioenergy from Integrated Assessment Models can serve as a target, the combination of biophysical and economic land use models can help breaking this down into realizable and sustainable potentials on the ground. This thesis goes all the way from global bioenergy feedstock assessment under different protection and conservation scenarios to a conservative and environmentally sound assessment of bioenergy potentials on regional levels. The regional analyis concentrates on Korea and Japan. Finally, at the local level, the public opinion of rural town citizens in Japan with respect to sustainable forest management, forest certification and forestbased bioenergy are investigated. The motivation behind this is to examine to which extent success strategies from Austria can be replicated in Japan, which is similar to Austria in terms of forest and geographical situation. At the global level, this thesis finds that 160 million hectares of forest might be lost by 2050 for increased energy production if no sustainability safeguards like REDD policies will be applied. For the local level, the thesis states that there is a large bioenergy potential for Korea and Japan, even though the BECCS potentials seem to be limited under the presented methodologies. For the local level, the thesis concludes that sustainable forest management can also be an entry point for a bioenergy-driven rural revitalization strategy. Forest owners in rural Japanese towns show good knowledge on forest certification. Sustainable forest management based on forest certification ensures that economic and environmental goals can be achieved in unison. Especially, investment in forest infrastructure is among the main elements to ensure competitive harvesting costs in mountainous areas of Japan. It is concluded that different bottomup measures including capacity building and awareness raising need to be developed.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "f3f5371151f7a4c1f45179e4100c8fbc7e735ad1", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 199555077}, "title": "Design and Operation Optimisation of a MEA-based CO 2 Capture Unit", "abstract": "The present thesis has the objective of analysing the cost reduction obtained through a rigorous model-based optimisation of a post-combustion CO2 capture plant for carbon capture and storage applications. Presently, capture technology is mainly based on chemical absorption with alkanolamines. Even though this is a well-known technology, its application in power plants presents high costs, thus limiting its implementation. This way, a full scale capture plant model was developed considering MEA as the solvent. This model is based on a conventional flowsheet and was implemented in gPROMS, using the gCCS libraries. It comprises an absorption section, in which CO2 is dissolved by reacting with the amine, and a regeneration section where it is stripped from the solvent. After its validation, the model was optimised by modifying the design and operation parameters. A cost estimation model was applied to the plant model, in order to determine capital and operational expenditures. From the total cost obtained, 69% is due to the steam required in the regeneration section. As for the equipment cost, the absorber packing is the most relevant fraction. Considering typical values for the capture rate, CO2 purity and MEA concentration in the solvent as constraints, the plant\u2019s model optimisation led to a reduction of 15% in the specific total cost. Without imposing these typical values, the total cost was further reduced. These results clearly show the potential of model-based optimisation in the reduction of the cost associated with CO2 capture, thus contributing to its effective implementation in power plants.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "c54ac9b0d43f35c0e3f38c7c4ae29d7906a2ce82", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2916006676", "DOI": "10.1016/J.CARBON.2019.02.049", "CorpusId": 139319353}, "title": "Stable and ultrafast lithium storage for LiFePO4/C nanocomposites enabled by instantaneously carbonized acetylenic carbon-rich polymer", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "1db49d620cac1de27c5995f1f008c6c9165caf04", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2513023623", "DOI": "10.1149/ma2012-01/7/375", "CorpusId": 99089494}, "title": "Halogen Flow Battery for Intermittent Renewable Electricity Storage and Carbon Sequestration", "abstract": "The hydrogen-halogen flow battery (HHFB) is being considered for affordable grid-scale and intermittent renewable electricity storage.

It appears that by far the largest contribution to the greenhouse effect stems from emissions of carbon dioxide CO2. A large part of the CO2 emission are produced by the combustion of fossil fuels in conventional power plants and industrial processes. However, the Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technologies have been developed to minimise the CO2 emission to the atmosphere. Three main capture technologies (pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-fuel combustion) have been mainly developed for solid fuels (e.g., coal, biomass) combustion systems. However, there are many gas-fired power plants and industrial process burning natural gas as a cleaner fuel. Natural gas has the lowest CO2 emissions per unit of energy of all fossil fuels at about 14 kg C/GJ, compared to oil with about 20 kg C/GJ and coal with about 25 kg C/GJ. Although gas-fired plants emit less CO2 but still to achieve the environmental goals of the Paris Agreement it is essential to develop CCS technologies for the growing gas-fired systems. Among the available technologies, turbine-based oxy-combustion cycles (Oxyturbine cycles) are one of the most suitable carbon capture technologies for the gas-fired power plants. In this technology, natural gas is burned with pure oxygen, and temperature moderation is done by Flue Gas Recirculation (FGR) so that the exhaust gas includes mainly CO2 and water vapour ready for sequestration and storage. Recent developments in oxy-combustion technology have reduced the cost of capture and made it competitive with post- combustion technology. \n \nSeveral oxyturbine cycles have been introduced by means of thermodynamic analysis. However, only NetPower and Supercritical CES cycles have recently proceeded to the demonstration phase. The NetPower cycle recirculates only carbon dioxide as the working fluid, and the Supercritical CES cycle uses water as its working fluid. The Supercritical CES cycle that has best efficiency among other type of CES cycles includes high, medium and low-pressure turbines (HP, MP, and LP) and the exhaust gas from the high-pressure turbine is reheated and expanded in an MP and LP. Pure oxygen is produced in an Air Separation Unit (ASU) and directly inject into the combustion chamber. The NetPower cycle includes a single turbine with high inlet pressure and a main multi-stream heat exchanger. Pure oxygen is produced in the ASU and mixed with the recycled carbon dioxide, before being introducing to the combustion chamber. Both cycles include recycling loops and carbon dioxide purification sections. These novel cycles reduce the cost for power generation with complete CO2 capture and sequestration with nearly zero emission. \n \nIn this paper, The NetPower and Supercritical CES Cycles are investigated by means of process simulation and the technologies and utilised facilities compared using sensitivity analysis. Both cycles are simulated with Aspen Plus software with the same initial conditions, and the simulation results are compared with IEA 2015 report for validation. The sensitivity of both cycles are analysed with respect to the Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT), Combustion Outlet Pressure (COP) and Heat Exchanger Approach Temperature (HET). The efficiencies are extracted for both the NetPower and CES cycles, and partial load behaviour of the cycles are investigated. The initial results show that the NetPower cycle is more sensitive to the Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT) variations in comparison with S-CES cycle. The results of this paper provide a platform for a comprehensive techno-economical and sensitivity analysis of the NetPower and Supercritical CES Cycles as the leading Oxy-combustion power cycles with full carbon capture.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "bfb430987b6066d1aa02c4ec9a42fa6625a95378", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "8697626", "MAG": "3153116121", "DOI": "10.1039/d1ra00777g", "CorpusId": 234969512, "PubMed": "35423909"}, "title": "A diamino-functionalized silsesquioxane pillared graphene oxide for CO2 capture", "abstract": "In the race for viable solutions that could slow down carbon emissions and help in meeting the climate change targets a lot of effort is being made towards the development of suitable CO2 adsorbents with high surface area, tunable pore size and surface functionalities that could enhance selective adsorption.

Understanding both shortand long-term impacts of harvesting practices (e.g., cutting rotation length, intensity) on forest dynamics is a key factor in developing criteria and guidelines for sustainable forest management practices. Process ecosystem models are useful tools to improve predictive understanding of complex, interacting ecological process and their response to disturbance. Few studies have rigorously tested model simulations against field measurements which would provide more confidence in efforts to quantify logging impacts over the long-term. The biogeochemical model, PnET-BGC has been used to simulate forest biomass, and soil and stream chemistry at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire, USA. Previous versions of PnET-BGC could accurately simulate the longer-term biogeochemical response to harvesting, but were unable to reproduce the marked changes in stream NO3 immediately after clear-cutting which is an important impact of this disturbance regime. Moreover, the dynamics of nutrients to and from major pools, including mineralization and plant uptake, were poorly predicted. The overall goal of this dissertation was to develop a simulation tool to evaluate short and long-term effects of harvesting on the hydrology and biogeochemistry of the northern forest. In the first phase of dissertation, PnET-BGC was modified and tested using field observations from an experimentally whole-tree harvested northern hardwood watershed (W5) at HBEF. In the second phase of dissertation, the parametrized/modified model was applied to other experimentally cut watersheds at the HBEF; including a devegetation experiment (W2; devegetation and herbicide treatment) and a commercial strip-cut (W4) to confirm the ability of the model to depict ecosystem response to a range of harvesting regimes. In the third phase of dissertation, the confirmed model was used as a heuristic tool to investigate long-term changes in aboveground biomass accumulation and nutrient dynamics under three different harvesting intensities (40%, 60%, 80% watershed cutting) for three rotation lengths (30, 60, 90 years) under both constant (current climate) and changing (MIROC5-RCP4.5) future climate through the year 2200. In this dissertation, the model was modified and parametrized allowing for a lower decomposition rate during the earlier years after the clear-cut and increased NH4 + plant uptake with the regrowth of new vegetation to adequately reproduce hydrology, aboveground forest biomass, and soil solution and stream water chemistry in response to a whole-tree harvest of a northern hardwood forest watershed (W5) at the HBEF. Revisions of algorithms of PnET-BGC significantly improved model performance in predicting shortand long-term dynamics of major elements for evaluating effects of various forest cutting strategies at the HBEF. The comparison among cut watersheds showed that around 15 years after the cuts, W5 biomass accumulated at a faster rate than W4 and W2. Despite some initial differences in species composition and biomass accumulation rates among the cut watersheds, simulations of total biomass for all three treated watersheds (W2, W4 and W5) are consistent with the expected growth trajectory of a secondgrowth watershed (W6) at the HBEF. These results suggest that though the different harvesting practices influence initial forest composition and growth, the overall impact on total aboveground biomass is minimal over the long-term at the HBEF. The modified two-soil-layer PnET-BGC was capable of capturing the immediate increase in stream concentrations of NO3 , Ca, Mg and Na as well as enhanced adsorption of SO4 2following the treatments and indicated a greater response for the devegetated W2 and the wholetree harvested W5 than the strip-cut W4. Modeled soil solution Bs horizon and stream water chemistry successfully captured the rapid recovery of leaching nutrients to pre-cut levels after the treatments. Accurate simulation of vegetation regrowth allowed for improved prediction of the chemical response of soil and streamwater to cutting disturbance, indicating the important role of plant uptake in regulating the recovery of the forest ecosystem. Simulations for W2 showed more intense NO3 leaching associated with the herbicide treatment resulting in an accelerated decline in soil base saturation, to values lower than those anticipated from the effects of acid atmospheric deposition alone, and a slower recovery pattern during forest regrowth by the end of the simulation period (2100). A first-order sensitivity analyis showed that simulations by the model to a given level of perturbation of input parameters are more sensitive under mature forest (pre-cut) conditions than for an aggrading forest (post-cut conditions). Simulations of the interactions between forest harvest practices and future climate change for W5 demonstrated the greater sensitivity of forest ecosystem nutrient pools to logging strategies under climate change which included fertilization effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide, relative to constant climate conditions. These effects are accentuated with a shortening of the length of cutting interval and increasing forest harvesting intensity. Simulations of both constant and varying climate conditions considered showed greater sensitivity to varying the length of cutting period than altering cutting intensities. My simulations suggest that tree harvesting under constant current climate should affect living tree biomass and woody debris more than soil carbon, while under climate change, loss of soil organic matter pools may adversely affect site fertility. Depletion of soil base cations is accelerated under climate change due to increases in soil mineralization, coupled with increased plant uptake and enhanced biomass accumulation. Nitrogen is predicted to be the element which experiences the greatest relative loss over both shortand longperiods under different harvesting strategies, particularly with changing climate. Simulations show that all management options under climate change enhance both timber production and overall carbon storage in comparison to stationary climate, but with greater potential for a reduction in long-term soil fertility.

Starting from activity-based gross\u2013net accounting of selected forestry activities to mandatory accounting against a baseline\u2014rules have changed quite rapidly and with significant consequences for accounted credits and debits. Such changes have direct consequences on incentives for climate-investments in forestry. There have also been strong arguments not to include forests into the accounting system by considering large uncertainties, procedural challenges and a fear of unearned credits corrupting the overall accounting system, among others. This paper reflects the development of respective accounting approaches and reviews the progress made on core challenges and resulting incentives.Main textThe historic development of forest management accounting rules is analysed in the light of the Paris Agreement. Pros and cons of different approaches are discussed with specific focus on the challenge to maintain integrity of the accounting approach and on resulting incentives for additional human induced investments to increase growth for future substitution and increased C storage by forest management. The review is solely based on scientific publications and official IPCC and UNFCC documents. Some rather political statements of non-scientific stakeholders are considered to reflect criticism. Such sources are indicated accordingly. Remaining and emerging requirements for an accounting system for post 2030 are highlighted.ConclusionsThe Paris Agreement is interpreted as a \u201cgame changer\u201d for the role of forests in climate change mitigation. Many countries rely on forests in their NDCs to achieve their self-set targets. In fact, the agreement \u201cto achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century\u201d puts pressure on the entire land sector to contribute to overall GHG emission reductions. This also concerns forests as a resource for the bio-based economy and wood products, and for increasing carbon reservoirs. By discussing the existing elements of forest accounting rules and conditions for establishing an accounting system post 2030, it is concluded that core requirements like factoring out direct human-induced from indirect human-induced and natural impacts on managed lands, a facilitation of incentives for management changes and providing safeguards for the integrity of the accounting system are not sufficiently secured by currently discussed accounting rules. A responsibility to fulfil these basic requirements is transferred to Nationally Determined Contributions. Increased incentives for additional human induced investments are not stipulated by the accounting approach but rather by the political decision to make use of the substitution effect and potential net removals from LULUCF to contribute to self-set targets.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "5c845b31b231625d2be02127921e429c11b4159c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2108925820", "DOI": "10.1002/bit.25619", "CorpusId": 25609017, "PubMed": "25899427"}, "title": "Challenges and opportunities for microalgae\u2010mediated CO2 capture and biorefinery", "abstract": "Aquacultures of microalgae are frontrunners for photosynthetic capture of CO2 from flue gases. Expedient implementation mandates coupling of microalgal CO2 capture with synthesis of fuels and organic products, so as to derive value from biomass. An integrated biorefinery complex houses a biomass growth and harvesting area and a refining zone for conversion to product(s) and separation to desired purity levels. As growth and downstream options require energy and incur loss of carbon, put together, the loop must be energy positive, carbon negative, or add substantial value. Feasibility studies can, thus, aid the choice from among the rapidly evolving technological options, many of which are still in the early phases of development. We summarize basic engineering calculations for the key steps of a biorefining loop where flue gases from a thermal power station are captured using microalgal biomass along with subsequent options for conversion to fuel or value added products. An assimilation of findings from recent laboratory and pilot\u2010scale experiments and life cycle analysis (LCA) studies is presented as carbon and energy yields for growth and harvesting of microalgal biomass and downstream options.

Electrochemistry, the combination of electrical and chemical phenomena, is at the heart of this and involves all chemical phenomena that concern charge transfer and charge separation, thus being intimately involved in many biological reactions and aspects of our everyday life, and in the making of many products that we use. However, the general public would say that they are unaware of most of this until we remind them of examples such as the batteries powering their cellular phone or laptop computers, or the glucose biosensors widely used by diabetics. Electrochemistry played a crucial role in the many scientific achievements of the nineteenth century, and in particular the discovery of the periodic system of elements. The scope of electrochemistry applications ranges from industrial electrolysis processes, coatings that are usually to protect against corrosion, solar energy conversion and energy storage, conducting polymers, electrochemical sensors and biosensors, and bioelectrochemistry. The conducting strand in the above is materials: new materials, or already-knownmaterials but structured in a different way, or produced in different media such as ionic liquids or deep eutectic solvents. We now have tools available that are enabling us to control the nanostructure of electrodes, the shape of nanomaterials and the positioning of nanomaterials on electrode surfaces that all influence electrocatalysis. Exploiting this is probably the most important underlying task of electrochemistry in the future. Electrochemistry has an important part to play in addressing the challenges of climate change, the environment and sustainable development and health that need the contributions from all branches of chemistry and other sciences. Electrochemical energy is a clean energy at the point of use: the energy of the electrons can be measured as well as controlled to introduce greater selectivity and yield. One of our challenges is therefore to make the source of electrons clean. This is being achieved and will continue through renewable energies such as wind energy and, more importantly, solar energy conversion, particularly photovoltaic cells. There is no doubt that this area will grow and power sources will become more efficient, which means new materials that enable higher energy densities. Linked to this are effective new methods for energy storage. A tremendous amount of effort is being devoted to developing energy storage such as with redox flow batteries and supercapacitors. We foresee research into batteries based on sodium and aluminium coming to fruition, since, even after improvements with higher energy densities and lower current losses and recycling, the supply of lithium is unlikely to be sufficient to satisfy world demand. The advantage of fuel cells that can be switched on and off is currently offset by the safety needs of fuel storage; this needs to be solved or alternative more stable fuels that do not contaminate the atmosphere must be found. New technologies for important industrial processes can benefit from electrochemistry, using renewable energy sources. One of these is electrochemically assisted ammonia synthesis that will reduce the total energy consumption and another is carbon dioxide reduction, not only capturing the carbon dioxide produced in industrial processes but, at the same time, producing molecules such as methanol that are highly useful precursors in organic synthesis. Electrochemistry is everywhere in life and electron transfer reactions in biological systems are of the utmost importance. Electron and proton transport occur in nerve excitation, blood coagulation, vision, smell, photosynthesis, hormones, proteins, peptides, etc. Electrochemical methods can provide insight into the redox mechanisms of fundamental biological processes.

Switching to renewable resources and CO2 capture and storage in power plants, are regarded as promising alternatives. Post-, oxyand pre-combustion CO2 capture concepts are applicable for power plants using natural gas, coal or biomass as a feedstock. A systematic thermo-environomic optimisation strategy including thermodynamic, economic and environmental considerations is applied for the consistent modelling and optimisation of CO2 capture options. The environmental benefit and the energetic and economic costs of CO2 capture are assessed and optimised. The economic competitiveness appears to be strongly determined by the economic conditions such as the resource price and the carbon tax which are highly uncertain. A method that takes into account the economic parameter sensitivity to support decision-making based on the Pareto-optimal solutions is proposed here. The selection method aims at identifying the most economically competitive process configuration in terms of the polygeneration of electricity, heat and captured CO2 in a wide range of market conditions.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "48c662527d3a7a7ea491d531472dc63a1ae76efb", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 115139820}, "title": "The role of biomass for energy and materials for GHG mitigation from a global and European perspective", "abstract": "Biomass is seen as one of the key renewable energy options to displace fossil fuels and contribute to mitigation of GHG emissions on a large scale (Woods et al., 2015). Many scenario\u2019s that describe how a low carbon future in 2050 can be achieved, project substantial shares of biomass in the future global energy supply, ranging between 10% to over a third, adding up to a contribution of 300 EJ (7200 Mtoe) in many scenarios in the second half of this century [IPCC, 2014] versus a projected total global energy use between 800 EJ (19200 Mtoe) to over 1500 EJ (35900 Mtoe). Among the reasons why biomass is so important in many mitigation scenarios is its versatility. It can deliver dispatchable power, high temperature heat, liquid and gaseous (transportation) fuels and renewable feedstock for material (chemicals, construction materials). Furthermore, many biomass conversion pathways are commercially attractive today (e.g. combined heat and power generation from biomass, organic waste conversion to e.g. biogas, ethanol production from sugar beet, etc, while biorefinery concepts and further advancements in value chains can make advanced biofuels (e.g produced from lignocellulosic material) and platform chemical in a competitive range in the medium term. Another key point is that state-of-the-art mitigation scenarios point out that Bioenergy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) can and should deliver negative emissions (carbon taken up during plant growth is released as CO2 during conversion and subsequently captured for geological storage) which is required to meet the 1.5\u00b0C GMT target agreed in Paris. Negative emission on the desired scale can only be achieved by using (sustainable) biomass.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "22968a33f8c6e19d3bb99561275791646bcc2d8f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1594305928", "DOI": "10.2172/860323", "CorpusId": 108731184}, "title": "NOVEL CONCEPTS RESEARCH IN GEOLOGIC STORAGE OF CO2 PHASE III", "abstract": "As part of the Department of Energy's (DOE) initiative on developing new technologies for storage of carbon dioxide in geologic reservoirs, Battelle has been investigating the feasibility of CO{sub 2} sequestration in the deep saline reservoirs in the Ohio River Valley region.

The main objective of the project is to demonstrate that CO{sub 2} sequestration in deep formations is feasible from engineering and economic perspectives, as well as being an inherently safe practice and one that will be acceptable to the public. In addition, the project is designed to evaluate the geology of deep formations in the Ohio River Valley region in general and in the vicinity of AEP's Mountaineer Power Plant in particular, in order to determine their potential use for conducting a long-term test of CO{sub 2} disposal in deep saline formations.

As discussed in the following report, the main accomplishments were analysis of Copper Ridge ''B-zone'' reservoir test resultsmore\u00a0\u00bb from the AEP No.1 well and design and feasibility support tasks. Reservoir test results indicate injection potential in the Copper Ridge ''B-zone'' may be significantly higher than anticipated for the Mountaineer site.

Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is regarded as a possible negative emission technology. This thesis aims to study the technological and economic feasibility of implementing BECCS in the cement industry. Four different types of biomass - rice husk pellets, wood pellets, sewage sludge, and municipal solid waste were chosen to substitute 30% of the coal in a model of a European cement plant. With an emphasis on retrofitting, three CO 2 capture technologies, absorption using monoethanol amine (MEA), calcium looping (CaL) based capture, and oxyfuel combustion capture were chosen. This thesis compares the techno-economic performance of the BECCS technologies in a cement plant using the key performance indicators (KPIs) of specific primary energy consumption per CO 2 avoided (SPECCA), cement production costs and costs of CO 2 avoided. Mass balance results and estimates of capital and operating expenses were used to calculate the KPIs. The parameters for each biomass-CO 2 capture combination are compared to each other and compared to the reference value of a cement plant which uses 100% coal without CCS. The results were subjected to sensitivity analysis. CO 2 accounting was performed for a defined boundary to estimate the carbon footprint of the BECCS technologies. The BECCS technologies studied have a lower rate of cement production as a result of co-firing biomass in existing boilers. This can be attributed to the low calorific value of biomass. Of the three CO 2 capture technologies, oxyfuel combustion capture is the least energy consuming option (1.8 MJ/t CO2 , with wood pellets) and the highest range of SPECCA is visible in the case of MEA (8.6 MJ/t CO2 , with municipal solid waste). The cement production costs increase by 42 to 89% compared to the costs without CO 2 capture. The cost of CO 2 avoided is between 45 \u20ac/t CO2 (wood pellets with oxyfuel) to a higher range of 96 \u20ac/t CO2 (sewage sludge with MEA). The variation in costs is significantly affected by the type of biomass used. CaL technology has a moderate performance in energy consumption and costs. SPECCA obtained for CaL process is in the range of 4.1 to 4.4 MJ/t CO2 and the cost of CO 2 avoided is in the range of 57 to 74 \u20ac/t CO2 . CaL also entails the highest CO 2 capture rates, in comparison with MEA and oxyfuel technologies. In terms of total CO 2 emissions avoided, CaL based CO 2 capture gives the highest CO 2 avoided for the system boundary defined. Therefore, when the CO 2 removed from the atmosphere through the growth of biomass is included, the net CO 2 emissions are the least for CaL capture technology. The reason is the additional thermal energy requirements for the retrofitted CaL process units, which are met with 100% biomass. Although theoretically, a net negative value of CO 2 emissions was visible in the case of CaL, it must be noted that upstream process emissions are not included. But in practice, it is still unclear as to whether negative emissions are attainable with the information at hand.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "e5f22d64e18d86c6e1d826b609d52013cb63ad54", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3023139060", "CorpusId": 233097483}, "title": "Geologic Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage via Low-Temperature Carbonation of Peridotite", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "26e740618b6598b2d41d765fb4f1074f3f27e9ae", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1002/advs.202105603", "CorpusId": 247977852, "PubMed": "35384377"}, "title": "Ordered Mesoporous Boron Carbon Nitrides with Tunable Mesopore Nanoarchitectonics for Energy Storage and CO2 Adsorption Properties.", "abstract": "Porous boron carbon nitride (BCN) is one of the exciting systems with unique electrochemical and adsorption properties.

Herein, the preparation of well-defined mesoporous boron carbon nitride (MBCN) with high specific surface area, tunable pores, and nitrogen contents is demonstrated through a simple integration of chemical polymerization of readily available sucrose and borane ammonia complex (BAC) through the nano-hard-templating approach. The bimodal pores are introduced in MBCN by controlling the self-organization of BAC and sucrose molecules within the nanochannels of the template.

Furthermore, the overshoot in the mid-century prior to a full realization of negative emissions would give rise to a risk because such a temporal but excessive warming above 2\u00b0C might amplify itself by strengthening climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, which are known to be positive albeit with large uncertainties (Friedlingstein et al. 2006).

The total abatement costs are estimated from the Marginal Abatement Cost functions for CO2, CH4, N2O, and BC, which are derived from Azar (2013). Our preliminary results show that, if carbon cycle feedbacks turn out to be stronger than what is known today, it would incur substantial abatement costs to keep up with the 2\u00b0C stabilization goal. Our results also suggest that it would be less expensive in the long run to plan for a 2\u00b0C stabilization pathway by considering strong carbon cycle feedbacks because it would cost more if we correct the emission pathway in the mid-century to adjust for unexpectedly large carbon cycle feedbacks during overshoot.

Negative emission technologies \u2013if deployable at a sufficiently large scale during the second half of this century \u2013would make the 2\u00b0C target more feasible in the midst of the slow political progress. However, such technologies are currently at their infancy and their future penetrations may fall short of the scale required to stabilize the warming (Scott et al. 2013). Furthermore, the overshoot in the mid-century prior to a full realization of negative emissions would give rise to a risk because such a temporal but excessive warming above 2\u00b0C might amplify itself by strengthening climate-carbon cycle feedbacks, which are known to be positive albeit with large uncertainties (Friedlingstein et al. 2006). When one considers other classes of carbon cycle feedbacks including those with permafrost thawing and wildfire, such a risk could be even higher. It has not been extensively assessed yet how carbon cycle feedbacks might play out during the overshoot in the context of negative emissions, while the literature on carbon cycle feedbacks has burgeoned in recent years. This study explores how 2\u00b0C stabilization pathways, in particular those which undergo overshoot, can be influenced by carbon cycle feedbacks and asks their climatic and economic consequences. We compute 2\u00b0C stabilization emissions scenarios under a cost-effectiveness principle, in which the total abatement costs are minimized such that the global warming is capped at 2\u00b0C. We employ a reduced-complexity model, the Aggregated Carbon Cycle, Atmospheric Chemistry, and Climate model (ACC2) (Tanaka et al., 2013), which comprises a box model of the global carbon cycle, simple parameterizations of the atmospheric chemistry, and a land-ocean energy balance model. The total abatement costs are estimated from the Marginal Abatement Cost functions for CO2, CH4, N2O, and BC, which are derived from Azar (2013). Our preliminary results show that, if carbon cycle feedbacks turn out to be stronger than what is known today, it would incur substantial abatement costs to keep up with the 2\u00b0C stabilization goal. Our results also suggest that it would be less expensive in the long run to plan for a 2\u00b0C stabilization pathway by considering strong carbon cycle feedbacks because it would cost more if we correct the emission pathway in the mid-century to adjust for unexpectedly large carbon cycle feedbacks during overshoot. Furthermore, our tentative results point to a key policy message: do not rely on negative emissions to achieve the 2\u00b0C target. It would make more sense to gear climate mitigation actions toward the stabilization target without betting on negative emissions because negative emissions might create large overshoot in case of strong feedbacks. Our simple approach illuminates a need for investigating this issue further by using a range of models including coupled Earth System Model (ESM)-Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs).

In depleted reservoirs, full or near-miscibility of injected CO2 with oil is difficult to achieve, and immiscible CO2 injection leaves a large volume of oil behind and limits available pore volume (PV) for storing CO2. In this paper, we present an experimental study to delineate the effect of ethanol-treated CO2 injection on oil recovery, net CO2 stored, and amount of ethanol left in the reservoir.\n We inject CO2 and ethanol-treated CO2 into Bentheimer Sandstone cores representing reservoirs. The oil phase consists of a mixture of 0.65 hexane and 0.35 decane (C6-C10 mixture) by molar fraction in one set of experimental runs, and pure decane (C10) in the other set of experimental runs. All experimental runs are conducted at constant temperature 70\u00b0C and various pressures to exhibit immiscibility (9.0\u2009MPa for the C6-C10 mixture and 9.6\u2009MPa for pure C10) or near-miscibility (11.7\u2009MPa for the C6-C10 mixture and 12.1\u2009MPa for pure C10). Pressure differences across the core, oil recovery, and compositions and rates of the produced fluids are recorded during the experimental runs. Ultimate oil recovery under immiscibility is found to be 9 to 15% greater using ethanol-treated CO2 injection than that using pure CO2 injection. Net CO2 stored for pure C10 under immiscibility is found to be 0.134 PV greater during ethanol-treated CO2 injection than during pure CO2 injection. For the C6-C10 mixture under immiscibility, both ethanol-treated CO2 injection and CO2 injection yield the same net CO2 stored. However, for the C6-C10 mixture under near-miscibility,ethanol-treated CO2 injection is found to yield 0.161 PV less net CO2 stored than does pure CO2 injection. These results suggest potential improvement in oil recovery and net CO2 stored using ethanol-treated CO2 injection instead of pure CO2 injection. If economically viable, ethanol-treated CO2 injection could be used as a carbon capture, usage, and storage method in low-pressure reservoirs, for which pure CO2 injection would be infeasible.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "52071e6f45aea43c7601380f56b55a3af7af9986", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3162064997", "DOI": "10.2139/SSRN.3822009", "CorpusId": 236677291}, "title": "Preliminaries Study of Pilot Project Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage in An East Java Oil and Gas Field", "abstract": "A preliminary study for Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) pilot project in an East Java oil and gas field Indonesia has been conducted. CCUS projects have dual purposes: providing a means for increasing production in declined oil fields and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas sector by injecting the separated CO2 into the declined oil and gas reservoir. CCUS will be attractive in Indonesia since it could offer additional income for the country from the incremental oil and gas productions and the implementation could use the existing regulations that valid for oil and gas sector. The study of a CCUS pilot project plan has been conducted in order to make sure that the reservoir is suitable for CO2 EOR storage. The CCUS pilot project plan is situated in an oil onshore field in East Java province, Indonesia, which was discovered in 2001. It is situated in the Tuban block, and has nearly 308 million STB of oil in place and more than 100 million barrels of oil in cumulative production. \n \nThe chosen oil field for has been in production decline for several years and yet the efforts to increase recovery, such as water injection, have been ongoing. Suitability for a CO2-EOR operation is dependent on the petrophysical properties of the reservoir, such as porosity, permeability, and fluid saturation, as well as in-situ reservoir fluid properties such as oil density and viscosity. Reservoir depth is also a key parameter in making a decision as it will impact the miscibility and interaction between CO2 and oil phases. This CO2 EOR pilot project consists of a total of five wells \u2013 four production wells at the four corners of a square with an injection well in the middle. The preliminary design for a pilot scale is based on the available CO2 from the field itself, which currently produces 4.4 million SCF (240 tones) of CO2 per day. This pilot-scale test is aimed at examining the performance and viability of a gravity stable CO2 flood. The proposed CO2 injection volumes at the pilot scale are 5 million SCFD respectively, which are estimated to correspond to a production increase of 400 BOPD. For a gravity (gas cap) drive EOR system, the gas (in this case CO2) will be injected into the gas cap above the producing zone. This will help in driving the oil down to the production zones and into the production wells. \n \nWhen injecting into the gas cap, the wellbore integrity in the gas zone and just above the gas zone in the sealing layer must be evaluated. This is to ensure that the CO2 does not escape up the wellbore outside the casing and enter a higher layer. It is essential to include well integrity in the baseline monitoring program to evaluate periodic changes in the well integrity with injection. Monitoring is crucial for the success of a subsurface CO2 injection operation. CO2 injection monitoring is used to verify and compare the injection behaviour with reservoir simulation predictions as well as monitor for potential CO2 leakage through faults or wellbore and avoid any CO2 migration to and accumulation at the surface.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "79fef202634c35c48ab19147d49b3d75a064b31a", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s42452-022-04991-4", "CorpusId": 247529078}, "title": "Next generation of polyolefin plastics: improving sustainability with existing and novel feedstock base", "abstract": "\n \n In this account, we present an overview of existing and emerging olefin production technologies, comparing them from the standpoint of carbon intensity, efficiency, feedstock type and availability.

How to reduce CO2 footprint to stop or slow down the global warming has been hot topic. As a developing country, China has become the largest CO2 emission nation in the world during the industrialization process to develop economy, although the CO2 emission intensity has been reduced significantly compared to previous stage. China has promised and succeeded to keep the promise reduce carbon intensity to meet the requirement of Paris Agreement. To meet the promise to attain carbon peak emission in 2030 and carbon neutrality in 2060 (CPCN), carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is an important and necessary step. Considering the high cost, high energy intensity and complex technology integrated optimization add uncertainties of CCS, utilization of captured CO2 can be of vital importance. One of the most attractive CCUS in China is CO2 enhanced oil recovery with captured CO2 (CCS EOR). CO2 EOR with captured CO2 may be one the best CCUS ways for China for the following three reasons. First, it can meet the increasing oil demand while reducing the carbon intensive coal. Second, around 66 CO2 EOR field tests have been conducted in China and experiences have ben gained. Finally, CO2 EOR in the USA was a proven technology which can increase oil production significantly and stably. Latest CCUS technology progress in China was reviewed. As of July 2021, 49 projects were carried out or under construction. Net CO2 avoided costs from 39 projects varied from 120 to 730 CNY/ ton CO2 (18.5-112.3 USD/ ton CO2). Although CCUS technology development in China was significant, the gap between global leading levels are obvious. Current challenges of CCS EOR include high CO2 capture cost, small scale, low incremental oil recovery, long-time huge capital input. The costs can be significantly reduced when the scale was enlarged to a commercial scale and transportation costs were further reduced by either pipelines or trains. CO2 transportation with well-distributed high-speed rail in China may be a feasible choice in future. If the CO2 EOR in China develops with the same speed as the USA, CO2 used for EOR in 2050 can be as high as 87.27 million tons. CO2 used for CO2 EOR in 2050 can account for 17% to 44% of the CO2 emission.
