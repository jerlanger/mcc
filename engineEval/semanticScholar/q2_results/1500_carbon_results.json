A key parameter in reservoir simulation is relative permeability. However, mineral precipitation alters the pore structure over time, and leads correspondingly to permeability changing with time. In this study, we numerically investigate the influence of carbonate precipitation on relative permeability during CO_{2} storage. The pore spaces in rock samples were extracted by high-resolution microcomputed tomography (CT) scanned images. The fluid velocity field within the three-dimensional pore spaces was calculated by the lattice Boltzmann method, while reactive transport with calcite deposition was modeled by an advection-reaction formulation solved by the finite volume method. To increase the computational efficiency and reduce the processing time, we adopted a graphics processing unit parallel computing technique. The relative permeability of the sample rock was then calculated by a highly optimized two-phase lattice Boltzmann model. We also proposed two pore clogging models. In the first model, the clogging processes are modeled by transforming fluid nodes to solid nodes based on their precipitated mass level. In the second model, the porosity is artificially reduced by adjusting the gray scale threshold of the CT images. The developed method accurately simulates the mineralization process observed in laboratory experiment. Precipitation-induced evolution of pore structure significantly influenced the absolute permeability. The relative permeability, however, was much more influenced by pore reduction in the nonwetting phase than in the wetting phase. The output of the structural changes in pore geometry by this model could be input to CO_{2} reservoir simulators to investigate the outcome of sequestered CO_{2}.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "088072cfa251e3707186247cde9ee2317e4fad66", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3035740209", "DOI": "10.1111/gcb.15219", "CorpusId": 219620118, "PubMed": "32531815"}, "title": "The impact of interventions in the global land and agri\u2010food sectors on Nature\u2019s Contributions to People and the UN Sustainable Development Goals", "abstract": "Interlocked challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, and land degradation require transformative interventions in the land management and food production sectors to reduce carbon emissions, strengthen adaptive capacity, and increase food security.

The amount of carbon captured per unit area is increasing and the area available to blue carbon is also increasing. Carbon sequestration could further increase under moderate (+1\u00b0C) ocean warming, contrary to decreasing global blue carbon stocks elsewhere. For example, in warmer waters, mangroves and seagrasses are in decline and benthic organisms are close to their physiological limits, so a 1\u00b0C increase in water temperature could push them above their thermal tolerance (e.g. bleaching of coral reefs).

One option, Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), is prominent in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), with projected annual contributions of 8\u201316.5 GtCO2 per year of atmospheric carbon dioxide removal whilst contributing 150\u2013300 EJ per year, or 14 to 20% of global primary energy supply, in 2100. Implicit in these scenarios is the assumption that BECCS is a net producer of energy. However, relatively energy intensive biomass supply chains and low power generation efficiency could challenge this ubiquitous assumption. Deploying an energy negative technology at this scale could thus represent a threat to energy security. In this contribution, we evaluate the energy return on investment (EROI) of an archetypal BECCS facility. In order to highlight the importance of biomass sourcing, two feedstock scenarios are considered: use of domestic biomass pellets (UK) and import of biomass pellets from Louisiana, USA. We use the Modelling and Optimisation of Negative Emissions Technologies (MONET) framework to explicitly account for growing, pre-treating, transporting and converting the feedstock in a 500 MW BECCS facility. As an example, we illustrate how the net electricity balance (NElB) of a UK-based BECCS facility can be either positive or negative, as a function of supply chain decisions. Power plant efficiency, fuel efficiency for transport, transport distance, moisture content, drying method, as well as yield were identified as key factors that need to be carefully managed to maximise BECCS net electricity balance. A key insight of this contribution is that, given an annual carbon removal target, increasing BECCS' power generation efficiency by using a more advanced biomass conversion and CO2 capture technology could improve BECCS net electricity balance, but at the cost of increasing the amount of BECCS capacity required to meet this target. BECCS optimal deployment pathway is thus heavily dependent on which service provided by BECCS is most valued: carbon dioxide removal or power generation.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "e4f73dfb30ef27962a906b4a28d1d9ef8d52e982", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2007375286", "DOI": "10.1002/ep.11832", "CorpusId": 109702193}, "title": "Economic analysis for the transport and storage of captured carbon dioxide in South Korea", "abstract": "The continuous rise of CO2 emissions is a major cause of global climate change. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is widely seen as a practical technology for reducing CO2 emissions. CCS mainly consists of capturing CO2 from large emitting sources and its transportation to a sequestration site where it can be stored safely for a long period of time. The average CO2 emission growth rate of Korea is 1.0% which is the second highest among the Organization for Economic Co\u2010operation and Development (OECD) countries. It becomes even more challenging when CO2 is transported to an offshore storage since there is little experience with subsea pipelines for CO2 transportation. In this study, a plausible transport and storage model scheme has been developed and then employed to study different offshore CO2 transportation cases for South Korea as: CO2 transport in liquid phase (Temperature= \u221220\u00b0C, Pressure= 6.50 MPa); CO2 transport in liquid phase (Temperature= 5\u00b0C, Pressure= 9.30 MPa); CO2 transport in supercritical phase (Temperature= 40\u00b0C, Pressure= 15.00 MPa). CO2 storage capacity in sedimentary basins of Korea is evaluated between 19 and 27.2 Gt (giga\u2010ton) of CO2. Finally, this paper explores the costs associated with transport and geologic sequestration of CO2. Transport cost varies from 10.9 to 15.5 US$/tCO2 while the storage cost ranges from 20.8 to 21.3 US$/tCO2 depending on the specific scenario and depth at which CO2 is stored. Sensitivity analysis showed a decrease in storage cost of 62.4% and 93.6% in 2030 and 2050 respectively for projected CO2 volumes in Korea. \u00a9 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 33: 978\u2013992, 2014", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "a596bfd525c57a863a6b983c0570a7b1a59b36fa", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2115811186", "DOI": "10.4236/IJCCE.2012.12002", "CorpusId": 110617308}, "title": "The SECARB Anthropogenic Test: A US Integrated CO2 Capture, Transportation and Storage Test", "abstract": "The United States Department of Energy (DOE) seeks to validate the feasibility of injecting, storing and monitoring CO2 in the subsurface (geologic storage) as an approach to mitigate atmospheric emissions of CO2.

The capture component of the test takes place at the James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant (Plant Barry) in Bucks, Alabama. The capture facility, equivalent to 25 MW, will utilize post-combustion amine capture technology licensed from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America. CO2 captured at the plant will be transported by pipeline for underground storage in a deep, saline geologic formation within the Citronelle Dome located in Citronelle, Alabama. At the end of the first quarter of 2012, up to 550 tonnes of CO2 per day will be captured and transported twelve miles by pipeline to the storage site for injection and subsurface storage. The injection target is the lower Cretaceous Paluxy Formation which occurs at 9400 feet. Trans- portation and injection operations will continue for one to two years. Subsurface monitoring will be deployed through 2017 to track plume movement and monitor for leakage.

Nine electric power sources and two liquid fuel options are considered. The electricity sources include solar-photovoltaics (PV), concentrated solar power (CSP), wind, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave, tidal, nuclear, and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. The liquid fuel options include corn-ethanol (E85) and cellulosic-E85. To place the electric and liquid fuel sources on an equal footing, we examine their comparative abilities to address the problems mentioned by powering new-technology vehicles, including battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (HFCVs), and flex-fuel vehicles run on E85. Twelve combinations of energy source-vehicle type are considered. Upon ranking and weighting each combination with respect to each of 11 impact categories, four clear divisions of ranking, or tiers, emerge. Tier 1 (highest-ranked) includes wind-BEVs and wind-HFCVs. Tier 2 includes CSP-BEVs, geothermal-BEVs, PV-BEVs, tidal-BEVs, and wave-BEVs. Tier 3 includes hydro-BEVs, nuclear-BEVs, and CCS-BEVs. Tier 4 includes corn- and cellulosic-E85. Wind-BEVs ranked first in seven out of 11 categories, including the two most important, mortality and climate damage reduction. Although HFCVs are much less efficient than BEVs, wind-HFCVs are still very clean and were ranked second among all combinations. Tier 2 options provide significant benefits and are recommended. Tier 3 options are less desirable. However, hydroelectricity, which was ranked ahead of coal-CCS and nuclear with respect to climate and health, is an excellent load balancer, thus recommended. The Tier 4 combinations (cellulosic- and corn-E85) were ranked lowest overall and with respect to climate, air pollution, land use, wildlife damage, and chemical waste. Cellulosic-E85 ranked lower than corn-E85 overall, primarily due to its potentially larger land footprint based on new data and its higher upstream air pollution emissions than corn-E85. Whereas cellulosic-E85 may cause the greatest average human mortality, nuclear-BEVs cause the greatest upper-limit mortality risk due to the expansion of plutonium separation and uranium enrichment in nuclear energy facilities worldwide. Wind-BEVs and CSP-BEVs cause the least mortality. The footprint area of wind-BEVs is 2\u20136 orders of magnitude less than that of any other option. Because of their low footprint and pollution, wind-BEVs cause the least wildlife loss. The largest consumer of water is corn-E85. The smallest are wind-, tidal-, and wave-BEVs. The US could theoretically replace all 2007 onroad vehicles with BEVs powered by 73\u2006000\u2013144\u2006000 5 MW wind turbines, less than the 300\u2006000 airplanes the US produced during World War II, reducing US CO2 by 32.5\u201332.7% and nearly eliminating 15\u2006000/yr vehicle-related air pollution deaths in 2020. In sum, use of wind, CSP, geothermal, tidal, PV, wave, and hydro to provide electricity for BEVs and HFCVs and, by extension, electricity for the residential, industrial, and commercial sectors, will result in the most benefit among the options considered. The combination of these technologies should be advanced as a solution to global warming, air pollution, and energy security.

By investigating the challenges of the country\u2019s drive toward environmental sustainability, the present study offers a new perspective on the role of electricity consumption and economic growth in a carbon-income function setting. This study also incorporates globalization into CO 2 emissions equation for the experimental period of 1970\u20132014. Stationarity properties were ascertained by the Zivot and Andrew unit root test under a single structural break. Subsequently, the recent and novel combined cointegration test of Bayer and Hanck ( 2013 ) in conjunction with the Pesaran bounds testing approach is used to establish a cointegration relationship among the selected variables. Finally, the modified Wald test of the Toda-Yamamoto Granger causality test is employed to detect the direction of causality flows among the variables. Empirical piece of evidence finds a statistically positive correlation between electricity consumption and economic growth as seen in the long-run regression. This result is also affirmed by the Granger causality test. The test corroborates with the electricity-induced growth hypothesis in the case of China. However, there is an environmental trade-off, as more electricity consumptions spur increased carbon dioxide emissions (CO 2 ). Our study finds empirical support that globalization reduced pollutant emissions in both the short and long run over our sampled period. Based on these results and outcomes, several policy prescriptions on the energy-income and environment nexus are renders for policymakers.

Increasing energy efficiency and a transition to renewable energy as the major energy source can reduce CO 2 emissions, but such measures can only lead to significant emission reductions in the long-term. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a promising technological option for reducing CO 2 emissions on a shorter time scale.

Globally, 240 billion tonnes CO 2 can be captured by 2050. The calculations indicate that wide implementation of CCS can reduce CO 2 emissions by 56 % in the EU and 37 % globally in 2050 compared to emission levels today.

Long-term losses of soil organic carbon (SOC) have been observed in many agriculture lands in Northwest China, one of the regions with the longest cultivation history in the world. The decline of SOC contents not only impaired the soil fertility but also increased the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted from terrestrial ecosystems into the atmosphere. However, quantifying the SOC losses at regional scale has long been remaining unsolved. A process-based model, Denitrification-Decomposition or DNDC, was adopted in the study to quantify impacts of farming management practices on SOC dynamics for a selected region, Shaanxi Province. The selected domain, with 3 million hectares of cropland across different climatic and farming management regimes, is representative for the major agricultural areas in Northwest China. The DNDC model was tested against long-term SOC dynamics observed at five agricultural sites in China. The agreement between the observed and modeled results indicate that DNDC was capable of capturing patterns and magnitudes of SOC changes across the climate zones, soil types, and management regimes in China. To quantify SOC dynamics for Shaanxi, we constructed a GIS database to hold all of the DNDC-required input information (e.g., weather, soil properties, crop acreage, and farming practices) for all the farmland in the studied domain. Sensitivity tests indicated the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties, especially initial SOC content, was the major source of uncertainty for the modeled SOC dynamics at regional scale. The Most Sensitive Factor (MSF) method was employed in the study to quantify the uncertainties produced from the upscaling process. The results from the regional simulations for Shaanxi indicated that (1) the overall 3 million hectares of farmland in the province was a source of atmospheric CO2 with 0.5 Tg C yr\u22121 lost in 2000 under the current farming management conditions, (2) an increase in the rate of crop residue incorporation from 15% to 50% or 90% converted the farmland from the C source to a C sink with 0.7 or 2.1 Tg C yr\u22121 sequestered, respectively, and (3) applying farmyard manure at a rate of 500 kg C ha\u22121 also converted the cropland into a weak C sink with 0.2 Tg C sequestered in the farmland in Shaanxi. In the studied domain, crop residue and farmyard manure used to be the major sources of soil nutrients during the centuries-long cultivation history but were gradually abandoned since 1950s when synthetic fertilizers became available. The results from this modeling study suggest that recovery of the traditional farming practices (i.e., residue incorporation and manure amendment) be a feasible approach to substantially improve the soil C status in the farmland of Shaanxi. The values of C gain or loss from this study for Shaanxi could vary if the modeled domain shifts to other provinces in Northwest China although the general conclusion may remain.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "77ce036c50bfddc2a2edbf77e8ebfb84479fa98f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2328577565", "DOI": "10.1039/C5ME00013K", "CorpusId": 112244752}, "title": "A systematic approach to design task-specific ionic liquids and their optimal operating conditions", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has gained great interest in recent years as a potential technology to mitigate industrial carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Ionic liquids (ILs) were identified as potential CO2 capturing solvents, due to their negligible vapour pressure, high thermal stability, and wide range of thermophysical properties. However, determining a task-specific IL merely through experimental studies is tedious and costly, as there are about a million possible combinations of cations and anions that may make up the ILs. This work presents a systematic approach to design an optimal IL for the purpose of carbon capture. The significant contribution of the presented approach in this work is the introduction of disjunctive programming to identify optimal operating conditions of the process involved while solving the IL synthesis problem. As studies show, the performance of ILs changes with the operating conditions, which in turn affects overall performance of the carbon capture process. Hence, the presented approach will determine the optimal IL by considering the effect of system operating conditions, and simultaneously determining optimal conditions of the carbon capture process. Operating conditions of the process are modelled as continuous variables; disjunctive programming can discretise these variables and reduce search space for results. Since most of the ILs to be designed are novel solvents, their thermophysical properties are estimated using the group contribution (GC) method.

While there have been encouraging signs that CCS is gaining acceptance as a means to reduce carbon emissions, the overall outlook looks somewhat mixed. Recent developments in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), Germany, India, and China are discussed to obtain an indication of how likely it is that CCS technologies will gain acceptance in each respective country. Fossil fuels continue to be a versatile means of energy storage, especially compared with many low-emissions alternatives. This is noted because, apart from reduced fuel consumption, CCS technology is key to reducing Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced by the use of fossil fuels in transportation. Primary focus in this review was placed on post-combustion-capture technologies because these mechanisms are most easily adapted for use with the existing fleet of internal combustion engines. Three post-combustion-capture mechanisms were described: absorption, membrane separation, and adsorption. Considerations about the consumer\u2019s operational costs were discussed, including storage management of captured CO2, additional energy costs to support separation and storage, discharge procedures, and vehicle maintenance costs. Models of consumer inclination to adopt new technologies were also reviewed. An important component of a consumer\u2019s motivation to adopt eco-friendly transport is perceived financial benefit. This suggests that incentives beyond reduced emissions may be required to motivate consumer adoption of vehicle-based CCS because the link between emissions and fuel consumption may change.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "b5dd418a95e63e79c8e2985118092f594d00a7b2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2415211648", "DOI": "10.2172/1114088", "CorpusId": 156868557}, "title": "Impact of Wind and Solar on the Value of Energy Storage", "abstract": "This analysis evaluates how the value of energy storage changes when adding variable generation (VG) renewable energy resources to the grid. A series of VG energy penetration scenarios from 16% to 55% were generated for a utility system in the western United States. This operational value of storage (measured by its ability to reduce system production costs) was estimated in each VG scenario, considering provision of different services and with several sensitivities to fuel price and generation mix. Overall, the results found that the presence of VG increases the value of energy storage by lowering off-peak energy prices more than on-peak prices, leading to a greater opportunity to arbitrage this price difference. However, significant charging from renewables, and consequently a net reduction in carbon emissions, did not occur until VG penetration was in the range of 40%-50%. Increased penetration of VG also increases the potential value of storage when providing reserves, mainly by increasing the amount of reserves required by the system. Despite this increase in value, storage may face challenges in capturing the full benefits it provides. Due to suppression of on-/off-peak price differentials, reserve prices, and incomplete capture of certain system benefits (such as the cost of power plant starts), the revenue obtained by storage in a market setting appears to be substantially less than the net benefit (reduction in production costs) provided to the system. Furthermore, it is unclear how storage will actually incentivize large-scale deployment of renewables needed to substantially increase VG penetration.

To demonstrate that robust estimates of CO2-e savings can be obtained at reasonable cost, an integrated approach of community-based subsampling of traditional and improved stoves in homes to estimate fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, combined with spatially explicit community-based estimates of the fraction of nonrenewable biomass harvesting (fNRB), was used to estimate CO2-e savings for 603 homes with improved Patsari stoves in Pur\u00e9pecha communities of Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico. Mean annual household CO2-e savings for CO2, CH4, CO, and nonmethane hydrocarbons were 3.9 tCO2-e home(-1) yr(-1) (95% Cl +/- 22%), and for Kyoto gases (CO2 and CH4) were 3.1 tCO2-e home(-1) yr(-1) (95% Cl +/- 26%), respectively, using a weighted mean fNRB harvesting of 39%. CO2-e savings ranged from 1.6 (95% Cl +/- 49%) to 7.5 (95% Cl +/- 17%) tCO2-e home(-1) yr(-1) for renewable and nonrenewable harvesting in individual communities, respectively. Since emission factors, fuel consumption, and fNRB each contribute significantly to the overall uncertainty in estimates of CO2-e savings, community-based assessment of all of these parameters is critical for robust estimates. Reporting overall uncertainty in the CO2-e savings estimates provides a mechanism for valuation of carbon offsets, which would promote better accounting that CO2-e savings had actually been achieved. Cost of CO2-e savings as a result of adoption of Patsari stoves was U.S. $8 per tCO2-e based on initial stove costs, monitoring costs, and conservative stove adoption rates, which is approximately 4 times less expensive than use of carbon capture and storage from coal plants, and approximately 18 times less than solar power.

In two successive experiments, the effects of elevated temperature (ambient plus 2 \u00b0C) at both ambient and elevated CO2 conditions (ambient plus 200 ppm) were investigated. A 40:60 sand:Surrey loam mixture with relatively low nutrient levels was used. Each experiment ran for 9 months and soil microbial biomass (Cmic and Nmic), soil microbial community (fungal and bacterial phospholipid fatty acids), basal respiration, and enzymes involved in the carbon cycling (xylanase, trehalase) were measured at depths of 0\u20132, 0\u201310 and 10\u201320 cm. In addition, root biomass and tissue C:N ratio were determined to provide information on the amount and quality of substrates for microbial growth.Elevated temperature under both ambient and elevated CO2 did not show consistent treatment effects. Elevation of air temperature at ambient CO2 induced an increase in Cmic of the 0\u201310 cm layer, while at elevated CO2 total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) increased after the third generation. The metabolic quotient qCO2 decreased at elevated temperature in the ambient CO2 run. Xylanase and trehalase showed no changes in both runs. Root biomass and C:N ratio were not influenced by elevated temperature in ambient CO2. In elevated CO2, however, elevated temperature reduced root biomass in the 0\u201310 cm and 30\u201340 cm layers and increased N content of roots in the deeper layers. The different response of root biomass and C:N ratio to elevated temperature may be caused by differences in the dynamics of root decomposition and/or in allocation patterns to coarse or fine roots (i.e. storage vs. resource capture functions).

These formations offer large pore volumes and good pore connectivity and are abundant (Bachu, 2003; U.S. Geological Survey Geologic Carbon Dioxide Storage Resources Assessment Team, 2013).

However, even relatively optimistic projections suggest that family planning and female education will suffer from financing deficits that will leave millions of women unserved in the coming decades. Since both activities affect fertility, population growth, and carbon emissions, they may also provide sufficient climate-related benefits to warrant additional financing from resources devoted to carbon emissions abatement. This paper considers the economic case for such support. Using recent data on emissions, program effectiveness and program costs, we estimate the cost of carbon emissions abatement via family planning and female education. We compare our estimates with the costs of numerous technical abatement options that have been estimated by Naucler and Enkvist in a major study for McKinsey and Company (2009). We find that the population policy options are much less costly than almost all of the options Naucler and Enkvist provide for low-carbon energy development, including solar, wind, and nuclear power, second-generation biofuels, and carbon capture and storage. They are also cost-competitive with forest conservation and other improvments in forestry and agricultural practices. We conclude that female education and family planning should be viewed as viable potential candidates for financial support from global climate funds. The case for female education is also strengthened by its documented contribution to resilience in the face of the climate change that has already become inevitable.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "120847b4c781cab0c2432862ef29aed071a89926", "externalIds": {"MAG": "587556110", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-444-63455-9.50015-5", "CorpusId": 92905237}, "title": "Assessment of Hydrogen Production Systems based on Natural Gas Conversion with Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "4c60caf4f394e75fa1e1a6a71ae843670520e9a1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2092240107", "DOI": "10.1115/1.1850501", "CorpusId": 110260771}, "title": "Chemical Looping Combustion for Combined Cycles with CO2 Capture", "abstract": "Chemical-Looping Combustion (CLC) is a process where fuel oxidation is carried out through an intermediate agent-a metal oxide-circulated across two fluidized bed reactors: a reduction reactor, where an endothermic reaction reduces the metal oxide and oxidizes the fuel, and an oxidation reactor, where an exothermic reaction oxidizes the metal oxide in air. Overall, the system carries out the same job of a conventional combustor, with the fundamental advantage of segregating the oxidation products (CO 2 and H 2 O) into an output flow free of nitrogen and excess oxygen. The flow exiting the reduction reactor consists of water and CO 2 , the latter readily available for liquefaction, transport and long-term storage. The hot, vitiated air from the oxidation reactor is the means to produce power through a thermodynamic cycle.

The CLC system is based on iron oxides which, to maintain their physical characteristics, must operate below 900-1000\u00b0C. Given the crucial importance of the temperature of the vitiated air generated by CLC on the performance of the combined cycle, we consider two options: (i) \"unfired\" systems, where natural gas is fed only to the CLC system, (ii) \"fired\" systems, where the vitiated air is supplementary fired to reach gas turbine inlet temperatures ranging 1000-1200\u00b0C.

Electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), one kind of the electrochemical capacitors, generally provide the merits of high charge-discharge rates, extremely long cycle life, and high efficiency in electricity capture/storage, leading to a desirable device of electricity management from portable electronics to hybrid vehicles or even smart grid application. However, the low cell voltage (2.5-2.7 V in organic liquid electrolytes) of EDLCs lacks the direct combination of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and EDLCs for creating new functions in future applications without considering the issue of a relatively low energy density. Here we propose a guideline, \"choosing a matching pair of electrode materials and electrolytes\", to effectively extend the cell voltage of EDLCs according to three general strategies.

The energy sector is the key admitter for global GHG emissions, and a range of optimisation and modelling tool has been developed to minimise the GHG emissions and overall cost, especially for the implementation of renewable energies such as biofuel and biogas. A few carbon sequestration technologies such as the carbon capture and storage (CCS) and biochar application have been reviewed. The review included the challenges and knowledge gaps regarding the utilisation of CCS, such as the storage capacity, long-term policy framework, high costs and the potential risk. Although solid waste contributes about\u00a0<\u00a05% of the global GHG emissions, effective solid waste management remained a great challenge in many fast-growing cities in Asia.

A range of waste management tools, including scenario analyses on different waste technologies, optimisation of waste collection routes, multi-criteria decision tools, is reviewed to support the decision-making for solid waste management. A range of environmental management system (EMS) has been adopted by organisations to improve product quality, reducing production cost and improves reputation of firms.

However, fast deactivations of CaO sorbents and low CO2 uptake in the fast carbonation stage are major drawbacks of this technology. For the first time, we developed a green approach through the reuse of nanosilica derived from coal fly ash (CFA) to enhance both the cyclic CO2 uptakes and the sorption kinetics of CaO sorbents. The as-synthesized nanosilica-supported CaO sorbent showed superior cyclic stability even under realistic carbonation/calcination conditions, and maintained a final CO2 uptake of 0.20 g(CO2) g(sorbent)-1 within short carbonation time, markedly increased by 155% over conventional CaO sorbent. Significantly, it also exhibited very fast sorption rate and could achieve almost 90% of the total CO2 uptake within \u223c20 s after the second cycle, which is critical for practical applications. These positive effects were attributed to the formation of larnite (Ca2SiO4) and the physical nanostructure of silica, which could yield and keep abundant reactive small pores directly exposed to CO2 throughout multiple cycles.

The combination of CCS and biomass combustion would result in a reduction of atmospheric CO2, or net negative emissions, as plant growth is a form of sequestration of atmospheric carbon. Carbon capture can be achieved in a variety of ways, one of which is chemical looping. Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) and chemical looping gasification (CLG) are two promising technologies for conversion of biomass to heat and power or syngas/methane with carbon capture. There have been significant advances made with respect to CLC in the last two decades for all types of fuel, with much less research on the gasification technology. CLG offers some interesting opportunities for production of biofuels together with carbon capture and may have several advantages with respect to the bench mark indirect gasification process or dual-bed fluidized bed (DFBG) in this respect. In CLG, an oxygen carrier is used as a bed material instead of sand, which is common in indirect gasification, and this could have several advantages: (i) all generated CO2 is present together with the syngas or methane in the fuel reactor outlet stream, thus in a concentrated stream, viable for separation and capture; (ii) the air reactor (or combustion chamber) should largely be free from trace impurities, thus preventing corrosion and fouling in this reactor; and (iii) the highly oxidizing conditions in the fuel reactor together with solid oxide surfaces should be advantageous with respect to limiting formation of tar species. In this study, two manganese ores and an iron-based waste material, LD slag, were investigated with respect to performance in these chemical-looping technologies. The materials were also impregnated with alkali (K) in order to gauge possible catalytic effects and also to establish a better understanding of the general behavior of oxygen carriers with alkali, an important component in biomass and biomass waste streams and often a precursor for high-temperature corrosion. The viability of the oxygen carriers was investigated using a synthetic biogas in a batch fluidized bed reactor. The conversion of CO, H2, CH4, and C2H4 was investigated in the temperature interval 800\u2013950\u00a0\u00b0C. The reactivity, or oxygen transfer rate, was highest for the manganese ores, followed by the LD slag. The conversion of C2H4 was generally high but could largely be attributed to thermal decomposition. The K-impregnated samples showed enhanced reactivity during combustion conditions, and the Mangagran-K sample was able to achieve full conversion of benzene. The interaction of the solid material with alkali showed widely different behavior. The two manganese ores retained almost all alkali after redox testing, albeit exhibiting different migration patterns inside the particles. LD slag lost most alkali to the gas phase during testing, although some remained, possibly explaining a small difference in reactivity. In summary, the CLC and CLG processes could clearly be interesting for production of heat, power, or biofuel with negative CO2 emissions. Manganese ores are most promising from this study, as they could absorb alkali, giving a better conversion and perhaps also inhibiting or limiting corrosion mechanisms in a combustor or gasifier.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "fa214a43868fc5e2eefe12f658e1d1c2cd26e4e6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2052466904", "DOI": "10.1504/IJSSOC.2010.033625", "CorpusId": 155055722}, "title": "Beyond CO2lonialism: the potential for fair trade certification to embrace voluntary carbon offsets", "abstract": "Carbon offset projects are a short-term solution to a long-term problem.

Carbon dioxide capture, transport, and storage (CCS) from fossil fuel fired power plants is drawing increased interest as an intermediate solution towards sustainable energy systems in the long term. However, CCS is still facing some challenges, such as large scale implementation requires high energy demands and leads to high cost. Innovation and optimization of the capture process is needed to reduce the energy requirement and to minimize the investment cost in order to make CCS viable for application in the near future. The CO2 post-combustion capture based on the absorption/desorption process with monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, is considered as the state-of-art technology. In this thesis, the MEA process has been defined as the reference case for the purposes of comparison and benchmarking. By analysing the MEA reference case, it can be concluded that this is an energy intensive process due to the regeneration energy of the MEA solution (4 GJ/tonne CO2). For this conventional process, major energy savings can be realized by optimizing the lean solvent loading, the amine solvent concentration, as well as the stripper operating pressure. A minimum thermal energy requirement of 3.0 GJ/tonne CO2 can be obtained using a 40 wt. % MEA solution and a stripper operating pressure of 210 kPa. Significant energy and cost savings can be achieved by increasing the MEA concentration in the absorption solution. It is, however, still to be investigated if high MEA concentrations can be used due to possible corrosion and solvent degradation. Increasing the temperature (operating pressure) in the stripper will lead to a higher efficiency of the regeneration and will reduce thermal energy requirement. Moreover, a high operating pressure will reduce the cost and the energy needed for CO2 compression. The economic baseline for CO2 post-combustion capture using MEA is defined using 600 MWe coal fired power plant as a reference case and assuming 2005 as the reference year, 8% discount factor and 25 years as a project life. The process modelling results are used for providing the required input to the economic modelling. The economic evaluation for the MEA conventional process has shown that this process will lead to a cost of ~40 \u0080/tonne CO2 avoided. Using the baseline techno-economic evaluation as a starting point, a parameter study for the conventional CO2 post-combustion capture process is performed. The main operating variables considered in this study were the MEA solvent concentration, the CO2 removal percentage, the solvent lean loading, and the stripper operating pressure. The economic results show a minimum CO2 avoided cost of 33 \u0080/tonne CO2 with an optimized process conditions of 0.3 mol CO2/mol MEA lean solvent loading, using a 40 wt. % MEA solution and a stripper operating pressure of 210 kPa. This translates to 53 \u0080/MWh cost of electricity, compared to 31 \u0080/MWh for the power plant without capture. The difference in costs per tonne CO2 avoided is small for CO2 removal in the range between 80% and 95%. The CO2 post-combustion capture process overall performance is evaluated using pilot plant experimental results. Two different modelling approaches (equilibrium-stage and rate-based) are validated and compared using these large-scale pilot plant data. Equilibrium-stage and rate-based models are implemented using the commercial Aspen plus simulation tool. The study indicates that there are no major differences between the two modelling approaches in predicting the overall capture process behaviour for this pilot plant case (e.g. regeneration energy requirement, CO2 removal % and solvent rich loading). Hence an equilibrium-stage model was preferred as the basis for over-all process modelling and benchmarking different capture solvents in view of its lesser complexity. The rate-based model, however, did yield more accurate predictions of the temperature profiles and mass transfer inside the columns. As a result, for a detailed process design or understanding of the mass and energy profiles in the absorber and stripper columns, the rate-based approach should be applied. The Hypogen concept (electricity generation with co-production of hydrogen) is considered one of the future energy options. This option will facilitate the use of a clean source of energy (hydrogen) for purposes like transportation and heating. This concept is based on the use of syngas for power production with CO2 post-combustion capture incorporating the possibility of co-production of hydrogen (5-10% of the total syngas). In this concept, hydrogen is produced and purified in two different methods. The first method is based on increasing hydrogen content using the water gas shift reaction, followed by the separation of hydrogen from CO2 using a high-pressure absorber. This absorber column is integrated with the ambient post-combustion capture process. The second method is based on the separation of hydrogen from syngas using polymeric membranes. In both options, the hydrogen will be further purified using a pressure swing adsorption system. Both options are feasible with an overall CO2 capture cost comparable to the conventional post-combustion capture process. However, there are some limitations in the hydrogen purity using polymeric membranes. The advantage of the high-pressure absorber is more obvious if an advanced solvent, like the sterically hindered 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), is used instead of a conventional solvent like MEA. Increasing the CO2 content in the flue gas is investigated by recycling the flue gas over the gas turbine. The flue gas recycle is beneficial for the overall capture process behaviour. The total flue gas flow rate is reduced with increasing flue gas recycle ratio. This reduction in the flue gas flow rate results in a smaller absorber column. The capital investment, the cost of electricity and cost of CO2 avoided are reduced with increasing the flue gas recycle ratio. There is a marginal effect of the flue gas recycle on the solvent regeneration energy using the conventional MEA solvent. This is due to the limitation in MEA solvent capacity. Moreover, the effect of the flue gas recycle on the energy requirement and the overall cost is more significant using a different solvent with higher loading capacity (e.g. AMP). As has been observed out of the MEA conventional process analysis, the desorption energy requirement is a significant burden for large-scale applications. To overcome the high-energy demand and to increase the operational flexibility, a new process concept is investigated. This process concept is based on dividing the CO2 capture process into a bulk removal step and a deep removal step using two different solvent/systems. This two-step concept is evaluated for two different cases. Both cases are based on the use of MEA in the first step. In the second step, either AMP solution or coal/activated carbon is used for the removal of the remaining CO2. The results show that the removal of CO2 using coal or activated carbon is not advantageous due to the large quantity of coal/activated carbon needed. On the hand, the use of the two-chemical solvent has shown potential for possible process improvement. The overall energy requirements for the two-solvent concept can be reduced by 16 % as compared to the MEA reference case. Due to the higher capital costs, the overall cost of carbon dioxide avoided in the 2-step concept increases by 13 %. Still, increasing the capture process flexibility can be an advantage of the 2-step concept. This flexibility allows the application of different operating conditions and/or process systems in the different absorption-desorption units. One of the benefits can be the use of waste heat for regeneration, by operating one of the desorbers at lower temperature. From the analysis of the post-combustion capture process that has been done in this thesis, it is evident that to achieve significant reduction of the capture process cost, multiple process parameters need to be improved. For future development of the CO2 post-combustion capture process, it would be beneficial to direct the solvent development research towards solvents systems, which have lower reaction enthalpy and higher capacity. A significant improvement can be obtained by the development of solvent systems where the solvent is regenerated at higher pressure. In addition, smart process improvement and integration are required to achieve a reasonable cost reduction. Flue gas recycle over the gas turbine can contribute by reducing the overall capital investment. Splitting the capture process and/or combining it with co-production of hydrogen can be an extra economic parameter in the overall process optimization. It can be expected that by improving the process design and the solvent, implementation of post combustion capture on larger scale will be possible in the near future.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "9ff14e699453ef0df2b2be7cbcb6624701b0e16d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1591274364", "DOI": "10.3832/EFOR0319-0020378", "CorpusId": 129532082}, "title": "Il ruolo della macchia mediterranea nel sequestro del carbonio", "abstract": "Abstract: In the last decades human activities have fundamentally altered many biogeochemical cycles. The most prominent of these changes has been the modification of the global carbon cycle, and in particular the increase in the concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The CO2 increased from a preindustrial concentration of ca 280 ppm to 368 ppm in the year 2000. In 1997, the Third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) met in Kyoto, Japan, and produced a document (the Kyoto Protocol) of appropriate actions to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. Inside the protocol, the emission of carbon dioxide by anthropogenic activities is estimated together with the carbon stored in the vegetation. Forests play an important role to capture carbon. The vegetation accumulates through the absorption of atmospheric CO2 carbon into biomass. The carbon is stored in various pools in a ecosystem: living biomass, necromass, soil organic matter. Remarkable variations among carbon accumulates do occur, while little information on carbon stored by Mediterranean formations is available. In this review we place into context the role of Mediterranean formations in the global carbon cycle and climate change. We reviewed the studies that calculated biomass into Mediterranean vegetation and applied average values to estimate the biomass in the Mediterranean formation in Sicily. The results of present studies confirm the importance of Mediterranean vegetation, called \u201cmacchia\u201d, in terms of surface and the role played in the carbon storage. In fact the surface occupied in Sicily by macchia is about 300000 ha (12% of 2500000 ha total surface of Sicily) and the carbon storage is estimated from 2.25 to 18Mt of carbon. Implementation of such studies are necessary to estimate: 1) the carbon storage with more accuracy; 2) the carbon storage within the annual growth; 3) the carbon storage into the soil during the evolution of vegetation from degraded forms (e.g., annual praires) to high forest; 4) the effects of fire.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "68dc0dc8268417ea28e6a602ec53aa776db3eace", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2126156503", "DOI": "10.1177/002029401304600203", "CorpusId": 110365079}, "title": "Developing Measurement Facilities for Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "This paper describes two experimental facilities developed to carry out research and development of measurement instruments used in the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) industry.

MACs activated at a temperature of 700 \u00b0C had very high ultramicropore volumes, which are relevant for potent...", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "dcf61590fffc61b20935b2db5cc4281698ee9b00", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2805922343", "DOI": "10.1007/S41660-018-0050-5", "CorpusId": 135110662}, "title": "Multi Region Carbon Capture and Storage Network in Indonesia Using Pinch Design Method", "abstract": "Global warming, a rise in global temperatures average, is caused mainly by carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is one of the best solution to mitigate CO2. This technology is a series of activities starting from capturing CO2 (source), transporting it, and storing it to the suitable geological sink (sink). In the CCS process, matching between source and sink may face some obstacles, such as time availability, capacity limit, and location. These problems can be solved by pinch design method. The development of multi region CCS process was conducted in this study, with of South Sumatra and East Java as boundary area with a total of five sources and six sinks. The development was done by calculating capturable CO2 and cost needed using simultaneous and sequential method with time difference (\u0394tmin) 0, 5, and 10\u00a0years. The result of this research shows sequential method of CCS can capture the biggest amount of CO2 with 93.86% in \u0394tmin 0\u00a0years, while simultaneous method can capture 83.94% of CO2 in \u0394tmin 0\u00a0years. The least total annual cost is found in simultaneous method with \u0394tmin 4.6\u00a0years, which is US$ 159,259,000, compared to sequential method with \u0394tmin 4.5\u00a0years, which is US$ 166,667,000. Sequential method is best used if the CCS design prefers quantity of capturable CO2 over the cost needed.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "2aeb454f67cd99d69bc9d2e4cab3a3c1285f33ba", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2782933733", "DOI": "10.7569/jsee.2017.629523", "CorpusId": 133704562}, "title": "U.S. DOE\u2019s Economic Approaches and Resources for Evaluating the Cost of Implementing Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)", "abstract": "Abstract The United States Department of Energy and National Energy Technology Laboratory are world leaders in Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) research and analysis. They have developed resources and a set of economic tools to evaluate the cost to implement CCUS for each segment of the value chain: capture, transport, and storage. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the economic models and analytical approaches DOE/NETL has developed for assessing the CO2 capture, storage, and transport cost drivers that impact the entire CCUS value chain. Failure to effectively evaluate the economic opportunity for CCUS technology to reduce CO2 emissions would deter wide-spread deployment. DOE\u2019s economic models and resources enable a variety of possible analytical approaches to evaluate the economics associated with deploying CCUS. The resources are open-source so that interested stakeholder groups can apply them to their specific problems, and to enable feedback to improve these models moving forward.", "year": 2017}]}
