These problems stem from the essential permanence of biometric data, which (unlike secret passwords or physical tokens) cannot be refreshed or reissued if compromised. Our previously presented biometric-hash framework prescribes the integration of external (password or token-derived) randomness with user-specific biometrics, resulting in bitstring outputs with security characteristics (i.e., noninvertibility) comparable to cryptographic ciphers or hashes. The resultant BioHashes are hence cancellable, i.e., straightforwardly revoked and reissued (via refreshed password or reissued token) if compromised.

They capture light energy through photosynthesis and convert low energy inorganic compounds (carbon dioxide and water) into high energy complex organic compounds, such as carbohydrates and fats. Chromochloris zofingiensis is a unicellular microalga currently under intensive research, due to its ability to produce high value pharmaceutical and nutritional pigments. Understanding its growth characteristics is crucial for the establishment of an efficient commercial production of those pigments from this alga. Thus, we have developed a method to stain the nucleus of the alga which enabled us to follow the division pattern under commonly used cultivation methods. We found that C. zofingiensis cells conduct consecutive DNA synthesis and divisions of the nucleus to produce 8 or 16 nuclei before it divides into 8 or 16 daughter cells, respectively. Under high light illumination, the whole process lasts several days, through which cells grow during the light period and divide during the dark period. These findings can be assimilated for the development of the biotechnology process for high pigment productivity. Abstract Several green algae can divide by multiple fission and spontaneously synchronize their cell cycle with the available light regime. The yields that can be obtained from a microalgal culture are directly affected by cell cycle events. Chromochloris zofingiensis is considered as one of the most promising microalgae for biotechnological applications due to its fast growth and the flexible trophic capabilities. It is intensively investigated in the context of bio-commodities production (carotenoids, storage lipids); however, the pattern of cell-cycle events under common cultivation strategies was not yet characterized for C. zofingiensis. In this study, we have employed fluorescence microscopy to characterize the basic cell-cycle dynamics under batch and continuous modes of phototrophic C. zofingiensis cultivation. Staining with SYBR green\u2014applied in DMSO solution\u2014enabled, for the first time, the clear and simple visualization of polynuclear stages in this microalga. Accordingly, we concluded that C. zofingiensis divides by a consecutive pattern of multiple fission, whereby it spontaneously synchronizes growth and cell division according to the available illumination regime. In high-light continuous culture or low-light batch culture, C. zofingiensis cell-cycle was completed within several light-dark (L/D) cycles (14 h/10 h); however, cell divisions were synchronized with the dark periods only in the high-light continuous culture. In both modes of cultivation, daughter cell release was mainly facilitated by division of 8 and 16-polynuclear cells.

The programme is carried out in cooperation between the Research Council of Norway, which handles CLIMIT R&D, and Gassnova, which handles CLIMIT Demo. CLIMIT\u2019s primary objective is to contribute to the development of CCS technologies and solutions. CLIMIT has supported development of CCS technology in Norway for more than ten years. The knowledge and solutions created during this time have laid the technological foundation for building full-scale CCS projects in Norway. CLIMIT has also made significant contributions to CCS development outside Norway\u2019s borders. The current CLIMIT Programme Plan for 2017-2022 is focused on improved technological solutions through international cooperation. More cost effective solutions will be relevant in both the short and long term, and must be applicable beyond our own. CCS technology is available today. However, there are not many players that consider CCS to be a profitable climate measure. Some countries, including Norway, are therefore at the forefront when it comes to utilizing the technology through development of early full-scale CCS projects. These activities are important for promoting innovation, spreading the technology and steering technology development. The CLIMIT programme has identified three focus areas: A. Early full-scale CCS value chain in Europe B. Large-scale storage of CO2 on the Norwegian shelf in the North Sea C. Future solutions for CCS The main objective of this paper is to give a broad overview of the CLIMIT RD&D portfolio within capture, transport and storage and how it has laid the ground for future CCS deployment. The programme covers the entire development chain from research to demonstration. All aspects of the value chain from industrial processes with integrated CO2 capture, to transport and storage of CO2 are covered. The programme is open to projects aimed at capture of CO2 from power 2 generation, as well as other industrial sources. The requirement for long-term storage means that the programme can also support development of technology that utilises CO2 to make new products, provided the CO2 is not subsequently being released into the atmosphere. CLIMIT is a key instrument in the national CCS effort. The programme helps create a network of players that accumulate and spread expertise, and strengthen international CCS cooperation. The programme also contributes to a comprehensive national portfolio within CCS technology development. The projects that are granted support from the programme must contribute to reducing the costs and risks associated with CO2 capture, transport, and long-term storage. CLIMIT prioritize development of enabling capture technologies that has the potential to be more effective and with lower cost than today's more mature technologies. The CLIMIT program see an increasing interest in focusing on CO2 capture from industry and how to integrate the capture technology to the industrial processes benefitting on e.g. utilize waste heat sources to the capture cycle. Within storage research is focused on optimized methods for injection of CO2, improved understanding of physical and chemical processes in the reservoir and methods to detect the movement of the plume. There are also projects focusing on enhanced oil recovery (EOR) as a potential commercial driver for CO2 storage. CLIMIT contributes to competence and research capability within universities, institutes and industries with synergies to other national and international CCS instruments. International cooperation has high priority as the cross-Atlantic cooperation with American and Canadian capture and storage projects, and cooperation with Australia within the field of transportation/pipelines. CLIMIT also supports the ERA NET Cofund within CCS, called ACT (Accelerating CCS Technologies) where 9 countries collaborate on more rapidly mature technologies for commercialization.

There are however several bottlenecks regarding the assessment of sustainability and efficiency of bioenergy systems, especially for first-generation biomass (e.g. sugars and vegetable oils) (Chakravorty et al. 2009; European Commission 2010; Popp et al. 2014). The use of secondgeneration biomass (e.g. lignocellulosic biomass, agricultural residues) as a sustainable energy source has therefore gained increased attention by researchers and decision-makers (Pandiyan et al. 2019). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has stressed the use of secondand third-generation biomass (with and without carbon capture and storage) for attaining the 1.5 \u00b0C target of the Paris Agreement (IPCC 2018). Not surprisingly, the need for better understanding the environmental performance and trade-offs of large-scale biomass deployment has resulted in an increasing number of environmental assessment studies, mostly using environmental life cycle assessment (ELCA). One of the most enduring debates within the ELCA community is on handling multifunctional processes, which is a key feature of most bio-based processes. Here, we refrain from further dwelling on this discussion, but rather focus on discussing a specific approach to handling allocation and when it is used: the substitution method. In this discussion paper, we argue that the application of substitution in waste treatment processes in consequential ELCA has led to an overestimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to avoided emissions. Even though ELCAwas developed a long time ago and has been standardized by ISO 14040 and 14044 (International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 2006a, b), differences in results among studies are often due to the interpretation of the guidelines. This happens because the standardization of ELCA concerns only its structure and ELCA is an assessment tool which is used for a wide range of product systems. Therefore, frameworks are continuously being developed on key points of the goal and scope definition phase, such as how to handle multifunctional processes (Guinee 2002). Two main approaches exist in ELCA: attributional and consequential. According to the UNEP and SETAC (UNEP and SETAC 2011), attributional ELCA is defined as the portion of global environmental burdens that can be associated with a product\u2019s life cycle. Thus, it refers to a \u201cstatic\u201d or \u201csteady state\u201d system, a system fully integrated in a production-consumption system (Heijungs 1997; Sand\u00e9n and Karlstr\u00f6m 2007; Brander and Wylie 2011). Whereas, the consequential approach is defined as how physical flows and, consequently, environmental burdens will change in response to a change in the system under study (Finnveden et al. 2009). Handling multifunctionality is one of the most debated methodological choices in ELCA (Majeau-Bettez et al. 2018). Multifunctional processes consist of co-production, waste treatment and recycling. Multifunctionality is typically handled with partitioning, system expansion or substitution methods, with each method leading to different ELCA results. The ELCA literature links partition-based co-production modelling with attributional analysis, and substitution based modelling with consequential analysis (Zamagni et al. 2012; Pelletier et al. 2015; Schrijvers et al. 2016). Partitioning is linked with attributional ELCA since no activity has changed in the system under study (Heijungs and Guin\u00e9e 2007).

In a Perspective, Field and Mach caution that most of these technologies are in their infancy and that relying on their future large-scale use is risky. Techniques such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, reforestation, and afforestation to remove carbon dioxide would require vast amounts of land and water and thus endanger food security and biodiversity. Furthermore, allowing temperatures to peak as emissions continue and then decline as carbon dioxide is removed risks further instability in the Earth system and human society.\n\nScience , this issue p.

On the other hand, CO2 emissions resulting from burning fossil fuels continue to increase and contribute as a greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Global warming is a threat to the future of life. One of the countermeasures is by developing Carbon, Capture, and Utilization (CCU) technology based on a chemical absorption process to capture CO2 gas from combustion. The captured CO2 is then stored in a stable form so it will not be released into the atmosphere or used as raw material for the chemical industry. The main obstacle to implementing CCU technology on a large scale is the cost involved. Meanwhile, the revenue generated is relatively low. In CCU technology based on this chemical absorption process, chemicals as absorbents need to be regenerated and the CO2 is separated for storage or use. However, this regeneration requires a relatively high cost. Several studies have attempted to perform this regeneration with micro-algae-based bioprocesses. Micro-algae can take energy from sunlight which is abundant in tropical areas such as Indonesia. In addition, several types of micro algae have the potential to be used as food and other utilizations. This review will discuss the results of recent research on suitable chemicals for the absorption of CO2 from flue gas, its regeneration method using micro-algae, usable micro-algae species, and the potential for micro-algae utilization.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "c562a24403def2754c8bb2c81549268aa7378922", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2160341511", "DOI": "10.1002/9781118991978.HCES057", "CorpusId": 111003764}, "title": "Impacts of Impurities on CO2 Pipeline Transportation", "abstract": "CO2 transport is an integral part in the whole CCS (carbon capture and storage) chain.

The value proposition of six R&D focus areas, for CSP, are described and quantified. The focus areas are: 1. power block efficiency 2. power block cost 3. primary heater temperature change (\u0394T) 4. CSP HTM-to-sCO2 heat exchanger 5. dry cooling 6. Operation and maintenance (O&M), including consideration of autonomous CSP power cycle operation. In several areas, specific future technology improvement concepts are described. These development opportunities are shown to be consistent with the power block needs of CSP to become an impactful source of electricity in US markets and ultimately support SETO\u2019s 2030 technoeconomic targets. 1 Background and Motivation The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has set targets for the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) from solar photovoltaic (PV) and concentrating solar power (CSP) systems to enable wide deployment of both technologies in the US. Unlike PV systems, CSP technology captures and stores the sun\u2019s energy in the form of heat, using materials that are low cost and materially stable for decades. This allows CSP with thermal energy storage (TES) to deliver dispatchable renewable energy while providing important capacity, reliability and stability attributes to the grid, thereby enabling increased penetration of variable renewable electricity technologies. Today\u2019s most advanced CSP systems are towers integrated with a two tank, molten-salt thermal energy storage (TES), delivering thermal energy at 565 \u00b0C for integration with conventional steam-Rankine power cycles. They make use of a nitrate eutectic salt with a melting point of 222 \u00b0C as heat transfer fluid, and with a \u0394T of 270\u00b0C between the two tanks. These power towers trace their lineage to the 10-MWe pilot demonstration of Solar Two [1] in the 1990\u2019s. This design has lowered the cost of CSP electricity by approximately 50% over the prior generation of parabolic trough systems [2]. While recent advances in CSP deployment and cost reduction are both rapid and significant [3], the technology remains at a cost disadvantage compared to other forms of large scale power generation within the U.S. Recently, DOE\u2019s Solar Energy Technologies Office (SETO) announced 2030 LCOE goals for CSP of 5 \u00a2/kWh goal for baseload plants (\u2265 12 hours of TES), and 10 \u00a2/kWh for peaker plants (\u2264 6 hours of TES), without subsidies [4]. If achieved, these cost targets would enable significant deployment of CSP in the US in the absence of any policy influence. In 2010, a new CSP plant was estimated to be capable of generating electricity at an LCOE of 21 \u00a2/kWh; by 2017 that cost is estimated to have already fallen to 10 \u00a2/kWh for a baseload plant [2]. A key part of the strategy to enable further cost reductions is to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of CSP power cycles; sCO2-based turbomachinery is a promising approach. The design of a supercritical sCO2 cycle power block for a CSP plant, must be developed in parallel to the CSP plant that can deliver adequate temperatures to the power block to attain the SETO goals. In August of 2016, DOE hosted a workshop of CSP stakeholders that defined three potential pathways for the next generation CSP plant (Gen3 CSP) based on the form of the thermal carrier in the receiver [5]: molten salt, particle, or gaseous fluid. That August, 2016 meeting initiated a collaborative process that generated a \u201cGen3 CSP Roadmap\u201d that addresses and prioritizes research and development (R&D) gaps and lays out the potential technology development pathways. Technology gaps for each of the technology pathways were identified, together with research priorities designed to address them. Molten-Salt Pathway. Of the three pathways presented in this roadmap, molten-salt systems represent the most familiar approach. Conceptually there is no change from current state-of-the-art power tower design; however, the increase in hot-salt system temperature from 565\u00b0C to approximately 720\u00b0C brings significant material challenges. Although the engineering challenges associated with achieving the high receiver outlet temperature required to drive a sCO2 turbine at > 700\u00b0C are relatively well understood, knowledge about the selection of a high-temperature molten salt is needed, especially with regard to its impact on containment materials that can achieve acceptable strength, durability, and cost targets at these high temperatures. Solid Particle Pathway. The solid particle pathway consists of heating particles either directly, falling as a curtain in concentrated sunlight, or indirectly through a solar flux to particle heat exchanger. These hot particles can be stored and delivered to heat sCO2. Many of the thermal and material transport components for this pathway are mature and have been developed by the industry, including particle heat exchangers, storage bins, particle feeders, hoppers and lifts. Heating the particles with concentrated sunlight poses additional challenges with efficient particle heating, flow control and containment, erosion and attrition, and conveyance. Gas-Phase Pathway. The gas-phase technology pathway relies on an inert, stable gas-phase heat transfer fluid (HTF), such as carbon dioxide or helium, operating within a high-pressure receiver. Unlike the other two pathways, this pathway relies on indirect TES options such as a phase-change material or particle storage. Independent of the developed pathway, the sCO2 power cycle is an enabling technology that can support the CSP LCOE targets for any thermal transport system. The specific thermal transport pathway defines the input boundary conditions for the cycle. The subsequent section describes the cost and thermodynamic requirements of a compatible Brayton cycle as well as recent technical advances in its components. In a similar manner, Section 3 describes the competing research priorities that can be further developed to make the sCO2 cycle compatible and acceptable to the CSP plant. 2 Next generation CSP power cycle As a part of the SunShot initiative, the Department of Energy and its researchers had earlier conducted analyses of subsystem technoeconomic metrics compatible with the original LCOE goal of 6\u00a2/kWh [6]. One viable solution requires a power cycle with greater than 50% efficiency, a cost under $900/kWe, and dry cooling. Very large solar fields in a CSP system have diminishing optical efficiencies, necessitating power cycles viable at a smaller scale than supercritical steam. Developing power cycles, such as sCO2 Brayton cycles, have the best chance of attaining these goals. Analysis indicates that a cycle efficiency of 50% with dry cooling can be obtained at a turbine inlet temperature near 715\u00b0C for the recompression or partial cooling cycles [7, 8]. However, high compressor inlet temperatures due to dry cooling also require high turbine inlet pressures (20-30 MPa) and temperatures (700\u00b0C). Hence, SETO is focused on component development to attain such high turbine inlet pressures and temperatures and compressor inlet temperatures. In addition, to attain cycle efficiencies of 50%, recuperator conductance of 10-15 MW/K with the ability to withstand 550\u00b0C temperatures are needed. Many combinations of technical and cost metrics exist which would obtain the SETO LCOE targets. Two crucial power cycle related input that can significantly help control the LCOE are shown in Figure 1, namely, power cycle efficiency and capital cost per kWe. The results shown in Figure 1 were obtained by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) analysts using Solar Advisor Model (SAM), for the DOE. For the example shown in Figure 1, the baseline pathway to LCOE of 5 \u00a2/kWh requires a solar field cost of 50 $/m, power cycle efficiency of 50%, and power cycle cost of 900 $/kWe, while maintaining all other target costs; reducing the power cycle cost to 700 $/kWe results in relaxation of solar field cost to 70 $/m at a power cycle efficiency of 50%; further relaxing power cycle efficiency to 47% requires reduction of solar field cost to 60 $/m. This figure describes optimization that can be performed by integral changes to component costs that can lead to the achievement of the LCOE of 5\u00a2/kWh. Similar analysis can be performed for the 10 \u00a2/kWh peaker target. Such analysis indicates much greater priority should be placed on power cycle cost and O&M targets rather than solar field cost and power cycle efficiency for the peaker scenario. 3 sCO2 Cycle Technology Improvement Focus Areas Highlighted here are six significant technology improvement focus areas for the CSP application. Each of the focus areas provide an opportunity for CSP; however the value of that opportunity needs to be quantified in cost, performance, or LCOE terms. Each focus area is then be expanded in discuss future research opportunities. The focus areas discussed are: 1. Power block efficiency 2.

Until now, atomic physics experiments at the ESR storage ring focused on initially bare and hydrogen-like ions. However, there is an increasing demand to extend the range of possible structure and collision studies to heavy high-Z multi-electron systems such as helium-, lithium-, or beryllium-like ions. To accomplish the storage of intense heavy few-electron systems even at the highest beam energies possible at the ESR, thin carbon stripper foils are now available in the beam transfer line between SIS and ESR. In contrast to the commonly used copper stripper targets, carbon foils guarantee a strong yield enhancement for heavy multi-electron ions (see. Fig. 1). Very recently, this new possibility for atomic physics experiments has been exploited by injecting intense SIS beams of lithiumlike uranium into the ESR at an energy of 217 MeV/u. In this experiment, projectile x-ray emission arising from collisions with a N2 target was measured by intrinsic germanium detectors in coincidence with down-charged or up-charged ions, i.e. ions having captured (U) or lost (U) one-electron in the collision. For a detailed description of this set-up we refer to Ref. [1]. In the following we concentrate on the process of K-shell ionization. In Fig. 2 the x-ray spectrum observed at an forward angle of \u2248 10 in coincidence with electron-loss is depicted. The spectrum is entirely governed by an intense single L\u2192K (K\u03b12) transition and a broad continuum distribution. Since we are dealing with He-like uranium produced by K-shell vacancy production of the Li-like species, the broad continuum can be explained by the two-photon decay (2E1) of the [1s1/2, 2s1/2]S0 level. Consequently, the single K\u03b1 transition observed arises exclusively from the M1 decay of the [1s1/2, 2s1/2]S1 state. To the best of our knowledge, no other process occurring in ion-atom collisions is known with such a high state selectivity. This also means that the 2s-electron stays passive during a collision leading to K-shell ionization because no decay from the neighouring excited p-states is observed (see level scheme inserted in Fig. 2). This unexpected and surprising finding is currently subject of theoretical studies.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "e6ea91c5a278ce57554923c6ce547dc3a2ad3035", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2366919516", "CorpusId": 130228671}, "title": "Policy on Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of CCUS in China", "abstract": "Carbon capture,utilization and storage(CCUS) has being become a strategic technology option to help reduce CO2emissions.It has been reported that CCUS project possible harm to atmosphere,surface water,groundwater,ecology,geology and so on.To provide reference for the related management department decisions,the paper proposed countermeasuresbased onanalysis of existing regulations in the EU,England,America,Canada,Australia to assess their applicability to CCUS,and identify regulatory gaps in China", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "a98eaf2c7e0386e4f93e9683f4d22db0df0016c4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1435404396", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-642-53962-6_7", "CorpusId": 60561687}, "title": "Numerical Simulation of the Effects of N2 on the Solubility Trapping Mechanism of CO2", "abstract": "Parallel computations are carried out to investigate the effects of impurity on geological storage of carbon dioxide.

Based on this technique, TNO aims at developing a methodology for efficient monitoring of CO2 geological sequestration in Carbon Capture and Storage projects. In 2009, as a collaboration with the CO2SINK research project on CO2 sequestration taking place in Ketzin, Germany, TNO installed a permanent seismic array that has now already been recording passive data for 2 years during the CO2-injection. The correlation of the large real datasets requires a prior assessment on the feasibility of SI with ambient noise for time-lapse monitoring of the C02 storage process. Using a 1D layered acoustic velocity model of the Ketzin storage site as well as the layout of the TNO\u2019s permanent array, we perform passive experiments that involve finite-difference modelling of passive wavefields from random noise sources and the cross-correlation of these passive synthetic data to retrieve reflection responses. By repeating the experiment for base and monitor velocity scenarios from CO2 saturation changes in the reservoir, we study the influence of various noise parameters (the number of sources, the sources\u2019 duration, the spatial distribution) on the retrieved base and monitor reflection responses as well as their induced amplitude differences. We show that, for a sufficient number of sources with sufficient durations, the accuracy of the retrieved reflection responses from the CO2 reservoir are close enough to the reference responses from an active surface shot. More generally, the retrieved reflections are improved when more sources lie at or close to stationary points. In addition, when the sources characteristics are identical for both the base and the monitor passive experiments, the amplitude differences between the retrieved base and monitor reflection responses exhibit clear information on reflection changes from the reservoir. However we show that, when the sources\u2019 characteristics, such as their spatial random distribution only, are not close enough for the base and the monitor passive experiments, the induced amplitude differences are difficult to interpret. Processing of the recorded body-wave noise prior to cross-correlation might be then necessary. We conclude that the repeatability of the passive noise is crucial for time-lapse interpretation. Finally, we choose an ideal noise configuration to enhance repeatability of the passive experiments when using different random distributions of the sources. In this special case, plotting picked amplitudes from the retrieved reflection responses for different velocity scenarios illustrates the potential of monitoring the velocity changes from SI with ambient noise.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "629460739ac1b195ff22a9515e10c50191d93e76", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3099801828", "DOI": "10.5194/egusphere-egu2020-5461", "CorpusId": 229159193}, "title": "Can biomass supply meet the demands of BECCS?", "abstract": "\n <p>In order to reach the reduced carbon emission targets proposed by the Paris agreement one of the widely proposed decarbonizing strategies, referred to as negative emissions technologies (NETs), is the production and combustion of second-generation bioenergy crops in conjunction with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). The international research on NETs has grown rapidly and publications have ranged in scope from reviewing potential and assessing feasibility to technological maturity and discussions on deployment opportunities. However, concerns have been increasingly raised that ungrounded optimism in NETs potential could result in delayed reductions in gross CO<sub>2</sub> emission, with consequent high-risk of overshooting global temperature targets. Negative emissions as a consequence of BECCS are achieved when the CO<sub>2</sub> absorbed from the atmosphere during the growth cycle of biomass is released in combustion and energy production and then captured and stored indefinitely. The simplistic vision of BECCS is that one ton of CO<sub>2</sub> captured in the growth of biomass would equate to one ton of CO<sub>2</sub> sequestered geologically- which we can regard as a carbon efficiency of 1. However, biomass crops are not carbon neutral as GHG emissions are associated with the cultivation of biomass.&#160; Furthermore, throughout the BECCS value chain carbon &#8216;leaks&#8217;. Some life cycle analyses of the entire value chain for a BECCS crop to final carbon storage in the ground have shown leakage of CO<sub>2</sub> to be greater than the CO<sub>2</sub> captured at the point of combustion and thus it has low carbon efficiency. The deployment of BECCS is ultimately reliant on the availability of sufficient, sustainably sourced, biomass for an active CCS industry operating at scale and a favourable policy and commercial environment to incentivise these investments. It has been suggested that the theoretical global demand for biomass for BECCS could range from 50 EJ/yr up to more than 300 EJ/yr, although the technical and economic potential will be significantly less and will be dependent on uncertain social preferences and economic forces. The two most important factors determining this supply are land availability and land productivity. These factors are in turn determined by competing uses of land and a myriad of environmental and economic considerations. It is suggested that removing 3.3 GtC/year with BECCS could annually require between 360 and 2400 Mha of marginal land. The upper bounds correspond to 3x the world&#8217;s harvested land for cereal production. The conclusion is that estimates of biomass availability for the future depends on the evolution of a multitude of social, political, and economic factors including land tenure and regulation, trade, and technology. Consequently, the assumptions, in future climate scenarios, that high rates of NETs can be achieved across many countries and land types is not yet demonstrated.</p><p>&#160;</p>\n", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "6f753734b546fef20d3b71c4bf9bbed3bd986a96", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2566738851", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-31655-0_4", "CorpusId": 132257593}, "title": "Electricity Generator Costs and Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "abstract": "The capital costs and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from various types of electricity power plants will determine the least cost option for achieving our goal of reducing GHG emissions by at least 58 % below 1990 levels from the electricity generation sector (as a major part of our goal of reducing all GHG emissions by 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050).

The assessment of environmental sustainability has been carried out using life cycle assessment; capital, annualised and levelised costs have been used for the economic sustainability and various social indicators along the life cycle of the technologies have been estimated for the social assessment. Multi-criteria decision analysis has been carried out to integrate the three dimensions of sustainability for current electricity generation and future scenarios as well as to help with decision-making. The sustainability assessment of current electricity generation considers all the options present in the Turkish electricity mix: coal (lignite, hard coal), gas, hydro (large and small scale reservoir, run-of-river), onshore wind and geothermal. Each technology has been assessed and compared using 20 sustainability indicators, addressing 11 environmental, three economic and six social aspects. The findings suggest that trade-offs are needed, as each technology is better for some sustainability indicators but worse for others. For example, coal has the highest environmental impacts, except for ozone depletion for which gas is the worst option; gas is the cheapest in terms of capital costs but it provides the lowest direct employment and has the highest levelised costs. Geothermal is the best option for six environmental impacts but has the highest capital cost. Large reservoir has the lowest depletion of elements and fossil resources as well as acidification. Moreover, large reservoir is the cheapest option in terms of levelised costs and the best option for worker injuries and fatalities but provides the lowest life cycle employment. The results for the current electricity sector show that electricity generation in Turkey is responsible for around 111 million tonnes of CO2 eq. emissions annually. Total capital costs of the current electricity sector of Turkey are estimated at US$69 billion, with hydropower, coal and gas plants contributing together to 96%. Total annualised costs are equal to US$26 billion per year, of which fuel costs contribute nearly 64%. The levelised costs for the Turkish electricity generation are estimated at 123 US$/MWh. The social assessment results indicate that the electricity sector in Turkey provided 57,000 jobs. A total of 3670 worker injuries and 15 fatalities are also estimated related to the electricity sector annually.A range of future electricity generation scenarios has been developed for the year 2050 considering different mixes, carbon emission targets and generation options, including fossil-fuel technologies with and without carbon capture and storage, nuclear and a range of renewable options. Overall, business-as-usual scenarios are the least sustainable options to meet the country?s electricity demand in the future. Despite the fact that these scenarios have the lowest costs, their poor environmental and social performances make them the worst options. Increasing the contribution from renewables and nuclear power translates to a better sustainability performance. The scenario with the highest penetration of these options (C-3) is found to be the most sustainable option in this work. Although the most renewable intensive scenario (C-4) scores as the second best option overall, it performs poorly for the economic categories.The trade-offs between the different sustainability indicators highlighted by the results of this research illustrate that assessments of a range of environmental, economic and social impacts from different electricity technologies and scenarios should be considered when planning sustainability strategies for the electricity sector.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "e02c605b3ed2ceb3dfc1e04e1ec739b7d9e5371f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2054371952", "DOI": "10.1115/IPC2010-31015", "CorpusId": 110865815}, "title": "Thermodynamic and Economic Assessment of Oxy-Combustion CCS System Applied to Gas Turbine-Driven Compressor Stations", "abstract": "Government policies currently in place or in development will require the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from industry, including gas transmission systems.

Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions can be accomplished through post-combustion systems (separation of CO2 from flue gases through chemical absorption, physical adsorption, membrane or cryogenic systems) or through oxy-fuel combustion, where fuel is combusted in pure O2 leading to sequestration of CO2 by compression and dehydration of the exhaust gases.

The paper presents various innovation options arrived at, detailed thermodynamic parameters, and a cost and economic evaluation of these options. Particular emphasis was placed on the application of this technology to a typical compressor station on a natural gas transmission system as this application is vastly different than a typical power plant contemplating or employing carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems, most notably from the small power size, the remote location, and the self-containment perspectives.Copyright \u00a9 2010 by ASME", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "ee1d0cbc1348ce6d8dbac2deeba10378512bc4f9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3004806505", "DOI": "10.1088/1755-1315/371/3/032071", "CorpusId": 212802993}, "title": "Improving Public Acceptance of Carbon Capture and Storage(CCS) in China", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "1912b5cc0264e761c8eb4252452327ec8eb2596c", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/tos/CarnsHABLLR11", "MAG": "2021171338", "DOI": "10.1145/2027066.2027068", "CorpusId": 16672348}, "title": "Understanding and improving computational science storage access through continuous characterization", "abstract": "Computational science applications are driving a demand for increasingly powerful storage systems.

During CO 2 injection, the efficacy and distribution of fluid flow in sandstone reservoirs is controlled by the pore-throat microstructure of the rock. Furthermore, CO 2 injection promotes asphaltene precipitation on the pore surface and can also affect fluid flow in the pore throats, decreasing the permeability and altering reservoir wettability. In this work, miscible and immiscible CO 2 flooding experiments under reservoir conditions (up to 70\u00e2&#132;&#131;, 18 MPa) have been carried out on four samples with very similar permeabilities but different pore-throat structures in order to study the effects of porethroat microstructure on formation damage. The features of pore-throat structure were evaluated by fractal theory, based on pore size distributions and rate-controlled porosimetry (RCP) mercury intrusion curves. Reservoir rocks with smaller pore throat sizes and more heterogeneous and poorer pore-throat microstructures were found to be more sensitive to asphaltene precipitation, with corresponding 15-20% lower oil recovery and 4-7% greater decreases in permeability than that of rocks with homogeneous and better pore-throat microstructure. However, the waterwettability index of cores with larger and more connected pore-throat microstructures was found to drop by an extra 15-25% than heterogeneous core due to more asphaltene precipitation caused by the larger sweep volume of injected CO 2 they consequently experienced, which is a disadvantage for EOR. In addition, immiscible flooding exacerbates the differences from 4-7% to 8-15% in permeability decline of the rocks with different pore-throat structures. Miscible flooding leads to more asphaltenes being precipitated from the crude oil, triggering in average an extra 11% change in wettability in comparison to immiscible flooding.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "a8fbfcf08788b2eddf5e8bd31a2bf691deb21603", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3088980560", "DOI": "10.31031/eaes.2018.01.000521", "CorpusId": 233082642}, "title": "Are Polar Continental Shelves Economic to 'Farm' for Increased Carbon Capture and Storage?", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "8f2fb62a8d31d861133fecdc97576df9c0bbf13c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2809699522", "CorpusId": 134120830}, "title": "Carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) as a regional development tool: Planning and design considerations", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "40b68b1fb5151b39dad976b01bc2aeb8cd185ed2", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.5194/soil-2021-73", "CorpusId": 243859114}, "title": "Additional soil organic carbon storage potential in global croplands", "abstract": "Abstract. Soil organic carbon sequestration (SOCseq) is considered the most attractive carbon capture technology to partially mitigate climate change. However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the potential of SOCseq. The additional storage potential on existing global cropland is missing. SOCseq is region-specific and conditioned by management but most global estimates use fixed accumulation rates or time frames. Here, we show how the SOC storage potential and its steady state varies globally depending on climate, land use and soil. Using 83,416 soil observations, we developed a quantile regression neural network that quantifies the SOC variation within soils with similar characteristics. This allows us to identify similar areas that present higher SOC with the difference representing an additional storage potential. The estimated additional SOC storage potential of 29 to 67\u2009Pg\u2009C in the topsoil of global croplands equates to only 2 to 5 years of emissions offsetting and 32\u2009% of agriculture's 92\u2009Pg historical carbon debt estimate due to conversion from natural ecosystems.

Post-combustion CO2 capture (PCC) with amine-based absorption and desorption has been widely investigated for many years for various aspects such as removal efficiency, different types of amines, energy demand and different process configurations. CO2 absorption with monoethanolamine (MEA) is considered as a benchmark process to evaluate PCC. Physical properties like density and viscosity of MEA change through the process due to changes in process conditions especially temperature and CO2 loading. In the design of process equipment, it is important to know how these properties vary in operation in order to optimize the design. In this study, the main interest is given to analyze the variations in density and viscosity of MEA in the CO2 absorption and compare them with predictions obtained through literature correlations. The CO2rig located at University College of Southeast Norway was used for all experiments. The experiments were done at the different gas to liquid ratios and samples were taken at different points in the column. For each point, temperature CO2 loadings, viscosity and density of MEA were measured. The temperatures were measured by Pt-1000 temperature sensors, CO2 loading was analyzed by titration, density was measured by an Anton Paar 4500 density meter and viscosity was measured by an Anton Paar Physica 101 reometer. The measured density and viscosity were compared with correlations given by Weiland and Hartono for the CO2 loaded MEA.

Hybridisation, which involves combining the two energy sources within a single plant, offers these benefits over the stand-alone counterparts through the use of shared infrastructure and increased efficiency. In the near-term, hybrids between solar and fossil fuelled systems without carbon capture offer potential to lower the use of fossil fuels, while in the longer term they offer potential for low-cost carbon-neutral or carbon-negative energy. The integration of CST into CO2 capture technologies such as oxy-fuel combustion and chemical looping combustion is potentially attractive because the same components can be used for both CO2 capture and the storage of solar energy, to reduce total infrastructure and cost. The use of these hybrids with biomass and/or renewable fuels, offers the additional potential for carbon-negative energy with relatively low cost.

Soon after the discovery of carbon nanotubes in 1991, different research groups succeeded in filling carbon nanotubes with some elements, and, therefore, the question arose of filling carbon nanotubes with hydrogen by possibly using new effects such as nano-capillarity. Subsequently, very promising experiments claiming high hydrogen storage capacities in different carbon nanostructures initiated enormous research activity. Hydrogen storage capacities have been reported that exceed the benchmark for automotive application of 6.5 wt% set by the U.S. Department of Energy. However, the experimental data obtained with different methods for various carbon nanostructures show an extreme scatter. Classical calculations based on physisorption of hydrogen molecules could not explain the high storage capacities measured at ambient temperature, and, assuming chemisorption of hydrogen atoms, hydrogen release requires temperatures too high for technical applications. Up to now, only a few calculations and experiments indicate the possibility of an intermediate binding energy. Recently, serious doubt has arisen in relation to several key experiments, causing considerable controversy. Furthermore, high hydrogen storage capacities measured for carbon nanofibers did not survive cross-checking in different laboratories.

There was a net flux of 372 Mt of CO2 in ASP I and 288 Mt of CO2 in ASP II, with an annual emission of 186 and 114 Mt of CO2 respectively.

In CLC the overall reaction by which chemical energy is released is between a hydrocarbon and air as in conventional combustors. However, the reaction is completed in two separate oxidation and reduction steps occurring in different reaction vessels. In the oxidizer (or air reactor) an oxygen carrier, usually a metal, is exothermically oxidized in air resulting in an oxide and a hot air stream (oxygen depleted). The exhaust gasses may be expanded through a turbine to produce work, while the oxide passes to the reduction vessel (or fuel reactor). Here, it reacts with the fuel, is reduced and the metal regenerated. The metal then returns to the oxidizer to complete the loop. The exhaust gasses from the reducer contain only carbon dioxide and water so that, after expansion and work extraction, the water may be condensed leaving a stream of pure CO2 ready for storage. Hydrocarbon fuels will continue to be used for decades, so, in the face of ambitious emission reduction targets, CCS is an important technology and methods, such as CLC, that offer automatic CO2 separation (so-called inherent carbon capture) are particularly attractive. Despite this obvious advantage CLC was not originally conceived for the purposes of CCS, but rather as a means to produce pure carbon dioxide free from contamination by inert gases such as nitrogen. In the context of power generation it was then proposed as a means to improve the exergetic efficiency of energy conversion processes using hydrocarbons. Combustion is usually a highly irreversible process and necessitates the rejection of large quantities of heat from power cycles leading to the low thermal efficiency of gas turbines and the like. The two-stage reaction approach of CLC can reduce the irreversibility and the extent of heat rejection and hence provide improved cycle efficiency. Ideally, both goals would be simultaneously achieved thereby offsetting both the cost of carbon capture and of compression, transportation and storage. In the paper we present a thermodynamic analysis of CLC to illustrate its potential for improving efficiency. We will then develop a methodology for selecting oxygen carriers based on their thermodynamic properties and review several candidate materials. In particular, we will compare, from a thermodynamic perspective, solid phase oxygen carriers as used in fluidised bed based reaction systems and the liquid/vapour phase carriers previously suggested by the authors. Finally, comments on practical implementations of CLC in power plant will be presented.Copyright \u00a9 2011 by ASME", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "3540603ccd6f9f6292702120467285effce994c6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2345839880", "CorpusId": 111917733}, "title": "Preliminary Assessment of Deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage in Nigeria", "abstract": null, "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "243c12f0de6ac03f7b44b163768a1a5c319ea260", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2366502583", "CorpusId": 148403662}, "title": "Learning from experts on public engagement with Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "68b645d096f13d808a007016acad4e07cf016857", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 199410430}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage ( CCS ) in 2100 : Price Estimate for ' Technological Learning", "abstract": null, "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "4753d2cd48e051abef695ae2bf954d8a535e5b14", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2740193350", "CorpusId": 133633536}, "title": "La tecnologia Carbon Capture and Storage: situazione attuale e prospettive future.", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "478f4b2bdb5eee59f05084e1be3bc2d18818ab7e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2583518991", "DOI": "10.2118/0716-0089-JPT", "CorpusId": 114864326}, "title": "A Portfolio of Commercial-Scale Carbon-Capture-and-Storage Demonstration Projects", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "66e93ab8dc240b69b5216f33c6548b7133c82c76", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3095054446", "CorpusId": 229221884}, "title": "A Study on the Carbon Capture and Storage under London Protocol", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "604b2ae67a9a0ceee6e479d9f5749356bb776c76", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2753027078", "CorpusId": 117431006}, "title": "Economic evaluation of carbon capture and storage enhanced oil recovery technology", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "49aad68fe9803e5dfd5c4cf2395fb089e9140e5b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2261584029", "CorpusId": 138019035}, "title": "The Major Technology Track and Analysis about Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "c4dbde4d429390c4f06c209011e245bc7f28d761", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3028338891", "CorpusId": 223770375}, "title": "Micrometeorological Technique for Monitoring of Geological Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage: Methodology, Workflow and Resources", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "42275e08c7f9ac477c0e44c0caf83598e829f5fd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2185567419", "CorpusId": 131133253}, "title": "BURYING CLIMATE CHANGE UNDERNEATH THE GROUND: A CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR NEW ZEALAND", "abstract": null, "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "c2aa8ee6e272fd248555ccfab435aabb30303fa3", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.5194/se-2019-45-supplement", "CorpusId": 243687103}, "title": "Supplementary material to \"Uncertainty in regional estimates of capacity for carbon capture and storage\"", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "63ccf9963a02b8403ce1499ceb0dc48285d29cfd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2604388592", "CorpusId": 113795393}, "title": "Energy experts discuss carbon capturing and storage techniques at AUS lecture", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "c2a6d7702728dcc475577189ec817fec00723098", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3009461597", "DOI": "10.18280/ti-ijes.640105", "CorpusId": 214610795}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Utilization: CO2 as an Asset?

Technical, economical, political and social issues related to CCUS are reviewed in this paper, together with an analysis of the main utilization strategies and ongoing projects in the world, and of the Italian situation.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "be984196988d87222e533b30ab7cd8cca03d01f6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3149086996", "DOI": "10.2139/SSRN.3818159", "CorpusId": 233554967}, "title": "Negative Emission Potentials in Industrial Sectors Due to Carbon Capture and Biomass", "abstract": "Industry, accounting for 24% of total global CO2 emissions, needs deep decarbonization in order to meet the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. Two important options for CO2 reduction are CO2 capture and storage (CCS) and biomass. CCS in industry has been broadly investigated, while biomass has seen limited attention. In addition, inconsistencies between studies makes comparing the performance of different mitigation options both within and across industrial subsectors difficult. Therefore, an integrated evaluation of the technical performance regarding CO2 capture and biomass using existing commercial technology was performed for five energy-intensive industrial sub-sectors. Harmonization results indicate that negative emissions can be reached in the steel, paper and H2 sub-sectors, while the cement and chemical sub-sectors can reduce their cradle-to-gate emissions by 92% and 68% respectively. The mitigation potential of the combination of CCS and biomass (BECCS) in the investigated sub-sectors could reach up to 13.7 Gt CO2 per year by 2050. Results also indicate that the current production routes used in the iron and steel sub-sector could be adjusted for CCS and/or biomass. Both the blast furnaces and the direct iron reduction mills can reduce their cradle-to-gate emissions by 107-108% when using BECCS with carbon-neutral electricity. This potential could increase to 177% when using more sustainable biomass. The work presented here is part of a larger ongoing analysis of CO2 mitigation potential and avoidance cost in industry.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "a49b9a5c5d686ee09fc81fa3365a6f822b7f9d26", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3113377037", "CorpusId": 231485595}, "title": "Techno-Economic Assessment of CO2 Transport for Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "45e78d043c515295d98a74da67a87df67845b9b8", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.46427/gold2020.3205", "CorpusId": 242552754}, "title": "Carbonation of Hydraulic Fracturing Flowback and Produced Water for Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "1ed53e42571ccb081635a0edebc4555b04d95014", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2548914538", "CorpusId": 114075062}, "title": "Impact of impurities on pipeline specification and hydraulics", "abstract": "The purity of the CO2 stream emitted from carbon capture plants is extremely important for the design and operation of CO2 pipelines, affecting, amongst other things, the hydraulic efficiency and potential operating range as well as having implications for the safety and integrity of the pipeline system. However, to date, there is still uncertainty regarding the range of impurities that could enter the transport and storage systems for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) schemes. The main difficulty in being able to specify a CO2 pipeline composition is that the type and levels of potential impurities in the CO2 stream will differ between power plants and industrial sources and also between the capture technologies installed at the sources. The problem is further compounded by the fact that, not only does each impurity cause different effects on the transportation system, these effects, for any individual component, can vary with conditions and can, for example, alter gaseous and dense phase pipeline operation in different ways. Additionally, the mixtures of impurities in CO2 streams leaving different capture processes could vary substantially, leading to dramatically different effects on compression, transport and storage operations. This paper investigates the effects of impurities on pipeline sizing for dense phase and gaseous phase pipeline transportation using a series of twelve CO2 impurity scenario compositions. The scenarios have been selected as worst-case compositions that are representative of plausible CO2 streams from different capture technologies and industry sources. Two analyses are presented: i) an initial hydraulic analysis, conducted for a single point-to-point pipeline transporting a fixed flow rate of CO2 in either the dense phase or gaseous phase and ii) a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effects of inlet pressure, ambient temperature and mass flow rate and pipeline size and identify an optimum pipeline size to handle each scenario in a hydraulically efficient manner. The inlet and outlet temperature and pressure ranges for each pipeline were selected based on a detailed analysis of the thermodynamic properties of the different streams, which is also discussed. As a result of the study, conclusions are drawn regarding the compositions that present the most challenge with respect to hydraulic efficiency and pipeline costs. In addition, guidance is provided on the specification of inlet conditions to improve the hydraulic performance of the pipeline. This work forms part of a study supported by IEAGHG on the \u201cImpact of CO2 Impurity on CO2 Compression, Liquefaction and Transportation\u201d. The study was commissioned to identify potential impurities and address the consequences of their impact on CO2 transportation.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "c2638ce5fd9b40e54f22960f5db3c74587bd2ad6", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 219681827}, "title": "The Herald: Aberdeen giant to work on key carbon capture and storage project", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "0192daff1ad76a427d71b912580c8f315f85cd23", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2598031170", "DOI": "10.4172/2157-7617.C1.025", "CorpusId": 116769295}, "title": "A systems apparoch to geo-engineering technologies: The case of carbon capture and storage CCS", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "69f90ea21495b383ced7159130052e464ac01328", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1016/j.ifacol.2021.08.309", "CorpusId": 237368610}, "title": "Optimising Carbon Capture and Storage Supply Chains for the European Industry", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "b5051ce0f398ace63dc3b9f47daab53d79133a17", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2727349891", "CorpusId": 134147333}, "title": "Is Carbon Capture and Storage the Answer for Heavy Oil*#63;", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "4524245f31fdaf82247b5f832e6909eae4b171af", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2283106418", "DOI": "10.11575/PRISM/34374", "CorpusId": 111927905}, "title": "Draft Australian Legislation on Carbon Capture and Storage: A Canadian Perspective", "abstract": null, "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "354964da543410391ed26e942661d0513a457eb8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1034244081", "CorpusId": 106793644}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage MMV - Lessons learned from Offshore Case Studies", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}]}
