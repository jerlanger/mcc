Our findings challenge common patterns: diffusion of FGD is not described by a single S-curve but by multiple steps and does not slow down after materiality. The regulation-driven diffusion of FGD can be fast, especially for retrofit since it does not require new power plants. Owing to the mature size of coal power plants, the diffusion of FGD is driven by unit numbers instead of unit capacity growth. We find that the diffusion of CCS in climate change mitigation pathways, when normalised for economic growth, rarely exceeds the historical maximum diffusion rate of FGD.

Currently, it is a mission for the whole world to control and reduce the emission of CO2. There is a great amount of CO2 being released from coal-fired power plants. Coal is expected to continue to be a prominent fuel for electricity production in the future (IEA, 2003; Thitalamol et al., 2007). CO2 mitigation options include energy efficiency improvements, the switch to less carbon-intensive fuels, nuclear power, renewable energy sources, enhancement of biological sinks, reduction of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions and CO2 capture and storage (CCS). CCS has the potential to reduce overall mitigation costs and increase flexibility in achieving greenhouse gas emission reductions. The widespread application of CCS would depend on technical maturity, costs, overall potential, diffusion and transfer of the technology to developing countries and their capacity to apply the technology, regulatory aspects, environmental issues and public perception (IPCC, 2005). In order to mitigate the CO2 emission from coal-fired power plants, there are three main methods of CCS technologies such as post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture and oxy-fuel combustion. Among them, the post-combustion method is the easiest method for the retrofitting of the current existing power plants.

Their use involves cyclic carbonation/calcination which results in a significant conversion reduction with increasing number of cycles. To reactivate spent CaO, vapor phase hydration is typically performed. However, little is known about the ultimate mechanism of such a hydration process. Here, we show that the vapor phase hydration of CaO formed after calcination of calcite (CaCO3) single crystals is a pseudomorphic, topotactic process, which progresses via an intermediate disordered phase prior to the final formation of oriented Ca(OH)2 nanocrystals. The strong structural control during this solid-state phase transition implies that the microstructural features of the CaO parent phase predetermine the final structural and physicochemical (reactivity and attrition) features of the product hydroxide. The higher molar volume of the product can create an impervious shell around unreacted CaO, thereby limiting the efficiency of the reactivation process. However, in the case of compact, sintered CaO structures, volume expansion cannot be accommodated in the reduced pore volume, and stress generation leads to pervasive cracking. This favors complete hydration but also detrimental attrition.

A discrete spatio-temporal description of the geographical region of Great Britain was used in addition to a detailed description of all network elements for illustrating the key factors in the design of nation-wide H2 and CO2 infrastructure. We have found that the synergistic deployment of H2 production technologies such as autothermal reforming of methane, and biomass gasification with CO2 abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) are critical in achieving cost-effective decarbonisation. We show that both large scale underground H2 storage and water electrolysis provide resilience and flexibility to the heating system, competing on cost and deployment rates. The optimal regions for siting H2 production infrastructure are characterised by proximity to: (1) underground H2 storage, (2) high demands for H2, (3) geological storage for CO2. Furthermore, cost-effective transitions based on a methane reforming pathway may necessitate regional expansions in the supply of natural gas with profound implications for security of supply in nations that are already highly reliant, potentially creating an infrastructure lock-in during the near term. We found that the total system cost, comprising both investment and operational elements, is mostly influenced by the natural gas price, followed by biomass price and CapEx of underground caverns.

Those modelling studies that incorporate varying degrees of geological realism show the inherent risks and uncertainties that can result from neglecting heterogeneity and reservoir\u2013caprock topography along the migration path of an injected CO2 plume. A key problem is that detailed geological data are often not available for the relatively deep saline aquifers that are an important target for CCS. Deep saline aquifers fall between the relatively data-rich environments of shallow freshwater aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs and it is in these settings that outcrop analogues may play an important part in reducing the risks and uncertainties associated with CCS. This study uses an example from the Sherwood Sandstone Group (Otter Sandstone Formation) of the Wessex Basin to show how an outcrop study can impart a much greater understanding of heterogeneity in critical reservoir\u2013caprock zones.

Hence, the last decade has seen a huge increase in research related to CCSU (carbon capture storage and utilization). The International Conference on Carbon Dioxide Utilization (ICCDU) provides a vibrant multi-disciplinary discussion forum for leading academics, researchers, and practitioners to showcase their recent innovations in the capture, concentration, storage, utilization, and conversion of carbon dioxide. The first edition (ICCDU-1991) of this biennial conference series took place in Japan. Since then, it has been held at various venues in Europe, Asia, and America. The one and only Singapore hosted the 13th edition (ICCDU XIII or ICCDU-2015) during July 5\u20139, 2015. The theme of ICCDU-2015 was materials, processes, and systems related to CCSU. ICCDU-2015 featured several plenary and keynote lectures by eminent speakers (including a Nobel Laureate) from around the world and a panel discussion involving academic, industry, and policy leaders from all continents. Attended by 340 delegates from 34 countries, ICCDU-2015 involved 330 oral and/or poster presentations. After a successful conference, we invited the delegates to submit fulllength manuscripts related to their conference presentations. The manuscripts were submitted for peer reviews to four special issues on ICCDU-2015 in Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, Catalysis Today, Journal of CO2 Utilization, and Environmental Science and Pollution Research. This special issue features nine scientific contributions that present technoeconomic perspectives on and/or sustainability analyses of various conversion alternatives, process designs, and innovative materials related to CCSU. The issue begins with a broad supply chain perspective on CCSU. It then compares alternative processes and technologies for high-temperature capture, dry reforming, biofixation, biocatalysis, and mineralization. In contrast to the other eight articles that evaluate specific processes and technologies, Naims (Naims 2016) analyzes the supply and demand of CO2 as a feedstock. She reviews the industrial sources of CO2 emissions, their benchmark capture costs, and potential S/U alternatives to predict the roles and relative importance of various CO2 supply sources for the near-term (<10 years) and long-term (>10 years) scenarios.

The EU has a legal obligation to meet its Kyoto Protocol commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in Europe by 20% by 2020 compared to 1990 levels. The EU Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is the key instrument in Europe for controlling and reducing GHG emissions. CCS will be included in the EU ETS from Phase 3 onwards (2013) which, along with other mechanisms, will provide industry with the much needed financial incentives for introducing CCS. Under the Scheme, any captured and permanently stored CO2 will not be considered as emitted. This will introduce substantial savings in both the purchase and trading of CO2. Without CCS, the UK Government estimates that UK industry will spend approximately \u00a38 billion by 2020 on the purchase of EU ETS allowances (EUAs). Measurement and monitoring will be a key element of the CCS regulatory framework, as reflected in the European CCS Directive, which calls for flow measurement, composition measurement and CO2 leak detection across the full CCS chain. As a new technology, sound measurement and monitoring will be essential in demonstrating the safety of CCS. This will be essential to stakeholders, including the public. As well as environmental and safety needs, accurate measurement will also be fundamental in reducing financial exposure in CO2 trading schemes. To this end, the EU ETS Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines set stringent measurement and monitoring criteria. The capture of CO2 emissions from large industrial sources is a new concept and has yet to be proven large-scale, as are the transportation of CO2 by pipeline or ship, and the permanent storage of CO2 in geological formations. All these areas have to be addressed to allow commercialisation of CCS. The majority of CCS research so far has focused primarily on the CO2 capture technologies and the geological surveying and monitoring of storage sites. As custodian of the UK\u2019s National Flow Measurement Standards, TUV NEL has identified a need to establish suitable and accurate methods for flow measurement of CO2 in CCS applications, particularly in view of the issues and challenges arising from the unique behaviour of CO2 under different property states and process conditions. To put the importance of accurate flow measurement into perspective, consider the UK\u2019s largest emitting power station. This emits approximately 22 million tonnes of CO2 per annum.

Growing native species on unfarmed land is a promising way forward. Science, this issue p. eaal2324 BACKGROUND Cellulosic biofuels offer environmental benefits not available from grain-based biofuels and are a cornerstone of efforts to meet transportation fuel needs in a future low-carbon economy, even with electrified vehicles and other advances. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is also key to almost all Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change mitigation scenarios that constrain end-of-century atmospheric CO2 to 450 parts per million. Some cellulosic feedstocks can come from industrial and agricultural by-products or from winter cover crops, but a substantial fraction must come from cellulosic biomass crops\u2014perennial grasses and short-rotation trees planted for this purpose. Land requirements, however, are substantial and raise crucial questions about the environmental sustainability of a future bioenergy economy. First, if planted on existing croplands, will biofuel crops increase food prices or lead to the establishment of new cropland elsewhere, with concomitant climate harm? Second, will planting biofuel crops diminish biodiversity, especially if non-native or invasive species are cultivated on land with existing conservation value? Third, might perennial biofuel crops use more water than the vegetation they replace, leading to lower water tables and reduced surface water flows? And finally, if crops are fertilized, how much additional reactive nitrogen might be added to a biosphere already overburdened? ADVANCES Recent empirical findings have shed considerable light on these questions. Broad generalizations are difficult, but we know now, for example, that planting perennial cellulosic biofuel crops on marginal lands\u2014that is, land not currently used for food production because of low fertility, environmental sensitivity, or other reasons\u2014can potentially avoid food-fuel conflict and indirect land-use change effects while providing substantial climate benefits. The direct carbon costs of establishing crops on such lands can be minimized by avoiding tillage and by avoiding land with large existing carbon stocks, such as forests and wetlands. Diverse plantings provide multiple ecosystem services including wildlife conservation, pollination, and pest protection that can benefit neighboring crops; relatively little plant diversity can provide disproportionately large benefits. Biofuel crops can be planted that require little if any nitrogen fertilizer, thus avoiding its environmental impact. And although different crops have different water-use efficiencies, most crops examined appear to evapotranspire about the same proportion of growing season rainfall, suggesting little impact on landscape water balances in humid temperate regions. It is also clear that there is no best crop for all locations even within a single region, and that all choices involve trade-offs. For example, highly productive non-native species can maximize climate benefits but harm biodiversity. Balancing trade-offs entails societal choices. OUTLOOK Many questions about cellulosic biofuel sustainability remain. Still needed is an integrated understanding of the entire field-to-product enterprise sufficient to leverage synergies and to avoid trade-offs that can diminish environmental benefits. More specifically, and of particular importance, is the need for knowledge to facilitate the successful cultivation of highly productive native species on marginal lands, where plant growth is often limited by abiotic stressors. Harnessing the plant microbiome to help ameliorate environmental stress is a major untapped frontier, as is the potential for microbiome-assisted soil carbon gain. The promise of cellulosic biofuels for helping to create a more sustainable energy future is bright, but additional effort is required, including policies and incentives to motivate farmers to grow appropriate crops in appropriate places in sustainable ways. We must be careful to facilitate genuine climate mitigation that enhances rather than diminishes other ecosystem services. The planet deserves no less.

PHOTO: K. STEPNITZ, MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY Cellulosic crops are projected to provide a large fraction of transportation energy needs by mid-century. However, the anticipated land requirements are substantial, which creates a potential for environmental harm if trade-offs are not sufficiently well understood to create appropriately prescriptive policy. Recent empirical findings show that cellulosic bioenergy concerns related to climate mitigation, biodiversity, reactive nitrogen loss, and crop water use can be addressed with appropriate crop, placement, and management choices.

This study reviews the geochemical processes related to the intrusion of CO2 into near-surface environments with an emphasis on metal mobilization and discusses about the geochemical research approaches, recent findings, and current knowledge gaps. It is found that the intrusion of CO2(g) into near-surface likely induces changes in pH, dissolution of minerals, and potential degradation of surrounding environments. The development of adequate geochemical research approaches for assessing CO2 leakage in near-surface environments, using field studies, laboratory experiments, and/or geochemical modeling combined with isotopic tracers, has promoted extensive surveys of CO2-induced reactions. However, addressing knowledge gaps in geochemical changes in near-surface environments is fundamental to advance current knowledge on how CO2 leaks from storage sites and the consequences of this process on soil and water chemistry. For reliable detection and risk management of the potential impact of CO2 leakage from storage sites on the environmental chemistry, currently available geochemical research approaches should be either combined or used independently (albeit in a manner complementarily to one another), and the results should be jointly interpreted.Graphical abstract", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "32cd9fdc8a8e90d12af515122b04aa3752108d0e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1137981846", "DOI": "10.1016/J.JCT.2015.08.005", "CorpusId": 93547758}, "title": "High pressures phase equilibria of (carbon dioxide + 1-undecanol) system and their potential role in carbon capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "8c04e43e3c7362ea44614b2d8f5dc768116e56ec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3150526732", "DOI": "10.3390/SU13074026", "CorpusId": 233561605}, "title": "A New Perspective for Climate Change Mitigation\u2014Introducing Carbon-Negative Hydrogen Production from Biomass with Carbon Capture and Storage (HyBECCS)", "abstract": "The greatest lever for advancing climate adaptation and mitigation is the defossilization of energy systems. A key opportunity to replace fossil fuels across sectors is the use of renewable hydrogen. In this context, the main political and social push is currently on climate neutral hydrogen (H2) production through electrolysis using renewable electricity. Another climate neutral possibility that has recently gained importance is biohydrogen production from biogenic residual and waste materials. This paper introduces for the first time a novel concept for the production of hydrogen with net negative emissions. The derived concept combines biohydrogen production using biotechnological or thermochemical processes with carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage. Various process combinations referred to this basic approach are defined as HyBECCS (Hydrogen Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) and described in this paper. The technical principles and resulting advantages of the novel concept are systematically derived and compared with other Negative Emission Technologies (NET). These include the high concentration and purity of the CO2 to be captured compared to Direct Air Carbon Capture (DAC) and Post-combustion Carbon Capture (PCC) as well as the emission-free use of hydrogen resulting in a higher possible CO2 capture rate compared to hydrocarbon-based biofuels generated with Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technologies. Further, the role of carbon-negative hydrogen in future energy systems is analyzed, taking into account key societal and technological drivers against the background of climate adaptation and mitigation.

Herein, we hypothesized that CA immobilization onto flexible and hydrated \"bridges\" that ensure proton-transfer at their interfaces leads to improved activity and kinetic behavior and potentially increases enzyme's feasibility for industrial implementation. Our hypothesis was formulated considering that water plays a key role in the CO2 hydration process and acts as both the reactant as well as the rate-limiting step of the CO2 capture and transformation process. To demonstrate our hypothesis, two types of user-synthesized organic metallic frameworks [metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), one hydrophilic and one hydrophobic] were considered as model supports and their surface characteristics (i.e., charge, shape, curvature, size, etc.) and influence on the immobilized enzyme's behavior were evaluated. Morphology, crystallinity and particle size, and surface area of the model supports were determined by scanning electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements, respectively. Enzyme activity, kinetics, and stability at the supports interfaces were determined using spectroscopical analyses. Analysis showed that enzyme functionality is dependent on the support used in the immobilization process, with the enzyme immobilized onto the hydrophilic support retaining 72% activity of the free CA, when compared with that immobilized onto the hydrophobic one that only retained about 28% activity. Both CA-MOF conjugates showed good storage stability relative to the free enzyme in solution, with CA immobilized at the hydrophilic support also revealing increased thermal stability and retention of almost all original enzyme activity even after heating treatment at 70 \u00b0C. In contrast, free CA lost almost half of its original activity when subject to the same conditions.

While efforts are made to reduce the release of greenhouse gases via reduced energy consumption, more efficient energy production, and a shift to renewable energy supplies, it is generally expected that fossil fuels will continue to provide a major part of the world\u2019s energy portfolio during the 21 st century (IPCC 2005). This is particularly true for coal which is relatively inexpensive and abundantly available in existing or emerging industrial power houses such as the United States, Brazil, Russia, India, and China. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has been developed as an interim measure to allow energy production from coal without CO 2 emissions. This currently available technology entails capturing CO 2 from large-scale industrial sources such as coal-fired power plants or cement, steel and petrochemical factories. The captured CO 2 gas is then compressed to a smaller volume, hence higher density, transported in pipelines, and eventually injected for long-term storage into deep geologic formations, such as deep saltwater-bearing aquifers or depleted oil and gas fields (IPCC 2005). Extensive research is currently carried out to (1) improve the technology and efficiency of capturing CO 2 and (2) to ensure the long-term safety of storing CO 2 underground.

es er ve d. Abstract Meeting climate and energy goals requires a fundamental and accelerated transformation of power systems globally. Decision makers collectively must support a rapid shift to low-carbon generation while meeting strong growth in power demand, driven by increased energy access in developing economies and electrification of end-use sectors. Carbon capture, utilisation and storage (or \u201cCCUS\u201d) technologies can play an important role in this transformation in three ways: First, retrofitting carbon capture technologies is an important solution to avoid the \u201clock-in\u201d of emissions from the vast fleet of existing fossil-fuelled power plants while also providing plant owners with an asset protection strategy for recent investments. This is of particular relevance in Asia, where the average age of coal-fired power plants is just 12 years. Second, increasing variable renewable generation requires dispatchable energy for flexibility and resource adequacy. Batteries and other forms of energy storage are being further developed and deployed, but carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies are also part of the portfolio of low-carbon technologies able to meet the growing need for flexibility (to manage both short-term and seasonal variations). These strategies offer a technological hedge against innovation uncertainty in the power system transformation. Third, through its combination with bioenergy, carbon capture technologies can enable negative-emission power plants, which may be critical for offsetting emissions in harder-to-abate sectors and to support \u201cnet-zero\u201d climate goals. Today, only two large-scale CCUS facilities are operating in the power sector. But experience from these first-of-a-kind plants highlights the potential to reduce costs significantly and improve technology with further research, development and deployment. Policy makers are urged to provide targeted policy support, including capital grants, public procurement and tax credits, to kick-start near-term investment in CCUS-equipped power plants. The role of CCUS in low-carbon power systems Highlights 5 IE .A ll rig ht s es er ve d. Highlights \uf09f Carbon capture, utilisation and storage technologies have important roles to play in decarbonising global power systems, which today are dominated by fossil fuels, and in supporting the transition to net-zero emissions. \uf09f Owners of existing plants as well as those under construction can retrofit carbon capture technologies to protect their assets and avoid the potential \u201clock in\u201d of emissions, in particular in Asia with a large and relatively young fleet of existing fossil-fuelled plants. \uf09f System operators can benefit from CCUS-equipped power plants, which help integrate growing shares of renewables into the power system by providing shortand long-term flexibility. \uf09f Combining these technologies with bioenergy enables negative-emission power plants that can offset emissions in harder-to-abate sectors and support \u201cnet-zero\u201d climate goals. \uf09f Significant cost reductions and technology improvements have already been achieved for these technologies, with further improvements anticipated through research, development and deployment. \uf09f Targeted policy measures, like the 45Q and 48A tax credits in the United States, will be critical to realise the potential of carbon capture technologies in power generation. The role of CCUS in low-carbon power systems Actions for policy makers 6 IE .A ll rig ht s es er ve d. Actions for policy makers Policy makers can accelerate the low-carbon transition by supporting policies that promote carbon capture technologies in power generation Carbon capture, utilisation and storage, one element in an array of technologies enabling countries to achieve the Paris Agreement goals, has an important role to play in the least-cost transformation of power generation systems for a low-carbon future. However, its deployment will rely on policy makers taking action to give direction to utilities and investors. Policy actions will need to take into account local and regional power market characteristics and the anticipated role of CCUS-equipped plants in the market, which may evolve over time as flexibility requirements increase. The availability of CO2 transport and storage infrastructure or demand for CO2 from users will be critical to underpin investment in CO2 capture facilities at power plants. Policy makers are likely to need a range of approaches to support successful business cases and accelerate deployment of carbon capture technologies in power generation, including: \uf09f ", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "5fa084834db35f07a66bc3888551fe3fb22c864a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2313844948", "DOI": "10.1021/IE502110Q", "CorpusId": 102282634}, "title": "Conceptual Process Design of CO2 Recovery Plants for Enhanced Oil Recovery Applications", "abstract": "Processes for recovering CO2 (carbon dioxide) from CO2-rich gas are important in the CO2 EOR (enhanced oil recovery) field.

To make this process even more environmentally friendly, the fraction of CO2 which exits (is produced from) the oil well can be captured and recycled for reinjection giving a more efficient CO2 storage strategy. The mixture of gases produced from an oil well contains light hydrocarbons, heavy hydrocarbons, water, and CO2.

CCS entails capture of CO2 from combustion products from industrial plants and subsequent storage of this CO2 in geological formations or reservoirs. Some NETs, such as bioenergy with CCS and direct air capture, also require such CO2 sinks. For these technologies to work, it is essential to identify and use only secure geological reservoirs with minimal risk of leakage over a timescale of multiple centuries. Prediction of storage integrity is thus a difficult but critical task. Natural analogues or naturally occurring deposits of CO2, can provide some information on which geological features (e.g., depth, temperature, and pressure) are predictive of secure or insecure storage. In this work, a rough set-based machine learning (RSML) technique is used to analyze data from more than 70 secure and insecure natural CO2 reservoirs. RSML is then used to generate empirical rule-based predictive models for selection of suitable CO2 storage sites.

In this regard, electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) powered by renewable electricity provides an attractive approach because it not only converts CO2 to valuable fuels and chemicals but also offers a solution for the long-term storage of intermittent renewable energies.

Specifically, the north-eastern state of Assam in India is home to large point sources of CO2 emissions like power, chemical or fertilizer plants, and has abundant sinks in the form of mature oil fields, coal beds, and saline aquifers.

We analyze how the levelized cost of electricity will change across three power plants, and how the economics of capture and avoidance costs at a chemical plant can revive its current financial situation, to present why there is an incentive for CCUS in Assam. The results show that for any CCUS implementation plant design, age and preparedness are factors that influence the economics and can lead to huge differentials.

Such reliance on BECCS implies IAMs assign it a high value. Past analyses on the value of BECCS in IAMs have not explicitly addressed the role of model structure and assumptions as value drivers. This paper examines the extent to which the value of BECCS in IAMs is enhanced by model structure constraints and assumptions. Predominant use of high discount rates (3.5\u20135%) means models opt for delayed-action strategies for emissions mitigation that lead to high levels of cumulative net-negative emissions, while lower discount rates lead to reduce reliance on NETs. Until recently in the literature, most models limited NET options to only BECCS and afforestation, but introduction of other CDR options can reduce BECCS deployment. Constraints on grid penetration of variable renewable energy (VRE) is a determining factor on the level of BECCS deployment across models, and more constrained grid penetration of VREs leads to more BECCS in electricity generation. This paper concludes BECCS derives significant value not only from the existing structure of IAMs but also from what is not represented in models and by predominant use of high discount rates. Omissions include NETs other than BECCS and deforestation, low-carbon innovation in end-use technologies, grid resilience to intermittent sources, and energy use in agriculture production. As IAMs increasingly endogenize such constraints, the value of BECCS in resulting scenarios is likely to be dampened.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "536c3d205b9417147ec535dd080c62399aeb2634", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2981908993", "DOI": "10.1002/adma.201904524", "CorpusId": 204883830, "PubMed": "31650656"}, "title": "High\u2010Energy Efficiency Membraneless Flowless Zn\u2013Br Battery: Utilizing the Electrochemical\u2013Chemical Growth of Polybromides", "abstract": "Aqueous Zn\u2013Br batteries (ZBBs) offer promising next\u2010generation high\u2010density energy storage for energy storage systems, along with distinctive cost effectiveness particularly in membraneless and flowless (MLFL) form.

Variables included conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) and four rates of N fertilizer. Selected soil quality indicators included soil organic carbon (SOC), bulk density (BD), wet aggregate stability (WAS), and ponded infiltration. No-till accumulated more SOC in the surface 0 to 5 cm, and was less dense at all depths than CT. When tillage was compared across all N rates, NT contained 30% greater SOC than CT at the 0 to 5 cm. Mean weight diameter (MWD) was larger with increasing N fertilization and eliminating tillage. Ponded infiltration rates were greatest for the high N fertilization rate under NT, and lowest for the 0 kg N ha\u22121 rate under CT.

In a CCS project, mechanical integrity of well cement should be maintained to sustain the required mechanical strength throughout the life of an oil/gas and CO2 sequestration well. One of the major issues with existing Portland cement based oil well cement is cement degradation in CO2-rich environment. On the other hand, geopolymer cement possesses excellent acid resistant characteristics, shows higher mechanical strength and durability and demonstrates lower permeability. Therefore, this research work focused on studying the mechanical integrity of geopolymers under two different down-hole conditions: (1) effect of CO2 on mechanical behaviour of geopolymers and (2) hydraulic fracturing of geopolymers to study the mechanical integrity under down-hole stress conditions. To study the mechanical integrity under CO2 rich environment, geopolymers were tested in CO2 chamber at a pressure of 3\u00a0MPa for up to 6\u00a0months and compressive strength and microstructural testings were conducted. It was noted that strength values of geopolymers did not change significantly in CO2 environment for 6\u00a0months. There were only about 2\u00a0% variations in compressive strength values in CO2 compared to the initial strength value. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) test results revealed that there is no significance variation in the microstructure of geopolymer after 6\u00a0months in CO2. For hydraulic fracturing experiment, four different tests were conducted with various injection pressure (Pin), axial stress (\u03c31), confining pressure (\u03c33) and tube length (30 and 40\u00a0mm). Geopolymers could not be fractured in any of the four tests, in which maximum values of Pin of 23\u00a0MPa and \u03c31 of 59\u00a0MPa were used. There was no fracture development in geopolymers despite maximum ratios of Pin/\u03c33 of 3.8 and \u03c31/\u03c33 of 13.3 was tested. Tests could not be repeated with higher ratios of Pin/\u03c33 and \u03c31/\u03c33 due to the limitation with the triaxial set-up used.

In efforts to develop better MOFs for gas storage and separation, a number of strategies including creation of open metal sites and implantation of Lewis base sites have been used to tune host-guest interactions. In addition to these chemical factors, the geometric features such as pore size and shape, surface area, and pore volume also play important roles in sorption energetics and uptake capacity. For efficient capture of small gas molecules such as carbon dioxide under ambient conditions, large surface area or high pore volume are often not needed. Instead, maximizing host-guest interactions or the density of binding sites by encaging gas molecules in snug pockets of pore space can be a fruitful approach. To put this concept into practice, the pore space partition (PSP) concept has been proposed and has achieved a great experimental success. In this account, we will highlight many efforts to implement PSP in MOFs and impact of PSP on gas uptake performance. In the synthetic design of PSP, it is helpful to distinguish between factors that contribute to the framework formation and factors that serve the purpose of PSP. Because of the need for complementary structural roles, the synthesis of MOFs with PSP often involves multicomponent systems including mixed ligands, mixed inorganic nodes, or both. It is possible to accomplish both framework formation and PSP with a single type of polyfunctional ligands that use some functional groups (called framework-forming group) for framework formation and the remaining functional groups (called pore-partition group) for PSP. Alternatively, framework formation and PSP can be shouldered by different chemical species. For example, in a mixed-ligand system, one ligand (called framework-forming agent) can play the role of the framework formation while the other type of ligand (called pore-partition agent) can assume the role of PSP. PSP is sensitive to the types of inorganic secondary building units (SBUs). The coexistence of SBUs complementary in charge, connectivity, and so on can promote PSP. The use of heterometallic systems can promote the diversity of SBUs coexistent under a given condition. Heterometallic system with metal ions of different oxidation states also provides the charge tunability of SBUs and the overall framework, providing an additional level of control in self-assembly and ultimately in the materials' properties.

The Ecosystem Demography model version 2.2 (ED-2.2) is a terrestrial biosphere model that simulates the biophysical, ecological, and biogeochemical dynamics of vertically and horizontally heterogeneous terrestrial ecosystems. In a companion paper (Longo et\u00a0al.,\u00a02019a), we described how the model solves the energy, water, and carbon cycles, and verified the high degree of conservation of these properties in long-term simulations that include long-term (multi-decadal) vegetation dynamics. Here, we present a detailed assessment of the model's ability to represent multiple processes associated with the biophysical and biogeochemical cycles in Amazon forests. We use multiple measurements from eddy covariance towers, forest inventory plots, and regional remote-sensing products to assess the model's ability to represent biophysical, physiological, and ecological processes at multiple timescales, ranging from subdaily to century long. The ED-2.2 model accurately describes the vertical distribution of light, water fluxes, and the storage of water, energy, and carbon in the canopy air space, the regional distribution of biomass in tropical South America, and the variability of biomass as a function of environmental drivers. In addition, ED-2.2 qualitatively captures several emergent properties of the ecosystem found in observations, specifically observed relationships between aboveground biomass, mortality rates, and wood density; however, the slopes of these relationships were not accurately captured.

The concept could be adapted for production of H2 as well, which would provide a carbon free energy carrier that could be used for example as transportation fuel. In this doctoral thesis, the option to use chemical-looping technologies to produce H2 from fossil fuels with CO2 capture is explored.\nIn chemical-looping combustion, direct contact between fuel and combustion air is avoided. Instead, a solid oxygen carrier performs the task of bringing oxygen from the air to the fuel. Thus, the resulting CO2 and H2O are not diluted with N2, and pure CO2 can easily be recovered by cooling and condensation. The heat of reaction is the same as for ordinary combustion. Chemical-looping reforming uses the same basic principles as chemical-looping combustion, but operates at understoichiometric conditions. Therefore chemical-looping reforming can be said to be a process for partial oxidation of hydrocarbon fuel into H2 and CO, where chemical looping is used as a source of undiluted oxygen.\nIn the theoretical part of this work, the technical feasibility to use chemical-looping technologies for production of H2 with CO2 capture has been examined. Two main ideas have been explored. Steam reforming integrated with chemical-looping combustion means that chemical-looping combustion is used for CO2 capture and as heat source for generation of H2 via the endothermic steam reforming reaction. Chemical-looping autothermal reforming utilizes understoichiometric conditions and the possibility to add some H2O to the fuel, in order to have both partial oxidation and steam reforming reactions occurring in the same reactor vessel. This way, a thermo neutral process is obtained. It is found that both options have potential to provide substantial advantages compared to conventional technologies. Thermodynamic modelling shows that reformer efficiencies of 80% or higher, including CO2 capture and CO2 compression, seem to be obtainable with both processes.\nIn the experimental part, chemical-looping reforming and chemical-looping combustion has been demonstrated in two different circulating-fluidized bed reactors. In total, over 200 hours of experiments have been recorded. Natural gas was used as fuel, and four different NiO-based materials have been used as oxygen carrier. Process conditions have varied from almost complete combustion into CO2 and H2O, to almost stoichiometric partial oxidation into CO and H2. The reactor temperature has been between 800 and 950oC. The experiments worked very well, but occasionally limited formation of solid carbon could occur in the reactor. Adding 25-30% H2O or CO2 to the natural gas reduced this tendency significantly.\nIn addition to this, a few unconventional materials that could be used as oxygen carrier in chemical-looping applications have been examined by reduction with CH4 in a fixed-bed reactor at 900oC. Some potentially useful materials were identified, such as Lax Sr1-xFeO3\u2500\u03b4 perovskites and mixtures of Fe2O3 and NiO supported on MgAl2O4.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "d8d6a5d3ee58925e449c73af5a20e867aa45d99e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2950631924", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/AB2B4B", "CorpusId": 197824186}, "title": "Freshwater requirements of large-scale bioenergy plantations for limiting global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C", "abstract": "Limitingmean global warming towell below 2 \u00b0Cwill probably require substantial negative emissions (NEs)within the 21st century.

Irrigation of these plantationsmight be necessary to increase the yield, which is likely to put further pressure on already stressed freshwater systems. Conversely, the potential of bioenergy plantations (BPs) dedicated to achievingNEs throughCO2 assimilationmay be limited in regions with low freshwater availability. This paper provides a first-order quantification of the biophysical potentials of BECCS as a negative emission technology contribution to reaching the 1.5 \u00b0Cwarming target, as constrained by associated water availabilities and requirements.

Both scenarios suggest that achieving a 50% emissions reduction target (relative to 1990 levels) by 2050 is technically feasible if locally suited technologies are introduced and the relevant policies, including necessary financial transfers, are appropriately implemented. In the scenario that includes nuclear and CCS options, it will be vital to consider the risks and acceptance of these technologies. In the scenario without these technologies, the challenge will be how to reduce energy service demand. In both scenarios, the estimated investment costs will be higher in non-Annex I countries than in Annex I countries. Finally, the enhancement of capacity building to support the deployment of locally suited technologies will be central to achieving an LCS. Policy relevance Policies to reduce GHG emissions up to 2050 are critical if the long-term target of stabilizing the climate is to be achieved. From a policy perspective, the cost and social acceptability of the policy used to reduce emissions are two of the key factors in determining the optimal pathways to achieve this. However, the nuclear accident at Fukushima highlighted the risk of depending on large-scale technologies for the provision of energy and has led to a backlash against the use of nuclear technology. It is found that if nuclear and CCS are used it will be technically feasible to halve GHG emissions by 2050, although very costly. However, although the cost of halving emissions will be about the same if neither nuclear nor CCS is used, a 50% reduction in emissions reduction will not be achievable unless the demand for energy service is substantially reduced.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "f3860ca6097fff8047b6664e649ab2c8d5de246c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2094583675", "DOI": "10.1007/s10853-015-8871-x", "CorpusId": 137395588}, "title": "Ammonia borane confined by poly(methyl methacrylate)/multiwall carbon nanotube nanofiber composite, as a polymeric hydrogen storage material", "abstract": "In this work, poly(methyl methacrylate)/ammonia borane/multiwall carbon nanotube (PMMA/AB/MWCNT) nanofiber composites have been fabricated and the synergetic nanoconfinement effect of nanofiber and CNT components on dehydrogenation temperature and liberating unwanted byproducts of AB (NH3BH3) have been studied.

With the likely application of CO 2 capture technologies to coal combustion flue gases, corrosion rates in gas streams containing oxygen are of interest and evaluation of potential construction materials under realistic conditions is essential. A total of 128 corrosion coupons were installed at the Tarong Post Combustion Capture (PCC) pilot plant in 8 locations during operation with 30 wt% monoethanolamine (MEA). Each corrosion test location contained 4 coupons of each type of metal (316L, 316L welded, C1018, C1018 galvanized). Coupons were installed in the pilot plant for 4296 or 5448 h; however plant operation was intermittent with actual operating times of 593 or 745 h. The highest corrosion rates were observed for carbon steel (C1018) and galvanized carbon steel (C1018 GLV) coupons located in both the absorber and stripper solvent storage tanks. C1018 GLV coupons typically showed higher rates of corrosion than C1018 coupons. C1018 coupons located in the absorber wash section also exhibited high corrosion rates, while C1018 GLV coupons in the same location did not. XRD analysis showed that the galvanized coupons in the absorber wash section retained some Zn in the corrosion scale. This could have aided their resistance to corrosion in this location. All other galvanized samples lost their zinc coating, indicating galvanizing might not be appropriate for use in CO 2 capture applications. C1018 coupons in the absorber column experienced pitting. This was not seen for the galvanized coupons. In the stripping column, both the C1018 and C1018 GLV coupons showed areas of general corrosion attack. Stainless steel and welded stainless steel coupons showed no appreciable corrosion weight loss under the conditions tested. The corrosion resistance of the 316L stainless steel coupons to all environments considered here suggests it is suitable for use in all areas of amine based PCC plants. The corrosion rates measured on C1018 and C1018 GLV coupons suggest these materials would not be recommended for use in solvent storage tanks or wash sections of PCC plants. Due to intermittent use of the plant, it is unclear from these results whether C1018 or C1018 GLV would be suitable for use in the absorption/desorption columns. \u00a9 2013 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "f012537b246727b25ccfa0595311846b1a151cff", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/cce/ZhangZLZD20", "MAG": "3022976337", "DOI": "10.1016/j.compchemeng.2020.106885", "CorpusId": 219034823}, "title": "Optimization-based approach for CO2 utilization in carbon capture, utilization and storage supply chain", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "935a91cf019da19b73578ecc461ca6de05c49033", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2087797566", "DOI": "10.1115/1.4000122", "CorpusId": 110676048}, "title": "Combined Cycles With CO2 Capture: Two Alternatives for System Integration", "abstract": "As carbon capture and storage technology has grown as a promising option to significantly reduce CO2 emissions, system integration and optimization claim an important and crucial role. This paper presents a comparative study of a gas turbine cycle with postcombustion CO2 separation using an amine-based absorption process with monoethanolamine. The study has been made for a triple pressure reheated 400 MWe natural gas-fuelled combined cycle with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to improve capture efficiency. Two different options for the energy supply to the solvent regeneration have been evaluated and compared concerning plant performance. In the first alternative heat is provided by steam extracted internally from the bottoming steam cycle, while in the second option an external biomass-fuelled boiler was utilized to generate the required heat. With this novel configuration the amount of CO2 captured can be even more than 100% if the exhaust gas from the biofuelled boiler is mixed and cleaned together with the main exhaust gas flow from the combined cycle. In order to make an unprejudiced comparison between the two alternatives, the reduced steam turbine efficiency has been taken into consideration and estimated, for the alternative with internal steam extraction. The cycles have been modeled in the commercial heat and mass balance program IPSEPRO \u2122 using detailed component models. Utilizing EGR can double the CO2 content of the exhaust gases and reduce the energy need for the separation process by approximately 2% points. Using an external biomass-fuelled boiler as heat source for amine regeneration turns out to be an interesting option due to high CO2 capture effectiveness. However the electrical efficiency of the power plant is reduced compared with the option with internal steam extraction. Another drawback with the external boiler is the higher investment costs but nevertheless, it is flexibility due to the independency from the rest of the power generation system represents a major operational advantage.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "f8df268dfa7636309b29125735249bb20a6a0c52", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2062006538", "PubMedCentral": "3840024", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0080286", "CorpusId": 14665336, "PubMed": "24282532"}, "title": "An Integrated Model of Environmental Effects on Growth, Carbohydrate Balance, and Mortality of Pinus ponderosa Forests in the Southern Rocky Mountains", "abstract": "Climate-induced tree mortality is an increasing concern for forest managers around the world. We used a coupled hydrologic and ecosystem carbon cycling model to assess temperature and precipitation impacts on productivity and survival of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Model predictions were evaluated using observations of productivity and survival for three ponderosa pine stands located across an 800 m elevation gradient in the southern Rocky Mountains, USA, during a 10-year period that ended in a severe drought and extensive tree mortality at the lowest elevation site. We demonstrate the utility of a relatively simple representation of declines in non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) as an approach for estimating patterns of ponderosa pine vulnerability to drought and the likelihood of survival along an elevation gradient. We assess the sensitivity of simulated net primary production, NSC storage dynamics, and mortality to site climate and soil characteristics as well as uncertainty in the allocation of carbon to the NSC pool. For a fairly wide set of assumptions, the model estimates captured elevational gradients and temporal patterns in growth and biomass. Model results that best predict mortality risk also yield productivity, leaf area, and biomass estimates that are qualitatively consistent with observations across the sites. Using this constrained set of parameters, we found that productivity and likelihood of survival were equally dependent on elevation-driven variation in temperature and precipitation. Our results demonstrate the potential for a coupled hydrology-ecosystem carbon cycling model that includes a simple model of NSC dynamics to predict drought-related mortality. Given that increases in temperature and in the frequency and severity of drought are predicted for a broad range of ponderosa pine and other western North America conifer forest habitats, the model potentially has broad utility for assessing ecosystem vulnerabilities.", "year": 2013}]}
