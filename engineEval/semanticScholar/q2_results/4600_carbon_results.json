Anyway, the fact is that those combinations are less pollutant than the portfolios in the efficient frontier. Thus, a policy-maker can analyse which is their effect on emissions reduction.

Based on data on the production and consumption of various kinds of energy and the emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, in 1990\u20132017, changes in the structure of the global energy consumption, trends in electric power generation, and the influence of different factors on the carbon dioxide emissions in power-generating enterprises are investigated. It is shown that the power industry, which is the main source of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs), is the most inertial branch of the economy in terms of its contribution to the reduction in GHG emissions. Thus, in the first 2008\u20132012 commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, GHG emissions in the state parties to the protocol decreased by 7.6% compared the base year, while other GHG sources reduced the emission by 18%. The corresponding figures for the following 2013\u20132017 commitment period were 10.6 and 17.1%, respectively. The maximum reduction in the carbon dioxide emissions in the power industry resulted from an increase in the global average efficiency of the thermal power stations from 32% in 1990 to 36% in 2017; as a consequence, the cumulative decrease in the CO2 emissions in the world during the 1990\u20132017 period was approximately 22 billion t. The increase in the electric power generation at HPPs and NPPs resulted in a reduction in GHG emissions by 16.7 and 10.7 billion t, respectively. The substitution of coal and fuel oil by gas at thermal power stations facilitated reducing the emissions by 5.2 billion t, while the use of renewable energy sources for generation of electric energy resulted in a reduction of 1.1 billion t.

This paper gives a general overview of the indirect and direct use of captured CO2 in CCUS with a special focus on worldwide large-scale CO2-EOR projects and their lifecycle emissions. On the basis of scientific papers and technical reports, data from 23 contemporary large-scale CO2-EOR projects in different project stages were aggregated, pointing out all the specificities of the projects. The specificities of individual projects, along with the lack of standardized methodologies specific for estimating the full lifecycle emissions resulting from CO2-EOR projects, pose a challenge and contribute to uncertainties and wide flexibilities when estimating emissions from CO2-EOR projects, making the cross-referencing of CO2-EOR projects and its comparison to other climate-mitigation strategies rather difficult.

One of the main perceived risks in CO2 geological storage is migration or leakage of the buoyant CO2 stream through the seal, via faults or fractures, or other migration out of the storage complex.

As a part of this program, alkaline microporous pellets, recently developed, were used to sample the 14CO2 in air near waste storage structures and near the waste management area. These pellets were never fully characterized for their ability to capture high levels of 14CO2, and the processing and analysis needed to be improved to provide data on recoveries and consistencies, for an eventual method validation, with independent calibrations and standards. The sample analysis scheme also had to accommodate 14CO2 levels varying from near the natural background (250 Bq kg-1 C), to potentially three to four orders of magnitude above this value, near the wastes. The porous alkaline solid pellets were used for the passive capture of airborne 14CO2 over a period of weeks, to a few months. The pellets were processed to release the captured CO2 (14CO2 and 12CO2) into a NaOH solution, which was subsequently analyzed by liquid scintillation. Processing of the pellets yielded a 14C recovery of 96.0 +/- 4.2% and a lower, but consistent total carbon recovery, i.e., 85.9 +/- 2.7 and 86.9 +/- 2.6%, for procedural blanks and standards, respectively. The detection limits for the pellet sampling and processing was sufficient to reach environmental levels. For the higher levels of 14CO2 and for 'spot' sampling, we also used air samples, pumped into a NaOH solution to trap the 14CO2. These NaOH solutions were counted directly for 14C, also by liquid scintillation. The method limits of this latter technique, although much higher than for pellet samples, also achieved the performance objective for detecting airborne 14CO2.

The potential solutions of energy storage of excess generation from renewables through hydrogen production and precombustion carbon capture are gaining momentum. Both scenarios require gas turbines capable of operation with hydrogen-based fuels. At the same time, the composition of natural gas considered for use within gas turbines is becoming significantly more variable due to increased use of liquefied natural gas and a wider range of gas sources and extraction methods. Fuel flexibility, both in terms of the amount of hydrogen and higher hydrocarbons is therefore of utmost importance in modern gas turbine development.

Ultimately, this allows the achievement of ultra-low emissions at full combustor exit temperature maintaining the power and efficiency performance of F and H class engines.

In Croatia, a first\u2010of\u2010its\u2010kind biorefinery project is currently underway that aims to integrate a second\u2010generation ethanol plant into an existing fossil refinery. The goal is to replace the fossil fuel production by second\u2010generation ethanol production using miscanthus. In the ethanol fermentation, CO2 is emitted in highly concentrated form and this can be directly compressed, injected and stored in exploited oil reservoirs. This study presents an assessment of the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential of miscanthus ethanol produced in combination with CCS technology, based on data from the planning process of this biorefinery project. The GHG reduction potential is evaluated as part of a full environmental life cycle assessment. This is of particular relevance as a lignocellulosic ethanol industry is currently emerging in the European Union (EU) and LCAs of BECCS systems have, so far, often omitted environmental impacts other than GHG emissions. Overall, the ethanol to be produced in this planned biorefinery project would clearly achieve the EU's global warming potential (GWP) reduction target for biofuels. Depending on the accounting approach applied for the biological carbon storage, reduction potentials between 104% and 138% relative to the fossil comparator are likely. In addition, ethanol can reduce risks to resource availability. As such, the results generated from data based on the intended biorefinery project support the two major rationales for biofuel use. However, these reductions could come at the expense of human health and ecosystem quality impacts associated with the combustion of lignin and biogas.

Some pathways can only be implemented in kraft mills, e.g. black liquor gasification (BLG), but some can be implemented industry-wide, e.g. carbon capture and storage (CCS). From a future perspective it is not clear which pathway is the most profitable one or which pathway gives the lowest emissions of CO2 due to uncertainties in both the future value of different products and the future development of energy infrastructure. This can lead to decision anxiety, both for the PPI regarding the choice of pathways and for decision-makers creating new policy schemes. \nThe overall aim of this thesis is to analyse six technology pathways for the European PPI: increased electricity production, export of bark, extraction of lignin, CCS, BLG and export of heat for district heating purposes. To elucidate the potential for, and effects of, implementation of these pathways, three themes of research questions are addressed: \n1. General integration opportunities in different types of existing mills. \n2. Economic performance and global CO2 emissions assuming different future developments of the European energy market. \n3. Factors influencing the potential for industry-wide implementation. \nThe results show that for kraft pulp mills, proven pathways, such as increased electricity production and district heat production, are economically robust, i.e. they are profitable for varying energy market conditions. The new and emerging technology pathways studied, CCS, BLG and lignin extraction, hold a larger potential for reduction of global CO2 emissions, but their economic performance is more dependent on the development of the energy market. Further, the thesis shows how earlier, detailed research can be lifted to a higher system level in order to be put in context and to answer research questions on a more aggregated industry level.

Patterns of atmospheric CO2 distributions in terms of leakage detection can be observed on large scales with the help of infrared spectroscopy or micrometeorological methods, which aim to identify zones with unexpected or anomalous atmospheric CO2 concentrations. On the meso-scale, exchange processes between ground surface level and subsurface structures need to be localized using geophysical methods and soil gas surveys. Subsequently, the resulting images and maps can be used for selecting profiles for detailed in situ soil gas and geophysical monitoring, which helps to constrain the extent of leakages and allows us to understand controlling features of the observable fluid flow patterns.

For supercritical compressor operation close to the critical point there is a concern that the working fluid could cross into the subcritical regime which could lead to issues with compressor performance if condensation was to occur in regions where the fluid dropped below the saturation point. Presently, the question of whether there is sufficient residence time at subcritical conditions for condensation onset in supercritical CO2 compressors is an unresolved issue. A methodology is presented towards providing a validated simulation capability for predicting condensation in supercritical CO2 compressors. The modeling framework involves the solution of a discrete droplet phase coupled to the continuum gas phase to track droplet nucleation and growth.

A non-equilibrium phase-change model is applied to predict condensation on the nuclei which grow in a dispersed-phase droplet framework. Model validation is provided against experimental data for condensation of supercritical CO2 in a De Laval nozzle including the Wilson line location. The model is then applied for prediction of condensation in the compressor of the Sandia test loop at mildly supercritical inlet conditions.

A mix of renewables, nuclear and fossil fuels with CCS will be needed to achieve this goal. This development will affect gas turbine sales and their development. INTRODUCTION Secure, reliable and affordable energy resources are fundamental to economic stability and growth. The erosion of energy security, rising energy costs, the threat of disruptive climate change and the growing energy needs of the developing world all pose major challenges to energy decision makers. What visions of the future that address these issues are technically feasible and available? Where do we need to focus? And who needs to act and when? The recent IEA study Energy Technology Perspectives 2008 (ETP) provides an analysis of the status and future prospects of key energy technologies, and shows how they can contribute to a more sustainable, secure and least-cost energy system (IEA, 2008). It explores how technology can change our energy future, and outlines the barriers to the implementation of change and the measures that would be needed to overcome these barriers. The goal of the analysis is to provide a technology perspective on the feasibility and costs of deep emission reductions; the book includes various scenarios, amongst them an extremely ambitious one, showing how CO2 emissions could be reduced to 50% below current levels by 2050 and how oil demand could be lowered by 27% by this time. This study also contains roadmaps for all technologies that play a key role in the emissions halving scenario. It does not deal with the political feasibility of such targets. However, the results make clear that all countries need to act in the next few years if the goal of halving emissions is to remain affordable. In fact the analysis suggests that such action could also greatly enhance the supply security. The challenge is huge, given that energy CO2 emissions have been accelerating in recent years. Plus, economic activity is projected to grow by a factor of four between now and 2050, from around USD 50 trillion GDP per year to around USD 200 trillion per year. This growth is essential to lifting millions in developing countries out of poverty, and the same economic growth rate has been applied in all scenarios. However, it means that without further action, baseline energy use could double and emissions could increase by 130% by 2050. Reducing demand for energy services can therefore only play a limited role. But technological change can help industrialized countries and emerging economies alike. In ETP, the IEA analyses -amongst other scenarios -what would be required to achieve the most ambitious scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC). In its 4 report, the IPCC says that only by reducing global CO2 emissions by 50% to 85%, compared to 2000 emissions levels, can we expect to limit temperature increases to 2-2.4\u00b0C. G8 leaders agreed at their 2008 Hokkaido Summit to International Journal of Gas Turbine, Propulsion and Power Systems February 2010, Volume 3, Number 1 Copyright \u00a9 2010 Gas Turbine Society of Japan Manuscript received on Feb. 26, 2009 Review completed on Feb. 26, 2010 1 emissions halving by 2050. What needs to be done to make this happen from an energy point of view? The answer is sobering but attainable: We need a global energy technology revolution, a complete transformation in the way we produce and use energy, with action required globally in the next few years. Electricity supply and demand will be significantly affected. The efficiency of electricity supply, transmission and distribution and use needs to be maximised. Electricity supply needs to be virtually decarbonised. The mix of CO2-free power supply options will vary worldwide, depending on natural resource endowment, consumer preferences and other factors. In the longer term, electrification of the demand side may play an increasing role, for example heat pumps and electric vehicles. THE BLUE SCENARIOS AND THE ROLE OF ENERGY TECHNOLOGY The analysis is built around three sets of global energy technology scenarios. These are a Baseline (business-as-usual Scenario), ACT scenarios aiming for emissions that are in 2050 mitigated to today\u2019s levels and a range of BLUE Scenarios showing how CO2 emissions could be reduced to 50% below current levels by 2050. A 50% reduction of worldwide emissions by 2050 (as in the BLUE scenarios) would be an extremely challenging target. This would require measures with a cost of up to USD 200/t CO2. With less-optimistic technology assumptions, notably in transportation, costs could be USD 500/t CO2. The transition cost will be considerable. The average emission reduction costs in this scenario are about a fifth of the marginal cost, and range from USD 38/t CO2 to USD 117/t CO2. In total, five variants have been analysed for the power sector for BLUE scenarios. These are: MAP \u2013 relatively optimistic for all technologies. High nuclear (hi NUC) \u2013 2000 GW instead of 1 250 GW maximum nuclear capacity. No carbon capture and storage (no CCS). Low renewables (lo REN) \u2013 assuming less cost reductions for renewable power generation technologies. Low end-use efficiency gains (lo EFF) \u2013 assuming a 0.3% lower annual energy efficiency improvement, compared to MAP. The ETP scenarios require a broad portfolio of technologies to be used. End-use efficiency accounts for 36% of all savings in the BLUE Map scenario, renewables for 21%, and CO2 capture and storage 19%. The remaining 24% is accounted for by nuclear, fossil fuel switching and efficiency in power generation (Figure 1). Some flexibility exists to vary these shares, which is reflected through the five scenarios for the power sector and four for transport. Improving energy efficiency should be a priority. Many efficiency measures can be implemented with relatively short lead times, and full life costs are often negative. Fig. 1 Contribution of emissions reductions options in the BLUE Map Scenario of ETP 2008, between 2005 and 2050 (IEA, 2008a) First, we must harvest the huge efficiency potential in all of our economies. Energy efficiency has the greatest potential for CO2 savings at lowest cost and is in many cases even paying off. And results can be delivered soon. The IEA submitted 25 energy efficiency recommendations to the G8 Summit in Hokkaido, covering seven priority areas: buildings; appliances; lighting; transport; industry; power utilities and cross-sectoral activity (IEA, 2008b). The proposed actions could save around 8.2 gigatonnes (Gt) CO2/year by 2030. This is equivalent to around one fifth of global reference case CO2 emissions from the energy sector in 2030.

Furthermore, the rapid renewal in the industrial technology has brought about the need to upgrade hazard identification methodologies. Accident scenarios of emerging technologies, which are not still properly identified, may remain unidentified until they take place for the first time. The consideration of atypical scenarios deviating from normal expectations of unwanted events or worst case reference scenarios is thus extremely challenging. A specific method named Dynamic Procedure for Atypical Scenarios Identification (DyPASI) was developed as a complementary tool to bow-tie identification techniques. The main aim of the methodology is to provide an easier but comprehensive hazard identification of the industrial process analysed, by systematizing information from early signals of risk related to past events, near misses and inherent studies. DyPASI was validated on the two examples of new and emerging technologies: Liquefied Natural Gas regasification and Carbon Capture and Storage. The study broadened the knowledge on the related emerging risks and, at the same time, demonstrated that DyPASI is a valuable tool to obtain a complete and updated overview of potential hazards. Moreover, in order to tackle underlying accident causes of atypical events, three methods for the development of early warning indicators were assessed: the Resilience-based Early Warning Indicator (REWI) method, the Dual Assurance method and the Emerging Risk Key Performance Indicator method. REWI was found to be the most complementary and effective of the three, demonstrating that its synergy with DyPASI would be an adequate strategy to improve hazard identification methodologies towards the capture of atypical accident scenarios.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "0b284d683ec01ee7117d78aed9edb2dd1ce109a9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "296349134", "CorpusId": 107561296}, "title": "Pre Study of CCS for a Bio Fueled CHP Plant", "abstract": "The environmental performance of a potential carbon capture and storage (CCS) installation at the bio fueled combined heat and power (CHP) plant in Lugnvik, Ostersund was studied with screening life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology.

In IOR, we design the process to leave as little residual oil behind as possible, while for CCS, we do the opposite: we wish to maximise the amount of CO2 trapped by the host brine. Reservoir rocks display a range of wettability, from being preferentially water-wet\u2013they spontaneously imbibe water\u2013to oil-wet, or water repellent. Many rocks are mixed-wet, with both water-wet and oil-wet pores. The other wettability state is more intermediate-wet where, as we show, the rock appears to be largely non-wetting to both oil and water. Carbonate reservoirs, which house the majority of the world\u2019s remaining conventional oil, and which offer potential storage locations for carbon dioxide, have an altered wettability after contact with crude oil. In this thesis we study spontaneous displacement and trapping in carbonate rocks for different wettability conditions. The rate of spontaneous imbibition governs the rate with which oil, or carbon dioxide is trapped, while the residual saturation quantifies how much trapped. This is particularly important in carbonate reservoirs, which are almost extensively fractured. In these reservoirs, the principal mechanism for displacement is spontaneous imbibition of water to displace oil (or carbon dioxide) in the water-wet portions of the pore space. Pore structure and wettability are two of the main factors affecting displacement and capillary trapping. Experimental and pore-scale modelling studies have found a monotonic increase of residual non-wetting phase saturation, Snwr, with the initial non-wetting phase saturation, Snwi in a water-wet medium. However, altered-wettability systems have received relatively little attention, particularly those which are intermediate-wet. We first present the three carbonates we study in this thesis: Estaillades, Ketton and Portland. These are three quarry limestones that have very different pore structures and span a wide range of permeability. We present standard core analysis results including mercury injection capillary pressure and nuclear magnetic resonance response.

We use these experiments to assess the pore size distribution; we show that all the samples have micro-porosity and use the results to interpret the trapping and displacement experiments performed later.

Pure CaO was used as benchmarked sorbent in this study. The samples were synthesized using the sol-gel method and CaO:NiO were evaluated for their performance in CaO carbonation at different sorption temperatures, from its CO2 sorption capacity, CO2 sorption rate, and kinetic performance. CaO:NiO has demonstrated an excellent CO2 sorption capacity of 0.79 mmol CO2/mmol CaO, meanwhile pure CaO exhibited lower CO2 sorption capacity of 0.61 mmol CO2/mmol CaO at 600 \u00b0C. During the chemical reaction controlled stage, the CO2 sorption rate of CaO:NiO was 0.78 mmol CO2/mmol CaO.min at 600 \u00b0C compared to pure CaO with sorption rate of 0.18 mmol CO2/mmol CaO.min. This study indicates that the addition of nickel oxide has successfully improved the CO2 sorption rate and capacity of CaO for CaO:NiO.

Experimental carbonation data for CaO:NiO fitted very well to the shrinking core model (SCM) with high correlation coefficient (R2 >0.936).

During peak demand, the stored refrigerant is used in place of continuously generating refrigerant in a steady-state system.

Flexible CO2 capture designs could, however, allow CCS power plants to temporarily reduce the level of CO2 capture, thus, in the short term, the energy penalty could potentially act as a \u201cstrategic virtual reserve\u201d that could reduce the risk of fossil fuel supply interruptions and provide extra reserve capacity margin. Furthermore, an upgradable futureproof design for CO2 capture could help avoid \u201cenergy penalty lock-in\u201d during a plant\u2019s lifetime as technology learning takes place. In 2011, global emissions of carbon dioxide increased by 1 Gt, of which 720 Mt of the increase was attributable to China. China\u2019s share of global emissions increased to 24%, now far ahead of the United States, the next largest emitter, at 15%. Overall, 45% of global CO2 emissions are produced from coal and fully half of those emissions are from China, the vast majority of which is used in the power sector. Therefore, CCS, as the only technology that can decarbonize fossil fuels, should logically be central to any plausible strategy for significant cuts in emissions. On the other hand, China is the second largest importer of crude oil in the world in 2012. Even more dramatically, China shifted from being a net exporter to a net importer of coal in 2009 and by 2011 became the largest net importer of coal in the world, though there is still debate on whether China will need to increase coal imports in the future. Energy conservation is a top Chinese national development target, but energy demand will inevitably grow substantially in the next two decades given that Chinese per capita energy consumption remains much lower than the OECD average level even though its per capita CO2 emissions are reaching European levels. Despite these pressures, security of primary energy supply has become a major national priority. In 2011, the Chinese government (National Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of Finance) launched the emergency coal reserve program that encourages large coal-mining companies, large power generation companies, and major coal transportation terminals to develop a strategic coal reserve. Deploying state-of-the-art CCS technologies in the power generation sector would avoid roughly 85% of CO2 emissions with an energy penalty of 20\u221230%. An aggressive strategy to capture CO2 at, say, 40% of Chinese coal-fired power plants would then lead to a rise of approximately 10% in national coal consumption, equivalent to 1.5 times net coal imports in 2010. In other words, significant extra fossil fuel consumption and power plant infrastructure would be required if CCS technologies were widely deployed. This explains why even though CCS is widely recognized as a key technology to decarbonize the Chinese fossil fuel dominated energy system, there is very limited financial support for demonstrating and deploying CCS projects at large-scale. CCS is therefore not currently a high priority on the list of possible climate technology options also compatible with energy supply security and energy efficiency priorities. The extra energy infrastructure requirement for CCS to meet peak electricity demand could be minimized through flexibility in operating CCS systems (e.g., by shutting down CO2 capture during supply shocks) while the experience curve could reduce the energy penalty in the long term.

With a flexible CO2 capture design, CCS power plants could temporarily reduce the level of CO2 capture in order to generate more power to complement intermittent and inflexible technologies in the energy system.

A good place to begin is with efficiency. Although there are enormous opportunities for reducing emissions through increased efficiency, we often fail to take advantage of them, even when we could save money by doing so. There are a number of reasons, but Richter rightly observes that major contributors include the existence of misguided subsidies and our practice of using the world\u2019s atmosphere \u201cas a free dump for greenhouse gases\u201d (p. 88). If electricity producers had to pay for the use of this dump, as he notes, \u201cthe situation would change in a flash\u201d (p. 88). But this observation shifts the focus from an examination of the options to a consideration of the politics of climate change. In summarizing the merits of the options, Richter says that he is \u201cskeptical about achieving big emissions reductions without nuclear and hydro power, but even with them would feel much more confident if CCS [carbon capture and storage] could be made to work\u201d (p. 188). He dismisses corn-based ethanol as simply a subsidy to farmers and (perhaps more controversially) concludes that we cannot count on renewables like wind and solar to solve the problem anytime soon. He takes issue with what he calls the ultra greens who \u201cseem to have forgotten that the objective is to cut greenhouse gas emission[s], not just to run the world on windmills and solar cells\u201d (p. 2). Many thoughtful readers will take issue with Richter\u2019s support for nuclear power and CCS, but he does make an argument that needs to be taken seriously in this regard. Part III, on \u201cPolicy,\u201d is somewhat disappointing. Starting from the dubious proposition that \u201c[t]oday the public is engaged and there is a broad consensus that the United States has to join the effort to mitigate global warming\u201d (p. 210), the author limits himself to a consideration of the pros and cons of alternative policy instruments (e.g., cap and trade vs. emission fees) and calls for the development of a strengthened international agreement to replace the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. As a result, he does not tackle the politics of climate change. Although he applies the idea of the tragedy of the commons to the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, there is no serious effort in this book to come to terms with a range of problems that block efforts to achieve substantial emissions reductions, including 1) the freerider problem with respect to burden sharing, 2) the influence of vested interests, 3) the role of perverse subsidies, and 4) the effects of path dependence that make it hard to alter business as usual. Perhaps this accounts for Richter\u2019s disarmingly frank conclusion that \u201c[s]ince I have become involved in energy and proliferation issues I have learned one new thing: politics\u2014particularly international politics\u2014is much harder that physics\u201d (p. 216). Nevertheless, this book constitutes an excellent point of entry for anyone seeking an accessible and well-informed account of the options available to us in efforts to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. While some readers will disagree with his judgments regarding specific options (e.g., the argument that we should push nuclear energy despite the proliferation problem), we are in his debt for reminding us regularly that the central concern is reducing GHG emissions and presenting the options in a manner that allows the reader to make informed judgments about the best way to tackle the climate problem.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "9eb2a2e1da3bb25db7bc8f9a3414fea1fb186ca1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3033795867", "DOI": "10.1080/19397038.2020.1773570", "CorpusId": 219915686}, "title": "Enhancing electricity supply mix in Oman with energy storage systems: a case study", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Over the past decade, population growth and industry expansion in Oman have led to an increase in electricity demand of more than 240%. The main challenges of utilising renewable energy resources in Oman include high capital costs and their intermittent nature. Enhancing the integration of renewable energy sources from wind and solar into the conventional power network requires the mitigation of vulnerabilities posed to the network owing to the intermittent nature of these sources. One possible solution for such a problem is to utilise large-scale energy storage such as pumped-hydroelectric, compressed air, or Hydrogen storage.

However, cereal roots can potentially acquire nutrients including organic and inorganic nitrogen (N) from deep in the soil profile. Greater knowledge on the interaction of plants and microbes in subsoil environments is required to evaluate whether deep rooting traits in cereals will achieve greater nutrient use efficiency and greater soil carbon (C) storage in cropping systems. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between root distribution, organic and inorganic N availability and potential N supply at the critical growth period during the wheat cropping cycle in a sand textured Eutric Cambisol. Our results provide evidence of significant microbial capacity in the subsoil. The rate of plant residue turnover and the mineralization of organic C and N substrates (glucose, amino acids, peptides, protein) declined slightly with increasing soil depth; however, these rates were not correlated with basal soil respiration, microbial biomass or community structure. This suggests that the microbial population in subsoil is more C limited but that its activity can be readily stimulated upon C substrate addition. A significant potential for organic and inorganic N turnover was also demonstrated at depth with a similar abundance of ammonifiers and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) throughout the soil profile. Again, N mineralization in subsoils appears to be substrate limited. Root density declined rapidly down the soil profile with few roots present past 50 cm; suggesting that this is the major factor limiting C recharge of soil organic matter and microbial activity in subsoils. Greater root proliferation at depth could allow greater capture of water and the recapture of N lost by leaching; however, our results suggest that plant-microbial competition for C and N is as intense in the subsoil as in the topsoil. We conclude that while deeper rooting may improve nutrient and water use efficiency it may not lead to much greater C sequestration in subsoils, at least in the short term.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "6e471f2e03f9889eccc482ac53d23b1b6301b473", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1553541371", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-642-02682-9_137", "CorpusId": 136951884}, "title": "Numerical Simulation on Hydrodynamics and Combustion in a Circulating Fluidized Bed under O 2 /CO 2 and Air Atmospheres", "abstract": "Oxy-fuel circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion technology is in the stage of initial development for carbon capture and storage (CCS).

With lower input price, oil rms are indirectly subsidized and oil production and emissions increase.

In particular, utilization of atmospheric CO 2 by algae has been proposed for carbon capture, particularly at high pH since CO 2 absorption rates increase with increasing pH. The goal of this study was to quantify the growth and inorganic carbon utilization of a mixed freshwater green algal culture at high pH. Algal cultures were supplied with different initial media inorganic carbon concentrations (11 to 32 mg C L -1 as Na 2 CO 3 ), maintained in a controlled environment, and adjusted to an initial pH of 10.3. Samples were taken daily to measure pH, alkalinity, inorganic carbon, and total suspended solids. Results indicated that the culture was dominated by at all inorganic carbon concentrations.

The model is mathematically formulated as a very large-scale linear optimization problem, aiming to minimize system costs, including generation type, fuel costs, conversion costs, and carbon reduction costs, subject to the constraint of carbon dioxide reductions for each nation. Results show that between approximately 0.8% and 2% of global energy consumption needs can be met by hydrogen out to the year 2050, with city gas and transport emerging as significant use cases. Passenger FCVs and hydrogen buses account for almost all of the hydrogen-based transportation sector, leading to a global deployment of approximately 120 million FCVs by 2050.

To underpin hydrogen production from fossil fuels, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is required in significant quantities when anticipating a large fleet of FCVs.

Biomass and coal co\u2010firing with CCS is one of BECCS technologies, as well as a pathway to achieve low carbon transformation and upgrading through retrofitting coal power plants. However, few studies have considered co\u2010firing ratio of biomass to coal based on each specific coal power plant's characteristic information such as location, installed capacity, resources allocation, and logistic transportation. Therefore, there is a need to understand whether it is worth retrofitting any individual coal power plant for the benefit of GHG emission reduction. It is also important to understand which power plant is suitable for retrofit and the associated co\u2010firing ratio. In order to fulfill this gap, this paper develops a framework to solve these questions, which mainly include three steps. First, biomass resources are assessed at 1 km spatial resolution with the help of the Geography Information Science method. Second, by setting biomass collection points and linear program model, resource allocation and supply chain for each power plants are complete. Third, is by assessing the life\u2010cycle emission for each power plant. In this study, Hubei Province in China is taken as the research area and study case. The main conclusions are as follows: (a) biomass co\u2010firing ratio for each CCS coal power plant to achieve carbon neutral is between 40% and 50%; (b) lower co\u2010firing ratio sometimes may obtain better carbon emission reduction benefits; (c) even the same installed capacity power plants should consider differentiated retrofit strategy according to their own characteristic.

The model for fracture hydrodynamics is obtained by averaging the mass conservation equation across the fracture aperture giving rise to a reduced balance law posed in the interface supplemented by a source term arising from the jump in the gas flux from the shale matrix. In order to build a model for such matrix flux we construct a new pressure equation for gas hydrodynamics at the mesoscale, where the shale is envisioned an homogenized matrix composed of interparticle pores and nanopores within the kerogen along with an impermeable inorganic matter constituted by a reactive clay and an inert solid phase. Constitutive laws for the retardation parameter which captures the adsorption of methane in the nanopores are constructed from the homogenization of the finer scales. Within the framework of the multiscale model we postulate governing equation at the microscale where kerogen particles and nanopores are viewed as overlaying continua forming the organic aggregates at local thermodynamic equilibrium with the free gas in the water partially saturated interparticle pores and also with adsorbed gas at the surface of inorganic matter occupied by clay. The behavior of sorbed gas lying in the kerogen aggregates and on the clay surface is coupled with both Fickian diffusion of dissolved gas in water and Darcy free gas flow in the interparticle pores. By postulating continuity of fugacity between free and dissolved gas in the interparticle pores and neglecting the water movement, the microscopic problem is upscaled to the mesoscale where kerogen aggregates, inert inorganic matter, clay and interparticle pores are homogenized. The upscaling furnishes a new storage parameter and effective conductivity which appear in the pressure equation dependent on pressure, the total carbon content (TOC), water saturation, clay content and nano and micro porosities. The closure of the fracture/matrix coupled system hinges on the constitutive law for the partition coefficient governing gas adsorption within the intra-kerogen nanopores and on the clay surfaces.

Policymakers now face the challenging task to revitalize the EU ETS and bring its ability to trigger investment in line with policy objectives.

Therefore CCUS coupled with EOR is considered to be an economic approach to demonstration of commercial-scale injection and storage of anthropogenic CO2. Several critical issues should be taken into account prior to injecting large volumes of CO2, such as storage capacity, project duration and long-term containment. Reservoir characterization and 3D geological modeling are the best way to estimate the theoretical CO2 storage capacity in mature oil fields. The Jacksonburg-Stringtown field, located in northwestern West Virginia, has produced over 22 million barrels of oil (MMBO) since 1895. The sandstone of the Late Devonian Gordon Stray is the primary reservoir. The Upper Devonian fluvial sandstone reservoirs in Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field, which has produced over 22 million barrels of oil since 1895, are an ideal candidate for CO2 sequestration coupled with EOR. Supercritical depth (>2500 ft.), minimum miscible pressure (941 psi), favorable API gravity (46.5\u00b0) and good water flood response are indicators that facilitate CO2EOR operations. Moreover, Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field is adjacent to a large concentration of CO2 sources located along the Ohio River that could potentially supply enough CO2 for sequestration and EOR without constructing new pipeline facilities. Permeability evaluation is a critical parameter to understand the subsurface fluid flow and reservoir management for primary and enhanced hydrocarbon recovery and efficient carbon storage. In this study, a rapid, robust and cost-effective artificial neural network (ANN) model is constructed to predict permeability using the model's strong ability to recognize the possible interrelationships between input and output variables. Two commonly available conventional well logs, gamma ray and bulk density, and three logs derived variables, the slope of GR, the slope of bulk density and Vsh were selected as input parameters and permeability was selected as desired output parameter to train and test an artificial neural network. The results indicate that the ANN model can be applied effectively in permeability prediction. Porosity is another fundamental property that characterizes the storage capability of fluid and gas bearing formations in a reservoir. In this study, a support vector machine (SVM) with mixed kernels function (MKF) is utilized to construct the relationship between limited conventional well log suites and sparse core data. The input parameters for SVM model consist of core porosity values and the same log suite as ANN\u2019s input parameters, and porosity is the desired output. Compared with results from the SVM model with a single kernel function, mixed kernel function based SVM model provide more accurate porosity prediction values. Base on the well log analysis, four reservoir subunits within a marine-dominated estuarine depositional system are defined: barrier sand, central bay shale, tidal channels and fluvial channel subunits. A 3-D geological model, which is used to estimate theoretical CO2 sequestration capacity, is constructed with the integration of core data, wireline log data and geological background knowledge. Depending on the proposed 3-D geological model, the best regions for coupled CCUS-EOR are located in southern portions of the field, and the estimated CO2 theoretical storage capacity for Jacksonburg-Stringtown oil field vary between 24 to 383 million metric tons. The estimation results of CO2 sequestration and EOR potential indicate that the Jacksonburg-Stringtown oilfield has significant potential for CO2 storage and value-added EOR.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "c10ecc565e3ede0386bdff3f22270d0434d7bfdb", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 13725117}, "title": "Inserting CO 2 into Aryl C \u00a2 H Bonds of Metal \u2013 Organic Frameworks : CO 2 Utilization for Direct Heterogeneous C \u00a2 H Activation", "abstract": "Described for the first time is that carbon dioxide (CO2) can be successfully inserted into aryl C\u00a2H bonds of the backbone of a metal\u2013organic framework (MOF) to generate free carboxylate groups, which serve as Br\u00f8nsted acid sites for efficiently catalyzing the methanolysis of epoxides. The work delineates the very first example of utilizing CO2 for heterogeneous C\u00a2H activation and carboxylation reactions on MOFs, and opens a new avenue for CO2 chemical transformations under mild reaction conditions. Carbon dioxide (CO2), the major component of greenhouse gases, accumulates in the atmosphere at an alarming rate and is deemed as the main culprit for global warming and climate change. Thus, there are increasing demands for carbon capture and sequestration as CO2 emissions are currently a matter of genuine public concern. In contrast with CO2 capture and storage by sorbent materials, the chemical transformation of CO2 into value-added products represents an alternative which is attractive and sustainable, and has been of an escalating interest. CO2 could serve as an ideal C1 source for organic synthesis because of its abundance, nontoxicity, and potential as a renewable resource. Nonetheless, the inertness of CO2 makes it a formidable challenge to directly activate a CO2 molecule and form a C\u00a2C bond, particularly under mild reaction conditions. This challenge has triggered continuous yet intensive interest in the research of CO2 activation, for example, chemical fixation and reduction of CO2. [3\u20135] Over the past two decades, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as a new family of functional porous materials with great potential for applications in gas storage/ separation, catalysis, sensing, conductivity, etc. In particular, MOFs have been extensively investigated as sorbents for CO2 capture and storage, [12] and recently there has also been increasing interest in exploring MOFs as catalysts for CO2 chemical fixation and/or reduction. [13] Distinct from existing studies, we herein describe a new approach for the utilization of CO2 as a C1 building block by chemically inserting CO2 into aryl C\u00a2H bonds of MOF backbones to generate free carboxylate groups, which not only remains as the most obviously incompatible functional group within MOFs because carboxylate groups are used as linking motifs, but also features as a prominent functionality in various applications. Our work delineates the very first example of utilizing CO2 for direct solid-state C\u00a2H activation and carboxylation reactions on a MOF, and the generated carboxylate group provides an opportunity for further exploration in terms of application and modification of the MOF. This proof-of-concept study thereby presents a new scenario for the utilization of CO2 with a MOF platform and also contributes a different perspective to the current landscape of CO2 capture and transformation. Our inspiration to insert CO2 into the aryl C\u00a2H bond of the backbone of a MOF for direct heterogeneous C\u00a2H activation is based upon the tremendous progress recently made in the field of C\u00a2H functionalization/activation in homogeneous systems. To demonstrate the proof-of-concept, we selected the MOF UiO-67 as the platform for studies because of its remarkable chemical stability and large pore size. The linear linker of 2-phenylpyridine-5,4\u2019-dicarboxylic acid (dcppy) is employed to construct the UiO MOF, which can facilitate the introduction of cyclometalated complexes into the host framework for further postsynthetic modification. As shown in Figure 1, the resultant UiO-67(dcppy) is constructed from the inorganic SBUs (secondary building units) of Zr6O4(OH)4 bound to twelve organic linkers of dcppy, thus affording a three-dimensional periodic fcu-type network. Two types of cages sustain the structure: a centric octahedral cage connected to eight tetrahedral cages through triangular windows. Experiments were then conducted to insert gaseous CO2 into the aryl C\u00a2H bond of the backbone in UiO-67(dcppy), and they were promoted by a catalytic species, methylrhodium(I), in N,N\u2019-dimethylacetamide as the solvent Figure 1.

As illustrated in Scheme 1, the heterogeneous C\u00a2H bond activation experiment on UiO-67(dcppy) utilizes the combination of a rhodium catalyst and methylaluminum reagent as a stoichiometric reductant. The reaction details can be found in the Supporting Information. The framework integrity before and after CO2 insertion were verified by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies. As shown in Figure 2a, the resultant UiO-67(dcppy)-COOH retains all the diffraction peaks from the parent UiO-67(dcppy), and all peaks are consistent with the calculated ones. These results are in line with the claimed structural resistance and stability of UiO-67 toward various solvents and other conditions. In addition, UiO-67(dcppy) maintained its permanent porosity after insertion of CO2. As shown in Figure 2b, the N2 adsorption isotherm of UiO-67(dcppy), collected at 77 K, indicates that it possesses a Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) surface area of about 2750 m g\u00a21 (P/P0 = 0.0001\u20130.1). After the insertion of CO2 into the aryl C\u00a2H bond of UiO67(dcppy), UiO-67(dcppy)-COOH displays a decreased BET surface area of about 2160 m g\u00a21 (P/P0 = 0.0001\u20130.1), as expected for MOFs after introduction of new constituents by postsynthetic modification reactions. The successful insertion of CO2 into the C\u00a2H bond to form the carboxylate group has been initially evidenced by infrared spectroscopy studies (see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information), which reveal the appearance of a broad band centered at about 3300 cm\u00a21, and corresponds to O\u00a2H bond stretching for the fully activated UiO-67(dcppy)-COOH sample as compared to the fully activated parent material of UiO-67(dcppy). The formation of the new C\u00a2C bond from the insertion of CO2 into the C\u00a2H bond of dcppy has also been proven by C NMR spectroscopy (see Figure S2). The C NMR spectrum of digested UiO-67(dcppy) exhibited one set of expected signals attributed to dcppy. In contrast, the C NMR spectrum of digested UiO-67(dcppy)-COOH showed a unique peak at d\u0085 169.5 ppm, which is characteristic of the carbon atom in a carboxylic group deshielded by a nearby nitrogen atom. Moreover, an isotopic-labelling experiment was employed and CO2 was used as the reagent to track the fate of CO2. As illustrated in Figure S3, the assynthesized sample of UiO-67(dcppy)-COOH was directly digested in deuterated solvent and unambiguously provides an enhanced C NMR signal from the resultant carboxylate group, and thus determines that CO2 was successfully inserted into the C\u00a2H bond of UiO-67(dcppy) to form the carboxylate group. The formation of the new carboxylate moiety on the dcppy linker is further supported by the ESI-MS (electrospray ionization-mass spectroscopy) spectrum of the digested UiO67(dcppy)-COOH, and it reveals a dominant peak at m/z 288.1 which corresponds to the resultant linker 2-phenylpyridine-5,2\u2019,4\u2019-tricarboxylic acid (tcppy) as shown in Figure S3. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the digested UiO-67(dcppy)-COOH also verified the formation of the tcppy linker from CO2 insertion into the C\u00a2H bond of dcppy linker (see Figure S4), and suggests a yield of about 80 % for the CO2 insertion reaction on UiO67(dcppy). The single-crystal structure of the separated tcppy was also obtained as supporting evidence (see Figure S7 and Table S1). NH3 temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) analysis was conducted to characterize the acidity for UiO67(dcppy) and UiO-67(dcppy)-COOH. As illustrated in Figure S5, both MOF samples share a NH3 desorption peak in the range of 350\u2013425 K, which can be attributed to relative weak Lewis-acidic sites from the Zr-based SBUs. Additionally, UiO-67(dcppy)-COOH displays an extra desorption peak at the higher temperature of about 450 K, and it corresponds to NH3 bound to the stronger Br\u00f8nsted acid sites. This peak should be ascribed to the existence of the free carboxylate groups in UiO-67(dcppy)-COOH. A tentative mechanism is proposed for the chemical insertion of CO2 into the aryl C\u00a2H bond of the UiO67(dcppy) backbone (Scheme 2). The reaction starts with generation of a methylrhodium(I) complex from rhodium(I) chloride and methylaluminum reagent, followed by C\u00a2H bond activation directed by chelation effect of 2-phenylpyridine unit (oxidative addition). Subsequently, reductive elimination of methane affords a highly reactive arylrhodium(I) species, which then undergoes CO2 nucleophilic addition reaction to give a rhodium(I) benzoate complex. The transmetalation with a methylaluminum reagent closes the catalytic cycle, thus forming the carboxylate groups on the backbone of UiO-67(dcppy). Compared to the homogeneous C\u00a2H activation by CO2 as a liquid\u2013gas biphasic reaction, the heterogeneous C\u00a2H activation on the MOF represents a liquid\u2013solid\u2013gas triphasic reaction, which shares a similar Scheme 1.

When CO2 price is low, it is interesting to have flexibility and reduce the overall capture rate of the site, by stopping the capture system of one of the combustion trains if the site has multiple ones, or by adopting less than 90% CO2 capture rate.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "66998e0100ce81c5b200bcf16e83ad4abc33c491", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2642900962", "CorpusId": 113721196}, "title": "An Experimental Study of Foam Flow in Water Saturated Porous Media", "abstract": ".................................................................................................................................... iii Acknowledgements ................................................................................................................... iv Introduction ............................................................................................................................... ix Part I \u2013 Theory ............................................................................................................................ 1 1 Fundamentals in Carbon Capture Sequestration ................................................................. 3 1.1 Physical Properties of CO2 .......................................................................................... 3 1.2 CO2 Capture ................................................................................................................. 3 1.3 CO2 Transport .............................................................................................................. 4 1.4 CO2 Storage ................................................................................................................. 5 1.4.1 CO2 migration ...................................................................................................... 5 1.4.2 CO2 trapping mechanisms .................................................................................... 6 1.5 CO2 Storage Capacity and Efficiency in Saline Aquifers ........................................... 7 1.6 Displacement Instability .............................................................................................. 8 2 Foam ................................................................................................................................. 11 2.1 Definition of Foam .................................................................................................... 11 2.2 Mechanisms of Foam Generation .............................................................................. 12 2.3 Foam Flow Behavior ................................................................................................. 14 2.4 Foam Stability and Decay.......................................................................................... 15 2.5 Surfactant as Foaming Agent .................................................................................... 16 3 Reservoir Physics in CO2 Storage Schemes ..................................................................... 17 3.1 Fractured Reservoirs .................................................................................................. 17 3.2 CO2 Propagation in Fractured Geological Media ...................................................... 18 3.3 Displacement Efficiency ............................................................................................ 19 4 Literature Survey .............................................................................................................. 21 4.1 Foam Behavior in Porous Media ............................................................................... 21 4.2 Foam Behavior in Fractures ...................................................................................... 22 Part II \u2013 Experimental Procedures ........................................................................................... 25 5 Experimental Objective .................................................................................................... 27", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "8e8741def3f75755d830057b5f0f09f253c669ef", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2809420654", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-91698-9_6", "CorpusId": 169538252}, "title": "The Blue Economy: Mitigation and Adaptation", "abstract": "The science of developing an adequate database for carbon capture and storage in coastal ecosystems has progressed as has the application of this data for blue carbon projects, although not without problems. These problems have not stopped the push to incorporate blue carbon into what is now called the \u2018blue economy\u2019. Another one of the problems associated with blue carbon science and management is having a proper understanding of the actual cost of an ecosystem service, such as carbon storage; these functions can be costed in terms of their ability to assist human well-being. Stakeholder engagement is required as blue carbon projects need to be commercially attractive propositions. Insurance markets may be a way to finance or insure carbon products as carbon stores are well-recognised as a market-based commodity. The development and implementation of blue carbon projects requires a policy framework that can deal with the management, conservation and financial issues arising from such a project. A network of demonstration projects is needed to show the viability of blue carbon and to work out in a practical way the problems and pitfalls of running a project. Blue carbon as a vehicle for conservation, sustainable use and restoration also needs to be fully integrated into existing national and regional policy frameworks as a mechanism for climate change mitigation. Most projects have suffered from poor management protocols, such as not having proper success or failure criteria and have suffered from poor or uncertain methodology. Of prime importance is assessing the existing hydrology of natural habitats and then applying this information to the habitat to be restored. Financing remains a key concern for blue carbon projects, but there are many funding agencies available as finance mechanisms, including the voluntary carbon market.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "8efabeda264d3ac8c4ef3d5daa1599b940a52e10", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2965242533", "DOI": "10.5194/ESSD-12-789-2020", "CorpusId": 216501027}, "title": "Mapping the yields of lignocellulosic bioenergy crops from observations at the global scale", "abstract": "Abstract. Most scenarios from integrated assessment models (IAMs) that\nproject greenhouse gas emissions include the use of bioenergy as a means to\nreduce CO2 emissions or even to achieve negative emissions (together\nwith CCS \u2013 carbon capture and storage). The potential amount of CO2 that can be removed from the\natmosphere depends, among others, on the yields of bioenergy crops, the land\navailable to grow these crops and the efficiency with which CO2 \nproduced by combustion is captured. While bioenergy crop yields can be\nsimulated by models, estimates of the spatial distribution of bioenergy\nyields under current technology based on a large number of observations are\ncurrently lacking.\u00a0In this study, a random-forest (RF) algorithm is used to\nupscale a bioenergy yield dataset of 3963 observations covering\nMiscanthus, switchgrass, eucalypt, poplar and willow using climatic and soil\nconditions as explanatory variables. The results are global yield maps of\nfive important lignocellulosic bioenergy crops under current technology,\nclimate and atmospheric CO2 conditions at a 0.5 \u2218 \u00d7 0.5 \u2218 spatial resolution. We also provide a combined \u201cbest\nbioenergy crop\u201d yield map by selecting one of the five crop types with\nthe highest yield in each of the grid cells, eucalypt and Miscanthus in most cases.

Component temperatures were above 700\u00b0C, but stainless alloys did not have the required corrosion resistance. Experimental alloys developed in the UK were alumina formers, incorporating Ta, W, and Mo as gettering elements for sulphidation resistance. Sulphidation corrosion is solvable, but attack by HCl in gasification environments seems intractable. The supposed materials problems of gasification, plus the complexity of IGCC, have led to them being sidelined for power generation. However, commercial IGCC plants are not dependent on high temperature materials and offer higher efficiency than Rankine cycle steam. Best near term prospects for IGCC are for CO2 capture, but this constrains the type of gasifier. Gasifiers incorporating carbon capture and storage produce hydrogen, or with less capture, SNG. Such systems will supply SNG for space heating as well as electricity, and can cope with the intermittency of wind energy. High efficiency IGCCs will need very advanced gas turbines with 100 bar, 1500-1600\u00b0C turbine inlet conditions. Key requirements will be thermal barrier coatings and catalytic combustor materials. Such gas turbines would offer efficiencies of 70% in straight CCGTs, or 50% when used in carbon capture IGCCs.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "f94c70fc3d75705e8284b76e83703859d7e80a80", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2145227743", "DOI": "10.34194/GEUSB.V17.5003", "CorpusId": 54659944}, "title": "The potential for large-scale, subsurface geological CO2 storage in Denmark", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is increasingly considered to be a tool that can significantly reduce the emission of CO2.

The results of the numerous research projects on geological storage are summarised in a comprehensive best practice manual outlining guidelines for storage in saline aquifers (Chadwick et al. 2008). A detailed directive for geological storage is under implementation (European Commission 2009), and the EU has furthermore established a programme for supporting the development of more than ten large-scale demonstration plants throughout Europe.
