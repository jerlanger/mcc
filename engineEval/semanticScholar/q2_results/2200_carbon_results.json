The results of dehydrogenation of PMMA/AB and PMMA/AB/MWCNT samples show 112 and 85\u00a0\u00b0C exothermic reaction temperatures, which are dramatically lower than pure AB (120\u00a0\u00b0C). Furthermore, by capture and interaction of AB molecules in the MWCNT and PMMA nanofiber structures, the enthalpy of exothermic decomposition decreases from \u221221.00 to \u22121.83\u00a0kJ\u00a0mol\u22121 H2, suggesting that this type of AB nanofiber composite can provide a convenient reversible hydrogen storage material. The utilization of MWCNT as carbon catalyst and confining of AB result in a decrease of ammonia borane weight loss from 60.00 to 2.88\u00a0wt% which in turn can vigorously decline the emission of byproduct impurities. The synthesis process of PMMA/AB/MWCNT nanofiber composites causes the crystal structure of AB particles changed to the amorphous structure which has been clearly confirmed by X-ray diffraction analyses.

However, CO2 suppressed in geological reservoirs is likely to lead to future releases of the CO2 stored. This ?non-permanence? must be considered if an environmentally sound policy is desired. Against this background, the present article analyses a potential integration of CCS in the international climate regime. It is based on existing rules and modalities regarding non-permanence of sequestration in the Land use, Land-use change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector. Interestingly, the experience from LULUCF has almost completely been neglected during the discussion on CCS. We argue that CCS can only be accounted for in a transparent and comprehensive way, if it is considered a ?removal? (or ?sink?) activity. This is, however, incompatible with the current UNFCCC rules and definitions. Consequently, they would have to be changed. Accounting and problems of cross-border projects are discussed. They arise due to the potential geographical separation of capture and storage site. Furthermore, an economic analysis is conducted considering the consequences of non-permanent storage. We apply the tCER approach for LULUCF projects which has already been agreed upon during the international climate negotiations. It may thus form the basis for CCS, too.

We used a coupled hydrologic and ecosystem carbon cycling model to assess temperature and precipitation impacts on productivity and survival of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa). Model predictions were evaluated using observations of productivity and survival for three ponderosa pine stands located across an 800 m elevation gradient in the southern Rocky Mountains, USA, during a 10-year period that ended in a severe drought and extensive tree mortality at the lowest elevation site. We demonstrate the utility of a relatively simple representation of declines in non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) as an approach for estimating patterns of ponderosa pine vulnerability to drought and the likelihood of survival along an elevation gradient. We assess the sensitivity of simulated net primary production, NSC storage dynamics, and mortality to site climate and soil characteristics as well as uncertainty in the allocation of carbon to the NSC pool. For a fairly wide set of assumptions, the model estimates captured elevational gradients and temporal patterns in growth and biomass. Model results that best predict mortality risk also yield productivity, leaf area, and biomass estimates that are qualitatively consistent with observations across the sites. Using this constrained set of parameters, we found that productivity and likelihood of survival were equally dependent on elevation-driven variation in temperature and precipitation. Our results demonstrate the potential for a coupled hydrology-ecosystem carbon cycling model that includes a simple model of NSC dynamics to predict drought-related mortality.

We use high-resolution X-ray imaging to study the flow of oil, water and CO2 in an oil-wet rock at subsurface conditions of high temperature and pressure. We show that contrary to conventional understanding, CO2 does not reside in the largest pores, which would facilitate its escape, but instead occupies smaller pores or is present in layers in the corners of the pore space. The CO2 flow is restricted by a factor of ten, compared to if it occupied the larger pores.

A complex picture of long-term LCS scenarios comes from the range of model types and geographical scale (global vs. national); however, common themes for policy makers do emerge. A core finding is that LCS scenarios are technologically feasible. However, preferred pathways require clear and early target setting and incorporation of emissions targets across all economic activities. This will probably entail significant socio-economic changes. To realize major LCS transitions requires sustained progress in R&D and deployment of a broad range of technologies, with carbon capture and storage (CCS) a key technology in most low-carbon portfolios.

These differences resulted from the interplay of a variety of factors; some of which are related to the paleo-geographic configuration (eustatic sea level fluctuations, climatic conditions, and salt Basins), others to differential subsidence (burial) and structural inversions. During the Paleozoic, the regional compression was caused by far field effects of the Hercynian orogeny. This led to major folded structures in central and eastern Saudi Arabia (e.g. Ghawar anticline). During the Mesozoic, the most important tectonic factor was the stretching of the crust (extension), accompanied with the increase in temperature, resulting in an increase of the accommodation space, and thicker sedimentary successions. Regional unconformities are mostly found where folded structures are dominant, and they acted as a carrier systems for the accumulation of hydrocarbon and groundwater. A good understanding of the stratigraphy and tectonic evolution is, thus, required to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) and to design efficiently enhanced oil recovery (EOR) in both sectors. Oil and gas reservoirs offer geologic storage potential as well as the economic opportunity of better production through CO2-EOR. The world greatest hydrocarbon reservoirs mainly consist of Jurassic carbonate rocks, and are located around the Arabian Basin (including the eastern KSA and the Arabian Gulf). The Cretaceous reservoirs, which mainly consist of calcarenite and dolomite, are located around the Gotnia salt Basin (northeast of KSA). Depleted oil and gas fields, which generally have proven as geologic traps, reservoirs and seals, are ideal sites for storage of injected CO2. Each potential site for CO2-EOR or CCS should be evaluated for its potential storage with respect to the containment properties, and to ensure that conditions for safe and effective long term storage are present. The secured deep underground storage of CO2 implies appropriate geologic rock formations with suitable reservoir rocks, traps, and impermeable caprocks. Proposed targets for CCS, in the non-hydrocarbon-prolific sector, are Kharij super-aquifer (Triassic), Az-Zulfi aquifer (Middle Jurassic), Layla aquifer (Late Jurassic), and Wasia aquifer (Middle Cretaceous). Proposed targets for EOR are Safaniya oil field (Middle Cretaceous) (Safaniya, Wara and Khafji reservoirs), Manifa oil field (Las, Safaniya and Khafji reservoirs) (Late Jurassic), and Khuff reservoir (Late Permian-Early Triassic) in central to eastern KSA.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "6fa5493f9f4f98baa9fb239e397e6d04551b26e9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2313861831", "DOI": "10.1021/es304681x", "CorpusId": 206965565, "PubMed": "23278280"}, "title": "Environmental and geochemical aspects of geologic carbon sequestration: a special issue.", "abstract": "Sequestration: A Special Issue T need to reduce atmospheric CO2 emissions from combustion of fossil fuels becomes more clear each day with the availability of new supporting information on, for example, global temperature, ocean levels, ice cover, extreme weather events, and ecological change. According to estimates from the International Energy Agency, total global emissions of CO2 were approximately 31.6 Gt in 2011, up from 23.7 Gt in 2001 and 21.1 Gt in 1991. Because of the long residence time of CO2 in the atmosphere, it will be necessary not only to stabilize CO2 emissions, but to decrease them significantly\ue0d5in the order of 80% by 2050\ue0d5to avoid scenarios of warming, coastal inundation, drought, flooding, and other impacts with negative social and economic consequences that will be very difficult to manage. Due to the enormous amount of CO2 produced each year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations, as well as many other international bodies, has recognized that geologic carbon sequestration (GCS) will be an important part of any group of strategies to reduce CO2 emissions. Approximately 60% of global emissions of CO2 are from point sources such as electric power plants and cement kilns for which CO2 capture and geologic sequestration technology could be implemented. Since the late 1990s, a large amount of research and development on GCS has been undertaken to develop the technology and reduce its costs, and to assess technology performance and risk. While the individual components of CO2 capture, transport, and subsurface injection technology have existed for many years, they have not been integrated and implemented at anything approaching the scale needed for significant reductions in CO2 emissions, except for a small number of initial demonstration projects. Research is being conducted in Australia, Europe, the U.S., and elsewhere to enable large-scale field testing of carbon capture and geologic sequestration systems across a wide range of capture, transport, injection, and storage scenarios. Complementary research is being performed to develop improved scientific understanding of the fundamental physical and chemical processes involved, and to build models to simulate GCS technology performance and associated risks. Understanding of geochemical processes is critical for optimizing and controlling geologic carbon sequestration, and for assessing its risks. The ability to maintain injection rates into a porous formation over decades, and to maintain porosity in formations receiving fluids never before present is entirely dependent on geochemical processes. Interactions of the injected CO2 (and impurities remaining after capture from flue gases) with brines and hydrocarbons present in the receiving formations under high pressures and temperatures will yield solutions and mixed phases with unusual properties that will determine the performance of GCS. The interactions of these fluids and mixtures with the receiving formation and with overlying caprock also will determine the potential for fluid migration and leakage. The effectiveness of several important trapping mechanisms for CO2 migrating from storage zones \u2212 especially capillary trapping, solubility trapping, and mineral trapping (discussed in the feature article) will also be governed by geochemical processes. This special issue of Environmental Science & Technology provides a panorama of current research on environmental and geochemical aspects of geologic carbon sequestration. It includes a feature article by the guest editors, and three critical reviews. The state of knowledge of caprock sealing mechanisms is examined in the first review, the second review evaluates how leakage may impact the geochemistry of aquifers and the vadose zone, and the third review explores the partitioning behavior of organic compounds in carbon sequestration environments. The reviews are followed by six papers on CO2 dissolution in brines and adsorption on minerals relevant to storage formations under geologic sequestration conditions. The focus then turns, through 14 papers, to CO2 interactions with three classes of minerals (carbonates, silicates, and aluminosilicates) when CO2 is injected and present in saturated brines. Next, five papers investigate physical-chemical processes involved with wetting phenomena, ganglion dynamics, viscous fingering, and CO2 trapping. Finally, ten contributions examine various processes relevant to the potential for leakage and transport out of storage zones, and to the monitoring of leakage. The coupling of chemical and physical processes is critical to the integrated assessment of GCS. The geochemical process studies presented in the special issue provide base-level science to inform the development and application of integrated performance assessment models for geologic carbon sequestration. In the U.S., the Department of Energy (DOE) has been developing one such modeling framework, CO2-PENS (Predicting Engineered Natural Systems), a comprehensive system-level computational modeling framework for performance assessment of geologic sequestration of CO2. CO2-PENS encompasses a (nonstatic) group of models that collectively enable probabilistic simulations of CO2 capture, transport, and injection in geologic reservoirs (Stauffer et al., Environ. Sci. Technol. 2009, 43(3):565\u2212570). Integrated performance assessment is the organizing framework for research being conducted by the U.S. DOE and other organizations around the world. To advance prospects for implementation of geologic carbon sequestration, it is important for research to be aligned with an integrated framework for analysis of performance and risk. Such focused research will yield an improved understanding of the technology in ways that matter to the public and to companies that will be charged with implementing a very much needed technology.

In actuality, many efforts to address GHG emissions combine a cap-and-trade system with other regulatory instruments. This raises an important question: What is the effect of combining a cap-and-trade policy with policies targeting specific technologies? To investigate this question I focus on how a renewable portfolio standard (RPS) interacts with a cap-and-trade policy. An RPS specifies a certain percentage of electricity that must come from renewable sources such as wind, solar, and biomass. I use a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, which is able to capture the economy-wide impacts of this combination of policies. I have represented renewables in this model in two ways. At lower penetration levels renewables are an imperfect substitute for other electricity generation technologies because of the variability of resources like wind and solar. At higher levels of penetration renewables are a higher-cost prefect substitute for other generation technologies, assuming that with the extra cost the variability of the resource can be managed through backup capacity, storage, long range transmissions and strong grid connections. To represent an RPS policy, the production of every kilowatt hour of electricity from non-renewable sources requires an input of a fraction of a kilowatt hour of electricity from renewable sources. The fraction is equal to the RPS target. I find that adding an RPS requiring 25 percent renewables by 2025 to a cap that reduces emissions by 80% below 1990 levels by 2050 increases the welfare cost of meeting such a cap by 27 percent over the life of the policy, while reducing the CO2-equivalent price by about 8 percent each year.

Several options for future CO2 capture from NGCC units can be envisaged including post-combustion capture technology using flue gas scrubbing with aqueous solvents. When an NGCC plant is designed to be ready for a retrofit with post-combustion capture, one of the most important technical considerations is the steam extraction pressure and flow to provide the energy necessary for solvent regeneration. This is determined by the choice of solvent used, but new solvents are being developed and the exact future requirements, in perhaps 10\u201320 years time, cannot be predicted. Ways in which designs for the steam cycle of NGCC plants can cope with this challenge are presented.

The most developed technology for the application is post combustion carbon capture using liquid solvents. However, due to very low concentration of CO2 in the gas turbine emitted flue gas, energy penalty caused by the capture process is relatively high. One of the methods to increase CO2 concentration is the recycling of flue gas (also termed as EGR) in which part of the flue gas is sent back to join the air stream entering the compressor. This paper presents results of an experimental campaign carried out at the Pilot Scale Advanced Capture Technology (PACT) facilities of the UK Carbon Capture and Storage Research Centre (UKCCSRC). A Turbec T100 microturbine of 100kWe is integrated with a post combustion carbon capture plant of 1TPD (Ton per day) CO2 capture capacity. The microturbine is very lean combustion system and produces a flue gas having only 1.5% CO2. Therefore, in order to simulate EGR on industrial gas turbines which produce around 4\u20135% CO2 in the exhaust stream, CO2 from a cryogenic storage tank was injected into the slip stream of the gas turbine exhaust. The impact of different CO2 concentrations (representing EGR) on the post combustion carbon capture process is experimentally evaluated. It is observed that the energy penalty caused by the capture process is considerably reduced at higher CO2 concentration in the absorber inlet flue gas stream. EGR also has a negative impact on the produced power from the gas turbine as well as the combustion process. However, it has positive impact on the power output from steam turbine. Optimum recycle ratio for maximum power output from combined cycle gas turbine is discussed. Performance of the absorption column as indicated by rich and lean solvent CO2 loadings is discussed. Moreover, emissions of solvent and some of the degradation products with the exhaust gas from the capture plant are monitored and reported.\u00a9 2015 ASME", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "5efd37053857968d9827a3f5a88e24d5d903bf91", "externalIds": {"MAG": "90563694", "CorpusId": 36350667}, "title": "Transition pathways for a low carbon energy system in the UK: assessing the compatibility of large-scale and small-scale options", "abstract": "This paper describes initial work on transition pathways for a low carbon energy system in the UK, being pursued in a major new research project.

Because of their strong hydrogen bonding, preadsorbed water molecules transport in the form of clusters and block the diffusion of methane, reducing the Onsager coefficient of methane dramatically compared to that in dry CNTs. The reduction in the methane Onsager coefficient is greater in narrower CNTs or at higher water densities. Because the diameter of the water clusters is almost invariant with water density, the Onsager coefficient of water in the (10, 10) CNT increases linearly with water density. It is further found that whereas decreasing the CNT diameter from 2.034 to 0.95 nm enhances the Onsager coefficient of pure methane by about 1 order of magnitude, the Onsager coefficient of water is almost independent of the CNT diameter at a water density of 0.05 g/cm3. We propose a theoretical model for the strong dependency of methane diffusion in wetted CNTs on the Onsager coefficient of water, the preadsorbed water density, and the CNT diameter. The model predicts the Onsager coefficients of the methane/water mixture from the Onsager coefficients of the pure components.

All the aforementioned approaches are based on various physical and chemical phenomena including absorption, adsorption, and cryogenic capture of CO2. The purified carbon dioxide is sent for the physical storage options afterwards, using the earth as a gigantic reservoir with unknown long\u2010term environmental impacts as well as possible hazards associated with that. Consequently, the ultimate solution for the CO2 sequestration is the chemical transformation of this stable molecule to useful products such as fuels (through, for example, Fischer\u2013Tropsch chemistry) or polymers (through successive copolymerization and chain growth). This sustainably reduces carbon emissions, taking full advantage of CO2\u2010derived chemical commodities, so\u2010called carbon capture and conversion.

ETIP researchers seek to identify and promote strategies that these countries can pursue, separately and collaboratively, for accelerating the development and deployment of advanced energy options that can reduce conventional air pollution, minimize future greenhouse-gas emissions, reduce dependence on oil, facilitate poverty alleviation, and promote economic development.

Executive Summary The transition towards more sustainable, low carbon societies will require the development and deployment of a range of new and existing energy technologies. These include centralised supply side options such as carbon capture and storage, infrastructure technologies such as decentralised energy networks, and technologies adopted by consumers such as LED lighting, cleaner vehicles and micro-generation. This paper analyses the role of governments in supporting this process and draws on experience from Europe, the USA and Japan. The paper's starting point is the common assertion that governments should avoid providing targeted support to particular technologies. Instead, they should set general frameworks to encourage more sustainable innovation, for example by creating carbon markets. The practice of 'picking winners' should therefore be avoided because governments are not best placed to decide which technologies to fund. 3 The paper challenges this argument on a number of grounds. First, the resources that governments can devote to sustainable energy innovation are limited. If there is no attempt to prioritise how these resources are used, there is a risk that they will be spread too thinly. Second, the urgency of climate change means that innovation and deployment may be too slow if there is an excessive reliance on the carbon market.

Researches focus either on the improvement of process flow scheme to maximize exergy integration or on characterization of new promising solvents to reduce this energy consumption. However, both aspects are often taken into account separately whereas they should be studied simultaneously since the energy efficiency of process modifications also depends on the considered solvent. In order to highlight this point, several schemes based on modifications proposed in literature are investigated for several classes of amine-based solvents and the total energy consumption is determined by a rigorous phenomenological model coupled with an optimization algorithm. Simulation results confirms that the efficiency of process modifications depends on the considered solvent since process improvements make use of the solvent specific properties, in particular the differences between thermodynamic and kinetic properties. General understandings are given on the relative efficiency of process modifications according to measurable solvent properties. Carbon dioxide capture and geological storage is foreseen to be one of the solutions to reduce the atmospheric emissions of fossil-fired power plants. Among the different technologies, post-combustion chemical absorption in amine-based solvents is the most mature at this stage of development. However, the energy consumption of such processes implies a large penalty on the power plant efficiency. The reference configuration used for chemical absorption of CO2 is a conventional absorption/desorption loop operating with monoethanolamine (MEA) where the CO2 is separated from the flue gas by chemical absorption in the solvent and the solvent is thermally regenerated in a stripper, sensible heat being exchanged in an economizer between the hot lean solvent and the cold rich solvent. The released CO2 is then compressed up to 110 bars at supercritical state for transportation and storage. For this base case, the energy requirement leads to a loss of around 11 %-pts in terms of power plant efficiency. In order to reduce this penalty, researches focus either on the improvement of process flow scheme to maximize heat integration or on characterization of new promising solvents. This work intends to emphasize the interaction between solvent properties and optimal process design and how both solvent characterization and process design should be carried out simultaneously, since the energy performance of a process modification is deeply dependent of the chosen solvent. In order to highlight this point, several schemes based on modifications proposed in literature are investigated for two classes of amine-based solvents. For each process flow scheme associated with each solvent, the operating parameters are optimized with respect to the total energy consumption with a dedicated algorithm using rigorous thermodynamic and rate-based models, which are mandatory for a proper representation of all limiting phenomena. By this means, the potential of each configuration is determined in terms of total energy penalty on the power plant.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "5a2436bae450b76a5d27af5b3c0ef2b2b2ebe217", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2330328002", "DOI": "10.1021/es5003764", "CorpusId": 26531439, "PubMed": "25187199"}, "title": "Siting is a constraint to realize environmental benefits from carbon capture and storage.", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) for coal power plants reduces onsite carbon dioxide emissions, but affects other air emissions on and offsite.

Geographical variability and stochastic uncertainty for 407 coal power plant locations in the U.S. are analyzed. The results show that the net environmental benefits and costs of MEA CCS depend critically on location. For a few favorable sites of both power plant and upstream processes, CCS realizes a net benefit (benefit-cost ratio >1) if the social cost of carbon exceeds $51/ton. For much of the U.S. however, the social cost of carbon must be much higher to realize net benefits from CCS, up to a maximum of $910/ton. While the social costs of carbon are uncertain, typical estimates are in the range of $32-220 per ton, much lower than the breakeven value for many potential CCS locations.

Unfamiliarity may, however, lead new entrants to openly question their applicability in order to transform their current understanding to a level where large capital investment can be organisationally justified. For example, some may make the erroneous assumption that a good CO2 subsurface store should resemble the pressure vessel type of containment that is prevalent with surface installations. Basic concepts such as utilising the rock structure and mineralogy to control fluid flow and securing the CO2 by residual trapping (between the rock grains) or by dissolution, as a superior storage mechanism, are counter intuitive and challenging to communicate effectively.\nTo achieve success and reliable operation in CO2 emission reduction for coal- and gas-burning electricity power generation, all elements of the CCS chain have to function.

Its research is aimed at development of workflows that describe a CCS entry path for a target audience of potential new entrants, i.e. power utilities, engineering sector and government.\nIn contrast to other studies, the CASSEM project has applied the specification of the full CCS chain, using two exemplar sites (coal-fired power plants) with contrasting geological conditions in the subsurface, to tailor storage site selection and analysis.\nCentred on the Ferrybridge Power Station in Yorkshire (Figure 1.1), a 'simple' site underlain by a thick, uniform sandstone with diverse legacy information available was sought onshore in the English Midlands.

This site was intended to confront the difficulties of investigating subsea structures with sparse legacy and incomplete information from hydrocarbon investigations.

Here, we estimate the system-level cost effectiveness of reducing CO2 emissions with flexible CCS compared to redispatching (i.e., substituting gas- for coal-fired electricity generation), wind, and normal CCS under the Clean Power Plan (CPP) and a hypothetical more stringent CO2 emission reduction target (\"stronger CPP\").

Two PEC systems, differentiated primarily by the extent of solar concentration (unconcentrated and 10\u00d7 concentrated) and two PV-E systems, differentiated by the degree of grid connectivity (unconnected and grid supplemented), were analyzed. In each case, a base-case system that used established designs and materials was compared to prospective systems that might be envisioned and developed in the future with the goal of achieving substantially lower overall system costs. With identical overall plant efficiencies of 9.8%, the unconcentrated PEC and non-grid connected PV-E system base-case capital expenses for the rated capacity of 3.65 kilotons H2 per year were $205 MM ($293 per m2 of solar collection area (mS\u22122), $14.7 WH2,P\u22121) and $260 MM ($371 mS\u22122, $18.8 WH2,P\u22121), respectively.

Likewise, the grid supplemented base-case PV-E system capital cost was $66 MM ($441 mS\u22122, $11.5 WH2,P\u22121), and with solar-to-hydrogen and grid electrolysis system efficiencies of 9.8% and 61%, respectively, the LCH was $6.1 kg\u22121. As a benchmark, a proton-exchange membrane (PEM) based grid-connected electrolysis system was analyzed. Assuming a system efficiency of 61% and a grid electricity cost of $0.07 kWh\u22121, the LCH was $5.5 kg\u22121. A sensitivity analysis indicated that, relative to the base-case, increases in the system efficiency could effect the greatest cost reductions for all systems, due to the areal dependencies of many of the components. The balance-of-systems (BoS) costs were the largest factor in differentiating the PEC and PV-E systems. No single or combination of technical advancements based on currently demonstrated technology can provide sufficient cost reductions to allow solar hydrogen to directly compete on a levelized cost basis with hydrogen produced from fossil energy. Specifically, a cost of CO2 greater than \u223c$800 (ton CO2)\u22121 was estimated to be necessary for base-case PEC hydrogen to reach price parity with hydrogen derived from steam reforming of methane priced at $12 GJ\u22121 ($1.39 (kg H2)\u22121). A comparison with low CO2 and CO2-neutral energy sources indicated that base-case PEC hydrogen is not currently cost-competitive with electrolysis using electricity supplied by nuclear power or from fossil-fuels in conjunction with carbon capture and storage. Solar electricity production and storage using either batteries or PEC hydrogen technologies are currently an order of magnitude greater in cost than electricity prices with no clear advantage to either battery or hydrogen storage as of yet. Significant advances in PEC technology performance and system cost reductions are necessary to enable cost-effective PEC-derived solar hydrogen for use in scalable grid-storage applications as well as for use as a chemical feedstock precursor to CO2-neutral high energy-density transportation fuels.

Therefore, risk assessment of CO2 transmission pipelines has been an important aspect for successful development of the CCUS industry in the future. Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is a group-based activity to prioritize risk.

One of the important options to design the pressurized oxy\u2010combustion is to determine method of coal (or other solid fuels) feeding: dry feeding or wet (coal slurry) feeding as well as grade of coals. The main aim of this research is to investigate effects of coal characteristics including wet or dry feeding on the performance of thermal power plant based on the pressurized oxy\u2010combustion with CO2 capture versus atmospheric oxy\u2010combustion. A commercial process simulation tool (gCCS: the general carbon capture and storage) was used to simulate and analyze an advanced ultra\u2010supercritical(A\u2010USC) coal power plant under pressurized and atmospheric oxy\u2010fuel conditions. The design concept is based on using pure oxygen as an oxidant in a pressurized system to maximize the heat recovery through process integration and to reduce the efficiency penalty because of compression and purification units. The results indicate that the pressurized case efficiency at 30 bars was greater than the atmospheric oxy\u2010fuel combustion (base line case) by 6.02% when using lignite coal firing. Similarly, efficiency improvements in the case of subbituminous and bituminous coals were around 3% and 2.61%, respectively.

By establishing the connection between higher concentrations of atmospheric CO2 and higher atmospheric temperatures, Arrhenius laid the foundation of modern climate-change research, which is dominated by the understanding that the steadily increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, caused mostly by fossil-fuel burning, is the main reason why the world's climate is warming so much and so rapidly. If too much CO2 in the air is the cause of our climate dilemma, then it seems obvious that we should slow down, stop, or even reverse its current rise to mitigate the risk of unwanted climate changes. Carbon capture and sequestration, or storage, (CCS) is rapidly becoming a key element in our nascent efforts to minimize the amount of CO2 we emit and perhaps even to regulate the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\nThis special issue aims to elucidate some of the main approaches to CCS and how they might be accomplished. In the Review, Haszeldine (p. [1647][2]) surveys efforts around the world to capture and store CO2 emitted by power plants, discussing both the technological challenges of carbon capture, transport, and storage and the political hurdles that remain to be overcome. Four Perspectives then highlight specific approaches to both CO2 capture and CO2 sequestration. Rochelle (p. [1652][3]) discusses how CO2 can be removed from the flue gas of power plants by the well-established technique of amine scrubbing, an especially important activity given the current reliance on coal. Keith (p. [1654][4]) presents ideas about removing CO2 directly from ambient air, one of the few approaches that offer the possibility of reducing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere on a time scale of decades. Orr (p. [1656][5]) discusses the current strategy of choice for sequestering captured CO2 permanently: the storage of CO2 in onshore geologic formations. Finally, Schrag (p. [1658][6]) argues for another promising but rarely discussed way to sequester CO2: through storage in offshore sediments.\n\nIn News, Dennis Normile (p. [1642][7]) offers a guide to the carbon cycle, a quick introduction to carbon sources and sinks, and a look back at how atmospheric CO2 has varied over the past 500 million years or so. Robert Service (p. [1644][8]) provides a map of major CCS projects around the world, showing mainly projects already in progress or under construction. Finally, Josh Fenn (p. [1646][9]) profiles two CCS projects in China which, though at early stages, are potentially important in a country with such a surging demand for fossil fuels.\n\nThe prospects of CCS are uncertain, but its promise is great. If this special issue has any single most important message, it is that there are abundant reasons to hope that CCS can be implemented effectively.\n\n [1]: pending:yes\n [2]: /lookup/volpage/325/1647?iss=5948\n [3]: /lookup/volpage/325/1652?iss=5948\n [4]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1175680\n [5]: /lookup/volpage/325/1656?iss=5948\n [6]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1175750\n [7]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.325_1642\n [8]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.325_1644\n [9]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.325_1646", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "c16fda1e15a4fd8abebbf918a405e39da936ad9e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2163031780", "DOI": "10.1890/12-2253.1", "CorpusId": 25796079, "PubMed": "24988770"}, "title": "Carbon storage landscapes of lowland Hawaii: the role of native and invasive species through space and time.", "abstract": "Tropical forests are important storehouses of carbon and biodiversity. In isolated island ecosystems such as the Hawaiian Islands, relative dominance of native and nonnative tree species may influence patterns of forest carbon stocks and biodiversity. We determined aboveground carbon density (ACD) across a matrix of lava flows differing in age, texture, and vegetation composition (i.e., native or nonnative dominated) in wet lowland forests of Hawaii Island. To do this at the large scales necessary to accurately capture the inherent heterogeneity of these forests, we collected LiDAR data across areas of interest and developed relationships between LiDAR metrics and field-based estimates of forest ACD. This approach enabled us to inventory, rather than merely sample, the entire populations (i.e., forests) of interest. Native Hawaiian wet lowland forests exhibited ACD values similar to those of intact tropical forests elsewhere. In general, ACD of these forests increased with increasing lava flow age, but patterns differed between native and nonnative forest stands. On the youngest lavas, native-dominated forest ACD averaged < 60 Mg/ha, compared to -100 Mg C/ha for nonnative-dominated forests. This difference was due to the presence of the nonnative, N2-fixing trees F. moluccana and C. equisetifolia in the nonnative-dominated forest stands, as well as the corresponding absence of N2-fixing trees in native-dominated forest stands. Following -500 years of primary succession and thereafter, however, both forest types exhibited ACD values averaging -130 Mg C/ha, although it took nonnative forests only 75 80 years of post-establishment succession to reach those values. Given the large areas of early-successional M. polymorpha-dominated forest on young lava flows, further spread of F. moluccana and C. equisetifolia populations would likely increase ACD stocks but would constitute a significant erosion of the invaluable contribution of Hawaii's native ecosystems to global biodiversity.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "6d5034983734cb104e0ec56f116f8a63565e4e39", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2042055040", "DOI": "10.1039/C5GC00129C", "CorpusId": 96369197}, "title": "Production of C3 platform chemicals from CO2 by genetically engineered cyanobacteria", "abstract": "Platform chemicals can be readily converted into various value-added chemicals and fuels.

With the rapidly falling cost of solar PV, wind power, and battery storage, industry electrification coupled with renewable electricity supply has the potential to be a key pathway to achieve industry decarbonization. This paper summarizes the latest research on the possibility of electrification of the industry sector. The transition to industry electrification would entail major changes in the energy system: large scale increases in renewable electricity or nuclear power supplies, the expansion of electricity transmission and distribution networks, completely different end-use technologies for process heating, and new infrastructure for distributing and dispensing hydrogen. Thus, aggressive and sustained supportive policies and much wider research, development, demonstration, and deployment activities are required to meet net zero carbon emissions goals in the industrial sector. Existing economically competitive electrified industrial processes (such as electric arc furnaces for secondary steelmaking from scrap steel), coupled with zero-carbon electricity sources can sharply reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) compared to manufacturing processes that rely on fossil fuels. Fuel switching in industry from fossil fuel\u2013based process heating to electrified heat can offer many product and productivity benefits, but operating costs in general are much higher than fossil fuel-based heating. Either much lower costs of electricity and energy storage are required and/or new, cost-competitive electric-technology applications are needed to enable further electrification of industry. Indirect electrification i.e., hydrogen production via water electrolysis is another complimentary technology reliant on electricity. Hydrogen can be used as an energy carrier, industrial feedstock for products and fuels, or for long-duration energy storage, and thus can also play a key role in industry decarbonization when the hydrogen is produced from zero-carbon electricity and/or with carbon capture and storage.

In the present work, we combine the high product yields and selectivities of CO(2) absorption processes with the advantages of membrane technology in a membrane contactor for the separation of CO(2) from CH(4) using amino acid salt solutions as competitive absorption liquid to alkanol amine solutions. Amino acids, such as sarcosine, have the same functionality as alkanol amines (e.g., monoethanolamine=MEA), but in contrast, they exhibit a better oxidative stability and resistance to degradation. In addition, they can be made nonvolatile by adding a salt functionality, which significantly reduces the liquid loss due to evaporation at elevated temperatures in the desorber. Membrane contactor experiments using CO(2)/CH(4) feed mixtures to evaluate the overall process performance, including a full absorption/desorption cycle show that even without a temperature difference between absorber and desorber, a CO(2)/CH(4) selectivity of over 70 can be easily achieved with the sarcosine salt solution as absorption liquid.

Each transport scenario considered both the pipeline transport and ship transport options. The temperature and pressure conditions of CO 2 in each transport stage were determined from engineering and economic viewpoints, and the corresponding specifications and equipment costs were calculated.

BECCS's ability to promptly remove CO2 from the atmosphere in a resource efficient manner, whilst being a net energy generator to the global economy, remains controversial. Given the large range of potential outcomes, it is crucial to understand how, if at all, this technology can be deployed in a way which minimises its impact on natural resources and ecosystems, while maximising both carbon removal and power generation. In this study, we present a series of thought experiments, using the Modelling and Optimisation of Negative Emissions Technologies (MONET) framework, to provide insight into the combinations of biomass feedstock, origin, land type, and transport route, to meet a given CO2 removal target. The optimal structure of an international BECCS supply chain was found to vary both quantitatively and qualitatively as the focus shifted from conserving water, land or biomass, to maximising energy generated, with the water use in particular increasing threefold in the land and biomass use minimisation scenario, as compared to the water minimisation scenario. In meeting regional targets, imported biomass was consistently chosen over indigenous biomass in the land and water minimisation scenarios, confirming the dominance of factors such as yield, electricity grid carbon intensity, and precipitation, over transport distance. A pareto-front analysis was performed and, in addition to highlighting the strong trade-offs between BECCS resource efficiency objectives, indicated the potential for tipping points. An analysis of the sensitivity to the availability of marginal land and agricultural residues showed that (1) the availability of agricultural residues had a great impact on BECCS land, and that (2) water use and land use change, two critical sustainability indicators for BECCS, were negatively correlated. Finally, we showed that maximising energy production increased water use and land use fivefold, and land use change by two orders of magnitude. It is therefore likely that an exclusive focus on energy generation and CO2 removal can result in negative consequences for the broader environment. In spite of these strong trade-offs however, it was found that BECCS could meet its electricity production objective without compromising estimated safe land use boundaries. Provided that the right choices are made along BECCS value chain, BECCS can be deployed in a way that both satisfies its resource efficiency and technical performance objectives.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "68d6e2d22f4c2b92088ae6005cdd48838bdf9342", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2796122868", "DOI": "10.1029/2012JD018122", "CorpusId": 134905249}, "title": "Sensitivity of net ecosystem exchange and heterotrophic respiration to parameterization uncertainty", "abstract": "We examine the uncertainty in net ecosystem exchange due to the model treatment of heterotrophic respiration in a variety of hydroclimatic conditions using a land surface model.

Imperatives and opportunities to reinvent agriculture by shifting from annual monocultures to perennial polycultures", "abstract": "Non-technical summary Modern agriculture is associated with numerous environmental predicaments, such as land degradation, water pollution, and greenhouse gas emission. Socio-economically, it is characterized by a treadmill of technological change, increased mechanization, and economic consolidation, while depressing economic returns to farmers. A root cause is the dominance of annual plants cultivated in monocultures. Annual crops require the yearly clearing of vegetation resulting in soil erosion and other forms of ecosystem degradation. Monocultures are susceptible to agricultural pests and weeds. By contrast, perennial polycultures informed by natural ecosystems, promise more sustainable agroecosystems with the potential to also revitalize the economic foundation of farming and hence rural societies. Technical summary Ten thousand years ago, humans begun domesticating wild annual plants to create the cereals and pulses that provide the mainstay of our food. The choice to domesticate annuals initiated the expansion of a novel and ecologically simple food-producing ecosystem, dependent on frequent and intense soil disturbances. Here we discuss the ecological, social and economic consequences of annual grain agriculture. In converting natural perennial ecosystems to annual crop monocultures for the provisioning of food, the ecosystems services of soil formation, nutrient retention, organic matter storage, pest suppression and others have been converted into the disservices of soil erosion, nutrient contamination, loss of organic carbon, and reliance on toxic agrochemicals. These processes are accelerated by increasing economic consolidation in agricultural industries and the relentless pursuit of economic efficiency, which has not only carried major consequences for the environment but also for the social fabric of rural societies. But a different agriculture is possible. We now have the technical capacity and ecological understanding to reinvent agriculture, so that it captures the key features of perenniality and diversity that characterize natural terrestrial ecosystems. Such a reinvention would also challenge the social and economic relations that uphold the current industrial model of agriculture.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "093eb977aec660504c63ef12e5e4b1c71129e6e5", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/candie/WangQ18", "MAG": "2808994122", "DOI": "10.1016/j.cie.2018.06.006", "CorpusId": 52070354}, "title": "When to invest in carbon capture and storage: A perspective of supply chain", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "f13fb3bc389d51fe280f865081bab364252fd8d8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1979004300", "DOI": "10.1021/EF100714C", "CorpusId": 93893259}, "title": "Investigation of the Oxy-fuel Gasification of Coal in a Laboratory-Scale Spouted-Bed Reactor: Reactor Modifications and Initial Results", "abstract": "Fluidized-bed gasifiers in combination with integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology are an efficient way to make use of low-value coal, waste, and biomass for power generation.

This paper analyses the EU\u2019s cumulative carbon emissions in different models and scenarios (global models, EU-focused models and national carbon mitigation scenarios).
