It is unfortunate that alternatives to underground storage have not been discussed and disseminated for public opinion. This presentation aims at demystifying the broader picture on carbon management and the associated issues. Given the current lack of progress on a large-scale carbon management, it is important to look at alternative carbon sequestration methods that carry less risk but may require further development work. In this context, carbon mineralization using a special chemical reaction approach that aims to solve two environmental problems in one solution has been studied. This approach stems from the fact that the GCC states produce fresh water from desalination processes and therefore reject huge amounts of concentrated brine into the sea and at the same time emit large amounts of CO2 from the massive hydrocarbon industries. These challenging environmental problems are the subject of a qatar national research fund project undertaken at Qatar University. The results obtained indicate that it is feasible to convert a significant amount of captured CO2 into a stable bicarbonate and at the same time reduce concentrated brine reject into the Arabian Gulf. Details of the proposed process will be presented. This is considered as a major contribution given the current status of the carbon conundrum.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "a75e639cef330a9791f0b25c8fbab6c3d24c9140", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2147253370", "DOI": "10.1149/ma2013-01/26/1016", "CorpusId": 98414546}, "title": "Hydrogen Evolution on Combustion Catalyzed Electrodes with Low Loadings for PEM Electrolyzers", "abstract": "Proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) is industrially important as a green source of high purity hydrogen both in chemical feedstock applications as well as in energy storage. The rapid response time of electrolyzers to power fluctuations; a compact footprint; reliability; cycle life; and no CO2 generation, when powered by renewable energy sources, make this technology ideal to capture generated electrical capacity that would otherwise be curtailed. Water based electrolyzers with lower heating value voltage efficiencies of 75% are projected to be able to produce H2 in the $34/kg range assuming reasonable electricity costs of $0.05/kW-hr [1]. Current PEM electrolyzer cost drivers are low volume manufacturing and high stack component costs; the current commercial units use >2 mg/cm of precious group metals (PGM) in both the anode (oxygen evolution reaction, OER) and cathode (hydrogen evolution reaction, HER). The O2 evolution at the anode suffers from large overpotential losses and durability issues that affect the efficiency and stability of this electrode. This electrode must endure high potentials (>2 V) and an acidic environment. Under these conditions carbon is easily oxidized and above 1.5V even un-alloyed noble metals such as Pt and Pd are corroded. Due to the high cost of the PGMs, which dominate electrolysis catalysis, a strategy of reduction through increased utilization and alloying is required. Extended surface area catalysts (i.e., 3M\u2019s NSTF platform) of PtIrRu and PtCoMn have been recently evaluated as a strategy to that employs both structure and alloying to reduce cost [2]. The Reactive Spray Deposition Technology (RSDT) approach is an ideal candidate for eliminating substantial direct MEA fabrication costs as well as indirect energy costs [3-6]. The RSDT route eliminates several process steps required in ink baseline processes and effectively combines catalyst synthesis, film formation, and support mixing into one step as shown in Figure 1.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "4f84ce544560f92b4c7a550bd3b822ffe69a2d9d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2347044124", "DOI": "10.7316/KHNES.2015.26.5.499", "CorpusId": 112963573}, "title": "Economical and Environmental Study on SNG Combined Cycle Integrated with CCS for Large-Scale Reduction of CO 2 (Based on NETL Report)", "abstract": "2 Hankuk University of Foreign Studies(HUFS), 107, Imun-ro, Dongdaemun-gu, Seoul, 02450, Korea Abstract >> Recently the Korean government announced its decision to select the 3 rd proposal, which targets reducing CO2 by 37% of the BAU level by 2030, for the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC). According to this proposal, natural gas (or equivalent gas) combined cycle (NGCC) are suggested as alternatives for conventional pulverized coal (PC). In this study, we analyzed the environmental, economic, and energy mixing aspects of synthetic natural gas combined cycle(SNGCC) using NETL material (2011~2012 version) and other domestic materials (2014 version).

However, 60% of CO2 from SNGCC is produced as high pressure and high purity (99%) gas, making it highly suitable for CCS, which is now strongly supported by the government. 2) Based on the economic analysis for SNGCC using domestic materials and comparison with NGCC, it was found that the settlement price of SNGCC was 30% lower than that of NGCC.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "ecd26e0d2d41ea5be83ae3ee2fd58e08c8228f7f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3015482402", "DOI": "10.29017/SCOG.51.2.69-74", "CorpusId": 216119505}, "title": "PROPOSED CO2 HYDRATE TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IMPLEMENTATION IN INDONESIA", "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Sequestration (0r Storage)\u2014known as CCS needs to be implemented in various development activities in Indonesia including downstream oil and gas industry because the government of Indonesia has adopted the Paris Agreement on Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction . Various capture techniques have been developed for capturing CO2 from post combustion emission. One of the new approaches considered for capturing CO2 and hence reducing to atmospheric emissions is based on gas hydrate (crystallization) technology. The basis of the technology is the selective partition of the target component between the hydrate phase and the gaseous phase. It is expected that CO2 is preferentially trapped and encaged into the hydrate crystal phase compared to the other components. Previous study found that the gas/hydrate equilibrium pressure and temperature for the fl ue gas mixture in the range of 7.6 MPa and 11.0 MPa at 274 K and 277 K respectively, are inappropriate to the downstream oil and gas industrial reality because the operating cost will be expensive to compress the gas to the hydrate formation pressure. Suitable hydrate promoters including Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) can be used to achieve moderate hydrate formation pressure and energy consumption appropriate to the industrial reality. In the presence of THF and SDS about 62.3 Nm3/m3 CO2 hydrate can be formed at 30 bar pressure and 274 to 277 K temperature within around 15 minutes reaction time.Many experiments result indicates that continuous hydrates formation will be feasible for scale-up to industrial settings including downstream oil and gas industry emission reduction if the technology assures an optimal contact between gas and liquid phases plus the proper hydrate promoter.

This makes it difficult to assess the greenhouse gas (GHG) consequences of different forest management or manufacturing activities that maintain the storage of carbon. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) addresses this issue by allowing other accounting methods. The objective of this paper is to provide a new model for estimating annual stock changes of carbon in harvested wood products (HWP).ResultsThe model, British Columbia Harvested Wood Products version 1 (BC-HWPv1), estimates carbon stocks and fluxes for wood harvested in BC from 1965 to 2065, based on new parameters on local manufacturing, updated and new information for North America on consumption and disposal of wood and paper products, and updated parameters on methane management at landfills in the USA. Based on model results, reporting on emissions as they occur would substantially lower BC\u2019s greenhouse gas inventory in 2010 from 48 Mt CO2 to 26 Mt CO2 because of the long-term forest carbon storage in-use and in the non-degradable material in landfills. In addition, if offset projects created under BC\u2019s protocol reported 100\u2009year cumulative emissions using the BC-HWPv1 the emissions would be lower by about 11%.ConclusionsThis research showed that the IPCC default methods overestimate the emissions North America wood products.

The evaluation is done from two perspectives: techno-economic analysis, and analysis of the resource and integration potentials. Included technologies for reducing CO2 are biomass and concentrating solar power (CSP), integrated with the CCGT, as well as application of post-combustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) to the gas plant. The techno-economic analysis is based on technical options and methodology presented in three papers (Papers I, II and IV) and these options are in the thesis compared with a harmonized methodology. European potentials for integration with existing CCGT plants are assessed in the thesis by complementing database information for gas plants with solar irradiation data and satellite images. An analysis of the global material constraints of CSP is included, based on results from Paper III, and complemented with an oversight of material issues for biomass power and CCS. In addition, the thesis includes an oversight of global and European resource potentials of biomass power, CSP and CCS, based on literature review. \nOne main conclusion of the thesis is that there are potential efficiency and cost benefits of integrating biomass and solar energy with existing natural gas-fired power plants. Solar and biomass options are both found to give up to 8-13%-points better efficiency when integrated with a triple pressure CCGT plant, than corresponding stand-alone configuration. CCS in gas plants is found to have the lowest levelized cost of electricity, LCoE (60-80 EUR/MWh), compared to biomass-based options (80-140 EUR/MWh) and stand-alone solar (>200 EUR/MWh). Biomass-gas hybrids are, however, found to be competitive with CCS options in terms of CB-E, break-even cost of CO2. Integrating CSP collectors with combined cycle plants will reduce the LCoE to almost half that of stand-alone plants (~130 EUR/MWh), nearly closing the gap to where CSP can be competitive with other low-carbon technologies. \nThe total economic potential for biomass power is found to be about 1,000-3,000 TWhe/y in the EU. Comparable figures for CSP are 2,000-3,000 TWhe/y. The EU CO2 storage capacity is sufficient to facilitate more than 3,000 TWhe/y from natural gas CCS over a 100 year period. The European integration potential with CCGT plants is estimated to about 240 TWhe/y for biomass and 2-4 TWhe/y for concentrating solar.

L. Bragg, the holographic method as we know it was invented by D. Gabor in 1948 as a two-step lensless imaging technique to enhance the resolution of electron microscopy, for which he received the 1971 Nobel Prize in physics. The distinctive feature of holography is the recording of the object phase variations that carry the depth information, which is lost in conventional phot4bg,j'aphy where only the intensity (= squared amplitude) distribution of an object is captured. Since all photosensitive media necessarily respond to the intensity incident upon them, an ingenious way had to be found to convert object phase into intensity variations, and Gabor achieved this by introducing a coherent reference wave along with the object wave during exposure. Gabor's in-line recording scheme, however, required the object in question to be largely transmissive, and could provide only marginal image quality due to unwanted terms simultaneously reconstructed along with the desired wavefront. Further handicapped by the lack of a strong coherent light source, optical holography thus seemed fated to remain just another scientific curiosity, until the field was revolutionized in the early 1960s by some major breakthroughs: the proposition (A. L. Schawlow and C. H. Townes) and demonstration (T. H. Maiman) of the laser principle, the introduction of off-axis holography (E. Leith and J. Upatnieks), and the invention of volume holography (Y. N. Denisyuk). Consequently, the remainder of that decade saw an exponential growth in research on theory, practice, and applications of holography. Today, holography not only boasts a wide variety of scientific and technical applications (e.g., holographic interferometry for strain, vibration, and flow analysis, microscopy and high-resolution imagery, imaging through distorting media, optical interconnects, holographic optical elements, optical neural networks, three-dimensional displays, data storage, etc.), but has become a prominent art, advertising, and security medium as well. The evolution of holographic optical memories has followed a path not altogether different from holography itself, with several cycles of alternating interest over the past four decades. P. J. van Heerden is widely credited for being the first to elucidate the principles behind holographic data storage in a 1963 paper, predicting bit storage densities on the order of I/Z 3 with source wavelength ,,1.a fantastic capacity of nearly I TB/cm _ for visible light! The science and engineering of such a storage paradigm was heavily pursued thereafter, resulting in many novel hologram multiplexing techniques for dense data storage, as well as important advances in holographic recording materials. Ultimately, however, the lack of such enabling technologies as compact laser sources and highperformance optical data I/O devices dampened the hopes for the development of a commercial product. After a period of relative dormancy, successful applications of holography in other arenas sparked a renewed interest in holographic data storage in the late 1980s and the early 1990s.

Doctor\u2019s Thesis \u2013 Graduate Program on Energy, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, 2015. The intense using of fossil fuels on worldwide scale, with their massive greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, makes energy the greatest anthropogenic cause of climate change. Petroleum is and will remain, in the long term, the most used energy source and the second greatest emitter of GHG of the world. With the goal of mitigating climate changes, three major worldwide strategies are being applied: energy efficiency, increase using of renewable sources and carbon capture and storage (CCS). Recent studies show that, by enhanced oil recovery (EOR), with miscible injection of CO2 (miscible CO2-EOR), it is possible to store geologically up to 320 Gt of CO2, producing, at the same time, a trillion of additional oil barrels, globally. CO2-EOR, already used for 40 years in order to increase oil recovery, has also becomes the CCS method with the greatest global potential of geological carbon storage. This work aims to investigate the contribution of the petroleum energy system to mitigate climate change, with a greater efficiency in its recovery (optimizing the utilization of energy deposits available in the biosphere) at the same time that it allows the capture and geological storage of CO2 in the reservoir. EOR-CO2 is an effective means for carbon storage. With its capability to store 85 Mt of CO2 per year, it is already responsible for 58% of all carbon geosequestration in the world. In the Americas, reaches 91 %. EOR-CO2 increases oil production, in the order of hundreds billions barrels, and transforms the oil energy system in a carbon sink with a new and important role in climate change mitigation.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "2042b2d7b64a15a7ea2a70e8f8eda33218e10daf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2796012766", "CorpusId": 131797452}, "title": "Supporting the further development of Carbon Capture and Storage in Scotland", "abstract": "On 29 January 2013 the Scottish Government published Low Carbon Scotland: Meeting our Emissions Reduction Targets 2013-2027.

Therefore, understanding the phase transition of various Ca- and Mg-bearing minerals in strong or mild acidic solutions is of vital importance for SS-based CCUS.

Barker Jr., Kishore A. Narayana, Susan A. Odom. Odom Group, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY, 40508 Carbon-based anodes are commonly used in lithium-ion batteries due to their low volume expansion, high energy density, and long cycling life. Extensive research has been devoted to understanding and developing existing anode materials for lithium-ion batteries. Graphite has a highly conductive conjugated covalent structure, a high energy density of around 72.9 MJ/L, and a theoretical specific capacity of 372 mAh/g. Filler materials are used to increase electrical conductivity between particles of the active material. In this project, graphitic-based anodes with various filler materials were prepared for testing in full-cell and half-cell batteries to test the capacities and lifetimes of anodes with different filler materials. Electrodes were prepared by mixing mesocarbon microbead (MCMB) graphite as the active material, various graphitic fillers, and a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder in an 8:1:1 ratio by weight. Slurries of anode materials in the organic solvents NMP and THF (3:7) were spray coated onto copper current collectors to produce anode films, which were dried in a vacuum oven overnight at 100 \u00b0C. Coin-cell batteries were assembled in an argon-filled glove box and cycled on a battery cycler for at least 10 cycles at a rate of C/10. The cycling results are plotted on graphs of capacity vs. cycle number for comparison. Averages and standard deviations of the capacity for each similar battery type were calculated at certain cycles as well as the percent of initial capacity retained at the last cycle. Cycling results show a large standard deviation for most batteries with percent retention mostly in the 65-90% range. 1 \u2610 Freshman \u2610 Sophomore \u2610 Junior X Senior DINUCLEAR RUTHENIUM COMPLEXES SHOW INCREASED LIGHT ACTIVATED DNA DAMAGE Sam Beavin, Erin Wachter, Prof. Edith Glazer. University of Kentucky, Department of Chemistry, Lexington, KY 40506. Current photodynamic therapy for treatment of cancer uses photosensitizing agents activated by visible to near -IR light to produce cytotoxic singlet oxygen. Oxygen-independent mechanisms can result from using strained metal complexes that covalently bind DNA when activated by light. By introducing two ruthenium centers on the same pro-drug, more effective DNA damage can be achieved. Two novel dinuclear ruthenium complexes have been synthesized and interactions with plasmid DNA characterized. Visible light activation of these compounds produces significantly more damage to plasmid DNA then the mononuclear analogs, indicating that this approach may offer an efficient route to induce DNA damage in cancer cells. 2 \u2610 Freshman \u2610 Sophomore X Junior \u2610 Senior ANALYSIS OF THE EFFECT OF PATHLENGTH ON SMALL VOLUME REACTIONS USING THYMINE AND SODIUM PERMANGANATE Jonathan Brigham, Stephen Testa PhD. Department of Chemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40506. Single stranded deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing is often time-consuming and expensive. Nevertheless, through experimentation, it has been shown that different DNA bases react slightly differently with sodium permanganate. The resulting color change may give clues to less expensive DNA identification and sequencing techniques. Previous work in our lab has developed a colorimetric technique to provide sequence and structural information. One of the challenges of this technique has been the relatively large sample of DNA that must be used. My goal is to analyze the way that the volume of the solution affects color in different types of solution vessels with the hopes of being able to simultaneously run a greater number of reactions at extremely small volumes reducing costs and making the process more efficient. In this experiment, the reaction of sodium permanganate and thymine was done in a 96 well microplate and in capillary tubes. Analysis of the results indicated that there is a way to reduce the scale of the reaction to extremely small volumes without the loss of richness in color. 3 \u2610 Freshman \u2610 Sophomore X Junior \u2610 Senior CARBONIC ANHYDRASE MIMICS FOR CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE Rachael Burrows, Sean Parkin, Cameron Lippert, Joe Remias, Kunlei Liu, Susan Odom. University of Kentucky, Department of Chemistry, Lexington, KY 40506. Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide warm the Earth by containing radiation from the sun within the lower atmosphere. Increasing concerns of global climate change have led to the development of new technologies to decrease anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. A major source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emission is the combustion of carbon-based fuels such as coal. Carbon dioxide capture and sequestration significantly decrease the emission of greenhouse gases. The current method of CO2 capture in industrial settings utilizes aqueous solutions of monoethanolamine, MEA. My research project seeks to increase the efficiency of CO2 capture from flue gases utilizing catalyst mimics of the biological enzyme, carbonic anhydrase. The current state-of-the-art catalyst, Zn-Cyclen, is reported to have a second order rate constant of 2000 M-1s1. The focus of this research is the synthesis and characterization of a new zinc catalyst, CAER-C2, which I synthesized on a multi-gram scale from the reaction of zinc chloride with a previously reported ligand. The crystalline product was characterized by x-ray crystallography, which shows that it forms a coordination complex that includes three unique zinc atoms in the unit cell, and further testing (mass spectrometry) shows that this complex remains intact in solution. This catalyst has a rate constant for CO2 capture that is approximately two orders of magnitude higher than Zn-Cyclen. This increased activity may have grand implications for the future of carbon capture in industrial settings by increasing the efficiency of CO2 capture and lowering costs. If power plants capture CO2 with better efficiency, greenhouse gas emission into the atmosphere will decrease and reduce the threat of future climate change. 4 \u2610 Freshman \u2610 Sophomore \u2610 Junior X Senior EXAMINING OXIDATIVE DAMAGE TO DNA WITH VARIOUS FREE RADICAL SYSTEMS Brittany Buurman, Dr. Jason DeRouchey. University of Kentucky, Department of Chemistry, Lexington, KY 40506. Oxidative damage to DNA from reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a common type of damage faced by cells that contributes significantly to carcinogenesis, cellular aging, and genomic instabilities. The production of reactive oxygen species is the consequence of normal body processes such as metabolism but can also arise from toxic sources such as radiation. High rates of oxidative damage to DNA in sperm chromatin have also been linked to infertility in males as well as higher rates of genetic disease in the offspring. In sperm chromatin, the general consensus is that tight packing of DNA in sperm nuclei is necessary to limit DNA damage due to ROS since DNA repair is absent. We hypothesize that protamine chemistries resulting in less efficient packaging, allows increased accessibility of free radical species to the compacted DNA. Accessibility is not only matter of sterics but also physical chemical interactions. As a first step, agarose gels and fluorescence studies were used to qualitatively assess damage to pUC19 plasmid DNA by different free radical sources including Fenton reagents, 2,2\u2019-azobis(2-amidino-propane) dihydrochloride (AAPH), and N-Nitrosomorpholine (NMOR). For AAPH, comparisons were made between free radical damage to DNA in free solution and protamine packaged DNA. Our long-term goal is to determine quantitatively the interrelationship between DNA packaging densities and the resulting accessibility of DNA to reactive oxygen species (ROS). 5 \u2610 Freshman \u2610 Sophomore \u2610 Junior X Senior USE OF BIOCHEMICAL AND GENETIC APPROACHES TO SEARCH FOR ANCESTORS OF MAMMALIAN MANNOLIPID FLIPPASES Stephanie Carpenter, Dr. H. P. Spielmann, C. J. Waechter, J. Rush. University of Kentucky, Department of Chemistry, Lexington, KY 40506. Flippases, a termed originally suggested by Mark Bretscher in 1974, are membrane proteins that play a vital role in membrane biology. Flippases overcome the biophysical barrier, which is imposed by the bilayer common to cellular membrane via the bilayer\u2019s hydrophobic core. Flippases facilitate transbilayer movement of the polar head groups of phospholipids and glycolipids. Flippases play a crucial role in the expansion of the bilayer in a uniform manner throughout membrane biogenesis, as well as maintaining and establishing the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids, which reside in the cellular membranes. Flippases are also a crucial component of the transbilayer movement of glycolipid intermediates in the dolichol pathway, which accounts for protein N-glycosylation, Cand O-mannosylation of proteins, biosynthesis of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors, the formation of complex glycosphingolipids and cell wall components in yeast and Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The topological model (Figure 1) accounts for the assembly of lipomannan, an acidic, branched polymannose chain, which contains 48-50 mannose residues. The mannose residues are attached to the hydroxyl group at position-3 of diacylglycerol (DAG) in M. luteus. In this assembly, GDP-Man acts as the direct mannosyl donor for two mannosyltransferases, catalyzing the biosynthesis of Man1-2-diacylglycerol (Man1-2-DAG). The biosynthesis occurs on the inner face of the cytoplasmic membrane (Figure 1, steps 1,2). Man-Pundecaprenol (Man-P-Undec(C55)) is formed via a mannosyltransferase catalyzing the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose (GDP-Man) to un", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "c349023462812d023bdfaabc9e03b75f8f7446c8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2610895243", "CorpusId": 55426445}, "title": "Economic modeling of the CO2 transportation phase and its application to the Duero Basin, Spain", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage is a viable option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

To stay consistent with the long-term temperature targets of international climate policy, global greenhouse gas emissions have to reach zero within a few decades. Such a dramatic transition towards sustainability in all sectors of human activity requires the decarbonization of power generation at an early stage. In absence of other viable technology choices and given the significant cost declines, renewable power generation forms the backbone of the decarbonization. In contrast to thermal power plants, most renewables are not dispatchable but their generation dynamics are governed by the weather. \n \nThis dissertation adds to the quantification of impacts of climate variability on wind power generation on different time scales. In particular, it shows that inter-annual wind power generation variability already today has a strong influence on congestion management costs in Germany. Understanding this variability as a normal system feature helps to prevent short-sighted reactions in legislation and power system design. Moreover, it is shown that relevant multi-decadal wind power generation variability exists. Owing to timescales of up to 50 years, these modes are not sufficiently sampled in any modern reanalysis (e.g., MERRA2 or ERA-Interim), which currently cover around 40 years. Consequently, power system assessments based on modern reanalyses may be flawed and should be complemented by multi-decadal assessments. In this context, I also show that 20th century reanalyses (ERA-20C, CERA20C, 20CRv2c) disagree strongly and systematically with respect to long-term wind speed trends. The discrepancy can be traced back to marine wind speed observations which also feature strong upward wind trends that are likely due to an evolving measurement technique. As a consequence, 20th century reanalyses should be employed with care and cross-validation of results is recommended. \n \nDue to their weather dependency, renewables are potentially vulnerable to climate change. Indeed, I show that the benefits of large-scale transmission infrastructure in Europe shrink under strong climate change (RCP8.5). The effect is robust across a five member EUROCORDEX ensemble and can be solidified in a larger CMIP5 ensemble. It is rooted in more homogeneous wind conditions over Europe that lead to less smoothing effects via large scale spatial integration. \n \nLastly, the debate around negative emission technologies to enlarge the carbon budget currently focuses on land-based approaches such as Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage.

In particular, it is imperative to make a breakthrough in the utilization of marine carbon sinks/reservoirs (accounting for more than 93% of the earth's natural carbon sinks/reservoirs) as soon as possible. Recent actual surveys and studies of several long-running large and medium-sized Eurasian power plants (a total of about 12 GW (Gigawatt), including a refinery and a marine tanker), have found that these commercial scale seawater scrubbing flue gas desulfurization (FGD) projects have captured substantially more CO2 than SO2 into the marine water column.

This is remarkable in that conjoint methods can be excellent tools for examining the combined influence of factors that contribute to effective communication. Research shows that effective communication messages should be congruent, stressing the importance of the interactions between elements in the communicated messages. Current studies on this topic often ignore the interactions and focus on variation within a single factor. We propose that a more inclusive application of conjoint methods in communication studies can be valuable, and provide an example of such an application. We specifically focus on communication about Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The term \u201cCCS\u201d encompasses a combination of technologies used to capture CO2 at an electric plant, transport it to a depleted gas field, and store it indefinitely. CCS can play a valuable role in mitigating climate change, yet public acceptance remains low. This may be attributable to poor knowledge and awareness of the technology. Properly communicating about CCS to the general public may alleviate this problem.\u00a0 While the content of the proposed communication is not yet clear, its existence may help by improving knowledge and awareness surrounding the issue. Method We examined the effect of different arguments on respondents\u2019 self-reported persuasiveness (i.e. in the form of a choice) of a communication message. We also determined whether there was a change in attitude due the experiment. In each choice task, respondents chose between two arguments. The arguments were presented as unlabeled alternatives that varied on one attribute; the content of the argument. We conducted an online survey with 900 respondents. The respondents were divided into two groups. One group read exclusively pro arguments; another group read exclusively con arguments. Some additional questions were included that measured knowledge on CCS, attitude on climate change and several socio-demographic factors. The choices were analyzed first with a MNL model and later with LC models. Results We found that normative pro and con arguments (i.e. arguments that appeal to social norms) are most persuasive. Furthermore, arguments that appeal to fear or discuss the economic aspects of CCS are most persuasive for particular clusters. The change in attitude significantly differs between the two groups; it changes significantly in the negative direction for the group that read con arguments,\u00a0 and changes significantly in the positive direction for the group that read pro arguments The use of choice models has enabled us to assess a large number of arguments (32) conjointly. This attests to the value of choice models in communication studies. Further research should increase the number of attributes investigated in more extensive experimental designs and expand the scope beyond mere arguments; to full messages.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "31082990e916048562830bbf03213ac0dd5cf00b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3027265118", "DOI": "10.1071/aj19107", "CorpusId": 219439353}, "title": "The Lesueur Formation storage complex in South Western Australia: safe, secure long-term storage of CO2", "abstract": "\nCarbon capture, utilisation and storage remain critical components of a decarbonised future.

Meeting CO2 reduction targets is challenging, since carbon is inherent in the dominating production route in blast furnaces. Long-term plans to phase out carbon and change production technique are under way, such as iron ore reduction with hydrogen[1][2] won from renewable energies or electro winning[3], however unlikely to be implemented at scale before 2040 [4]. Until a transition to such technologies is completed, carbon leakage will remain to be a threat to steel industry inside EU ETS system. CCS remains an option for steel industry to comply with reduction targets and meet rising allowance (EUA) prices, currently above 20 \u20ac/t. Most studies on CCS propose a capture rate of \u2265 90 %[5\u20137], however, CCS could be considered as a part of a series of measures (e.g. fuel change, energy efficiency measures) that together achieve a significant reduction in CO2 emissions until a carbon-neutral production is in place. This line of thought motivates the concept of partial capture, where only the most cost effective part of the CO2 emissions are separated for storage [8]. In steel industry, high CO2 concentrations at large flows and the availability of excess heat make partial capture attractive. Previous work on the steel mill in Lulea, Sweden, emits around 3.1 Mt CO2 per year, has found that 40-45 % of site emissions can be captured fueled by excess heat alone[9]. Therein, five heat recovery technologies were assessed, ranging from back pressure operation of CHP turbine to dry slag granulation. Promising CO2 sources on site include flue gases from hot stoves and the combined-heat and power plant, and the process gas originating from the blast furnace \u2013 blast furnace gas (BFG). BFG is a pressurized, low value fuel used for heating on site. CO2 separation from BFG requires less reboiler heat for MEA regeneration, and the enhanced heating value of the CO2 lean BFG increases energy efficiency of the steel mill [9]. This work discusses the near-term (the 2020s) implementation of partial capture at a Swedish steel mill and the economic viability of such implementation dependent on the energy price, carbon price, and required reductions in CO2 emissions. Based on previous work [9][10,11] on partial capture in steel industry a cost estimation of a capture system for the BFG is conducted including CAPEX and OPEX of the MEA capture unit, gas piping, and recovering heat from the steel mill. The costs are summarized as equivalent annualized capture cost (EAC) and set into relation to transport and storage costs as well as carbon emission costs to form the net abatement cost (NAC) according to Eq. (1) \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc36=\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc34\ud835\udc36+ \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc61&\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61 \u2212\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc52 [\u20ac/\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc422] (1) Figure 1 shows how EAC for BFG varies with the capture rate and the cost of steam for different heat recovery technologies represented by the steps in the curve ( see explanation in [9]). Note that partial capture from BFG is more economical than the full capture benchmark. The most cost-efficient case of 28 \u20ac/t CO2 captured is achieved for BFG capture fueled by steam from back-pressure operation (at the expense of electricity production), flue gas heat recovery and flare gas combustion. The transport and storage cost applied in Eq (1) represent ship transport from the Bothnian Bay to a storage site in the Baltic Sea , according to Kjarstad et el.[12]. Transport and storage cost range within 17 \u2013 27 \u20ac/t CO2 depending on scale. These installation and operation cost for capture, transport and storage are set into relation with various scenarios on future carbon and energy (electricity) prices in Europe and Sweden. For example, Figure 2 illustrates a scenario in line with IEA\u2019s sustainable development scenario to restrict global warming to 2\u00b0C. The carbon prices are adapted from WEO 2018 [13] and increase from 20 \u20ac to 120 \u20ac per tonne CO2 by 2040 and the electricity prices of 42-52 \u20ac/MWh (increasing with time) are based on latest results from the NEPP project [14]. In this scenario, partial capture from BFG could become economic viable in 2029, construction in 2020 with operation from 2022/23 onwards is likely to pay off within a lifetime of 20 years only. This work demonstrates the viability of partial capture as cost-efficient mitigation measure for the steel industry and illustrates conditions for an early implementation in the 2020s.

The role of energy technologies is considered crucial in climate change mitigation. In particular, carbon capture and storage (CCS) promises to allow for lowemissions fossil-fuel based power generation. The technology is under development; a number of technological, economic, environmental and safety issues remain to be solved. With regard to its sustainability impact, CCS raises a number of questions: On the one hand, CCS may prolong the prevailing coal-to-electricity regime and countervail efforts in other mitigation categories. On the other hand, given the indisputable need to continue using fossil fuels for some time, it may serve as a bridging technology towards a sustainable energy future. In this paper, we discuss the relevant issues for the case of Germany. We provide a survey of the current state of the art of CCS and activities, and perform an energy-environmenteconomic analysis using a general equilibrium model for Germany. The model analyzes the impact of introducing carbon constraints with respect to the deployment of CCS, to the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, to the energy and technology mix and with respect to interaction of different mitigation efforts. The results show the relative importance of the components in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. For example, under the assumption of a CO2 policy, both energy efficiency and CCS will contribute to climate gas mitigation. A given climate target can be achieved at lower marginal costs when the option of CCS is included. We conclude that, given an appropriate legal and policy framework, CCS, energy efficiency and some other mitigation efforts are complementary measures and should form part of a broad mix of measures required for a successful CO2 mitigation strategy. a The discussion paper reports on a case study within the research program on \u201cTransformation and Innovation in Power Systems\u201d (www.tips-project.de).

The ocean takes up 93\u2009% of the excess heat in the climate system and approximately a quarter of the anthropogenic carbon via air-sea fluxes. Ocean ventilation and subduction are key processes that regulate the transport of water (and associated properties) from the surface mixed layer, which is in contact with the atmosphere, to the ocean's interior which is isolated from the atmosphere for a timescale set by the large-scale circulation. Using numerical simulations with an ocean-sea-ice model using the NEMO framework, we assess where the ocean subducts water and thus takes up properties from the atmosphere and how ocean currents transport and redistribute them over time and how, where and when they are ventilated. Here, the strength and patterns of the net uptake of water and associated properties are analysed by including simulated sea water vintage dyes that are passive tracers released annually into the ocean surface layers between 1958 and 2017. The dyes' distribution is shown to capture years of strong and weak convection at deep and mode water formation sites in both hemispheres, especially when compared to observations in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre. Using this approach, relevant to any passive tracer in the ocean, we can evaluate the regional and depth distribution of the tracers, and determine their variability on interannual to multidecadal timescales. We highlight the key role of variations in subduction rate driven by changes in surface atmospheric forcing in setting the different sizes of the long-term inventory of the dyes released in different years and the evolution of their distribution. This suggests forecasting potential for determining how the distribution of passive tracers will evolve, from having prior knowledge of the surface air-sea fluxes, with implications for the uptake and storage of anthropogenic heat and carbon in the ocean.\n", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "32c046dc7b05836e97e75e2e020bda4920b64e7a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2325236040", "DOI": "10.1126/SCIENCE.350.6267.1487-D", "CorpusId": 138315935}, "title": "Store more energy with a touch of nitrogen", "abstract": "Energy Storage\nIn contrast to batteries, capacitors typically can store less power, but they can capture and release that power much more quickly.

It concludes that the global energy system can meet the challenge of a strong climate policy, with carbon prices up to 100 \u20ac/tCO2, through a mix of options. In the power sector, penetration of renewable and nuclear technologies up to 50% combined with the deployment of CO2 capture and storage can result in emission reductions up to 40%. Similarly, in Europe, CO2 emissions can be reduced with 21% 54% in 2050. The contribution of coal remains uncertain, as it depends on the estimates for costs and potential for CCS. Secondly, the implications of high oil and gas prices are not necessarily environmentally favourable, as there is a tendency towards coal, even though renewables also benefit. The additional effect of enhanced technological progress is strongest in the transport sector, where it can stimulate hydrogen, but also biofuels, to reduce the dominance of petroleum-based automotive fuels.

In this work, previous studies of geological carbon storage are reviewed, redefined, and evaluated to focus on providing proper candidate storage sites in the Southern San Joaquin Basin. This study clarifies not only the CO2 capture and storage opportunity but also the potential economic benefit. A three-stage selection method is applied to a catalog of saline formations and hydrocarbon fields to qualify sites for additional in-depth study. The three stages consist of screening using geological criteria, defining exclusion zones, and qualifying sites (Callas and Benson, 2020; Kim et al., 2022). Exclusion zones define potentially unacceptable storage sites based on seismic risk, surface environment such as sensitive habitats, social, and economic aspects. Nine saline formations and 133 hydrocarbon fields were examined. The exclusion zones including faulted, seismically active, large population density, restricted lands, and sensitive habitats, were subtracted from hydrocarbon fields and saline formations. This process resulted in qualified sites. Finally, qualified sites were prioritized using a scoring system. The estimated CO2 storage resource in the qualified saline formations ranged from 16.6 to 52 GtCO2 whereas the estimated CO2 storage resource in hydrocarbon fields ranged from 0.45 - 1.15 GtCO2. Among hydrocarbon fields, 15 CO2-EOR candidate fields with storage resources of 0.36 \u2013 0.88 GtCO2 are located in Kern County. Considering the scoring system, a total of 41 storage sites including 7 hydrocarbon fields were defined as target CO2 storage sites. The opportunities for 41 CO2 storage sites in and around Kern County were linked to selected large CO2 emitters in Southern California including Imperial, Kern, Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, and Ventura Counties. Finally, the prospective storage sites and emitters were analyzed technoeconomically using SimCCS to find optimal conditions to deploy CCS projects. Regional GHG emissions from oil and gas facilities such as EOR steam generators and CHPs can be captured and stored economically in geological formations as a result of LCFS and 45Q credits. The sensitivity of 45Q credit value and covered period are critical factors to incentivize CCS deployment.

This is remarkable in that conjoint methods can be excellent tools for examining the combined influence of factors that contribute to effective communication. Research shows that effective communication messages should be congruent, stressing the importance of the interactions between elements in the communicated messages. Current studies on this topic often ignore the interactions and focus on variation within a single factor. We propose that a more inclusive application of conjoint methods in communication studies can be valuable, and provide an example of such an application. We specifically focus on communication about Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The term \u201cCCS\u201d encompasses a combination of technologies used to capture CO2 at an electric plant, transport it to a depleted gas field, and store it indefinitely. CCS can play a valuable role in mitigating climate change, yet public acceptance remains low. This may be attributable to poor knowledge and awareness of the technology. Properly communicating about CCS to the general public may alleviate this problem. While the content of the proposed communication is not yet clear, its existence may help by improving knowledge and awareness surrounding the issue. Method We examined the effect of different arguments on respondents\u2019 self-reported persuasiveness (i.e. in the form of a choice) of a communication message. We also determined whether there was a change in attitude due the experiment. In each choice task, respondents chose between two arguments. The arguments were presented as unlabeled alternatives that varied among three attributes: the content of the argument, the framing of the argument and the source of the argument. We conducted an online survey with 1200 respondents. The respondents were divided into three groups. One group read exclusively pro arguments, another group read exclusively con arguments and a last group read both. Some additional questions were included that measured knowledge on CCS, opinion leadership, social trust, attitude on climate change and several socio-demographic factors. The choices were analyzed first with a MNL model and later with LC models. Results We found that con arguments, normative arguments (i.e. arguments that appeal to social norms), arguments from scientists and arguments that contain an extensive explanation of the argument are most persuasive. The change in attitude is significant and significantly differs between all experimental groups. The change was largest in the group that read only con arguments. Although the change in attitude was smaller in the group that read both pro and con arguments, attitude still changed in a negative direction. This provides additional support for the finding that con arguments are more persuasive. The use of choice models has enabled us to assess several elements of a communication message conjointly and to test the interactions between these elements. This attests to the value of choice models in communication studies. Further research should increase the number of attributes investigated in more extensive experimental designs and expand the scope beyond mere arguments; to full messages.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "c1967260dffc08da2f2d92b460537d9ca4d242bb", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.34133/2021/9798714", "CorpusId": 244766816}, "title": "Biological Parts for Plant Biodesign to Enhance Land-Based Carbon Dioxide Removal", "abstract": "A grand challenge facing society is climate change caused mainly by rising CO2 concentration in Earth\u2019s atmosphere. Terrestrial plants are linchpins in global carbon cycling, with a unique capability of capturing CO2 via photosynthesis and translocating captured carbon to stems, roots, and soils for long-term storage. However, many researchers postulate that existing land plants cannot meet the ambitious requirement for CO2 removal to mitigate climate change in the future due to low photosynthetic efficiency, limited carbon allocation for long-term storage, and low suitability for the bioeconomy. To address these limitations, there is an urgent need for genetic improvement of existing plants or construction of novel plant systems through biosystems design (or biodesign). Here, we summarize validated biological parts (e.g., protein-encoding genes and noncoding RNAs) for biological engineering of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) traits in terrestrial plants to accelerate land-based decarbonization in bioenergy plantations and agricultural settings and promote a vibrant bioeconomy. Specifically, we first summarize the framework of plant-based CDR (e.g., CO2 capture, translocation, storage, and conversion to value-added products).

CCS can be used for large point source emissions of CO2, like power plants using fossil fuels, where it removes CO2 from the flue gases. This is most commonly done through the use of chemical absorption of CO2 in an amine solvent called monoethanoloamine (MEA). After the absorption the solvent is regenerated and the captured CO2 is released in a stripping column, a process which is both expensive and energy consuming. The energy used for the regeneration reduces the output from the power plants imposing an energy penalty of up to almost 30%. Reducing the energy requirement in the carbon capture process is crucial in order to make CCS commercially viable, and one possible way to do this is to use so-called phase changing solvents. This new family of molecules are amines that in the presence of water and CO2 exhibit a triple phase vapour-liquid-liquid equilibrium. The liquid mixture separates into two liquid phases where one has a high CO2 and amine content while the other phase consists mainly of water. The two liquids can be separated without the addition of energy in a decanter so that only a part of the flow is sent to the stripper. This opens up new possibilities for the design of absorption/desorption flowsheets for solvent based CCS that may reduce the total energy requirement of the process. Creating flowsheets that can be used for future reference and identifying important aspects and challenges of simulating CCS processes with phase-changing solvents is of importance. Apart from this the aim of this project is to achieve a regeneration energy requirement below 2.0 GJ/tonne CO2 captured and reduce the operating cost by 80% compared to an MEA reference process. The project consisted of three parts where the first part was a literature study to identify and select solvents that exhibit the desired phase changing properties followed by property estimation of these solvents in Aspen Plus\u00ae. The estimated properties were also validated using reference values. Secondly, different flowsheets were created identifying different layout possibilities and a sensitivity analysis was performed investigating the impact of the biggest uncertainties in assumptions made as well as differences in operating conditions. The third part was an economic and environmental assessment of the process and a comparison with an MEA reference process.

Work at the South African Research Chairs Initiatives (SARChI), Chair in Carbon Materials and Technology at the University of Pretoria is aimed at developing materials from cheap, local carbon sources for solar thermal applications. The focus is split on developing composites for both solar energy capture and thermal energy storage. Preliminary investigations are based on systems designed to provide heating needs like hot water through solar energy. Two different approaches to the capture of solar energy were explored. Firstly the use of carbon black and expanded graphite pressed discs and secondly the production of mesophase based graphitic foams. The carbon black discs demonstrated the ability to reach a peak collector temperature of around 70 \u00b0C whilst providing approximately 4 kW.hr per m 2 per day. The foam with the best capture had an efficiency calculated at around 95%. This is based on measured incoming radiation converted into sensible heating of the water. Phase change materials present an efficient and innovative solution to the problem of thermal energy storage. These materials suffer from a major drawback due to their low thermal conductivity. Two alternatives were explored for enhancing this property. Firstly the direct incorporation of phase change material into expanded graphite was tested. A variety of loadings were explored. It was found that at low concentrations of 6 mass % the time required for the sample to undergo the phase transition could be reduced by 70% for heating and 85% for cooling.

Dissertation supervised by Professor Peter Swart. No. of pages in text. (205) Economic growth since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution has been unprecedented and improved the lives of billions, though not without a cost. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions have perturbed the global carbon cycle, driving rapid climate change that is forecasted to be economically devastating to many regions while exterminating delicate ecosystems and countless species. Despite the unappealing political and economic impacts of halting fossil fuel consumption, an immediate answer is truly needed. To stave off these disastrous outcomes requires a rapid response to greenhouse gas emissions that future technologies, no matter how promising, are not yet ready to engage. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage is a unique technological approach that minimally tempers economic growth while squelching carbon emissions. The technology to inject and store carbon in deep reservoirs has been tested and developed for decades, but for widespread implementation comprehensive monitoring frameworks are required to ensure the projects are economically and environmentally effective, as well as safe for surrounding surface communities. In this dissertation, a new optical approach to isotope ratio analysis, cavity ringdown spectroscopy, is vetted to ensure it has the requisite analytical performance and is optimized for long-term monitoring deployment. Background biological activity that may mask leakage signals is examined in the context of local geography, meteorology, and hydrology to best constrain background noise. In the first extended field test of its kind, a statistical scheme is developed that exceeds modeled signal-to-noise ratios by nearly an order of magnitude. When injection activity is initiated, it is possible to compare current to background values and track how injection alters the soil gas and atmospheric CO2 systems. The sampling array can directionally locate the source of this new carbon and estimate the rate of release we observe. This singular data set informs how monitoring should proceed at present and future sites to ensure carbon sequestration actualizes its full potential as prototype for unified environmental and economic progress.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "948ba61acd4f6f6cb2077e92ac8b4989bd25af41", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 14722446}, "title": "Assessing early investments in carbon capture and storage technology under uncertainty", "abstract": "We investigate whether the existence of learning-by-doing and significant future uncertainties create circumstances where early investment in coal-fired power with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) creates an option values for society, when broader greenhouse gas emissions policies are applied. A decision analytic framework is constructed using results from the MIT Emissions Prediction Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. The decision examined is whether to invest $5 billion annually in coal with CCS technology, and the uncertainties modeled are the stringency of the future US greenhouse gas emissions policy, the size of the US natural gas resource, and the nth-of-a-kind levelized cost of electricity from coal with CCS. We measure the cost to society for every scenario as economic welfare and perform sensitivity analysis on the probabilities of each uncertainty to determine the conditions under which society benefits from early investments in CCS and option values exist. We find that the net present value cost (using a 4% discount rate) to society of meeting a prescribed emissions policy could increase by up to $1.9 trillion or decrease by up to $2.4 trillion over a 100-year period by investing in CCS today. We find that the three uncertainties have different relative impacts on the early investment decision. The amount of natural gas resource has the smallest effect, while the stringency of the emissions policy is the most influential. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus, this research analyses the technical and economic feasibility of using calcium leached from cow bone to capture and store carbon dioxide through the mineral carbonation process. The capturing process of carbon dioxide was successful using the proposed technique of leaching calcium from cow shinbone (the tibia) in the presence of HCl by reacting the calcium solution with gaseous carbon dioxide. AAS and XRF analysis were used to determine the concentration of calcium in leached solutions and the composition of calcium in cow bone respectively. The best leaching conditions were found to be 4\u2009mole/L HCl and leaching time of 6\u2009h. Under these conditions, a leaching efficiency of 91% and a calcium conversion of 83% in the carbonation reaction were obtained. Other factors such as carbonation time, agitation rate, and carbonation reaction temperature had little effect on the yield. A preliminary cost analysis showed that the cost to capture 1\u2009ton of CO2 with the proposed technique is about US$ 268.32, which is in the acceptable range of the capturing process.

Although these methods have been employed in some application, each method has its own limitions in the application on shale reservoir evaluation. First, micropore in shale are observed by various types of high resolution scanning electron microscopes, pores diameter are differ from each operator and only small area of sample can be observed ; Measurement error is produced when pores diameter are measured applied NAM,because the organic matter and clay minerals can adsorpt a amount of nitrogen, mercury porosimetry method is suitable for measuring connected mesopores and macropores, either, shale pore diameter is distributed in the nanometer scale, excessive mercury pressure may bring about induced fracture ,which influence measured value(Xu et al., 2014; Bai et al., 2013).

Generally, the content of organic carbon(TOC) decreases along with the content of silica expect for biogenic silica shale. As we know, hydrocarbon can be stored in organic matter nanopore in shale, hydrocarbon saturation of Eagle Ford shale increased along with TOC Increasing; Meanwhile, biogenic silica could transform into quartz(Qin et al., 2010), which could increased brittleness of Eagle Ford shale. Pyrite were observed in scanner images of JY2HF shale, which was regarded as paleoredox proxy(Raiswell R et al., 1985). Many of the trace metal elements showed variation in the redox status of the depositional environment, redox-sensitive trace metals trend to be soluble under oxidizing conditions and less soluable under reducing conditions, this behavior makes certain trace metals to be delivered to sediment and organic matters, such as U and Ni(Nicolas Tribovillard et al.,2006).

The trace element redox proxy Th/U ratio was 0.67-2.6, Ni/Co value was 3.55-14.44, which recorded strongly reducingweakly oxidating conditions, The TOC and pyrite presented consistent with variation of redox from the bottom of Longmaxi formation . In the Tianba section in northeastern Chongqing Wufeng period and early stages of the Longmaxi period showed low biological productivity, but a great deal of organic matters were preserved in strongly reducing conditions. by contrast, higher biological productivity was observed in the late stage of the Longmaxi period, more organic matters experienced oxidation and decomposition since the content of dissolved oxygen increased(Xiong et al., 2015).

Moreover, as non-annex 1 country, Indonesia shows strong and bold commitment in supporting reduction on increased concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities such as burning the fossil fuels and deforestation. From the energy sector, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is known as a process of capturing waste carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources and depositing it normally at an underground geological formation. CCS becomes now as one of the possible supports to the country commitment. In Indonesia, the potential of CCS applications could be conducted in the gas fields with high content of CO2 and in almost depleted oil fields (by applying CO2-Enchanced Oil Recovery (EOR) The CCS approach could also be conducted in order to increase hydrocarbon production, and at the same time the produced CO2 will be injected and storage it back to the earth. Thus, CCS is a mitigation process in enhancing carbon emission reduction caused by green house effect from production hydrocarbon fields. This paper will show a proposed milestone on CCS Research roadmap, as steps to be taken in reaching the objective. The milestone consists of the study for identifying potential CO2 sources, evaluating CO2 storage sites, detail study related to CO2 storage selection, CO2 injection, and CO2 injection monitoring. Through these five steps, one can expect to be able to comprehend road map of CCS Research. Through this research milestone, applications of CCS should also be conducted based on the regulatory coverage milestone. From this paper, it is hoped that one can understand the upstream activities starting with research milestone to the very end downstream activities regarding to the regulation coverage bound.\u00a0 Keywords : CCS, reduction of carbon emission, regulation umbrella", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "5aa3e1e60587973885b9888135b32ee779aa880e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2316029933", "CorpusId": 112427542}, "title": "COMMERCIALIZATION OF AN ATMOSPHERIC IRON-BASED CDCL PROCESS FOR POWER PRODUCTION. PHASE I: TECHNOECONOMIC ANALYSIS", "abstract": "Coal Direct Chemical Looping (CDCL) is an advanced oxy-combustion technology that has potential to enable substantial reductions in the cost and energy penalty associated with carbon dioxide (CO2) capture from coal-fired power plants. Through collaborative efforts, the Babcock & Wilcox Power Generation Group (B&W) and The Ohio State University (OSU) developed a conceptual design for a 550 MWe (net) supercritical CDCL power plant with greater than 90% CO2 capture and compression. Process simulations were completed to enable an initial assessment of its technical performance. A cost estimate was developed following DOE\u2019s guidelines as outlined in NETL\u2019s report \u201cQuality Guidelines for Energy System Studies: Cost Estimation Methodology for NETL Assessments of Power Plant Performance\u201d, (2011/1455). The cost of electricity for the CDCL plant without CO2 Transportation and Storage cost resulted in $ $102.67 per MWh, which corresponds to a 26.8 % increase in cost of electricity (COE) when compared to an air-fired pulverized-coal supercritical power plant. The cost of electricity is strongly depending on the total plant cost and cost of the oxygen carrier particles. The CDCL process could capture further potential savings by increasing the performance of the particles and reducing the plant size. During the techno-economic analysis, the teammore\u00a0\u00bb identified technology and engineering gaps that need to be closed to bring the technology to commercialization. The technology gaps were focused in five critical areas: (i) moving bed reducer reactor, (ii) fluidized bed combustor, (iii) particle riser, (iv) oxygen-carrier particle properties, and (v) process operation. The key technology gaps are related to particle performance, particle manufacturing cost, and the operation of the reducer reactor. These technology gaps are to be addressed during Phase II of project. The project team is proposing additional lab testing to be completed on the particle and a 3MWth pilot facility be built to evaluate the reducer reactor performance among other aspects of the technology. A Phase II proposal was prepared and submitted to DOE. The project team proposed a three year program in Phase II. Year 1 includes lab testing and particle development work aimed at improving the chemical and mechanical properties of the oxygen carrier particle. In parallel, B&W will design the 3MWt pilot plant. Any improvements to the particle performance discovered in year 1 that would impact the design of the pilot will be incorporated into the final design. Year 2 will focus on procurement of materials and equipment, and construction of the pilot plant. Year 3 will include, commissioning, start-up, and testing in the pilot. Phase I work was successfully completed and a design and operating philosophy for a 550 MWe commercial scale coal-direct chemical looping power plant was developed.

One of the promising methods is the use of carbon mineralization as a CCS methodology. For this approach, some minerals can be investigated, such as wollastonite, which can be obtained from agricultural waste recovery. One topic of interest in these studies is agriculture, demonstrating that it can play an important role in climate change mitigation.

Achieving a low carbon future requires a new approach to providing energy solutions. This paper reviews the advancements in CCUS technology and actions of the oil and gas industry actively participating in Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS). CCUS has been identified to play a key role in achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\n Oil and gas industry has been using CO2 Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) for many years which removes some CO2 permanently from the atmosphere. Currently there are more than 150 CO2 EOR projects in place worldwide. Additionally, the major oil and gas companies are stepping up to further remove CO2 from the environment through Direct Air Capture (DAC), Carbonate Fuel Cells etc.\n This paper discusses a few of the CCUS projects undertaken by some major oil and gas companies. Many companies are investing in startups, national research institutes and other ventures with proven viable technologies for carbon capture such as DAC and fuel cell technology. It is too early to say which of these technologies will emerge as the most superior one. Therefore, investing in different technologies and continuing with the established practices is the more fitting approach. The recent changes in 45Q tax credit in the USA is going to entice even more investors to approach CCUS as a commercially attractive venture.\n There is currently a lot of pressure from government and public to minimize CO2 emission in all industries and this will only increase with time. Oil and Gas industry is investing heavily on CCUS projects and are therefore best equipped to transition to carbon management companies.

The energy required by the absorption process resulted in a ~30% de-rate in the generating station output. 14,000 tonnes/day of pure CO2 captured and compressed from the boiler was transported and injected into a saline aquifer approximately 125 km from the generating station and at least 800 m beneath the earth\u2019s surface under supercritical conditions, (31.1\u00b0C, 7.38 MPa). The cost to transfer CO2 from the boiler and inject it underground is ~10 US$/tonne of CO2. The extension from a single boiler to the entire fleet of generating stations was formulated as an MILP and implemented in GAMS. A 3% fleet-wide reduction in CO2 emissions was achieved by fuel-balancing alone.

Typically, the battery limit of interface between the subsurface and surface engineer is the surface ITHP whereby the initial prediction was based on stand-alone sub-surface well modelling.

Depending on the process or power plant application, three main approaches to capturing the CO2 generated from a primary fossil fuel (coal, natural gas or oil), biomass, or mixtures of these fuels are presently considered: Post-combustion capture systems, Pre-combustion capture systems and Oxyfuel combustion capture systems. The production of SO2 or H2S as unintended and potentially dangerous by-products is also considered. While existing CO2 pipelines in U.S.A. with predominantly relatively pure CO2 streams are running generally through sparsely populated areas, CO2 pipelines from projected fossil-fuelled power plants containing H2S and SO2 as \u2018impurities\u2019 may need to cross densely populated areas, for instance in Western Europe. The availability of reliable calculation methods for the most relevant CO2 properties (density and viscosity), for the influence estimation of impurity concentrations on phase behavior and calculation methods for determination of the optimum technoeconomic pipeline diameter, are therefore a pre-requirement for a safe, environmentfriendly and economic pipeline design. A potential new pipeline route has to be examined within the frame of a risk analysis to identify hypothetical hazard scenarios and to estimate potential consequences with regard to severity and estimated frequency. The examination covers the hypothetical case of leakage, evaluates the time-dependent CO2 leak rate (source term), estimates the CO2 outflow / jet formation in the immediate vicinity of the leak, and estimates the dispersion of cold CO2 clouds depending on atmospheric and topographic conditions like hilly terrain, depressions and big buildings. The integrated approach which is partially an iterative process starts with the investigation of a suitable route avoiding exposed areas and close proximity to inhabited areas, under consideration of the special CO2 and impurity related properties and local conditions.

These measures will be completed by integrated procedures and training measures for the pipeline operators and by pipeline maintenance measures including running of so-called intelligent pigs.

However, CO2 capture is a bottleneck where efforts have to be applied in order to develop technically and economically available processes. Monoethanolamine (MEA) is described as a well know absorption liquid for the chemical absorption of CO2 and its use in combination with a membrane device is being studied in the recent literature [2,3] because of the number of advantages of membrane processes [4]. However, the volatile character of MEA produces solvent losses due to their evaporation into the gas stream. Thus, the use of solvents with lower vapour pressure such as ionic liquids as absorption liquids may contribute to the performance of a zero solvent emission process.
