The application of BECCS in pulp mills has been found technically feasible in earlier studies. This study explores key factors that affect the propensity to invest in BECCS in different types of existing European pulp and paper mills.

Based on statistical data, the marginal carbon dioxide credit (\u20ac per ton CO 2 ) to make BECCS profitable was derived. The results show that the required level of credit greatly depends on the mill type and details and that the feasibility of BECCS does not clearly correlate with the economic performance or the measured efficiency of the mill. The most promising mill type, a market kraft pulp mill, would find BECCS profitable with a credit in the range of 62\u201370 \u20ac/t CO2 and a credit of 80 \u20ac/t CO2 would decrease pulp production costs by 15 \u20ac/t product on average if 50% of CO 2 emissions was captured.

However, exiting methods to estimate CO2 storage capacity are all based on the material balance theory. This was absolutely correct for normal reservoirs. However, as natural fractures widely exist in tight oil reservoirs and majority of them are vertical ones, tight oil reservoirs are not close. Therefore, material balance theory is not adaptive.

The CO2 effective storage capacity, in this new method, consisted of free CO2, CO2 dissolved in oil and CO2 dissolved in water. Case studies of tight oil reservoir from Ordos Basin was conducted and it was found that due to far lower viscosity of CO2 and larger solubility in oil, CO2 could flow in tight oil reservoirs more easily. As a result, injecting CO2 in tight oil reservoirs could obviously enhance sweep efficiency by 24.5% and oil recovery efficiency by 7.5%.

A core need is an understanding and quantification of background environmental variability in relation to the likelihood of detection from putative release. Unmanned surface vehicle (USV) technology is rapidly evolving, with a number of USV platforms available that can meet a variety of needs in ocean observing. Advanced sensor technologies integrated on USVs promise coverage and flexibility for sustained observations at space and time scales not previously achievable. This paper describes CSIRO research with USVs in support of CCS environmental monitoring studies in Australia. \n \nCSIRO utilises a range of autonomous systems, including autonomous underwater vehicles, remotely operated vehicles and robotic profiling floats as part of its observing capabilities. For CCS studies, CSIRO is partnering with Saildrone Inc. to provide a flexible platform that houses a suite of sensors for environmental assessments at offshore CCS sites. The Saildrone platforms have been designed to accommodate sensors for detection of three important monitoring types: seawater carbon dioxide, bubble acoustics and water quality. The Saildrones can be used for long-range reconnaissance in a broad range of sea conditions and with up to 6-month deployment durations. Each Saildrone platform and its science systems can be operated remotely, with data transmitted back to shore via satellite to allow real-time monitoring of changes in the marine environment. The rapid deployment and response of the platform allows for more detailed investigation of features identified during surveys and of anomalies that exceed the known variability in measured variables. The combination of the platform with fixed measurements, such as those collected using more traditional oceanographic moorings, provides new capability to assess variability at CCS sites over a larger survey area than has been possible before. \n \nThe sensor systems fitted to the Saildrone and the land based calibration and maintenance support facilities are state of the art. The carbon sensor suite delivers pH, pCO2 and dissolved oxygen. It is based on a robust system proven to work in the field over long periods and includes reference gas and transmission of multiple diagnostic parameters to ensure sensor performance and calibrations are maintained. The acoustic sensors use a two-frequency split beam system operating at 38 kHz and 2002 kHz that can detect low concentrations of bubbles in the water column. It will be possible to detect and monitor potential or reported bubble plumes over time to determine the cause. In this way reducing false alarms where under certain circumstances aggregations of fish or zooplankton can be mistakenly interpreted as a bubble plume. Sensors for sub-surface bio-optics to assess water column plankton (chlorophyll and particle backscatter), oceanographic (temperature and salinity) and meteorological data are also incorporated into the real-time data streams delivered from the Saildrone. This paper will provide an overview of the sensor configuration and performance capabilities of the USVs for use in environmental assessments to support CCS.

During my tenure, I argued that universities must be centers of scholarship that contribute to the sum total of human wisdom on a level that transcends disciplinary distinctions, such as between science and the humanities. Toward that end, I fought for increases in research spending and improvements to the research and education facilities at Japan\u2019s universities, which were in poor condition at the time. In 1995, the Japanese government implemented the Basic Law on Science and Technology and followed up in 1996 with the Science and Technology Basic Plan. This plan, which is revised every 5 years, has helped spur a dramatic increase in competitive funding and other outlays for science and technology research. Even so, research and education in Japan still face many problems. First of all, funding for the humanities and social sciences is far too meager. If we are to contribute to the advancement of humanity, we must encourage the balanced development of both the hard sciences and the humanities, for which the latter area in particular requires more investment. Second, funding remains woefully insufficient for education on all levels\u2014primary, secondary, and higher. From the standpoint of long-term policy for our nation, substantive improvement in this area should be a major priority for Japan. The University of Tokyo, like other universities, has recently seen criticism aimed at the \u2018reductionist\u2019 fragmentation of academic disciplines, with many voices calling for a merging of the sciences and humanities. While I strongly advocate balanced development in both areas, I personally consider it impossible for any one individual to master the entire spectrum of knowledge. Therefore, I think it is unrealistic to expect all students and researchers to gain a comprehensive knowledge of both the sciences and humanities. What I do hope is that scholars in either area will acquire a certain degree of familiarity with the other. At universities, this can be achieved by requiring a minor as well as a major of students. For this same reason, is it not unrealistic to envision a generation of sustainable development \u2018specialists\u2019 whose perspective simultaneously encompasses the entire field? What research for sustainable development demands is, if anything, increasingly specialized work by experts in such fields as energy, food, and water; however, they must also be capable of collaborating in the overall effort to solve global environmental problems. What is important here is that the specialists in these diverse fields expand their perspective beyond their particular area of expertise enough to create a cooperative framework for combating these global environmental problems together. To pick one example, the energy field alone requires specialists in thermal power, nuclear power, new energy sources, energy conservation, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and so on. It also needs experts with an interest in the mixing of energy sources, as well as social scientists to aid in such tasks as the diplomatic negotiations required to achieve a balance of national interests in the resolution of global energy issues.

This method has been criticized for the inability to appropriately address emissions timing and the focus on a single impact metric, which may lead to inaccurate or incomplete quantification of the climate impact of bioenergy production. In this study, we introduce Dynamic Relative Climate Impact (DRCI) curves, a novel approach to visualize and quantify the climate impact of bioenergy systems over time. The DRCI approach offers the flexibility to analyze system performance for different value judgments regarding the impact category (e.g., emissions, radiative forcing, and temperature change), equivalency metric, and analytical time horizon. The DRCI curves constructed for fourteen bioenergy systems illustrate how value judgments affect the merit order of bioenergy systems, because they alter the importance of one\u2010time (associated with land use change emissions) versus sustained (associated with carbon debt or foregone sequestration) emission fluxes and short\u2010 versus long\u2010lived climate forcers. Best practices for bioenergy production (irrespective of value judgments) include high feedstock yields, high conversion efficiencies, and the application of carbon capture and storage. Furthermore, this study provides examples of production contexts in which the risk of land use change emissions, carbon debt, or foregone sequestration can be mitigated. For example, the risk of indirect land use change emissions can be mitigated by accompanying bioenergy production with increasing agricultural yields.

A major consideration is given to geological sequestration: capture of CO2 followed by injection and permanent storage in underground geological formations like aquifers, coal mines and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. Enhanced oil recovery (EOR) by CO2 injection is an attractive sequestration option, since (1) the process has been commercially used since 1970s and its features are well known, (2) a part of CO2 sequestration costs in this case is offset by the value of additional oil produced.

In (future) use of anthropogenic CO2 captured at point sources, the sequestration issue changes the approach to CO2 project design, since the objective is to increase retention of CO2 while maintaining acceptable level of additional oil recovery. This paper compares the results of simulation runs which were part of the original reservoir study aimed at investigating the incremental oil recovery due to CO2 flooding to the results of subsequent runs designed to increase CO2 retention during the flooding.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "06c155cafea8b5063328d5c03a8c6e4e8e030e1e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2564531954", "DOI": "10.1109/ICIEV.2016.7759975", "CorpusId": 22917997}, "title": "2D multi-gas mapper with cascading module system along with wireless sensor network", "abstract": "Now-a-days, the release of hazardous gases is one of the major threat not only for the environment but also for climate and lives.

There are a number of sources for gas emission, like; exhaust gases from industry as well as traffic, fires flue gases, waste disposals, various incidents at the chemicals geo-dynamically active regions, Carbon Capture Storage (CCS) areas, gases over industrial sites, landfill sites, and contaminated areas. In these cases, a quickly localization of gas leaks as well as monitoring the potential areas of gas emission are necessary. In our research work, we proposed an approach to integrate various 2D multi-gas distribution mapping with various cascade-able modules placed in a bus logic design over a wired and wireless based sensor network. Though all the modules are cascade-able and placed in a line with common bus designed into the system, so it is possible to add or remove any number of modules at any time. For every single gas we predefined a particular gas intensity threshold as PPM (Parts Per Millions) into the main controller for every module. With the compare of present sensor values and the predefined values, our system can able to track the significant change over gas adsorption and also the scale level of its derogative. With the presumption of a hazardous situation over gas distribution, we also proposed an adapting process of generating alarms. These alarm generating processes works over two basis; one is live alarm that for the local area and another is distance alarm that generated in a particular connection device for the system administrator. In our work, we focus on the measurement of 2D multi-gas consent ration by using versatile gas sensors, then locate the level of gas emission with alarm generating process at the case of hazardous situations.

Within various CCUS routes available, CO2 conversion into fuels is one of the attractive options. Currently, most of CO2 conversion into fuels requires hydrogen, which is expensive and consume large energy to produce. Hence, a different route of producing fuel from CO2 by utilizing 1,4\u2010butanediol as the raw material is proposed and evaluated in this study. This alternative route comprises production of levulinic acid from the reaction between CO2 and 1,4\u2010butanediol and production of ethyl levulinate, an alternative biofuel and biofuel additive, via an esterification reaction of levulinic acid with ethanol. The process is designed and simulated according to the available data and evaluated in terms of its technical features. Because of the unavailability of reaction data for synthesis of levulinic acid from 1,4\u2010butanediol and CO2, several assumptions were taken, which may implicate the accuracy of the studied design. This technical evaluation is followed by cost estimations and sensitivity analysis. Because of the free CO2, the profitability of the plant depends strongly on the prices of the other chemicals and the price difference between 1,4\u2010butanediol (raw material) and ethyl levulinate (product). Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the proposed plant will always be profitable if the ethyl levulinate is slightly more expensive than the 1,4\u2010butanediol, highlighting that the process of producing ethyl levulinate from CO2 is economically profitable.

As a proactive measure, scientists are developing new techniques to reduce CO2 emission to the atmosphere. Carbon capture and long time storage is a relatively new concept even though it is not economically feasible. Hence scientists have now focused on CO2 capture technology utilising salt water alga. In the present study, CO2 capturing rates of salt water algal plants Ulva fasciata , Caulerpa racemosa , Sargassum cervicone , Chaetomorpha spp , Padina spp , Corallina spp and Gracilaria spp . which are found in the ocean surrounding Sri Lanka were measured. However, it is very difficult to mimic the natural physical conditions inside the laboratory. Therefore an attempt was made to capture CO2 using an aquatic plant found in fresh water. Hydrilla verticella is an aquatic, invasive plant to Sri Lanka with a high growth rate. The CO2 capturing rate of Hydrilla verticella was compared with other salt water algal plants. When carrying out the experiment for salt water algae, the initial pH was reduced to 5 by pumping CO2 in to a fixed volume of salt water and then 30g of the specimen was placed and the variation of pH was measured with time. A Similar procedure was carried out with Hydrilla verticella by pumping CO2 in to distilled water. A control was kept under similar conditions without the specimen for each case. Ulva fasciata showed highest CO2 capture rate and Hydrilla verticella was second best. Hydrilla verticella was chosen as it is easy to manipulate for this study. The graph plotted between pH and time for Hydrilla verticella exhibited a typical photosynthetic pattern found in other plants. In this research, main parameters that have been investigated were on the salinity of the medium and the photoperiod to enhance the CO2 capture rate of Hydrilla verticella . Different salinity levels were obtained by adding different quantities of NaCl (10, 20, 30 \u2026.70 g) in to one liter of distilled water. Results showed that this plant is adaptable to very different levels of salinity but the optimum salinity range is 10-20 gdm-3. Photoperiod was determined by exposing the samples to sun light over varying periods (0, 4, 8, 12 hrs) of time. Results showed that maximum activity was seen when exposed to 12 hrs of sunlight yet it is interesting to note that it can capture CO2 even under very low light intensities; even during night time when other plants respirate. CO2 capturing rate was the highest when the pH of the medium was in between 5-7. The concept of carbon credits came into existence as a result of increasing awareness of the need for controlling green house emissions.

However, the higher capital costs and concerns about reliability and availability of IGCC plant have limited their market penetration. The coal gasifier has been a significant source of operational issues. A thorough understanding of the processes occurring in a gasifier is essential both for addressing existing causes of gasifier unavailability and improving designs for the future. Many complex processes take place in a gasifier and developing models of gasifiers results in a greater insight into these processes. Computational models in conjunction with plant data can be used to evaluate gasifier operation, solve operational problems, probe new designs and provide performance data for commercial scale-up. This report has surveyed models which are currently available for modelling gasifiers. The report contains a brief description of the three types of gasifiers which are most commonly used.

This is primarily motivated by regulations following a growing awareness regarding the potential impact of climate-change, and partly the opportunities for use of carbon-dioxide (CO2) with enhanced oil recovery (EOR). However there remain significant technology, engineering, investment and political barriers that need to be overcome before CCS can be accepted as commercially mature for the power generation industry and the finance community. The risk with early projects is high, while collaboration and trust between government, industry and investors will also be needed to commercialize the technology. With an emerging sense of urgency regarding a global consensus for tackling climate-change, one also observes that technology pathways are integrated with political agendas and it becomes important to roadmap a commercial strategy for the respective technologies taking account of government requirements for compromise and burden sharing. To some extent this can also impact on comparative choices for the most cost-effective technologies that are supported through to future commercial deployment. The situation is complicated by the fact that technology choice\u2014be it pre-combustion, post-combustion or oxy-combustion\u2014remains an open question, where parties are probably influenced by their historical expertise, available hardware and near-term perception of future carbon challenge. The fact that energy, materials and engineering costs have been escalating rapidly while there is also a fundamental paradigm change occurring, somewhat undermines the use of historical data and past experience to predict business opportunities for the future. Within this context the paper considers on-going carbon market evolution in three regions, namely Texas, North Europe and Canada, seen from a technology and project developer perspective. The paper applies updated project engineering costs for capture from natural gas (NG) and coal using post- and oxy-combustion technology. Under all circumstances projects still exhibit poor economic return on invested capital and depend on government participation; they therefore remain unattractive to the investment community. But perhaps more important is the current perception of technology and market risk which also appears to undermine motivation to make significant commitments when evaluating projects within the old paradigm. However such a situation is not politically sustainable and a new paradigm must emerge. This will occur through regulation and significant changes in pricing in the energy and commodity market\u2014including valuation of captured and avoided CO2. And this will also impact on the relative merits of various technology options. For the time being these discussion and results are only indicative of how a new paradigm and evolving technology may become \u201cgame-changing\u201d, but the paper does attempt to provide some foresight into future opportunities.Copyright \u00a9 2008 by ASME", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "d077813839046b227d60c1bc3725e65617c58580", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 215805306}, "title": "India\u2019s Energy Future and Carbon Management", "abstract": "The energy scenario in India is driven by coal, oil & gas, hydroelectric, nuclear and renewable resources. Coal is the most important & abundant fossil fuel in India and accounts for 51% of India\u2019s energy need. 45% of energy requirements are met by petroleum products, 2% by hydroelectric and the remainder by nuclear and other resources. The energy requirements in India are expected to grow at 5-6 percent per annum over the coming years to sustain the GDP growth of around 8%. To meet the challenges of India\u2019s energy outlook, R&D initiatives for exploitation of alternate source of fuels (oil shale, gas hydrate and coal-bed methane) and carbon capture & storage have been started. India is the third largest producer of coal and the present estimates of coal reserves have reached 247.85 billion tons. Coal resource of India mostly occur in sedimentary rocks of Gondwana formations of peninsular India and Tertiary formations of Northeast India with Gondwana coal accounting for 99% of total reserves. Oil shale is one of the unconventional alternate resources of energy that has emerged as a possible means to supplement declining conventional hydrocarbon production. These are fine grained sedimentary rocks containing relatively large amount of organic matter from which significant quantities of shale oil and combustible gas can be extracted. Studies have shown that similar rocks with most of their oil generating potential still preserved occur in Northeast India interbedded with Tertiary coal. The oil shale formations crop out on the surface mostly in the region called the belt of Schuppen. The estimated in-place oil reserve of this carbonaceous shale is greater than 15 billion tons. The oil from carbonaceous shale is produced by retorting, an energy intensive process in which the rock is heated to 450-550\u00b0C in the absence of oxygen. However, oil shale deposits usually contain carbonate minerals and due to pyrolysis of kerogen and the decomposition of carbonate, shale may evolve significant amount of CO2 during oil production. This could be a serious defect from the view point of global warming. Deep coal seams that are not commercially viable for coal production could be used for permanent underground storage of carbon dioxide (CO2). An added benefit of storing CO2 in this way is that additional useful methane will be displaced from the coal beds. CO2 released from oil shale could also be used for Enhanced Oil Recovery in depleted oil fields of Northeast India.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "9dffa7c63dd3cabe0c864e254e9201fee531da05", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2530414147", "DOI": "10.1108/IJCCSM-09-2015-0135", "CorpusId": 14643663}, "title": "Robust strategies of climate change mitigation in interacting energy, economy and land use systems", "abstract": "Purpose \n \n \n \n \nBioenergy is a key component of climate change mitigation strategies aiming at low stabilization.

It would deliver mandatory, economy-wide reductions in all greenhouse gases; cover most emissions without a vast new bureaucracy; use trading to achieve maximum benefits at minimum cost; and generate substantial new funds to develop the technologies needed for a low-carbon future.\n\nSome in the environmental community, however, are opposing the bill because it includes a \u201csafety valve\u201d\u2014a price protection mechanism designed to ensure that the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions don't rise above a known, predetermined level. They view this feature as a fatal flaw. I couldn't disagree more.\n\nUnder Bingaman-Specter, there's no \u201cescape hatch\u201d from the financial consequences of emitting. Companies would buy additional allowances only if the costs of reducing emissions exceed a price threshold that starts at $12 per ton of carbon dioxide ($44 per ton of carbon) and escalates 5% above the rate of inflation every year thereafter. Many who oppose this provision also insist that cutting emissions will be relatively cheap. If they're right, the safety valve will never be used. But when it comes to designing a policy that calls this bet, confidence in low-cost solutions mysteriously evaporates.\n\nI believe that those solutions do exist and that the cost cap in the Bingaman-Specter bill will be invoked rarely, if at all. But I also recognize that we are never going to pass a law unless we can convince legislators from heavily industrialized states that their concerns about U.S. jobs and competitiveness have been addressed. True, including the safety valve means opting\u2014at least initially\u2014for economic certainty over emissions certainty. But that's a trade-off worth making if it helps cut through the endless cost debates that have blocked action on climate change in this country for over a decade.\n\nThe safety valve is also important to guard against excessive price volatility in allowance markets. The potential for such volatility exists under a \u201chard\u201d emissions cap, especially in the early years of program implementation. Nothing would erode support for a carbon cap-and-trade program more quickly than energy-price spikes caused by rapidly fluctuating allowance prices. Volatility serves no one's interests\u2014except those of companies that profit by playing the market. It is no surprise, then, that business opposition to the safety valve is coming not from energy providers, but from financial traders and brokerage firms.\n\nAs the economy adjusts to carbon constraints, we'll need emissions certainty more than we need cost protection. The Bingaman-Specter bill provides the flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances by creating regular opportunities for Congress and the president to review and modify the safety valve and other program parameters. In the meantime, the safety valve plays a third crucial role: It invests the funds from allowance sales into technology incentives and R&D. The safety valve will only be triggered if our future technology options are poor, but it constantly hedges against that possibility by making deep investments in technology.\n\nA key test for any climate policy is whether it changes the investment outlook for old-style coal-fired power plants. Any climate policy that keeps this option alive is not worth much. The Bingaman-Specter bill meets this test by providing new incentives for carbon capture and storage that, coupled with a price on carbon under the emissions trading program, will make advanced coal plants with carbon capture competitive with conventional technology.\n\nAny law passed now must provide a strong starting point for long-term action.

Several CO2 storage projects around the world have demonstrated the feasibility of injecting and storing CO2 at the mega-tonne per year scale. These include the long-running Sleipner project (Norway) which started in 1996 and which has stored ~17 Mt of CO2 to date, and the Illinois Basin Decatur Project (USA) which has stored approximately 1 Mt of CO2. New projects have started over the last few years, including the QUEST project in Canada, the Gorgon project in Australia, and the Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage (ICCS) project at Decatur, Illinois, which will inject 1 Mt CO2/yr. These projects along with a wealth of injection experience from the oil and gas industry over decades, supported by an extensive literature of theory and modelling analyses, provide confidence in the subsurface storage concept intrinsic to CCUS. \nThe challenge ahead is to ramp up CCUS technology to be able to safely store CO2 at the gigatonne (Gt) per year scale to meet global CO2 emissions reductions targets. Although sufficient capacity exists in theory to store CO2 at the Gt/year scale in the continental and offshore sedimentary basins of North America, Europe, and worldwide, there are many technical challenges that need to be addressed. First, more accurate estimates of storage capacity are needed over large areas (~103\u2013104 km2) that have been targeted for storage, with associated challenges for site characterization, monitoring and storage verification. Second, whereas the few current projects are isolated in the given storage reservoirs and often within entire sedimentary basins, injections at the Gt/year scale must involve multiple large-scale projects potentially within tens of kilometres of one another and accessing similar stratigraphic intervals and probably similar reservoir units. To achieve this degree of scale-up, a better understanding of the permissible pressure increase in these large regions is needed. Pressurization from injection projects is known to extend from 10s to 100s of km from the injection wells, and interference among neighbouring projects is inevitable. Thus, there is the need for detailed understanding of the tolerance for pressure rise and potentially the need for pressure management. Furthermore, large-scale projects will require smart methods for controlling and optimizing CO2 injection, which will involve developing better understanding of the links between small (e.g., sub-pore and pore scale) and large-scale physical processes in the reservoir. \nThe key technical issues, questions, and areas in need of better understanding include: \n\u2022\u2002CO2 migration and trapping processes; \n\u2022\u2002Understanding when and how caprocks fail; \n\u2022\u2002\u0007Physics- and chemistry-based understanding of CO2 flow at all scales in the reservoir and storage complex; \n\u2022\u2002\u0007Impact of flow processes on storage at multiple scales within heterogeneous rock media. \n \nIn addition to laboratory and field studies, there are many challenges that will require developments in the theory, modelling, and simulation of CO2 storage processes. The research challenges identified by the group on Storage Injectivity and Capacity aim to exploit recent advances in the understanding of flow processes and in the use of high-performance computing, using large data sets to improve the forecasting of CO2 migration and trapping processes, the nature of pressurization and dynamic pressure limits, reservoir fracturing and dynamic geomechanical behaviour of rock units. \nAfter brainstorming the issues, the Expert Panel developed three \u2018Principle Research Directions\u2019 (PRDs) considered to be essential to the future ramp-up of CCUS to the Gt scale: \n\u2022\u2002\u0007Advancing multi-physics and multi-scale fluid flow to achieve Gt/yr capacity; \n\u2022\u2002\u0007Dynamic pressure limits for Gigatonne-scale CO2 injection; \n\u2022\u2002\u0007Optimal injection of CO2 by control of the near-well environment. \n \nThese global research propositions are outlined in the report (Mission Innovation, 2017). Here we summarize the research ambitions involved. The expert group focused primarily on storage in saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas fields, as they are expected to have the largest potential for Gt-scale storage, although the concepts will be relevant to all storage options (including CO2EOR). \nA key part of the learning process for globally significant scale-up of CO2 storage has been the insights gained from early mover projects. This experience has been summarized in various monographs [e.g., Chadwick et al., 2008; Hitchon, 2012] and review papers [e.g., Jenkins et al., 2015; Pawar et al., 2015]. \nSome key achievements in the development of CO2 storage include: \n\u2022\u2002\u0007How seismic monitoring can be used to monitor saturation and pressure changes associated with the growth of the CO2 plume; \n\u2022\u2002\u0007How downhole pressure monitoring can be used to understand the pressure distribution and evolution at storage sites; \n\u2022\u2002\u0007Understanding the rock mechanical response to injection; \n\u2022\u2002\u0007Insights into the complexity of storage reservoirs and the impact of heterogeneity on CO2 flow paths; \n\u2022\u2002\u0007Development of optimal monitoring and risk management procedures. \n \nThese early-mover CO2 storage projects and the associated research studies demonstrate both the technical viability of CO2 storage and its challenges, while also pointing to the key technologies involved in project execution.

Several technology routes and variations of process steps have been investigated to remove impurities like NOx, SOx , etc. Especially these impurities are limited for transportation and storage of compressed and purified CO2.

To quantify the impacts of future climate we developed a modelling framework which links climate models with different impact models. Bias corrected climate model output was used to force the macro-hydrological model VIC and therefore it is necessary to use numerical models. For this project a modelling framework was developed which made it possible to link climate models with hydrological, agricultural and ecosystem models. In general, our analyses shows that more water will be available for hydropower in the future. So on average, climate change will have a positive impact on potential electricity production. However the river discharge will also become more variable which will increase the flood risks and could make the power production less reliable. The increased flow variability however will make dam management more complicated because the balance between flood prevention and optimal power production will be more difficult to manage. Climate change will have a range of different impacts of forest ecosystems. The higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations will probably increase forest growth and carbon capture. Higher temperatures however will have negative impacts on forest growth and reduce the amount of carbon in the forests. The impact analyses show that as a result of climate change, the Congo basin is unlikely to see a decline in forest growth such as is sometimes predicted for the Amazon basin. Instead there could be a moderate increase in ecosystem carbon. Depending on how the climate will change there could be a shift in land cover of the different ecosystems. Based on the analyses a moderate expansion to the North and South of Evergreen forests into savannas and grasslands is the most likely future scenario. In general, climatic conditions are currently not limiting agricultural production in the Congo basin region. Only on the (drier) edges of the region water limitation is sometimes reducing the potential agricultural productions. In the tropical climates too much rainfall and high humidity limits agricultural production through nutrient leaching and fungal growth. The impact of future climate on agricultural production will therefore be limited in the region. In most of the area the water stress will increase slightly in the future. However the agriculture will not suffer from structural water shortages. Only the agriculture in the savanna regions surrounding the Congo basin could potentially face water shortages in the future. In the southern savanna region analyses indicate that more frequent droughts will affect agriculture production and water stress. In several of the COMIFAC countries there is a clear correlation between annual rainfall and GDP growth. GDP and Agricultural GDP growth rates tend to be higher in years with above-average rainfall than in the dry years. The impact of climate variability on GDP growth is most pronounced during dry years. During below-average rainfall years growth is sometimes severely reduced and generally the dryer the lower the GDP growth rate. All above-average rainfall years tend to have relatively similar economic growth rates. The correlation between rainfall and GDP growth rates is stronger in countries with lower and more variable rainfall. In most countries, agricultural GDP growth rates are affected stronger by climate variability than the total GDP growth rates. In terms of future climate change impacts on economic development our analysis shows that COMIFAC countries are especially vulnerable to a reduction in rainfall and a significant increase in interannual rainfall variability. Our results show that at a continental scale, climate change is likely to have a negative impact on development in Africa. However the economies of central African countries are likely to be less affected by climate change compared to countries in West, East and Southern Africa. Also at macro scale the climate scenarios seem to be more favourable in the central African part compared to the rest of Africa. However some climate change scenarios show large increases in climate variability and this could have a negative impact on development. In conclusion the climate change impacts on the different sectors shows that the main impacts will come from a more variable climate. No major impacts are expected in terms of water availability for agriculture and future carbon storage in the tropical forests. Also the average potential energy production from hydropower will not reduce. The most severe impacts will result from a more variable hydrological regime. This will result is higher flood frequency and will complicate future dam management.

Key measures are plume migration distance and the time evolution of the partitioning of CO2 between dissolved, immobile free-phase, and mobile free-phase forms.

The plume footprint is roughly elliptical, and extends much farther up-dip of the injection well than down-dip. The pressure increase extends far beyond the plume footprint, but the pressure response decreases rapidly with distance from the injection well, and decays rapidly in time once injection ceases.

Biodiesel has received considerable attention in recent years as it is biodegradable, renewable and non-toxic fuel. It emits less gaseous pollutants than conventional diesel fuel, and can work directly in diesel engines with no required modifications. The most common way to produce biodiesel is by transesterification of the oils with an alcohol in the presence of a catalyst to yield fatty acid methyl esters and glycerin. The production of biodiesel from rapeseed oil and ethanol was experimented in the laboratory and results are discussed. The use of microalgae as a source of biofuels is an attractive proposition from the point of view that microalgae are photosynthetic renewable resources. They produce oils with high lipid content, have fast growth rates and are capable of growth in saline waters which are unsuitable for agriculture. The most important algae in terms of abundance are Diatoms, green algae, golden algae and Cyanobacteria (prokaryotic microorganisms). These ones are also referred to as microalgae in this project. Green algae and diatoms are the most used for biofuels production, because of their high storage of lipids in oil composition. This project provides an overview in the production of biodiesel from microalgae including different systems of cultivation such as open ponds and closed Photobioreactors, the methods of harvesting biomass and extracting the oil content.

A major technology option is combining Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in the industry and power sectors. Biogenic waste contributes a major share for the numerous waste-to-energy plants around the world. This implies that adding a CCS facility to a waste-to-energy plant could establish a value chain for negative carbon dioxide emissions. Hence a waste-to-energy plant could deliver four services to society: waste management and avoided pollution, service district heating system, remove carbon dioxide from fossil-based waste categories, and generate negative carbon dioxide emissions from biogenic waste. A major barrier to deploying Bio-CCS at a waste-to-energy plant is a high investment and operation cost for the carbon dioxide capture plant, combined with lacking reward for the negative carbon dioxide emissions. In this paper I explore promising business models that could incentivize owners of waste-to-energy plants to install CCS facilities, assuming that government has established an infrastructure for transportation and permanent storage of carbon dioxide, as well as the basic framework for accounting for negative emissions.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon capture and utilisation (CCU) technologies can be an answer to the global challenge of significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Due to production methods, these gases typically contain species in trace amounts that can negatively impact the equipment they come into contact with or pipelines when injected into the gas grid. It is therefore necessary to ensure proper (and stable) gas quality that meets the requirements set out in the relevant standards. The gas quality standards require the collection and transport of a representative gas sample from the point of use to the analytical laboratory; i.e., no compounds may be added to or removed from the gas during sampling and transport. To obtain a representative sample, many challenges must be overcome. The biggest challenge is material compatibility and managing adsorption risks in the sampling systems (sampling line and sampling vessels). However, other challenges arise from the need for flow measurement with non-pure gases or from the nature of the matrix.

But there is another approach whose potential was seen decades ago, but which was sidelined because nobody found a way to harness it in a practical and economical way. This is the thermo- chemical approach, in which solar energy is captured in the configuration of certain molecules which can then release the energy on demand to produce usable heat. And unlike conventional solar-thermal systems, which require very effective insulation and even then gradually let the heat leak away, the heat-storing chemicals can remain stable for years. A novel application of carbon nanotubes shows promise as an innovative approach to storing solar energy for use whenever it's needed. Storing the sun's heat in chemical form rather than converting it to electricity or storing the heat itself in a heavily insulated container has significant advantages, since in principle the chemical material can be stored for long periods of time without losing any of its stored energy. The problem with that approach has been that until now the chemicals needed to perform this conversion and storage either degraded within a few cycles, or included the element ruthenium, which is rare and expensive. Thus the molecule called fulvalene diruthenium known as the best chemical for reversibly storing solar energy, since it did not degrade was able to accomplish this feat. By better understanding this process could make it easier to search for other compounds, made of abundant and inexpensive materials, which could be used in the same way. The new material is made using carbon nanotubes, tiny tubular structures of pure carbon, in combination with a compound called azobenzene. The resulting molecules, produced using nanoscale templates to shape and constrain their physical structure, gain \u201cnew properties that aren't available\u201d in the separate materials. Not only is this new chemical system less expensive than the earlier ruthenium- containing compound, but it also is vastly more efficient at storing energy in a given amount of space about 10,000 times higher in volumetric energy density and also making its energy density comparable to lithium-ion batteries. By using nanofabrication methods, you can control the molecules interactions, increasing the amount of energy they can store and the length of time for which they can store it and most importantly, you can control both independently. Thermo- chemical storage of solar energy uses a molecule whose structure changes when exposed to sunlight, and can remain stable in that form indefinitely. Then, when nudged by a stimulus \u2014 a catalyst, a small temperature change, a flash of light \u2014 it can quickly snap back to its other form, releasing its stored energy in a burst of heat. So that we could create a rechargeable heat battery with a long shelf life, like a conventional battery. One of the great advantages of the new approach to harnessing solar energy is that it simplifies the process by combining energy harvesting and storage into a single step. You've got a material that both converts and stores energy. \u201cIt's robust, it doesn't degrade, and it's cheap.\u201d One limitation, however, is that while this process is useful for heating applications, to produce electricity would require another conversion step, using thermoelectric devices or producing steam to run a generator. Compared to other approaches to solar energy, it has many of the advantages of solar-thermal energy, but stores the heat in the form of a fuel. It's reversible, and it's stable over a long term. You can use it where you want, on demand. You could put the fuel in the sun, charge it up, then use the heat, and place the same fuel back in the sun to recharge.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "75e5c03f0ee5f4c51442d7845511ada065352f29", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2566195452", "CorpusId": 114335575}, "title": "Carbon Emission Impact for Energy Strategy in which All Non-CCS Coal Power Plants Are Replaced by Nuclear Power Plants", "abstract": "The Paris climate conference recognized the urgency of measures to mitigate climate changes and achieved an agreement on the targets for future decades.

We are forced to look ahead on the same time scale but we have much shorter time to act as we almost used up the quota of emission of carbon before disaster would be unavoidable, as shown in paper by Meinshausen et al. and IPCC report. We have to change our ways of relying on fossil fuel dramatically in the next few decades. It would be a change in use of fossil fuel which cannot be achieved with usual business practices.

The challenge is to design, to synthesize, and to represent new useful nanomaterials with controllable sizes, shapes, and structures. And also now a day\u2019s a serious interset is required to reduce the level of CO2 the use of advanced and environment friendly CO2 seize technologies. Carbon dioxide seize and storage (CCS) applied sciences can also play an necessary function in this direction. Nanotechnology is used to seize CO2 formore than a few industrial processes.

The method is based on the separation of air-polluting CO2 from fuel gases and its subsequent storage in different types of geological formations. The outlet points and formations used as CO2 storage sites are often very far from each other. According to certain recently announced, medium-term EU plans, a 20,000 km long pipeline system will be established for the transportation of the gas by 2050, at a cost of 28.5 billion Euros. Obviously, not only technical ad safety planning, but also detailed, itemized financial and investment plans based on cost calculations (including construction and operation costs), are required to make such a grandeus enterprise economically feasible. We reviewed several studies from available literature that use different computational models to determine pipeline construction costs, based on the technical and financial data of natural gas transport pipelines and CO2 pipelines built for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) projects.

However, the risk of CO2 leakage resulting from geological storage projects has a significant impact on the surroundings, especially on the associated farmland ecosystem. As the basis for agricultural production decision-making in the CCS project area, it is very important to carry out in-depth research on the response of crops to high CO2 concentration and quantitative evaluation of crop tolerance to CO2. In this paper, the impacts of ultra-high CO2 on the plant height, maximum root length, leaf number, net photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO2 concentration, fresh and dry biomass of eight typical crops were simulated using CO2 artificial climate chamber. A comprehensive evaluation method on the crop tolerance to CO2 was established based on principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method (FCE) and the tolerance of eight typical crops to CO2 in the Loess Plateau of China was evaluated. The results indicated that the growth of eight crops was promoted in a certain range of CO2 concentration and the maximum growth indicators of C3 crops was at 10 mmol\u00b7mol and that of C4 crops was at 20 mmol\u00b7mol. When the CO2 concentration continued to increase, the growth of C3 and C4 crops were inhibited in varying degrees, in which the inhibition for C3 crops was higher. The relative tolerance of crops to CO2 was as follows: sorghum > scorpion > millet > corn > mung bean > soybean > potato > buckwheat and C4 crops were more tolerant to CO2 than C3 crops. The priority crops for CO2 leakage of the CCS project area was recommended in Loess Plateau of China. \u00a9 2019 Friends Science Publishers", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "2e2fa3cc7b4619288eeea1a305611a52a7c8c0e2", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.47444/aincej.v1i1.5", "CorpusId": 245195573}, "title": "Decarbonization for Oil and Gas Value Chain: An Update Review", "abstract": "Apart from oil and natural gas conventional reservoirs scarcities, global warming is one of the environmental petroleum industry challenges in the short-medium-long term. This is related to the dramatic growth of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission in which carbon dioxide (CO2) produced by the combustion of fossil fuels plays a significant role in atmosphere carbonization. Different technologies or systems for capturing CO2 are available such as pre-combustion systems, post-combustion systems, oxy-fuel combustion systems and capture from industrial process streams. However, decarbonization involves the removal of greenhouse gases emissions and storing them in geological formation or using them for other sectors of industries including oil production optimization. This process is known as carbon dioxide capture usage and storage (CCUS), a promising method to reduce CO2 emissions due to increasing energy demand and continued dependency on fossil fuel in the next decades while green energy is still under investigation or is not a mature option yet. Besides the CCUS method, emission reduction can also be achieved by improving energy efficiency or shifting to green energy. Therefore, Oil and gas (O&G) producers need to continue investigating the CCUS as an option that allows using fossil energy sources while the world is moving to transition to other green energies.\n\u00a0", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "ca7d75b94dd0ffdff10c54c1f42f13604848fa7d", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1086/453124", "CorpusId": 222322017}, "title": "New Publications", "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage: The Legal Landscape of Climate Change Mitigation Technology Published by Globe Law and Business, 2020 79 pp , \u00a375 / \u20ac83 (A4 Softback) \u2018The Doctrine of Positive Obligations as a Starting Point for Climate Litigation in Strasbourg: The European Court of Human Rights as a Hilfssheriff in Combating Climate Change?\u2019, 35 Journal of Environmental Law and Litigation (2020), pp 261\u2013298 \u2018Climate Change and Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects: R (on the Application of Plan B Earth) v Secretary of State for Transport\u2019, 22 Environmental Law Review (2/2020), pp 125\u2013132", "year": 1902}, {"paperId": "cfcee9ef6feed1e37bbd001ada2851612366d747", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2954036535", "DOI": "10.1081/E-ESS3-120044976", "CorpusId": 198423008}, "title": "Geologic Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "An option that has been proposed to combat the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is the capture of CO2 at large stationary sources, such as power plants, and injection into a geologic formation for permanent storage\u2014generally referred to as carbon capture and storage (CCS).

There are different types of geological formations suitable for CO2 disposal. Among many others, deep saline aquifers are taken into consideration in the present contribution. \n \nThe advantages of this reservoir compared to others are its relatively high capability and world-wide availability. The CO2 distribution over the aquifer depends on many different factors, such as the interaction between the injected CO2 and solid particles in the aquifer, the heterogeneity at different scales, gravity and many others. Researchers and engineers often consider the distribution of CO2 in the reservoir neglecting the thermal, chemical and mechanical coupling of the processes. However, these effects can play a significant role in the CO2 sequestration and are quite complex to describe. \n \nIn this context, the distinguishing feature of this investigation is that besides studying the processes in the framework of fluid dynamics and multiphase flow, the mechanical effects are also taken into consideration. In particular, the deformation of the solid within the aquifer and the cap-rock layer as well as the phase transformation of the supercritical CO2 are studied here. In order to describe these processes, a multiphasic model in the continuum mechanical framework of the well-founded Theory of Porous Media (TPM) is applied. \nIm Rahmen der CO2-Speicherungsproblematik wird angenommen, dass die geologische Speicherung von Kohlendioxid eine vielversprechende Technologie zur Reduktion von atmospharischen CO2 Emissionen ist.

However, one of the most startling observations is the increasing mean carbon dioxide concentration at Mauna Loa, Hawaii. Recordings from 1960 to the present show a total increase of almost 80 ppm CO2 to the present value of 392 in July 2011. Even without the implications on climate change, the simple fact that anthropogenic contributions of CO2 are obligation enough to seek solutions to solve the issue at hand. However the sequestration of CO2 is a multi-dimensional problem with no simple solution to be offered. It is likely dependent on the individual nation, the most accessible storage site both logistically and economically will be a driving factor in the decision making process. It is with this that attention is placed on the preliminary suggestion by Marchetti in 1977, who thought of sequestering CO2 in the path of ocean currents where natural processes would disperse it further, thus mitigating the problem. Ever since then, the concept of ocean storage of CO2 has received mixed views. Although many are currently championing the concept of geological storage, the authors believe that ocean storage, though risky, should be considered nonetheless as a viable alternative. Case in point is China with its extended coastline and relatively close access to open sea as well as deep basins makes it a prime choice. China?s continued dependence on fossil fuels for power generation and startling economic growth are additional incentive for the authors to put forward views on CCS in its current state of development. This report serves to outline some high level views in the form of possible future guidelines for a complete solution of the CCS value chain. The report is organised into eight chapters that meticulously address different elements of a CCS system. Chapter One introduces the implications of climate change as well as the project design. System characterisation is addressed in Chapter Two and Three where an effort to give a broad overview of the project, inclusive of public concerns, is made. The authors propose a complete solution that encompasses the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) effluents. Chapter Four focuses on the arrangements for transporting carbon dioxide via pipelines and liquid bulk shipment of CO2 to offshore platforms. Potential risks were identified and mitigation measures were proposed in Chapter Five. Sequestration in ocean space, proposed dilution rate as well as perceived effects associated with ocean acidification form the main argument in Chapter Six with specific application to China. The proposed solution allows for a measure of flexibility to the readers and the authors deem such an approach being necessary as CCS implementation is still in its infancy. With the capture of CO2 from coal-fired power plants by means of traditional and emerging technologies, both retrofitting of existing plants or the continued use of coal in more efficient greener plants can be considered. The choice of ocean space for sequestration purposes was primarily based on the desire to stimulate further study as there are little known effects of CO2 at great ocean depths. By addressing this topic the authors also accede to the fact that there are challenges and risks (Chapter Seven and Eight) to this storage solution that deserved further examination. As a result, public engagement strategies that are essential in getting the public interested about CCS should be actively supported. Lastly, CCS solutions in the long run should endeavor to achieve a zero carbon footprint while accommodating the steady strong development of the Chinese economy.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "94ddeb0b3b81ec0bec676fde251ee2f1f0866dba", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3204328038", "DOI": "10.2118/205809-ms", "CorpusId": 244214050}, "title": "Pitching Early for CCUS Research and Development in Oil & Gas Industry: A Well Thought Endeavor", "abstract": "\n The oil and gas industry, a highly technical industry, involves a collaboration of various disciplines of science and technology from exploration to production and utilization of the products.

The infrastructure and facilities viz, drilling rigs, pipeline, casing and tubular, platforms and chemical produced from other industries also contribute significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Increased use of oil & gas is causing the emission of GHG in the atmosphere causing temperature rise of the earth which is a major cause for climate change.

These CO2 streams vary in terms of both composition and mass flow rate, sometimes substantially. The impact of a varying CO2 stream on pipeline and storage operation is not fully understood in terms of either operability or infrastructure robustness. This study was performed to summarize basic background from the literature on the topic of operational flexibility of CO2 transport and storage, but the primary focus was on compiling real-world lessons learned about flexible operation of CO2 pipelines and storage from both large-scale field demonstrations and commercial operating experience. Modeling and pilot-scale results of research in this area were included to illustrate some of the questions that exist relative to operation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects with variable CO2 streams. It is hoped that this report\u2019s real-world findings provide readers with useful information on the topic of transport and storage of variable CO2 streams. The real-world results were obtained from two sources. The first source consisted of five full-scale, commercial transport\u2013storage projects: Sleipner, Snohvit, In Salah, Weyburn, and Illinois Basin\u2013Decatur. These scenarios were reviewed to determine the information that is available about CO2 streammore\u00a0\u00bb variability/intermittency on these demonstration-scale projects. The five projects all experienced mass flow variability or an interruption in flow. In each case, pipeline and/or injection engineers were able to accommodate any issues that arose. Significant variability in composition has not been an issue at these five sites. The second source of real- world results was telephone interviews conducted with experts in CO2 pipeline transport, injection, and storage during which commercial anecdotal information was acquired to augment that found during the literature search of the five full-scale projects. The experts represented a range of disciplines and hailed from North America and Europe. Major findings of the study are that compression and transport of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) purposes in the United States has shown that impurities are not likely to cause transport problems if CO2 stream composition standards are maintained and pressures are kept at 10.3 MPa or higher. Cyclic, or otherwise intermittent, CO2 supplies historically have not impacted in-field distribution pipeline networks, wellbore integrity, or reservoir conditions. The U.S. EOR industry has demonstrated that it is possible to adapt to variability and intermittency in CO2 supply through flexible operation of the pipeline and geologic storage facility. This CO2 transport and injection experience represents knowledge that can be applied in future CCS projects. A number of gaps in knowledge were identified that may benefit from future research and development, further enhancing the possibility for widespread application of CCS.

Absorption of CO2 at high temperature is 11 recently attracting increasingly attention . Alkali metal based sorbents present clear advantages compared to 12 other high temperature sorbents, such as high CO2 capture capacity, lower regeneration temperatures (< 750 \u00b0C) 13 and excellent stability. In this work, Na/Li-silicates prepared by mixing Na/Li carbonates with fly ash (FA) in 14 various molar ratios were evaluated for their capacity to chemisorb CO2 at 500-700\u00b0C and in presence of H2O 15 (2-12vol%), diluted CO2 (14vol%) and CO2 sorption promoters. 16 The results indicate that the carbonate:silica ratio used in the sorbents synthesis significantly affects the CO2 17 sorption capacity and regeneration temperature. The presence of steam enhances the diffusion of Li and Na ions 18 resulting in higher CO2 uptake. CO2 chemisorption follows a double layer mechanism with formation of 19 carbonate layer on the surface. The simultaneous presence of Li and Na (and K when used as additive) in the 20 formed carbonate layer results in an eutectic melt between 600 and 700\u00b0C, which facilitates the diffusion of the 21 ionic species. Li-Na-FA with molar ratio of 0.5:0.5:1 was the best prepared sorbent with a capacity of 2.54 22 molesCO2/kg sorbent (12%H2O, 14%CO2 at 700\u00b0C). Absorption/desorption was completed in 15 minutes with 23 reaction kinetics comparable to that of pure Li4SiO4 sorbents. The tested materials maintained their capacity and 24 absorption/desorption rates after 10 cycles at 700\u00b0C. Overall, the Na/Li materials showed a CO2 capture 25 capacity, stability over time and sorption-desorption kinetics comparable to those of other high-temperature 26 sorbents, such as Li-FA (Li4SiO4 prepared using fly ash), and higher stability than CaO and hydrotalcites. 27", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "d33847dd2b5447f88ad6ad0513434e38e027e1c6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2899991978", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.201802998", "CorpusId": 117341695}, "title": "Scaling Technologies To Enable Giga-Tonne/Year CO2 Storage", "abstract": "Summary Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a key climate mitigation technology required to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is evaluated for its sustainability aspects, and is found to be a potentially sustainable approach which can be a bridging technology to a more sustainable energy mix, as well as a remediation technology which can remove CO2 from the atmosphere when utilized in combination with biomass fuel. Initial actions for restructuring the stationary power sector should emphasise demand reduction and efficiency efforts, followed by switching to renewable energy sources. If the first two strategies can not provide sufficient CO2 reductions, then investments in CCS technology may be an appropriate choice. CCS with coal-fired power can be a means to decouple CO2 emissions from fossil fuel use, but other SP violations associated with coal use must also be fully addressed before this strategy can be considered a truly sustainable option.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "6fedcdfbe1acc495960840c01381ca3387e7b03c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3047494734", "DOI": "10.3390/min10080691", "CorpusId": 222567319}, "title": "Lower Cretaceous Rodby and Palaeocene Lista Shales: Characterisation and Comparison of Top-Seal Mudstones at Two Planned CCS Sites, Offshore UK", "abstract": "Petroleum-rich basins at a mature stage of exploration and production offer many opportunities for large-scale Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) since oil and gas were demonstrably contained by low-permeability top-sealing rocks, such as shales. For CCS to work, there must be effectively no leakage from the injection site, so the nature of the top-seal is an important aspect for consideration when appraising prospective CCS opportunities. The Lower Cretaceous Rodby Shale and the Palaeocene Lista Shale have acted as seals to oil and gas accumulations (e.g., the Atlantic and Balmoral fields) and may now play a critical role in sealing the Acorn and East Mey subsurface carbon storage sites. The characteristics of these important shales have been little addressed in the hydrocarbon extraction phase, with an understandable focus on reservoir properties and their influence on resource recovery rates. Here, we assess the characteristics of the Rodby and Lista Shales using wireline logs, geomechanical tests, special core analysis (mercury intrusion) and mineralogical and petrographic techniques, with the aim of highlighting key properties that identify them as suitable top-seals. The two shales, defined using the relative gamma log values (or Vshale), have similar mean pore throat radius (approximately 18 nm), splitting tensile strength (approximately 2.5 MPa) and anisotropic values of splitting tensile strength, but they display significant differences in terms of wireline log character, porosity and mineralogy. The Lower Cretaceous Rodby Shale has a mean porosity of approximately 14 %, a mean permeability of 263 nD (2.58 \u00d7 10\u221219 m2), and is calcite rich and has clay minerals that are relatively rich in non-radioactive phases such as kaolinite. The Palaeocene Lista Shale has a mean porosity of approximately 16% a mean permeability of 225 nD (2.21 \u00d7 10\u221219 m2), and is calcite free, but contains abundant quartz silt and is dominated by smectite. The 2% difference in porosity does not seem to equate to a significant difference in permeability. Elastic properties derived from wireline log data show that Young\u2019s modulus, material stiffness, is very low (5 GPa) for the most shale (clay mineral)-rich Rodby intervals, with Young\u2019s modulus increasing as shale content decreases and as cementation (e.g., calcite) increases. Our work has shown that Young\u2019s modulus, which can be used to inform the likeliness of tensile failure, may be predictable based on routine gamma, density and compressive sonic logs in the majority of wells where the less common shear logs were not collected. The predictability of Young\u2019s modulus from routine well log data could form a valuable element of CCS-site top-seal appraisals. This study has shown that the Rodby and Lista Shales represent good top-seals to the Acorn and East Mey CCS sites and they can hold CO2 column heights of approximately 380 m. The calcite-rich Rodby Shale may be susceptible to localised carbonate dissolution and increasing porosity and permeability but decreasing tendency to develop fracture permeability in the presence of injected CO2, as brittle calcite dissolves. In contrast, the calcite-free, locally quartz-rich, Lista Shale will be geochemically inert to injected CO2 but retain its innate tendency to develop fracture permeability (where quartz rich) in the presence of injected CO2.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "0cb3499cfed74f466fdfbda77457484eb4a69451", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3147776314", "DOI": "10.1021/ACSENERGYLETT.1C00174", "CorpusId": 233404610}, "title": "Comparative Technoeconomic Analysis of Renewable Generation of Methane Using Sunlight, Water, and Carbon Dioxide", "abstract": "Thirty-one percent of the primary energy consumed in the United States comes from the burning of natural gas, 70\u221290% of which is composed of methane (CH4). 1 Natural gas is recovered from onshore and offshore natural gas and oil wells and from coal beds. Currently, the United States has enough supply of dry natural gas to sustain current consumption for 92 years. Meanwhile, California consumes 2.14 MMcf (43.2 million tons) of natural gas per year, over a quarter of which is used to generate electric power and which provides approximately 40% of the electrical energy in the state. Because an extensive nationwide storage and distribution network already exists for natural gas, the development of renewable CH4 could enable rapid and widespread distribution of zero-carbon energy services. Thus, for California to meet its renewable portfolio standard, that is, 60% renewable energy for electricity generation by 2030, and to conserve a limited resource, it is imperative to assess how to develop and deploy technologies for renewable generation of CH4 in the next decade. While an increasing number of power-to-gas (PtG) projects for CH4 generation or H2 generation are being planned globally, the largest source of renewable CH4 currently being produced in the United States comes from anaerobic digesters that convert cow manure into natural gas. There are currently over 250 such systems in operation with more under construction. In addition to generating CH4 renewably, these anaerobic digesters also prevent the release of CH4\ue0d5 one of the most potent greenhouse gases\ue0d5into the atmosphere. However, colocation of dairy farms and anaerobic digesters alone will not yield enough renewable methane to replace the current energy demand met by natural gas. For example, the residential natural gas demand in California is \u223c25,000 ton/day, while an average dairy farm can produce only \u223c5 ton/day of natural gas from anaerobic digesters. If all potential biogas in California was realized it could power 180,000 homes or 435,000 vehicles, which represents approximately 1.2% of all homes or 3% of all registered vehicles in the state. While these anaerobic digesters colocated with dairy farms may seem to have small production capacity, they are among the largest sources of renewable CH4 generation in the world. Therefore, it is important to evaluate other more readily scalable technology pathways for renewable generation of CH4. Here we outline multiple technology routes for renewable generation of CH4 from sunlight, water (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) (Figures 1 and 2). We evaluate the technology readiness level (TRL), the demonstrated scale of these candidate technologies, the cost for CH4 generation, as well as the cost required to provide the necessary feedstocks\ue0d5H2O, CO2, and H2. We investigate and compare four main CO2 methanation pathways: thermochemical (via the Sabatier reaction), biochemical, photoelectrochemical, and electrochemical (Figure S1). By applying a standard discounted cash flow method to each technology, we assess the current status and future opportunities and compare different technology pathways side-by-side. The detailed assumptions for the technoeconomic analysis (TEA) of technologies evaluated in this study are included in the Supporting Information, and the database files used for arriving at detailed cost values are also included in the Supporting Information. The baseline CH4 production was assumed to be at a scale of 30 kton CH4/year (1,500 Mcf per year), or 81 ton CH4/day (4 Mcf/day). We calculate the CO2 capture, H2 production, and water generation rates needed to match this production rate, that is, H2 production rate of 40 ton/day, CO2 capture rate of 245 ton/day, and water generation rate of 365 ton/day. No carbon credits were accounted for in this study. The electricity price for all current systems was assumed to be $49/MWh based on the 2018 data from solar utility PV in California. The TRL is evaluated from 1 to 9, where TRL 1\u22122 corresponds to the observation of basic principles in the academic development, TRL 3\u22124 to proof-of-concept development at lab scale, TRL 5\u22126 to process development and system integration from lab to prepilot scale, TRL 7\u22128 to optimization and precommercialization scale, and TRL 8\u22129 to commercial operation at scale. The technological pathways considered in this study also included the traditional PtG routes, in which H2 is produced via electrolysis followed by CH4 synthesis. 12 In addition, while", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "da0e67d62382853716f4b8a13f664d1901c726c7", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.9734/ijecc/2021/v11i1230600", "CorpusId": 246467109}, "title": "Assessment of Biomass and Carbon Stocks in Mango (Mangifera indica L.)

Carbon sequestration by green plants is an effective method of reducing atmospheric CO2. At the moment, carbon sequestration by horticulture crops is an effective method of reducing atmospheric CO2. In the current work, a non-destructive in-situ biomass estimation approach was utilised to measure the biomass of a tree. The above ground biomass (AGB), below ground biomass (BGB), and carbon sequestration capacity of Mango (Mangifera indica L.) orchards in Ratnagiri district of Konkan area, Maharashtra, are investigated in this study. In Ratnagiri district the average carbon stock rate was found to be 95.89 t/ha. In present study, allometric equations used to estimate AGB and BGB of Mangifera indica L. The potential of mango to sequester carbon depends on the age of the mango tree and the diameter of the trees. In the present study, above-ground biomass indicates that as mango tree diameter increases, the value of above-ground biomass also increases. Hence, the study showed that the diameter class for AGB as a function of diameter at breast height (DBH) has demonstrated a strong relation. This indicates the important role of large-diameter trees in carbon capture and storage.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "6b8158e1b8edc08eefa5896af80467c97150bffa", "externalIds": {"MAG": "142957356", "DOI": "10.1201/b15512-10", "CorpusId": 127503859}, "title": "Carbon capture and storage", "abstract": "To stabilise atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) at reasonable levels, drastic \ncuts in anthropogenic emissions are required in the coming decades.
