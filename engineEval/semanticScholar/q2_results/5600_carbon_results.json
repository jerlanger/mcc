Currently, the United States has enough supply of dry natural gas to sustain current consumption for 92 years. Meanwhile, California consumes 2.14 MMcf (43.2 million tons) of natural gas per year, over a quarter of which is used to generate electric power and which provides approximately 40% of the electrical energy in the state. Because an extensive nationwide storage and distribution network already exists for natural gas, the development of renewable CH4 could enable rapid and widespread distribution of zero-carbon energy services. Thus, for California to meet its renewable portfolio standard, that is, 60% renewable energy for electricity generation by 2030, and to conserve a limited resource, it is imperative to assess how to develop and deploy technologies for renewable generation of CH4 in the next decade. While an increasing number of power-to-gas (PtG) projects for CH4 generation or H2 generation are being planned globally, the largest source of renewable CH4 currently being produced in the United States comes from anaerobic digesters that convert cow manure into natural gas. There are currently over 250 such systems in operation with more under construction. In addition to generating CH4 renewably, these anaerobic digesters also prevent the release of CH4\ue0d5 one of the most potent greenhouse gases\ue0d5into the atmosphere. However, colocation of dairy farms and anaerobic digesters alone will not yield enough renewable methane to replace the current energy demand met by natural gas. For example, the residential natural gas demand in California is \u223c25,000 ton/day, while an average dairy farm can produce only \u223c5 ton/day of natural gas from anaerobic digesters. If all potential biogas in California was realized it could power 180,000 homes or 435,000 vehicles, which represents approximately 1.2% of all homes or 3% of all registered vehicles in the state. While these anaerobic digesters colocated with dairy farms may seem to have small production capacity, they are among the largest sources of renewable CH4 generation in the world. Therefore, it is important to evaluate other more readily scalable technology pathways for renewable generation of CH4. Here we outline multiple technology routes for renewable generation of CH4 from sunlight, water (H2O), and carbon dioxide (CO2) (Figures 1 and 2). We evaluate the technology readiness level (TRL), the demonstrated scale of these candidate technologies, the cost for CH4 generation, as well as the cost required to provide the necessary feedstocks\ue0d5H2O, CO2, and H2. We investigate and compare four main CO2 methanation pathways: thermochemical (via the Sabatier reaction), biochemical, photoelectrochemical, and electrochemical (Figure S1). By applying a standard discounted cash flow method to each technology, we assess the current status and future opportunities and compare different technology pathways side-by-side. The detailed assumptions for the technoeconomic analysis (TEA) of technologies evaluated in this study are included in the Supporting Information, and the database files used for arriving at detailed cost values are also included in the Supporting Information. The baseline CH4 production was assumed to be at a scale of 30 kton CH4/year (1,500 Mcf per year), or 81 ton CH4/day (4 Mcf/day). We calculate the CO2 capture, H2 production, and water generation rates needed to match this production rate, that is, H2 production rate of 40 ton/day, CO2 capture rate of 245 ton/day, and water generation rate of 365 ton/day. No carbon credits were accounted for in this study. The electricity price for all current systems was assumed to be $49/MWh based on the 2018 data from solar utility PV in California. The TRL is evaluated from 1 to 9, where TRL 1\u22122 corresponds to the observation of basic principles in the academic development, TRL 3\u22124 to proof-of-concept development at lab scale, TRL 5\u22126 to process development and system integration from lab to prepilot scale, TRL 7\u22128 to optimization and precommercialization scale, and TRL 8\u22129 to commercial operation at scale. The technological pathways considered in this study also included the traditional PtG routes, in which H2 is produced via electrolysis followed by CH4 synthesis. 12 In addition, while", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "40b14d8cae5c7bad898d5a3720b0ca9ffccf0216", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2533582278", "CorpusId": 115011314}, "title": "Dynamic Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Processing with Energy Storage Applications", "abstract": "Dynamic Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Processing with Energy Storage Applications Farhad Fazlollahi Department of Chemical Engineering, BYU Doctor of Philosophy The cryogenic carbon captureTM (CCC) process provides energyand cost-efficient carbon capture and can be configured to provide an energy storage system using an open-loop natural gas (NG) refrigeration system, which is called energy storing cryogenic carbon capture (CCC-ESTM). This investigation focuses on the transient operation and especially on the dynamic response of this energy storage system and explores its efficiency, effectiveness, design, and operation. This investigation included four tasks. The first task explores the steady-state design of four different natural gas liquefaction processes simulated by Aspen HYSYS. These processes differ from traditional LNG process in that the CCC process vaporizes the LNG and the cold vapors return through the LNG heat exchangers, exchanging sensible heat with the incoming flows. The comparisons include costs and energy performance with individually optimized processes, each operating at three operating conditions: energy storage, energy recovery, and balanced operation. The second task examines steady-state and transient models and optimization of natural gas liquefaction using Aspen HYSYS. Steady-state exergy and heat exchanger efficiency analyses characterize the performance of several potential systems. Transient analyses of the optimal steady-state model produced most of the results discussed here. The third task explores transient Aspen HYSYS modeling and optimization of two natural gas liquefaction processes and identifies the rate-limiting process components during load variations. Novel flowrate variations included in this investigation drive transient responses of all units, especially compressors and heat exchangers. Model-predictive controls (MPC) effectively manages such heat exchangers and compares favorably with results using traditional controls. The last task shows how an unprocessed natural gas (NG) pretreatment system can remove more than 90% of the CO2 from NG with CCC technology using Aspen Plus simulations and experimental data. This task shows how CCC-based technology can treat NG streams to prepare them for LNG use. Data from an experimental bench-scale apparatus verify simulation results.

EXECUTIVE S UMMARY Australia has a significant existing coal fired power generation capacity, contributing 80 percent of the total electricity generation. Constructing new or retrofitted coal with CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) involves three key steps. Firstly CO 2 is extracted at some point in the coal to electricity conversion process, depending on the type of technology used. The CO 2 is then prepared for transport and stored in a suitable geological sink. Australia has an enormous potential resource for geological storage of CO 2. However, like mineral resources, storage sites must be graded by their economic potential. Usable storage \"reserves\" will depend on the price of carbon and distance from the capture plant. The cheapest locations for CO 2 storage are the Latrobe Valley in the Gippsland Basin (A$7 per tonne of CO 2 avoided), the Southern Queensland in the Surat Basin (A$12 per tonne) and the Perth region in the Bunbury Trough of the Perth Basin (A$10 per tonne).

The starting points of this dissertation are the following research questions: (a) what are current and potential mid-term environmental implications of biofuels and biochemical applications, (b) what is the potential size and contribution of bioeconomy in a national energy system in pursuing mid-term climate change mitigation targets, (c) what are the potential mid-term economic implications of bioeconomy developments at a national level and (d) how can tools and methods for assessing current and mid-term bioeconomy developments be improved. To shed light into the environmental impacts of advanced biochemicals, this dissertation applies life cycle assessment on existing bioplastics supply chains, namely bioplastics from Brazilian and Indian sugarcane ethanol. The potential for large-scale bioeconomy developments is assessed by extending an energy systems model of the Netherlands to include detailed representation of biomass cost and supply, and emerging sectors such as advanced biofuels and biochemicals. Scenario analysis is performed for different technological development pathways, biomass cost-supply and fossil fuel price scenarios to 2030. The macro-economic impacts of large-scale bioeconomy developments in the Netherlands to 2030 are assessed using a macro-economic top down model. The results show that bioplastics may offer savings on greenhouse gas emissions and fossil resource use, compared to their petrochemical counterparts. However, the use of fossil fuel in bio-based production systems needs to be reduced as their use may lead to comparable or higher greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuel-based plastics. In the Netherlands, biochemicals are shown to be cost-competitive in the mid-term, if old petrochemical production capacity is phased out and fossil fuel prices are as anticipated by business-as-usual scenarios. Under existing policies, the Netherlands reduce their greenhouse gas emissions but fail to achieve the necessary emission reduction, in line with their committed targets. Efforts need to intensify, and even under an ambitious carbon tax, rapid technological development of advanced biomass conversion technologies, and carbon capture and storage are required for deep emission reduction. In the long term, large-scale bioeconomy developments may benefit the Netherlands by leading to higher economic returns and reduce downward trends in employment and trade balance. However, low technology development, high fossil fuel prices and/or high biomass prices impede achieving the emission reduction targets. In light of the above, advanced biomass uses may offer benefits, if stricter targets and stimulating policies on renewable energy and bioeconomy are considered. To valorise opportunities and minimise risks efforts are required to ensure sustainable and low-cost supply of biomass, promote sustainable bioenergy and biochemical pathways and stimulate co-operation across different end-use sectors of bioenergy.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "caf0d5b5ff314f0659e2169a2b81b340d7d4ae04", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fclim.2021.709891", "CorpusId": 236918003}, "title": "Business Models for Negative Emissions From Waste-to-Energy Plants", "abstract": "Negative emissions of carbon dioxide will likely be needed to meet the <2\u00b0C warming above the pre-industrial level goal of the Paris Agreement. A major technology option is combining Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in the industry and power sectors. Biogenic waste contributes a major share for the numerous waste-to-energy plants around the world. This implies that adding a CCS facility to a waste-to-energy plant could establish a value chain for negative carbon dioxide emissions. Hence a waste-to-energy plant could deliver four services to society: waste management and avoided pollution, service district heating system, remove carbon dioxide from fossil-based waste categories, and generate negative carbon dioxide emissions from biogenic waste. A major barrier to deploying Bio-CCS at a waste-to-energy plant is a high investment and operation cost for the carbon dioxide capture plant, combined with lacking reward for the negative carbon dioxide emissions. In this paper I explore promising business models that could incentivize owners of waste-to-energy plants to install CCS facilities, assuming that government has established an infrastructure for transportation and permanent storage of carbon dioxide, as well as the basic framework for accounting for negative emissions. The business models are either founded on waste renovation customers being able and willing to pay for the additional cost of producing negative emissions of carbon dioxide directly or through certificates, or investments in CCS being incentivized by government through a guaranteed price or tax rebates for negative emissions of carbon dioxide.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "4c3488ec1ddb94eea3c8b0c72bcccfa2294cbf61", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1500793770", "CorpusId": 107174224}, "title": "Pilot plant for capturing CO2 using a precipitating potassium carbonate solvent", "abstract": "The Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) researches and develops technologies for carbon dioxide capture and geological storage of carbon dioxide.

The results show a lower carbon content in the aboveground biomass of 10-25-year-old (planted) stands than in the >50-year old (natural) stands. However, we found more organic carbon in sediments in planted sites than in natural sites, which could be partly due to the higher tree densities in the former. The derived organic carbon in particulate matter was lower in the planted forest than in the natural forest, which could be due to allochthonous inputs of organic matter from rivers and creeks, and to a higher number of species in the natural forests. This study demonstrated that the amount of carbon stored in mangroves increases with age, but the amount of carbon stored in mangrove soils could vary with mangrove density, sediment size, allochthonous inputs, and inundation.

Simulation technology plays an important role in providing storage capacity estimates and analyzing long-term safety and risk factors of leakage to the surface. Two of several important questions that need to be answered before a storage project may be approved is how fast and how much CO2 can be injected without compromising the integrity of the sealing caprock, which stops it from migrating to the surface. To evaluate the integrity we rely on mathematical models, but due to the large extent of the area that needs to be considered and the many processes that are involved the calculations can quickly become large and complicated and very time consuming to solve. For screening purposes of potential storage sites, or investigation of potential storage sites when little data is available, many model realizations are needed, thus fast and robust yet accurate numerical techniques are not only tractable but also essential. To understand what happens to the CO2, formation water and rock during injection and storage, we have thoroughly reviewed the main processes that are relevant to the integrity of the reservoir and sealing formations. These main processes are fluid flow, stress change and temperature change and they are all coupled where for instance a change in pore pressure and temperature due to CO2 injection causes deformations and stress alterations that can affect the integrity of the injection reservoir and caprock. Considering the low solubility of CO2 in formation water under typical storage conditions (depth, temperature, pressure and salinity) we have illustrated that it is a good approximation to treat the injected CO2 and formation water as two separate fluids. Miscibility is therefore not an important process to consider in relation to long-term mechanical integrity and this simplifies the mathematical description of fluid flow. Whether the thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling, where the temperature change is also considered, is important to evaluate is less obvious. Through examples we show that the in situ temperature is important to consider when estimating material properties, but the effect of the cold (CO2) injection, relative to the storage formation, is very local and mainly affects the near-field of the injector. The cooling effect reduces the spreading of the CO2, but has little effect on the pore pressure. In general, cold injection (relative to formation temperature) lowers the fracture pressure of the rock and the limit for maximum sustainable injection rate, and therefore, ignoring non-isothermal effects can underestimate the risk of failure, and vice versa for hot injection. A risk analysis of reactivation of faults in the sealing formation in the CO2 storage project at In Salah, Algeria, revealed that the thermal effect can make the difference between safe and risky storage. To achieve a procedure for faster numerical evaluation, the layering structure and high aspect ratio of typical storage reservoirs can be used to simplify the mathematical", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "150c1a1ebc202ea0e40013c30d77e0e7cf2c701d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3095712187", "DOI": "10.3390/catal10111278", "CorpusId": 228853984}, "title": "Enhanced Carbon Dioxide Decomposition Using Activated SrFeO3\u2212\u03b4", "abstract": "Today, climate change caused by global warming has become a worldwide problem with increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

For CCS to work, there must be effectively no leakage from the injection site, so the nature of the top-seal is an important aspect for consideration when appraising prospective CCS opportunities. The Lower Cretaceous Rodby Shale and the Palaeocene Lista Shale have acted as seals to oil and gas accumulations (e.g., the Atlantic and Balmoral fields) and may now play a critical role in sealing the Acorn and East Mey subsurface carbon storage sites. The characteristics of these important shales have been little addressed in the hydrocarbon extraction phase, with an understandable focus on reservoir properties and their influence on resource recovery rates. Here, we assess the characteristics of the Rodby and Lista Shales using wireline logs, geomechanical tests, special core analysis (mercury intrusion) and mineralogical and petrographic techniques, with the aim of highlighting key properties that identify them as suitable top-seals. The two shales, defined using the relative gamma log values (or Vshale), have similar mean pore throat radius (approximately 18 nm), splitting tensile strength (approximately 2.5 MPa) and anisotropic values of splitting tensile strength, but they display significant differences in terms of wireline log character, porosity and mineralogy. The Lower Cretaceous Rodby Shale has a mean porosity of approximately 14 %, a mean permeability of 263 nD (2.58 \u00d7 10\u221219 m2), and is calcite rich and has clay minerals that are relatively rich in non-radioactive phases such as kaolinite. The Palaeocene Lista Shale has a mean porosity of approximately 16% a mean permeability of 225 nD (2.21 \u00d7 10\u221219 m2), and is calcite free, but contains abundant quartz silt and is dominated by smectite. The 2% difference in porosity does not seem to equate to a significant difference in permeability. Elastic properties derived from wireline log data show that Young\u2019s modulus, material stiffness, is very low (5 GPa) for the most shale (clay mineral)-rich Rodby intervals, with Young\u2019s modulus increasing as shale content decreases and as cementation (e.g., calcite) increases. Our work has shown that Young\u2019s modulus, which can be used to inform the likeliness of tensile failure, may be predictable based on routine gamma, density and compressive sonic logs in the majority of wells where the less common shear logs were not collected. The predictability of Young\u2019s modulus from routine well log data could form a valuable element of CCS-site top-seal appraisals. This study has shown that the Rodby and Lista Shales represent good top-seals to the Acorn and East Mey CCS sites and they can hold CO2 column heights of approximately 380 m. The calcite-rich Rodby Shale may be susceptible to localised carbonate dissolution and increasing porosity and permeability but decreasing tendency to develop fracture permeability in the presence of injected CO2, as brittle calcite dissolves. In contrast, the calcite-free, locally quartz-rich, Lista Shale will be geochemically inert to injected CO2 but retain its innate tendency to develop fracture permeability (where quartz rich) in the presence of injected CO2.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "7a983b1ee0278d1d02895eb7a7bf28b848d738e8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2413178345", "CorpusId": 114365449}, "title": "Greenhouse gas mitigation technology results of CO{sub 2} capture & disposal studies", "abstract": "In response to the increase in the global concentrations of greenhouse gases, the IEA Greenhouse Gas RD disposal in the oceans, in aquifers, in depleted gas reservoirs and terrestrial storage as a solid.

Owing to its promising aspect to application technologies, gas hydrate has been widely studied recently, especially $CO_2$ hydrate for the CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) issue. The key point of $CO_2$ hydrate technology for the CCS is how to produce gas hydrate in an efficient and economic way. In this study, we have tried to study the characteristic of gas hydrate formation using micro-sized ice through an ultrasonic nozzle which generate 2.4 MHz frequency wave. $CO_2$ as a carrier gas brings micro-sized mist into low-temperature reactor, where the mist and carrier gas forms $CO_2$ hydrate under $-55^{\\circ}C$ and atmospheric pressure condition and some part of the mist also remains unreacted micro-sized ice. Formed gas hydrate was average 10.7 of diameter at average. The starting ice particle was set to constant pressure to form $CO_2$ hydrate and the consumed amount of $CO_2$ gas was simultaneously measured to calculate the conversion of ice into gas hydrate. Results showed that the gas hydrate formation was highly suitable because of its extremely high gas-solid contact area, and the formation rate was also very high. Self-preservation effect of $CO_2$ hydrate was confirmed by the measurement of $CO_2$ hydrate powder at normal and at pressed state, which resulted that this kind of gas storage and transport could be feasible using $CO_2$ hydrate formation.\u3011", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "75e5c03f0ee5f4c51442d7845511ada065352f29", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2566195452", "CorpusId": 114335575}, "title": "Carbon Emission Impact for Energy Strategy in which All Non-CCS Coal Power Plants Are Replaced by Nuclear Power Plants", "abstract": "The Paris climate conference recognized the urgency of measures to mitigate climate changes and achieved an agreement on the targets for future decades.

We are forced to look ahead on the same time scale but we have much shorter time to act as we almost used up the quota of emission of carbon before disaster would be unavoidable, as shown in paper by Meinshausen et al. and IPCC report. We have to change our ways of relying on fossil fuel dramatically in the next few decades. It would be a change in use of fossil fuel which cannot be achieved with usual business practices. Arising awareness of reality and threat of global warming in parallel with fading promise of nuclear fusion and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology, should convince the public to accept nuclear fission contribution to climate change mitigation, at least for the climate critical years up to 2065. Nuclear fission has the additional value of supporting intermittent sources by covering the base load consumption. It can be available now, with proven reactors, such as advanced LWR reactors. Nuclear strategy in this paper outlines a proposal to replace all non-CCS coal power plants with nuclear power plants in the period 2025-2065. Assuming once through advanced LWR technology, one would need nuclear capacity of 1600 GW to replace coal power plants in the period 2025-2065. Corresponding reduction of emission would amount to 11.8 Gt of CO2. This energy strategy would reduce carbon emission by approximately 22% in the year 2065.

We optimized the size of the regenerator and solvent storage vessels to maximize profitability. Results indicate that the profitability benefits of flexible CCS range from 0 to 35%. Most of the potential benefit is capital savings from allowing the regenerator to be undersized. The benefits of flexible CCS were found to decline with increasing CO2 prices, with steady-state units preferable above a CO2 emissions price of $40/tonne. Flexible CCS was never optimal when the overall plant was profitable. While flexible CCS can boost profitability under policies that force plants with CCS to be built even where they are not profitable, it is less relevant under market-based policies that incentivize CCS through CO2 prices.

This paper proposes a new perspective for determining the most cost-efficient CO2 capture ratio using a modeling and simulation approach that balances the per unit parasitic energy consumption for absorbent regeneration with the per unit capital cost of the CO2 capture unit of a coal-fired power plant. Using a typical 550 MW supercritical pulverized coal-fired power plant in China as the reference plant, with monoethanolamine (MEA) absorption unit for CO2 capture, a process model of the power generation unit together with the MEA CO2 capture unit was developed and detailed process simulations were conducted with the model. Then, a sensitivity analysis was then conducted to study the impact on key plant behavior indicators, including per unit energy penalty for absorbent regeneration, net power output and power generation efficiency, total capital cost of the power plant together with the MEA CO2 absorption unit, per unit capital cost of the MEA unit, COE, as well as the per unit CO2 avoidance cost (indicated by cost per tonne (t) CO2 avoided), across a CO2 capture ratio range between 20% and 99%. The results show that when CO2 capture ratio is low, while the unit energy consumption for absorbent regeneration per tCO2 avoided increases steadily with the increase of CO2 capture ratio, the cost per tCO2 avoided decreases as the MEA absorption train is scaled up given the high capital cost of each MEA train. After CO2 capture ratio reaches certain level (60% for this plant), the cost per tCO2 avoided starts to increase with CO2 capture ratio, since the unit energy consumption for absorbent regeneration per tCO2 avoided has increased to so high that it supplants the scaling effect of the MEA train and becomes the dominant factor that determines the increase or decrease trend of the cost per tCO2 avoided. Besides, due to the physical restraint on the upper bound of CO2 capture capability of one single MEA train by the diameter of the absorber, an additional MEA train is needed when the CO2 capture ratio increases to certain points (40% and 85% for this plant), resulting in jumps of several parameters including the total capital cost for the power plant and MEA CO2 capture unit, per unit capital cost for the MEA CO2 capture unit, and last the cost per tCO2 avoided. Based on all these result, finally a cost-optimal CO2 capture ratio of 40% (365 RMB/tCO2-_avoided) was obtained, which is easier for the power plant to bear while realizing a significant reduction in CO2 emission of this plant. Therefore, applying this approach for determining CO2 capture ratios could help minimize the barrier for the initiation of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in China's power industry. Besides, future replacement or improvement for the MEA CO2 capture technology has the potential to further reduce the cost per tCO2 avoided, which needs special attention.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "449ef75eff65627dab7668ce175b5181b71c516d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1841076567", "CorpusId": 129580012}, "title": "RSS Discovery Cruise 332, 21 Aug \u2013 25 Sep 2008.

To do this, we compare results from hydro-mechanical (HM-model) and thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM model) CO2 injection simulations, including the equation of state for the fluids. The injected CO2 is colder than the storage reservoir, and as the CO2 migrates, it cools down the surrounding formations, mainly the reservoir and the overlying caprock. Increased pore pressure due to injection dissipates fast in the high-permeable reservoir in Smeaheia. However, in the caprock, the cooling causes the fluid to contract and the low-permeable caprock creates undrained conditions for the formation water which results in significant reduction in pore pressure. We observe that the thermal effect contributes to destabilizing the reservoir and stabilizing the caprock, which is seemingly fortuitous, but also potentially an unpredictable situation because of the large stress transients and gradients in a small area where the stability can be sensitive to small weaknesses and heterogeneities.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "504d239cf5070b041d944c7ff3488b7db4f75b42", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2157994641", "DOI": "10.2172/971595", "CorpusId": 111229057}, "title": "Energy Assurance: Essential Energy Technologies for Climate Protection and Energy Security", "abstract": "We present and apply a new method for analyzing the significance of advanced technology for achieving two important national energy goals: climate protection and energy security. Quantitative metrics for U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2050 and oil independence in 2030 are specified, and the impacts of 11 sets of energy technologies are analyzed using a model that employs the Kaya identity and incorporates the uncertainty of technological breakthroughs. The goals examined are a 50% to 80% reduction in CO2 emissions from energy use by 2050 and increased domestic hydrocarbon fuels supply and decreased demand that sum to 11 mmbd by 2030. The latter is intended to insure that the economic costs of oil dependence are not more than 1% of U.S. GDP with 95% probability by 2030. Perhaps the most important implication of the analysis is that meeting both energy goals requires a high probability of success (much greater than even odds) for all 11 technologies. Two technologies appear to be indispensable for accomplishment of both goals: carbon capture and storage, and advanced fossil liquid fuels.

We found that both the incorporation pattern/incorporated Mg2+ quantity in the hillock structure and the Mg2+-induced morphological change of the hillock surface showed strong dependence of the growth conditions. Specifically, when Mg/Ca was high (i.e., >5) and \u03a9calcite was low (i.e., ~0.45), Mg2+ was predominantly incorporated into the negative sectors of the hillock structure, resulting in gradual loss of step structure and morphological amorphism on these vicinal surfaces. When Mg/Ca and \u03a9calcite were in intermediate ranges (i.e., Mg/Ca < 5, and 0.45 < \u03a9calcite < 1), the originally straight edges of the hillock steps exhibited curvatures of varying degrees and formed \u201ctear-drop\u201d morphologies. It is noted that such \u201ctear-drop\u201d morphology was stable within the duration of the experiments and did not evolve into other surface patterns. By contrast, when both Mg/Ca and \u03a9calcite were high (i.e., Mg/Ca > 5, and \u03a9calcite > 1.1), the growing hillocks experienced two phases of morphological changes, initiated with the formation of \u201ctear-drops\u201d followed by the development of linear ruptures along [481] and [441] directions. And the occurrence of these ruptures segmented the hillock surface effectively into multiple isolated plateaus. Significantly, we revealed the underlying mechanisms for these condition-specific effects of Mg2+ on calcite growth, which mainly resulted from the interplay among three major factors: (1) the size-mismatch between Mg2+ and Ca2+ that causes structural strains in magnesian calcite and leads to morphological amorphism in high-Mg carbonate; (2) the asymmetry of the calcite crystal structure that sets a physical limitation for Mg2+ incorporation patterns in the hillock structure; and (3) the step advancing rate (i.e., the calcite growth kinetics) that affects both Mg2+ incorporation and the accommodation of Mg2+-induced structural strains in the hillock structure. Detailed discussions were given for each growth scenario. The results of our study provide a theoretical base to decipher the roles of Mg2+ in CaCO3 mineralization, and thus, have important implication for a range of processes that involve the growth of Mg-Ca-CO3 systems, such as biomineralization, carbon capture and storage, and scale controls in industrial settings.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "16c381d875d2e358b736e2c12ff60144ff5d8ff6", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 220917481}, "title": "Carbon Storage and Climate Policy in a Growth Model with Innovation", "abstract": "We study the implications of the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology availability on the optimal use of polluting exhaustible resources and on optimal climate policies.

CCS accelerates the optimal extraction pace, though it may foster CO2 emissions for the early generations. Moreover, it is detrimental to output growth. Next, we study the implementation of a unit tax on pollution. Contrary to previous results of the literature, its level here matters, as it provides the right incentives to CCS effort.

Cranberries are grown in acidic, naturally low-fertility sandy beds. Cranberry fertilization is guided by general soil and tissue nutrient tests in addition to yield target and vegetative biomass. However, other factors such as cultivar, location, and carbon and nutrient storage impact cranberry nutrition and yield. The objective of this study was to customize nutrient diagnosis and fertilizer recommendation at local scale and for next-year cranberry production after accounting for local factors and carbon and nutrient carryover effects. We collected 1768 observations from on-farm surveys and fertilizer trials in Quebec and Wisconsin to elaborate a machine learning model using minimum datasets. We tested carryover effects in a 5-year Quebec fertilizer experiment established on permanent plots. Micronutrients contributed more than macronutrients to variation in tissue compositions. Random Forest model related accurately current-year berry yield to location, cultivars, climatic indices, fertilization, and tissue and soil tests as features (classification accuracy of 0.83). Comparing compositions of defective and successful tissue compositions in the Euclidean space of tissue compositions, the general across-factor diagnosis differed from the local factor-specific diagnosis. Nutrient standards elaborated in one region could hardly be transposed to another and, within the same region, from one bed to another due to site-specific characteristics. Next-year yield and nutrient adjustment could be predicted accurately from current-year yield and tissue composition and other features, with R2 value of 0.73 in regression mode and classification accuracy of 0.85.

However, they oversimplify emissions accounting by assuming a zero or negative carbon emissions factor. Accounting for total lifecycle emissions is perhaps the greatest challenge in deploying biomass (in solid, gaseous, or liquid form) to reduce carbon emissions2,3. When utilized to generate electricity, emissions sinks and sources for biomass occur in two different sectors. As plants grow, they take up CO2 and store it. When combusted, the stored CO2 is released and contributes to emissions. Accordingly, counting the emissions factor for biomass electricity generation as zero, or negative in the case of BECCS, causes double-counting of emissions on a cross-sectoral basis4. These accounting challenges persist when developing national or international carbon control of adaptation. It is further essential to understand the interdependence of barriers within and across scales. Importantly, and this may be where we truly differ in our thinking from Biesbroek and colleagues, the barriers concept does not imply a top-down or simplistic linear framing of adaptation decision-making. Some case studies, for example, show how grandfathered water-use rights can impede autonomous adaptation by local and private actors4\u20136. Such water rights might stem from governmental policies or might be old traditions of self-organized user communities. Adjustments of such social norms or institutions are messy, non-linear and complex. We think that comparative research would be worthwhile to explain under which actorand context-specific conditions grandfathering rights systematically support or impede adaptations. Numerous further studies now analyse barriers with approaches that acknowledge complexity, unforeseen contingencies and dynamic processes7\u201311. Biesbroek et al. further suggest that focusing research on barriers implicitly entails the normative assumption that decision-making should result in adaptation. Quite to the contrary, we overtly decouple the definition of barriers from the discussion of adaptation success: \u201ca \u2018barrier to adaptation\u2019 is (1) an impediment (2) to specified adaptations (3) for specified actors in their given context that (4) arise from a condition or set of conditions. A barrier can be (5) valued differently by different actors, and (6) can, in principle, be reduced or overcome\u201d1. We thus explicitly state that barriers are in the eye of the beholder, and that some actors may well welcome perceived barriers. There is no claim that valuations are shared and conflict-free between actors. Thus, barrier research can deal with the issues raised by our colleagues in an analytically rigorous and practically relevant way without being tied to one particular normative view. We appreciate the Correspondence from Biesbroek et al. for emphasizing three aspects for furthering the research agenda on barriers to adaptation. First, we wholeheartedly agree that a better understanding of real-world adaptation policy and decision-making processes is absolutely essential if science is to explain barriers adequately and \u2014 maybe more importantly \u2014 usefully inform these societal processes. Second, research on identifying, explaining, and thus helping to deal with barriers, is not the same as adopting a functionalistic blackbox approach. The barriers concept is compatible with nuanced frameworks and theories of decision-making from different disciplinary perspectives, as many examples of published research have shown. Better use should be made of existing frameworks and theories in future adaptation research, for example from political, decision and cognitive sciences. Third, in our view, discarding the concept of barriers to climate change altogether would risk losing an important device for fruitful interaction: barriers serve as a \u2018boundary object\u2019, intuitively and widely understood by both practitioners and scholars from different disciplines. This fosters a key priority for the future: collaborative and comparative research that enhances transdisciplinary learning across cases, about empirically proven ways in which particular actors can deal with particular barriers to adaptation. This promises to be real-world research of potentially high academic and societal value. \u2750 References 1. Eisenack, K. et al. Nature Clim. Change 4, 867\u2013872 (2014). 2. Biesbroek, R. et al.

The durability of this type of sequestration depends entirely on the long-term geological integrity of the seal. There is a strong correlation between the change in water saturation and the change in CO2 saturation in a saline reservoir. Electromagnetic monitoring technology based on electromagnetic inversion has been widely used as a powerful supplement to expensive seismic methods in the CO2 sequestration monitoring field. Dissolved salt reacts with the CO2 to precipitate out as carbonates thereby changing the complex electrical resistivity. So, there is a direct correspondence between the change in saturation and the measured electric field on the ground surface, which makes electromagnetic (EM) methods very suitable for monitoring CO2 sequestration. Based on electromagnetic inversion, the monitoring method attempts to estimate the distribution of CO2 in the deep reservoir from observations on or above the ground to locate the plume position. In order to improve the resolution and detection depth of electromagnetic detection, we have developed a new method of joint inversion of electromagnetic induction polarization with Nano-enhancement technology and casing excitation technology. Inverse problems are usually posed as least-squares optimization problems in high-dimensional parameter spaces. The existing approache based on deterministic gradient-based methods is limited by the nonlinearity and no-uniqueness of the inverse problem. Probabilistic inversion method, despite its great potential in uncertainty quantification, still remains a formidable computational task. In this work, we explored the potential of deep learning methods for borehole-to-surface electromagnetic (BSEM) inversion. This method has a natural advantage that does not require calculation of gradients and provides immediate results. Deep convolutional neural network based on U-net architecture is trained on large synthetic datasets obtained by our full 3-D BSEM Code. This method has been verified on the practical model of the typical onshore borehole-to-surface controlled source CO2 monitoring scenario. Pre-trained networks can reliably estimate the location and lateral dimensions of the CO2 plume, as well as their complex resistivity properties. We also compared several fully convolutional network architectures in terms of generalization, accuracy, timeliness and training cost. The feasibility of the deep learning inversion has been further confirmed from examples with different survey geometry and noise, which opens the possibility to estimate the complex resistivity distribution of the Deep CO2 sequestration in real time.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "64ed57921c946fc8d67169bedcee943882846307", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2987103915", "DOI": "10.12783/dteees/iceee2019/31761", "CorpusId": 209173278}, "title": "Techno-economics of CO2-Argon-Steam Oxy-Fuel (CARSOXY) Gas Turbines", "abstract": "Due to strict emission control regulations on gas turbines, power generation industries are liable for maintaining CO2 and NOx emission levels within allowable tolerance margins.

Most projected pathways toward meeting those targets include a large contribution from carbon capture and storage. Many capture technologies impose a large energy penalty to separate and compress carbon dioxide (CO2 ). Also, injected neat CO2 in a deep saline aquifer is buoyant compared to the aquifer brine and requires an impermeable seal to prevent it from escaping the aquifer. An alternative technology was recently proposed by Heberle and Edwards [1] that burns coal in supercritical water pumped from a saline aquifer. The entire effluent stream is sequestered, capturing all carbon and non-mineral coal combustion products in the process. This stream is denser than the aquifer brine and therefore offers a higher level of storage security, and can utilize aquifers without suitable structural trapping. This technology also increases energy security in the U.S., allowing for the use of its coal resources while avoiding atmospheric pollution. In this paper, a complete architecture employing supercritical water oxidation is proposed, including a liquid-oxygen-pumped air separation unit and regenerator system that heats and desalinates the incoming brine. A thermodynamic model calculates the overall thermal efficiency of the plant, including all separation and storage energy penalties. In addition, an exergy analysis gives insights into the least efficient parts of the proposed system. The details and assumptions of the model are discussed. Insights from the model and these analyses elucidate how the proposed system may be operated as a zero-emission electricity source and the technical challenges that must be addressed for deployment.Copyright \u00a9 2011 by ASME", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "02cb8a8740a48979737e2fb5f0e96011d75db1e4", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3390/en15020672", "CorpusId": 246052450}, "title": "Analysis of Available Conditions for InSAR Surface Deformation Monitoring in CCS Projects", "abstract": "Carbon neutrality is a goal the world is striving to achieve in the context of global warming.

Two technologies that show promise for CCUS application are enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and enhanced gas recovery (EGR), where CO2 is used as a working fluid to extract oil and natural gas respectively from depleted reservoirs. Permanent carbon sequestration is achieved as a byproduct due to subsurface fluid losses throughout the life of the system. In this chapter, numerical simulations of subsurface flow in EOR are conducted using the multiphase flow solver COZSim. For EGR simulations, the TOUGH2 (Transport of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat) code is employed. An optimization code based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm is combined with COZSim and TOUGH2 and modified for EOR and EGR application respectively. Using GA-COZSim and GA-TOUGH2, the CO2 injection rates are optimized for both constant mass and constant pressure injection scenarios to manage the production of methane or oil for EGR and EOR respectively to ensure high output for the entire life of the system thus allowing for more efficient use of CO2.

Up to 97% of the initially purchased CO2 for EOR operations can be stored at the end of injection.

The capture of CO2 could be done by direct air capture, or capturing CO2 from biogenic sources. Amine absorption is the state-of-the-art method to capture CO2, but it has some drawbacks: toxicity, high heat demand, and sorbent sensitivity towards impurities such as sulfur compounds and degradation in cyclic operation. Another potential solvent for CO2 could be water, which is easily available and safe to use in many applications. The problem with water is the poorer solubility of CO2, compared with amines, which leads to larger required flow rates. This study analyzed the technical feasibility of water absorption in a counterflow bubble column reactor. A dynamic, one-dimensional multiphase model was developed. The gas phase was modeled with plug flow assumption, and the liquid phase was treated as axially dispersed plug flow. CO2 capture efficiency, produced CO2 mass flow rate, and the product gas CO2 content were estimated as a function of inlet gas and liquid flow rate. In addition, the energy consumption per produced CO2-tonne was calculated. The CO2 capture efficiency was improved by increasing the liquid flow rate, while the CO2 content in product gas was decreased.

Thereby no single process can be considered as a comprehensive solution. Indeed, any developed technologies, in turn, have a contribution to the reduction of CO2 concentration. Extensive research needs to be done to assess and decrease NETs costs and limitations.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "fee8e4a88ba660cc8bbc7e4235b5e581e8baf00e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3174739077", "DOI": "10.1071/sr20040", "CorpusId": 237850659}, "title": "Quantifying blue carbon and nitrogen stocks in surface soils of temperate coastal wetlands", "abstract": "\nCoastal wetlands are carbon and nutrient sinks that capture large amounts of atmospheric CO2 and runoff of nutrients. \u2018Blue carbon\u2019 refers to carbon stored within resident vegetation (e.g. mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) and soil of coastal wetlands.

The region has annual CO{sub 2} emissions of about 265 million metric tonnes (292 million tons), primarily from 122 coal-fired electric generation facilities, some of which burn almost 4.5 million tonnes (5 million tons) of coal per year (U.S. Department of Energy, 2010). Validation Phase (Phase II) field tests gathered pilot data to update the Characterization Phase (Phase I) assessment of options for capture, transportation, and storage of CO{sub 2} emissions in three geological sink types: coal seams, oil fields, and saline reservoirs. Four small-scale field tests were conducted to determine the properties of rock units that control injectivity of CO{sub 2}, assess the total storage resources, examine the security of the overlying rock units that act as seals for the reservoirs, and develop ways to control and measure the safety of injection and storage processes. The MGSC designed field test operational plans for pilot sites based on the site screening process, MVA program needs, the selection of equipment related to CO{sub 2} injection,more\u00a0\u00bb and design of a data acquisition system. Reservoir modeling, computational simulations, and statistical methods assessed and interpreted data gathered from the field tests. Monitoring, Verification, and Accounting (MVA) programs were established to detect leakage of injected CO{sub 2} and ensure public safety. Public outreach and education remained an important part of the project; meetings and presentations informed public and private regional stakeholders of the results and findings. A miscible (liquid) CO{sub 2} flood pilot project was conducted in the Clore Formation sandstone (Mississippian System, Chesterian Series) at Mumford Hills Field in Posey County, southwestern Indiana, and an immiscible CO{sub 2} flood pilot was conducted in the Jackson sandstone (Mississippian System Big Clifty Sandstone Member) at the Sugar Creek Field in Hopkins County, western Kentucky.

A pilot project at the Tanquary Farms site in Wabash County, southeastern Illinois, tested the potential storage of CO{sub 2} in the Springfield Coal Member of the Carbondale Formation (Pennsylvanian System), in order to gauge the potential for large-scale CO{sub 2} storage and/or enhanced coal bed methane recovery from Illinois Basin coal beds. The pilot results from all four sites showed that CO{sub 2} could be injected into the subsurface without adversely affecting groundwater. Additionally, hydrocarbon production was enhanced, giving further evidence that CO{sub 2} storage in oil reservoirs and coal beds offers an economic advantage. Results from the MVA program at each site indicated that injected CO{sub 2} did not leave the injection zone. Topical reports were completed on the Middle and Late Devonian New Albany Shale and Basin CO{sub 2} emissions. The efficacy of the New Albany Shale as a storage sink could be substantial if low injectivity concerns can be alleviated.

The results indicate that the impacts are larger in the lower bound emission pathway to achieve 4.5 W/m2 as expected, although the economy and energy demand increase continuously in this century. However, the global primary energy demand in 2100 in the lower bound case is slightly larger than in the mean case; this can be interpreted because biomass energy with carbon capture and storage technology is enhanced to achieve very low carbon dioxide emissions in the lower bound case. In a comparison between the upper bound and lower bound emission pathways, the carbon price of the latter is approximately three times higher in 2100. The gross domestic product (GDP) in the latter is 4.1% smaller than that in the former in 2100, which is equivalent to only a 0.042% decrease in the annual GDP growth rate.

The main aim of this research is to develop a thermodynamic model from an accurate equation of state (EoS) for typical components of reservoir fluids and flue gases. The SAFT-VR Mie EoS was selected to study the phase behaviour and transport properties of mixtures related to carbon capture and storage (CCS). Four EoSs have been compared (PR, SRK, PC-SAFT and SAFT-VR Mie) by modelling density and vapour-liquid equilibria (VLE) data from the literature of 22 pure components and 108 binary systems of gases (CO2, H2S, N2, O2, Ar, CO and SO2), nalkanes and aromatics. Isothermal vapour-liquid equilibrium of H2S Ar binary system was determined experimentally at three temperatures from 273 to 323 K. Densities of five H2S binary systems (three CH4-H2S systems with 13, 18 and 28 % of acid gas, C2H6 34% H2S and C3H8 13% H2S) were measured continuously at 3 temperatures (253, 273 and 293 K) and at pressures up to 30MPa, using a vibrating tube densitometer, Anton Paar DMA 512. Following the same technique, the density of the ternary system 42% CO2, 40% CH4 and 18% H2S was measured at pressures ranging from 0.2 to 31.5 MPa and at 6 temperatures between 253 and 353 K. Three transport properties were modelled with SAFT-VR Mie and two models based on density predictions from the EoS. Density, viscosity and interfacial tension (IFT) of CO2-rich systems were calculated by the SAFT-EoS (density), TRAPP model (viscosity) and DGT (IFT), for system of interest to CCS. Densities and viscosities of a multicomponent mixture of 50% CO2, 40% CH4 and 10% of other impurities were measured at 5 temperatures between 283 and 423 K and at 2.5-150 MPa pressure range, using an Anton Paar densitometer and the capillary tube technique for viscosity measurements.

However significant uncertainties remain concerning the drivers and constraints of the available biomass, the overall greenhouse gas (GHG) benefit, and the most effective supply and demand chains. This thesis builds on the IMAGE integrated assessment model in order to improve the representation of the supply of biomass from different sources and its use in different end use sectors. Improvements include (i) representation of residue costs and supply as a function of agricultural and forestry demand, (ii) investigation of the spatially explicit GHG consequences of energy crop production and how increased production of biofuels affects overall carbon balances, (iii) representation of the long term energy demand and emissions of (bio)chemicals and effects of post-consumer-waste options such as recycling and cascading, and (iv) updating the techno-economic parameterization of different biomass conversion technologies and investigating how different biomass end uses compete with each other and the consequences on GHG mitigation. The improved model is used in order to conduct a scenario analysis covering a broad set of uncertainties concerning the future development of the land and energy systems. The scenarios are differentiated along socioeconomic lines (population growth, globalisation/regionalisation, technological improvements, lifestyle choices, etc.) as well as the application of policies aimed at meeting stringent climate targets, thus presenting a broad overview of different possible futures. The results show that though residues can play an important role in biomass supply (up to 50 EJPrim/yr), the main uncertainty concerning low GHG biomass availability is the development of agricultural production. With increased intensification and land abandonment large volumes of biomass can be produced with small effects on GHG emissions (up to 100 EJPrim/yr with an emission factor below 20 kgCO2/GJPrim). Bioenergy use is driven by fuel demand for transport or heating; however its most effective use (from a GHG perspective) is projected to be electricity production due to the continuing growth and high emissions of this sector. Small volumes are also demanded for the production of chemicals; however the emission mitigation potential of this sector is very small. Land management and technological improvements in second generation biofuel production as well as carbon capture and storage are critical in order to meet stringent climate targets. Overall biomass and bioenergy can contribute up to a quarter of final energy demand and plays a crucial role at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

This is driven by the use of energy, which until recently has mostly derived from fossil fuel, though a number of countries have shown a decoupling of GDP growth and greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector through rapid increases in low carbon energy generation. Nevertheless, as low carbon energy technologies are implemented over the coming decades, fossil fuels will continue to have a vital role in providing energy to drive the global economy.

The expanded IECM will be used to help identify the most promising new options and R&D goals for advanced capture technologies. Introduction To mitigate climate change, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a key technology option for deeply cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuel power plants [1]. Adding today\u2019s amine-based CCS to pulverized coal (PC) power plants for 90% CO2 capture would increase the plant cost of generating electricity by roughly 70% to 80% and incur an energy penalty of about 25% to 40% [2]. Thus, there is a strong research focus on developing advanced capture processes having lower energy penalties and lower overall cost than current systems. Given a wide range of activities and approaches to advanced carbon capture, there is a strong need for a system-level analysis to provide \u201ca common ground\u201d to evaluate emergent carbon capture technologies. Background The systems model will employ and substantially expand the Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM) framework developed by Carnegie Mellon University [3]. This model, rooted in fundamental mass and energy balance principles, can be used to conduct comparative analyses of emergent capture technology options for different types of power plants, including rigorous treatment and analysis of uncertainties, which are especially prevalent in emerging technologies. Annual Report to the Stanford University Global Climate and Energy Project (GCEP) A core element of this project is the development of models to characterize several emerging CO2 capture processes being developed with GCEP funds by other university research teams. These involve the use of materials including ionic liquids (ILs) for precombustion capture (University of Notre Dame), and metal organic frameworks (MOFs) (Northwestern University) and biomimetic sorbents (Stanford University) for postcombustion capture. In this project we propose to substantially expand the IECM to explicitly include models of these advanced CO2 capture processes, plus the capability to include a life cycle analysis of substances used for CO2 capture. Results to Date The team started with researching such new materials as ILs and MOFs used for CO2 capture. As elaborated below, the team has assessed the status of available data on material properties and process in consultation with other GCEP researchers and developed preliminary technical and economic models for capture processes. All the models are currently coded in the MATLAB environment. Results for Absorption Processes This section report our research results to date on ILs, which employ physical or chemical absorption processes to capture CO2 from a mixed gas stream. Development of a Multistage Equilibrium Model for Gas Absorption Absorption of CO2 using ILs is considered as a steady-state vapor-liquid process consisting of a number of stages. Equilibrium is assumed to take place between vapor and liquid streams leaving each stage. A multi-stage equilibrium model is established to simulate the absorption process. As discussed below, the multi-stage process model takes into account the mass balance (M), equilibrium (E), summation (S), and enthalpy balance (H). The Newton-Raphson simultaneous correction algorithm is applied to solve the MESH equations and then provide the profiles of vapor and liquid compositions and temperatures across all equilibrium stages.

Recent progress in DACCS commercialization suggests it could be a viable means of removing CO2 from the atmosphere with far lower land intensity than bioenergy with carbon capture or afforestation but with higher energy demands. Several forms of DACCS are in development, with different costs and energy inputs, as well as potential for future cost and performance improvements. Here, we use the Global Change Analysis Model to understand the role of DACCS across all 5 SSPs for the below 2 \u00b0C and below 1.5 \u00b0C end-of-century warming goals. We assess DACCS deployment relative to other carbon capture methods, and its side effects for global energy, water, land systems. We find that DACCS could play up to a tens of GtCO2 yr\u22121 role in many of these scenarios, particularly those with delayed climate policy and/or higher challenges to emissions mitigation. Our \u2018sustainable development\u2019 scenarios, consistent with SSP1, have smaller deployments of DACCS and other negative emissions owing to immediate climate policy onset, greater ease of emissions abatement, and tighter constraints on future negative emissions.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "bfdce1b4b2e6382e7536d6b840b7f796c25c7211", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2921441550", "DOI": "10.1017/S0885715619000010", "CorpusId": 85553729}, "title": "First-principles study of carbon capture and storage properties of porous MnO2 octahedral molecular sieve OMS-5", "abstract": "Based on the experimentally determined framework structure of porous MnO2 octahedral molecular sieve (OMS)-5, we used density functional theory-based calculations to evaluate the effect of Na+ cation on pore dimensionality and structural stability, and the interaction between CO2 and OMS-5.

One among them is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), but the capture process is very energy intensive. Here, a novel pathway is introduced, based on second generation biofuels followed by carbon circulation in an indefinitely closed chain, effectively resulting in a sink. Instead of using an energy-intensive conventional CCS process, the application of an on-board solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) running on biofuels in an electric vehicle (FCEV) could result in negative emissions by capturing a concentrated stream of CO2, which is readily stored in a second tank. A CO2 recovery system at the fuel station then takes the CO2 from the tank to be transported to storage locations or to be used for local applications such as CO2-based concrete curing and synthesis of e-fuels. Incorporating CO2 utilization technologies into the FCEVs-SOFC system can close the carbon loop, achieving carbon neutrality through feeding the CO2 in a reverse-logistic to a methanol plant. The methanol produced is also used in SOFC\u2019s, leading to an infinite repetition of this carbon cycle till a saturation stage is reached. It is determined this pathway will reach typical Cradle-to-Grave negative emissions of 0.515 ton CO2 per vehicle, and total negative CO2 emission of 138 Mt for all passenger cars in the EU is potentially achievable.

Reactive transport modeling is an essential tool for improving our understanding of basalt-water-CO2 interaction, plan and optimize existing and new storage sites. One of the main challenges in modeling reactive transport of CO2 in basalt is the large number of primary and secondary reactions and in the uncertainties associated with the input parameters.

Many countries are now considering putting a tax on CO2 emissions that will increase the cost of products that are associated with those emissions. The most common method currently considered for dealing with CO2 emissions is the capture of the gas, pressurization, and then sequestration in either rock formations or saline aquifers. This is relatively costly in both capital investment and operation of the equipment. Also, there is the possibility that this CO2 will escape at some point in the future subjecting the company in question to an uncertain risk. Ceramatec has been investigating an alternative approach that converts the CO2 into a useful product that can then be sold. Using solid oxide fuel cell materials in conjunction with a non-carbon source of energy it is possible to generate synthesis gas (CO and H2) and oxygen from CO2 and H2O. SCPV (Solar Concentrator Photovoltaic) systems are the most efficient generators of solar electricity and generate high quality heat at the same time. HTCE (High Temperature Co-electrolysis) uses both the solar electricity and the heat to electrolyze the CO2 and H2O at double the total cycle efficiency of traditional electrolysis. The synthesis gas that is produced can be used to produce synthetic fuels such as synthetic natural gas or Fischer Tropsch liquid fuels, or chemicals. This paper will discuss this alternative approach to the disposal of CO2. This approach has the following advantages: permanent disposal, usable product, storage of solar energy in fuel, reduction of GHG, reduction in solar radiation, and no additional GHG.", "year": 2010}]}
