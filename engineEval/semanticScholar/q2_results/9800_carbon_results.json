This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the influence of long-term application of different fertilizers and straw retention on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, to compare the calculated response ratios with Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-recommended default relative stock change factors, and to propose recommendations for enhancing SOC sequestration. The meta-analysis indicated that the long-term application of chemical fertilizers (CF), organic fertilizers (OF), combined chemical and organic fertilizers (CFOF), and straw return (SR) significantly enhanced the SOC storage. Response ratios varied significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) across different fertilization measures and climatic zones, and was sensitive to the initial SOC content. The mean response ratio was 0.94 for no fertilizer (NF), 1.08 for CF, 1.48 for OF, 1.38 for CFOF, and 1.28 for SR. When IPCC default values for response ratios were applied, SOC storage with OF and CFOF treatments in warm temperate regions with a dry climate was underestimated by 26%, and in the cool temperate region with a moist climate was overestimated by 25% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Analysis showed that sustained application of organic fertilizers and straw return could be a beneficial measures to mitigate climate change and ensure food security in China.

Sustaining Ohio\u2019s current coal-based power production while transitioning to a low-emissions economy will require the state to develop and introduce strategies for carbon capture and geologic storage, possibly in conjunction with CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR). Collectively these are referred to as carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). Ohio\u2019s oil and gas reservoirs may store between 205 and 878 million metric tonnes CO2 [Battelle, 2016], which is 2.6 to 5.2 times the 79 million tonnes of CO2 emitted from Ohio\u2019s power sector in 2016 [U.S. EPA, 2017]. To date, no large-scale CCUS operations have been conducted in Ohio. This allows time to develop a focused strategy to implement CCUS by building on similar projects outside the state while tailoring to local geography, geology, and risks. As part of the strategy, a field-specific risk framework for CCUS in depleted oilfields has been created. This presentation will describe the method used to conduct risk assessments and the results of risk assessments for potential CCUS projects at three legacy oilfields in Ohio. The fields are the East Canton Consolidated Oilfield, Morrow Consolidated Oilfield, and Gore Consolidated Oilfield with 3,483, 898, and 5992 wells, respectively. Field-scale well integrity studies have had to rely largely on historical data to assess the potential for fluid leakage related to CCUS projects. Several groups have developed methods to identify risky wells that may need to be monitored or remediated. These methods serve as analogs for determining the frequency of wellbore leakage in other fields. Methods to assess well integrity can be qualitative, semi-quantitative, or quantitative. This study defined risk as the product of the likelihood of occurrence and the severity of occurrence of leakage (Equation 1). Where Risk and Severity of occurrence are in US dollars Risk = Likelihood of leakage * Severity of occurrence [Equation 1] The risk framework described in this study uses the bow-tie method with features, events, and processes (FEPs) to identify and assess risk posed by legacy wells.

CCS (Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage) technology, which is one of the most effective CO2 discharge control technologies, is expected to suppress the CO2 emission into the atmosphere. There are several options for the storage in CCS. Geological storage is one of the options but is the most feasible. Monitoring is essential and necessary not only for the accountability of the CO2 storage but also the safety of the CO2 injection. The operation from the critical damage should also be planned in the case of an abnormal monitoring data. The seismic reflection method is often used in the CO2 storage sites because most of the sites are in the oil/gas fields and the seismic reflection is the most popular and fundamental survey method in the petroleum field. However, seismic velocity does not change at the proportion of the CO2 saturation change in the laboratory test (Nakatsuka et al., 2009), indicating that the seismic velocity decreases rapidly during the CO2 injection but the no remarkable decrease is detected after the CO2 saturation up to about 30% . Moreover the seismic reflection method is expensive to carry out. To overcome these disadvantages of the seismic monitoring we have started a research work using the electromagnetic phenomena. Monitoring using geoelectric method was applied to an air injection and the increase of the geoelectric potential was observed. We have been monitoring earth-surface SP during gas injection tests at various sites in Japan. When air was injected into a 100-meter well within a geothermal field, a remarkable simultaneous increase in SP centered on the wellhead was observed. To explain the increase of the geoelectric potential, theoretical analysis was carried out.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "6fe15c7deee5c61f2cfc7b7fd1f90e60629128d6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1229326473", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1004315012337", "CorpusId": 41581467}, "title": "Impact of elevated CO2 on the metabolic diversity of microbial communities in N-limited grass swards", "abstract": "The impact of elevated atmospheric CO2 on qualitative and qua ntitative changes in rhizosphere carbon flow will have important consequences fo r nutrient cycling and storage in soil, through the effect on the activity, biom ass size and composition of soil microbial communities. We hypothesized that mic robial communities from the rhizosphere of Danthonia richardsonii, a n ative C3 Australian grass, growing at ambient and twice ambient CO2 a nd varying rates of low N application (20, 60, 180 kg N ha-1) will be different as a consequence of qualitative and quantitative change in rhizosphere carbon flow. We used the BiologTM system to construct sole carbon source utilisation profiles of these communities from the rhizosphere of D. richardsonii. BiologTM GN and MT plates, the latter to which more ecologically relevant root exudate carbon sources were added, were used to characterise the communities. Microbial communities from the rhizosphere of D. richardsonii grown for four years at twice ambient CO2 had significantly greater utilisation of all carbon sources except those with a low C:N ratio (neutral and acidic amino acids, amides, N-heterocycles, long chain aliphatic acids) than communities from plants grown at ambient CO2. This indicates a change in microbial community composition suggesting that under elevated CO2 compounds with a higher C:N ratio were exuded. Enumeration of microorganisms, using plate counts, indicated that there was a preferential stimulation of fungal growth at elevated CO2 and confirmed that bacterial metabolic activity (C utilisation rates), not population size (counts), were stimulated by additional C flow at elevated CO2. Nitrogen was an additional rate-limiting factor for microbial growth in soil and had a significant impact on the microbial response to elevated CO2. Microbial populations were higher in the rhizosphere of plants receiving the highest N application, but the communities receiving the lowest N application were most active. These results have important implications for carbon turnover and storage in soils where changes in soil microbial community structure and stimulation of the activity of microorganisms which prefer to grow on rhizodeposits may lead to a decrease in the composition of organic matter and result in an accumulation of soil carbon.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "dde9b58ac6e40d9c5c14f619210c1434d44f5a3c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2961945276", "DOI": "10.1007/s11356-019-05842-3", "CorpusId": 195880467, "PubMed": "31292871"}, "title": "The feasibility of cost-effective manufacturing activated carbon derived from walnut shells for large-scale CO2 capture", "abstract": "The economic potential of activated carbon (AC) synthesis from walnut shell biomass for CO2 capture was evaluated in the present study.

The 15 identified trees were randomly sampled within a stratum of 10x10km shared into 24 plots for proper analyses using i-Tree Eco v6.0.23 software. The following data were captured and analyzed; Photosynthetically Active Radiation, Rain/Precipitation, Temperature, Transpiration, Evaporation, Water Intercepted by trees, Avoided Runoff by trees, Potential Evaporation by trees, Isoprene and Monoterpene by trees. This study also further discusses the tree benefits of green, low carbon, and sustainable environment within the context of biodiversity conservation considering carbon storage, carbon sequestration, hydrology effects, pollution removal, oxygen production, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Quantifying the storage in floodplains is crucial to understand their role in the sediment and carbon cascades. Unfortunately, quantitative data on floodplain storage are limited, especially at larger spatial scales. Rivers in the Scottish Highlands can provide a special case to study alluvial sediment and carbon dynamics because of the dominance of peatlands throughout the landscape, but the alluvial history of the region remains poorly understood. In this study, the floodplain sediment and soil organic carbon storage is quantified for the mountainous headwaters of the River Dee in eastern Scotland (663\u2009km2), based on a coring dataset of 78 floodplain cross\u2010sections. Whereas the mineral sediment storage is dominated by wandering gravel\u2010bed river sections, most of the soil organic carbon storage can be found in anastomosing and meandering sections. The total storage for the Upper Dee catchment can be estimated at 5.2 Mt or 2306.5\u2009Mg\u2009ha\u20101 of mineral sediment and 0.7 Mt or 323.3\u2009Mg C ha\u20101 of soil organic carbon, which is in line with other studies on temperate river systems. Statistical analysis indicates that the storage is mostly related to the floodplain slope and the geomorphic floodplain type, which incorporates the characteristic stream power, channel morphology and the deposit type. Mapping of the geomorphic floodplain type using a simple classification scheme shows to be a powerful tool in studying the total storage and local variability of mineral sediment and soil organic carbon in floodplains. \u00a9 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "67633338c5aaf260856c8b5a0af3f47a6d43f900", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2872669953", "DOI": "10.1016/J.CHERD.2018.07.004", "CorpusId": 105913475}, "title": "Process simulation of dehydration unit for the comparative analysis of natural gas processing and carbon capture application", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "e653da1d98943b9d46f906be0806eb45d7588541", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2744132358", "DOI": "10.1007/s00253-017-8455-6", "CorpusId": 32517326, "PubMed": "28801795"}, "title": "Storage lipid and polysaccharide metabolism in Yarrowia lipolytica and Umbelopsis isabellina", "abstract": "Complex biochemical mechanisms are being involved in oleaginous microorganisms during storage lipid and polysaccharide metabolism. Detailed biochemical analyses and monitoring of key enzymes involved in carbon metabolism were performed in Yarrowia lipolytica and Umbelopsis isabellina, which are often used as model oleaginous microorganisms. It was found that during the early oleaginous phase, the carbon source (glucose) was channeled to lipid accumulation, but also to polysaccharide biosynthesis. However, during transition from the early to the late oleaginous phase, glucose was exclusively converted to lipids, while in U. isabellina, but not in Y. lipolytica, an additional conversion of cellular polysaccharides into lipids was observed. After glucose depletion in the growth medium, cellular storage material was degraded either for generating maintenance energy or for supporting further microbial growth, depending on the availability of essential nutrients in the growth medium. We demonstrated that in both microorganisms, reserve lipids were exclusively used as an intra-cellular carbon source in order to generate energy for maintenance purpose. When cellular storage material degradation was related to new cell mass production, a bioconversion of lipids into new lipid-free material, consisting of polysaccharides and proteins, was observed in Y. lipolytica, while new lipid-free material in U. isabellina was richer in proteins. Lipid and polysaccharide remodeling may occur in some cases in both microorganisms.

Here, we generated an unmarked, in-frame deletion mutant of csrA to assess its contribution to H. ducreyi pathogenesis. In human inoculation experiments, the csrA mutant was partially attenuated for pustule formation compared to its parent. Deletion of csrA resulted in decreased adherence of H. ducreyi to human foreskin fibroblasts (HFF); Flp1 and Flp2, the determinants of H. ducreyi adherence to HFF cells, were downregulated in the csrA mutant. Compared to its parent, the csrA mutant had a significantly reduced ability to tolerate oxidative stress and heat shock. The enhanced sensitivity of the mutant to oxidative stress was more pronounced in bacteria grown to stationary phase compared to that in bacteria grown to mid-log phase. The csrA mutant also had a significant survival defect within human macrophages when the bacteria were grown to stationary phase but not to mid-log phase. Complementation in trans partially or fully restored the mutant phenotypes.

This report deals with the development of a methodology for estimating cost-curves of carbon sequestration from afforestation activities and its combination with existing cost-curves of carbon abatement in the energy sector, with an application to the Latin American region. For deriving the carbon supply curves, a bottom-up approach is used where the costs of carbon sequestration are first estimated on individual grids (geo-referenced area of 50 \u00d7 50 km), which are aggregated in a single cost curve. In evaluating the carbon sequestration benefits of forests, we intend to capture the lifecycle of the sequestered carbon by accounting the carbon uptake during forest growth, the carbon emissions during the harvest periods, and the residual carbon storage in short-and longlived products. From a number of model runs we show that (i) the cumulative carbon sequestration by 2010 could amount to about one fourth of the yearly emissions in the region\u2019s energy sector, given a carbon price of US$20/tC, (ii) the Latin American region on its own could fulfil the Kyoto Protocol demand on Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) sinks for 2008-2012 at a carbon price of US$26-32/tC, and (iii) when the supply curves of afforestation and energy are combined, the total emission reductions in 2010 are at least 15% larger than in the case of the energy sector alone.

It has been accepted that the main objective of natural analogue studies is to predict the long-term performance of a natural CO2 reservoir to be extrapolated to the operation of a CO2 deep geological storage, but these studies can also provide valuable information to select a site for CO2 storage. Thus, the comprehensive study performed in this Spanish basin has allowed the establishment of a guide to be applied to other similar natural systems with deep saline aquifers that are able to store CO2. This guide comprises 5 phases: (1) the compilation of existing information from the site; (2) the geological and structural study of the natural CO2 reservoir; (3) the characterisation of the main components (waters\u2013rocks\u2013gases) of the natural CO2 reservoir; (4) the identification of analogies between the natural CO2 reservoir and a potential site for CO2 geological storage; and (5) the implications for the long-term behaviour and safety of a CO2 storage system. Whilst the three first stages are well known since they are exclusively focused on the site characterisation, the latter two are poorly developed. For this reason, it has been considered convenient to go deeper into both the identification of analogies and the assessment of their performance in storing CO2.

The many-electron problem was taken into account using statistical methods: a modified independent event model was used for pure (direct) and simultaneous target and projectile ionizations, and the independent particle model for pure electron capture and electron capture accompanied by target ionization. Results are presented for double differential cross sections (DDCS) for total electron emission by carbon projectile impact on neon. For the water target, we present the following: single differential cross sections (SDCS) and DDCS for single target ionization; total cross sections (TCS) for electron emission; TCS for the pure single electronic interactions; equilibrium charge state fractions; and stopping cross sections. The results were found to be in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data in many cases, including DDCS and SDCS for the single target ionization, TCS for the total electron emission and TCS for the pure single electron capture. The stopping cross sections of this work are consistent with the other model calculations for projectile energies \u2265800\u00a0keV u(-1), but smaller than the other calculations at lower energies. The discrepancy arises from the inclusion of all carbon charge states and coupling between electron capture and target ionization channels, while other models use an average projectile charge. The CTMC model presented here provides a tool for cross section calculations for low and intermediate energy carbon projectiles. The calculated cross sections are required for Monte Carlo track structure simulations of full-slowing-down tracks of carbon ions.

The high concentration of clay minerals contribute to the high intrinsic anisotropy (e.g., velocity, strength, permeability, and resistivity changes with direction) of mudstones. This high anisotropy complicates, among other things, seismic interpretation for hydrocarbon exploration and production, as well as predictions on the mechanical behaviour of these clayrich rocks. Mudstones are also characterized by a low-permeability matrix, which makes it difficult for fluids to flow through the rock. This impermeable character of mudstones makes them a potential natural seal for long-term CO2 storage and a potential host rock for nuclear waste disposal. For hydrocarbon production, open fractures are needed to enhance the productivity of oil and gas reservoirs, whereas the presence of such fractures can result in unwanted leakage of CO2 or nuclear waste in the subsurface. Fracture formation depends on, among other things, the mechanical properties of the mudstone. It is thus important to understand the elastic anisotropy and mechanical properties of mudstones for successful hydrocarbon exploration and production, and to safely store CO2 and radioactive waste in the subsurface. Although mudstones are important in the energy sector, the understanding of their elastic anisotropy and deformation behaviour under various physical conditions is limited, due to their complex character and the lack of laboratory experiments performed on well-preserved samples.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "06ad1caf976163baf6ae5f5ab6bab70f5a951515", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3120696370", "DOI": "10.1144/petgeo2020-136", "CorpusId": 233586141}, "title": "Fault and top seals thematic collection: a perspective", "abstract": "Predicting the sealing capacity of faults and caprocks has been a long-standing uncertainty for those involved in the exploration, appraisal and development of petroleum reservoirs.

Several technologies are being proposed for the capture and utilization of carbon dioxide. However its high thermodynamic stability makes its conversion very difficult. Hence, catalyst aided conversion of carbon dioxide to value added products are of high relevance. For instance, the synthesis of cyclic carbonate from epoxide and carbon dioxide helps avoid the use of toxic gases like phosgene or CO and at the same time represents an ideal atomeconomic process. Cyclic carbonate find uses as solvents, electrolytes in lithium-ion batteries, precursors for polycarbonates and other polymeric materials, as green solvents, as chemical intermediates and pharmaceuticals. In the past, several homogeneous catalysts such as quaternary ammonium salts, metal halides, and metal complexes were reported to be efficient in the synthesis of cyclic carbonates. However, the difficulty associated with the catalyst recyclability demands highly efficient heterogeneous catalysts. Many heterogeneous catalysts such as metal oxides, zeolites, titanosilicates and ion-exchanged resins are developed with the necessity of harsh reaction conditions. Over the past few years many groups including ours have been focused on the cycloaddition reaction of CO2 with epoxides using ionic liquid supported materials such as silica, polystyrene and biopolymers [2]. Even though they are catalytically active, leaching of active species is very common. Very recently metal organic frameworks are emerging as new catalysts for this conversion [3-5]. Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a class of porous crystalline organic-inorganic hybrids that extends in 1-, 2or 3-D. Characteristic properties of MOFs include accessible pore volumes, ordered pores, high internal surface area, high adsorption capacity, diverse means of functionalization etc. MOFs are excellent materials for gas storage and separation such as methane, hydrogen, CO2 etc. [6]. Whereas methane and hydrogen are used as fuels, the post-capture treatment of CO2 (such as sequestration) may require extra burden of desorption. By employing MOFs as catalyst for CO2 transformation, this could be circumvented. This lecture discusses the recent advancements in MOF catalysts for cyclic carbonate synthesis.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "60340a387c0cee0fb7e2744d8e9829897851ee09", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2945955074", "DOI": "10.1109/GTDASIA.2019.8716012", "CorpusId": 155108041}, "title": "Management of Mobile Energy Generation and Storage System", "abstract": "As the global demand for energy increases, new technologies are needed to satisfy the necessity for the electrical network growth.

Combustion of fossil fuel is claimed to be the major cause of excess CO2 emission into the atmosphere, but human society will still rely heavily on fossil fuel for energy and feedstock supplements. In order to mitigate the environment-energy crisis and achieve a sustainable developing mode, Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS) is an effective method and attracts considerable interests. Rather than conventional aqueous amine-based liquid absorbent, e.g. the toxic, corrosive and energy intensive monoethanolamine (MEA), solid adsorbents are preferable for CO2 capture. CO2 utilization via CO2 conversion to fuel or other value-added products is favored over CO2 storage. Also it is preferred that no transportation of captured CO2 is required. Capturing and converting CO2 to fuel, such as synthetic natural gas or CH4 is particularly useful if it is produced at the site of CO2 generation. The converted CO2 can then be recycled to the inlet of the power plant or integrated into existed fuel infrastructure eliminating any transportation. This thesis presents a study of the development, performance and characterizations of a newly discovered (second generation) dual functional material (DFM) for CO2 capture and catalytic conversion to methane in two separated steps. This material consists of Ru as the methanation catalyst and \u201cNa2O\u201d obtained from Na2CO3 hydrogenation as the CO2 adsorbent, both of which are deposited on the high surface area \u03b3-Al2O3 support. The Ru, \u201cNa2O\u201d DFM captures CO2 from O2and steam-containing flue gas at temperature from 250 \u00b0C to 350 \u00b0C in step 1 and converts it to synthetic natural gas (CH4) at the same temperature with addition of H2 produced from excess renewable energy (solar and/or wind energy) in step 2. The heat generated from methanation drives adsorbed CO2 to Ru by spillover from the adsorption sites and diffuse to Ru for methanation. This approach utilizes the heat in the flue gas for both adsorption and methanation therefore eliminating the need of external energy input. The second generation DFM was developed with a screening process of solid adsorbent candidates. Initial adsorption studies were conducted with powdered samples for CO2 capture capacity, methanation capability, and resistance to an O2-containing simulated flue gas feed. The new composition of DFM was then prepared with tablets for future industrial applications and scaled up to 10 grams suitable for testing in a fixed bed reactor. Parametric and 50-cycle aging studies were conducted in a newly constructed scaled-up fixed bed reactor using 10 grams of DFM tablets in the simulated flue gas atmosphere for CO2 capture. With the presence of O2 in CO2 feed gas for step 1, the Ru catalyst is oxidized but must be rapidly reduced in step 2 to the active metallic state. Parametric studies identified 15% H2 is required for stable operation with no apparent deactivation. The parametric plus 50-cycle aging studies demonstrated excellent stability of the second generation DFM. A kinetic study was also conducted for the methanation step using powdered DFM but prepared via the tablet method to minimize any mass transfer and diffusion influence on the methanation rate. An empirical rate law was developed with kinetic parameters calculated. The methanation rate of captured CO2 is highly dependent on H2 partial pressure (approaching a reaction order of 1) while essentially zero reaction order of CO2 coverage was determined. The kinetic study highlights the importance of H2 partial pressure on the methanation process. Characterizations were conducted on the ground fresh and aged (underwent parametric and aging studies) DFM tablets. BET surface area, H2 chemisorption, X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images and scanning transmission electron microscopeenergy dispersive spectroscopy (STEM-EDS) mapping were utilized to study the material changes between fresh and aged samples. From fresh to aged, similar BET surface area was measured, improved both Ru and \u201cNa2O\u201d dispersion, and decreased Ru cluster size was observed while no definitive proof of the nature of the sodium species was obtained via XRD. The second generation DFM containing 5% Ru, 6.1% \u201cNa2O\u201d / Al2O3 was shown to possess the capability of capturing CO2 from O2-containing simulated flue gas and subsequent methanation with addition of H2 produced from excess renewable energy (or from chemical processes) with twice the CO2 and CH4 capacity relative to the first generation DFM. Activity, selectivity and stability has been demonstrated for the second generation DFM. We envision swing reactors to be utilized commercially where the flue gas feed for step 1 and H2 for step 2 are throttled alternatively between each reactor for continuous operation.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "1a2b288522aca6a9fffc211864d68b7c688143e3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "229319071", "CorpusId": 107812715}, "title": "Interview with Jeffrey Long", "abstract": "J effrey L ong : C arbon C apture and S ustainability B S J Jennifer Cherone, Kapil Gururangan, Jared Rosen, Prashant Bhatt, Elaine Owen, Manisha Rai Professor Jeffrey Long graduated with his doctorate from Harvard University in 1995 and en- tered UC Berkeley as a National Science Foundation Postdoctoral Fellow from 1996 to 1997.

It\u2019s a very clean technology for driving around and so we thought our approach to making materials might be applicable to storing hydrogen at high capacity in cars. It\u2019s important for hydrogen cars because now, hydrogen is such a volatile molecule that cars struggle to travel long distances before you have to refill them.

This analysis revealed that from a carbon storage and emission perspective, it was better to consume BC\u2019s harvests within Canada and only export those products that would be used for long-lived construction applications, provided that construction market access beyond the US was available. However, restricting export of wood products destined for short-lived uses such as pulp and wood pellets would have significant economic and social impacts. On the other hand, inward-focused strategies had a small but politically and environmentally meaningful contribution to BC\u2019s climate action plan. This study also revealed the conflicts between a demand-driven bioeconomy and targeted environmental outcomes. A hierarchical incentive system that could co-exist with other market drivers may help achieve emission reduction goals, but this would require a better quantitative understanding of wood products\u2019 substitution effects. While the analyses were conducted for BC, other regions that are net exporters of wood products may face similar issues.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "f8d6ed66a7f635e0193dd8a9d67417693ac5f87d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "298760692", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1007747201521", "CorpusId": 43829207}, "title": "Lipid dynamics in anadromous Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus (L.): seasonal variations in lipid storage depots and lipid class composition", "abstract": "Changes in lipid class composition of tissues of anadromous Arctic charr, Salvelinus alpinus, were studied in relation to seasonal patterns of lipid deposition and lipid mobilisation. Charr of a north Norwegian population were collected in late May when fish were migrating towards the sea, and in mid-July when the fish re-entered fresh water. Some maturing fish captured in mid-July were held in captivity until late September to assess lipid dynamics associated with maturation. The carcass (head, fins, skeleton and skin) accounted for approx. 50% of the total body lipid content when the fish re-entered fresh water from the sea. Triacylglycerols (TAG) comprised 75-80% of the carcass lipid in ascending charr, confirming that the carcass is a major lipid depot. The skeletal muscle also represented a major lipid store: muscle of ascending charr contained 35-40% of the body lipids, with TAG being dominant (approx. 75% of muscle lipid). The gut (gastrointestinal tract and visceral lipid) and liver of ascending charr each held only 4-5%; of the body lipid, TAG being the dominant lipid class in both of these depots (Gut TAG: 60-65%; Liver TAG: 50-55%). Body lipid decreased 30-40% during maturation: lipids were depleted from all depots, but mobilisation of from the carcass and muscle was quantitatively the most important. In mature females, the ovaries held almost 25% of the body lipid, with the proportion of TAG exceeding that of polar lipids (PL)(TAG: 62%; PL 12.4%). In the mature males, the testes accounted for less than 3% of the total lipids. TAG tended to dominate the testis lipids (TAG: 29.5%), but there were also quite high proportions of free fatty acids, cholesterol and polar lipids (FFA: 23.5%; C: 15%; PL 9.7%). Females lost approx. 80% of their body lipid during spawning and overwintering, the majority of this being TAG. Males also lost large amounts of TAG during the winter, but in contrast to the females lipid depletion amounted to only 50-55% of that present at the time of ascent into fresh water.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "6d25e74e6eb9436b8bfad06c2d14a2ba522087dd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "361129634", "CorpusId": 152420009}, "title": "An overview of international and national law issues arising from the development of Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) in South Africa", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "2e102a450e3a0239c596612c598330dd57229595", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1081/22020586.2010.12042047", "CorpusId": 132416968}, "title": "The Energy Portfolio Downunder: What\u2019s new and enabling?", "abstract": "Australia\u2019s subsurface holds a huge energy resource endowment including coal, petroleum, uranium, and geothermal energy.

A UK North Sea case study anticipates the operation of two injection sites in the Captain Sandstone and assesses any interaction between the injection sites.

An injection scenario was examined that comprised an initial project storing within a depleted hydrocarbon field structure followed by a second injection site within the surrounding saline aquifer. The research investigations were targeted to identify and reduce any perceived concerns specific to the operation of two sites by a risk assessment-led process.

One of the substantial emission sectors in Australia is agriculture and the Australian Government is pursuing policies to incentivise emission reductions by farmers. These incentives are driven by the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI), which is a national programme that financially compensates farmers who take measures to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions or increase carbon storage in soils and vegetation. Next to mitigating greenhouse gas concentrations, carbon farming practices can be accompanied by so-called \u2018co-benefits\u2019 such as positive effects on biodiversity, increasing the value of landscape aesthetics and the reduction of soil erosion. These co-benefits will generate social and environmental values that are not only experienced by farmers but also by other citizens. A better understanding of the values that the public attaches to these co-benefits can play an important role to support farmers in their carbon farming practices. This is because if projects deliver more benefits next to carbon mitigation, buyers might be willing pay a higher price for the carbon credits. In this study, we measure the public\u2019s willingness to pay (WTP) for the co-benefits of carbon farming. A choice experiment was conducted among Australian citizens that included three environmental attributes: carbon emission reductions, increase in native vegetation and a reduction in soil erosion. The results of multi-nominal logit models and mixed logit models show that Australians are likely to receive welfare benefits from carbon mitigation activities that also provide biodiversity benefits. This means that carbon farming policies could potentially be broadened to capture co-benefits and not be restricted to solely carbon sequestration.

Inconsistent or unreliable information capture, especially for infrequent events, compromises attempts to analyze events in quantitative terms, understand their implications, and assess corrective efforts. To enhance reporting, we developed a secure, electronic, mandatory system for reporting quality assurance data linked to our electronic anesthesia record. METHODS: We used the capabilities of our anesthesia information management system (AIMS) in conjunction with internally developed, secure, intranet-based, Web application software. The application is implemented with a backend allowing robust data storage, retrieval, data analysis, and reporting capabilities. We customized a feature within the AIMS software to create a hard stop in the documentation workflow before the end of anesthesia care time stamp for every case. The software forces the anesthesia provider to access the separate quality assurance data collection program, which provides a checklist for targeted clinical events and a free text option. After completing the event collection program, the software automatically returns the clinician to the AIMS to finalize the anesthesia record. RESULTS: The number of events captured by the departmental quality assurance office increased by 92% (95% confidence interval [CI] 60.4%\u2013130%) after system implementation. The major contributor to this increase was the new electronic system. This increase has been sustained over the initial 12 full months after implementation. Under our reporting criteria, the overall rate of clinical events reported by any method was 471 events out of 55,382 cases or 0.85% (95% CI 0.78% to 0.93%). The new system collected 67% of these events (95% confidence interval 63%\u201371%). CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the implementation in an academic anesthesia department of a secure clinical event reporting system linked to an AIMS. The system enforces entry of quality assurance information (either no clinical event or notification of a clinical event).

This technology requires robust risk assessment and management from the early stages of the project (i.e. during the site selection phase, prior to injection), which is a challenging task due to the high level of aleatory and epistemic uncertainties. This paper aims at implementing and comparing two frameworks for dealing with uncertainties: a classical probabilistic framework and a probabilistic-fuzzy-based (i.e. jointly combining fuzzy sets and probabilities) one. The comparison of both frameworks is illustrated for assessing the risk related to leakage of brine through an abandoned well on a realistic site in the Paris basin (France). For brine leakage flow computation, a semi-analytical model, requiring 25 input parameters, is used. Depending on the framework, available data is represented in a different manner (either using classical probability laws or interval-valued tools). Though the fuzzy-probabilistic framework for uncertainty propagation is computationally more expensive, it presents the major advantage to highlight situations of high degree of epistemic uncertainty: this enables nuancing a too-optimistic decision-making only supported by a single probabilistic curve (i.e. using the Monte-Carlo results). On this basis, we demonstrate how fuzzy-based sensitivity analysis can help identifying how to reduce the imprecision in an effective way, which has useful applications for additional studies.

Trehalose synthesis and accumulation from lactate was clearly identified as the source for glucose efflux after cell harvest and resuspension. Cultivations of strains with active pyruvate kinase successfully identified lactate as the carbon source causing intracellular trehalose storage. The usage of glycerol as sole carbon source during the whole process enabled an improved process performance and inhibited trehalose accumulation.

A first step to understanding the sequestration potential is to quantify the biomass C and soil C storage. In the Fraser Valley of British Columbia, Canada, a hedgerow stewardship program incentivizes farmers to plant hedgerows to create habitat for biodiversity conservation and to improve ecosystem services such as climate change mitigation. This study evaluated the efficacy of hedgerows to store C in woody biomass and soil relative to remnant hedgerows (RH) and neighboring production fields with annual crops. We measured soil C (equivalent soil mass) and soil aggregate stability in both hedgerows and production fields, while biomass C and species diversity were calculated for the trees and shrubs in the two hedgerow types. There was no significant difference in the biomass C in the two hedgerow types, despite age differences with planted hedgerows (PH) having a mean total above- and belowground biomass of 76 \u00b1 32 t C ha\u22121 (33.8 \u00b1 14.2 tn C ac\u22121) and RH 124 \u00b1 21 t C ha\u22121 (55.3 \u00b1 9.3 tn C ac\u22121).

Fuel components like methanol, ethanol, propanols, and butanols represent promising candidates to enable the targets for transportation to be achieved because they can be used with existing infrastructure and can be further processed to give additives and substitutes. A wide variety of feedstocks and processes are available for this purpose. In this review, the thermocatalytic and biological synthesis routes for C1\u2013C4 alcohol fuels are summarized to illustrate the many alternatives. They include biomass and waste gasification and carbon capture and utilization to obtain syngas for catalytic conversion, fermentation of sugars from lignocellulosic feedstock, and novel, less developed pathways like syngas fermentation, glycerol conversion, and biogas reforming. The current state of technology is presented by discussing the advantages and technical hurdles, and by introducing recent scaled\u2010up approaches. This demonstrates the need for further research and development. The assessment of techno\u2010economic analyses in the literature illustrates the dominant factors affecting production costs and reveals the broad range of feasibility of the various production routes. The review shows that the routes most similar to conventional, well\u2010established syntheses bear the highest potential to be implemented in the short and medium term. The availability of cheap and abundant feedstock also plays a crucial role. Methanol synthesis from biomass gasification and ethanol, and acetone\u2010butanol\u2010ethanol fermentation from lignocellulosic biomass, are therefore considered to be very promising. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.

Biomass is widely considered to be a renewable source of energy which is often available in large quantities and at a low cost as a by-product of agriculture and forestry. Its use is potentially CO2 neutral as the amount of CO2 released during combustion is equal to the amount removed from the atmosphere during photosynthesis (although emissions from fertiliser, transport, farming and pre-treatment usually result in its use being slightly CO2 positive). Furthermore, biomass utilisation coupled with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) can result in negative CO2 emissions i.e. a net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.

This source-to-sink carbon allocation occurs in the phloem and requires the loading of sucrose into the leaf phloem and, at the sink end, its import into the growing embryo. Both tasks are achieved through the function of SUT sucrose transporters. In this study, we used vegetable peas (Pisum sativum L.), harvested for human consumption as immature seeds, as our model crop and simultaneously overexpressed the endogenous SUT1 transporter in the leaf phloem and in cotyledon epidermis cells where import into the embryo occurs. Using this 'Push-and-Pull' approach, the transgenic SUT1 plants displayed increased sucrose phloem loading and carbon movement from source to sink causing higher sucrose levels in developing pea seeds. The enhanced sucrose partitioning further led to improved photosynthesis rates, increased leaf nitrogen assimilation, and enhanced source-to-sink transport of amino acids. Embryo loading with amino acids was also increased in SUT1-overexpressors resulting in higher protein levels in immature seeds. Further, transgenic plants grown until desiccation produced more seed protein and starch, as well as higher seed yields than the wild-type plants. Together, the results demonstrate that the SUT1-overexpressing plants with enhanced sucrose allocation to sinks adjust leaf carbon and nitrogen metabolism, and amino acid partitioning in order to accommodate the increased assimilate demand of growing seeds. We further provide evidence that the combined Push-and-Pull approach for enhancing carbon transport is a successful strategy for improving seed yields and nutritional quality in legumes.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "988ec456a4bd90c31031d798a5b46baf55adcabd", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 59187219}, "title": "Transient Flow Modelling of Start-up CO 2 Injection into Highly-depleted Oil / Gas Fields Revelation", "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) represent a promising technology in mitigating global warming challenges.

This can strongly affect the climate, causing the Earth\u2019s surface to warm up, the so called \u2018amplified greenhouse effect\u2019. To alleviate these environmental concerns regarding the current CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) is investigated as one of the possible routes. Due to the acidic character of CO2, basic oxides are expected to be suitable sorbents. Hydrotalcite, a natural clay, is specifically suitable for pre-combustion capture (250- 400 C), due to its acceptable sorption capacity and facile regeneration. The influence of lateral platelet size (~40 nm- 2 ?m), the use of a support (carbon nanofibers, CNF) and addition of a promoter (alkali carbonate: K2CO3/Na2CO3) on the CO2 capture properties of HT was investigated. There was no significant difference in the CO2 sorption capacities at 523 K fsor all unsupported HTs, regardless the platelet size of the HT precursor (~0.1 mmol.g-1). The use of activated, promoted (alkali carbonate) hydrotalcites showed a much higher capacity (~0.3 mmol.g-1) at 523 K. In addition, the capacities of the activated supported HT at 523 K were significantly increased compared to the activated unsupported HT (1.3- 2.5 mmol.g-1HT). The alkali-loaded supported HTs showed capacities slightly higher than the capacity of supported unpromoted HT. The increase in capacity for the promoted and/or supported HTs points to a higher concentration of defects (low-coordination of oxygen sites) on the surface of the activated (alkali-)loaded HTs compared to the unloaded and unsupported HT. The higher concentration of adsorption for the promoted (supported) HTs, might be caused by the presence of Na+/K+ on the surface of Mg(Al)Ox. Due to the larger size of these alkali ions, incorporation in an activated HT would therefore be difficult and it is proposed that the K+/Na+ are located at the surface and not in the \u2018bulk\u2019 of the MgAlOx. The tentative mechanism is that K+ substitutes an Mg2+ and additional oxygen vacancies at the surface are created. Finally, a new developed sorbent, i.e. potassium carbonate (K2CO3) deposited on carbon nanofibers for CO2 capture at low temperatures (373 K, post-combustion capture), was compared with potassium carbonate deposited on activated coal (AC) and alumina (Al2O3). K2CO3 loaded on the CNF support revealed excellent properties as CO2 sorbent compared to the K2CO3-AC and K2CO3-Al2O3 sorbents, having the highest capacity and fast desorption kinetics at low desorption temperatures (423- 523 K). These favorable properties of K2CO3-CNF are considered to originate from relatively small K2CO3 particles combined with a good accessibility of these particles surrounded by the CNF. Moreover, the K2CO3-CNF could be regenerated with a low energy input estimated at 2- 3 MJ/ton CO2, far below the energy needed for the currently used amine-scrubbers, which shows this sorbent's potential to become competitive with established post-combustion sorbents.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "3032253c92b82659351ab4da91da18ca51c7545a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2907271410", "DOI": "10.24321/2455.3093.201806", "CorpusId": 134387838}, "title": "A Review of Biochar Based Technologies in Carbon Capture and Sequestration", "abstract": "The emission of greenhouse gases, predominantly, carbon dioxide, due to burning, decomposition and various other ways to dispose of agricultural crop residues or biomass waste has led to an increased persistence of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

Feedstock such as manure generated by poultry and livestock operations, agricultural waste and biodegradable solid waste can be used for the production of biochar. Biochar can be used as a soil amendment for poor soils, carrier for plant nutrients, water filtering medium, insulation in the building industry and as carbon sinks due to its porosity, stability and high surface area.

Exhaust gasses from the Otto cycle, rich in CO2 and at high temperature, are recycled to the gasifier to enhance syngas production.

In both cases, a significant reduction in neutrophil extravasation was observed. Subsequent in vitro static experiments showed that CORM-3 produced a direct effect on neutrophil (polymorphonuclear neutrophil; PMN) adhesion molecule expression; dose-dependently inhibiting platelet-activating factor stimulated CD11b up-regulation and L-selectin shedding, whereas no effect was observed on up-regulation of human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule-1 or E-selectin nor on interleukin-8 chemokine production. In addition, when PMN interaction with HUVECs was studied, an inhibitory effect of CORM-3 on cell capture and rolling was observed. The effect of CORM-3 on PMN CD11b expression was mimicked by the incubation of PMN with the selective large potassium channel opener 1,3-dihydro-1-(2-hydroxy-5-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-benzimidazol-2-one (NS-1619), which suggests that CORM-3 actions in this instance are mediated, at least in part, via opening of this channel.

Such kind of leakages is not currently considered in any regulatory framework or greenhouse gas emission inventory. In the North Sea and in other hydrocarbon-prolific areas of the world shallow gas pockets are frequently observed in the sedimentary overburden above the deep hydrocarbon reservoirs and aggregate emissions along numerous wells may be significant. This conclusion also has important implications for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) since it implies that leakage from a carbon dioxide (CO2) storage site can potentially occur along any type of well (production, exploration, or abandoned), as long as it penetrates the subsurface CO2 plume. The second part of this thesis focuses on the Sleipner CO2 storage site in the Central North Sea and investigates hypothetic, but probably realistic leakage of CO2 along a well that penetrates the subsurface CO2 plume and leaks into the ~80 m deep water column, using a combination of experimental field data and numerical modelling. Small footprints of CO2 leakage in seawater imply that the environmental consequences of a single well leaking CO2 are insignificant and finding those leaks may pose challenging. Considering the millions of oil and gas wells drilled world-wide and the prospective implementation of CCS at a scale that would have significant impact on global CO2 emissions, this thesis stresses that pressure-based testing of well integrity is not sufficient for identifying and quantifying gas emissions (CH4 or CO2) along hydrocarbon wells.
