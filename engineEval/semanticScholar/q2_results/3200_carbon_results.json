The Svartsengi geothermal power plant operations have pioneered the simultaneous production of electricity and hot water from a geothermal reservoir. The Blue Lagoon is a warm geothermal pool using brine from the power plant. This paper reports on the processes and procedures at the Blue Lagoon and the Svartsengi power station, aimed at increasing sustainability of the geothermal resource by injecting the geothermal brine back to ground, to ensure the geothermal resource sustainability in the area. This paper also discusses and explains in details the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from geothermal plant operations in Iceland. When the steam from a geothermal reservoir emerges from the ground, it comes up with enough energy to drive turbine generators for electricity production. However, this involves releasing several greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, including hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2). This research spotlights a geothermal power plant in Hellishei\u00f0i, Iceland, and the use of the CarbFix procedure of capturing and storing carbon dioxide, reducing CO2 emissions from the harnessing of geothermal resources for electricity. CarbFix is a carbon capture and storage (CCS) or carbon mineralization procedure aimed at binding CO2 to rock. This procedure has been used at Hellishei\u00f0i power plant for the past decade in Iceland. Scientists have also developed the SulFix procedure, to capture sulphate H2S in ground. These procedures, SulFix and CarbFix, reduce outlet of greenhouse gases by storing them in basalt rock \u2013 also referred to as mineral carbonation or carbon capture and storage. This involves dissolving the greenhouse gases in water, and re-injecting them back into the ground through boreholes, in Hellishei\u00f0i. This current research also shows the geology in these areas and reports on calculations that have found re-injection of greenhouse gasses to ground to be economically feasible. The paper covers several scenarios that have already been tested to determine the financial feasibility of capture and storage. These have involved calculating the estimated internal rate of return (IRR), the return on investment (ROI) and the present value (NPV).

Post-combustion process reference is based on the absorption/desorption process with a solution of monoethanolamine (MEA) 30wt% in water. However, this benchmark molecule has some drawbacks and especially the high regeneration energy which is around 4 GJ/ton CO2. For this reason, there is a need to innovate and optimize solvents for CO2 capture in order to minimize the regeneration energy and to improve the solvent capture efficiency. The choice of the promising molecules depends on many physical and chemical characteristics (like absorption capacity, kinetics reaction between amine, reaction enthalpy and solvent stability and toxicity). This work focuses on the absorption capacity and the reaction rates of single and blended amines. Five commercially available amines with 30wt% and 50wt% concentrations in water (monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), 2-amino-2-methylpropanol (AMP) and piperazine (PZ)) were screened experimentally based on equilibrium CO2 absorption capacity and CO2 absorption rate data; the results show that experimental data for single amines are in good agreement with literature values. From the solvent combinations, four piperazine-based blends show strong indication of better performance than 30wt% MEA reference.

Since its discovery, CNT has been intensively studied due to its remarkable electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties (Iijima, 1991; Katz & Willner, 2004). Based on the structures and dimensions, CNTs can be divided into two groups: single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). An SWNT is one tube of graphene capped at both ends and it consists of only surface carbon atoms; its diameter is in the range of 1-2 nm. An MWNT is composed of multiple coaxial tubes of SWNTs and its diameter is often in the range of 10-150 nm. CNTs have a high potential in a broad range of applications, especially in nanoelectronics and biomedical sensors. A wide variety of electronic devices based on individual CNTs or CNT thin films have been developed and used as sensors (Boul et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Xue & Cui, 2008b), field-effect transistors (Xue & Cui, 2009; Xue et al., 2006), conductive interconnects (Robertson et al., 2008; Xue & Cui, 2008a), and energy storage systems (Hu et al., 2009; Kaempgen et al., 2009). A critical step to obtain these practical devices is to deposit well-organized and highly aligned CNTs in desired locations. Recently, researchers have developed a number of methods to align CNTs: using moving fluids to organize nanotubes (S. Li et al., 2007), introducing gas flows in reactors or channels (Liu et al., 2009), withdrawing microfluidic channels from solutions (Tsukruk et al., 2004), spin coating nanotube dispersions with controlled speeds (LeMieux et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2009), and magnetic capturing of nanotubes (Shim et al., 2009). However, many of these techniques have limitations and restrictions because they require either intensive preparation processes or assisting materials with special properties. Therefore, their applications are relatively limited. By comparison, dielectrophoresis, a simple but versatile method, has proven to be effective in aligning CNTs in small and large scales (Gultepe et al., 2008; Mureau et al., 2006). This method can be conducted at room temperature with low voltages. In addition, a number of parameters such as solution concentration, deposition time, alternating current (AC) amplitude, and frequency can be adjusted to optimize the quality of the aligned CNTs. More importantly, dielectrophoresis can be easily incorporated into device fabrication and has the potential to be used in wafer-level deposition for the mass production of CNT-based devices (Monica et al., 2008; Stokes & Khondaker, 2008; Xiao & Camino, 2009).", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "735f8cd79b0544ccc2e089923d274420d1f00dc9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2986023436", "DOI": "10.1016/j.ijggc.2019.102859", "CorpusId": 209711320}, "title": "Investigating the competitiveness of Carbon Capture and Storage in Italian power plants under different investment scenarios", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "3ea255a482689e76bc300308114c847ba507902c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1624256413", "CorpusId": 41530625}, "title": "Gas-liquid flow on smooth and textured inclined planes", "abstract": "Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) is one of the various methods that can be used to reduce the carbon footprint of the energy sector.

Compared to the other NPs, TiO2 nanofluids exhibit superior stability due to their high zeta potential. In previous studies, TiO2 nanofluids have shown superior performance in heat transfer and cooling applications along with importing the stability of other nanofluids like SiO2 in form of nanocomposites. Therefore, in this study, a nanofluid formulation consisting of titania nanofluid in a base solution of ethylene glycol (EG) with different co-stabilizers such as surfactants was synthesized for better dispersion stability, enhanced electrical, and rheological properties especially for the use in high-temperature industrial applications which include carbon capture and storage along with enhanced oil recovery. The formulated nanofluid was investigated for stability using dynamic light scattering (DLS) study and electrical conductivity. Additionally, the formulated nanofluid was also examined for thermal stability at high temperatures using an electrical conductivity study followed by rheological measurements at 30 and 90 \u00b0C. At a high temperature, the shear-thinning behavior of EG was found highly affected by shear rate; however, this deformation was controlled using TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). Furthermore, the role of surfactant was also investigated on dispersion stability, electrical conductivity followed by viscosity results, and it was found that the nanofluid is superior in presence of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as compared to nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 (TX-100). The inclusion of ionic surfactant provides a charged layer of micelles surrounding the core of a NP and it produced additional surface potential. Consequently, it increases the repulsive force between two adjacent NPs and renders a greater stability to nanofluid while nonionic surfactant allowed monomers to adsorb on the surface of NP via hydrophobic interaction and enhances the short-range interparticle repulsion, to stabilize nanofluid. This makes titania nanofluid suitable for widespread high-temperature applications where conventional nanofluids face limitations. Finally, the application of the synthesized titania nanofluids was explored for the capture and transport of CO2 where the inclusion of the anionic surfactant was found to increase the CO2 capturing ability of titania nanofluids by 140\u2013220% (over the conventional nanofluid) while also showing superior retention at both investigated temperatures.

This paper discusses key greenhouse gas accounting issues to be addressed before carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture and storage (CCS) activities can be included in the portfolio of climate change mitigation activities. Guidance and policies on baselines and the accounting of emission reductions will be critical to ensure that CCS projects can benefit from CO 2 markets and are recognised under various mitigation schemes. 2. Carbon dioxide capture and storage offers important possibilities for making further use of fossil fuels more compatible with climate change mitigation policies. The largest volumes of CO 2 could be captured from large point sources such as from power generation, which alone accounts for about 40 per cent of total anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. The development of capture technologies in the power generation sector could be particularly important in view of the projected increase in demand for electricity in fast developing countries with enormous coal reserves (IEA 2002a). Although, this prospect is promising, more research is needed to overcome several hurdles such as important costs of capture technology and the match of large capture sources with adequate geological storage sites. 3. CO 2 capture and storage technologies have the potential to become an important climate change mitigation option.

Despite this ambition, no mechanism allows for the inclusion of CO2 removal credits (CRCs) in the EU ETS to date. Amending the EU ETS legislation is required to create enabling conditions for a net negative cap. Here, we conceptually discuss various economic, legal, and political challenges surrounding the integration of CRCs into the EU ETS. To analyze cap-and-trade systems encompassing negative emissions, we introduce the effective (elastic) cap resulting from the integration of CRCs in addition to the regulatory (inelastic) cap, the latter now being binding for the net emissions only. Given current cost estimates for BECCS and DACCS, minimum quantities for the use of removals, as opposed to ceilings as currently discussed, would be required to promote the near-term integration of such technologies. Instead of direct interaction between the companies involved in emissions trading and the providers of CRCs, the regulatory authority could also transitionally act as an intermediary by buying CRCs and supplying them in turn conditional upon observed allowances prices, for example, by supporting a (soft) price collar. Contrary to a price collar without dedicated support from CRCs, in this case (net) compliance with the overall cap is maintained. EU legislation already provides safeguards for physical carbon leakage concerning CCS, making Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and Direct Air Capture and Storage prioritized for inclusion in the EU ETS. Furthermore, a special opportunity might apply for the inclusion of BECCS installations. Repealing the provision that installations exclusively using biomass are not covered by the ETS Directive, combined with freely allocated allowances to these installations, would allow operators of biomass installations to sell allowances made available through the use of BECCS. Achieving GHG neutrality in the EU by 2050 requires designing suitable incentive systems for CO2 removal, which includes the option to open up EU emissions trading to CRCs.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "6c0ac6e2e3e7ff5ae526e6d27b8579da2efac6d6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3003261843", "DOI": "10.1155/2020/8509834", "CorpusId": 212615134}, "title": "Carbon Tax and Trading Price on Power Plant with Carbon Capture and Storage under Incentive Regulation Theory", "abstract": "This paper investigates how the government can develop subsidies or tax policies to incent power plants to effectively carry out carbon capture to reduce carbon emissions.

Parties are pursuing various strategies to reduce CO2 emissions. Renewable energy, energy efficiency, cleaner fuels, terrestrial CO2 sequestration, and geologic CO2 capture and storage (CCS) are the major efforts underway. This thesis examines some major regulatory and political issues that may affect geologic sequestration projects in the future. CCS is a technology system that captures CO2 from a point source (e.g. power plant or industrial facility), pressurizes it into liquid form, transports it, and finally injects it underground into a porous geology for long-term storage. Technical and economic issues of capture, transportation, and injection of CO2 have been relatively well studied over the past decade. The impacts of how current environmental regulation and political action to curb climate change will affect CCS have not been thoroughly explored. This thesis investigates the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Underground Injection Control Program and several types of protected and restricted land use areas to evaluate where it would be difficult or impossible to site a CCS project. I also explore state-level action on climate change and categorize them based on their attractiveness for CCS projects. I suggest a methodology for incorporating this regulatory information into a geographic information system based decision analysis tool, designed to aid decision makers dealing with CCS.

The primary carbon dioxide (CO2) storage site candidates that are targeting funds are the saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas fields in the North Sea. At the time of writing, no outright winners have been announced. These programs are open to CCS projects as well as carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) projects. The former deals exclusively with greenhouse gas storage, but the latter differs by using the injected CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) before eventually being stored. Hence, there are considerable technical and commercial differences between CCS and CCUS projects, in much the same way as onshore projects face less challenges and constraints than if they were being implemented offshore. The evaluation and selection of which offshore carbon storage projects should be funded is a tough exercise to undertake, but it becomes much more difficult if the competing projects under consideration are allowed to be CCS or CCUS, full chain or part chain, or a mixture of all of the aforementioned. Bias may arise via reliance on selection criterion such as volume of stored CO2 per unit of expenditure, which is likely to favor saline aquifer storage projects over other types, no matter how innovative or compelling they are. The authors believe that selection committees in Brussels and London would greatly simplify their decision of which bid should be funded, and in what proportion, by separating competing projects into straightforward storage types and CO2-EOR types. Offshore experience of either project type is scarce and their relative merits are difficult to reconcile as the subsurface understanding, timeframe, economics, performance and goals of each project type are quite different. The paper recognizes that CCS-type projects can be further subdivided into saline aquifers, with open and closed systems, and abandoned gas fields, as each have different storage limitations. Also, CCUS-type projects, which realistically only include abandoned oil fields, can be further subdivided to reflect the operational and commercial characteristics of different EOR schemes. It is hoped that the discussion outlined in this paper will lead to easier and fairer screening criteria for offshore CCS and CCUS projects for use by governments, operators and investors alike.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "37036c4cc357b145930752c69e999a859e0b01e3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3006915148", "DOI": "10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2020.115119", "CorpusId": 213406499}, "title": "Tailored solar field and solvent storage for direct solvent regeneration: A novel approach to solarise carbon capture technology", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "7777729e200b931e437176cc073a85f4bda31c53", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2129261856", "CorpusId": 145346654}, "title": "Shifting streams : on the health, safety and environmental impacts of carbon dioxide capture, transport and storage", "abstract": "Greenhouse gas emissions are expected to result in global climate change with potentially severe consequences for ecosystems and mankind.

The figure illustrates some of the major concepts associated with geologic carbon sequestration. The figure is not to scale. Earth\u2019s carbon cycle is the movement of carbon through the planet\u2019s atmospheric, biologic, geologic, and hydrologic systems (Sundquist and others, 2008). As illustrated in the figure, many activities of modern human life have altered the carbon cycle by increasing the amount of CO2 produced. For example, power generating facilities, petrochemical plants, cement production plants, cars and trucks, industrial processes, and agricultural practices all produce CO2 and release it into the environment. Some of this CO2 is sequestered naturally in oceans, plants, and soils, but an increasing amount is making its way into the atmosphere. Additional forms of carbon sequestration are desirable to offset these increasing emissions. Carbon dioxide can be captured from stationary sources, such as powerplants and other large industrial facilities, compressed to a fluid state, and injected deep underground into permeable and porous geologic strata in which it will remain isolated for long periods of time. This process reduces or eliminates the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. The geologic formation in which the gas is stored must be overlain by another layer of impermeable rock to seal in the injected CO2. In the figure, injection wells are depicted as columns of brown \u201cbubbles\u201d with arrows pointed downward into the earth. Brown bubbles in the storage formation represent geologic storage of CO2. The technology for sequestering CO2 is still being developed, although a few industrial-sized carbon sequestration projects are operating worldwide. Several are associated with offshore natural gas production, as depicted by the offshore platform at the far right of the figure. In addition, for many decades CO2 has been injected into geologic formations to boost production from oilfields by displacing trapped oil and gas. This process, known as enhanced oil recovery, has not been optimized for storage of CO2, although significant experience has been gained in handling carbon dioxide, including how to ship it through pipelines, how to prevent leakage by plugging abandoned wells, and how to construct injection wells and inject CO2 into them. Determining the amount of CO2 that can be sequestered nationally is important so that long-term plans can be made to capture and store CO2. Toward this end, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) has developed a method for assessing the amount of CO2 that might be sequestered in geologic formations (Brennan and others, 2010). As illustrated in the figure, the method developed by the USGS considers two main types of trapping to determine the technically accessible storage resource\u2014that is, the amount of CO2 that can be stored using current technology. One type, known as buoyant trapping, fills the pore space in the rock with CO2; the CO2 is held in place by seal formations on the top and sides of the porous rock. This type of trapping is somewhat analogous to how oil and gas are trapped and is illustrated in the figure by the accumulation of CO2 in arc-shaped structures (anticlines) that are overlain by low-permeability seal formations that prevent upward leakage. The other type of trapping, known as residual trapping, occurs as injected CO2 passes through the storage formation and leaves some CO2 behind; the CO2 is held in place by surface tension in pore spaces. This type of trapping retains less CO2 per given rock volume, but there is much more rock for which this type of trapping applies.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "5a55e2b6af5935b9c397a051a337c92be94f12fe", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3025639719", "DOI": "10.3390/en13102519", "CorpusId": 219438683}, "title": "Parametric Process Design and Economic Analysis of Post-Combustion CO2 Capture and Compression for Coal- and Natural Gas-Fired Power Plants", "abstract": "For the envisaged large number of commercial-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects that are to be implemented in the near future, a number of issues still need to be resolved, the most prominent being the large capital and operational costs incurred for the CO 2 capture and compression process.

By using a simple analytical dynamic optimization model, we examine the optimal paths of CCS use, CCS\u2019s real price inclusive of the shadow price, and their difference from the operational price. A particular implication of the model is that if all else is equal, the shadow price of CCS could make the technology relatively less attractive than renewable energy due to CCS\u2019s reliance on scarce reservoirs and the resultant shadow value.

With the aim of providing a better understanding of the impact of uncertainties on the design and cost of CCS chains, as well as the capture technology selection, the case of a hypothetical 40 MW waste-to-energy plant located in Norway is considered. The impact of key technical and cost uncertainties on the cost of different CO2 capture and CCS chain options are investigated using an in-house techno-economic CCS assessment tool combined with an uncertainty quantification framework. When the different capture options are compared on a deterministic basis, the advanced amine yields the best performances (CO2 avoidance cost of 153 \u20ac/tCO2, avoided), followed by the membrane process based on partial capture (200 \u20ac/tCO2, avoided) and MEA-based capture (217 \u20ac/tCO2, avoided). However, in contrast with the advanced amine, the partial capture considered in the membrane process does not enable net negative CO2 emissions. Once technical and cost uncertainties are taken into account, the advanced amine-based capture remains the best option, however the MEA-based capture outperform the membrane process. Finally, the stochastic optimization showed that the uncertainties considered do not impact the optimal capture capacity in this case. The full CCS chain perspective is then included through two chain options: a nearby offshore saline aquifer or an offshore CO2 EOR storage located further away. The EOR-based chain leads to the best performances (187 vs. 202 \u20ac/tCO2, avoided) both on a deterministic basis and when different uncertainty scenarios are considered. However, as a shared transport and storage infrastructure is considered, uncertainty regarding the amount of CO2 coming from nearby industries leads to a different optimal design of the chain (pipeline diameter and ship capacity). Finally, uncertainties on the EOR response to CO2 injection can significantly reduce the potential of the CO2 EOR-based chain and lead to cases in which the saline aquifer-based chain would be optimal.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "5874fec661055d505db2008bfa63d1c00dfd32f4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2120900730", "DOI": "10.2516/OGST/2014039", "CorpusId": 128488907}, "title": "Southern Adriatic Sea as a Potential Area for CO2 Geological Storage", "abstract": "The Southern Adriatic Sea is one of the five prospective areas for CO2 storage being evaluated under the three year (FP7) European SiteChar project dedicated to the characterization of European CO2 storage sites.

Yet, predicting vegetation dynamics often suffers from an inherent scale mismatch, with abundant data and process understanding being available at a fine spatial grain, but the relevance for decision\u2010making is increasing with spatial extent. We present a novel approach for scaling vegetation dynamics (SVD), using deep learning to predict vegetation transitions. Vegetation is discretized into a large number (103\u2013106) of potential states based on its structure, composition and functioning. Transition probabilities between states are estimated via a deep neural network (DNN) trained on observed or simulated vegetation transitions in combination with environmental variables. The impact of vegetation transitions on important ecological indicators is quantified by probabilistically linking attributes such as carbon storage and biodiversity to vegetation states. Here, we describe the SVD approach and present results of applying the framework in a meta\u2010modelling context. We trained a DNN using simulations of a process\u2010based forest landscape model for a complex mountain forest landscape under different climate scenarios. Subsequently, we evaluated the ability of SVD to project long\u2010term vegetation dynamics and the resulting changes in forest carbon storage and biodiversity. SVD captured spatial (e.g. elevational gradients) and temporal (e.g. species succession) patterns of vegetation dynamics well, and responded realistically to changing environmental conditions.

The CO emissions from two sub-sections of energy sector in Korea, such as thermal power plant and industry section(including manufacturing and construction industries), was about 300 million metric tons in 2004 and this is 53.3% of total GHG emissions in Korea.

The global atmospheric concentration of CO2 has increased from a pre-industrial value of approximately 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005. The warming of the climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of increasing global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice and rising global average sea level (IPCC, 2007a). To stabilize the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere, emissions need to peak and then decline thereafter. In the long term, energy conservation, efficiency improvements in energy conversion, lower carbon fuels such as natural gas and renewable energy sources are the most promising alternatives. For lower stabilization targets, scenarios put more emphasis on the use of low-carbon energy sources, such as renewable energy and nuclear power, and the use of CO2 capture and storage (CCS; Pacala & Socolow, 2004; IPCC, 2007b); however, the transition from the current dependence on fossil fuels would take many decades. The capture of CO2 from fossil fuel power plants and other large-scale stationary emission sources and storage in geologic formations is the only option that permits a transition from current high-intensity carbon-based energy sources to low-carbon energy sources. The safety of geologic storage of CO2 is obviously a central concern in planning carbon sequestration on a large scale. The current concept of geologic storage involves the injection of CO2 into deep formations, which typically contain brine. CO2 is supercritical at temperatures and pressures above the critical values of 304 K and 7.38 MPa. In typical geologic formations, the critical condition of CO2 is reached at a depth of approximately 740 m. Because of geologic pressure, the density of CO2 dramatically increases with depth; however, the density of CO2 is approximately 0.9 times that of water, so when CO2 is injected into the subsurface, buoyancy tends to bring CO2 upward in geologic formations. On the other hand, CO2 will be retained by physical and geochemical mechanisms, such as physical trapping (IPCC 2005), capillary trapping (Suekane et al. 2008, 2010a; Al Mansoori et al. 2010; Pentland et al. 2010; Zhou et al. 2010; Wildenschild et al. 2010; Saadatpoor 2010), solubility trapping (Lindeberg & Wessel-Berg 1997; McPherson & Cole 2000; Ennis-King et al. 2003; Gilfillan et al. 2009; Iding & Blunt 2010) and mineralization (Gunter et al. 1993).

In the base case, for comparison, the two reservoirs are operated independently, each as a multi-fluid (brine and carbon dioxide) reservoir that uses a number of horizontal, concentric injection and production well rings. When the shallow and the deep reservoirs are operated in an integrated fashion, in the shallow reservoir, power is produced only from the carbon dioxide (CO2), while the brine is geothermally preheated in the shallow multi-fluid reservoir, produced, and then reinjected at the deeper reservoir's brine injectors. The integrated reservoir scenarios are further subdivided into two cases: In one scenario, both brine (preheated in the shallow reservoir) and CO2 (from the surface) are injected separately into the deeper reservoir's appropriate injectors and both fluids are produced from their respective deep reservoir producers to generate electricity. In the other scenario, only preheated brine is injected into, and produced from, the deep reservoir for electric power generation. We find that integrated, vertically stacked, multi-fluid geothermal systems can result in improved system efficiency when power plant lifespans exceed ~30 years. In addition, preheating of brine before deep injection reduces brine overpressurization in the deep reservoir, reducing the risk of fluid-induced seismicity. Furthermore, CO2-Plume Geothermal (CPG) power plants in general, and the multi-fluid, multi-level geothermal system described here in particular, assign a value to CO2, which in turn may partially or fully offset the high costs of carbon capture at fossil-energy power plants and of CO2 injection, thereby facilitating economically feasible carbon capture and storage (CCS) operations that render fossil-energy power plants green. From a geothermal power plant perspective, the system results in a CO2 sequestering geothermal power plant with a negative carbon footprint. Finally, energy return on well costs and operational flexibility can be greater for integrated geothermal reservoirs, providing additional options for bulk and thermal energy storage, compared to equivalent, but separately operated reservoirs. System economics can be enhanced by revenues related to efficient delivery of large-scale bulk energy storage and ancillary services products (frequency regulation, load following, and spinning reserve), which are essential for electric grid integration of intermittently available renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar.

In the past, construction of large facilities such as nuclear power plants has been prevented or delayed by public opposition, and CCS proponents would like to know whether it will provoke similar public opposition. Since the Geologic Storage (GS) component of the CCS architecture has not been widely deployed, this thesis explores the characteristics of GS and how they might affect public perception and acceptance of the larger CCS architecture. To provide insight regarding public acceptance of CCS, this thesis addresses two questions; first asking how GS is likely to be perceived by the public and what can be done to improve that perception, and second asking whether financial compensation can be used to improve public acceptance of energy facilities. To address the first question about the public perception of GS, this thesis begins with a discussion of risk concepts and how it is used differently by experts, who use a realist perspective, and the general public, who use a social constructivist perspective. After discussing how this difference in perspective leads to risk disputes, this thesis presents an overview of the risk elements of GS. It then reviews existing risk assessments of GS and qualitatively evaluates the risks of GS in terms of their likelihood, impact, and uncertainty. The discussion on risk assessment perspectives and methods is then integrated with the GS risk review to forecast whether GS is likely to be accepted by the public. By using a public perspective to compare GS to existing energy technologies, this thesis concludes that the risks of GS are likely to eventually be considered no worse than existing fossil fuel energy technologies. However, since GS is a new technology with little public awareness, additional demonstrations and field tests will be necessary to make this case to the public. To address the question of whether financial compensation can be used to improve public acceptance of energy facilities, this thesis presents analyses of data from a public opinion poll on compensation and facility siting. Survey respondents were asked whether they would accept the construction of a natural gas pipeline, nuclear power plant, or coal fired power plant near their home if they were given annual payments of $100. The compensation offers had little net effect on the public\u2019s willingness to accept the facilities, and the survey results do not support the use of compensation to improve public acceptance of energy facilities.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "07d7f26499c0732a68861cccce1772ba2542afc6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3131404273", "DOI": "10.1039/D0GC04040A", "CorpusId": 234338824}, "title": "Photochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to formic acid", "abstract": "With the growing awareness of green chemistry, carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has received tremendous attention compared to carbon capture and storage (CCS).

The aspects of CO/sub 2/ control are discussed as well as the available CO/sub 2/ control points (CO/sub 2/ removal sites). The primary factor affecting the practicability of a CO/sub 2/ control system is the energy required by the control system. Of the three potential CO/sub 2/ control points, removal from the stacks of fossil fuel power plants appears to require the least amount of energy. Estimates of the energy required to capture and recover CO/sub 2/ from coal-fired power plant stacks by various processes are presented. Although capture and recovery of CO/sub 2/ is an important consideration in the overall scheme of CO/sub 2/ control, disposal or reuse of recovered CO/sub 2/ may be the weakest link in the CO/sub 2/ control chain. Of the several options considered, deep ocean storage appears to be the most promising. Two control scenarios are evaluated, one based on the absorption of CO/sub 2/ contained in power plant flue gas by seawater; the other, based on absorption of CO/sup 2/ by monoethanolamine (MEA). Capturedmore\u00a0\u00bb CO/sub 2/ is injected into the deep ocean in both cases. Analyses indicate that capture and disposal by seawater is not feasible, whereas capture and disposal using MEA is a possibility. However, the economic penalties of CO/sub 2/ control are significant; for example, at a CO/sub 2/ removal efficiency of 50%, it is estimated that the power generation efficiency of a conventional coal fired power plant would be reduced from 34 to about 25%. The cost of power generation would be expected to double.

This study proposes an integrated framework for analyzing the mechanism of CO2 emission reduction via GEI implementation. The obtained results demonstrate that the total cumulative contribution of GEI to mitigating the effects of CO2 emissions (estimated by conducting a scenario analysis) corresponds to a total reduction of 3100 Gt CO2. The contributions of the clean replacement, electricity replacement, and carbon capture and storage GEI components to this process are equal to 55, 42, 5%, respectively. Using GEI, the utilization of clean energy in 2050 will increase by a factor of 4.5 at an annual growth rate of 4.4%, and the electrification rate will be 2.4 times greater than the current one.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "ad348b3326bc4ae2605c184033ad0f4baaf86ef9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3089672623", "DOI": "10.3389/fenrg.2020.00190", "CorpusId": 222004207}, "title": "Optimizing the Design of Supply Chains for Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Sequestration in Europe: A Preliminary Assessment", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage represents a key technology for reducing the anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.

This contribution proposes an optimization framework for the design of carbon capture, transport, utilization, and storage supply chains in the European context. Based on literature data, technologies converting CO2 into methanol and polyether carbonate polyols were selected as the most promising and incorporated into the optimization framework. The goal is to reduce 50% of European emissions from large stationary sources by 2030. Results highlight that, under our assumptions, the significance of carbon utilization in terms of a reduction of the environmental impact is likely to be a minor one: considering the current state of technologies only about 2.4% of the overall CO2 emitted from large stationary sources can be removed by chemical utilization. However, significant benefits can be obtained in terms of overall cost reduction thanks to revenues deriving from the chemicals being produced.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "ddc07781c279d7aea82b9d8300ec6a9b06a0d0fb", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 211838289}, "title": "On the sustainability of CO2 storage through CO2 \u2013 Enhanced oil recovery", "abstract": "This work uses pilot examples of CO2 enhanced oil recovery to analyze whether and under which circumstances it is exergetically favorable to sequester CO2 through enhanced oil recovery. We find that the net storage efficiency (ratio between the stored and captured CO2) of the carbon capture and storage (CCS)-only projects is maximally 6\u201356% depending on the fuel used in the power plants. With the current state of technology, the CCS process will re-emit a minimum of 0.43\u20130.94 kg of CO2 per kg of CO2 stored. From thermodynamics point of view, CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) with CCS option is not sustainable, i.e., during the life cycle of the process more energy is consumed than the energy produced from oil. For the CCS to be efficient in reducing CO2 levels (1) the exergetic cost of CO2 separation from flue gas should be reduced, and/or (2) the capture process should not lead to additional carbon emission. Furthermore, we find that the exergy recovery factor of CO2-EOR depends on the CO2 utilization factor, which is currently in the low range of 2\u20134 bbl/tCO2 based on the field data. Exergetically, CO2 EOR with storage option produces 30\u201340% less exergy compared to conventional CO2 enhanced oil recovery projects with CO2 supplied from natural sources; however, this leads to storage of> 400 kg of extra CO2 per barrel of oil produced.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "dec3d3e2ede7a1335620068d923105f89d49dc67", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2464346728", "DOI": "10.1039/C6RA15325A", "CorpusId": 99839425}, "title": "Controlling high coercivities in cm-scale buckypapers with unusual stacking of vertically aligned and randomly entangled Fe-filled carbon nanotubes", "abstract": "The synthesis of cm-scale buckypapers consisting of an unusual stacking of vertically aligned and randomly entangled Fe-filled carbon nanotubes is revealed through an advanced high flow-rate Cl-assisted chemical vapour deposition approach.

We carried out this estimation in three steps. First, we developed a sector- and region-specific regression model for IWW. The model utilized and analyzed cross-country panel data using historical statistics of IWW for 10 sectors and 42 countries. Second, we estimated historical IWW by applying a regression model. Third, we projected future IWW from the output of AIM/CGE. For future projections, we considered and included multiple socioeconomic assumptions, namely different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) with and without climate mitigation policy. In all of the baseline scenarios, IWW was projected to increase throughout the twenty-first century, but growth through the latter half of the century is likely to be modest mainly due to the effects of decreased water use intensity. The projections for global total IWW ranged from 461 to 1,560\u00a0km3/year in 2050 and from 196 to 1,463\u00a0km3/year in 2100. The effects of climate mitigation on IWW were both negative and positive, depending on the SSPs. We attributed differences among scenarios to the balance between the choices of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and renewable energy. A smaller share of CCS was accompanied by a larger share of non-thermal renewable energy, which requires a smaller amount of water withdrawal per unit of energy production.

Important factors influencing the structure and dynamics of confined liquids include the average pore size and pore size distribution, the degree of pore interconnection, and the character of the liquid\u2013surface interaction. While confinement of liquids in hydrophobic matrices, such as carbon nanotubes, or near the surfaces of mixed character, such as many proteins, has also been an area of rapidly growing interest, the confining matrices of interest to earth and materials sciences usually contain oxide structural units and thus are hydrophilic. The pore size distribution and the degree of porosity and inter-connection vary greatly amongst porous matrices. Vycor, xerogels, aerogels, and rocks possess irregular porous structures, whereas mesoporous silicas (e.g., SBA-15, MCM-41, MCM-48), zeolites, and layered systems, for instance clays, have high degrees of internal order. The pore type and size may be tailored by means of adjusting the synthesis regimen. In clays, the interlayer distance may depend on the level of hydration. Although studied less frequently, matrices such as artificial opals and chrysotile asbestos represent other interesting examples of ordered porous structures. The properties of neutrons make them an ideal probe for comparing the properties of bulk fluids with those in confined geometries. In this chapter, we provide a brief review of research performed on liquids confined in materials of interest to the earth and material sciences (silicas, aluminas, zeolites, clays, rocks, etc.), emphasizing those neutron scattering techniques that assess both structural modification and dynamical behavior.

CCS represents one option in a larger portfolio of mitigation strategies for climate change. It consists of three distinct technological stages: separation, capture, and storage (also referred to as sequestration). CO2 released by combustion processes in power plants is separated from other emissions and captured. After transport to a suitable storage location, CO2 is isolated for extended periods to prevent its release into the atmosphere.

This requires a detailed study of thermal\u2010hydro\u2010mechanical\u2010chemical coupled phenomena that can be triggered in the reservoir formation, most readily achieved through laboratory simulations of CO2 injection into typical reservoir formations. Here, we present the first results from a new experimental apparatus of a steady\u2010state drainage flooding test conducted through a synthetic sandstone sample, simulating real CO2 storage reservoir conditions in a shallow (\u223c1 km), low permeability \u223c1mD, 26% porosity sandstone formation. The injected pore fluid comprised brine with CO2 saturation increasing in steps of 20% brine/CO2 partial flow rates up to 100% CO2 flow. At each pore fluid stage, an unload/loading cycle of effective pressure was imposed to study the response of the rock under different geomechanical scenarios. The monitoring included axial strains and relative permeability in a continuous mode (hydromechanical assessment), and related geophysical signatures (ultrasonic P\u2010wave and S\u2010wave velocities Vp and Vs, and attenuations Qp\u22121 and Qs\u22121, respectively, and electrical resistivity). On average, the results showed Vp and Vs dropped \u223c7% and \u223c4% respectively during the test, whereas Qp\u22121 increased \u223c55% and Qs\u22121 decreased by \u223c25%. From the electrical resistivity data, we estimated a maximum CO2 saturation of \u223c0.5, whereas relative permeability curves were adjusted for both fluids. Comparing the experimental results to theoretical predictions, we found that Gassmann's equations explain Vp at high and very low CO2 saturations, whereas bulk modulus yields results consistent with White and Dutta\u2013Od\u00e9 model predictions. This is interpreted as a heterogeneous distribution of the two pore fluid phases, corroborated by electrical resistivity tomography images.

Under climate change, its phenology is presumed to be changing and mass infestations becoming more likely. While several studies have investigated climate effects across a latitudinal gradient, it remains an open question how phenology will change depending on elevation and topology. Knowing how an altered climate is likely to affect bark beetle populations, particularly across diverse topographies and elevations, is essential for adaptive management. We developed a time\u2010varying distributed delay model to predict the phenology of I. typographus. This approach has the particular advantage of capturing the variability within populations and thus representing its stage structure at any time. The model is applied for three regional climate change scenarios, A1B, A2 and RCP3PD, to the diverse topography of Switzerland, covering a large range of elevations, aspects and slopes. We found a strong negative relationship between voltinism and elevation. Under climate change, the model predicts an increasing number of generations over the whole elevational gradient, which will be more pronounced at low elevations. In contrast, the pre\u2010shift in spring swarming is expected to be greater at higher elevations. In comparison, the general trend of faster beetle development on steep southern slopes is only of minor importance. Overall, the maximum elevation allowing a complete yearly generation will move upwards. Generally, the predicted increase in number of generations, earlier spring swarming, more aggregated swarming, together with a projected increase in drought and storm events, will result in a higher risk of mass infestations.
