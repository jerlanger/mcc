This study presents results of comprehensive investigations along a 500-m long profile within the Hartou\u0161ov (Czech Republic) natural CO2 degassing site and gives structural information about the subsurface and interaction processes in relation to parameters measured. Measurements of CO2 concentrations and investigation of the subsurface using electrical resistivity tomography and self-potential methods provide information about subsurface properties. For their successful application it is necessary to take seasonal variations (e.g., soil moisture, temperature, meteorological conditions) into consideration due to their influence on these parameters. Locations of high CO2 concentration in shallow depths are related to positive self-potential anomalies, low soil moistures and high resistivity distributions, as well as high \u03b413C values and increased radon concentrations. CO2 ascends from deep geological sources via preferential pathways and accumulates in coarser sediments. Repetition of measurements (which includes the effects of seasonal variations) revealed similar trends and allows us to identify a clear, prominent zone of anomalous values. Coarser unconsolidated sedimentary layers are beneficial for the accumulation of CO2 gas. The distribution of such shallow geological structures needs to be considered as a significant environmental risk potential whenever sudden degassing of large gas volumes occurs.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "0620348ed0bdf3dd1ff9ef808acf852926425db1", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 13596936}, "title": "Estimation of CO2 Storage Capacity in Geological Media - Phase 2 - Prepared by the Task Force on CO2 Storage Capacity Estimation for the Technical Group (TG) of the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF)", "abstract": "Task Force was created to review and identify standards for CO2 storage capacity estimation. Force has previously issued a Phase I report (in August 2005) which served to document the nature of the problem such as the relationship between assessment scale and the level of detail and resolution of the storage capacity. This report of the Task Force's Phase II activities summarizes the Phase I findings and provides suggested methodologies for the estimation of CO2 storage capacity in three types of geologic structures: uneconomic coal beds, oil and gas reservoirs, and deep saline aquifers. Executive Summary Implementation of CO 2 capture and geological storage (CCGS) technology at the scale needed to achieve a significant and meaningful reduction in CO 2 emissions requires knowledge of the available CO 2 storage capacity. Previous attempts to assess CO 2 storage capacity used a variety of approaches and methodologies, and data sets of variable size and quality, resulting in widely varying estimates of inconsistent quality and reliability. CO 2 storage capacity can be conceptualized as a resource pyramid, in which the degree of geological and economic uncertainty associated with a capacity estimate is represented by its place on the pyramid. In essence, the best-known and highest quality capacity is placed at the apex of the pyramid and the poorly known and/or poor quality capacity is placed at its base. Theoretical storage capacity, which is defined as the physical limit of what the geological system can accept, is represented by the entire pyramid. The effective storage capacity is a subset of the theoretical capacity and is obtained by applying a range geological and engineering cutoff limits to a storage capacity assessment. The practical storage capacity is that subset of the effective capacity that is obtained by considering other technical, legal and regulatory, infrastructure and economic barriers to CO 2 geological storage. The matched storage capacity is that subset of the practical capacity that is obtained by detailed matching of large stationary CO 2 sources with geological storage sites that are adequate in terms of capacity, injectivity and supply rate. CO 2 storage capacity assessments may be conducted at a variety of scales. The country-scale assessment is a high level of assessment performed for a contiguous geographic area defined by national jurisdiction.

The confined release involves a \u00bd\u201d diameter jet discharging into a largely-enclosed steel container of dimensions 6 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 metres. Measurements of temperature and concentration in the dispersing CO2 plumes were obtained for these tests from experiments commissioned by Shell at the GL Spadeadam facility. The integral model used is Shell FRED, which adopts a semi-empirical jet model for the momentumdominated part of the release and a similarity model for the subsequent dense gas dispersion, if required. FRED assumes Homogeneous Equilibrium (HE) between the CO2 particles and the vapour phase, i.e. the particles and surrounding vapour share the same temperature and velocity. Since FRED was primarily designed for hydrocarbon hazards it does not actually consider solid particles but, rather, the liquid-vapour line is extrapolated down to atmospheric pressure and the particles are treated as liquid; the effect of this approximation is discussed. Two different CFD dispersion models are tested: the first has been developed in the OpenFOAM CFD software and assumes HE, whilst the second has been developed in Ansys-CFX and uses a particle-tracking approach to simulate the sublimating solid CO2 particles. Both FRED and the two CFD models account for the latent heat effects associated with humidity and the condensation of water vapour in the cold CO2 cloud. The results from the model comparisons are used to assess the suitability of fast consequence models like FRED to simulate unconfined jet releases of dense phase CO2.

Considering 7.2 M ha are dedicated to winegrape production globally, the potential for annual C capture and storage in this crop is of interest to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we used destructive sampling to measure C stocks in the woody biomass of 15-year-old Cabernet Sauvignon vines from a vineyard in California\u2019s northern San Joaquin Valley. We characterize C stocks in terms of allometric variation between biomass fractions of roots, aboveground wood, canes, leaves and fruits, and then test correlations between easy-to-measure variables such as trunk diameter, pruning weights and harvest weight to vine biomass fractions. Carbon stocks at the vineyard block scale were validated from biomass mounds generated during vineyard removal. Results Total vine C was estimated at 12.3 Mg C ha\u22121, of which 8.9 Mg C ha\u22121 came from perennial vine biomass. Annual biomass was estimated at 1.7 Mg C ha\u22121 from leaves and canes and 1.7 Mg C ha\u22121 from fruit. Strong, positive correlations were found between the diameter of the trunk and overall woody C stocks (R2 = 0.85), pruning weights and leaf and fruit C stocks (R2 = 0.93), and between fruit weight and annual C stocks (R2 = 0.96). Conclusions Vineyard C partitioning obtained in this study provides detailed C storage estimations in order to understand the spatial and temporal distribution of winegrape C.

The model results available at the time suggested that, \u201cuse of CCS in conjunction with other measures could significantly reduce the cost of achieving stabilization and would increase flexibility in achieving these reductions\u201d1. Today, energy system modellers interested in finding cost effective pathways to tackling climate change consistently confirm this conclusion. In Carbon Capture, Howard J. Herzog provides a comprehensive, but succinct, introduction to CCS covering the topics that are essential for understanding if, and how, CCS can do what the models suggest. Carbon Capture lays out Herzog\u2019s perspective on the current state of the art methods, presenting an accessible introduction to the range of technology that may be encountered in the field, alongside the broader context (ranging from climate change science to policy and politics) in which CCS is developed and deployed. The analysis is rigorous but the presentation is clear \u2014 and only a minimal previous knowledge of the relevant underpinning science is assumed. Each chapter includes well-chosen examples to aid understanding, and a useful bibliography. Herzog argues that CCS is a \u201cpromising but overlooked climate change mitigation pathway\u201d. Public awareness of CCS remains relatively low and many policymakers are yet to be fully convinced of its value. Arguably, one of the most significant challenges (and opportunities) for CCS is that it is not one solution, but several. Much of the early focus of CCS research and development was targeted at coal-fired power generation. Today, there is increasing interest in the role CCS could play in significantly reducing CO2 emissions from a wider range of fuels (for example, natural gas, biomass and waste-derived fuel) and other large industrial sources (for example, refineries, steel-making and cement production). A chapter is devoted to \u2018negative emissions technologies\u2019 that remove CO2 from the atmosphere, either directly or by using biomass-enhanced CCS. There is \u201cconsiderable disagreement\u201d about the role that these technologies can and should play. If we are able to remove significant amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere it could be a game changer in responding to global climate change. Herzog is concerned though, that \u201cmore and more people are embracing this concept because it excuses pushing hard policy decisions regarding emissions reductions down the road\u201d. CCS implementation uses a wide variety of technologies and draws on a broad range of science. There are several options for CO2 capture. To be effective for climate change mitigation, the main criteria is that captured CO2 remains out of the atmosphere for a thousand years or more. Thus, in general, \u201cgeologic storage of CO2 is the mirror image of oil and gas production\u201d. CO2 is injected into porous geologic formations deep under the Earth\u2019s surface, where four different trapping processes (structural, capillary, solubility and mineral) ensure that it stays there. CCS is unique because its primary purpose is to tackle climate change. Although the constituent technologies typically are not new, Herzog suggests that integrated CCS (CO2 capture, transport and storage) is currently the \u201cnew kid on the block\u201d in energy policy. Economists generally agree that \u2018market pull\u2019 (typically putting a price on CO2 and, hence, creating a market for CCS) should be the most cost-effective approach, but this requires widespread political agreement to introduce and sustain a sufficiently robust CO2 price. \u2018Technology push\u2019 policies are also an option (for example, tax credits in the United States and government-backed competitions in the United Kingdom). Although they are sometimes viewed as inefficient, they have the benefit that support can be tailored specifically to encourage the development and deployment of particular technologies. The broad range of technology and policy considerations is, of course, also a challenge for anyone writing an introduction to CCS \u2014 particularly one intended to be a concise introduction for non-specialists \u2014 but Herzog rises to the challenge. He provides a comprehensive, yet clear, narrative, touching on all the themes that matter in understanding the current state of play for CCS and its potential for the future. In fact, Carbon Capture can be seen as a series of introductory lectures for a general audience. There is a careful balance between personal reflection and providing relevant factual information, typical of a high-quality public lecture. For me, it is the perfect text to recommend to my more experienced students as they look to grasp the technical fundamentals of options like CCS without needing to engage with a full textbook. It should also be essential reading for anyone curious about why modelling studies have repeatedly suggested that CCS should be part of global efforts to decarbonise our economies at an affordable cost. Herzog does not provide a detailed review of this literature, although as he looks to the future he does refer to work by the International Energy Agency, which concluded that \u201cwithout CCS, the transformation of the power sector will be at least USD 3.5 trillion more expensive\u201d2. Overall, Carbon Capture achieves Herzog\u2019s aim of helping people understand what carbon capture is all about. He provides a comprehensive but accessible introduction to key technologies that are globally relevant. This is complemented by insightful review, a useful introduction to key projects where carbon capture can be seen in action today, and analysis of key motives for developing and implementing CCS. What remains to be seen is whether CCS can move beyond its status as a \u201cpromising but overlooked\u201d option for climate change mitigation, to become a significant contributor in reducing global CO2 emissions. \u2750", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "90fc0d8ce4a0013395d555c2113237b7eea3d9aa", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2883289081", "DOI": "10.5937/PODRAD1832061T", "CorpusId": 56316886}, "title": "Criteria for CO2 storage in geological formations", "abstract": "CO2 storage in geological formations represents today one of the main new technological solutions for CO2 emission mitigation.

The results show that without any emission reduction measures, the total carbon emissions of methanol industry in 2020 would be 4.84 times larger than that of 2011.

New data have upended the traditional model of stabilization, which held that stable SOM was mostly made of undecomposed plant molecules. We now know that microbial by-products and dead cells comprise unexpectedly large amounts of stable SOM because they can become attached to mineral surfaces or physically protected within soil aggregates. SOM models have been built to incorporate the microbial to mineral stabilization of organic matter, but now face a new challenge of accurately capturing microbial productivity and metabolism. Explicitly representing stoichiometry, the relative nutrient requirements for growth and maintenance of organisms, could provide a way forward. Stoichiometry limits SOM formation and turnover in nature, but important nutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S) are often missing from the new generation of SOM models. In this synthesis, we seek to facilitate the addition of these nutrients to SOM models by (1) reviewing the stoichiometric bias\u2014the tendency to favor one element over another\u2014of four key processes in the new framework of SOM cycling and (2) applying this knowledge to build a stoichiometrically explicit budget of C, N, P, and S flow through the major SOM pools. By quantifying the role of stoichiometry in SOM cycling, we discover that constraining the C:N:P:S ratio of microorganisms and SOM to specific values reduces uncertainty in C and nutrient flow as effectively as using microbial C use efficiency (CUE) parameters. We find that the value of additional constraints on stoichiometry vs. CUE varies across ecosystems, depending on how precise the available data is for that ecosystem and which biogeochemical pathways are present. Moreover, because CUE summarizes many different processes, stoichiometric measurements of key soil pools are likely to be more robust when extrapolated from soil incubations to plot or biome scale estimates.

It is the only technology that can turn high carbon fuels into genuinely low carbon electricity and is viewed as a critical technology to develop. As part of a larger \u00a31Bn programme the UK has a \u00a3125 million cross-government carbon capture and storage research, development and innovation programme with projects running out to 2018. The paper will address the role of both passive and active acoustics for the wide area Monitoring, Measurement and Verification (MMV) of carbon dioxide leaking from the seabed and infrastructure being conducted as a UK pilot programme. Whilst it will predominantly address shallow water operations in the North Sea, it will address the differing challenges of detecting leaking CO2 in deeper water. Findings and observations from multiple academic and commercial research studies conducted in support of UK governmental policy on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) will be reported.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "265b2041f0ee6f55a4162634dbf8db288129ce4c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2757307856", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-017-2077-y", "CorpusId": 158700976}, "title": "Constant elasticity of substitution functions for energy modeling in general equilibrium integrated assessment models: a critical review and recommendations", "abstract": "Applying constant elasticity of substitution (CES) functions in general equilibrium integrated assessment models (GE-IAMs) for the substitution of technical factor inputs (e.g., replacing fossil fuels) fails to match historically observed patterns in energy transition dynamics.

The resulting methodology-related artifacts are (i) the extension of the status quo technology shares for future energy supply relying on fossil fuels with carbon capture, biomass, and nuclear; (ii) monotonically increasing marginal abatement costs of carbon; and (iii) substitution of energy with non-physical inputs (e.g., knowledge and capital) without conclusive evidence that this is possible to the extent modeled. We demonstrate these issues using simple examples and analyze how they are relevant in the case of four major CES-based GE-IAMs. To address this, we propose alternative formulations either by opting for carefully applied perfect substitution for alternative energy options or by introducing dynamically variable elasticity of substitution as a potential intermediate solution.

In order to evaluate whether this unique phenomenon could be attributed to geochemical changes, reactive transport modeling was conducted to investigate CO2-water-rock interactions and changes in porosity and permeability induced by CO2 injection. The results indicated that using porosity-permeability relationships that include tortuosity, grain size, and percolation porosity, other than typical Kozeny-Carman porosity-permeability relationship, it is possible to explain the considerable injectivity increase as a consequence of mineral dissolution. These models might be justified in terms of selective dissolution along flow paths and by dissolution or migration of plugging fines.

Quadrat variance analysis revealed spatial variation in SOC and TN at two scales. The larger scale variation (40\u201345\u2003m) was approximately the distance between centers of woody plant communities and their adjoining herbaceous patches. The smaller scale variation (10\u2003m) appeared to reflect the local influence of shrubs on SOC and TN. Litter, root biomass, shrub, and tree basal area (a proxy for plant age) exhibited not only similar spatial scales, but also strong correlations with SOC and TN, suggesting invasive woody plants alter both the storage and spatial scaling of SOC and TN through ecological processes related primarily to root turnover and, to a lesser extent litter production, as mediated by time of occupancy. Forb and grass biomass were not significantly correlated with SOC and TN suggesting that changes in herbaceous vegetation have not been the driving force for the observed changes in SOC and TN. Because SOC and TN varied at two scales, it would be inappropriate to estimate SOC and TN pools at broad scales by extrapolating from point sampling at fine scales.

The analysis shows that CCS will be a key mitigation option at a global level for carbon mitigation, achieving about 30% of the electricity mix in 2100 (with a homogeneous distribution across coal, gas, and biomass) if its deployment is unconstrained. If CCS deployment is delayed or forbidden, penetration cannot reach the optimal unconstrained level, resulting in a mix rearrangement, with a strong increase in renewables and, to a lesser extent, nuclear.

Cellulose is found to be a reliable, cheap and sustainable support for a range of SoILs, reducing the total sorbent cost by improving the efficiency of the ionic liquid through increased ionic surface area that results from coating.

One of the main obstacles for quantitative MVA activities arises from the nature of the saturation distribution, typically classified anywhere from homogeneous to patchy. The emerging saturation distribution, in turn, regulates the relationship between compressional velocity and saturation. In this work, we carry out multiphase flow simulations in a 2-D aquifer model with a log-normal absolute permeability distribution and a capillary pressure function parametrized by permeability. The heterogeneity level is tuned by assigning the value of the Dykstra-Parson (DP) coefficient, which sets the variance of the log-normal horizontal permeability distribution in the entire domain.

The key conclusions are as follows: (a) the achievement of negative emissions in the power sector via the use of biomass with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) allows for much more limited decarbonization in the buildings and transport sectors; (b) CCS is also extensively used for decarbonization of the industrial sector; (c) because of the absence in the model of options for transport mode-switching and building fabric efficiency improvements, the transport and buildings sectors achieve relatively little abatement by 2050 \u2013 the inclusion of these options could considerably reduce the need for BECCS and the cost of abatement; (d) decarbonization of the EU\u2019s energy system by 2050 would increase energy system costs by 14% compared to a Reference scenario with no CO2 constraints; and (e) average EU-wide marginal CO2 abatement costs in Policy Success reach $300/tCO2 in 2050.

Furthermore, we found that the CO can be easily released from the materials by simply dipping the networks into an organic solvent for less than 1 min, at ambient temperature and pressure, which not only offers a straightforward recycling method, but also a new method for the \"on-demand\" release of carbon monoxide. We illustrated the utilization of the on-demand release of CO from the networks by carrying out a carbonylation reaction on an electron-deficient metal complex that led to the formation of the CO-adduct, with concomitant recycling of the gel. We anticipate that our sponge-like materials and scalable methodology will open up new avenues for the storage, transport, and controlled release of CO, the silent killer and a major industrial poison.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "fa27740310094935a038b80df44e90646bff6a4f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2796207740", "DOI": "10.1029/2006GB002856", "CorpusId": 73652205}, "title": "Mackenzie River nutrient delivery to the Arctic Ocean and effects of the Mackenzie Delta during open water conditions", "abstract": "Large rivers have a strong influence on the Arctic Ocean, but little attention has been given to the biogeochemical effect that lake\u2010rich delta floodplains may have on river waters prior to marine discharge.

Using a new estimate of peak off\u2010channel water storage in the delta floodplain, a two\u2010source mixing model was developed (channel water plus recovery of off\u2010channel water) to estimate the volume\u2010weighted nutrient composition of river water after the off\u2010channel water was recovered from the delta during the hydrograph recession period.

Our results generally indicate the Mackenzie Delta has an important effect on the magnitude and quality of riverine particulates and nutrients prior to entering the sea. Such an effect has not been quantified in prior work and is likely to be important in other arctic rivers with lake\u2010rich deltas. Our enhanced sampling of the high\u2010discharge period during early hydrograph recession has also better captured the detailed composition of C, N, and P constituents in the river water, ultimately leading to improved estimates of nutrient levels and overall nutrient quality for the open water period that differ appreciably from prior observations on the Mackenzie River.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "7539613eb35dcbc9c50cf5ccbee9a32a231ec5d4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3048365430", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.iecr.0c02165", "CorpusId": 225379950}, "title": "Carbonyl-Incorporated Aromatic Hyper-Cross-Linked Polymers with Microporous Structure and Their Functional Materials for CO2 Adsorption", "abstract": "As promising adsorbents in carbon capture and storage, hyper-cross-linked polymers (HCPs) require high CO2 uptake and selectivity over N2 and CH4.

Use of coal alone accounts for 43% of global CO2 emission in 2010. As the most abundant, the most reliable and cheap energy source, coal will continue to play a significant role in the world\u2019s economy and improving people\u2019s standard of living in particular in the developing countries. With the strong demand for coal, there is no doubt that the CO2 emissions will continue to rise. On May 9, 2013, the daily mean concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Mauna Loa, Hawaii, surpassed 400 ppm for the first time since measurements began in 1958. The rate of increase is ca 2.1 ppm per year during the last 10 years. Without significant reduction of CO2 emissions, it is unlikely to limit the long-term concentration of greenhouse gasses to 450 ppm CO2 by 2050. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a process CO2 is separated from large point sources, including fossil fuel power plants, and transported to a disposal site, normally an underground geological formation, for permanent storage. It is generally agreed that CCS is the only technology available to make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions while still using fossil fuels and much of today\u2019s energy infrastructure. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), CCS will account for 19% of total emissions reduction if the global CO2 emissions are halved by 2050. However, looking back, there has been great uncertainty surrounding the commercial implementation of CCS technologies. Despite the fact that all the necessary components of CCS process are commercially available, the question about the large scale CO2 storage remains. The progress towards the commercial deployment of CCS technologies is slow. A number of factors contribute to a slow progress of CCS development. Firstly, the CCS projects are very costly. Most studies estimate that CCS will add more than 50% to the cost of electricity from coal. The costs for the first commercial CCS plants will be much higher than the following projects. No one wants to take the risk to be the first one. Secondly, CCS depends on the political polices to drive it. There is no a legally binding agreement on the emissions reduction applied to all countries and there is no market for CCS. Last but not the least, CCS depends on the government support. In an unfavourably financial environment, the R & D spending is expected to decline. Recently Australian government has announced a budget cut of $500 million over three years to its national CCS flagship program, almost one third of the total funding from the federal government. The Australia\u2019s opposition party has even pledged to abolish the carbon tax if elected in September 2013. So, what is the future for CCS? It is a difficult question to answer. A critical issue is who is going to pay for the development of CCS. It should be pointed out that the majority of the upcoming projects use captured CO2 for enhanced oil recovery. The reason for that is EOR can facilitate the development of CCS by improving the financial viability of the CCS, building the infrastructure required for CCS, and developing capability along the supply chain. An increase in EOR projects reflexes the importance of CO2 utilisation. Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) is gaining increased attention in particular in USA and China. It is unlikely for the developing counties to deploy the CCS technologies with financial support from the government alone. In these countries the priorities are to sustain the economic growth and improve people\u2019s living standard. To move CCS forward, it is important to realise the challenges facing the CCS development and make appropriate adjustment based on the political and economic realities. Considering that the funding on the development of CCS is limited, the international R & D program needs to be well coordinated and have the right focus and the right scale to avoid unproductive overlap between demonstration projects and ensure that limited resources are spent wisely to achieve the highest benefits.

A mechanical method was used for pelletization of the powdered materials, namely K2CO3-doped lithium silicate (Li4SiO4).

The small existing CO2 pipeline infrastructure may eventually have to be expanded to be comparable in size to the country's natural gas pipeline system. To build out a national CO2 pipeline system, the U.S. will need to create a workable regulatory framework. Today, CO2 pipeline developers have no access to federal siting or federal eminent domain authority for construction of such pipelines; rather, they must deal with a patchwork of individual state laws and regulations. The shape of any applicable economic regulation, including rules on rate and access regulation, will also need to be resolved and addressed before project sponsors will build pipelines to support CCS. This article provides policymakers with analysis and recommendations respecting the federal regulatory regime governing the construction and operation of CO2 pipelines. The article recommends that existing CO2 pipelines remain subject to state level regulation principally because the current state schemes in place can support the purpose for which they were built, which was not a national-level GHG emission reduction program. However, new pipelines should be able to elect to apply for federal permits for construction and operation similar to those granted for natural gas pipelines. Once a federal permit is issued, the project sponsor would not be subject to state siting requirements and would have eminent domain authority similar to that provided interstate natural gas pipelines. When operational, CO2 pipelines for which a federal permit is issued would be subject to federal common carrier regulation. This recommended framework should better support construction of the new CO2 pipeline infrastructure necessary for widespread deployment of CCS. I. INTRODUCTION As discussion of a federal regulatory program for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) and otiier greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continues in the United States, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has emerged as a key technology option for CO2 emissions abatement. This article surveys the current regulatory regime in place for CO2 pipeline transportation and suggests areas for further evaluation. It outlines background information about CO2 transport, summarizes the current state of CO2 pipeline regulation under federal and state law, evaluates existing law in areas that may be important for a national CO2 pipeline system, discusses alternative regulatory frameworks that could be considered to support development and operation of a much larger CO2 pipeline network, and concludes with recommendations for reform. II. BACKGROUND CCS is regarded as \"the critical enabling technology\" for reducing CO2 emissions significantly while allowing the continued use of coal and other fossil fuels to meet energy needs.1 While numerous efforts are underway to understand the behavior of injected CO2 in storage formations,2 and to develop rules for siting of injection sites/ comparatively less attention has been paid to CO2 transportation infrastructure issues that could arise. CCS is me process in which CO2 - die most common GHG - is separated from the process and exhaust streams of electric generation units and omer large emissions sources, compressed, and injected into underground formations to prevent its release into me atmosphere.4 The large volumes of CO2 are compressed for injection onsite or transportation to a storage site with suitable geology. CO2 is transported as a supercritical fluid (a substance above critical temperature and pressure points exhibiting characteristics of both a liquid and a gas), which maximizes pipeline efficiency.5 From an operational perspective, pipeline diameters are sized according to operating parameters so that CO2 remains supercritical fluid throughout transport. \u2026", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "7192527c1ba9af49b3e8e329c045c36b8fb7cab5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2952204788", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJEPES.2019.05.079", "CorpusId": 197435858}, "title": "Adjustable robust power dispatch with combined wind-storage system and carbon capture power plants under low-carbon economy", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "b79b448fb9a10b0c97e06f491853b5952fdabd13", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3045645249", "DOI": "10.1021/acsami.0c09554", "CorpusId": 221348121, "PubMed": "32846501"}, "title": "Effect of Extended Aging and Oxidation on Linear Poly(propylenimine)-Mesoporous Silica Composites for CO2 Capture from Simulated Air and Flue Gas Streams.", "abstract": "Physical aging or degradation of amine-containing polymers and supported amine adsorbents is a critical issue that could limit the practical application of such materials for CO2 capture. However, to date, there is a scarcity of studies that evaluate the long-term stability of amine-based sorbents without the exclusive use of accelerated aging tests. Here, we demonstrate that extended aging (\u223c2 years) of linear poly(propylenimine) (LPPI) confined in mesoporous silica (SBA-15) supports does not drastically impact the CO2 adsorption performance under simulated flue gas (10% CO2) and direct air capture (DAC, 400 ppm CO2) conditions, although the behavior of the aged sorbents and polymers in the two CO2 concentration regimes differs. The sorbents made with aged LPPI have modestly decreased CO2 uptake performance (\u227220% lower) compared to the fresh polymers, with overall good CO2 cycling performance. The data indicate that only slow degradation occurs under the deployed ambient storage conditions. Even after extended aging, the LPPI-based sorbents preserved their ability to display stable temperature-swing cycling performance. In parallel, the impact of blending LPPI polymers of different number-average molecular weights, Mn, is evaluated, seeking to understand its impact on adsorbent performance. The results demonstrate that the blends of two Mn aged LPPI give similar CO2 adsorption performance to adsorbents made from a single-Mn LPPI, suggesting that molecular weight will not negatively impact adsorbent performance in the studied Mn range. After an accelerated oxidation experiment, the aged LPPI sorbents retained a larger portion of the samples' original performance when cycling under simulated flue gas conditions than under DAC conditions. However, in each case, the oxidized sorbents could be cycled repeatedly with consistent uptake performance. Overall, these first of their kind extended aging tests suggest that LPPI-based amine adsorbents offer promise for long-term, stable use in carbon capture applications.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "ac102cd6f28833ce869bfb4c4c9f8598685d2e6a", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 10257238}, "title": "Flue gas treatment for CO 2 capture", "abstract": "This report is in two sections: the first describes the flue gas and its treatment in post-combustion capture and the second covers the flue gas in oxyfuel combustion capture. The main components of the flue gas in pulverised coal combustion for postcombustion capture are CO2, N2, O2 and H2O, and air pollutants such as SOx, NOx, particulates, HCl, HF, mercury as well as other contaminants. The most widespread method of post-combustion capture of CO2 is by solvent absorption. Coal-fired power plants already have units to remove air pollutants prior to CO2 capture, such as FGD, SCR, and ESP. However, some pollutants will be absorbed in the solvent with the CO2 and can lead to the formation of heat stable salts. The FGD process may need to be improved to reduce SOx emissions to an acceptable level for post-combustion capture. The flue gas stream from oxyfuel combustion is composed mainly of CO2 and H2O. It will also contain O2, SOx, NOx, HCl, Hg, any diluents from the O2 stream, and various inerts such as N2 and Ar. Condensing, compression and cooling of the flue gas are required to obtain CO2 of an acceptable purity for transport and storage. Various processes are being developed to raise the purity of CO2 produced from oxyfuel combustion. Air Products have developed a membrane to separate CO2 from a feed gas; Air Liquide have developed a compression and purification unit; Linde are developing a fast catalytic deNOx process and an alkali based wash unit for removal of NOx and SOx; and Praxair are developing oxygen enhanced coal combustion to reduce NOx emissions without resorting to complete oxyfuel combustion. Finally, the ThermoEnergy Integrated Power System enables the condensing heat exchanger to collect particulates, acid gases and mercury into a condensed phase. Despite this ongoing research, at present the issue of CO2 optimum product purity is a question that does not have a satisfactory answer.

Keeping cognizance of country's energy requirement and commitment to climate change, embarking upon technologies having minimal carbon footprint is the need of the hour. Carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) is one such technology which offers dual benefits of carbon sequestration & enhancing oil production from mature oils fields. This paper outlines ONGC's efforts in bringing nation's first CO2-EOR project.\n In view of non-availability of natural CO2 sources in India, usage of anthropogenic CO2 captured from thermal power plants was conceptualised. Based upon CO2 source-sink matching exercise and favourable reservoir & fluid parameters, two oil fields were screened. Technical feasibility of CO2-EOR was first ascertained in laboratory by determination of minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) of CO2 through slim tube experiments. Encouraged by laboratory results, full field compositional simulation studies along with fluid characterization inputs from PVT simulator were carried out.\n The MMP were found to be in range 190-250 Ksc, which is below the initial reservoir pressures of the targeted reservoirs. The proposed scheme entails drilling of around 70-80 wells inclusive of both producers & injectors and has the potential to yield an incremental recovery between 10-14 %. A sensitivity analysis based upon purity of CO2 and its adverse effect on MMP was carried out in terms of reduced oil recoveries. Since, this shall be a CCUS project, CO2 from the produced stream has to be separated, compressed and reinjected in a closed loop system. Around 5-8 MMT of CO2 will be sequestrated through Structural, Solubility and Residual trapping mechanisms as modelled in compositional simulator. IFT reduction & decrease in Sor (Residual oil saturation) as result of swelling, miscibility of CO2 with native oil were also modelled in simulator. Being first of its kind project in India, there are many inherent challenges to the CCUS project. At the source end, capturing CO2 from flue gas stream and its compression & transportation is a cost and energy intensive process. At the Sink end, CO2 being acidic and corrosive gas will need retrofit modifications in terms of special corrosion resistant metallurgy for existing processing facilities.\n The learning curve from this endeavour shall create knowledge base to further expand deployment of CCUS in India, bringing a large portfolio of reservoirs under the ambit of CO2-EOR. Success of CCUS in India will not only increase domestic oil production but also cater to address the National INDC of reducing emission intensity of GDP by 33-35 percent by 2030 as per Paris agreement.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "816daf54e47c11d4ec932534e3a3d2fa0356a0b4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3197785171", "DOI": "10.1007/s40789-021-00458-w", "CorpusId": 239681541}, "title": "The view of technological innovation in coal industry under the vision of carbon neutralization", "abstract": "This paper analyzed the current situation and development trends\u00a0of energy consumption and carbon emissions, and\u00a0the current situation and development trend of coal consumption\u00a0in China.

Globally, as of September 2018, there are 23 large-scale CCS facilities in operation and under construction, capturing ~ 40 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of CO2.

Nowadays, the portfolio of CCS facilities covers a diverse range of sectors, including power generation, iron and steel manufacturing, cement production, chemical and hydrogen production, and bioenergy.

That pipeline currently includes six large-scale facilities in advanced development and 14 in early development. However, the current pipeline of large-scale CCS deployment does not go anywhere near the envisaged role of CCS to meet the Paris Agreement climate goals.

Rather, organ growth appears driven by sink activity in which water availability plays a determinant role. Current functional-structural plant models (FSPMs) mainly focus on plant-carbon relations and largely disregard the importance of plant water status in organogenesis. Consequently, incorporating a turgor-driven growth concept, coupling carbon and water dynamics in an FSPM, presents a significant improvement towards capturing plant development in a more mechanistic manner.\n\n\nMethods\nAn existing process-based water flow and storage model served as a basis for implementing water control in FSPMs. Its concepts were adjusted to the scale of individual plant organs and interwoven with the basic principles of modelling carbon dynamics to allow evaluation of turgor pressure across the entire plant. This was then linked to plant organ growth by applying the principles of the widely used Lockhart equation.\n\n\nKey results\nThis model successfully integrates a mechanistic understanding of plant water transport dynamics coupled with simple carbon dynamics within a dynamically developing plant architecture. It allows evaluation of turgor pressure on the scale of plant organs, resulting in clear diel and long-term patterns, directly linked to plant organ growth.\n\n\nConclusions\nA conceptual sap flow and turgor-driven growth model was introduced for functional-structural plant modelling. It is applicable to any plant architecture and allows visual exploration of the diel patterns of organ water content and growth.
