This report deals with the development of a methodology for estimating cost-curves of carbon sequestration from afforestation activities and its combination with existing cost-curves of carbon abatement in the energy sector, with an application to the Latin American region. For deriving the carbon supply curves, a bottom-up approach is used where the costs of carbon sequestration are first estimated on individual grids (geo-referenced area of 50 W 50 km), which are aggregated in a single cost curve. In evaluating the carbon sequestration benefits of forests, we intend to capture the life-cycle of the sequestered carbon by accounting the carbon uptake during forest growth, the carbon emissions during the harvest periods, and the residual carbon storage in short-and long-lived products. \n \nFrom a number of model runs we show that (i) the cumulative carbon sequestration by 2010 could amount to about one fourth of the yearly emissions in the regions energy sector, given a carbon price of US$20/tC, (ii) the Latin American region on its own could fulfill the Kyoto Protocol demand on Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) sinks for 2008-2012 at a carbon price of US$26-32/tC, and (iii) when the supply curves of afforestation and energy are combined, the total emission reductions in 2010 are at least 15% larger than in the case of the energy sector alone.

This study proposes, for the first time, an enhanced CCS process (e-CCS), in which the stage of CO2 separation is removed and the flue gas is injected directly in shallow reservoirs located at less than 300 m, where the adsorptive phenomena control CO2 storage. Nitrogen-rich carbon nanospheres were used as modifying agents of the reservoir porous texture to improve both the CO2 adsorption capacity and selectivity.

For such a problem of multi\u2010objective design, no systematic design methodology has been opened in the publicly available literature. Although a numerical simulator can be employed to obtain the wellhead pressure through a series of trial processes of calculations, this will usually need more model parameters and a large number of computations, especially when there are more reservoirs. In this study, an extensible methodological framework for designing a maximum allowable wellhead pressure for CO 2 injection was developed. The methodology is based on a thermal\u2010hydraulic coupling model of wellbore and reservoir flows suitable for arbitrary number of reservoirs. The new methodology can automatically accommodate multiple design objectives, such as site stability and total injection rate. As a result of explicit solutions employed, the methodology has the advantage of less computation and high speed.

Talang in Sumatra as Affected by Pioneer Plants", "abstract": "ABSTRACT To date, no global data on carbon sequestration at the initial weathering phase of tephra deposits are available. To study carbon storage in the new volcanic deposit, tephra layers were reconstructed for a period of 46 months. The tephra samples were collected immediately after eruption of Mount (Mt.) Talang on 12 April 2005, over portions of the Solok District in West Sumatra, Indonesia. Pot experiments were filled with and without soil materials and covered with the collected tephra. The pot experiments were conducted in a wired house. The tephra was applied in 0, 2.5 and 5 cm depths to simulate natural tephra deposition. Every day 250 ml of filtered water was added and allowed to percolate. Solid fraction from the tephra layer was collected and analyzed at regular intervals and primary plant succession was observed over a period of 4 years. After 2 months, blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) started to colonize the bare surface tephra layer to form an algae mat. After 16 months, the surface was transformed into a green biofilm of lichen. Vascular plants (grasses and shrubs) started to be established after 2 years. Total carbon (TC) content of the tephra layer was increased significantly from 0.19 to 1.75% or eight times higher after 46 months of incubation. Higher TC storage was found in the 2.5 cm compared to that of the 5.0 cm tephra layer, which was reconstructed above the soil, with values of 1.75 and 0.89%, respectively. On the contrary, lesser amount of TC was accumulated in the single tephra layer (without soil underneath). Between 71 and 90% of TC was considered as total organic carbon (TOC). The labile organic carbon (LOC) content in the 2.5 cm and 5.0 cm of tephra layer was found to be 0.22 and 0.77%, respectively, at the end of incubation. This experiment confirmed the potential of tephra to capture carbon from the atmosphere with the help of nonvascular plants and then by vascular plants and finally sink them in the tephra layer.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "872282f43fe2626c299136447710b741ed2214b9", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 198935963}, "title": "Assessing Individual Influence on Group Decisions in Geological Carbon Capture and Storage Problems", "abstract": "The inherent uncertainty in information about the Earth\u2019s subsurface requires experts to interpret and reach judgements about geological data based on their individual experience and expertise.

In this regard, direct mineral carbonation of alkaline solid residues is viewed with global interest as they offer permanent and leakage-free storage of CO2. In this research work, CO2 sequestration using Indian coal fly ash (class F type- CaO\u2009<\u200910%) has been studied through the direct mineral carbonation process using flue gas concentration of CO2. Response surface methodology was used to design the carbonation experiments through gas\u2013solid and aqueous routes. Aqueous carbonation of coal fly ash at optimum conditions (temperature-61.6 \u00b0C, pressure-48.7 bar, liquid/solid ratio-13.35, reaction time-50 min) resulted in a reduction of about 23% in the concentration of CO2. The waste exhibited a maximum sequestration capacity of 50.72 g of CO2/kg under aqueous carbonation and 20.03 g of CO2/kg under gas\u2013solid carbonation. Both temperature and pressure were found to be significant factors impacting the gas\u2013solid carbonation process. In aqueous carbonation, temperature and liquid/solid ratio were the significant factors.

Defoliation had no effect on C storage, except in the case of the old leaves of both species, which showed lower C storage levels in response to defoliation. Across treatments, leaf shedding was 96% higher in E. globulus than in L. apiculata while, in contrast, lateral shoot formation was 87% higher in L. apiculata.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn low light, E. globulus prioritized C storage instead of growth, whereas L. apiculata prioritized growth and lateral branching. Our results suggest that shade tolerance depends on efficient light capture rather than C conservation traits.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "d0fd04ea2216367b4b7d1703eca34e5c50ff4db9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1499658718", "DOI": "10.4324/9780203118726-16", "CorpusId": 106831173}, "title": "BEYOND \u2018FOR OR AGAINST\u2019: Environmental NGO-evaluations of CCS as a climate change solution", "abstract": "[About the book] \n \nCarbon capture and storage (CCS) has emerged rapidly as a crucial technological option for decarbonising electricity supply and mitigating climate change.

It is found that, the microscopic molecular states of the adsorbed CH4 and CO2 in nanopores with various size are different.

Currently, shale gas formations are considered as a suitable target for CO2 sequestration projects predominantly due to their wide availability. Compared to conventional geological formations including saline aquifers and coal seams, depleted shale formations provide larger storage potential due to the high adsorption capacity of CO2 compared to methane in the shale formation. However, the injected CO2 causes possible geochemical interactions with the shale formation during storage applications and CO2 enhanced shale gas recovery (ESGR) processes. The CO2/shale interaction is a key factor for the efficiency of CO2 storage in shale formations, as it can significantly alter the shale properties. The formation of carbonic acid from CO2 dissolution is the main cause for the alterations in the physical, chemical and mechanical properties of the shale, which in return affects the storage capacity, pore properties, and fluid transport. Therefore, in this paper, the effect of CO2 exposure on shale properties is comprehensively reviewed, to gain an in-depth understanding of the impact of CO2/shale interaction on shale properties. This paper reviews the current knowledge of the CO2/shale interactions and describes the results achieved to date. The pore structure is one of the most affected properties by CO2/shale interactions; several scholars indicated that the differences in mineral composition for shales would result in wide variations in pore structure system. A noticeable reduction in specific surface area of shales was observed after CO2 treatment, which in the long-term could decrease CO2 adsorption capacity, affecting the CO2 storage efficiency. Other factors including shale sedimentary, pressure and temperature can also alter the pore system and decrease the shale \u201ccaprock\u201d seal efficiency. Similarly, the alteration in shales\u2019 surface chemistry and functional species after CO2 treatment may increase the adsorption capacity of CO2, impacting the overall storage potential in shales. Furthermore, the injection of CO2 into shales may also influence the wetting behavior. Surface wettability is mainly affected by the presented minerals in shale, and less affected by brine salinity, temperature, organic content, and thermal maturity. Mainly, shales have strong water-wetting behavior in the presence of hydrocarbons, however, the alteration in shale\u2019s wettability towards CO2-wet will significantly minimize CO2 storage capacities, and affect the sealing efficiency of caprock. The CO2/shale interactions were also found to cause noticeable degradation in shales\u2019 mechanical properties. CO2 injection can weaken shale, decrease its brittleness and increases its plasticity and toughness. Various reductions in tri-axial compressive strength, tensile strength, and the elastic modulus of shales were observed after CO2 injection, due to the dissolution effect and adsorption strain within the pores. Based on this review, we conclude that CO2/shale interaction is a significant factor for the efficiency of CCS. However, due to the heterogeneity of shales, further studies are needed to include various shale formations and identify how different shales\u2019 mineralogy could affect the CO2 storage capacity in the long-term.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "76de6d00324b46fa8fd487a30d966a4dc3ce78c2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2797578300", "DOI": "10.18520/CS/V114/I07/1430-1437", "CorpusId": 90928205}, "title": "Links between Energy Usage and Climate:Implications on Increasing CO 2 Emissions and Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "Global climate change due to increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere resulting from persistent use of fossil fuels over the past century is one of the major challenges of the contemporary industrial world.

All simulated data can be fitted by the same trend, implying that the characteristic length of the system was dominated by the fracture width. When Ra was high enough, increasing Ra did not reduce the critical time for the onset of instability apparently. Also, it did not increase the maximum peak vertical velocity noticeably. Therefore, there existed asymptotic values for the critical time and maximum peak vertical velocity. With high Ra numbers, the high\u2010frequency oscillation of turbulence greatly enhanced the dissolution of CO2 into brine.

Previous studies have linked rates of lithium ionic conduction with CO2 absorption in similar materials, and in this work we present work aimed at exploring the effect of aliovalent doping on the efficacy of Li2ZrO3 as a CO2 sorbent.

Birkholzer*, Quanlin Zhou Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720 *Corresponding author: jtbirkholzer@lbl.gov, ph. 510 486-7134 Abstract Industrial-scale injection of CO 2 into saline sedimentary basins will cause large-scale fluid pressurization and migration of native brines, which may affect valuable groundwater resources overlying the deep sequestration reservoirs. In this paper, we discuss how such basin-scale hydrologic impacts can (1) affect regulation of CO 2 storage projects and (2) may reduce current storage capacity estimates. Our assessment arises from a hypothetical future carbon sequestration scenario in the Illinois Basin, which involves twenty individual CO 2 storage projects in a core injection area suitable for long- term storage. Each project is assumed to inject five million tonnes of CO 2 per year for 50 years. A regional-scale three-dimensional simulation model was developed for the Illinois Basin that captures both the local-scale CO 2 -brine flow processes and the large- scale groundwater flow patterns in response to CO 2 storage. The far-field pressure buildup predicted for this selected sequestration scenario suggests that (1) the area that needs to be characterized in a permitting process may comprise a very large region within the basin if reservoir pressurization is considered, and (2) permits cannot be granted on a single-site basis alone because the near- and far-field hydrologic response may be affected by interference between individual sites. Our results also support recent studies in that environmental concerns related to near-field and far-field pressure buildup may be a limiting factor on CO 2 storage capacity. In other words, estimates of storage capacity, if solely based on the effective pore volume available for safe trapping of CO 2 , may have to be revised based on assessments of pressure perturbations and their potential impact on caprock integrity and groundwater resources, respectively. We finally discuss some of the challenges in making reliable predictions of large-scale hydrologic impacts related to CO 2 sequestration projects.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "fc9d64010c5a7fba07e89abd024996ba926b6a22", "externalIds": {"MAG": "89569423", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-642-37849-2_1", "CorpusId": 166728392}, "title": "Regulation of Carbon Capture and Storage in China: Lessons from the EU CCS Directive", "abstract": "Is CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) a super hero who successfully deals with the issue of climate change or a dangerous monster who will bring a series of environmental risks and problems?

On one hand, China needs to develop its economy, this means that in the short term, China cannot escape its dependence on fossil fuels; and on the other hand, China is also facing strong international pressure on carbon emission reduction, this means that China will have to abate the use of fossil fuels. However, CCS gives China a new road and a brilliant hope especially in the context of China\u2019s national climate change law which is in the legislative process, although there is no special law to regulate CCS. The legislature should develop a reasonably clear legal framework for CCS to ensure environmental safety and sustainable development.

Often, however, C is considered as a surrogate for energy in studies of detrital decay and C turnover in soil. Bomb calorimetry has long been used to measure stored energy in organic matter, but in detritus not all of the energy is bioavailable. Here I outline an approach to quantify the flux of bioavailable energy dissipated by resident heterotrophic communities in soil organic horizons in situ. I used the principle of energy balance together with a biogeochemical process model parameterized through calorimetric analysis of field samples. I also tested relationships between C and energy across samples of forest detritus (foliar and fine root litter, well-decayed Oea material, and woody debris), across decay stages, and between a deciduous and coniferous forest at the Harvard Forest, MA, USA. As a first approximation, energy and C concentrations were closely related (within ca. 10%), as were ratios of heterotrophic energy dissipation to C mineralization across types of detritus (within 16%). Differences in energy content and energy\u00a0:\u00a0C ratios were measurable in forest detritus (particularly woody vs nonwoody), but did not vary reliably enough between forest types or through detrital stages to indicate that soil C models could be improved by including energetics.

We measure these properties in multiple orientations, including angles oblique to the three principal fracture orientations\u2014Short\u2010transverse, Arrester, and Divider.

Fractures that propagate in a direction oblique or normal to bedding commonly deflect toward the weaker Short\u2010transverse orientation. Such deflected fractures can no longer be considered to propagate in pure mode\u2010I. We therefore present a method to correct measured KIc values to account for deflection by calculating mode\u2010I and mode\u2010II deflection stress intensities (KId and KIId, respectively). Because of the mixed\u2010mode nature of deflected fractures, we adopt a fracture (Gc) energy\u2010based approach that allows analysis of critical fracture propagation conditions for both deflected and undeflected fractures in all orientations. We find that Gc increases as the angle from the Short\u2010transverse plane increases.

However, we think China carries part of the responsibility of global climate change and is capable to offer more. China has been the world\u2019s top emitter since 2007 (2) and will continue to be the leading contributor to global carbon emissions over the next few decades. One can foresee that China can hardly escapeanemissioncapinthefutureasitseconomicdevelopment and citizens\u2019 lifestyles continue to mimic consumption and production patterns of developed countries but with much lower energy intensity levels. However, China would need some time to prepare for the day to come. China committed itself to reduce energy intensity by 20% from 2005 to 2010 in its 11th Five Year Plan (3) and, prior to Copenhagen, has extended its commitment to 40-45% of carbon intensity reduction by 2020 partly achieved through its rapid increase in electricity generation capacities from low-carbon energy sources (e.g., China has doubled installed capacity for wind power annually since 2005). However, China failed to reduce its energy intensity since 2005, but instead had to admit to an increase of 4% prior to 2009, which casts severe doubts on the announced 20% reduction by the end of this year and increases the challenge to achieve the 2020 target. One of the key reasons is that there is no effective market-oriented mechanism in place given the great economic and technological disparities it has within the country. Although the country is not likely to agree to a reduction target in post-2012, a domestic emission \u201ccap and trade\u201d scheme implemented between Chinese regions could potentially help improve energy intensity in all regions and thus lead to an effective reduction of emissions in rich areas and increase efficiency levels for the poor. Furthermore, after \u201cpracticing\u201d such an emission trading scheme at the domestic level, China will be familiar with the mechanism and prepared to join an international carbon trade market in the future. The relative wealthier regions in China such as the coastal provinces usually possess relative advanced production technologies and could effectively be linked with emission caps and trade emission permits with the less developed regions such as the western provinces via a domestic \u201cClean Development Mechanism (CDM)\u201d. This mechanism would stimulate green business investments in the field of wind farms and carbon capture and storage power plants as they would gain extra support in financial and technological terms. Further, it can also accelerate the increase of Chinese research and development investments in low-carbon technologies. While Eastern Chinabecomesasourceofinnovation,WesternChinacanprovide a vast market to absorb and consume such technologies. There were clear signals in Copenhagen that China is seen as less deserving of financial and technological aid from international channels as in the past and more resources should rather be made available for the least developed countries. Hence, within China, the wealthier regions are responsible and capable to play a leading role inhelpingthelessdevelopedregions to leapfrog from a carbon-intensive development path (4). And finally, such a \u201ccap and trade\u201d scheme could potentially help the country in easing off regional economic disparities as well as accelerating the transition to a green economy. Western provinceswouldreceivefinancialandtechnologicalaidtoimprove their economic conditions compared to the richer coastal areas.

Conveniently, hydrogen can be converted back to electricity either via fuel cells or through combustion in gas turbines, or it can be mixed in low concentrations with natural gas or biogas for combustion in existing power plants. The cornerstone of a practical solar fuel production process is a stable, efficient, and scalable photocatalyst (a semiconductor material that accommodates photon absorption, charge carrier generation and transport, and catalytic reactions). Therefore, the quest for suitable photocatalyst materials is an ongoing process. Recently, carbon nitride (CN) has attracted widespread interest as a metal-free, earth-abundant, and highly stable photocatalyst. However, the catalytic efficiency of CN is not satisfactory because of its poor charge transport attributes. There is a direct relation between the photocatalytic efficiency and charge transport because the basic principle of light-promoted overall photodecomposition of water into H2 and O2 molecules (or, generally speaking, photoredox reactions) relies on separation and subsequent transfer of excited-state electron-hole pairs to relative redox couples. However, the excited states last for a very short time, typically nanoseconds to microseconds in liquids, and unless they are separated within this time frame, the excited-state electron-hole pairs undergo recombination with release of the captured light energy as heat or photon emission. To utilize light in a form other than heat or emitted photons by avoiding the recombination of excited-state electron-hole pairs, charged excitons must be scavenged before the absorption of subsequent photons to sustain a multielectron photoredox reaction. Otherwise, the extraction of charges becomes more difficult. This imposes a potential efficiency-limiting factor. An enhancement in water to hydrogen conversion efficiency in CN therefore requires the use of precious-metal cocatalysts (e.g., Pt) and sacrificial electron donor/acceptors to facilitate multielectron/multiproton transfers to overcome the high kinetic barriers. The use of Pt and sacrificial agents is not consistent with the notion of low-cost and sustainable hydrogen production from water. CN must overcome this dependence to stand out as a truly scalable photocatalyst. To make progress, the foremost requirement is to attain an in-depth understanding of the fundamental charge transport phenomena needed for the rational design of CN-based photocatalysts. In this Account, therefore, our aim is to provide a synopsis of current understanding and progress regarding charge-transport-related phenomena (e.g., recombination, trapping, transfer of charge carriers, etc.) and to discuss the effects of charge transport in enhancing the apparent quantum yield of hydrogen production in CN. This understanding is necessary to broaden the scope of CN for other catalytic applications, for example, efficient CO2 reduction to methanol or methane, fixation of nitrogen to ammonia, and use as an active material in solar cells. We also identify research gaps and issues to be addressed for a more clear elucidation of charge-transport-related phenomena in CN. Thus, this Account may inspire new research opportunities for tuning the extrinsic/intrinsic photophysicochemical properties of CN by rational design to attain the most favorable properties for improved catalytic efficiency.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "4b11267744fab1daef15640da3618b09be480d0f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2982823708", "DOI": "10.1504/ijram.2019.103341", "CorpusId": 209789986}, "title": "Potential technical hazards associated with four North American carbon capture and sequestration projects", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) risks depend upon the site geology, potential CO2-caprock reactions, anthropogenic pathways (legacy wellbores), and well construction and operation.

Knowledge of the key reservoir processes and properties that resulted in these observations would help for predicting long-term storage safety and aiding the design of a larger-scale CCS operation at the same site. In this study, we investigate various object-based models and important reservoir parameters to determine aspects of heterogeneity that have the most impact on pressure behavior at the injection well and the observed plume dynamics after injection. Simulation results suggest that the extent of CO2 plume is most sensitive to the geometry of fluvial channels, and specifically, the amount of connected sandbodies that facilitate lateral fluid migration. Along with the injection rate, sandbody permeability plays a significant role in determining pressure near the injection well and in the reservoir. Further work will incorporate the dynamics of CO2 flow down the injection wellbore to derive a more accurate representation of injection rate under the reservoir condition. As drilling and analog data also suggest that fractures may exist in the Liujiagou formation, future work will also construct geomechanical models to investigate the effect of fractures on injection and storage.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "1be7e50ef9de6d9d755ae642654b1bfc6173543f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "206818588", "CorpusId": 107956303}, "title": "A review of hydrogen delivery technologies for energy system models", "abstract": "UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions predominantly result from the combustion of fossil fuels to provide energy services in all sectors of the economy. In the future, it will be necessary to either capture the emissions or to utilise zero-carbon sources of energy. \nHydrogen has been identified as a potential zero-emission energy carrier for the future, primarily for the transport sector but also for energy storage and CHP applications. Although micro-scale hydrogen production systems are being developed for domestic use by some companies, it is likely that a network of hydrogen fuelling stations would be required to supply fuel to motorists or hydrogen-fuelled vehicles would suffer the same range limitations as electric vehicles. Small-scale hydrogen production from electrolysis or biomass would be possible at fuelling stations but large plants would otherwise be required for fossil fuel feedstocks so that the CO2 by-product could be captured and stored using CCS. In the short-term, small-scale SMR could also be deployed at refuelling stations to facilitate the transition to a hydrogen economy but these would not be compatible with decarbonisation in the long-term. Hydrogen production technologies are examined in UKSHEC II Working Paper 6 (Dodds and McDowall, 2012). \nHydrogen is relatively difficult to store and transport in comparison with petroleum fuels. Gaseous hydrogen (GH2) has two principle drawbacks. Firstly, the unusually low volumetric energy density of gaseous hydrogen means that the gas must be compressed to extremely high pressure to be used as a transport fuel. Secondly, the tiny molecules have a higher propensity to leak than other gases and require particularly complex storage materials. One method of avoiding these two difficulties is to compress the hydrogen into a liquid (LH2), but this is energetically-expensive and difficult to handle because LH2 boils at around \u2013253 \u00b0C. Other forms of hydrogen, for example metal hydrides, are currently being researched but are at an early stage of development. \nThree methods are commonly used to deliver hydrogen to refuelling stations (Yang & Ogden 2006). GH2 pipelines require large up-front capital investments but can transport large amounts of hydrogen very cheaply over short and sometimes long distances. The most cost-effective method of delivering small amounts of GH2 over short distances is using gaseous tube trailers. Over longer distances, LH2 delivery by road tanker becomes optimal.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "8839538c99aad849fe0bfbd57a36d859459864a2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3043189762", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.0c01863", "CorpusId": 220521593, "PubMed": "32659082"}, "title": "Design and Validation of Passive Environmental DNA Samplers (PEDS) using Granular Activated Carbon (GAC) and Montmorillonite Clay (MC).", "abstract": "Environmental DNA (eDNA) analysis is gaining prominence as a tool for species and biodiversity monitoring in aquatic environments. eDNA shed by organisms is captured in grab samples, concentrated by filtration, extracted, and analyzed using molecular methods.

Carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (CCS) is a possi-ble GHG mitigating strategy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines a CCS project as a process consisting of three phases: the separation of carbon dioxide from industrial and energy-related sources; transportation of the carbon dioxide to a storage location; and long-term isola-tion of the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This paper focuses on prospects of CCS as CDM projects in general and in the context of Southern Africa. Currently there is no evidence of a long term proven track record of integrated CCS systems; only three industrial scale CCS projects exist global-ly. Nevertheless, new concepts have been proposed for CCS CDM projects such as long-term liability and certified emission reduction (CER) cancellation. However, these concepts are not in the current CDM framework at present. It is thus difficult to prove CCS as an eligible CDM project without first addressing possible expansion and shortfalls of the current CDM structure. More research is also required to quantify the trade offs presented between mitigating carbon dioxide from the atmos-phere at the possible detriment of the areas of stor-age in the Southern Africa context. Only then may CCS projects be deemed more viable in the CDM context. Finally, although the potential for CCS in South Africa has been noted due to major point sources, the cost of capture and storage is a major obstacle; matching point sources and geological storage options is problematic for South Africa and neighbouring countries due to large transport dis-tances. The regulatory risks associated with CCS are further deterrents for the implementation of CCS CDM projects in Southern Africa in the near future.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "9cdc8f8b761a811ad110cc4af6cf4d0f044dc0d3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2063639669", "DOI": "10.1002/ppsc.201200116", "CorpusId": 98573879}, "title": "Creation of Transparent Nanocomposite Films with a Refractive Index of 2.3 Using Polymerizable Silicon Nanoparticles", "abstract": "DOI: 10.1002/ppsc.201200116 Fabrication of nanocomposites by embedding inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) into polymer matrices has captured tremendous interests owing to the enhanced performances beyond individual NPs and polymers.

The combined weight of these challenges needs to be clarified in terms of the energy system and macroeconomic impacts. We applied a general equilibrium energy economic model to assess these impacts on an 80% emission reduction target by 2050 considering several alternative scenarios for nuclear power deployment, technology availability, end use energy efficiency, and the price of fossil fuels. We found that achieving the mitigation target was feasible for all scenarios, with considerable reductions in total energy consumption (39%\u201350%), higher shares of low-carbon sources (43%\u201372% compared to 15%), and larger shares of electricity in the final energy supply (51%\u201358% compared to 42%). The economic impacts of limiting nuclear power by 2050 (3.5% GDP loss) were small compared to the lack of carbon capture and storage (CCS) (6.4% GDP loss). Mitigation scenarios led to an improvement in energy security indicators (trade dependency and diversity of primary energy sources) even in the absence of nuclear power. Moreover, preliminary analysis indicates that expanding the range of renewable energy resources can lower the macroeconomic impacts of the long term target considerably, and thus further in depth analysis is needed on this aspect. Key policy insights For Japan, an emissions reduction target of 80% by 2050 is feasible without nuclear power or CCS. The macroeconomic impact of such a 2050 target was largest without CCS, and smallest without nuclear power.

We show that redistribution is challenging due to large economic disincentives required to shift production, and offers limited economic benefit for developing countries given the long timeframe required to effect change, and the wider impact of rising fuel import and energy systems costs. Furthermore, increases in production shares are offset by shrinking markets for fossil fuels, which are part dependent on carbon capture and storage (CCS). We argue that while there is a weak economic case for redistribution, there is a clear role for equity principles in guiding the development of supply side policy and in development assistance.

The capture of CO2 has been difficult due to its extremely high stability. In this study, we propose a simple and yet effective approach for capture and storage of CO2 by C6Li6. C6Li6 possesses a planar star-like structure, whose ionization energy is lower than that of Li atom and hence, it behaves as a superalkali. Superalkalis are unusual species possessing lower ionization energies than alkali atoms. We have systematically studied the interaction of successive CO2 molecules with C6Li6 using long-range dispersion corrected density functional {\\omega}B97xD/6-311+G(d) calculations. We notice that these interactions lead to stable C6Li6-nCO2 complexes (n = 1-6) in which the structure of CO2 moieties is bent appreciably (122-125deg) due to electron transfer from C6Li6, whose planarity is distorted only slightly (less than or equal to 7 deg). This clearly suggests that the CO2 molecules can successfully be activated and captured by C6Li6. We have also analyzed bond-lengths and bond-angle of CO2, their charges and adsorption energy as a function of the number of adsorbed CO2 (n). It has been also noticed that the bond-length of CO2 in C6Li6-nCO2 complexes increases monotonically whereas adsorption energy decreases, ranging 3.18-2.79 eV per CO2 with the increase in n.

Fixed C may be partitioned among biomolecules within the leaf and/or allocated throughout the tree to growth, storage and maintenance activities. Phosphorus (P) availability often limits tree productivity due to its high biological demand and strong interactions with soil minerals. As ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi play critical roles in enhancing phosphate (Pi) acquisition by their hosts, these symbioses will influence the fate of C within trees and forested ecosystems. Using Populus tremuloides Michx. (trembling aspen) in symbiosis with Laccaria bicolor (Marie) P.D. Orton or Paxillus involutus (Batsch) Fr., we assessed C acquisition, allocation and partitioning under Pi limitation, specifically focusing on primary and secondary C compounds. Both ECM fungi moderated the effects of low P on photosynthesis and C partitioning among carbohydrates and secondary metabolites by sustaining Pi uptake and translocation in P. tremuloides under Pi limitation. As leaf P declined, reductions in photosynthesis were accompanied by significant shifts in C partitioning from nonstructural carbohydrates (NSCs) to phenolic glycosides and tannins. Carbon partitioning in roots exhibited more complex patterns, with distinct increases in NSCs in nonmycorrhizal (NM) plants under Pi limitation that were not evident in plants colonized by either ECM symbiont. In general, aspen colonized by L. bicolor exhibited C partitioning patterns intermediate between those of NM and P. involutus aspen. The C cost of symbiosis was pronounced for plants supporting P. involutus, where ECM plants exhibited maintenance of photosynthesis yet reduced biomass in comparison with NM and L. bicolor aspen under Pi replete conditions. Our results indicate that the ECM symbiosis affects the disposition of C in forest trees in part by altering the acquisition of other limiting resources from soils, but also through ECM species-specific influences on host physiology.

The development of low-emission fossil fuel technologies combined with the carbon capture and storage (CCS) system has been proposed to reduce the adversities of climate change caused by the emission of greenhouse gases particularly CO2. Gas separation in this process could be accomplished by either chemical solvent technology or membrane technology. In spite of its popularity, the chemical solvent technology has certain limitations such as expensive operational cost, high heat reaction with CO2, and corrosive nature of some solvents [2]. In contrast, gas separation using membrane technology provides good benefits such as energy efficiency, utilization of non-toxic chemical, and simple operating procedure that makes it extremely attractive for CO2 capture [3]. In terms of energy requirements, membrane technology was comparable for the adsorption of flue gases containing 20% or more of CO2 [4]. Numerous studies have shown the economical benefits of membrane based separation system for a high concentration of CO2 [5]. In fact, the polymeric membranes have several limitations for gas separation such as low selectivity, high temperature instability, swelling and decomposition in organic solvents [6].

Although the properties of some inorganic materials are well above the trade-off curve for polymers, it is challenging to duplicate the enlarge-scale modules containing thousands of square meters of membrane areas due to the expensive of the capital cost.

Malaysia is a fast developing economy with a historical trend of high reliance on fossil fuel for its energy needs.

This chapter reviews the necessary physical climate science to understand the role of CCS in limiting warming. We describe how the concept of a finite \u201ccarbon budget\u201d arises out of interactions between the carbon-cycle and the rest of the climate system. A clear physically-based requirement for achieving the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement is the necessity of reaching global net-zero carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. Based on this insight, we undertake a high-level but informative decomposition of Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) emissions reduction scenarios into contributions arising from the substitution of demand for carbon dioxide, and from the sequestration of carbon dioxide. In all scenarios that allow for the availability of CCS, the cost-effective solution offsets 20% or greater of business-as-usual end-of-century CO2 emissions with CCS and/or negative emissions technologies. We highlight the need for the sequestered fraction of extracted carbon, a potentially useful climate policy measure, to rise to reach unity in order to limit warming to any value and describe a near-term schedule for increases in this fraction compatible with IAM-simulated cost-effective pathways that succeed in meeting the Paris Agreement long-term temperature goal.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "4097642e9379ec22457c4605027b636cb8d17f67", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2114361008", "CorpusId": 140714261}, "title": "\u00bfC\u00f3mo fijar carbono atmosf\u00e9rico, certificarlo y venderlo para complementar los ingresos de productores ind\u00edgenas en Costa Rica?", "abstract": "Farmers in the tropics can accumulate carbon in the wood of several woody perennials that grow in their farms, join the global carbon market, bring additional income to the farm economy and conserve the environment.

To date, the reservoir fluids of principle concern to rock physics community have been hydrocarbon fluids (oils and gasses) and brine. It is now apparent that a better understanding of CO 2 is of paramount importance. CO 2 Properties It is well known that CO 2 is not a simple fluid. Whilst gaseous (~2kg/m 3 ) at surface temperatures and pressures, it exhibits supercritical (sc) behaviour beyond 7.4MPa and 31\u00b0C (464kg/m 3 ) which correspond to approximately 840 m depth at a normal onshore geothermal gradient of 25\u00b0C/km. At that geothermal gradient a liquid phase of CO 2 (680-690 kg/m 3 ) may precede the supercritical phase transition. In the reservoir column, CO 2 could vary in density by almost three orders of magnitude and be in all four fluid states (vapour, gas, liquid and super critical (scCO 2). In addition to this, CO 2 is a non-polar compound and thus has no intermolecular interactions when pure. However, when mixing with polar molecules such as water/brine a quadrupole is induced on the CO 2 molecule [1]. This will affect the behaviour (viscosity, supercritical point etc) of the CO 2 fluid according to the molecules with which it\u2019s interacting.

We find that while all the NGOs are committed to combating climate change, their views on CCS as a mitigation strategy vary considerably.

Energy intensive industry is uniquely restricted in the way it uses energy and emits greenhouse gasses. In this thesis, the potential of radical measures to achieve significant energy demand reduction and emissions abatement in UK energy intensive industry is assessed. Adopted is a multidisciplinary approach combining thermodynamic and techno-economic analysis techniques. Bottom-up assessments are applied to key energy intensive sectors of industry to capture the diverse and interactive array of technological characteristics invisible from a top-down perspective. Detailed projection models are built to design and analyse technology roadmaps for the sectors out to 2050. In an illustrative roadmap assessment, the technological pathways of radical process transition and carbon sequestration were each shown to achieve about 80% abatement in 2050 from 1990 emissions levels. Radical process transition achieved greater abatement before 2030 and this was reflected in lower cumulative emissions over the full period. Higher risk is associated with carbon sequestration from its reliance on timely access to CO2 transport and storage technology to compensate for lower short-medium term abatement. Although, combining carbon sequestration with high levels of biomass combustion indicated the largest potential abatement to 2050. Abatement economics in the iron and steel sector are notably sensitive to resource costs and the carbon trading price. The carbon trading price influences relative production costs in favour of higher abating pathways, but increases absolute costs. This signals the need for supportive policy measures that accelerate technology development and deployment while mitigating the risk of the carbon trading price to competitiveness. Some carbon capture technologies reduce relative production cost even in the absence of a carbon price, but this excludes the cost of CO2 transport and storage. Meanwhile, radical process transition pathways have a higher dependence on the future prices of natural gas, electricity, and scrap. Future work should focus on expanding the economic appraisal to other sectors and to indirect costs, as well as incorporating wider material efficiency strategies and running different future scenarios.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "5c2a71d4dc26b8c2f31a9146be46c4ab9b97d509", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2182072412", "CorpusId": 131235392}, "title": "Review Paper (SS-1) BIOTIC AND ABIOTIC PROCESSES AS A CARBON SEQUESTRATION STRATEGY", "abstract": "Globally major concern is increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as its dominating impact on climate change.

Disposing of the carbon dioxide (CO2) into long-lived pools (terrestrial biosphere, underground, or ocean) and storing it securely so it is not immediately reemitted is referred as carbon sequestration. Biotic C sequestration involves capture of atmospheric C through photosynthesis and storage in biota, soil and wetlands. Land use, vegetation and soil management have a strong impact on the biotic processes of C sequestration. In geological formations, sequestration of CO2 is possible in oil and coal gas reservoirs for storage and enhancing the recovery but maximum possibility of storage is in deep saline aquifers. Ocean is the largest potential sink for CO2, ocean fertilization and deeper injections is more efficient than shallower ones. Mineral sequestration is the safest way of carbon sequestration with the limitation that process is very slow and takes thousands of years. Understanding the C sequestration process in view of cost would help in better agricultural land use and management practices.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "f74a62bdbeb04f2095889e495344fb63a2ae749a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2789375194", "DOI": "10.1007/s10973-018-7207-x", "CorpusId": 102900960}, "title": "Characterization analysis of raw and pyrolyzed plane tree seed (Platanus orientalis L.) samples for its application in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology", "abstract": "Abstract\nRaw and pyrolyzed samples of the plane tree seeds (PTS) were tested by various advanced analytical techniques including simultaneous TG-DSC technique, FTIR analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, Raman spectroscopy analysis, GC\u2013MS (gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry) analysis and scanning electron microscope analysis, for its characterization procedure and the pre-treatments in possible application in CCS. Nondestructive analytical method (XRD) showed that raw material is typical for carbon-rich material, where was identified increase in interlayer spacing within graphite structure. The XRD results of pyrolyzed sample at 850\u00a0\u00b0C showed a sudden loss in interlayer spacing. Spectroscopic analyses of pyrolyzed sample demonstrated the presence of typical aromatic structures found in amorphous carbon. Results indicate the high levels of the growth in basal planes of graphite structure in pyrolyzed sample. It was established that integrated reaction model parameters for pyrolysis of untreated PTS sample realistically describe active temperature period required for charcoal forming, under non-isothermal conditions. It was found that mechanical treatment of material results in increase in the number of chemical compounds. Micrograph showed the presence of variety of shapes and structures, where after pyrolysis, some dissipated pores were detected. One of these pores was partially blocked in some places, depending on the size of surface area. The results showed that the resulting char has very good features for further activation process, while the PTS would represent a good candidate in its application in the CCS.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "a7bc9f035a62e248296d7bbd0092ca19787d74dc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2802767211", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/AABCD7", "CorpusId": 158910912}, "title": "Constraints on biomass energy deployment in mitigation pathways: the case of water scarcity", "abstract": "To limit global warming to well below 2 \u00b0 most of the IPCC-WGIII future stringent mitigation pathways feature a massive global-scale deployment of negative emissions technologies (NETs) before the end of the century. The global-scale deployment of NETs like Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) can be hampered by climate constraints that are not taken into account by Integrated assessment models (IAMs) used to produce those pathways. Among the various climate constraints, water scarcity appears as a potential bottleneck for future land-based mitigation strategies and remains largely unexplored. Here, we assess climate constraints relative to water scarcity in response to the global deployment of BECCS. To this end, we confront results from an Earth system model (ESM) and an IAM under an array of 25 stringent mitigation pathways. These pathways are compatible with the Paris Agreement long-term temperature goal and with cumulative carbon emissions ranging from 230 Pg C and 300 Pg C from January 1st onwards. We show that all stylized mitigation pathways studied in this work limit warming below 2 \u00b0C or even 1.5 \u00b0C by 2100 but all exhibit a temperature overshoot exceeding 2 \u00b0C after 2050. According to the IAM, a subset of 17 emission pathways are feasible when evaluated in terms of socio-economic and technological constraints. The ESM however shows that water scarcity would limit the deployment of BECCS in all the mitigation pathways assessed in this work. Our findings suggest that the evolution of the water resources under climate change can exert a significant constraint on BECCS deployment before 2050. In 2100, the BECCS water needs could represent more than 30% of the total precipitation in several regions like Europe or Asia.", "year": 2018}]}
