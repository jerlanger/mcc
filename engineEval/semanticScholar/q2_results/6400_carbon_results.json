Carbon capture and storage technology (CCS) is the only technology that can mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel fired power by selectively capturing CO2 from flue gases. High capital and high operational costs of this process are the major obstacles of industrial implementation. In the field of CCS the chemical absorption process is the most mature technology. The use of kinetic rate promoters that enhance the mass transfer of CO2 with slow-capturing but energetically favorable solvents can open up a variety of new process options for this technology. The ubiquitous enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA), which enhances the mass transfer of CO2 in the lungs by catalyzing the reversible hydration of CO2, is one very promising mass transfer rate promoter for CCS. This process has been previously been tested successfully in lab scale and in some rare cases in pilot scale, but no validated process model for this technology has been published yet. This PhD thesis presents an investigation of the feasibility of enzyme enhanced CO2 capture technology by identifying the potentials and limitations in lab and in pilot scale and benchmarking the process against proven technologies. The main goal was to derive a realistic process model for technical size absorbers with a wide range of validity incorporating a mechanistic enzyme kinetic model and validating it against in-house pilot plant experiments. The work consisted of identifying a suitable enzyme-solvent system and the ideal process conditions by comparing mass transfer rates of different solvents and enzyme enhanced solvents in a lab scale wetted wall column. A kinetic model for the mechanistic enzyme reactions was developed for MDEA (Nmethyl-diethanolamine) solutions capable of describing the mass transfer of CO2 for absorption and desorption. It incorporates the influence of all relevant process conditions for technical absorbers, such as: temperature, solvent concentration, enzyme concentration, CO2 concentration in the gas and liquid phase, as well as bicarbonate concentration in the liquid phase. The process with enzyme enhanced MDEA was scaled up, and absorption experiments were carried out on a 10 m high pilot absorber column. The influence of enzyme concentration, column height, as well as solvent flow rates were determined for 30 wt% MDEA in over 50 runs and compared to over 30 pilot plant runs with the industrial standard solvent 30 wt% MEA (monoethanolamine) under the same process conditions. The mass transfer performance of enzyme enhanced solutions was found to be close to the industrial standard. The pilot plant experiments could be accurately predicted with the in-house absorber column model CAPCO2 after the kinetic enzyme model from the lab experiments was implemented. The model can very accurately simulate the influence of each process parameter tested. For targeting the thermal stability of the enzyme in desorption, an alternative low temperature process without reboiler was presented. A stripping gas carrier is utilized in this process to avoid thermal deactivation of the enzymes in the solvent regeneration; its technical feasibility was successfully tested in pilot scale desorption experiments. The experiments at lab and pilot scale have clearly proven CA\u2019s potential in CCS. The presented validated absorber column model together with the low temperature regeneration process can be used to simulate and optimize the enzyme enhanced CO2 capture process and benchmark this novel technology against conventional processes.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "6ecb311dc2f7db927aa463cde1b3f54619628bbb", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1051/e3sconf/202132901018", "CorpusId": 245053976}, "title": "The Progress of Offshore CO2 Capture and Storage", "abstract": "With the development of the offshore oil and gas fields, more and more offshore oil and gas fields are found to have high carbon dioxide.

It is shown that when uncertainty is integrated in the economic analysis, CO2 and oil price threshold levels at which investments in CO2 capture and enhanced oil recovery will take place, are higher than when a net present value approach is adopted. We also demonstrate that a tax on CO2 instead of an emission trading system results in a lower investment threshold level for the investment in the CO2 capture unit. Furthermore, we determine a minimum CO2 selling price between the two firms and show that CO2-EOR has the potential to pull CCS into the market by providing an additional revenue on the capture plant.

The scientific and the societal uncertainties in the climate change policies must be the large part of this barrier. Following the Paris Agreement, the world comes to the next stage to decide the next actions. Without a view of risk management, any decision will be \u201cbased on neglecting alternatives\u201d behavior. The Ministry of the Environment, Japan has established an inter-disciplinary research project, called Integrated Climate Assessment\u2014Risks, Uncertainties, and Society (ICA-RUS) conducted by Dr. Seita Emori, National Institute for Environmental Studies. ICA-RUS consists of five research themes, i.e., (1) synthesis of global climate risks, (2) optimization of land, water, and ecosystem for climate risks, (3) analysis of critical climate risks, (4) evaluation of climate risk management options, and (5) interactions between scientific and social rationalities. We participated in the fourth theme to provide the quantitative assessment of technology options and policy measures by integrating assessment model simulations. We employ the multi-model approach to deal with the complex relationships among various fields such as technology, economics, and land use changes. Four different types of integrated assessment models, i.e., MARIA-14 (Mori), EMEDA (Washida), GRAPE (Kurosawa), and AIM (Masui), participate in the fourth research theme. These models contribute to the ICA-RUS by providing two information categories. First, these models provide common simulation results based on shared socioeconomic pathway scenarios and the shared climate policy cases given by the first theme of ICA-RUS to see the ranges of the evaluation. Second, each model also provides model-specific outcomes to answer special topics, e.g., geoengineering, sectoral trade, adaptation, and decision making under uncertainties. The purpose of this paper is to describe the outline and the main outcomes of the multi-model inter-comparison among the four models with a focus upon the first and to present the main outcomes. Furthermore, in this study, we introduce a statistical meta-analysis of the multi-model simulation results to see whether the differently structured models provide the inter-consistent findings. The major findings of our activities are as follows: First, in the stringent climate target, the regional economic losses among models tend to diverge, whereas global total economic loss does not. Second, both carbon capture and storage (CCS) as well as BECCS are essential for providing the feasibility of stringent climate targets even if the deployment potential varies among models. Third, the models show small changes in the crop production in world total, whereas large differences appear between regions. Fourth, the statistical meta-analysis of the multi-model simulation results suggests that the models would have an implicit but common relationship between gross domestic product losses and mitigation options even if their structures and simulation results are different. Since this study is no more than a preliminary exercise of the statistical meta-analysis, it is expected that more sophisticated methods such as data mining or machine learning could be applicable to the simulation database to extract the implicit information behind the models.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "2d760766d9c4c7c8edb42daa50ad182e069195e2", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 46922197}, "title": "The Feasibility of Implementing Carbon Capture and Storage at Yale", "abstract": "This senior thesis examines the feasibility and cost of implementing capture and storage of the carbon dioxide (CO2) that is currently released to the atmosphere by the power plants providing most of the electricity, heating and cooling on the Yale University main campus. The two facilities are Yale Central Power Plant and Yale Sterling Power Plant. After a review of the background and current state of carbon capture and storage as a technology for mitigating climate change, the paper uses the Yale plants as examples for a calculation of the costs associated with all phases of this process, including capturing CO2 from the flue gas, compressing it to a supercritical fluid, transporting the fluid to a storage site, and injecting it into an underground geologic formation. To estimate transportation and storage costs, we consider storage in the Mt. Simon Sandstone Formation in the Illinois Basin. The Mt. Simon formation is one of the closest underground injection sites that have been proposed and studied for safe, long-term storage of captured carbon in deep saline aquifers (Breunig et al., 2012). No similar sites in the Northeastern United States have been as extensively studied. Finally, I estimate the monetary and energy costs of the full cycle of CCS. However, a recent research project at Yale looked at the feasibility of injecting CO2 into basaltic rocks, which are abundant in the Northeast, in a type of carbon sequestration called mineral carbonation. This process converts the injected fluid CO2 into solid minerals by reaction with other minerals in the host rock, and can be considered a truly permanent form of sequestration. As part of the work in this thesis, I developed a simple reaction model to try to better understand the results of the laboratory studies of carbonation reactions with the mineral olivine, which were carried out on Yale West Campus from 2011 to 2016 in a project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (Wang et al., 2016). Background In 2015, fossil fuels made up 81.5% of total U.S. energy consumption and about 80.1% of the world\u2019s total energy consumption (IEA, 2016). With abundant supplies still available (BP, 2016), fossil fuels are projected to remain the Figure 1: US energy consumption in 2015 dominant source of energy through at least the first half of the 21st century. Fossil fuels still have many advantages over renewables forms of energy, including relatively low cost, high energy density, existing infrastructure, and ease of use and storage. Fossil fuels have afforded many countries with high standard of living. The benefits of fossil fuels must, however, be critically weighed with the costs associated with the greenhouse gases and pollutants that they emit. These emissions have adverse environmental, economic, and human health effects, including the effects of anthropogenic climate change. The most important greenhouse gas in Earth\u2019s atmosphere is carbon dioxide (CO2). And, the major source of anthropogenic CO2 is combustion of fossil fuels. A transition to low-carbon energy throughout the world will likely require decades, and perhaps even centuries, to unfold. Given that existing fossil fuel power plants provide 65% of the total generated power in the US, any reasonable strategy for mitigating anthropogenic climate change must incorporate technologies that cut greenhouse gas emissions without shutting down these plants (IPCC, 2014). Technological solutions and mitigation strategies are necessary to reduce the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and ultimately combat climate change. The International Energy Agency projects that international 14% reduction of CO2 emissions in 2050 will be through application of CCS technology (IEA, 2016). CCS in The Context of International Climate Agreement to Achieve A 2\u00b0C Scenario The Paris Agreement represents a clear commitment from the world\u2019s political leaders to transition to a low-carbon economy. The agreement focuses on climate mitigation strategies after 2020. Achieving the ambitious goals of the Paris Agreement necessitates implementation of CCS among other climate mitigation actions. The new approach adopted for the post-2020 climate agreement has evolved since the pre-2020 agreement under the Kyoto Protocol and incorporates a \u201cbottom-up\u201d approach expected to secure a greater level of climate action through intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs). The Paris Agreement defines a number of ambitious climate goals. A short-term goal is reaching peak emissions as soon as possible. Article 2 defines goals for \u201cholding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial times and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change\u201d (Paris Agreement, 2015). Global modelling efforts by the IPCC and the IEA underscore CCS as a critically important mitigation technology that can help countries meet the level of global emissions reduction goals set by the Paris Agreement. The IPCC Climate Change 2014: Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers compared the costs of achieving 450 parts per million (ppm) CO2 equivalents by 2100 with scenarios that include CCS, and concluded that the cost without CCS would be 138% more costly and that only a minority of climate model runs could successfully produce a 450 ppm without CCS (IPCC, 2014). Since climate models indicate that the 450 ppm atmospheric concentration threshold will likely be exceeded in the absence of CCS, there will be a stressed need for even more net-negative mitigation climate action in the post-2050 period. Netnegative technologies, such as bio-energy coupled with CCS (BECCS) face even more obstacles to large-scale deployment. Given the political uncertainty regarding the EPA and President Trump\u2019s willingness to adhere to the Paris Climate Agreement, there are still questions surrounding the United States\u2019 commitment to climate action. Given the likelihood of a carbon budget overshoot, especially for a \u201cwell below a 2\u00b0C target\u201d, research and development in CCS technologies should be prioritized among climate mitigation technologies. Achieving the goals of the 2\u00b0C Scenario will be very challenging. Substantially curbing emissions is necessary to address the rapid rise in average global temperature from current greenhouse gas emissions, as well as \u201cwarming in the pipeline.\u201d The global emissions from the energy sector in 2016 was 32.1 gigatonnes of CO2 (IEA Newsroom, 2017). IEA projections for a least-cost pathway to reach a 2\u00b0C Scenario would need capture and storage of approximately 4,000 million tonnes of CO2 per year in 2040. This would be 100 times the expected annual CO2 capture capacity by the end of 2017 (IEA, 2016). Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the only current technology that can deliver significant emissions reduction from anthropogenic greenhouse gas sources. CCS can reduce emissions from industrial sectors such as cement manufacturing, petrochemical, iron and steel, and refining. Based on emissions reduction models by the International Energy Agency, CCS could deliver 13% of the cumulative emission reductions needed by 2050 to limit the global temperature increase", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "391bd27f3dbbe7ec6cbcfbf0b57ec0b65b708c36", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.5194/esd-2021-72", "CorpusId": 237639284}, "title": "Impact of bioenergy crops expansion on climate-carbon cycle feedbacks in overshoot scenarios", "abstract": "Abstract. Stringent mitigation pathways frame the deployment of second-generation bioenergy crops combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) to generate negative CO2 emissions. This Bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) technology facilitates the achievement of the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. Here, we use five state-of-the-art Earth System models (ESMs) to explore the consequences of large-scale BECCS deployment on the carbon cycle and carbon-climate feedback under the CMIP6 SSP5-3.4-OS overshoot scenario, keeping in mind that all these models use generic crop vegetation to simulate BECCS crops. We show that an extensive cropland expansion for BECCS causes ecosystem carbon loss that drives the acceleration of carbon turnover and affects the estimates of the absolute values of the global carbon-concentration \u03b2 and carbon-climate \u03b3 feedback parameters. Both parameters decrease so that global \u03b2 becomes less positive, and \u03b3 \u2013 more negative. Over the 2000\u20132100 period, the land-use change (LUC) for BECCS leads to an offset of the \u03b2-driven carbon uptake by 12.2\u2009% and amplifies the \u03b3-driven carbon loss by 14.6\u2009%. A human choice on land area allocation for energy crops should take into account not only the potential amount of the bioenergy yield but also the LUC emissions, and the associated loss of future potential change in the carbon uptake via the \u03b2 and \u03b3 feedbacks. The dependency of the estimates of \u03b2 and \u03b3 on LUC is very strong after the middle of the 21st century in the SSP5-3.4-OS scenario but it also affects other SSP scenarios and should be taken into account by the integrated assessment modelling teams and accounted for in mitigation policies so as to limit the reductions of the CO2 fertilization effect where BECCS or land use expansion of short vegetation is applied.\n", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "9a2ddf7057c5a4fc204478010656f958bb3f7cf4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2092243011", "DOI": "10.1109/OCEANS-YEOSU.2012.6263443", "CorpusId": 25539521}, "title": "An experimental and numerical study on transient behavior in the CO2 pipeline transportation", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology is regarded as one of the most promising emission reduction options for the mitigation of climate change.

The diversity of cyanobacteria was investigated using taxonomic cell counts and shotgun metagenomics over two seasons in a drinking water treatment plant before, during, and after the bloom. Changes in the community structure over time at the phylum, genus, and species levels were monitored in samples retrieved from raw water (RW), sludge in the holding tank (ST), and sludge supernatant (SST). Aphanothece clathrata brevis, Microcystis aeruginosa, Dolichospermum spiroides, and Chroococcus minimus were predominant species detected in RW by taxonomic cell counts. Shotgun metagenomics revealed that Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in RW before and after the cyanobacterial bloom. Taxonomic cell counts and shotgun metagenomic showed that the Dolichospermum bloom occurred inside the plant. Cyanobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the major bacterial phyla during the bloom. Shotgun metagenomics also showed that Synechococcus, Microcystis, and Dolichospermum were the predominant detected cyanobacterial genera in the samples. Conventional treatment removed more than 92% of cyanobacterial cells but led to cell accumulation in the sludge up to 31 times more than in the RW influx. Coagulation/sedimentation selectively removed more than 96% of Microcystis and Dolichospermum. Cyanobacterial community in the sludge varied from raw water to sludge during sludge storage (1\u201313 days). This variation was due to the selective removal of coagulation/sedimentation as well as the accumulation of captured cells over the period of storage time. However, the prediction of the cyanobacterial community composition in the SST remained a challenge. Among nutrient parameters, orthophosphate availability was related to community profile in RW samples, whereas communities in ST were influenced by total nitrogen, Kjeldahl nitrogen (N- Kjeldahl), total and particulate phosphorous, and total organic carbon (TOC).

On the one hand, CDR is recognised as a crucial technical option to offset residual carbon emissions from fossil fuel use, so that it can help a transition to the net-zero energy system. But on the other hand, a serious concern is raised about CDR as a way to circumvent necessary emissions reduction, hence perpetuating the status quo of fossil fuel use. This apparent paradox of CDR, however, has less to do with technology itself but more with the difficulty to move away from carbon lock-in\u2014the deeply entrenched fossil-fuel-based energy system. The challenge of decarbonisation is indeed about eroding the deep lock-ins that perpetuate the production and consumption of fossil fuels. To understand the role of CDR in overcoming carbon lock-in, looking back the past debate on carbon capture and storage (CCS) is instructive. Although both CCS and CDR are criticised for keeping the fossil status quo, there is a crucial difference between them. Unlike CCS, CDR can possibly avoid the risk of reinforced lock-in, given its physical decoupling from fossil fuel use. And yet CDR has the risk of undue substitution that continues unjustly fossil carbon emissions. A change of the framing question is thus needed to puzzle out the paradox of CDR. To rightly place CDR in the challenge of rapid decarbonisation, we should ask more how CDR technologies can be used in alignment with a managed decline to fossil fuel production.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "ec3a20295391dcfd831af16db7eac876520a9068", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2941516713", "CorpusId": 149533686}, "title": "Capture and Storage of Carbon Dioxide (CaSCaDe)", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "63b60f7e16c8c368fe96358ae28002db46547b5e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2992394591", "CorpusId": 217167108}, "title": "Carbon dioxide storage cement composition using carbon dioxide collecting by-product and manufacturing method thereof", "abstract": "The present invention relates to a cement composition and a production method thereof.

Two methods that show the most promise are Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR) and Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS). In Enhanced Gas Recovery a depleted or depleting natural gas reservoir is re-energized with high pressure CO2 to increase the recovery factor of the gas. As an additional benefit following the extraction of natural gas, the reservoir would serve as a long-term storage vessel for the captured carbon. CO2 based Enhanced Geothermal Systems seek to increase the heat extracted from a given geothermal reservoir by using CO2 as a working fluid. Carbon sequestration is accomplished as a result of fluid losses throughout the life of the geothermal system. Although these technologies are encouraging approaches to help in the mitigation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions, the detailed mechanisms involved are not fully understood. There remain uncertainties in the efficiency of the systems over time, and the safety of the sequestered CO2 due to leakage. In addition, the efficiency of both natural gas extraction in x EGR and heat extraction in EGS are highly dependent on the injection rate and injection pressure. Before large scale deployment of these technologies, it is important to maximize the extraction efficiency and sequestration capacity by optimizing the injection parameters. In this thesis, numerical simulations of subsurface flow in EGR and EGS are conducted using the DOE multiphase flow solver TOUGH2 (Transport of Unsaturated Groundwater and Heat). A previously developed multi-objective optimization code based on a genetic algorithm is modified for applications to EGR and EGS. For EGR study, a model problem based on a benchmark-study that compares various mathematical and numerical models for CO2 storage is considered. For EGS study a model problem based on previous studies (with parameters corresponding to the European EGS site at Soultz) is considered. The simulation results compare well with the computations of other investigators and give insight into the parameters that can influence the simulation accuracy. Optimizations for EGR and EGS problems are carried out with a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimizer combined with TOUGH2, designated as GA-TOUGH2. Validation of the optimizer was achieved by comparison of GA based optimization studies with the brute-force run of large number of simulations. Using GA-TOUGH2, optimal time-independent and time-dependent injection profiles were determined for both EGR and EGS. Optimization of EGR problem resulted in a larger natural gas production rate, a shorter total operation time, and an injection pressure well below the fracture pressure. Optimization of EGS problem resulted in a precise management of the production temperature profile, heat extraction for the entire well life, and more efficient utilization of CO2. The results of these studies will hopefully pave the way for future GA-TOUGH2 based optimization studies to improve the modeling of CCUS projects.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "5dca8d5e0f751c9f6949b88b8da3e33ea4c7c0ad", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2385367383", "CorpusId": 156352362}, "title": "Effective Way to Address Climate Change:Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide(CO2) capture and storage(CCS) technology is seen as one of the most promising solutions to climate changes.The CCS technology includes three aspects: CO2 capture,transport and storage.Firstly,this paper introduces the CO2 capture technology,which can be categorized into pre-combustion capture,enriched oxygen combustion capture and post-combustion capture.Then the paper introduces the CO2 storage technology,which can be categorized into geology storage and ocean storage according to storage site.Among the many CO2 storage technologies,because of high economic benefits,CO2 enhanced oil recovery(CO2-EOR) technology has been widely used in recent years.Although the CCS technology has developed rapidly,there are still many problems,such as the CO2 leak and high investment.However,as governments increasingly attach importance to research and development of the CCS technology,it will play an important role in resisting global warming in the future.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "fa88f055178287fd80b2a3dbb25cc59ead73c5e7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2089575322", "DOI": "10.1021/JP076409T", "CorpusId": 97291516}, "title": "Preparation of Nanoporous Carbon Particles and Their Cryogenic Hydrogen Storage Capacities", "abstract": "Spherical nanoporous carbon particles were synthesized from carbon precursor solutions of sucrose with either silica sols or colloidal silica particles, or both, in a direct one-step aerosol-assisted process followed by carbonization and then removal of the silica template.

PSA is, due to its low operational cost and its ability to efficiently separate CO2 from flue gas, a promising candidate for post-combustion carbon capture in power plants, which is an important link in the Carbon Capture and Storage technology chain. PSA offers many design possibilities, but to optimise the performance of a PSA system over a wide range of design choices, by experimental means, is typically too costly, in terms of time and resources required. To address this challenge, computer experiments are used to emulate the real system and to predict the performance. The system of PDAEs that describes the PSA process behaviour is however typically computationally expensive to simulate, especially as the cyclic steady state condition has to be met. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in computational strategies for PSA design, but more efficient optimisation procedures are needed. One popular class of optimisation methods are the Evolutionary algorithms (EAs). EAs are however less efficient for computationally expensive models. The use of surrogate models in optimisation is an exciting research direction that allows the strengths of EAs to be used for expensive models. A surrogate based optimisation (SBO) procedure is here developed for the design of PSA systems. The procedure is applicable for constrained and multi-objective optimisation. This SBO procedure relies on Kriging, a popular surrogate model, and is used with EAs. The main application of this work is the design of PSA systems for CO2 capture.

Together with increasing quantities of consumption, there are growing constraints on water availability. In our future there will be two elements of consumption at the forefront of concern: availability and efficiency. Availability of freshwater is the most important of these and is the subject of this report. To use water efficiently, we must first have it. Efficiency is key to ensuring availability for future needs. As population grows and economic and technology demands increase - especially for thermoelectric power - needs for freshwater will also increase. Thus, using our limited supplies of freshwater must be done as efficiently as possible. Thermoelectric generating industry is the largest user of our nation's water resources, including fresh, surface, ground, and saline water. Saline water use accounts for approximately 30% of thermoelectric use, while the remaining 70% is from freshwater sources. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that thermoelectric generation accounts for roughly 136,000 million gallons per day (MGD), or 39% of freshwater withdrawals. This ranks slightly behind agricultural irrigation as the top source of freshwater withdrawals in the U.S. in 2000. For Americans to preserve their standard ofmore\u00a0\u00bb living and maintain a thriving economy it is essential that greater attention be paid to freshwater availability in efforts to meet energy demands - particularly for electric power. According to projections by the Energy Information Administration's (EIA) Annual Energy Outlook 2006 (AEO 2006) anticipated growth of thermoelectric generating capacity will be 22% between 2005 and 2030. In the 2007 Report, EIA estimates that capacity to grow from approximately 709 GW in 2005 to 862 GW in 20303. These large increases in generating capacity will result in increased water demands by thermoelectric power plants and greater competition over water between the energy sector and domestic, commercial, agricultural, industrial, and instream use sectors. The implications of these increased demands have not been adequately researched. This report is a preliminary effort to explore these implications. In addition, since this report was completed in draft form in 2007, there have been several updates and important issues brought to bear on water for energy that should be mentioned. Uncertainties include drought and climate change impacts. Policies such as commitments to Coal-to-Liquids (CTL) quotas; Ethanol production requirements; Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) mandates; increasing nuclear power plant construction; valuing carbon and carbon dioxide emissions all have significant implications on water use and on the need for water in the power sector by 2025.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "aeb5d40c7f8d58a56c50725f9e9b9cab2b36d6a2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2177610979", "DOI": "10.2991/IWMECS-15.2015.51", "CorpusId": 97008124}, "title": "First-principles study adsorption properties of CO2 molecule on CaO(100) surfaces", "abstract": "The process of stable adsorption of CO2 molecules on CaO (100) surfaces were studied using a periodic slab model by PW91 of generalized gradient approximation (GGA) within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The results indicated that the surface oxygen atoms (Osurf) are the most active adsorbed sites for adsorb CO2 on the CaO (100) surfaces. It is a truth universally acknowledged that the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) leads to global warming which results in a change in the climatic conditions. Despite this, CO2 or synthetic discharge gas is produced during the burning or gasifying process of the carbon-based fuels, in particular, from the burning of fossil fuel in fossil fuel heat-engine plant which causes more than 30% of the total CO2 emissions (1). The heat-engine plants become the largest source of CO2 emission, and this has attracted significant world-wide attention. However, CO2 is also an effective carbon resource, which can meet the ever increasing demand for energy; thus, providing solution for the environmental problems. Therefore, the economical capture, transport, storage, and transformation of CO2 are highly desirable for the gradual reduction and control of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. In recent years, capture and storage of CO2 by the cyclic reaction involving adsorption, carbonation, and calcination of calcium-based sorbents have attracted significant attention of the researchers world-wide (2-3). Utilizing this technology, CO2 was captured in order to shift the steam reforming equilibrium for the production of hydrogen (4), and the CO2 in dual curing coal combustion system could be attached directly to the bed (5). According to the study of the calcium-based sorbent, the absorptivity of calcium oxide (CaO) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) (with higher theoretical absorbance) is better than other sorbents. Theoretically, 0.786 g of CO2 could be adsorbed by 1 g of CaO. CaO is commercially and readily available as it is easy to prepare (6-7) and it is cost effective. However, reports based on the theoretical research on the CO2 adsorption by CaO are limited (6, 8), and studies on its decomposition kinetics have not been reported.

The starting point of EU policy for the way towards low carbon economy is a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in Power sector by 93-99% by 2050. In line with this objective, in 2014 the European Council adopted the climate-energy frame of 2030, which sets the goal of reducing emissions -40 % by 2030. Also, there is the goal of renewable energy sources to 27% and an indicative target is to reduce energy consumption by 27%. In the electricity sector, in addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions her goal is to increase the security of energy supply, sustainability of energy supply, increase the availability of energy and reduce energy dependency.

Underground Coal Gasification (UCG), an in situ method to extract the calorific value of the coal, has been known for a century but has had very limited implementation throughout the world, mainly due to the availability of cheap oil over that period. It is now gaining relevance in order to unlock vast resources of coal currently not exploitable by conventional mining. However, growing concern on increased levels of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is pointing out the necessity to reduce the use of fossil fuels. Since alternative sources of energy (e.g. nuclear and renewables) are not in a position to meet the constantly increasing demand in a short term, carbon capture and its geological sequestration (CCS) is considered the best remedial option. An environmental risk assessment framework has been developed for coupling UCG to CCS accounting for benefits and cost from both global and local perspectives. A UCG site presents significant differences from other typical CCS projected scenarios, most notably the injection of CO2 into a heavily fractured zone. A model which accounts for flow in fractures represented by dual-porosity flow (TOUGH2) is coupled to a geomechanical model (FLAC3D).

Mangroves are widely recognised as key ecosystems for climate change\nmitigation as they capture and store significant amounts of sediment organic\ncarbon (SOC). Yet, there is incomplete knowledge on how sources of SOC and\ntheir differential preservation vary between mangrove sites in relation to\nenvironmental gradients. To address this, sediment depth profiles were\nsampled from mangrove sites ranging from river-dominated to marine-dominated\nsites and including old and young mangrove sites in the Guayas delta\n(Ecuador). The stable carbon isotope ratios (\u03b413C) and the\nelemental composition (OC\u2009%, C\u2009:\u2009N) of sediment profiles, local vegetation\n(i.e. autochthonous carbon) and externally supplied suspended particulate\nmatter (i.e. allochthonous carbon) were obtained to assess variations in\nthe amount and sources of SOC at different locations throughout the delta.\nIn general, across all sites, we found that increasing SOC contents and stocks\nare associated with decreasing \u03b413C and increasing C\u2009:\u2009N ratios,\nindicating that SOC stocks and sources are intrinsically related. The SOC\nstocks (down to 0.64\u2009m depth profiles) are significantly lower in young\nmangrove sites (46\u201355\u2009Mg\u2009C\u2009ha\u22121) than in old sites (78\u201392\u2009Mg\u2009C\u2009ha\u22121). The SOC in the young mangrove sites is mainly of allochthonous\norigin (estimated on average at 79\u2009%), whereas in the old sites there is a\nslight dominance of autochthonous OC (on average 59\u2009%). Moreover, from\nriver- to marine-dominated sites, a pattern was found of increasing SOC\nstocks and increasing autochthonous SOC contribution. These observed\ndifferences along the two studied gradients are hypothesised to be mainly\ndriven by (1)\u00a0expected higher sedimentation rates in the river-dominated and\nlower-elevation younger sites, thereby `diluting' the SOC content and\ndecreasing the relative autochthonous contribution, and (2)\u00a0potential\ndifferences in preservation of the different SOC sources. Our finding of\nhigh contributions of allochthonous SOC, especially in young mangroves,\nimplies that this carbon is not originating from CO2 sequestration by\nthe mangrove ecosystem itself but is externally supplied from other\nterrestrial, marine or estuarine ecosystems. We argue that accounting for\nlower SOC stocks and higher contribution of allochthonous SOC in young and\nriver-dominated mangrove sites, as compared to old and marine-dominated\nsites, is particularly relevant for designing and valuing nature-based\nclimate mitigation programmes based on mangrove reforestation.\n", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "70dfba52f937de3e839bed2eeea35144c6119929", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3365616", "CorpusId": 115152373}, "title": "! Direct Air Carbon Capture and Sequestration Using a Novel Biomass and Cold Storage Process", "abstract": "Direct air capture (DAC) has received increased attention in recent years as a means of actively decreasing atmospheric CO2 levels and given its diffuse nature lends itself well to novel capture and storage techniques. Numerous methods have been proposed for both the capture and the storage of CO2 directly from the air. These include capture with technologies similar to those studied for point source emissions using sorbents, solvents and membranes. Various storage mechanisms studied include storage in geologic formations and in solid carbonate form. Biomass has been considered as a capture mechanism but is generally dismissed due to a lack of feasible long term storage technology. One notable exception for biomass CO2 capture and storage that has been proposed and studied is bio-energy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS). BECCS can be considered as a general framework in which biomass is combusted and the resulting CO2 emissions are captured and sequestered. A distinct advantage is that this process does not specify or require a particular biomass energy source nor a specific sequestration method. Outside of BECCS, however, biomass is generally considered impractical due to its natural decomposition processes and accosted re-release of captured CO2. In this work we will present a method and detailed life cycle energy analysis for capturing CO2 in biomass and storing it indefinitely in arctic climates. We will also discuss the environmental footprint this process would require. This analysis will show that the energy requirements for biomass stored at low temperature are significantly lower than the more traditional direct capture techniques currently proposed. Furthermore, this process could be implemented on a large scale in the very near term. The biomass can be sourced from \u201clow grade\u201d plants grown in locations that are neither productive for agriculture nor protected for environmental reasons. The biomass can than be stored in thermal conditions that prevent its breakdown by normal biological processes. It is important to consider the transport of biomass material from its origin to an area where it can be stably stored at low temperature.

The thesis begins by overviewing electricity markets, including descriptions of uniformprice and discriminatory-price electricity auctions (and the resulting market power incentives), as well as carbon capture & storage (CCS). The first model is a treatment of the economic withholding potential arising from CCS in a uniform-price electricity auction. A firm that engages in CCS to reduce polluting emissions, thus reducing its carbon tax payment, must devote a fraction of electrical capacity to that effect, removing it from the market. This form of withholding can raise the market price of electricity, providing additional incentive to engage in CCS. With this price effect the carbon tax level at which the firm is indifferent between doing CCS or not is lower compared to without, and the firm may turn on CCS even if the carbon tax does not exceed the cost of doing so. We also analyze CCS in a discriminatory auction, which presents different withholding incentives than the uniform auction, and contributes to the discussion on which format is more desirable. The second area of research investigates allegations of market power abuse in the Alberta electricity market, whereby firms supposedly use public information to raise market prices higher than would otherwise obtain. It studies how this information allows firms to identify themselves through their price offers to their rivals, and asks whether this knowledge affects pricing decisions.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "c0cb9072d239629d41a85fa1082502ad9f0450a2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2381145363", "CorpusId": 133542375}, "title": "Review of Impact of CO_2 Leakage From Geologic Storage on Near-Surface Terrestrial Ecological System", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide capture and storage(CCS) has been recognized as an effective way to mitigate emission of CO2 to the atmosphere and may become a critical technology for global CO2 mitigation,however,the risk of CO2 leaking from its geologic storage will pose a potential threat to the terrestrial ecosystem,especially the near-surface terrestrial ecosystem.From the aspects of the three major components(ground water,soil and vegetation) of the near-surface terrestrial ecosystem,a review is presented of the potential impact of the leakage on the ecosystem and its process,and progresses and shortcomings of the researches,abroad and at home,in this field are summarized.On such a basis,it is indicated that the study on impacts of CO2 leakage from its geologic storage should be focused on evaluation of its impacts on farmland ecosystems,determination of threshold of tolerance of the ecosystems to the leakage,construction of an early warning system for CO2 leakage,and proposition of a system of countermeasures for the terrestrial ecosystem to avoid or mitigate disasters CO2 leakage may cause.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "3445dbe11e66041e4aab01f4687a9e63519d000b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2920177603", "CorpusId": 169876331}, "title": "Community attitudes towards carbon dioxide capture and storage", "abstract": "Community attitudes towards carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) in the energy sector in Australia are discussed.

Such societies face increasing pressures associated with the need for a rapid transition towards a low carbon dioxide and secure energy future at moderate cost (that is, one which is affordable or competitive). These three elements represent the so-called energy policy \u2018trilemma\u2019 (Hammond and Pearson, 2013). In terms of the first element, the British government established a legally binding target of reducing the nation\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions overall by 80% by 2050 in comparison to a 1990 baseline (Climate Change Act 2008, 2008; DTI, 2007). That will be a very difficult task to achieve. Thus, the three elements of the \u2018trilemma\u2019 collectively present many challenges that will require a portfolio of energy options to surmount them: energy demand reduction and efficiency improvements, carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) from fossil fuel power plants and a switch to low or zero carbon dioxide energy sources (such as combined heat and power (CHP), nuclear power stations and renewable energy technologies on a large and small scale). The demand for energy, however, is the main driver of the whole energy system. It gives rise to the total amount of energy used, as well as the location, type of fuel and characteristics of specific end-use technologies. Consequently, the need for reductions in energy demand, and associated \u2018greenhouse gas\u2019 (GHG) emissions, applies across the end-use spectrum from the built environment to industrial processes and products, from materials to design, and from markets and regulation to individual and organisational behaviour. In order to analyse rigorously the energy and environmental consequences of changes in supply and demand of energy-intensive goods and services, it is necessary to take a holistic perspective (Hammond, 2000). This implies drawing the system boundary quite widely \u2013 across the \u2018whole energy system\u2019 or \u2018fuel chain\u2019 on a life-cycle basis. Such an approach is needed because of the complex interaction between sectors and their impacts during the transition to a \u2018low carbon\u2019 future. It is therefore important to trace the whole life of products, services and supporting infrastructure, and their associated energy flows and pollutant emissions, as they pass through the economy. A simplified model of energy flows in the UK is illustrated in Figure 1 (Hammond, 2000). It should be noted that heat is potentially wasted and energy is \u2018lost\u2019 at each stage of energy conversion, transmission and distribution, particularly in connection with the process of electricity generation. This schematic energy flow diagram hides many feedback loops in which primary energy sources (including fossil fuels, uranium ore and hydro-electric sites) and secondary derivatives (such as hydrogen fuel or nuclearand renewable-generated electricity) provide upstream energy inputs into the \u2018energy transformation system\u2019 (Slesser, 1978). The latter is that part of the economy where a raw energy resource is converted into useful energy which can meet downstream, \u2018final\u2019 or \u2018end-use\u2019 demand. \u2018Renewable\u2019 energy sources are taken to mean those that are ultimately solar-derived: mainly solar energy itself, biomass resources and wind power (Hammond, 2000).", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "52aa04c132e41f3496cb9319382907315470127d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2625391040", "CorpusId": 114104944}, "title": "The potential of hydrogen to fuel international shipping", "abstract": "Today the way energy is produced and consumed is under debate as it is increasing the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG), which can cause dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. This means that a de-carbonisation of the global energy system is required. Shipping represents the biggest global low cost international freight transport service, and today it accounts for about 3% of the world's total GHG emissions. Such a percentage is projected to increase by 50% to 250% in the period to 2050. The projected shipping emissions trajectory, therefore, does not seem compatible with the de-carbonisation of the global energy system necessary to meet the internationally agreed goal of reducing the emissions in all sectors and ensure that the temperature rises in 2100 will not be greater than 2_C degree. Since shipping energy demand is mainly satisfied by fuel oil, recent new regulations on efficiency and air pollution have been introduced (EEDI, SEEMP), and instruments that would cut GHG emissions from shipping are under discussion. In the short term (5-10 years) the industry is aiming to reduce its emissions through a combination of technological and operational developments, however in the long term a switch to an alternative fuel may be required. Among the options, hydrogen with fuel cell systems (FCs) is seen by many as one of the long term solutions. Its attraction is not only for its zero operational emissions but also for the higher efficiency that could be achieved on board. Hydrogen and FCs are also seen as promising technologies that can support climate change and energy security goals in several sectors of the energy system. The most attractive uses of hydrogen within the context of a de-carbonization of the energy system are: for storing renewable energy, for heating, and as fuel for the transport sector. Moreover, it can increase the operational flexibility as it can connect different energy sectors and energy transmission and distribution networks. The energy and the shipping systems are interrelated, so if the de-carbonisation of the global energy system could be achieved with the use of alternative energy and fuels including hydrogen, the same could be experienced in shipping with a widespread switch to the adoption of hydrogen as alternative fuel within the coming decades. The purpose of this thesis was to learn more about the potential for hydrogen as a future fuel in shipping. The focus is on a computational modelling approach that is considered to lead to new useful contributions. This study proposes a framework based on a soft-linking technique to examine the potential of using hydrogen in shipping. The framework connects together a global integrated assessment model (TIAM-UCL) and a shipping model (GloTraM). GloTraM is a bottom-up shipping simulation model that is used to evaluate pathways towards a low carbon shipping system; TIAM-UCL is a bottom-up energy system model that is used to investigate possible pathways to reduce the energy and carbon density of the global energy system. The first objective of this study is the development of a new modelling approach that soft-links two existing models in order to improve the modelling representation of hydrogen take up in shipping. The hypothesis is that the model linkage is more representative for exploring specified scenarios, forecasting investment decisions for hydrogen powered ships in conjunction with the hydrogen infrastructure development than the two separate models. The second objective is the analysis of the possible use of hydrogen under specific scenarios in order to understand at a global level the implications of providing and using hydrogen in shipping. The hypothesis is that the model linkage is able to explore the broader circumstance in which it would be possible to see an uptake of hydrogen in shipping and what it might mean for the contribution of shipping in avoiding 2_C of warming. Based on this objectives, this research aims to answer the following research questions: Can an integrated framework that combines two different models improves the modelling representation of hydrogen uptake in shipping compared to the current representations found in the literature? What type of results does the integrated framework provide regarding the potential of hydrogen to compete with LNG and current marine fuels to fuel international shipping? Under what circumstance would hydrogen be able to compete with LNG and current marine fuels in shipping and what would be the main economic and environmental implications? The comparison between the results of the independent and the integrated framework simulations of a specific set of scenarios has highlighted the capability of the framework of modelling the investment decision for ships powered by hydrogen in conjunction with the development of a hydrogen supply infrastructure with a more robust approach compared with the energy and shipping models. Evidence of the modelling improvement was found in: the ability of the model to simulate the equilibrium between marine fuel prices and demands, the ability of the model to capture the dynamics between the carbon price and the shipping fuel mix (how these outputs influence each other), the ability to generate fuel price projections that overcome the limitation of the linear property of the energy system model, the ability of capturing the dynamics between the transport demand among regions and the fuel mix evolution of the global feet. Moreover, a number of circumstances for the potential uptake of hydrogen over LNG were found in this thesis; the key circumstances are: the introduction of an emissions cap in shipping, a competitive hydrogen price and investment costs of hydrogen technologies on board ships (fuel cells and hydrogen storage technologies), and finally the supply of hydrogen mainly based on natural gas and biomass with CCS technology or electrolysis in case of an absence of CCS. The main implication of a switch to hydrogen is that shipping emissions would be reduced significantly over time. This topic was identified as being of importance to assist ship owners and fuel providers in understanding the potential of use of hydrogen in shipping, and to assist policy makers in the development of effective GHG policy for shipping and in understanding the implications of using hydrogen in shipping within the context of a de-carbonised energy system. It is hoped that information from this study may be useful in creating awareness of the potential that hydrogen might have in shipping and in creating incentives for further research required for exploring this option from different perspective. Moreover, this study explores the application of a relative new modelling technique of soft-linking two existing models. The experience engaged in developing such a link could be useful to educators and modellers interested in the soft-linking modelling approach.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "4b5938b811da739fa2bcdb861997b8bcab21ad06", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2015372834", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.20131978", "CorpusId": 128394328}, "title": "Geological Storage of CO2 in Coal Beds - From Material to Reservoir", "abstract": "One of the main issues encountered with CO2 storage in coal beds is the loss of permeability of the reservoir during the injection of carbon dioxide.

Gravity measurements have a unique advantage among many geophysical methods that the mass density change being detected by the gravity within a reservoir is directly and uniquely related to the dynamic fluid redistribution. In this paper the status of a program to develop a wireline deployable three-axis borehole gravity sensor with a target sensitivity of \u223c 5 \u00b5 Gal is firstly introduced, using a resonant MEMS (Microelectromechanical systems) vibrating beam technology innovation. Followed by a feasibility study for monitoring of CO2 in a deep reservoir at the Aquistore storage site in Canada. We model and predict the gravity variation due to density changes during a period of CO2 injection. This study demonstrates the pre-survey feasibility modelling of the emerging field of time-lapse gravity monitoring.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "393e408500d77253c1b6eec51f69545dd584b50b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2589055026", "DOI": "10.1002/GHG.1670", "CorpusId": 132460591}, "title": "Sensitivity of seismic response for monitoring CO 2 storage in a low porosity reservoir of the St Lawrence Lowlands, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada: Part 2 \u2013 Synthetic modeling", "abstract": "Deployment of carbon capture and storage on a large scale poses many challenges. One is the availability of reservoirs with suitable characteristics (high porosity and permeability, matched large emitters, etc.).

The use of biomass from agricultural secondary production as a potential energy source can improve soil quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a complementary, non-competing way. The paper presents a piece of combustion equipment performing the burning process by biomass gasification on the TLUD (Top-Lit UpDraft) principle, from which hot air and biochar are obtained. The main function of this type of gas generator set on the TLUD principle is to generate a syngas flame which can be used as a heat source. The biochar obtained as a by-product is a sterile, active carbon with a large adsorption surface which is used as a soil amendment in environments with limited capacity for carbon sequestration and in soils depleted of resources. Gasification on the TLUD principle occurs when the biomass layer is introduced into the reactor and rests on a grate through which the air flow for gasification passes from bottom to top. Priming of the gasification process is done by igniting the upper layer of biomass in the reactor. The oxidation front continuously descends consuming the biomass in the reactor. Due to the heat radiated by the oxidation front the biomass is heated, dried, and then it enters a fast pyrolysis process from which volatiles emerge and unconverted carbon remains there. When the combustion front reached the grate, all the volatiles in the biomass were gasified and some of the carbon fixed was reduced; about 10 - 20% of the initial mass in the form of sterile charcoal, called biochar, remains on the grill. Compared to wood direct combustion or gasification combustion processes, the TLUD gasification process is characterized by very low values of the superficial velocity of gas passing through the pyrolysis front. The slow process maintains superficial velocity of the generator gas produced at very low values, which ensures reduced carrying away of free ash of approximate size below PM2.5 and maxim values of 5 mg/MJbm when leaving the burner; such values are well below the target imposed in the EU in 2015 for biomass combustion processes, which is below 25 mg/MJ. The result of monitoring the gasification process can be used to automate and optimize the TLUD process in order to achieve green energy, for carbon sequestration in the obtained biochar and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thus contributing to achieving efficient protection of the environment and to ensuring sustainable energy development", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "0dd3208bb606d9c6bdacd54a7261c51edbada620", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1601775908", "CorpusId": 129664968}, "title": "Numerical Modeling of Time-Lapse Seismic Experiments to Monitor CO 2 Sequestration in a Layered Basalt Reservoir", "abstract": "Instead of allowing carbon dioxide (CO2) generated from the burning of hydrocarbons to escape into the atmosphere, CO2 can be captured and stored. For the long term mitigation of the increasing amount of CO2 emissions, its sequestration in geological formations is promising. As a measure, its short and long term monitoring is equally important for environmental and health safety issues. The seismic method is proposed as a non-invasive monitoring technique for geological sequestration of CO2. Based on the positive results obtained from reservoir monitoring during enhanced oil recovery with CO2 floods, geoscientists plan to inject CO2 in layered basalt. CO2 mineralizes rapidly while it is exposed to mafic rocks. Due to CO2 injection, the physical properties of the reservoirs, such as the elastic moduli and the density change. These changes have effects on the seismic velocities. Although basalt seems to have advantages as a reservoir from the CO2 storage point of view, it poses some considerable challenges in terms of seismic monitoring. Strong multiple scattering from the layering of the basalt and high scattering attenuation complicate surface seismic imaging. To investigate the possibilities and limitations of time-lapse seismic monitoring of CO2 injection in a basalt reservoir, a number of numerical simulations are performed. The Spectral Element Method (SEM) and its modeling package SEM2DPACK is used for synthetic data generation. A base case (unperturbed) model is generated and the seismic velocity is perturbed in the reservoir to generate post-CO2 injection models. Among surface seismic, traditional Vertical Seismic Profiling (VSP), and downhole VSP methods used for monitoring purpose, results obtained from the downhole VSP method show significant differences between the preand post-injection seismic sections.

It constitutes the first attempt to holistically evaluate both the techno-economic performance and the environmental benefits of employing BECCS in fuel generation. For an input of 1020 dry tonnes per day of woody biomass, the FTS route yields 275 t d\u22121, the bioSNG route yields 238 t d\u22121 and the OMEx route yields 635 t d\u22121 of fuel and the energy efficiency is in the range of 44.9% to59.7% without CCS and 44.0% to 58.2% with CCS.

This study aims to evaluate the potential of reusing Fe-rich mine waste for carbon sequestration by assessing the influence of pH condition, particle size fraction and reaction temperature on the carbonation reaction. A carbonation experiment was performed in a stainless steel reactor at ambient pressure and at a low temperature. The results indicated that the alkaline pH of waste samples was suitable for undergoing the carbonation process. Mineralogical analysis confirmed the presence of essential minerals for carbonation, i.e., magnetite, wollastonite, anorthite and diopside. The chemical composition exhibited the presence of iron and calcium oxides (39.58\u201362.95%) in wastes, indicating high possibilities for carbon sequestration. Analysis of the carbon uptake capacity revealed that at alkaline pH (8\u201312), 81.7\u201387.6 g CO2/kg of waste were sequestered. Furthermore, a particle size of <38 \u00b5m resulted in 83.8 g CO2/kg being sequestered from Fe-rich waste, suggesting that smaller particle sizes highly favor the carbonation process. Moreover, 56.1 g CO2/kg of uptake capacity was achieved under a low reaction temperature of 80 \u00b0C. These findings have demonstrated that Fe-rich mine waste has a high potential to be utilized as feedstock for mineral carbonation. Therefore, Fe-rich mine waste can be regarded as a valuable resource for carbon sinking while producing a value-added carbonate product.

One such problem, which also forms the basis of this thesis, is the effect of these measures on corrosion and deposition of the boiler heat transfer surfaces. This research work can be divided into two parts. The first part involved studying the corrosion behaviour of a typical waterwall and a superheater material under simulated oxy-fuel environments with and without the influence of an ash deposit. A custom-built, laboratory scale, corrosion rig with the ability to simulate a range of flue gas compositions and temperatures, in addition to generating a heat flux through the specimen, was set up for this purpose. The second part of this work deals with evaluating the properties of a UK power station coal and four biomass samples with the help of laboratory techniques and thermodynamic modelling in order to predict their fusion and deposit forming tendencies in combustion systems. A series of experiments were performed on the corrosion rig to assess the influence of individual variables on the rate of corrosion. The results indicated that the increased concentration of SO2 in oxy fuel combustion due to recycling of the flue gas, can lead to an increase in corrosion rates especially in the presence of reactive alkali containing deposits. Under the conditions studied, the presence of a biomass ash deposit aggravated the corrosive propensity of the environment while coal ash lessened it. With regard to predicting the fusion behaviour of different ashes, the standard ash fusion tests proved inadequate for explaining the relationship between high alkali constituents in biomass ash and the expected higher slagging and fouling tendencies. Simultaneous thermal analysis was more useful in assessing the physical & chemical changes taking place in the ash. Prediction of the fuel behaviour using FactSage thermodynamic analysis showed that ash melting commences at much lower temperatures than those predicted from laboratory techniques. This would help to explain the increased risk of deposition and corrosion linked with burning high alkali containing fuels.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "18690bc83eafe78380d980f771670d0aed7d633a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2921915895", "DOI": "10.1109/IBCAST.2019.8667177", "CorpusId": 84185535}, "title": "Energy generation from metal-water reaction for power systems, underwater and aerospace propulsion applications", "abstract": "The performance of a fuel, or propellant, depends critically on its combustion characteristics which have a direct impact on the system performance, reliability, long-term stability and environmental footprint. Also, cost, operability and material availability must be considered. Based on what has already been investigated in previous studies, metal fuels can be combusted with water or even with air as oxidizers to generate heat for many applications. Furthermore, when they are burned with air, low-net-carbon emissions can be achieved by capturing and recycling the combustion products. When metals react with water under specific conditions, it produces hydrogen on demand in exothermic reactions. Metals can be produced with clean primary energy through electrolysis, or other methods, and then store this energy as a chemical one in the metal fuel that can be released through oxidation by air, water, or even carbon dioxide, amongst other oxidants. Metals represent a promising solution for the future of propulsion and energy-conversion applications due to their reactivity with water, high energy densities and wide availability. However, as it is demonstrated in other studies, there are key limitations about the waste of the thermal energy in the case of low-temperature reactions and the waste of the chemical energy contained within the generated hydrogen as a reaction product in the case of high-temperature propulsion applications. Also, this concept when applied for onboard vehicles presents a number of difficulties related to storage systems and reaction rate kinetics. The objective of this work is to explore and investigate relevant, recent alternatives for developing clean energy with high performances based on hydrogen generation from metal-water reactions, focusing basically on rocket propulsion. The main characteristics of energy from metal fuels are numerically investigated and compared to the ones of the conventional, existing fuels. The techniques that are to be possibly used for exploiting the energetic potential of metal-water reactions are as follows: low-temperature metal-water reactors for fuel cells or other power systems, and high energy densities metals and water mixtures as propellants for underwater and aerospace propulsion.

The government of Cambodia has set up the Power Development Plan (PDP) 2020 which mainly emphasizes the development of renewable energy and coal-based power.

T latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts an unequivocal warming of the climate system (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007). This global warming is mainly due to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, for the most part CO2. The annual increase observed in atmospheric CO2, however, is substantially less than the increase in anthropogenic emissions, showing the importance of terrestrial sinks in C sequestration (Canadell et al., 2007; Luyssaert et al., 2007). Globally, the land C sink accounted for about 30% of the total anthropogenic emissions from 2000 to 2006 (Canadell et al., 2007). Therefore, an evaluation of the C fixation in natural systems would be useful for the research community worldwide, especially in the context of the Kyoto Protocol (IGBP Terrestrial Carbon Working Group, 1998). All plant sites (savannah, rainforest, forest, grasslands, shrubland, annual crops, and tundra) can capture CO2 from the air; however, the effectiveness of terrestrial uptake as a C sink depends on this being transformed to forms with long residence times (Prentice et al., 2003). In contrast to annual plants, such as maize (Zea mays L.) or sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.), which can sequestrate more C than forest systems (Watson et al., 2000) but for shorter periods (Jansson et al., 2010), evergreen tree species could originate a sustainable ecosystem based on their high C fixation potential; this is due to their year-round activity maintaining living roots even in winter, the longevity of trees (>30 yr), vigorous growth, deeper and more extensive root systems, high leaf area index, and slow leaf turnover (Liguori et al., 2009). Numerous researchers have studied the impact of different factors on the C fixation ability in forests (among others, Navar, 2009; Djomo et al., 2011; McEwan et al., 2011; Alvarez et al., 2012). In the European Union (EU), however, half of the surface area is used for agricultural purposes, hence the importance of ecological studies on the potential sink capacity of evergreen trees in the EU\u2019s natural environment. In Mediterranean countries, citrus fruits are the second largest EU fruit crop after apple (Malus domestica Borkh.). Spain is the leading citrus-producing country in the area, with nearly 60% of EU production. In Spain, citrus orchards cover around 300 103 ha (6 106 Mg), of which up to 60 and 25% is developed in the Comunidad Valenciana and Andalucia, respectively. This crop could have great potential as an important sink of C; however, current assays aimed at estimating this C fixation capacity are very scarce. Quantification of the amount of CO2 removed from the atmosphere through net C exchange is known as net primary production (NPP), which is, in terms of CO2 exchange, the amount of C that is retained by plants after assimilation through photosynthesis (gross primary production, GPP) and autotrophic respiration (Ra) (Clark et al., 2001):", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "944af4c362ff935eda32117f13e6a1946faf159a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2181491093", "CorpusId": 98019802}, "title": "NEED OF THERMOPHYSICAL DATA FOR THE DESIGN AND OPTIMIZATION OF THERMAL PROCESSES", "abstract": "years ago, the need for thermophysical data for thermal processes was limited to a relatively small number of mostly pure working fluids as, e.g., water, carbon dioxide, or some few refriger- ants.

This did already change in the nineties, when al- ternative pure and mixed refrigerants were needed with zero ozone depletion and low global warm- ing potential.

First: suitable working fluids are needed for organic Rankine cycle (ORC) processes which are used to convert heat from geothermal, solar or biomass sources or waste heat to electric energy. Second: some examples for the need of thermophysical data in carbon diox- ide capture and sequestration are given. This leads to third: there is only very limited knowledge of the thermal properties of compressed humid air or combustion gases, which are used in compressed air energy storage, humid air turbines or carbon dioxide separation and sequestration technologies.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "77eec2c80c2e68ff9fb016b4c54ec405517a723b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2298615194", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.2619551", "CorpusId": 111701701}, "title": "Coal and Gas - From Cradle to Grave with Carbon Capture and Storage: An Efficiency Analysis", "abstract": "Existing studies on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) only focus on costs and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) reduction that arise at the power plant and geological storage.

We show that the true costs vary between 70 and 90 US-Dollars per ton of CO2 . Additional sensitivity analyses support the results because they are robust against different parameter adjustments.

Deep saline aquifers were recognized as the largest potential storage resource available worldwide for CO2 storage into geological formations. Securing the geological storage of CO2 is mandatory with this kind of project. Indeed, under specific conditions, the resulting pressure build-up of a CO2 injection into an aquifer can possibly lead to leak into shallow geological aquifers or atmosphere through preferential pathways such as geological faults and wells. The brine extraction is envisaged to decrease the reservoir pressure build-up while injecting CO2. In this study, an investigation was made to use a part of this extracted brine to increase the CO2 storage security by accelerating both residual and solubility trapping mechanisms through the deployment of water (W) alternative CO2 (G) injection (WAG_CCS) at field scale. If this alternative CO2 injection process gives interesting results, then this approach will also lead to the reduction of the duration of post-injection site monitoring. In addition, the WAG_CCS process may help increasing the sweep efficiency of CO2 by controlling the mobility ratio and consequently improving the storage capacity.\n Several WAG_CCS pattern models were simulated with Eclipse software to investigate the impact of the method. A real geological model of an aquifer (Sleipner model, public data) was used for the simulations. As simulation base case, the CO2 is injected into the aquifer through one injection well for a period of 25 years followed by a 3500 years post injection simulation. Several other injection scenarios are simulated where water (W) is extracted from the same formation and partly reinjected alternatively with CO2 (G). The injection period schedules are as follow: 3months(G)-3months(W) to 1year(G)-1year(W). The mobile gas volume (structural trapping) and residual gas volume and dissolved gas volume (solubility trapping) are compared for all simulated cases.\n An experimental design screening was implemented in order to investigate the impact of several parameters such as well numbers, permeability, critical gas saturation\u2026\n The results of this study gave answers to the WAG_CCS process efficiency in CO2 geological storage. It can be concluded that it can (1) be efficient under realistic geological conditions; (2) speed up the capillary trapping mechanism; (3) accelerate the dissolution trapping mechanism; (4) control the CO2 mobility and increase the sweep efficiency of CO2; and (5) help to manage project risks.\n The water extraction from an aquifer during the CO2 storage is a subject which was already studied and proposed in several publications but the utilization of the extracted water is still a research subject. Extracted water desalinization, reinjection in depleted formations, surface dissolution of CO2 within the extracted water before injection are some of investigated subjects.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "8de29f6be2c9d0c68b0e329dfde3ca2e4b2f36ab", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 46079449}, "title": "climate policy \u2019 s most inconvenient truth", "abstract": "Governments around the world are now struggling with the question of how to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming. the task is bigger than any other environmental challenge humanity has faced. carbon dioxide, the leading human cause of global warming, is an intrinsic byproduct of burning the fossil fuels that power the world economy and thus difficult to regulate. all fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide when burned, but the real heart of the warming problem is coal. emissions from coal are growing faster than from any other fossil fuel. beyond greenhouse-gas pollution, coal is linked to a host of other environmental troubles such as local air pollution, which is why a powerful coalition of environmentalists in the richest and greenest countries is rallying to stop coal. mired in opposition, barely any new coal plants are being built anywhere in the industrialized world. coal, it may seem, is on the precipice. Yet coal remains indispensable. no other fuel matches its promise of cheap and abundant energy for development. about half the electricity in the United states comes from burning coal. germany, the anchor of old europe\u2019s economy, is a coal country. poland, the heart of new europe, gets 90 percent of its electricity from coal. the fast-growing economies of asia, in particular china and india, are all coal-fired. indeed, while the outlook for coal consumption in the industrialized world is flat, soaring asian growth is expected nearly to double world consumption by 2030. the central task of any serious (and politically viable) global-warming policy, then, is to reconcile these diverging patterns. measured by this standard, the world\u2019s leading governments have barely begun to get serious, as the troubled efforts to negotiate a successor to the Kyoto treaty, which expires in 2012, have revealed. the largest hurdle is reaching agreement on the division of efforts between the highly industrialized and the still-emerging countries. the rich industrialized nations account for most historical emissions and seem to care the most about global warming, yet essentially all growth in emissions now occurs within the emerging countries. china is, by far, the world\u2019s largest coal burner and therefore the world\u2019s largest emitter. a host of new technologies make it possible, in theory, to burn coal while safely burying nearly all the pollution underground; \u201ccarbon capture and storage\u201d plants using this technology are the industry darlings. but enthusiastic talk about such technologies notwithstanding, real investment in this very expensive option is a bare whisper. coal thus sits at the center of the most inconvenient truth about global-warming policy: the countries that proclaim greatest concern about global warming are barely investing in the new coal plants that could help chart a better path for the world. meanwhile, the fastest-growing countries have few incentives to invest in new climate-friendly technologies. and simplistic solutions, such as banning coal outright, are politically na\u00efve because the fuel is so easy to use and offers the cheapest way to electrify most of the world.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "77047ccf15d46c515a2bcd5292ac519c13bff325", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2159805971", "DOI": "10.1109/APPEEC.2011.5749122", "CorpusId": 98569585}, "title": "An Evaluation of CO2 Emission Reduction through Carbonation Technology", "abstract": "Researchers around the world are studying on different carbon capture and storage (CCS) options to reduce global warming by reducing CO 2 emission from various sources.

We compare the strict standard with a flexible one that imposes a surcharge for emissions in excess of the standard. A third policy allows the surcharge revenue to fund later CCS retrofits. Analytical results indicate that increasing flexibility leads to earlier introduction of CCS, lower aggregate emissions and higher profits. We test this using multi-stage stochastic optimization, with uncertain future natural gas and emissions allowance prices. Under perfect foresight, the analytical predictions hold.

Share of urban population will increase from present 50\u201370% by 2050 globally. The share of urban land will be also progressively increasing to accommodate the growing number of urbanites. This chapter discusses strategies to carbonize urban areas, so that more carbon (C) per capita can be stored there. It starts with a brief review of the urban C cycle. Two features distinguish urban C cycle from other ecosystems: (1) C cycling of a city and its footprint are intimately linked and (2) natural and anthropogenic components of urban C cycle are equally important and interdependent. Then major pools and mechanisms for C storage in both anthropogenic and natural components of the urban C cycle are reviewed. Soil is the largest potential C pool followed by vegetation, landfills, and buildings. Although in settlements with low build-up density soil may store more than 60% of total C, in densely build-up cities soils and buildings may store equal amounts of C (\u223c40% each). Potential of C storage in landfills is controversial, because of accompanying methane emissions and groundwater pollution. Human-driven mechanisms for C accumulation in cities such as import of C containing materials supersede the natural ones. At the current level of technology any option for carbonization of cities is associated with CO2 emissions.
