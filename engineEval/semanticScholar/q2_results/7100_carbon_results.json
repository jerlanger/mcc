Thus, the capture of SO2 gas is very important for the environment. Graphene which is twodimensional material has excellent mechanical, chemical, thermal properties, and many application areas such as energy storage devices, gas adsorption, sensing devices, and optical electronics. Further, graphene oxide (GO) is examined as a good adsorbent because of its important features such as functional groups (epoxy, carboxyl and hydroxyl) on the surface and layered structure. The SO2 adsorption properties of the fibers are usually investigated on carbon fibers. In this study, potential adsorption capacity of GO fibers was researched. GO dispersion was first obtained with Hummers\u2019 method from graphite, and then GO fibers were obtained via wet spinning process. These fibers were converted into a disc shape, dried, and then subjected to SO2 gas adsorption test. The SO2 gas adsorption capacity of GO fiber discs was investigated in the fields of utilization of different coagulation baths and reduction by hydrazine hydrate. As coagulation baths, single and triple baths were used. In single bath, only ethanol and CaCl2 (calcium chloride) salt were added. In triple bath, each bath has a different concentration of water/ethanol and CaCl2 salt, and the disc obtained from triple bath has been called as reference disk. The fibers which were produced with single bath were flexible and rough, and the analyses show that they had higher SO2 adsorption capacity than triple bath fibers (reference disk). However, the reduction process did not increase the adsorption capacity, because the SEM images showed that the layers and uniform structure in the fiber form were damaged, and reduction decreased the functional groups which SO2 will be attached. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyzes were performed on the fibers and discs, and the effects on the results were interpreted. In the future applications of the study, it is aimed that subjects such as pH and additives will be examined.

Although fluid exchange between the deep basal aquifer system and the upper aquifer layers is generally impeded by confining clay layers and lignite, this study\u2019s geochemical data suggest, for the first time, that deep circulating fluids penetrate shallow aquifers in the locality of fault zones, implying\u00a0 that sub-vertical fluid flow occurs along faults in the LRE. However, large hydraulic-head gradients observed across many faults suggest that they act as barriers to lateral groundwater flow. Therefore, the geochemical data reported here also substantiate a conduit-barrier model of fault-zone hydrogeology in unconsolidated sedimentary deposits, as well as corroborating the concept that faults in unconsolidated aquifer systems can act as loci for hydraulic connectivity between deep and shallow aquifers. The implications of fluid flow along faults in sedimentary basins worldwide are far reaching and of particular concern for carbon capture and storage (CCS) programmes, impacts of deep shale gas recovery for shallow groundwater aquifers, and nuclear waste storage sites where fault zones could act as potential leakage pathways for hazardous fluids.R\u00e9sum\u00e9L\u2019eau souterraine des aquif\u00e8res s\u00e9dimentaires meubles superficiels proches de la faille de Bornheim dans le graben du Bas-Rhin (GBR), Allemagne, pr\u00e9sente des valeurs de \u03b42H et \u03b418O relativement basses en comparaison de celles de la recharge r\u00e9gionale actuelle des eaux souterraines et des concentrations en 4He atteignant 1.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 cm3 (STP) g\u20131\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\u00a0% (environ 4 ordres de grandeur plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que pr\u00e9vu en raison de l\u2019\u00e9quilibre de solubilit\u00e9 avec l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re).

Now more than ever, it is crucial that what we do to reduce our emissions can deliver both near term and sustained positive impacts across the economy to ensure prosperity and justice in our society. This special joint paper from the Centre of Energy Policy at the University of Strathclyde (CEP) and the Bellona Foundation considers the design of a Framework for recovery that could align our near-term economic priorities with both short and medium-term climate goals.

Methane emission mitigation activities undertaken by oil and natural gas companies prevent the loss of a valuable non-renewable resource by directing this clean energy source to beneficial use either via sales or internal use. At the same time, companies are reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases, improving operational safety and enhancing the efficiency of their operations. Further economic and operational benefits can result when methane mitigation activities reduce maintenance and fuel requirements or result in the capture of other valuable hydrocarbon resources. Numerous proven cost-effective technologies and practices exist that oil and natural gas companies have implemented to reduce methane emissions while also generating positive cash flows from utilizing the methane. This paper summarizes a number of established methods to identify, measure, and reduce methane emissions from a variety of equipment and processes in oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. The following detailed discussions provide background on expected levels of vented and fugitive methane emissions from natural gas processing plants, compressor stations, storage tanks, centrifugal compressors, and well completion activities, based on published data and industry experience. This information is supported with case studies covering mitigation activities that have been undertaken by Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (PEMEX) in Mexico, Pluspetrol in Argentina, EnCana Oil & Gas (USA), Inc. in the United States, and Gazprom in Russia. For each case study, operational, economic and environmental considerations are discussed to show how these companies are delivering greater revenue as well as environmental, efficiency and safety benefits while also conserving natural gas resources worldwide.

By 2020, it is anticipated that these figures will increase by 35%, reaching 1.827 billion tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, which equates to 127.9 billion m 3 of natural gas lost to the atmosphere.

One of several options is carbon capture and storage (CCS) after electricity production. Storage of carbon dioxide in geological reservoirs is attributed to three different processes, i) filling of pore space within the reservoir by gaseous or supercritical CO2 (pore trapping), ii) dissolution of the CO2 into the formation water (solubility trapping) and iii) precipitation of carbonate as mineral phase (mineral trapping). The potential of the latter is considerably uncertain, but has probably the most long-term potential of carbon sequestration in the subsurface. Underlying concepts of geochemical equilibria computation are discribed for the conditions of pressure and temperature in deep reservoirs up to 300&#176;C and 1000 atmospheres. The geochemical codes Phreeqc and MIN3P have recently been upgraded for that purpose and were applied in the study.

A case study from the Oklahoma Panhandle*", "abstract": "One of the challenges confronting carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (CCS) in geologic media over extended periods of time is determining the caprock sealing capacity. If the pressure of supercritical carbon dioxide injected in the repository overcomes the caprock sealing capacity, leaking of may enter other porous formations, compromising the storage formation, or even may go back to the atmosphere, and thus the process of sequestration becomes futile. Carbon dioxide sealing capacity is controlled by two groups of parameters: (1) texture (e.g., the pore-throat size, distribution, geometry, and sorting; median grain size, porosity, degree of bioturbation, specific surface area, preferred orientation of matrix clay minerals, orientation, and aspect of ratio of organic particles) and (2) composition (mineralogical content, proportion of soft, deformable mineral grains to rigid grains, organic matter content, carbonate content, silt content, cementation, ductility, compaction, and ash content). The primary goal of this study was to investigate several parameters listed above and to estimate their respective contributions to sealing capacity to better understand its role in shale and carbonates. To assess the effect of textural and compositional properties on maximum retention column height, we collected 30 representative core samples from caprock formations in three counties (Cimarron, Texas, and Beaver) in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The study area was chosen because it hosts three depleted gas fields with a storage capacity of more than 35 million bbl and is situated at a crossroad leading to some significant stationary sources from North Texas, South Kansas, and northern Oklahoma. We used mercury injection porosimetry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Sedigraph energy dispersive spectra (EDS), x-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer\u2013Emmett\u2013Teller-specific surface area, and total organic carbon (TOC) measurements to assess textural and compositional properties of collected samples. The range of column height for the samples used in this study is between 0.2 and 1358 m (0.66 and 4455 ft). The average column height is 351 m (1152 ft). The depth interval approximately 1400 m (4593 ft) could reach relatively high values of column height, up to 1200 m (3937 ft). The above-mentioned interval is composed of mainly Cherokee and Morrowan Formations (shale seals). Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out to infer the possible relationships between textural and compositional parameters. Generally, composition of our samples (shales vs. carbonates and sandstones) indicates a relatively stronger control on caprock sealing capacity, although individual mineral makeup of shale samples seems not correlated with retention column heights. In the same time, many textural parameters play a significant role in determining the sealing capacity of carbonate caprocks.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "dcf2b74ac79f9e6d5209c9f3332b7e9cf623ca01", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 212589482}, "title": "Estimation of Carbon Sequestration potential of Bilaspur district using Computer based CO2FIX Model", "abstract": "Climate change is the burning topic for the world.

Through biological, chemical or physical processes, CO2 is captured from the atmosphere. Carbon sequestration is a way to mitigate the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere released by the burning of fossil fuels and other anthropogenic activities. Trees and crops is the most appropriate solution to mitigate CO2 from the atmosphere. Many studies have reported the carbon sequestration potential (CSP) of forest and agroforestry in India (1, 2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9).In India, an average sequestration potential in agroforestry has been estimated to be 25 Mg C ha-1 over 96 million ha (10), but there is a considerable variation in different regions depending upon the biomass production (11 and 12) and method of estimation. Most of the estimates are based on biomass productivity and do not take into account contributions such as soil and others. This is mainly due to absence of a standard methodology for carbon sequestration potential in Indian context. MATERIALS AND METHODS STUDY AREA Bilaspur is a city in Bilaspur District in the Indian state of Chhattisgarh, situated 133 km (83 miles) north of the state capital, NayaRaipur. The coordinate of district are 22.09\u00b0N 82.15\u00b0E. Bilaspur is situated on the banks of the rain-fed Arpa River, which originates from the high hills of the Maikal Range of central India. Bilaspur is known for its aromatic rice variety named Doobraj rice.

Carbon-containing greenhouse gas emissions mainly come from the following aspects: (1) fossil fuel combustion; (2) leakage and volatilization in the process of fuel extraction, processing, transportation, and industrial utilization; (3) traditional biomass fuel combustion. The greenhouse effect will cause an increase in temperature, the rise of sea level, and the reduction of biodiversity. Due to little or no carbon emissions, new energy is a current research direction. It mainly includes wind energy, solar energy, hydropower, nuclear energy, and biological energy. Among them, wind power technology is quite mature, and the cost of wind power has become competitive in the market. Solar energy is an inexhaustible, nonpolluting, renewable, and clean energy source, which is gradually entering the stage of large-scale development. Hydropower is clean energy, renewable, pollution-free, and low operating costs. Nuclear energy is characterized by high efficiency and low carbon, coming from the fission energy released by the fission reaction of the fissionable material (nuclear fuel) in the nuclear reactor. Biomass resources can be divided into four categories: forest resources, crop straws, poultry manure, and household garbage, and its biggest feature is its renewability. Besides, carbon capture and carbon storage are other ways to reduce carbon emissions. Carbon capture uses chemical adsorption, physical adsorption, adsorption separation, and membrane separation to capture carbon dioxide. Carbon storage injects supercritical CO2 into a closed geological structure containing oil, gas, water, or non-commercial coal seams through pipeline technology to form long-term or permanent CO2 storage", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "92c45c6a8eb6c47013672b96e20a84f8a9f127fa", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2292191195", "CorpusId": 101274345}, "title": "Abstraction from weak C-H Bond of ortho/paramethylcyclohexadienone isomers critical in improving product distribution in anisole pyrolysis", "abstract": "ion from weak C-H Bond of ortho/paramethylcyclohexadienone isomers critical in improving product distribution in anisole pyrolysis 1Chemical and Biological Engineering Department Colorado School of Mines 2Ghent University Belgium March 22, 2015 Yogesh Koirala1 Hans-Heinrich Carstensen2 Stephanie Villano1 Marie-Francoise Reyniers2 Guy B.

In order to have a positive effect on our environment by reducing carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere, carbon dioxide capture and utilization or storage is being researched upon recently to make it more efficient and economical. In this paper, the literature survey gathers light upon the different methods of carbon dioxide capture, its advantages and disadvantages, study on membrane technology, graphene membrane properties and synthesis and suitable graphene based composite membrane for carbon dioxide capture. In this paper, capturing and usage of carbon dioxide gas is discussed along with the economics of it. Sodium chloride (NaCl) and glycerin was recovered from a process waste by-product of an industry named Cardolite for the usage of captured CO2. The purity of NaCl after recovery was determined using flame photometric estimation of Sodium ion content and titration method using Silver Nitrate for the Chloride ion content & the total purity was found. Sodium carbonate is formed by adding ammonium bicarbonate to the obtained NaCl solution which is one of the methods to form sodium carbonate from NaCl. The other method of forming sodium carbonate from NaCl is by bubbling carbon dioxide through ammoniacal brine solution. This method is highlighted in the carbon dioxide kit in which CO2 gas is filtered using membrane technology-Graphene Oxide (GO) composite membrane. Graphene oxide is prepared using modified Hummer\u2019s method. The obtained GO was confirmed using various analytical methods viz. SEM, EDAX and XRD. The GO composite membrane is placed in the carbon dioxide capturing kit and the mixture of gases is passed through. The filtered CO2 is then tested for its concentration using gas sensors and hence process is repeated till the required efficiency.

The global CO2 storage capacity of saline aquifers is much greater than the other options and it is possible to find nearby major sources of CO2. The suitability of a potential geological storage site should be investigated carefully by taking into account a number of geochemical and geomechanical factors. Of these factors, it is important to analyse the effects of the induced changes in pressure and stresses caused by CO2 injection on the behaviour of the rock mass, especially the caprock and any major traversing low permeability geological structures. The geochemical immaturity of the reservoirs is also important. This study aims to develop a better understanding of aspects of the failure of caprock during and after the sequestration of carbon dioxide into geological formations deep below the surface. This project examines the various factors and processes affecting the geomechanics of rocks, since CO2 storage integrity may be seriously jeopardized by the fracturing or reopening of a pre-existing non-transmissive fault in the reservoir or caprock formation. In the present study, a comprehensive literature review of the geomechanical and geochemical processes involved in the carbon geo-sequestration was conducted which highlights relevant processes in conjunction with theories related to the mechanical and flow behaviour of formation rocks. The effects of pore fluid properties on the characteristics of reservoir rocks are also important when studying CO2 sequestration in saline formations and are investigated in this study using two types of locally-available sandstone specimens. The investigation also focuses on the experimental and numerical analysis of the flow and mechanical behaviour of the reservoirs and caprocks and their response to the injection of CO2. This is achieved by the investigation of the fluid flow-related properties of intact and fractured rock specimens obtained from the Otway Basin Pilot Project (OBPP) in Victoria, Australia. The main objectives of this study are as follows: \u2022 Development of a comprehensive literature review and a novel laboratory set-up for the testing of rock specimens close to realistic sequestration reservoir conditions. \u2022 A laboratory investigation and analysis of reservoir and caprock specimens to assess their hydromechanical characteristics. These tests are intended to be carried out at the pressure and temperature conditions which are expected to occur in the reservoir chosen for sequestration project. \u2022 Studying the effects fractures on the flow characteristics of rock specimens. \u2022 Development of exclusive models to understand, extrapolate and reproduce the intact and fracture flow behaviour of rocks as identified from the laboratory results. The development of a parametric reservoir-scale model to demonstrate the safety and efficiency of saline aquifers and support their suitability as promising CO2 storage reservoirs is also attempted. \u2022 Investigating the effects of geomechanical and geochemical interaction between rock minerals, brine and dissolved CO2 on the rock properties and the overall mechanical properties of reservoir rocks. \u2022 Analysing the deformation behaviour of reservoir and caprock specimens using the Acoustic Emission (AE) and visual surface strain measurement systems (ARAMIS). An elaborate high pressure and temperature-controlled laboratory apparatus was developed for the experimental investigation of rock specimens. This test set-up and the data acquisition system were developed in-house and were calibrated prior to the commencement of the test series. The set-up is presented and explained in detail in Chapter 3. The chapter also explains the methodology developed for the preparation, installation and testing of the rock specimens. Two locally-available types of sandstones (S and M-type) were used for the study of the effects of brine and CO2-rich brine saturation on the mechanical properties of reservoir rocks. Brine saturation at different values of NaCl concentration is found to cause a significant difference in the sandstone properties. Uniaxial compressive testing of the CO2-rich brine-saturated sandstone specimens revealed that sandstones cores with high clay content allow the dissolved CO2 and brine to chemically interact with the clay minerals and exhibit noticeable changes to their mechanical properties. These results will aid better understanding of the geomechanical response of saline formations with different types of reservoir rock materials and salinities to CO2 injection and dissolution. Visual and acoustic emission strain measurement systems were also used in addition to strain gauges; in order to carefully study the deformation-related engineering properties of the specimens under different brine saturations. Reservoir integrity is a critical factor for the long-term safe storage of CO2 in geological formations. Therefore, this study involved the hydromechanical testing of rock specimens from the OBPP reservoir and caprock layers. The triaxial and uniaxial testing set-ups and the acoustic emission measurement system explained in Chapter 3 were used for the extensive experimental study of the mechanical and flow-related properties of the rock specimens under brine and CO2 injection, and the results are reported in Chapter 5. The sandstone specimens from the reservoir region of the OBPP system possess very high porosity and permeability while they were also found to be physically and petrologically highly heterogeneous as thin layers of black coal and clay (mostly parallel to the stereographic alignment) were discovered in the core specimens. At the same time the specimens exhibit small weak matrix bands which can fail under axial compression resulting in the formation of compaction bands. Experimental results of triaxial testing of intact and fractured reservoir specimens reveal that these compaction bands can greatly affect the permeability of these sandstone specimens. On reservoir scale this may lead to compartmentalization of the storage reservoir, significantly hampering the overall storage capacity and integrity of the geological formation. Numerical models for different types of rock failure under triaxial stresses and their impact on the fluid flow properties of the rock specimens were developed using COMSOL Multiphysics (a FEM analytical software tool). These models also validate the triaxial experimental results by reproducing the observations of fluid flow similar to those recorded in the laboratory investigation. A reservoir-scale model was also developed to simulate the processes that take place in a saline aquifer CO2 storage system. The hypothetical reservoir model was investigated for a total period of 100 years (including 30 years of injection phase and 70 years of CO2 storage) in intact state. The laboratory scale models successfully determine the compaction-related hydromechanical characteristics of the reservoir rocks and the reservoir-scale model demonstrates long term safety of CO2 storage in an ideal, but hypothetical reservoir system.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "bfc50bf4d222b2154c8ba9630746fac800a411da", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1073/pnas.ss11538", "CorpusId": 52293014, "PubMed": "30228176"}, "title": "PNAS Plus Significance Statements", "abstract": "Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a crucial technology needed to limit warming to the 2 \u00b0C target of the Paris Agreement.

This is expected to remain unchanged for a long time as the world energy consumption doubles. Renewable energy is often a better option since it is environmental friendly but its technologies are not financially available for most countries. Carbon (IV) oxide capture and sequestration (CCS) is necessary for meaningful greenhouse gases reduction in the immediate future. CCS could reduce emissions by 19%. This is an important bridge between our lifestyle and an environmental friendly world. The components of CCS system include; capture (separation and compression), transport, injection and finally monitoring. Power plants, which are gas and coal fired, are the main source of CO2. Other candidate sources include; cement production plants, refineries, petrochemical industries, oil and gas processing firms and natural gas wells. The methods of capturing CO2 are pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-combustion/oxy-fuel. Possible sequestration places for the captured CO2 include; geological storage, for example depleted oil and gas reservoir, enhanced oil recovery, un-minable coal seams and deep saline formations, ocean storage, mineral carbonation and algal growth. Each of the methods above has their advantages and shortcomings as discussed in the research paper. CO2 can be utilized in various ways like, conversion into renewable fuels, formic acid, syngas, methane and methanol, utilizing CO2 as a feedstock for organic and inorganic carbonates, urea and biodegradable polymers as well as non-conversion use of CO2 for example as a geothermal fluid, used in enhanced oil recovery and beverage making. The challenges of CCS are; high cost of capture transport and injection, environmental and safety, subsurface uncertainty, legal and regulatory issues. Trappings contribute to storage of CO2 in a site. They include; Structural and stratigraphic, residual, solubility, mineral trappings. In conclusion, an approach that integrates different methods of capture and storage of CO2 may be a practical solution for CCS.

To address these problems, firstly, the EEMD-LSTM-SVR algorithm is proposed to forecast wind power in the Belgian grid in order to tackle the uncertainty and strong volatility of wind power. Furthermore, the conventional thermal power plant is transformed into an integrated carbon capture power plant containing split-flow and liquid storage type, and the low-carbon mechanism of the two approaches is adequately discussed to give the low-carbon realization mechanism of the power system. Secondly, the mathematical model of EEMD-LSTM-SVR algorithm and the integrated low-carbon economic dispatch model are constructed. Finally, the simulation is verified in a modified IEEE-39 node system with carbon capture power plant. Compared with conventional thermal power plants, the carbon emissions of integrated carbon capture plants will be reduced by 78.248%; the abandoned wind of split carbon capture plants is reduced by 53.525%; the total cost of wind power for dispatch predicted using the EEMD-LSTM-SVR algorithm will be closer to the actual situation, with a difference of only USD 60.

A prominent policy promoting investment in renewable technologies is the use of feed-in tariffs, which has worked well at large scale in e.g. Germany, but which has only been implemented in a very limited way in countries such as the UK. Being subject to environmental uncertainties, however, renewables cannot be seen in isolation: while renewables-based technologies such as wind and solar energy, for example, suffer from uncertain loads depending on environmental conditions, hydropower allows for the storage of water for release at peak prices, which can be treated as a premium (partially) offsetting higher up-front investment costs.

The f3 Centre is a nationwide centre, which through cooperation and a systems approach contributes to the development of sustainable fossil-free fuels for transportation. The centre is financed by the Swedish Energy Agency, the Region V\u00e4stra G\u00f6taland and the f3 Partners, including universities, research institutes, and industry (see www.f3centre.se). The report includes a comparison of three scenarios for converting farm-produced biogas to vehicle fuel quality gas including conventional upgrading and transport in pressurized vessels and two future-oriented scenarios based on formation, transport and dissociation of gas hydrates. (2013) Hydrate for transport and storage of biogas and biomethane \u2013 A scenario study. The biogas potential in manure from Swedish agriculture is estimated to 4-6 TWh year-1. A general problem for biogas of vehicle fuel grade is cost-and energy efficient transportation and storage. One potential option could be to convert the biogas to gas hydrate, for further transport and upgrading to e.g. vehicle gas in a large scale. Gas hydrates (clathrates) are ice-like crystals formed under low temperature and high pressure with a potential to contain 164 m 3 gas m-3 of hydrate. Small gas molecules, such as hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide (CO 2) are captured in cages of hydrogen-bonded water molecules. The gas hydrates are stable and can be stored at atmospheric pressure at a regular freezing temperature of-17\u00b0C. To retain the methane gas (CH 4) from the hydrate, thermal dissociation is a common procedure. The aim of the present work was to compare three scenarios for converting farm-produced biogas to vehicle fuel quality gas including conventional upgrading and transport in pressurized vessels and two novel scenarios based on formation, transport and dissociation of gas hydrates. The energy use and global warming potential (GWP) was evaluated using a life cycle perspective. Possible constraints when implementing the novel systems in practice were identified and the costs for the system were estimated. The assessment was based on an assumed farm-scale biogas plant representing a typical biogas composition for manure-based digestion. In the reference scenario (CBG; compressed biogas), raw biogas was upgraded and compressed to reach vehicle fuel quality at the biogas plant, using conventional technology, before transportation in pressurized vessels to a centralized facility for storage and final use.

The aim is now to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gasses in the second half of this century. The challenge ahead is tremendous as 81% of our energy production is still based on fossil fuels. If we account for all hydrocarbons, that is, add bioenergy and waste to the above, the share of energy causing CO2 emissions is actually 91%. Turning our carbon-based energy system into carbon-free clean energy will require a major socio-technical transition and paradigm shift, which affects not only the technology side of energy but also business models and institutions, among others. Clean technologies will play a central role in this transition. Climate change mitigation will not be successful without an energy technology revolution. Indeed, major scenarios of the future energy system, such as those by the International Energy Agency [2] or Shell, clearly indicate that the new energy technologies, into which category I account here renewables and energy efficiency, are the winners in the technology race. For example, in the IEA 2015 technology perspective, ~70% of the technology measures by 2050 fall into this category. Shell estimated in its New Lens scenario that solar energy alone could meet close to 40% of all world energy by 2100. Nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage seem to play a minor role in the energy transition ahead. The rapid drop in the cost of new energy, notably wind and solar energy, has boosted their markets. For example, in Europe, some 80% of the capacity additions in power production in recent years have come from renewable energy, in particular solar and wind. Not only in Europe but also in Asia and North America we see the same kind of transition to take off, spreading even elsewhere. I recommend keeping watch on China in particular, as the country is leapfrogging in clean energy and may soon not only deliver cheap clean energy solutions for global demand but also acquire leadership in climate change mitigation. For example, Chinese photovoltaics modules are expected to cost $0.3Wp 1 in 2017, which may bring the cost of PV systems down to $1Wp 1 meaning a cost-parity on a global scale. When clean new energy is cheaper than the dirty old one, that is when the true market penetration will start, which leads to the big change in energy. Flipping the energy systems from 80% old to 80+%, new technologies may sound straightforward when just accounting for the joules, but in terms on how the energy system will function when fuel-based energy is replaced with fuel-less intermittent sources such as solar, wind, or marine energy is all but trivial. I firmly think that the question how we bridge the new and old energy, how well we are able to integrate the new energy technologies into the energy system, is the key technology challenge in front of us. If we do not pay enough attention to energy system integration, the shift may be more complicated and much costlier than anticipated. This means that we also need to focus on systemic innovations while moving toward a clean energy future. Although the forthcoming energy change sounds revolutionary, the transition itself is evolutionary and gradual in progress thus requiring coexistence of old and new technologies over half a century or even longer [3], emphasizing optimal integration of the new energy technologies into the energy system.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "93d42e68ff03e70c2c965e4fe5fa6373fef71d7c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2064104360", "DOI": "10.1021/JP031099+", "CorpusId": 96821293}, "title": "Oxidation of alkyl ions, CnH2n+1+ (n = 1-5), in reactions with O2 and O3 in the gas phase", "abstract": "Rate constants and product ion branching fractions are reported for the reactions of CH3+, C2H5+, s-C3H7+, s-C4H9+, t-C4H9+, and t-C5H11+ with O2 and O3 at 300 K in a variable-temperature selected-ion flow tube (VT-SIFT).

In particular nuclear power can be regarded as a competitor to coal CCS in electricity generation because it is also low in carbon and provides base-load electricity. Beyond the relevance of costs, we find that capture efficiency of fossil CCS technologies as well as the ability to control supply chain emissions of fossil fuels\u2014most notably methane emissions for coal mining or natural gas extraction\u2014are a crucial determinant for their deployment potential. This has important implications for choosing among different CCS technology routes, including post- and pre-combustion and oxyfuel technologies for power plants as they offer different perspectives for increasing capture efficiencies beyond the typically assumed 90%.

Four different biomass and a bituminous coal were used in air and 21, 30 and 40 % O2 atmospheres with balance of CO2. High speed video image analysis showed differences in ignition and devolatilization behaviour. The influence of particle size and mass on burnout times was higher in the coal, while biomass particle size can have a greater range of sizes for the same burnout times. The 30%O2 atmosphere was enough to have less burnout time than in air atmosphere for all the samples. During biomass particle combustion, the results showed that the surface tension on the biomass char particle plays a significant role due to partial melting of the char particle. This effect modifies the char particle shape during its combustion, with particles becoming more spherical particle even for those that initially had a fibrous shape. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

The team consists of scientists, engineers, lawyers, and business managers from academia, private industry, and State of Texas government from the following institutions: (1) Gulf Coast Carbon Center at the Bureau of Economic Geology (BEG), (2) Det Norske Veritas (USA) Inc (DNV), (3) Wood Group Mustang and sister company Wood Group Kenny (Wood Group), (4) Texas General Land Office (GLO), (5) Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (HRI), and (6) The University of Houston Law Center. Individual team members have expertise in carbon sequestration monitoring, CO2-pipeline design and construction, and domestic and international offshore environmental policy. The BMPs will be reviewed by external experts after it is generated and before being submitted to BOEM. The purpose of the BMPs will be to provide technical guidance to BOEM and BSEE (U.S. DOI Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement) to establish regulatory guidelines for offshore components of future U.S. Carbon Capture and Storage, which is sometimes referred to as sequestration, (CCS) industry. Sub-seabed geologic sequestration (GS) is the process whereby CO2 captured from large volume industrial sources (e.g., power plants, oil refineries) will be (1) compressed to supercritical state and transported via pipeline to offshore injection wells, and (2) injected into geologic strata deep (thousands of feet) below the seafloor. Objectives of the CO2 injection will be for \u201cpure sequestration\u201d (i.e., long-term storage of CO2 in subseafloor saline reservoirs) or sequestration combined with enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Sub-seabed geologic sequestration is very different from ocean dumping (i.e. dissolution of CO2 into circulating seawater) or injection of CO2 into deep water, shallow sub-seabed sediments. Some researchers proposed in the past that shallow subseafloor depths (<; 1,000 ft) were sufficient for permanent CO2 storage in deep marine environments (>; 11,000 ft water depth) (e.g., House et al., 2006). However, the shallow sedimentary subseafloor environment could become unstable and allow release of CO2 into ocean water, the end result of which would be ocean dumping. One mechanism of seafloor instability could be the release of gas from hydrates owing to pressure and temperature perturbations that may be introduced by shallow drilling and CO2 injection. Furthermore, the logistics of transporting CO2 hundreds of miles offshore to areas with sufficient water depths for storage in shallow subsea sediments would probably not be economically feasible. We want to emphasize that subseabed GS of CO2 is not ocean dumping. One of the biggest concerns for onshore GS is the potential to impact shallow drinking water resources. Injecting CO2 deep below the seafloor will avoid this potential consequence. But there are sensitive marine environments of concern in offshore settings, protection of which is critical. Environmental monitoring of marine ecosystems (nearshore, along CO2 pipeline corridors, and outer continental shelf) and subseafloor geological strata in which CO2 will be injected will be a large component of the BMPs. Topics being included in the BMPs, a draft of which will be submitted to BOEM in June of 2013, are: (1) site selection and characterization, (2) risk analysis, (3) project planning and execution, (4) environmental monitoring, (5) mitigation, (6) inspection and auditing, (7) reporting requirements, (8) emergency response and contingency planning, (9) decommissioning and site closure, and (10) legal issues. Where possible, we are using existing regulatory, policy, and technical guidance documents as a starting point for the BMPs. We think the most likely location for initiation of U.S. offshore geologic sequestration of CO2 will be in the western or central sectors of the Gulf of Mexico where extensive offshore oil and gas infrastructure already exists. Academic members of our project team are actively working on criteria for site selection [1].

GO is an atom-thick sheet of\ncarbon functionalized with several oxygen-containing groups\ndominated by the epoxy and hydroxyl functional groups on the basal\nplane, with carboxyls and lactols at the sheet edges. It is well\nknown that reduction of GO at temperatures > 150\u00b0C leads to the\nremoval of oxygen atoms from the carbon plane, leading to the\nformation of reduced GO (rGO) structures. Although GO has been\nutilized for multiple applications in the last decade, our\nunderstanding of the structure-property relationships at the\natomic-level has still been lacking owing to the amorphous nature\nand chemical inhomogeneity of GO, which has in turn limited our\nability to design and tailor GO nanostructures for high-performance\napplications. In particular, the material's structure and its\nstructural evolution at mild annealing temperatures (< 1000\u00b0C)\nhas been largely unexplored. In this thesis, we use a combination\nof first-principles computations, classical molecular dynamics\nsimulations based on reactive force fields and experiments to model\nrealistic GO structures and develop a detailed understanding of the\nrelationship between the carbon-oxygen framework and the sheet\nproperties, at the atomic level. Based on our understanding, we\ndemonstrate a new phase transformation in GO sheets at mild\nannealing temperatures (50-80\u00b0C), where the oxygen content is\npreserved and as-synthesized GO structures undergo a phase\nseparation into prominent oxidized and graphitic domains\nfacilitated by oxygen diffusion. Consequently, as-synthesized GO\nthat absorbs mainly in the ultraviolet region becomes strongly\nabsorbing in the visible region, photoluminescence is blue shifted\nand electronic conductivity increases by up to four orders of\nmagnitude. We then use this novel phase transformation to improve\ntwo sets of applications. 1) We demonstrate that cell capture\ndevices making use of phase transformed-GO substrates have higher\ncapture efficiencies compared to devices making use of\nas-synthesized GO substrates. 2) We show that the reduction of\nphase transformed-GO leads to better electrical properties of rGO\nthin films. Our results fill an important gap and establish a\ncomplete theory for structural evolution of GO over the entire\nrange of temperatures, i.e. from room temperature to ~1000\u00b0C. Taken\ntogether, this structural transition in GO enables us to predict\nand control the sheet properties in new ways, as opposed to\nreduction, which is till date the only handle to control the\nstructure of GO.

Previous studies on one such region \uf02d the Koue Bokkeveld, a high mountainous region at the source of three major drainage basins, demarcated for study purposes to cover nearly 2500 km, have failed to provide a comprehensive overview of such change and its landscape outcomes. This research aimed to detect, capture, record and classify the spatial nature, extent and change dynamics of various landscape elements and functions due to change in the land cover of this region. It assembled a comprehensive spatial database by digitising existing maps, aerial photograph mosaics and satellite imagery. Land cover maps were created for three historical and land cover change analyses were performed for the interim periods. Morphological landscape images were derived from a DEM and used to explain and interpret the location of land cover types and trends in change patterns. The effects on three landscape functions were determined, namely modelled run-off production, biodiversity deduced from landscape pattern structure and SANBI ratings, and carbon storage potential based on published figures. The research found that the regional landscape has undergone substantive land cover change , since the reference state. Increased intensity and productivity of agriculture and its related infrastructure increased its coverage to nearly 45 000 ha or 20 % of the total area. Perennial agriculture (nearly 10 000 ha of orchards and plantations) and annual (intensive vegetable growing and diminishing cereal crops) agriculture, accompanied by improved enabling infrastructure, such as irrigation technology (large storage dams, pipelines, micro delivery modes), transportation, roads, product cooling and packing plants, have extensively replaced natural vegetation. Located in valley bottoms and along toe-slope locations, where they compete for space directly with expanding and constantly intensifying agricultural activities, wetlands, shale fynbos and renosterveld face complete replacement. Land use and land cover changes have profoundly affected landscape functioning. Modelled rainfall run-off has increased (2% overall) in most subregions, opening possibilities for sedimentation and erosion. A high degree of fragmentation of the vulnerable and affected vegetation types threatens biodiversity. Increased carbon storage in perennial agriculture offers a benefit of change, as opposed to the negative outcomes on biodiversity of change in the Koue Bokkeveld. The research recommends improved institutional provision of the data required for system and regional modelling of processes like run-off in developing communities and for meeting the requirements of more sophisticated and accurate landscape models.

The focus of this work is to examine the impact of combusting biomass on the amines used to capture CO2 in a carbon capture plant. Biomass fuels were selected that are likely to be used by a BECCS power plant. These fuels were characterised to determine their fundamental composition and combusted under various conditions to examine the release of species volatile under combustion temperatures. Potassium is an element present in high quantities in biomass and highly volatile under combustion. A single particle combustion rig was employed to examine the release of potassium during biomass combustion and the impacts of an additive on potassium release were examined. Whilst combustion of biomass at different temperatures enabled an examination of the ashes which may encounter a carbon capture facility. \n \nBiomass and coal ashes were used to examine the effects on the degradation of 30 wt% w/w MEA in laboratory and pilot scale experiments. Solvent samples were analysed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the formation degradation products. This work characterised degradation products previously identified in literature and a degradation product that had not been previously identified, which is present in significant quantities. The analysis of laboratory and pilot scale results in this thesis suggest that carbon capture solvents are likely to encounter high quantities of potassium from biomass combustion. However the degradation of MEA, and thus the associated regeneration cost, may be less when carbon capture is used with biomass flue gases rather than coal.

It is mainly due to the industrial emissions and that could not be restricted owing to its importance in national development and the economy. Hence, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies in situ at industries will be a reasonable option. Microalgae have potentials and are promising in its application in sequestering CO directly from the flue gas. Microalgal carbon sequestration involves single-step CCS and reduces the technological and economic constraints associated with separate process for carbon capture and storage. They are also efficient in treating a wide variety of industrial wastewater and it provides a wonderful opportunity to utilize these wastewaters to cultivate microalgae and sequestering CO from the flue gas in the process. Successful amalgamation of microalgal carbon sequestration and wastewater treatment could be environmentally and economically sustainable method to produce algal biomass. The outcomes from this process will be that carbon emission from coal burning is reduced, the value-rich algal biomass produced could be utilized for production of various commercially important products and the treated wastewater be used for irrigation purposes or for another round of microalgal cultivation.

This stems from the lack of understanding of the effect of confinement on the fluids in the shale formations, which have nanometric pores, very low permeability and porosity. While primary methods of recovery provide suitable initial production rates, enhanced means of recovery using CO2 injection [1] may be required to sustain them. An enhanced process would provide both high extraction efficiencies of shale gas and serve as a means of CO2 storage in the depleted reservoir. In shale, natural gas (a mixture of methane and ethane) is held freely in pores and fractures as well as adsorbed within the micropores of the organic matter and clay minerals [2]. Understanding gas adsorption/desorption is key, as this dictates not only production rates, but it can also be used to provide estimates of the Gas-In-Place (GIP) at subsurface conditions. This investigation aims at using new laboratory observations to (i) quantify gas adsorption in shale at subsurface conditions, (ii) assess the pore-space properties of shale and their controls on sorption (particularly the role of organics and clay minerals) and (iii) make estimates of recoverable and storable gas. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) high-pressure adsorption isotherms have been measured using a Rubotherm Magnetic Suspension Balance over a wide range of conditions, i.e. temperatures in the range 283-353K and in the pressure range of 0-300 bar. A selection of shale samples from the Bowland formation in the UK has been used and results are compared to data measured at the same conditions on a mesoporous carbon, which serves as an analogue for the organic matter in shale. The shale samples have also been characterised by cryogenic low-pressure (<1 bar) physisorption methods including N2 at 77K and CO2 at 273K and 298K to obtain structural information of the material and key model parameters, such as the Henry constants. This comprehensive data set is used to identify useful guidelines with regards to the effect of the shale composition (i.e. clay and organic content) on properties such as specific surface area, pore volume and pore size distribution. Notably, we observe that the organic content of the shale can be used to scale adsorption isotherms measured on the mesoporous carbon, thus confirming that (i) shales are largely mesoporous and that (ii) organics play a major role in driving adsorption in shale. If this observation were to be of general validity, it could prove to be very useful in capturing the (inherent) variability in the adsorption properties of shale at the laboratory scale. Moreover, we have measured a significant adsorption selectivity of shale towards CO2 as compared to CH4, thus providing an opportunity to exploit the adsorption/desorption process to further enhance gas production and store CO2.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "8774498f1e0cbcc4377c7b8f5a1f5b1c85d01acf", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 212684273}, "title": "Integrated infrastructure for CO 2 transport and storage in the west Mediterranean Reporting Project information Final Report Summary-COMET ( Integrated infrastructure for CO 2 transport and storage in the west Mediterranean )", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide Capture, Transport and Storage (CCS) is an important component of a portfolio of low-carbon technologies, as it is able to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions substantially from both the energy sector and industry.

The Vertical Combustor Research Facility (VCRF) was built in 1994 and is CANMET\u2019s most modern pilot facility for combustion research. The facility is capable of firing pulverized coal and or natural gas using air or oxygen. It is one of the few research facilities operating in the world that can fire pulverized coal in a mixture of recycled flue gases and oxygen in order to simulate O2/CO2 combustion techniques. These combustion techniques can be used to enrich the concentration of CO2 in the products of combustion of fossil-fueled power plants in order to facilitate the capture of CO2 for use and or sequestration.

This effort began in 1993 with the planning and construction of a unique pilot scale facility located at CANMET\u2019s facilities in Ottawa, Canada. The Vertical Combustor Research Facility (VCRF) has been in continuous operation since it was commissioned in late 1994. This facility is capable of firing pulverised coal and/or natural gas under conditions approximating those found in industrial situations. The unit is capable of firing rates up to 0.3 MWth and features generous access provisions to probe the flame envelope. A pre-competitive research program arranged in co-operation with an international consortium of private and public sector partners has been the main mechanism used for operating the facility. The focus of this program has been to study the use of oxygen in the combustion of pulverized coal in order to enrich the CO2 content of the flue gases produced (Croiset et. al., 1998, Thambimuthu et. al., 1998, Croiset et. al., 1999, Croiset et. al., 2000). This elegant combustion technique can produce flue gases approaching 98 % CO2 (by vol, dry basis) illustrating the potential of this combustion based approach to facilitate the recovery of CO2 for use and/or sequestration. A major element of the research program since 1997 has been to develop a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling capability to complement the pilot-scale experimental investigations. The opportunity to validate the CFD models with data from the facility assures that the predictive capabilities developed can be applied towards technology development and scale-up activities with confidence. Another major element of the research program since 1999 has been to develop a process modelling capability to better understand how oxy-fuel techniques can best be applied in retrofit situations (Zheng et. al., 2001, Singh et. al., 2001). In 2000 significant changes were made to the VCRF to study the integrated treatment of pollutants, which is highly complementary to the oxy-fuel investigations (Mortazavi et. al., 2001). This paper will describe the current configuration of the pilot scale combustion facility and provide an overview of the CFD activities to date. The existing burner operational envelope will be described and selected results will be used to explain the CFD modeling approach used to simulate the combustion within the VCRF. Finally, future research work in the area of oxy-fuel combustion will be described. 2.0 PILOT PLANT CONFIGURATION Figure 1 provides a schematic of the current pilot plant configuration. There are four major systems associated with the VCRF. They are the fuel delivery system, the combustion system, the flue gas treatment system and the instrumentation and control system, which are described briefly below. There are also several other systems of importance to the operation of the VCRF including: coal crushing, drying and blending facilities, on-site bulk vessels provided by Air Liquide Canada for the storage of oxygen and carbon dioxide and finally, a gas detection/alarm system for monitoring the environment within the building housing the VCRF. 2.1 Fuel Delivery System Crushed and dried coal is fed to a single pulverizer operated in batch mode to prepare approximately 12 hours worth of fuel. Ambient air is used to sweep the mill and entrain the pulverized product to an overhead storage silo. This silo feeds a loss-in-mass-feeder which is capable of maintaining a relatively steady flow of coal to an eductor assembly. Ambient air or carbon dioxide from the bulk storage vessel is used as the primary stream, depending on the experiment, to deliver the coal to the burner front. Recent modifications have been made to allow oxygen to be mixed into the primary stream in order to study what impact this oxygen has on NO formation in the near burner region; however this feature was not used for the work reported in this paper. 2.2 Combustion System The combustion takes place in a vertically down fired combustor that has an inside diameter of 60 cm and an overall length of 8.3 m. The combustor is refractory lined to conserve heat to provide a realistic time-temperature history for the burning particles of coal. The design of the combustor barrel is modular so that sections can be removed or added as necessary. Water cooled panels can be inserted in the lower sections to control the outlet flue gas temperature. A variety of access ports are provided along the length of the combustor to facilitate probing, especially within the flame region itself, as shown in Figure 2. Standard IFRF probes are used for measuring radiation and sampling for species such as O2, CO, CO2, NO, NO2 and SO2. A proprietary high velocity shielded thermocouple probe is used to measure gas temperatures up to 1700 C. This temperature probe has been shown to withstand the severe environment imposed by firing coal at the high flame temperatures associated with oxygen enriched firing. A single register, swirl stabilized burner developed at CANMET has been used for the work reported in this paper. This burner provides stable flames over a wide range of firing conditions and has been in constant service since the facility was commissioned. Figure 3 illustrates the arrangement of the burner. Note the primary stream is admitted to an annulus located within the inner diameter of the swirling secondary stream. The secondary stream comprises ambient air alone or in combination with carbon dioxide from the bulk storage vessel, nitrogen, oxygen or recycled flue gases. The amount of oxygen mixed into the secondary stream is limited to 28 % (dry volume basis) for safety reasons. Most operating scenarios require some oxygen to be admitted directly at the burner and this is accomplished by a series of holes arranged in the annulus located within the inner diameter of the primary stream. Natural gas is fired down the center of the burner and a small tertiary stream is provided for premixing the natural gas stream. The tertiary stream also provides a buffer between the gas and the oxygen stream to prevent excessive flame temperatures near the burner front. The resulting burner assembly does not require any water cooled parts. The swirl register is a movable block unit made of carbon steel. 2.3 Flue Gas Treatment System Recent modifications have been made to the flue gas system to study the integrated treatment of pollutants. The new equipment is arranged in parallel with the existing baghouse, and consists of a new five field electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and a Condensing Heat Exchanger\u00ae (CHX). The CHX was made available to CANMET in mid 2000 by McDermott Technologies Inc, and is similar to a unit located in their Alliance , Ohio research center. The CHX unit features Teflon coated gas side surfaces and is configured to inject liquid sorbents over the tubes to capture gaseous pollutants such as sulfur dioxide. The ESP is a custom designed unit supplied by McGill Airclean Corporation in January 2001. It features active control of two field groupings which will facilitate on-line optimization for fine particulate capture. The flue gas recirculation system has recently been modified to eliminate bottlenecks limiting the throughput and to simplify the fan arrangement. The dedicated recirculation fan has been eliminated and the flue gas recirculation stream is now taken from downstream of the induced draft (ID) fan. The ID fan now operates against a control valve to generate the pressure required by the recirculation system. The ID fan has also been provided with a variable frequency drive for better control. 2.4 Instrumentation and Controls The main burner fires into a refractory quarl which incorporates a natural gas fired ignitor. This ignitor is monitored using an ultraviolet scanner. The coal flame is monitored using an infrared scanner. The VCRF is provided with three Continuous Emissions Monitoring (CEM) systems to monitor conditions at the mixing plenum before the burner, the combustor exit and the ID fan inlet. Species measured include O2, CO, CO2, SO2, NO and NO2. An in-situ oxygen cell is used to ensure the oxygen content of the secondary stream is kept below 28 % (dry volume basis) for safety reasons. System control and data acquisition is provided by a Honeywell series 9000 PLC with a dedicated PC supervisor.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "65e99b2449c15fe09407cc4d2f7571573c9de79d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3165913052", "DOI": "10.3390/RESOURCES10060061", "CorpusId": 236258324}, "title": "CC(U)S Initiatives: Public Effects and \u201cCombined Value\u201d Performance", "abstract": "The changes in climate, which are associated with the emission of anthropogenic greenhouse gases, have been widely discussed by scientists and specialists during the last few decades.

One method of achieving this is through Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Geological structures that lie offshore under continental shelf seas offer huge CCS storage potential. An emerging marine industry is developing to exploit this potential and national marine monitoring agencies will soon need to consider the potential impacts of this emerging industry. This review of published literature is aimed at generalists responsible for the delivery of national marine monitoring, as well as those involved in the management of the marine environment. It briefly summarizes why the emerging offshore CCS industry is needed, how large it may be and what marine infrastructure may be involved. For the purposes of this paper, a hypothetical 20 Mtpa industry has been used to gauge the potential impact of a developing offshore CCS industry. The probability of CO2 leaks from such an industry is low. If they do occur, the spatial scale of impact will be small, and the potential environmental impacts will be low. Irrespective of how CO2 is transported or stored within shelf seas, leaked CO2 will enter the sea as a gas or as a solution dissolved in sediment pore water. CO2 as a gas will dissolve into seawater and/or directly vent to the atmosphere, depending on the initial conditions of the leak. The most probable source of leaks in a developed CCS industry is from pipelines (currently a 2-year event per 1000 km pipeline). The most probable source of leakage from geological storage is through abandoned wells (a 20- to 80-year event for a 20 Mtpa industry). The source of leaks from a CCS scheme with the potential to release the greatest mass of CO2 is through geological faults, as these may go undetected (if they occur) for long periods. The probability of leaks from geological storage, through faults or abandoned wells, is site dependent and minimized by the site selection process.

We use the JULES land surface model coupled to an inverted form of the IMOGEN climate emulator to investigate mitigation scenarios that achieve the 1.5 or 2 C warming targets of the Paris Agreement. Specifically, within this IMOGEN-JULES framework, we focus on and characterise the global and regional effectiveness of land-based (BECCS and/or AR) and anthropogenic methane (CH4) emission mitigation, separately and in combination, on the anthropogenic fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) emission budgets (AFFEBs) to 2100. We use consistent data and socio-economic assumptions from the IMAGE integrated assessment model for the second Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2). The analysis includes the effects of the methane and carbon\u2013climate feedbacks from wetlands and permafrost thaw, which we have shown previously to be significant constraints on the AFFEBs. Globally, mitigation of anthropogenic CH4 emissions has large impacts on the anthropogenic fossil fuel emission budgets, potentially offsetting (i.e. allowing extra) carbon dioxide emissions of 188\u2013212 Gt C. This is because of (a) the reduction in the direct and indirect radiative forcing of methane in response to the lower emissions and hence atmospheric concentration of methane and (b) carbon-cycle changes leading to increased uptake by the land and ocean by CO2-based fertilisation. Methane mitigation is beneficial everywhere, particularly for the major CH4-emitting regions of India, the USA, and China.

However, one of the main byproducts from consuming fossil fuels is CO2, a greenhouse gas that can cause climate change and ultimately threaten the survival of humanity. An alarming statistic published in 2008 shows that a nearly 40% of 5.8 billion metric tons of the total US anthropogenic CO2 emissions was resulted from burning fossil fuels for power generation [1]. Therefore, to effectively mitigate CO2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels has drawn a great deal of attentions in recent years at all levels of our society. It has risen to be not only a scientific topic but also a political agenda. Among all the options available, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is regarded as the sole practical solution to achieve considerable CO2 emission reduction from fossil-fueled power plants in a near term [1]. To realize the ultimate CO2 storage, separation and capture of CO2 from a CO2-containing process stream is the first step. The CO2 capture technologies currently being developed and demonstrated are targeting at three different stages/processes depending on the type of a power plant: post-combustion, oxyfuel combustion and pre-combustion [2-3]. The existing state-of-the-art CO2 capture technologies are primarily based on chemical/ physical absorptions by a liquid solvent or a solid sorbent and are yet ready for commercialization at the larger scale necessary for power plant application. The parasitic loads (steam and power) required to support CO2 capture would decrease power generation capacity by nearly one-third and increase levelized cost-ofelectricity (COE) by as much as 80%. Even if successfully scaled up, it would not be cost effective at their current level of process development [1]. In contrast, membrane-based CO2 capture technology presents cost advantages when applied to preand postcombustion CO2 capture: no steam or chemical load, delivering high-pressure CO2 and driving CO shifting reaction to completion. However, the major challenges are the limited selectivity, thus product purity, and poor compatibility with high-temperature process stream. Therefore, developing an alternative high-temperature membrane technology to separate/capture CO2 more selectively and efficiently for existing power plants is in great need. One category of gas separation membranes that has the potential to meet these requirements is the mixed ionic and electronic conductors. An electrochemical transport membrane only allows the electrochemically active species to transport through the membrane. Therefore, its selectivity is exclusive. Since this membrane normally operates at elevated temperatures, it also has an excellent compatibility with any high-temperature process stream. The key feature of these materials is the concomitant fast ionic and electronic transport enabling high flux. Applying this principle to the CO2 separation membrane, two types of mixed conductors can be envisioned: 1) mixed carbonate-ion and oxide-ion conductor (MOCC); 2) mixed carbonate-ion and electron conductor (MECC). Fig. 1 shows the working principles of these two membranes along with CO2-separation enabling surface reactions. Based on these fundamental reactions, it is evident that MOCC is more suitable for CO2 separation from a reducing stream such as water-gas shift gas (CO2+H2) where the chemical gradients of CO2 and O2 exist in opposite direction across the membrane. On the other hand, MECC is more adequate for CO2 separation from an oxidizing stream such as flue gas (CO2, O2, N2) where the chemical gradients of CO2 and O2 exist in the same direction across the membrane. In this case, both CO2 and O2 will permeate through the membrane, the mixture of which can be further separated by a downstream OTM or recycled back to the combustion chamber for oxy-combustion [3].", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "938d729ef6f55d511ee500d600c18de6915af4fd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2953130492", "DOI": "10.1002/CHIN.201128008", "CorpusId": 197332617}, "title": "The Influence of SO2 and NO2 Impurities on CO2 Gas Hydrate Formation and Stability.", "abstract": "In an attempt to provide data concerning the industrial carbon capture and storage in gas hydrate reservoirs under real conditions, the influence of small amounts of SO2 and NO2 impurities on CO2 hydrate formation, behavior, and stability is investigated by Raman spectroscopy, DSC, and XRD.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "20a893ef628bcc59cbaea354688413129be0e6ee", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2071936133", "DOI": "10.1115/OMAE2011-49812", "CorpusId": 110884580}, "title": "Conceptual Design of Navigation of an AUV for Monitoring CCS Site at Deep Sea Bottom", "abstract": "We, Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), are developing an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) whose main mission is monitoring a site at the sea bottom for the carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). The AUV cruises very near the sea bottom, and is equipped with chemical sensors in order to detect escape of CO2 from sub-bottom. Of course, the position information of the AUV is critical information for the monitoring. In this paper, a conceptual design of navigation of the AUV is described. Recently, navigation of AUV is implemented by integrating multiple navigation devices including inertial navigation system (INS), Doppler velocity log (DVL), depth sensor, acoustic navigation system, and others. The AUV under construction will be equipped with these navigation sensors, and will integrate those sensors\u2019 outputs to navigate herself. In order to measure the absolute position of the AUV the acoustic method is one of fundamental technique. At the first step of development of the AUV, three acoustic methods are considered to adopt. The three methods are super short baseline (SSBL) method which is a tracking from support ship or other surface station, long baseline (LBL) which is navigation based on preplaced acoustic transponders, and virtual LBL (VLBL) which is navigation based on only single transponder. These acoustic methods are integrated with the navigation result of INS, depth sensor, and DVL. The three methods are used in each appropriate case. Which feature of observation is desired simplicity, accuracy, or independence from support ship and time efficiency? The acoustic method is influenced by environment, and also output of other sensors is depending on the environment, for example the DVL miss the data when the terrain is with many up-hills and down-hills. The integration or filtering parameters of the navigation should be adjusted depending on the influential environmental factor.Copyright \u00a9 2011 by ASME", "year": 2011}]}
