Chemistry's ability to get more from less is epitomized by porous coordination polymers, also known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which use a minimum amount of material to build maximum surface areas with fine control over pore size. Their large specific surface area and tunable porosity make MOFs useful for applications including small-molecule sensing, separation, catalysis, and storage and release of molecules of interest. Proof-of-concept projects have demonstrated their potential for environmental applications such as carbon separation and capture, water purification, carcinogen sequestration, byproduct separation, and resource recovery. To translate these from the laboratory into devices for actual use, however, will require synthesis of MOFs with new functionality and structure. This Account summarizes recent progress in the use of nano- and microparticles to control the function, location, and 3D structure of MOFs during MOF self-assembly, creating novel, hybrid, multifunctional, ultraporous materials as a first step towards creating MOF-based devices. The use of preformed ceramic, metallic, semiconductive, or polymeric particles allows the particle preparation process to be completely independent of the MOF synthesis, incorporating nucleating, luminescent, magnetic, catalytic, or templating particles into the MOF structure. We discuss success in combining functional nanoparticles and porous crystals for applications including molecular sieve detectors, repositionable and highly sensitive sensors, pollutant-sequestering materials, microfluidic microcarriers, drug-delivery materials, separators, and size-selective catalysts. In sections within the Account, we describe how functional particles can be used for (1) heterogeneous nucleation (seeding) of MOFs, (2) preparation of framework composites with novel properties, (3) MOF positioning on a substrate (patterning), and (4) synthesis of MOFs with novel architectures.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "869d05e59f00834560a560c06b892f496e71b206", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2171259934", "DOI": "10.1039/c3cc48747d", "CorpusId": 205846656, "PubMed": "24382488"}, "title": "A highly porous NbO type metal-organic framework constructed from an expanded tetracarboxylate.", "abstract": "A novel NbO type microporous metal\u2013organic framework Cu2L (ZJU-32; H4L = 5'-((3,5-dicarboxyphenyl)ethynyl)-[1,1':3',1\"-terphenyl]-4,4\"-dicarboxylic acid) constructed from an elaborately designed tetratopic ligand was solvothermally synthesized and structurally characterized.

We present a Life Cycle Assessment of coal-fired electricity generation that compares monoethanolamine (MEA)-based postcombustion capture (PCC) of CO2 with distributed, humidity-swing-based direct air capture (HS-DAC). Given suitable temperature, humidity, wind, and water availability, HS-DAC can be largely passive. Comparing energy requirements of HS-DAC and MEA-PCC, we find that the parasitic load of HS-DAC is less than twice that of MEA-PCC (60-72 kJ/mol versus 33-46 kJ/mol, respectively). We also compare other environmental impacts as a function of net greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation: To achieve the same 73% mitigation as MEA-PCC, HS-DAC would increase nine other environmental impacts by on average 38%, whereas MEA-PCC would increase them by 31%. Powering distributed HS-DAC with photovoltaics (instead of coal) while including recapture of all background GHG, reduces this increase to 18%, hypothetically enabling coal-based electricity with net-zero life-cycle GHG.

On the other hand, geological storage in deep saline aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs of large amounts of CO2, captured from large stationary sources is one method that is under consideration for reducing greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere on a worldwide basis. In both cases of CO2-EOR and CO2 capture and geological storage (CCGS), the containment of CO2 within the injection unit and leakage avoidance are essential. Effective CO2 containment is achieved by the overlying tight caprock that is initially highly saturated with formation brine, which prevents CO2 migration into uphole intervals and potentially into shallow freshwater aquifers and ultimately to the atmosphere. The confining properties of the caprock are due to its very low permeability and to relative permeability and capillary pressure effects that prevent the penetration of CO2 into, and significant flow through the caprock. Essential to the assessment of CO2-EOR and CCGS operations, including numerical simulation, is knowledge about the caprock permeability to brine and CO2. This paper presents results of detailed measurements at full reservoir conditions for permeability to water, primary drainage and secondary imbibition permeability, relative permeability and trapped saturation of supercritical, densephase CO2 and brine for three different, regionally-extensive low permeability formations in the Alberta basin, Canada.

We find that temperate broadleaf forest growth and biomass in southern New England increase substantially from forest interior to edge. However, forest growth reductions with climate stress increase with proximity to the edge, pointing to important interactions between forest fragmentation and climate change. We show that, by not accounting for edge effects, current approaches to quantifying regional and global carbon balance may underestimate carbon sequestration and not accurately represent forest growth response to future climate change. Forest fragmentation is a ubiquitous, ongoing global phenomenon with profound impacts on the growing conditions of the world\u2019s remaining forest. The temperate broadleaf forest makes a large contribution to the global terrestrial carbon sink but is also the most heavily fragmented forest biome in the world. We use field measurements and geospatial analyses to characterize carbon dynamics in temperate broadleaf forest fragments. We show that forest growth and biomass increase by 89 \u00b1 17% and 64 \u00b1 12%, respectively, from the forest interior to edge, but ecosystem edge enhancements are not currently captured by models or approaches to quantifying regional C balance. To the extent that the findings from our research represent the forest of southern New England in the United States, we provide a preliminary estimate that edge growth enhancement could increase estimates of the region\u2019s carbon uptake and storage by 13 \u00b1 3% and 10 \u00b1 1%, respectively. However, we also find that forest growth near the edge declines three times faster than that in the interior in response to heat stress during the growing season. Using climate projections, we show that future heat stress could reduce the forest edge growth enhancement by one-third by the end of the century. These findings contrast studies of edge effects in the world\u2019s other major forest biomes and indicate that the strength of the temperate broadleaf forest carbon sink and its capacity to mitigate anthropogenic carbon emissions may be stronger, but also more sensitive to climate change than previous estimates suggest.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "191bd9fda2068b5fded473d26b3496d245efbddd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2811133697", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aas9793", "CorpusId": 206666797, "PubMed": "29954954"}, "title": "Net-zero emissions energy systems", "abstract": "Path to zero carbon emissions Models show that to avert dangerous levels of climate change, global carbon dioxide emissions must fall to zero later this century. Most of these emissions arise from energy use. Davis et al. review what it would take to achieve decarbonization of the energy system. Some parts of the energy system are particularly difficult to decarbonize, including aviation, long-distance transport, steel and cement production, and provision of a reliable electricity supply. Current technologies and pathways show promise, but integration of now-discrete energy sectors and industrial processes is vital to achieve minimal emissions. Science, this issue p. eaas9793 BACKGROUND Net emissions of CO2 by human activities\u2014including not only energy services and industrial production but also land use and agriculture\u2014must approach zero in order to stabilize global mean temperature. Energy services such as light-duty transportation, heating, cooling, and lighting may be relatively straightforward to decarbonize by electrifying and generating electricity from variable renewable energy sources (such as wind and solar) and dispatchable (\u201con-demand\u201d) nonrenewable sources (including nuclear energy and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage). However, other energy services essential to modern civilization entail emissions that are likely to be more difficult to fully eliminate. These difficult-to-decarbonize energy services include aviation, long-distance transport, and shipping; production of carbon-intensive structural materials such as steel and cement; and provision of a reliable electricity supply that meets varying demand. Moreover, demand for such services and products is projected to increase substantially over this century. The long-lived infrastructure built today, for better or worse, will shape the future. Here, we review the special challenges associated with an energy system that does not add any CO2 to the atmosphere (a net-zero emissions energy system). We discuss prominent technological opportunities and barriers for eliminating and/or managing emissions related to the difficult-to-decarbonize services; pitfalls in which near-term actions may make it more difficult or costly to achieve the net-zero emissions goal; and critical areas for research, development, demonstration, and deployment. It may take decades to research, develop, and deploy these new technologies. ADVANCES A successful transition to a future net-zero emissions energy system is likely to depend on vast amounts of inexpensive, emissions-free electricity; mechanisms to quickly and cheaply balance large and uncertain time-varying differences between demand and electricity generation; electrified substitutes for most fuel-using devices; alternative materials and manufacturing processes for structural materials; and carbon-neutral fuels for the parts of the economy that are not easily electrified. Recycling and removal of carbon from the atmosphere (carbon management) is also likely to be an important activity of any net-zero emissions energy system. The specific technologies that will be favored in future marketplaces are largely uncertain, but only a finite number of technology choices exist today for each functional role. To take appropriate actions in the near term, it is imperative to clearly identify desired end points. To achieve a robust, reliable, and affordable net-zero emissions energy system later this century, efforts to research, develop, demonstrate, and deploy those candidate technologies must start now. OUTLOOK Combinations of known technologies could eliminate emissions related to all essential energy services and processes, but substantial increases in costs are an immediate barrier to avoiding emissions in each category. In some cases, innovation and deployment can be expected to reduce costs and create new options. More rapid changes may depend on coordinating operations across energy and industry sectors, which could help boost utilization rates of capital-intensive assets, but this will require overcoming institutional and organizational challenges in order to create new markets and ensure cooperation among regulators and disparate, risk-averse businesses. Two parallel and broad streams of research and development could prove useful: research in technologies and approaches that can decarbonize provision of the most difficult-to-decarbonize energy services, and research in systems integration that would allow reliable and cost-effective provision of these services. A shower of molten metal in a steel foundry. Industrial processes such as steelmaking will be particularly challenging to decarbonize. Meeting future demand for such difficult-to-decarbonize energy services and industrial products without adding CO2 to the atmosphere may depend on technological cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries. Some energy services and industrial processes\u2014such as long-distance freight transport, air travel, highly reliable electricity, and steel and cement manufacturing\u2014are particularly difficult to provide without adding carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. Rapidly growing demand for these services, combined with long lead times for technology development and long lifetimes of energy infrastructure, make decarbonization of these services both essential and urgent. We examine barriers and opportunities associated with these difficult-to-decarbonize services and processes, including possible technological solutions and research and development priorities. A range of existing technologies could meet future demands for these services and processes without net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, but their use may depend on a combination of cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "3d77ae7a50df85947a471eb5f02b6c3276b9e5be", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2605994969", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2017.01.015", "CorpusId": 56144695}, "title": "The physical characteristics of a CO2 seeping fault: the implications of fracture permeability for carbon capture and storage integrity", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "a9c7d2efbb7110ff3c0ff27f75a7c466293ebf75", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2584754271", "CorpusId": 115028354}, "title": "Materials and energy : a story of linkages", "abstract": "Human society has always depended on a substantial input of materials.

At the same time as in countries with moderate opposition, such as Norway or Finland, risk perceptions are more connected with the risk for investment. We also conclude that the strongest polarization in risk perceptions is among NGOs in different countries, followed by scientists.

In addition, the carbonate chemistry of many marine systems is now being observed to be more variable than previously thought. To underpin more robust projections of future OA impacts on marine biomineralisers and their role in ecosystem service provision, we investigate coralline algal responses to realistically variable scenarios of marine pCO2 enrichment. Coralline algae are important in ecosystem function; providing habitats and nursery areas, hosting high biodiversity, stabilizing reef structures and contributing to the carbon cycle. Red coralline marine algae were exposed for 80 days to one of three pH treatments: (i) current pH (control); (ii) low pH (7.7) representing OA change; and (iii) an abrupt drop to low pH (7.7) representing the higher rates of pH change observed at natural vent systems, in areas of upwelling and during CCS releases. We demonstrate that red coralline algae respond differently to the rate and the magnitude of pH change induced by pCO2 enrichment. At low pH, coralline algae survived by increasing their calcification rates. However, when the change to low pH occurred at a fast rate we detected, using Raman spectroscopy, weaknesses in the calcite skeleton, with evidence of dissolution and molecular positional disorder. This suggests that, while coralline algae will continue to calcify, they may be structurally weakened, putting at risk the ecosystem services they provide.

The capture of CO 2 from industrial flue gases has become an important issue in recent years. The threat of climate change from increased levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere is significant. Mean global temperatures are on the rise and various regions of the world have been experiencing adverse climate issues. For example, polar ice caps are melting at an alarming rate, heat waves and droughts are becoming commonplace and the occurrence of violent weather has increased around the globe. Therefore, the need for research and development of cost-effective CO 2 capture technologies is urgent. Energy-related activities accounted for 81% of total GHG emissions in Canada in 2008 and large stationary sources accounted for over 46% of total GHG emissions (as indicated in Canada\u2019s 2008 Greenhouse Gas Inventory [101]. It is worthy to note that CO 2 accounts for 78.2% of Canada\u2019s total GHG emissions. In addition, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA) World Energy Outlook (2009) predictions, worldwide energy-related CO 2 emissions will reach 40.2 gigatons by 2030 (which is correlated with a 6\u00b0C increase in global temperature) unless strong efforts are made to achieve the newly agreed upon target of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations at 450 ppm CO 2 equivalent. In the IEA\u2019s 450 Scenario, which represents the projected outcomes if GHG emissions are limited to 450 ppm CO 2 equivalent, implementation of technologies such as carbon capture and storage before 2015 is critical to meeting the necessary emissions targets. Since coal is relatively inexpensive and exists in abundant quantities around the world, it is likely that it will remain the fuel of choice at thermal power stations for decades to come. If CO 2 emission rates at these facilities can be reduced in a cost-effective manner, the anthropogenic contribution to global warming will be minimized. Carbon-capture and storage (CCS) is expected to contribute nearly 20% of global GHG emission reductions by mid-century.

We, for the first time, report an economical and environmentally benign strategy to reduce sintering by adding fly ash, a waste stream of coal-fired plants, into Ca-based sorbents through a simple dry process. The as-synthesized sorbents were tested using a TGA and showed an extremely high stability under the most severe multi-cycle conditions (calcined at 920 \u00b0C in pure CO2). Upon 100 cycles, its CO2 capture capacity was 0.20 g(CO2) g(sorbent)\u22121, and the average deactivation rate was only 0.18% per cycle. The most possible stabilization mechanism was discussed on the basis of a range of characterizations including N2 physisorption, SEM, TEM (coupled with EDX mapping) and XRD; it was concluded that stable and refractory gehlenite (Ca2Al2SiO7) particles were formed and evenly dispersed around CaO crystal grains during calcination at 950 \u00b0C, leading to sintering resistance.

According to the integrated assessment models (IAMs) used to produce mitigation scenarios for the IPCC reports, the NET with the greatest potential to achieve negative emissions is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Crucial questions arise about where the enormous quantities of biomass needed according to the IAM scenarios could feasibly be produced in a sustainable manner. Africa is attractive in the context of BECCS because of large areas that could contribute biomass energy and indications of substantial underground CO2 storage capacities. However, estimates of large biomass availability in Africa are usually based on highly aggregated datasets, and only a few studies explore future challenges or barriers for BECCS in any detail. Based on previous research and literature, this paper analyses the pre-conditions for BECCS in Tanzania by studying what we argue are the applications of BECCS, or the components of the BECCS chain, that are most feasible in the country, namely (1) as applied to domestic sugarcane-based energy production (bioethanol), and (2) with Tanzania in a producer and re-growth role in an international BECCS chain, supplying biomass or biofuels for export to developed countries. The review reveals that a prerequisite for both options is either the existence of a functional market for emissions trading and selling, making negative emissions a viable commercial investment, or sustained investment through aid programmes. Also, historically, an important barrier to the development of production capacity of liquid biofuels for export purposes has been given by ethical dilemmas following in the wake of demand for land to facilitate production of biomass, such as sugarcane and jatropha. In these cases, conflicts over access to land and mismanagement have been more of a rule than an exception. Increased production volumes of solid biomass for export to operations that demand bioenergy, be it with or without a CCS component, is likely to give rise to similar conflicts. While BECCS may well play an important role in reducing emissions in countries with high capacity to act combined with existing large point sources of biogenic CO2 emissions, it seems prudent to proceed with utmost caution when implicating BECCS deployment in least developed countries, like Tanzania.The paper argues that negative BECCS-related emissions from Tanzania should not be assumed in global climate mitigation scenarios.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "912435faabad25cdc30897532c8e47a589ab7698", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2324294392", "DOI": "10.1021/EF101218A", "CorpusId": 102237760}, "title": "Biomimetic Sequestration of CO2 and Reformation to CaCO3 Using Bovine Carbonic Anhydrase Immobilized on SBA-15", "abstract": "The biocatalytic capture of CO2, and its precipitation as CaCO3, over bovine carbonic anhydrase (BCA) immobilized on a pore-expanded SBA-15 support was investigated.

It is possible to reach a 70% reduction in CO2 emissions through a combination of demand-side and supply-side actions. On the demand side, reductions of 40\u201345% are possible through efficiency improvements, decreased population and the more rational use of energy despite increased energy demands arising in certain sectors.

The second role arises because of the storage mechanism for gas in coal. Unlike CO 2 -enhanced oil recovery processes, CO 2 injected during ECBM recovery is strongly adsorbed onto the coal, and in a relatively homogeneous reservoir is not expected to break through to the production wells until the bulk of the coalbed methane (CBM) reservoir is swept of methane. This provides a huge CO 2 storage potential in coalbeds throughout the world. However, based on current economic factors, it makes more sense to partially deplete the coal reservoir of methane before injecting CO 2 , The exact strategy depends on two economic factors, the costs and credits for sequestration of CO 2 and the natural gas sales price. CO 2 credits would have a major effect on the production strategy used for CBM, and would favor early use of ECBM.

However, a method which can directly capture and mineralize CO2 at a point source, under actual field conditions, has advantages and could help offset the cost associated with the conventional CCS technologies. The mineral carbonation (MC), a process of converting CO2 into stable minerals (mineralization), has been studied extensively to store CO2. However, most of the MC studies have been largely investigated at laboratory scale. Objectives of this research were to develop a pilot scale AMC (accelerated mineral carbonation) process and test the effects of flue gas moisture content on carbonation of fly ash particles. A pilot scale AMC process consisting of a moisture reducing drum (MRD), a heater/humidifier, and a fluidized-bed reactor (FBR) was developed and tested by reacting flue gas with fly ash particles at one of the largest coal-fired power plants (2120 MW) in the USA. The experiments were conducted over a period of 2 hr at ~ 300 SCFM flow-rates, at a controlled pressure (115.1 kPa), and under different flue gas moisture contents (2-16%). The flue gas CO2 and SO2 concentrations were monitored before and during the experiments by an industrial grade gas analyzer. Fly ash samples were collected from the reactor sample port from 0-120 minutes and analyzed for total inorganic carbon (C), sulfur (S), and mercury (Hg). From C, S, and Hg concentrations, %calcium carbonate (CaCO3), %sulfate (SO42-), and %mercury carbonate (HgCO3) were calculated, respectively. Results suggested significant mineralization of flue gas CO2, SO2, and Hg within 10-15 minutes of reaction. Among different moisture conditions, ~16% showed highest conversion of flue gas CO2 and SO2 to %CaCO3 and %SO42- in fly ash samples. For example, an increase of almost 4% in CaCO3 content of fly ash was observed. Overall, the AMC process is cost-effective with minimum carbon footprint and can be retrofitted to coal fired power plants (existing and/or new) as a post-combustion unit to minimize flue gas CO2, SO2, and Hg emissions into the atmosphere. Used in conjunction with capture and geologic sequestration, the AMC process has the potential to reduce overall cost associated with CO2 separation/compression/transportation/pore space/brine water treatment.

Mitigating climate change will require a suite of actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a new technology aimed at mitigating climate change by capturing and storing carbon dioxide, typically in deep geological reservoirs. CCS has risks characteristic of new technologies, as well as risks unique to this technology and its application. Large-scale CCS decision making is complex, encompassing environmental, social, and economic considerations and requiring the risks to be taken into consideration. CCS projects have been cancelled as a result of inadequate assessments of risks. To date, studies assessing CCS have been limited mostly to environmental, social, and economic fields in isolation from each other, predominantly using life cycle assessments (LCAs), cost benefit analyses (CBAs), or surveys of public perception. LCAs, CBAs, and surveys of public perception all have limitations for assessing difficult multifaceted problems. Incompatibilities across CCS assessment methods have hindered the comparison of the results across these single-discipline studies and limited the possibility of drawing broader conclusions about CCS development. More standardization across assessment methods, study assumptions, functional units, and assessment criteria for CCS could be beneficial to the integration of multiple study results. We propose a set of criteria, which decision analysts could use to develop CCS-project\u2013specific criteria lists in order to comprehensively assess a CCS project's viability.

In this paper we examine the role of a particular technology, carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), in the stabilization of the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). While CCS is not presently deployed at scale, it has the potential to deploy extensively during the course of the 21st century if concentrations of atmospheric CO2 are to be stabilized. The existing research literature has focused largely on the cost of capturing CO2, with the implicit assumption that storage options would be relatively cheap, plentiful and located in close proximity to future CO2 point sources. However, CO2 capture and storage will take place at the local and regional scale and will compete with other mitigation options that also exhibit local or regional differences. This paper provides an initial examination of the implications of regionally disaggregated demand for and supply of CO2 storage reservoirs within the context of a globally disaggregated, long-term analysis of both the geology and economics of CCS. This analysis suggests that some regions will see their ability to deploy CCS systems constrained by a lack of quality target reservoirs relative to the demand formore\u00a0\u00bb storage placed upon these candidate geologic storage reservoirs by large stationary CO2 point sources within the region. Other regions appear to have sufficient storage capacity to easily carry them into the 22nd century. We examined the regional and global economic implications of the distribution of these sources and sinks in meeting various potential limits to atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

However, the emission of methane could potentially offset the greenhouse gas benefits of captured carbon. As microbial communities play a key role in governing wetland greenhouse gas fluxes, we are interested in how microbial community composition and functions are associated with wetland hydrology, biogeochemistry, and methane emission, which is critical to modeling the microbial component in wetland methane fluxes and to managing restoration projects for maximal carbon sequestration. Here, we couple sequence-based methods with biogeochemical and greenhouse gas measurements to interrogate microbial communities from a pilot-scale restored wetland in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California, revealing considerable spatial heterogeneity even within this relatively small site. A number of microbial populations and functions showed strong correlations with electron acceptor availability and methane production; some also showed a preference for association with plant roots. Marker gene phylogenies revealed a diversity of major methane-producing and -consuming populations and suggested novel diversity within methanotrophs. Methanogenic archaea were observed in all samples, as were nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria, indicating that no single terminal electron acceptor was preferred despite differences in energetic favorability and suggesting spatial microheterogeneity and microniches. Notably, methanogens were negatively correlated with nitrate-, sulfate-, and metal-reducing bacteria and were most abundant at sampling sites with high peat accretion and low electron acceptor availability, where methane production was highest. IMPORTANCE Wetlands are the largest nonanthropogenic source of atmospheric methane but also a key global carbon reservoir. Characterizing belowground microbial communities that mediate carbon cycling in wetlands is critical to accurately predicting their responses to changes in land management and climate. Here, we studied a restored wetland and revealed substantial spatial heterogeneity in biogeochemistry, methane production, and microbial communities, largely associated with the wetland hydraulic design. We observed patterns in microbial community composition and functions correlated with biogeochemistry and methane production, including diverse microorganisms involved in methane production and consumption. We found that methanogenesis gene abundance is inversely correlated with genes from pathways exploiting other electron acceptors, yet the ubiquitous presence of genes from all these pathways suggests that diverse electron acceptors contribute to the energetic balance of the ecosystem. These investigations represent an important step toward effective management of wetlands to reduce methane flux to the atmosphere and enhance belowground carbon storage.

It involves capturing CO2 from large stationary sources and subsequently storing it in various reservoirs such as depleted oil or gas reservoirs, saline aquifers and deep unmineable coal seams. In this work, a finite-scenario based two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed for planning the retrofit of power plants with carbon capture (CC) technology and the subsequent CO2 source-sink matching in CCS supply chains under uncertainty. This model can be used to select appropriate sources, capture technologies and sinks and maximize the amount of captured and stored CO2 under the presence of uncertainty.

However, successful implementation of geologic storage projects will require robust monitoring, verification, and accounting (MVA) tools. This article deals with all aspects of MVA activities associated with such geologic CO2 storage projects, including site characterization, CO2 plume tracking, CO2 flow rate and injection pressure monitoring, leak detection, cap-rock integrity analysis, and long-term postinjection monitoring. Improved detailed decision tree diagrams are presented covering the five stages of a geologic storage project. These diagrams provide guidance from the point of site selection through construction and operations to closure and postclosure monitoring. Monitoring, verification, and accounting techniques (both well-established and promising new developments) appropriate for various project stages are discussed.

To explore the trade-offs between discounting, leakage, the cost of sequestration and the energy penalty (the energy necessary to capture, transport and inject carbon underground), we derive analytic expressions for the value of leaky CO2 storage compared to perfect storage when storage is a marginal component of the energy system. If the annual leak rate is 1% and the discount rate is 4%, for example, then CO2 mitigation using leaky storage is worth 80% of mitigation with perfect storage. Using an integrated assessment numerical model (DIAM) to explore the role of leakage when CO2 storage is non-marginal, we find that a leakage rate of 0.1% is nearly the same as perfect storage while a leakage rate of 0.5% renders storage unattractive. The possibility of capturing CO2 from the air, not only from flue gases, makes storage with higher leakage rates interesting.

Pre-emission capture and storage of CO2 in subsurface saline formations is one potential method to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the negative impact of global climate change. Like many large-scale resource assessments, the area under investigation is split into smaller, more manageable storage assessment units (SAUs), which must be aggregated with correctly propagated uncertainty to the basin, regional, and national scales. The aggregation methodology requires two types of data: marginal probability distributions of storage resource for each SAU, and a correlation matrix obtained by expert elicitation describing interdependencies between pairs of SAUs. Dependencies arise because geologic analogs, assessment methods, and assessors often overlap. The correlation matrix is used to induce rank correlation, using a Cholesky decomposition, among the empirical marginal distributions representing individually assessed SAUs. This manuscript presents a probabilistic aggregation method tailored to the correlations and dependencies inherent to a CO2 storage assessment. Aggregation results must be presented at the basin, regional, and national scales. A single stage approach, in which one large correlation matrix is defined and subsets are used for different scales, is compared to a multiple stage approach, in which new correlation matrices are created to aggregate intermediate results. Although the single-stage approach requires determination of significantly more correlation coefficients, it captures geologic dependencies among similar units in different basins and it is less sensitive to fluctuations in low correlation coefficients than the multiple stage approach.

In this paper we discuss the definition of an appropriate functional unit and the establishment of effective system boundaries in terms of activity, time and space, with an emphasis on the comparison of buildings. The functional unit can be defined at the level of building component, complete building, or services provided by the built environment. Energy use or carbon emissions per unit of mass or volume of material is inadequate as a functional unit because equal masses or volumes of different materials do not fulfil the same function. Activity-based system boundaries include life cycle processes such as material production, product operation, and post-use material management. If the products compared are functionally equivalent, such that the impacts occurring during the operation phase are equal, we suggest that this phase may be dropped from the analysis allowing a focus on material flows. The use of wood co-products as biofuel can be analytically treated through system expansion, and compared to an alternative of providing the same energy service with fossil fuels. The assumed production of electricity used for material processing is another important energy-related issue, and we suggest that using marginal production data is more appropriate than average production. Temporal system boundaries include such aspects of the wood life cycle as the dynamics of forest growth including regeneration and saturation, the availability of residue biofuels at different times, and the duration of carbon storage in products. The establishment of spatial boundaries can be problematic, because using wood-based materials instead of non-wood materials requires more land area to capture solar energy and accumulate biomass.

These feedback processes will be affected by vegetation changes, and feedback strengths will largely rely on the spatial extent and timing of vegetation change. Satellite remote sensing is widely used to monitor vegetation dynamics, and vegetation indices (VIs) are frequently used to characterize spatial and temporal trends in vegetation productivity. In this study we combine field observations of larch forest cover across a 25 km2 upland landscape in northeastern Siberia with high-resolution satellite observations to determine how the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) are related to forest cover. Across 46 forest stands ranging from 0% to 90% larch canopy cover, we find either no change, or declines in NDVI and EVI derived from PlanetScope CubeSat and Landsat data with increasing forest cover. In conjunction with field observations of NDVI, these results indicate that understory vegetation likely exerts a strong influence on vegetation indices in these ecosystems. This suggests that positive decadal trends in NDVI in Siberian larch forests may correspond primarily to increases in understory productivity, or even to declines in forest cover. Consequently, positive NDVI trends may be associated with declines in terrestrial carbon storage and increases in albedo, rather than increases in carbon storage and decreases in albedo that are commonly assumed. Moreover, it is also likely that important ecological changes such as large changes in forest density or variable forest regrowth after fire are not captured by long-term NDVI trends.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "c95edca54ac449d04741444770018f4cbfdf3e92", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1587951244", "DOI": "10.1002/wene.128", "CorpusId": 109863320}, "title": "Trends toward 100% renewable electricity supply in Germany and Europe: a paradigm shift in energy policies", "abstract": "In industrialized countries such as Germany, electricity production contributes 30\u201340% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the country. Confronted with GHG emission reductions targets of 80\u201395% by 2050 and with some GHG emitting sectors confronted with great difficulties to reach such targets, such as agriculture, the power sector will need to reduce its GHG emissions virtually to zero. As nuclear energy involves very substantial accident risks and the unsolved problem of safe long\u2010term deposit of nuclear waste and as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) has rather limited safe storage potentials at least in Europe, the question arises, whether it will be possible to supply 100% of all necessary electricity from renewable energy sources? We show that a fast expanding volume of analyses underlines the feasibility and reliability of 100% renewable electricity supply systems. This fast mounting evidence appears to mark the beginning of a paradigm shift in energy politics, as highly regarded national and international advisory bodies such as the IPCC or the German Council of Environmental Advisors start to adopt this perspective. The example of the highly publicized study of the German Council of Environmental Advisors shows how a 100% renewable electricity system for Germany, Europe, and North Africa could look in 2050 and how the transition toward such a system could be achieved. This study, conducted with major input from the authors, is used to show the major aspects of a 100% renewable electricity supply system, such as the security of supply in every hour of the year, the compensation of intermittent sources such as wind and solar PV energy by other renewables and expanded storage, and the necessary extension of national and international grid infrastructures.

Within this framework the impacts of a technology policy is illustrated that requires over time an increasing fraction of fossil-fired power generation to incorporate carbon capture technologies. In particular, we examine the potential costs and the contribution that such a policy could offer in reducing energy-related carbon dioxide emissions and highlight some of the technologies that may play a role in doing so. The analysis is carried out with the global energysystems optimization MESSAGE model (Messner and Strubegger 1995) considering endogenous technology learning for fossil power plants and the corresponding carbon capture technologies, such that they experience cost reductions as a function of accumulated capacity installations. The report describes two baseline scenarios: (1) including learning for fossil power plants and (2) the other with no learning. In addition, the analysis examines three cases that are based on a technology policy that enforces an increasing share of fossil fuel power plants with carbon capture, distinguishing between future worlds assuming: (1) no learning for fossil systems, (2) learning just for the carbon capture component, and (3) full learning for the reference plants as well as for the carbon capture systems. \n \nThe analysis shows that the introduction of a policy for carbon capture and storage would lead to considerable reductions in carbon emissions in the electricity sector and major changes in the power generation mix. Technologies are chosen, that provide the most cost-effective combination between electricity generation and carbon capture, fostering the penetration of advanced fossil technologies.

Although most of the CCS research to date has been concerned with underground storage in liquefied form, mineral carbonation is the only method that disposes CO2 in a permanent and inherently safe manner. Here, we consider the gas\u2013solid conversion of both MgO and Mg(OH)2 with CO2 in the presence and absence of steam in an attempt to model and predict the optimum conditions for rapid and complete carbonation. Results from pressurised thermogravimetric analysers (PTGA) and a laboratory scale pressurised fluidised bed (PFB) are presented. The results show that the carbonation of Mg(OH)2 is much faster (\u223c50% in 4 min) in a PFB than the carbonation of comparatively fine MgO ( 10%) accelerates the carbonation considerably. However, in the case of Mg(OH)2, the addition of steam to the CO2 is less important as it is provided intrinsically, as a result of the dehydroxylation of Mg(OH)2 at elevated temperatures. Still, humidifying the gas stream can help control dehydroxylation, thereby sustaining carbonation, which typically levels out short of completion. A careful control of the carbonation conditions (temperature, pressure, fluidising velocity, gas composition) and particle properties should allow for close to complete carbonation (>90%) without compromising the carbonation kinetics. Because the PFB carbonation step considered here is part of a larger CCS process (Mg extraction from a natural and abundant mineral followed by production of MgCO3), the precipitation stage [Mg(OH)2 formation] may be tailored to obtain the necessary particle properties (surface area, porosity).", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "b5340b388b39d5b5f592322c920d2bdff090dfd0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1662394832", "CorpusId": 108854572}, "title": "Scope for future CO2 emission reductions from electricity generation through the deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies", "abstract": "Ongoing work on the potential for carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) from fossil fuel power stations in the UK suggests that this technology may be capable of supplying significant amounts of low-emission electricity within one or two decades.

Using PNNL\u2019s integrated assessment modeling system, MiniCAM, we find that improving conventional crop productivity has the potential to reduce land-use change emissions by hundreds of billions of tons of carbon over the 21 st century. The importance of the potential role of crop productivity specifically as a means of climate change mitigation has gone largely unrecognized. We further find that limiting the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere carries implications for land use that are unavoidable and independent of the production of bioenergy crops. Land is a scarce resource and the carbon associated with unmanaged ecosystems provides a carbon storage service that, if valued, becomes increasingly valuable with time. This in turn means that relative to a reference scenario, a larger stock of unmanaged ecosystems and managed forests is desirable, which in turn raises land rents, raises crop prices, decreases crop production and the land that is used to produce crops. We find that crop and forest product waste streams are a potentially important source of bioenergy with or without a carbon price. We find very little dedicated bioenergy crop production before 2035 and therefore no noticeable effect on crop prices until after the middle of the century (absence non-climate-related subsidies). Failure to take into account the value of terrestrial carbon storage services by unmanaged ecosystems and managed forests could have dramatic consequences for unmanaged ecosystems if CO2 concentrations are limited. When terrestrial carbon is valued and both waste-derived and purpose-grown bioenergy technologies are available, the cost of limiting the concentration of CO2 is reduced in some scenarios by half. When carbon is valued the dominant use of bioenergy is power generation with CO2 capture and storage (CCS), not transportation fuels. We find that net global carbon emissions eventually become negative when CO2 concentration limits are set below 550 ppm in 2095 and both bioenergy and CCS technologies are jointly employed.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "05b2ad8cae627cad5326c694d28ba02123e1b674", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2765145594", "DOI": "10.1016/J.CEJ.2017.10.080", "CorpusId": 102910742}, "title": "Activated carbon (type Maxsorb-III) and MIL-101(Cr) metal organic framework based composite adsorbent for higher CH4 storage and CO2 capture", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "cc8e3aea637df3db3a5652bf158deb04820dbb82", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2886282055", "DOI": "10.1016/J.APENERGY.2018.07.117", "CorpusId": 117470755}, "title": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) retrofit potential of coal-fired power plants in China: The technology lock-in and cost optimization perspective", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "bca3a1b1c6b60b415c2574aad054a3043fa87033", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2034570739", "DOI": "10.1115/IPC2010-31572", "CorpusId": 137615394}, "title": "GASDECOM: Carbon Dioxide and Other Components", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2 ) pipelines are more susceptible to long running fractures than hydrocarbon gas pipelines because of the decompression characteristics of CO2 . The key to understanding this issue is the phase diagram and the liquid-vapour phase boundary. GASDECOM \u2014 based on the BWRS equation of state \u2014 is a program widely used for calculating the decompression behaviour of mixtures of hydrocarbons. The calculated decompression wave velocity curve is then used in models such as the Battelle Two Curve Model to determine the toughness required to arrest a propagating ductile fracture. GASDECOM is capable of modelling mixtures of hydrocarbons (methane through to hexane), nitrogen and carbon dioxide. It therefore can (and has) been used to investigate the effect of methane and nitrogen on the decompression characteristics of CO2 . Pipelines can be expected to play a significant role in the transportation infrastructure required for the successful implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS). The composition of the carbon dioxide rich stream to be transported in a pipeline depends on the capture technology, e.g. post-combustion, pre-combustion and oxy-fuel. Post-combustion tends to result in an almost pure stream. The other capture technologies produce a less pure stream, containing potentially significant proportions of other components such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, argon and methane. One of the factors that will constrain the design and operation of a carbon dioxide pipeline is the effect of these other components on the decompression characteristics, and hence the arrest toughness (amongst other issues). Components such as hydrogen, oxygen and argon cannot currently be considered using GASDECOM. Through a study of the underlying algorithms implemented in GASDECOM, it is shown how GASDECOM can be modified to include these additional components relevant to carbon capture and storage. The effect of impurities such as hydrogen on the decompression characteristics is then illustrated, and related back to their effect on the phase diagram and the liquid-vapour phase boundary. The sensitivity of the results to the use of equations of state other than BWRS is also illustrated. Simplifications that follow from the decompression behaviour of carbon dioxide are also highlighted. Finally, the small and large scale experimental studies that are required to validate predictions of the decompression behaviour and the arrest toughness are discussed.Copyright \u00a9 2010 by ASME", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "5d8c75de0cae80918b92a867b52b84732bff8aa3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3021141165", "DOI": "10.1002/adfm.202001592", "CorpusId": 218925058}, "title": "3D Carbon Nanotube Network Bridged Hetero\u2010Structured Ni\u2010Fe\u2010S Nanocubes toward High\u2010Performance Lithium, Sodium, and Potassium Storage", "abstract": "Lithium\u2010ion, sodium\u2010ion, and potassium\u2010ion batteries have captured tremendous attention in power supplies for various electric vehicles and portable electronic devices.

The CO2headers can satisfy the CO2demands for various industries located along the headers, which require CO2as its raw material. The CO2can be further regenerated, and mixed as needed with pure CO2generated from one or multiple centralised CO2plant if required. The excess CO2is to be sent to geological storage. The proper utilisation of CO2will reduce the amount of CO2needed to be stored. This will extend the geological carbon storage-life capacity.

Atmospheric CO2 levels will reach about 800 ppm by 2100 resulting in about 4 C rise in the earth surface temperature if no action is taken (CO2 Earth 2017). At the 21st Conference of Parties (COP21) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) held in Paris, France from 30th November to 12th December 2015, 195 nations historically agreed to \u2018\u2018combat climate change and unleash actions and investment towards a low carbon, resilient and sustainable future\u2019\u2019 with the aim to ensure global temperature rise is kept well below 2 C (UNFCCC 2015). To achieve this aim, a portfolio of technologies have been proposed, one of which is carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) (Dixon 2016). CCUS comprises of CCS and CCU, both of which involve capture of CO2 from various sources such as large stationary power plants (Cu\u00e9llar-Franca and Azapagic 2015). However, they differ in the destination of the captured CO2: (1) in CCS, CO2 is transported and injected into underground storage sites; (2) CO2 is converted to commercial products in CCU. The energy trilemma including energy security, energy affordability and environmental sustainability makes CCUS the most probable technology for reducing emissions from power plants and carbon intensive industries (IPCC 2014). Without CCUS, mitigation cost is predicted to be as high 138% as shown in Table 1. CCUS has attracted a great deal of research interest worldwide in recent years. Most research in the context of CCUS focuses on carbon capture since it offers the biggest challenges in terms of capital and operating cost contributing about 70%\u201380% of the total cost of the full CCUS network including capture, transport conversion/storage (Leung et al. 2014). CO2 capture is broadly classified into pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxy-fuel carbon capture approaches (Rubin et al. 2015). This is summed up in Fig. 1. In the different approaches, there are different processes for separating CO2 from gas mixtures such as chemical absorption, physical absorption, adsorption and membrane separation (Wang et al. 2011). Post-combustion based on chemical absorption is the most promising and also mature technologies because it uses very familiar technologies, retrofits more easily to existing power plants and there are already many demonstration projects across the world. The purpose of this special issue is to create a platform for scientists, engineers and practitioners to present their latest theoretical and technological advancements on carbon capture.

The hierarchical porous structure of the N-self-doped carbons could be easily tailored to obtain nanorod interconnected and fiber-wall interconnected architectures without using any porogen, catalyst or activator. The nanorod interconnected porous carbon displayed a high specific surface area of 1408 m2 g\u22121 while the fiber-wall interconnected porous carbon exhibited an excellent specific capacitance of 261 F g\u22121 (0.5 A g\u22121) due to the desirable hierarchical framework. In addition, these hierarchical porous carbons had a good CO2 capture performance (3.07\u20133.44 mmol g\u22121 at 25 \u00b0C). This unique method is supposed to be a new strategy to create novel 3D hierarchical porous carbons for promising applications in supercapacitors, lithium ion batteries, fuel cells and sorbents.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "a291959c5deea56abaa9445f395d48cc7a6608fb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2944986571", "DOI": "10.1002/GHG.1890", "CorpusId": 181553317}, "title": "A comprehensive review of sectorial contribution towards greenhouse gas emissions and progress in carbon capture and storage in Pakistan", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}]}
