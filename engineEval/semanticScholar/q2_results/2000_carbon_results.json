Most emission scenarios stabilizing climate at low levels, such as the 1.5 \u00b0C target as outlined by the Paris Agreement, require large-scale deployment of Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS). Here, the potential of large-scale BECCS deployment in contributing towards the 1.5 \u00b0C global warming target is evaluated using an Earth system model, as well as associated climate responses and carbon cycle feedbacks. The geographical location of the bioenergy feedstock is shown to be key to the success of such measures in the context of temperature targets. Although net negative emissions were reached sooner, by ~6 years, and scaled up, land use change emissions and reductions in forest carbon sinks outweigh these effects in one scenario. Re-cultivating mid-latitudes was found to be beneficial, on the other hand, contributing in the right direction towards the 1.5 \u00b0C target, only by \u22120.1 \u00b0C and \u221254 Gt C in avoided emissions, however.

We focus on countries that hold 80% of global fossil fuel reserves and compare them with key countries that have meagre fossil fuel reserves. We show that those countries with large domestic fossil fuel reserves have experienced a large increase in primary energy demand from fossil fuels, but only a moderate or no increase in primary energy from renewables, and in particular from non-hydro renewable energy sources (NHRES), which are assumed to represent the cornerstone of the future transformation of the global energy system. This implies a tremendous threat to climate change mitigation, with only two principal mitigation options for fossil-fuel-rich economies if there is to be compliance with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement: (1) leave the fossil fuels in the ground; and (2) apply carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Combinations of these two options to exploit their respective possibilities synergistically will require strong initiatives and incentives to transform a certain amount of the domestic fossil fuel reserves (including the associated infrastructure) into stranded assets and to create an extensive CCS infrastructure. Our conclusion is that immediate and disruptive changes to the use of fossil fuels and investments in non-carbon-emitting technologies are required if global warming is to be limited to well below 2\u00b0C. Collective actions along value chains in business to divert from fossil fuels may be a feasible strategy. Key policy insights The main obstacle to compliance with any reasonable warming target is the abundance of fossil fuels, which has maintained and increased momentum towards new fossil-fuelled processes. So far, there has been no increase in the share of NHRES in total global primary energy demand, with a clear decline in the NHRES share in India and China. There is an immediate need for the global community to develop fossil fuel strategies and policies. Policies must account for the global trade flow of products that typically occurs from the newly industrialized fossil fuel-rich countries to the developed countries.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "3176c6c40549d219b683f953d6ddb0f660943a1c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1518245814", "DBLP": "conf/amcc/SafdarnejadKBH15", "DOI": "10.1109/ACC.2015.7172120", "CorpusId": 13184728}, "title": "Investigating the impact of Cryogenic Carbon Capture on power plant performance", "abstract": "Cryogenic Carbon Capture (CCC) is a CO2 mitigation process that can be integrated into existing baseline and load following fossil-fueled power plants.

The capture of anthropogenic CO2 will mitigate against global warming and possibly reduce the impact of climate change. The United States has over 30 years of experience in transporting CO2, mainly from naturally-occurring CO2 sources, and mostly for the purpose of EOR. Both the source and the function of the CO2 pipelines in the USA have dictated a relatively-pure CO2 stream, in comparison, the UK's proposed carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects will be focusing on anthropogenic sources from major polluters such as fossil-fuel power plants, and the CO2 transport infrastructure will involve both on- and offshore pipelines. The fossil-fuel power plants will produce CO2 with varying combinations of impurities depending on the capture technology used. CO2 pipelines have never been designed for some of the impurities released from these power plants. Other key differences between the transport of CO2 in the US and the UK relate to design codes and legislation, pipeline routes, offshore transportation and also storage. The presence of impurities has a great impact on the physical properties of the transported CO2 that consequently affects pipeline design, compressor power, recompression distance, and pipeline capacity, and could also have implications for the prevention of fracture propagation. The effects could be either negative or positive: for example, the addition of some impurities tends to reduce compressor power while others increase the power required. These effects have direct implications for both the technical and economic feasibility of developing a CO2 transport infrastructure on- and offshore. This paper discusses the key differences between the CO2 transport scenarios in the US and the potential transport infrastructure in the UK and provides an understanding of these differences and the implications for designing a CO2-compliant pipeline.

We demonstrate that pore-scale capillary trapping is an effective and rapid mechanism to render the CO2 immobile in oil reservoirs. We construct analytical solutions to the transport equations, accounting for relative permeability hysteresis. We use this to design an injection strategy where CO2 and brine are injected simultaneously followed by chase brine injection. We study field-scale oil production and CO2 storage using a streamline-based simulator that captures dissolution, dispersion, gravity and ratelimited reactions in three dimensions. While injecting at the optimum WAG ratio gives the fastest oil recovery, this allows CO2 to channel through the reservoir leading to rapid CO2 breakthrough and extensive recycling of the gas. We propose to inject more water than optimum. This allows to CO2 to remain in the reservoir, increases the field life and leads to improved storage of CO2 as a trapped phase. A short period of chase brine injection at the end of the process traps most of the remaining CO2. Introduction Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), the collection of CO2 from industrial sources and its injection underground, could contribute significantly to reductions in atmospheric emissions of greenhouse gases (IPCC, 2005). Possible sites for injection include coalbeds, deep saline aquifers, and depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Although aquifers have the greatest storage potential, injecting CO2 into depleted oil and gas reservoirs can provide additional hydrocarbon production and improved storage security. The principal concern with CO2 storage is its long-term fate: can it be guaranteed that the CO2 will remain underground for hundreds to thousands of years? Since oil and gas has been trapped for geological time in hydrocarbon reservoirs, they should all contain impermeable seals preventing escape. However, the top seal could leak, have gaps or be penetrated by wells through which CO2 could migrate to the surface (Bruant et al., 2002). Dissolution in water and reaction with rock could also contribute to safe CO2 storage, but both are slow processes taking thousands to billions of years (Ennis-King and Paterson, 2005; Hesse et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2003). Capillary trapping (residual non-wetting phase trapping) has been recognized as the most rapid method to immobilize CO2 with time scales in the order of years to decades (Ennis-King and Paterson, 2002; Kumar et al., 2005; Obi and Blunt, 2006; Juanes et al., 2006; Taku Ide et al., 2007; Ghomian et al., 2008). Our previous study on the design of CO2 storage in aquifers (Qi et al., 2007) has recommended an injection strategy in which CO2 and brine are injected simultaneously followed by chase brine injection to render more than 85% of injected CO2 immobile in a very short period. In the oil industry, CO2 flooding has been used worldwide as a tertiary Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) mechanism for more than 30 years, particularly for reservoirs with pressures above the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) where miscible displacement would occur. The ideal reservoirs for miscible CO2 flooding usually have oil densities ranging from 29o to 48o API (882-788 kg/m 3 ) and reservoir depths from 760m to 3700m below the surface (Taber et al., 1997). CO2 flooding has the disadvantage that the unfavorable mobility ratio between the oil and CO2 can result in early CO2 breakthrough because of channeling of CO2 through the reservoir fluids. Water alternate gas (WAG) injection can be successfully applied to improve the sweep efficiency and delay early CO2 breakthrough (Lake, 1989). However, CO2 flooding EOR projects have been designed to minimize the amount of CO2 injected to recover the oil, since the CO2 costs money to transport and inject, while for CCS, injection needs to maximize both CO2 storage and oil recovery. It has been recommended by other researchers that the fluids be injected at the optimal WAG ratio, the injection gas composition be adjusted to reach the MMP, while the well type and completions are designed to maximize both oil recovery and CO2 storage (Jessen, et al., 2004; Kovscek and Cakici, 2004; Malik and Islam, 2000).", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "deea24086ef7faffe6e8f4dae7a81c955b3f9357", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2023622086", "DOI": "10.1080/17451000.2012.676189", "CorpusId": 84341169}, "title": "The effect of chronic and acute low pH on the intracellular DMSP production and epithelial cell morphology of red coralline algae", "abstract": "Abstract The release of dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP) by marine algae has major impacts on the global sulphur cycle and may influence local climate through the formation of dimethylsulphide (DMS).

This study examined the effect of low pH on DMS(P) production and epithelial cell morphology of the free-living red coralline alga Lithothamnion glaciale. Three pH treatments were used in the 80-day experiment: (1) current pH level (8.18, control), (2) low, chronic pH representing a 2100 ocean acidification (OA) scenario (7.70) and (3) low, acute pH (7.75, with a 3-day spike to 6.47), representing acute variable conditions that might be associated with leaks from carbon capture and storage infrastructure, at CO2 vent sites or in areas of upwelling. DMS(P) production was not significantly enhanced under low, stable pH conditions, indicating that red coralline algae may have some resilience to OA. However, intracellular and water column DMS(P) concentrations were significantly higher than the control when pH was acutely spiked. Cracks were observed between the cell walls of the algal skeleton in both low pH treatments.

In order to assess whether such shortages could jeopardise the objectives of the EU\u2019s Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan), an improved understanding of these risks is vital. In particular, this report examines the use of metals in the six low carbon energy technologies of SET Plan, namely: nuclear, solar, wind, bioenergy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and electricity grids. The study looks at the average annual demand for each metal for the deployment of the technologies in Europe between 2020 and 2030. The demand of each metal is compared to the respective global production volume in 2010. This ratio (expressed as a percentage) allows comparing the relative stress that the deployment of the six technologies in Europe is expected to create on the global supplies for these different metals. The study identifies 14 metals for which the deployment of the six technologies will require 1% or more (and in some cases, much more) of current world supply per annum between 2020 and 2030. These 14 metals, in order of decreasing demand, are tellurium, indium, tin, hafnium, silver, dysprosium, gallium, neodymium, cadmium, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, niobium and selenium. The metals are examined further in terms of the risks of meeting the anticipated demand by analysing in detail the likelihood of rapid future global demand growth, limitations to expanding supply in the short to medium term, and the concentration of supply and political risks associated with key suppliers. The report pinpoints 5 of the 14 metals to be at high risk, namely: the rare earth metals neodymium and dysprosium, and the by products (from the processing of other metals) indium, tellurium and gallium. The report explores a set of potential mitigation strategies, ranging from expanding European output, increasing recycling and reuse to reducing waste and finding substitutes for these metals in their main applications. A number of recommendations are provided which include: ensuring that materials used in significant quantities are included in the Raw Materials Yearbook proposed by the Raw Materials Initiative ad hocWorking Group, the publication of regular studies on supply and demand for critical metals, efforts to ensure reliable supply of ore concentrates at competitive prices, promoting R&D and demonstration projects on new lower cost separation processes, particularly those from by product or tailings containing rare earths, collaborating with other countries/regions with a shared agenda of risk reduction, raising awareness and engaging in an active dialogue with zinc, copper and aluminium refiners over by product recovery, creating incentives to encourage by product recovery in zinc, copper and aluminium refining in Europe, promoting the further development of recycling technologies and increasing end of life collection, measures for the implementation of the revised WEEE Directive, and investing broadly in alternative technologies. It is also recommended that a similar study should be carried out to identify the metal requirements and associated bottlenecks in other green technologies, such as electric vehicles, low carbon lighting, electricity storage and fuel cells and hydrogen.

Utilizing EGR increases the CO2 content in the gas turbine exhaust while it reduces the flue gas flow to be treated in the capture plant. Nevertheless, due to EGR, the gas turbine will experience a different: media with different properties compared to the design case. This study looks into how the turbo machinery reacts to EGR.

Most studies have not yet assessed the influence on these trajectories of emerging bioeconomy sectors such as biochemicals and renewable jet fuels (RJFs). To support a systems transition, there is also need to demonstrate the impact on the energy system of technology development, biomass and fossil fuel prices. We aim to close this gap by assessing least\u2010cost pathways to 2030 for a number of scenarios applied to the energy system of the Netherlands, using a cost\u2010minimization model. The type and magnitude of biomass deployment are highly influenced by technology development, fossil fuel prices and ambitions to mitigate climate change. Across all scenarios, biomass consumption ranges between 180 and 760 PJ and national emissions between 82 and 178 Mt CO2. High technology development leads to additional 100\u2013270 PJ of biomass consumption and 8\u201320 Mt CO2 emission reduction compared to low technology development counterparts. In high technology development scenarios, additional emission reduction is primarily achieved by bioenergy and carbon capture and storage. Traditional sectors, namely industrial biomass heat and biofuels, supply 61\u201387% of bioenergy, while wind turbines are the main supplier of renewable electricity. Low technology pathways show lower biochemical output by 50\u201375%, do not supply RJFs and do not utilize additional biomass compared to high technology development. In most scenarios the emission reduction targets for the Netherlands are not met, as additional reduction of 10\u201345 Mt CO2 is needed. Stronger climate policy is required, especially in view of fluctuating fossil fuel prices, which are shown to be a key determinant of bioeconomy development.

In the UK we have a formal target for the reduction of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions of 80 per cent by 2050 (on 1990 levels). Official publications regularly suggest that reducing overall energy demand is an important part of meeting that target. Indeed, in a recent report of the UK Committee on Climate Change (CCC, 2009, p. 22), it was suggested that residential energy efficiency measures could reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 50 million tonnes per annum (or around 10 per cent of the UK's current total emissions) by 2022. The UK is not alone: many other countries have targets and aspirations for the reduction of energy consumption. Meanwhile, the future of energy demand will increasingly be synonymous with the future of electricity demand if the heat and transport sectors are electrified over the coming decades. Decarbonization of the energy sector is not just about reducing energy demand. Emissions from direct combustion of heat and direct combustion of liquid fuel in vehicles are roughly equal to emissions from power stations. Reducing emissions from electricity production is technically feasible via a combination of renewables, nuclear power and carbon-capture-and-storage equipment. This implies that switching heating and transportation demand for energy from combustion of fossil fuels to heat from electricity (or combined heat and power) and to electric vehicles is important in reducing emissions.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "8e9708ef745f3ce1eb0955c88e4cc0f366f92eef", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2900537167", "DOI": "10.1002/CJCE.23393", "CorpusId": 105850437}, "title": "Current situation of carbon dioxide capture, storage, and enhanced oil recovery in the oil and gas industry", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "7e7afd8accab43e7e62d3f0816bd447068ab1366", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2525730207", "DOI": "10.1007/s00338-016-1506-0", "CorpusId": 22821836}, "title": "Spatial and temporal variation in reef-scale carbonate storage of large benthic foraminifera: a case study on One Tree Reef", "abstract": "Large benthic foraminifera (LBFs) are a vital component of coral reef carbonate production, often overlooked due to their small size. These super-abundant calcifiers are crucial to reef calcification by generation of lagoon and beach sands. Reef-scale carbonate production by LBFs is not well understood, and seasonal fluctuations in this important process are largely unquantified. The biomass of five LBF species in their algal flat habitat was quantified in the austral winter (July 2013), spring (October 2013), and summer (February 2014) at One Tree Reef. WorldView-2 satellite images were used to characterize and create LBF habitat maps based on ground-referenced photographs of algal cover. Habitat maps and LBF biomass measurements were combined to estimate carbonate storage across the entire reef flat. Total carbonate storage of LBFs on the reef flat ranged from 270\u00a0tonnes (winter) to 380\u00a0tonnes (summer). Satellite images indicate that the habitat area used by LBFs ranged from 0.6 (winter) to 0.71\u00a0km2 (spring) of a total possible area of 0.96\u00a0km2. LBF biomass was highest in the winter when algal habitat area was lowest, but total carbonate storage was the highest in the summer, when algal habitat area was intermediate. Our data suggest that biomass measurements alone do not capture total abundance of LBF populations (carbonate storage), as the area of available habitat is variable. These results suggest LBF carbonate production studies that measure biomass in discrete locations and single time points fail to capture accurate reef-scale production by not incorporating estimates of the associated algal habitat. Reef-scale measurements in this study can be incorporated into carbonate production models to determine the role of LBFs in sedimentary landforms (lagoons, beaches, etc.).

The comparison of the options is done at the impact assessment (LCIA) level by using the Eco-indicator 99 as well as the CO2 equivalent (IPCC 2001) method with 100 year time horizon.

Temperature is the key factor in direct gas-solid carbonation and had a notable influence on both the carbonation conversion and the CO\u2082 sequestration rate. The optimal CO\u2082 sequestrating temperature of 395 \u00b0C was easily obtained for APCr using a continuous heating experiment. CO\u2082 content in the flue gas had a definite influence on the CO\u2082 sequestration rate of the kinetics-controlled process, but almost no influence on the final carbonation conversion. Typical concentrations of SO\u2082 in the flue gas could not only accelerate the carbonation reaction rate of the product layer diffusion-controlled process, but also could improve the final carbonation conversion. Maximum carbonation conversions of between 68.6% and 77.1% were achieved in a typical flue gas. Features of rapid CO\u2082 sequestration rate, strong impurities resistance, and high capture conversion for direct gas-solid carbonation were proved in this study, which presents a theoretical foundation for the applied use of this encouraging technology on carbon capture and storage.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "82a54d080c92390b622e25ca95e273ba847dcd41", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2605254406", "DOI": "10.1098/rsbl.2016.0715", "CorpusId": 4476557, "PubMed": "28381631"}, "title": "Climate change mitigation: potential benefits and pitfalls of enhanced rock weathering in tropical agriculture", "abstract": "Restricting future global temperature increase to 2\u00b0C or less requires the adoption of negative emissions technologies for carbon capture and storage.

The GIS system contains information (e.g., fuel type, location, vintage, ownership, rated capacity) on all fossil-fired generation capacity in the Untied States with a rated capacity of at least 100 MW. There are also data on other CO2 sources (i.e., natural domes, gas processing plants, etc.) and associated pipelines currently serving enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects. Data on current and prospective CO2 EOR projects include location, operator, reservoir and oil characteristics, production, and CO2 source. The system also contains information on priority deep saline aquifers and coal bed methane basins with potential for sequestering CO2. The GIS application not only enables data storage, flexible map making, and visualization capabilities, but also facilitates the spatial analyses required to solve complex linking of CO2 sources with appropriate and cost-effective sinks.

Aquistore is a carbon storage research and monitoring project in Southern Saskatchewan, Canada, which intends to demonstrate that storing carbon dioxide (CO2) in the deep underground is a safe, workable solution to reduce greenhouse gases. Aquistore receives carbon dioxide transported by pipeline from the nearby Boundary Dam coal-fired power plant and injects it into the deepest saline formation of the Williston Basin at a 3200-m depth. The Aquistore site is located in a region reclaimed after open-pit coal mining that was continued until the 1990s. To characterize ground conditions and anthropogenic features of the Aquistore area, we used a RapidEye Constellation optical image.

However, diffusion coefficients are amongst the least studied of thermophysical properties, especially at high pressure, high temperature conditions. This work extended previous measurements where available, and produced new measurements where not, of diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution of CO2 in H2O, and several relevant brines and hydrocarbons at high temperatures (< 423 K) and high pressures (< 69 MPa). The Taylor dispersion method was used to determine diffusion coefficients for CO2 in water and selected hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons chosen as representative of major crude oil components were n-heptane, nhexadecane, squalane, cyclohexane, and toluene. A technique based on nuclear magnetic resonance was used to measure effective diffusion coefficients of CO2 in several brines, encompassing monovalent and divalent salts, and a mixed brine. The diffusion coefficients of CO2 in water were correlated using the Stokes-Einstein equation in which the Stokes-Einstein number was assigned a value of 4 and the hydrodynamic radius was treated as a linear function of temperature. No relationship between brine salinity and the hydrodynamic radius was found. The results indicated pressure did not have an observable impact on the diffusivity in aqueous systems. The experimental uncertainty was found to be 2.3% with a coverage factor of 2 for the CO2-water system and 1.5% with a coverage factor of 2 for the CO2-brine systems. In contrast to aqueous systems, the diffusion coefficient of CO2 in hydrocarbons was found to be strongly dependent on pressure. At a given temperature the diffusion coefficient decreased by up to 50% over the pressure range investigated (1 to 69 MPa).

In order to mitigate the rise in C[H.sub.2] concentration and ideally to reduce it, various methods for carbon capture and storage (2) (CCS) have been proposed, also known as \"carbon capture and sequestration\". To \"remove\" this amount of C[H.sub.2] entirely would require phenomenal levels of engineering since around 87 million tonnes per day of C[H.sub.2] would need to be captured. There are essentially two methods to remove carbon from fuel: post-combustion and precombustion. In post-combustion treatment, the flue-gas of a power station is passed through a liquid amine (e.g. ethanolamine and its derivatives) which dissolves the C[O.sub.2] from it. In the pre-combustion approach, the fuel (coal, gas, biomass) is processed into a mixture of C[O.sub.2] + [H.sub.2] and the C[O.sub.2] is removed: initially, a mixture of CO + [H.sub.2]O is produced [Eqn (1)] but the CO is converted to C[O.sub.2] by reaction with [H.sub.2]O, squeezing-out another molecule of [H.sub.2] in the process [water-gas shift reaction; Eqn (2)]. Following either method, the C[O.sub.2] must be stored somewhere (Figure 1), for which strategies include pumping it into rocky formations (such as depleted oil and gas wells) at a pressure of 100 atmospheres, or even piping it in liquid form under pressure onto the sea-floor where it is cold enough and the pressure high enough that it is hoped the material will stay there, assisted by the formation of C[O.sub.2]-hydrate. These and other aspects of CCS are now elaborated upon. [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] Capture While the extraction of C[O.sub.2] from the air is technically possible, the gas is most readily captured at point sources (2) e.g. large fossil fuel or biomass power plants, industries with major C[O.sub.2] emissions such as cement factories, natural gas processing plants, and hydrogen production plants which generate syngas by steam-reforming [Eqn (1)] and convert the CO to C[O.sub.2] using the water-gas shift reaction [Eqn (2)]: C[H.sub.4] + 2[H.sub.2]0 [right arrow] CO + 3[H.sub.2] (1) CO + [H.sub.2]O [right arrow] C[O.sub.2] + [H.sub.2] (2) As the distance from the point source increases, the concentration of C[O.sub.2] falls rapidly which necessitates an increase in the amount of air that must be processed per unit mass of C[O.sub.2] captured. The combustion of coal in oxygen produces a relatively pure, concentrated stream of C[O.sub.2], which might be processed directly. Organisms that produce ethanol by fermentation generate cool, and practically pure, C[O.sub.2] which is suitable for underground storage. World ethanol production in 2008 was close to 16 billion US gallons, which at a density of 789.00 kg [m.sup.-3] amounts to 61,000,000 [m.sup.3] or 48 million tonnes of the material (3). There are essentially three principal methods for capturing C[O.sub.2]: post-combustion, pre-combustion, and oxyfuel combustion: * In post-combustion capture, the C[O.sub.2] is removed following combustion of the fossil fuel, i.e. the scheme that would be used to reduce carbon emissions from fossil-fuel fired power plants. The technology is well understood and is used in other industrial applications, although some considerable scale-up would be required to deal with the C[O.sub.2] output from a standard (e.g. I GW) power station, which might burn 3.5 million tonnes of coal per year. * Pre-combustion carbon capture might be accomplished using the kind of technology that is used to make (ammonia for) fertiliser, and fuels ([H.sub.2], C[H.sub.4]),and for power production (4).The reactions described in Eqns (1) and (2) prevail, and the final C[O.sub.2] can be extracted from a relatively pure exhaust stream, leaving [H. \u2026", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "13e97ec27d774712ca60748aa16a603cd795f25d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2056338921", "DOI": "10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2015.02.016", "CorpusId": 154440778}, "title": "Opportunities and obstacles for CO2 mineralization: CO2 mineralization specific frames in the interviews of Finnish carbon capture and storage (CCS) experts", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "92f29b3f7594970484370a28a3af9540f17aa9a0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2334981930", "DOI": "10.7763/IJCEA.2012.V3.229", "CorpusId": 73683618}, "title": "Green Cement Production: Potentials and Achievements", "abstract": "Abstract \u2014 In this work, three strategies of CO2 reduction including energy saving, carbon separation, and storage as well as utilizing alternative materials in detail have been reviewed.

Those modelling studies that incorporate varying degrees of geological realism show the inherent risks and uncertainties that can result from neglecting heterogeneity and reservoir\u2013caprock topography along the migration path of an injected CO2 plume. A key problem is that detailed geological data are often not available for the relatively deep saline aquifers that are an important target for CCS. Deep saline aquifers fall between the relatively data-rich environments of shallow freshwater aquifers and hydrocarbon reservoirs and it is in these settings that outcrop analogues may play an important part in reducing the risks and uncertainties associated with CCS. This study uses an example from the Sherwood Sandstone Group (Otter Sandstone Formation) of the Wessex Basin to show how an outcrop study can impart a much greater understanding of heterogeneity in critical reservoir\u2013caprock zones. Here the transition from the Sherwood Sandstone Group (fluvial sandstone reservoir) to the Mercia Mudstone Group (playa lacustrine mudstone seal) is not simple, but includes a major change in fluvial style that introduces considerable heterogeneity at the top of the reservoir.

It suggests various modes of flexible operation that could be possible for fossil-fired plant with carbon capture and presents an initial model to quantify the performance of capture plants. Suitable methods for further analysis are discussed. It is also important to realise that some renewable technologies are not intermittent and a portfolio of technologies must be developed.

Since millions of years are required to form fossil fuels in the earth, their reserves are finite and subject to depletion as they are consumed. The only natural, renewable carbon resource known that is large enough to be used as a substitute for fossil fuels is biomass. This article gives an overview of the state-of-the-art of key biomass conversion technologies currently deployed and technologies that may play a key role in the future, including possible linkage to CO2 capture and sequestration technology (CCS). In doing so, special attention is paid to production of biofuels for the transport sector, because this is likely to become the key emerging market for large-scale sustainable biomass use. A range from 200 to 300 EJ may be observed looking well into this century, making biomass a more important energy supply option than mineral oil today. A key issue for bio-energy is that its use should be modernized to fit into a sustainable development path. Especially promising are the production of electricity via advanced conversion concepts (i.e. gasification and state-of-the-art combustion and co-firing) and modern biomass derived fuels like methanol, hydrogen and ethanol from ligno-cellulosic biomass, which can reach competitive cost levels within 1\u20132 decades (partly depending on price developments with petroleum). The gasification route offers special possibilities to combine this with low cost CO2 capture (and storage), resulting in concepts that are both flexible with respect to primary fuel input as well as product mix and with the possibility of achieving zero or even negative carbon emissions. Further biomass market development, consistent policy support, RD&D efforts and international collaboration are essential to achieve this.", "year": 2014}]}
