Its geologic setting offers an opportunity to assess both the traditional reservoir targets, e.g., fluvial sandstones, and less traditional options for CO2 storage, e.g., mafic intrusions and lavas. Select samples from the basal, predominantly fluvial, Stockton Formation are characterized by relatively high porosity (8%\u201318%) and air permeability (0.1\u201350 mD), but borehole hydraulic tests suggest negligible transmissivity even in the high-porosity intervals, emphasizing the importance of scale in evaluating reservoir properties of heterogeneous formations. A stratigraphic hole drilled by TriCarb Consortium for Carbon Sequestration in the northern basin also intersected numerous sandstone layers in the predominantly lacustrine Passaic Formation, characterized by core porosity and permeability up to 18% and 2000 mD. However, those layers are shallow (predominantly above 1 km in this part of the basin) and lack prominent caprock layers above. The mudstones in all three of the major sedimentary formations (Stockton, Lockatong, and Passaic) are characterized by a high CO2 sealing capacity \u2014 evaluated critical CO2 column heights exceed several kilometers. The igneous options are represented by basalt lavas, with porous flow tops and massive flow interiors, and a crystalline but often densely fractured Palisade Sill. The Newark Basin basalts may be too shallow for sequestration over most of the basin\u2019s area, but many other basalt flows exist in similar rift basins. Abundant fractures in sedimentary and igneous rocks are predominantly closed and/or sealed by mineralization, but stress indicators suggest high horizontal compressional stresses and strong potential for reactivation. Overall, the basin potential for CO2 storage appears low, but select formation properties are promising and could be investigated in the Newark Basin or other Mesozoic rift basins with similar fill but a different structural architecture. Introduction As anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) continue to grow, the need to mitigate their negative effects on Earth\u2019s climate becomes more and more pressing. Most energy technology evaluations agree that carbon capture, utilization, and storage should be part of a global solution for CO2 emission reduction (e.g., IEA, 2018; IPCC, 2018). A diverse portfolio of potential sites for geologic CO2 storage is needed to achieve the necessary storage volumes and efficiency and to reduce operational costs (e.g., Aydin et al., 2010; Levine et al., 2016; Rodosta et al., 2017). Here, we report the results of evaluating reservoir and N. V. Zakharova1,2, D. S. Goldberg2, P. E. Olsen2, D. Collins3, and D. V. Kent2,4 sealing properties of the Mesozoic Newark rift basin, located in the northeastern United States. The site lies in close proximity to many CO2 sources, such as large industrial plants, oil refineries, and fossil-fuel-based electric generating facilities in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (Figure 1). The Newark Basin is one of the largest exposed rift basins along the U.S. Atlantic coast, which were formed during the breakup of Pangaea in Late Triassic-Early Jurassic (Olsen et al., 1989; Withjack et al., 2013). The basin fill consists of fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary rocks and intrusive and extrusive basaltic rocks belonging to the Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP) (Figure 1). This geologic setting offers an opportunity to evaluate both the conventional sedimentary features, such as basal fluvial sandstones, and more exploratory options for CO2 storage, such as basic igneous rocks. The latter are highly reactive with CO2 and could help to permanently sequester anthropogenic CO2 through carbonation (e.g., McGrail et al., 2016; Pogge von Strandmann et al., 2019). Material presented in this paper draws on multiple projects conducted in the Newark Basin over more than 20 years of research and aims at synthesizing results relevant to evaluating the CO2 storage potential of the Newark Basin formations. One of the earliest and most significant scientific drilling campaigns was the Newark Basin Coring Project (NBCP) in the 1990s, which collected more than 6700 m of core spanning the full stratigraphic section of the basin along with standard well logging data (Goldberg et al., 1994; Kent et al., 1995; Olsen et al., 1996). Many subsequent studies utilized this core collection, drilled from seven stratigraphically offset holes in the central part of the basin (Figure 1c). More recently, the TriCarb Consortium for Carbon Sequestration (TriCarb) collected new seismic data and drilled a deep stratigraphic hole in the northern part of the basin, with some limited coring and extensive state-of-the-art well logging, specifically for evaluating Newark Basin\u2019s CO2 storage potential (Collins, 2017) (Figure 3). A shorter core hole was also drilled in the northern part of the basin penetrating the main igneous body, the Palisade Sill, the basal sandstones, and reaching basement. The TriCarb study was followed by a narrower geomechanical study of the Newark Basin formations, and petrophysical results from this project are also incorporated in the paper. Finally, core analysis is complemented by the results of hydrogeologic tests performed in two shallow test wells on the campus of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University (Goldberg and Burgdorff, 2005; Matter et al., 2006; Zakharova et al., 2016). 1Central Michigan University, Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA.

This information makes it possible to draw some preliminary conclusions on the suitability of the Newark Basin for geologic CO2 storage and highlights issues that need to be addressed in the studies of Mesozoic rift basins for carbon sequestration (Table 1). Basin structure and potential CO2 storage targets The Newark Basin is an elongated half-graben rift basin encompassing an area of more than 7510 km2 in southeastern New York, northern New Jersey, and southeastern Pennsylvania (Figure 1). The strata generally are dipping northwest toward the border fault system at about 10\u00b0 from horizontal and are overlapping crystalline basement on the eastern side. Several intrabasinal faults exist, predominantly northeast-striking normal faults synthetic to the border fault system (e.g., Schlische, 1992). The Late Triassic basin sediments are subdivided based on lithostratigraphy into the predominantly fluvial Stockton Formation, predominantly deep-lake lacustrine Lockatong Formation, and predominantly red-bed lacustrine Passaic Formation (Figure 2) (Olsen et al., 1996). The three major formations are overlain by a series of thinner basalt flows interbedded with fluvio-lacustrine sedimentary formations of latest Triassic-Early Jurassic age, which are preserved in a relatively small northwestern area of the basin adjacent to the border fault (Figure 1c). The intrusive Palisade Sill occurs at different depths and stratigraphic levels at different locations. As the most recent seismic data by TriCarb illustrate (Figure 1d), the sill, at least in the northern part of the basin, forms a continuous body across the basin and is often discordant to bedding. The coarse-grained Stockton Formation, which makes up the basal formation in the Newark Basin, has been identified as the primary target for CO2 storage (Collins, 2017). It consists of mostly buff and red conglomerate; buff, white, and gray arkose; and red Table 1. Summary of reservoir and sealing properties of major Newark Basin formations.

We develop, using a combined bottom-up analysis and top-down learning curve approach, a levelized cost of carbon abatement (LCCA) model for assessing the true cost of emissions mitigation in CCUS technology under carbon pricing mechanisms.

It is generated by heating mined calcium carbon limestone to form calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. These two products are injected into the thick juice (from the sugar beet processing) and reforms calcium carbonate. When the calcium carbonate reforms it captures or adsorbs many of the impurities in the juice and precipitates from the juice. The precipitate forms a solid lime product that needs to be discarded leaving behind the thin juice from which sugar is extracted. The seven sugar beet processing factories in North Dakota and Minnesota produce approximately 500,000 tons (dry weight basis) of spent lime annually. Historically, spent lime has simply been stock piled on site at each of the factories. As a result, large mounds of this material are present at each factory site and the mounds continue to grow each year. Storage of spent lime in this manner may create problems in the future for the factories as current storage permits expire, stock piles grow larger and environmental and space limitation awareness increases. One, potential disposal possibility is to apply it to the land or production fields. Spent lime is sold as Lime X in Europe and farmers apply it to their fields. However, these fields tend to have low soil pH and liming is required as a general management practice. Generally, spent lime has about 86% of the acid neutralizing potential as an equivalent quantity of fresh lime. Most soil pH in eastern North Dakota and western and central Minnesota is naturally at alkaline levels. There are isolated areas were soil pH may be acidic and require lime application as part of the management practice. But, many of the soils in the sugar beet factory areas are already at pH levels of 7.5 or above and do not require lime. There is little need to use spent lime from the sugar industry to correct soil pH problems. In isolated areas near the Minn-Dak Sugar Cooperative, a few growers were concerned about carryover of herbicide that was applied the previous year. The soil in these areas tended to be slightly acidic, which can contribute to herbicide carryover issues. Spent lime from the local sugar processing factory was applied in an attempt to raise soil pH and accelerate the break down, thus reducing the carryover, of the herbicide. Research was also initiated at NDSU to study this potential effect of spent lime. Interestingly, it was observed that Aphanomyces root rot was lessened where spent lime was applied in these experiments. One grower applied spent lime to approximately five acres in 1997 in an attempt to reduce herbicide carry over. When sugar beet was grown in 2003, the entire field had a severe infestation of Aphanomyces root rot except the area that received spent lime 7 years previously. Aphanomyces root rot in sugar beet is becoming a larger problem in the sugar beet growing areas of North Dakota and Minnesota. There is no effective control of this disease except for developing variety resistance. The possibility of using a factory produced by-product that is becoming troublesome to deal with, but may have a positive impact on this disease, is exciting. Thus, experiments were initiated to examine this potential (See Windels et al., in this volume for details of the disease aspect of the experiment). Since spent lime is formed during sugar processing and its purpose is to remove impurities from the juice, it seems possible that it may contain numerous chemical components, some of which may be considered nutrients. Factory chemical analysis of spent lime verify that it contains many potential nutrients such as phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N), and other micro and macro nutrients in addition to organic compounds. Exactly what chemical form these potential nutrients exist as in the spent lime and if they can indeed be utilized as crop nutrients is not known. It also seems logical that the impurities removed from the juice when spent lime is formed may differ with juice made from sugar beet grown in different regions on different soils in different environments. Therefore, the impurities in the spent lime may also vary among the factories.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "eeca160be21a5e912a0473cd2c5c2b75a62cdd85", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2349974709", "CorpusId": 131081658}, "title": "Analysis on the Research Progress in Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage(CCS) is a technology that separates CO2 from the atmosphere by technical measures to capture,store and permanently seal CO2 in the end.The major task is to lower the carbon emission and retard the climate change.The thesis introduces the principles and concept of CCS,clarifies the technical measures for CCS and presents the current research progress.It also forecasts the future development of this technology,indicating that high costs will be a barri er for the wide application of CCS and capture before combustion may become a potential direction for CCS's further development.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "2bd790b4d14ef796040f745eb891649594929bb9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3185424103", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-030-77200-0_10", "CorpusId": 237690062}, "title": "Capillary Phase Trapping", "abstract": "After primary and secondary recovery, substantial amounts of hydrocarbon remain entrapped by capillary forces.

Understanding the amount of trapped phase is vital for different applications such as enhance oil recovery (EOR), enhanced gas recovery (EGR), and carbon capture and storage (CCS). In EOR and EGR, the purpose is reducing residual oil saturation, while for CCS, it is opposite, i.e. the target is maximising the amount of trapped CO2. There are two main capillary trapping mechanisms, snap-off and by-passing which are described in detail in this chapter. The laboratory methods and empirical mathematical models that are used to measure and predict the trapped phase saturation are discussed in this chapter.

Over 100 years, natural rocks have been a focus of studies on how fluids such as hydrocarbons, greenhouse gases, and water flow through their porous systems.

Most 3D printing techniques have resolution restraints during fabrication that makes feature reproduction at the 1:1 scale almost impossible. A new developing technology that uses two-photon lithography and ultraviolet (UV) light curable resin allows for nanometer features to be 3D printed. However, the main challenge of this 3D printing method is the small size of the resulting model (less than 20 mm in each direction). This technical note presents a detailed workflow on how to fabricate a carbonate rock replica at the micron scale. To test this workflow, a pore network was obtained from tomographic data of a reservoir rock core located in Mexico (1 mm in diameter and 2 mm in height) and was 3D printed at the original size. This replica was subjected to tomographic and scanning electron imaging to verify the accuracy of pore geometry.

This research focuses on strategies to reduce CO2 emissions from energy systems in the context of the process industries. In the process industries, energy systems consume fuel to generate steam and power for site process units. Improving energy efficiency can reduce costs of energy generation and use, as well as CO2 emissions. This research develops an integrated design and optimisation methodology for energy systems, allowing effective capture and control of carbon dioxide emissions. The first focus of this study is to develop a systematic approach to evaluate combinatorial strategies for reducing CO2 emissions, based on a techno-economic analysis. A conceptual design procedure with hierarchical decision-making is introduced to combine CO2 emissions reduction strategies, accounting for interactions between site components, including the heat exchanger network and utility system. CO2 emissions reduction options considered in development of this procedure include process integration techniques for improving the energy efficiency of the site and fuel switching. The proposed approach considers trade-offs between the economy of energy retrofit and CO2 emissions penalties. Opportunity for reducing the CO2 penalty is included in the economic evaluation of the combined emissions reduction strategies. A mathematical model for simultaneous optimization of emissions reduction strategies is developed. In addition to emissions reduction strategies, options for trading CO2 allowances are considered in the model. The proposed mathematical method applies Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming (MINLP) optimization, which employs a superstructure of the strategies for CO2 reduction. The proposed mathematical model relates the selected options to their operating and capital costs and to their associated CO2 emissions, allowing the optimizer to search for the optimal combination of emissions reduction strategies. While the reduction in CO2 emissions through process integration techniques is based on the existing configuration of a site and the associated structural limitations, integration of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies can provide greater mitigation of CO2 emissions from a site. However, important challenges of implementing CCS in the process industries are the energetic and economic impact of the CCS plant on the integrated site. In the second part of this study, these energy-economic issues are explored. The CCS technologies addressed in this thesis include post- and pre-combustion CO2 capture techniques. Simulation of each capture technique is carried out in process simulation software to characterize the energy performance of the CO2 capture plant. Sensitivity analyses are carried out for key parameters of the CO2 capture plant. The relationship between these key parameters and the energy balance of the capture plant is represented using a simple energy performance model for the CO2 capture plant. This model allows the integration of the CO2 capture plant with the site utility system to be explored. Interactions between the utility system and CO2 capture plant are considered. The site utility system, together with the CO2 capture plant, is optimized for minimum operating cost. The proposed procedures are illustrated by application to a case study of a medium-scale oil refinery. The results illustrate that to reduce CO2 emissions, heat integration, utility system optimization and fuel switching provide more cost-effective solutions than integrating CCS technologies. The mathematical model allows more cost-effective solutions to be identified than using sequential, conceptual methods, but the value of the conceptual method for developing insights is also illustrated. The results demonstrate that, depending on the potential of the site for increasing heat recovery and the type of fuel used on site, solutions that combine energy efficiency and fuel switching can provide up to 40% reduction in site CO2 emissions. Integrating a post-combustion CO2 capture plant with the site utility system can provide up to 90 mol% pure CO2 for sequestration; however, the high capital cost of the capture plant reduces the economic performance of the integrated site. The high heat demand of post-combustion CO2 capture for solvent regeneration increases the fuel consumption of the site and its utility system, which in turn reduces the recovery of CO2. The results reveal that pre-combustion CO2 capture can provide opportunities for heat and power generation to improve the techno-economic performance of the overall integrated site.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "e37ac257abc8fea331a58803cca95abee800e2f7", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 54898176}, "title": "rgument map for carbon capture and storage ander", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can contribute to the deep CO2 cuts which are necessary to achieve climate change targets.

This is the type of rock that could be used for CO 2 storage-the CO 2 becomes trapped in the pore spaces (highlighted in blue) between the grains of rock. CONTENTS 1 Carbon dioxide (CO 2) is the main cause of global warming and the level of CO 2 in the earth's atmosphere is rising as a result of human activities.

Carbon sequestration stands as a strategic principle for mitigating the adverse effect of changing climate as it removes CO2 from atmosphere and stores in soil, plant or in water bodies. In simpler terms, it is a process of capturing CO2 and storing them in forest, ocean or in deep geological formations for long term and thereby reducing the concentration of CO\u2082 in the atmosphere. Soil can be considered as the largest carbon reservoir of the terrestrial carbon cycle for storing large amount of soil organic carbon. Agronomic practices such as reduced tillage, manuring, residue incorporation, crop rotation and mulching play important roles in sequestering soil carbon. Growing crops in rotation provides advantage of storing more Carbon in soil as compared to mono cropping. Minimum tillage practices as well as incorporation of residues increases the soil carbon content significantly. Adding organic manures and fertilisers to soil, Growing forest trees, revegetation of degraded land and following various land use options also adds to the soil carbon storage. Applying soil amendments not only improves soil characteristics but also checks CO\u2082 and methane emissions. Many of the practices that facilitate carbon sequestration are also found to improve soil aggregate formation, water holding capacity, fertility status of soil and food security.

Such systems, termed CO2 Plume Geothermal (CPG), have the potential to permit expansion of geothermal energy use while supporting rapid implementation. While most previous analyses have focused on heat transfer in the reservoir and surface components of CO2-based geothermal operations, here we examine wellbore heat transfer. In particular, we explore the hypothesis that wellbore flow can be assumed to be adiabatic for the majority of a CPG facility's lifespan. Introduction Part of the effort to limit CO2 emissions to the atmosphere requires that existing and emerging energy systems shift away from using fossil fuels as primary energy inputs and towards renewable sources that may be used to generate electricity. Renewable sources of primary energy, including geothermal heat, offer the potential to produce electricity with little or no operational CO2 emissions. The transition towards these renewable energy sources will be slow, in part because of embedded infrastructure that naturally turns over on the order of half a century, and in part because the high energy density of hydrocarbons and well-developed hydrocarbon power systems result in produced electricity that is inexpensive relative to other options. Given that CO2 emissions are increasing and unlikely to be abated by sudden and dramatic changes in how societies produce, convert, and use energy, applications that can use CO2 -particularly to produce electricity -may enable transitions to renewables that are not disruptive to economies and the climate. Numerous previous studies have discussed using supercritical CO2 as the subsurface working fluid for geothermal energy capture (e.g., [Brown, 2000], [Pruess, 2006; 2008], [Atrens et al., 2009], [Randolph and Saar, 2010; 2011]). Numerical analyses suggest CO2 transfers heat more efficiently than water, particularly in naturally permeable and porous geologic formations, i.e., in Randolph, Adams, Kuehn, Saar 2 CO2-Plume Geothermal (CPG) systems [Randolph and Saar, 2010; 2011], as a result of its relatively high mobility (inverse kinematic viscosity) and compressibility in deep geologic formations, the latter contributing to a strong thermosyphon [Atrens et al., 2009, Adams et al., in preparation]. Therefore, CO2-based geothermal operations may permit use of lower temperature and lower permeability geologic formations than those currently deemed economically viable. CPG systems involve injecting CO2 -produced by hydrocarbon power systems and/or other industries -into deep, naturally porous and permeable geologic formations where the CO2 displaces native reservoir fluid and is heated by the natural insitu heat and the background geothermal heat flux. A portion of the heated CO2 is piped to the surface, providing energy for electricity production or direct heat utilization, before being returned to the subsurface. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) using CO2 as the subsurface heat transfer medium are designed very similarly to water-based EGS but, like CPG, achieve many of the advantages of CO2 over water (e.g., [Pruess, 2006]). With either system, the injected CO2 is ultimately geologically stored, though CPG provides far larger CO2 storage capacities and higher energy electricity production efficiency [Randolph and Saar, 2011]. Previous CPG analyses [Randolph and Saar, 2010; 2011], as well as many CO2-based EGS studies (e.g., [Atrens et al., 2009], [Pruess, 2006; 2008]), have focused on subsurface heat transfer or surface components of the system while assuming minimal or no heat loss or gain in the production or injection wells, respectively, and no wellbore frictional losses. To ensure the accuracy of future CPG studies, wellbore flow and heat transfer assumptions -in particular, that of adiabatic expansion/compression -are examined in detail in the present investigation. In the wells, heat is transferred with surrounding rock, and frictional effects between the flowing fluid and the pipe wall result in pressure loss. Back-of-the envelope calculations reveal Reynolds numbers on the order of 10 for CO2 pipeflow, suggesting large advective heat transfer coefficients. However, this effect may be offset by the low effective thermal conductivity of the subsurface solid-fluid complex. Moreover, the low dynamic viscosity of supercritical CO2, together with the relative smoothness of the nickel-steel pipe generally required for CO2 wells, Figure 1: Several potential implementations of CO2-based geothermal systems (modified after Randolph and Saar [2011]). Randolph, Adams, Kuehn, Saar 3 suggest frictional losses are low. These opposing factors indicate further wellbore analysis is warranted and, thus, is presented below. Heat Transfer Model and Theory A simple, quasi-one-dimensional transient heat transfer model is generated, as shown in Figure 2, representing the buoyant ascent of heated CO2 from the reservoir to the surface. We assume that convective heat transfer outside of the wellbore is negligible. While future studies may allow consideration of convective flow, neglecting it is considered reasonable because reservoir formations chosen for CPG installations will, by necessity, be overlain by large extents of lowpermeability caprock -ensuring injected CO2 is trapped in the reservoir -with minimal potential for fluid flow and, hence, convective heat exchange. We further assume that temperature gradients in the vertical direction are much less than in the radial direction. Thus, vertical heat transfer is assumed negligible compared to radial transfer, permitting the model to be one-dimensional in the radial direction. The model contains 6 radial grid blocks with radii of 0.125m, 2m, 10m, 20m, 40m, and 100m; and 10 grid blocks in the axial direction at even increments of 250m. Finer radial and vertical grid refinements were tested but found to be unnecessary for the purpose of this investigation. We develop the model using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) for its simultaneous equation solving ability in a single axial slice and efficient retrieval of thermodynamic property data, where the latter is based on Span and Wagner [1996]. EES is linked iteratively with MATLAB on a macro-level to process and store axial and time increment results. Heat transfer and frictional losses should be more significant in CPG production wells, as opposed to injection wells, because of higher fluid temperature and flow velocity for relatively low density produced CO2. Thus, we focus here on production well behavior. The CO2 fluid conditions at the bottomhole well inlet are fixed at 25 MPa, 100\u00b0C, and 80 kg/s, consistent with the base case of previous investigations [Randolph and Saar, 2010; 2011]. Heat transfer is found for a buoyant CO2 rise of 2.5 km, while the surrounding rock temperature is set initially to a linear geothermal gradient of 35 C/km and a mean annual surface temperature of 12.5 C. The radial temperature boundary condition at grid 6, 100 m from the well, is set equal to this geothermal gradient. The pipe wall is neglected in the heat transfer analysis, Figure 2: One-dimensional heat transfer model schematic (not to scale). Randolph, Adams, Kuehn, Saar 4 as its high thermal conductivity offers little resistance to heat transfer compared to the rock. The rock is assumed to have 10% porosity, and conservatively high thermal conductivity and heat capacity are assumed for the effective, combined water-rock system. For a summary of the nomenclature used in the following analysis, see Table 1, and for a full set of model parameters, see Table 2 (Appendix).

A very promising technology to capture CO2 is oxy-combustion. Oxy-combustion offers several advantages over conventional combustion technologies, such as flue gas volume reduction, high combustion efficiency, low fuel consumption and significant reduction in NOx emissions. Liquid fuel is available and it is the most widely used source of energy in the world. Easy handling and transportation, less storage volume and higher flame temperature are some of the features of liquid fuel which give it an upper hand over other sources. In this study, an experimental work on oxygen enriched combustion of ethanol in a vertical reactor by Lacas F. et. al. has been modeled numerically. Non-premixed model using Probability Density Function has been incorporated to simulate the combustion process of ethanol droplets. Predicted combustion characteristics are found to be in good compliance with the experimental data. In addition to this, effects of dilution of carbon-dioxide in oxygen on the flame properties have also been presented. Combustion of ethanol in oxygen-carbon dioxide environment has been compared with that of the conventional air environment.Copyright \u00a9 2014 by ASME", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "4a242914bb36281830ea19d5adf9fd25f4a3dfec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3180584392", "DOI": "10.1071/aj20120", "CorpusId": 237876565}, "title": "Green pivot: can Australia master the hydrogen trade?", "abstract": "\nAustralia is in a bind.

These forests are hypothesized to be more resilient to future abiotic perturbations than fragmented or degraded forests and, therefore, will provide more reliable carbon storage and/or biodiversity services into an uncertain future. Research in the fields of contemporary and palaeoecology can offer valuable insights to enhance our ability to assess resilience of forests and whether these would be comparable across forest biomes. Contemporary ecological monitoring has been able to capture processes acting over the short-to-medium term, while palaeoecological methods allow us to derive insights of the long-term processes affecting forest dynamics. Recent efforts to both identify intact forests, based on area definitions, and assess vegetation climate sensitivity globally have relied on satellite imagery analysis for the time period 2000-2013. In this paper, we compare these published datasets and do find that on average intact forests in boreal and tropical biomes are less sensitive to temperature and water availability, respectively; however, the patterns are less clear within biomes (e.g. across continents). By taking a longer perspective, through palaeoecology, we present several studies that show a range of forest responses to past climatic and human disturbance, suggesting that short-term trends may not be reliable predictors of long-term resilience. We highlight that few contemporary and palaeoecology studies have considered forest area when assessing resilience and those that have did find that smaller forest areas exhibited greater dynamism in species composition, which could be a proxy for declining resilience. Climatic conditions in the Anthropocene will be pushing forest systems across biomes into novel climates very rapidly and with current knowledge it is difficult to predict how forests will react in the immediate term, which is the most relevant timeframe for global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "d6a61e618873ab93f26d8453d8a9892b5f865dff", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s10847-021-01062-w", "CorpusId": 233196055}, "title": "A compare review about equilibrium conditions of semi-clathrate hydrate: experimental measurements visions and thermodynamic modeling aspects", "abstract": "The formation of gaseous (gas) hydrates for storage, separation and transportation application is essential.

However, the fabrication technology for these materials requires high cost and corrosive activating agents such as KOH or ZnCl2 which makes a huge hurdle for their potential commercialization. In this study, a low-cost synthesis strategy is introduced for the preparation of O and N functionalized nanoporous biocarbons using non-corrosive and low-cost potassium citrate as an activating agent and casein as a biomass source via a single-step solid-state procedure. The presence of O functional groups in the activating agent and a large amount of N in the biomass precursor allows not only to successfully incorporate both O and N atoms into the final nanoporous biocarbons but also nanoporosity into the materials. A series of O and N functionalized nanoporous biocarbons with tunable porosity, specific surface area, and pore volume are prepared by varying the amount of the activating agent and the casein. The optimized material CPC-3, which was synthesized using a 1:3 ratio of casein to potassium citrate, showed a high surface area (2212 m2 g-1), a large pore volume (1.11 cm3 g-1), and an appreciable amount of surface oxygen-containing functional groups. With the advantages of excellent surface parameters and the O and N functionalities on the porous surface, the functionalized nanoporous biocarbons achieved a high CO2 adsorption capacity of 25.4 mmol g-1 at 0 \u00b0C and 30 bar and show impressive specific capacitance of 177 F g-1 at 0.5 A g-1 in a three-electrode system in 3M KOH as an electrolyte.

This chapter builds on this work, using TIAM-UCL to investigate the extent to which bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is critical for meeting global CO2 reduction targets under different long-term scenarios out to 2100. The chapter also assesses the potential impacts of BECCS on mitigation costs under various scenarios at a global scale. Though previous work has suggested that BECCs can play a crucial role in meeting the global climate change mitigation target, uncertainties remain in two main areas: one is the availability of biomass, which is affected by many factors including availability of land for biomass production; and the other is sustainability of bioenergy production including consequences for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In order to assess the importance of these uncertainties, this chapter develops several scenarios by varying the availability of biomass (sustainability of the bioenergy production) and peaking year for GHG emissions under 2 \u00b0C and 1.5 \u00b0C climate change mitigation targets at a global level.

Following the importance of the cement industry in Macedonia, a candidate country for EU membership, the present work analyses the potential of CO2 emission reduction in Macedonian cement industry. There are several effective measures which can be applied in cement manufacturing processes to achieve emissions reduction targets. Simultaneously these measures can reduce the local environmental impacts and improve the competitiveness of the cement industry. One of the most effective ways is to capture CO2 from the flue gases and store it. This can reduce carbon emissions by as much as 65\u201370%, but till now there are no industrial scale carbon capture and storage technologies available. By reducing clinker to cement ratio with various additives, CO2 emissions can be reduced substantially. Improving the energy efficiency of the clinker production process is also one of the possibilities for CO2 emissions reduction. However, it was found that the substituting fossil fuels with alternative fuels may play a major role in the reduction of CO2 emissions. All these measures have been analyzed in Macedonian conditions in order to identify their environmental and economic effectiveness.

Quest continuously captures and stores about 1.1Mt of CO2 per year, and it\u2019s expected to continue until 2040. Quest is a dedicated geological storage project (no EOR component) with multiple injectors and monitoring wells. Injection operations started in August 2015 and by May 2018, more than 3Mt of CO2 has been stored using only 2 out of 3 injection wells. Thus far Quest has observed significant injectivity variability with the CO2 bottom-hole temperature. The high-resolution time-series data from the Quest operations gathered over the first 2 years indicate the standard models of CO2 injectivity leave out some important physics. Prior to the start of injection, theoretical CO2 injectivity at the CO2 injector wells was initially modelled and calculated to decrease by ~5% 8% with decreasing CO2 bottom-hole temperature at the wellbore largely due to the increased fluid viscosity at lower temperatures. However, field observations made to date at the Quest CCS site indicate an inverse relationship between CO2 injectivity and bottom-hole temperature where injectivity increases of up to 30% due to cold CO2 have been observed. This paper presents the field observations of injectivity compared to the theoretically expected and modelled 3D isothermal and non-isothermal conditions of injectivity at various CO2 bottom-hole temperatures and discusses the major dominant controlling factors and mechanisms influencing CO2 injectivity at non-isothermal conditions. A full understanding of the non-isothermal processes and their relative impacts on CO2 injectivity are not only crucial for successful deployment of CCS projects but can also have wider beneficial applications in CO2-EOR modelling and operations cost optimisation. * Corresponding author.

To reduce this amount, the IEA announced a goal of sequestering 9 Gt/yr of CO2 by 2050 to maintain a two degree scenario in which the average global temperature rise can be limited to 2 8C. This amounts to a total capture of about 120 Gt of CO2 between 2015 and 2050. A comparison of the difference between the intended nationally determined contributions (INDC) from the most recent Conference of Parties (COP21) in Paris, and the projected 450 scenario (which is a scenario in which there is a 50 % chance of keeping the temperature rise within 2 8C) showed that the INDC pledges were still insufficient to limit global warming to acceptable levels. In mineralization, CO2 is converted into a carbonate form by reaction with a metal ore. When analysing the carbon capture and storage/utilisation/mineralisation processes, three basic factors must be considered. These include stability of the final product and/or the possible re-emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere, the scale of the CO2 capture that is possible, and the cost of the process, and income if any. The change in Gibbs free energy of the process is negative and hence the products are inherently stable (based on reported data ). In addition, it is reported that CO2 mineralisation can be used to potentially capture more than 10,000 Gt of carbon, given the availability of suitable raw materials. 6] This amount is far greater than the 120 Gt (9 Gt/yr) of carbon that must be captured, as recommended by IEA. The main means of disposal of CO2 mineralization products is predicted to be through lowvalue uses such as construction material (roads and buildings), mine filling and/or land reclamation and, hence, CO2 mineralization overall is expected have low revenue streams. In view of this, some CO2 mineralisation technologies are focusing on the high value of the products that are produced and this can potentially offset some of the costs of mineralization. Although the terms \u201cCO2 mineralization\u201d and \u201cmineral carbonation\u201d are popular nowadays, the process was earlier called artificial rock weathering whereby scientists tried to improve the kinetics of a process that occurs in nature.

With the CO2 geological sequestration suitability evaluation indexes and released data, a new CO2 geological sequestration suitability evaluation model is developed based on the unascertained measurement theory and comprehensive weight which is composed of subjective weight and objective weight to reduce the errors arising from employing single weight (either subjective or objective weight) for the evaluation indexes.

The results indicate that the evaluation by the proposed model aligns with the previous study by the consistency of 83.33%.

Operationalizing riparian age [young (<10 years) and mature (>30 years) since establishment] and forest stand type [coniferous and deciduous dominant] to capture the potential extent of plant diversity, we measured plant functional trait diversity (FD) and community weighted mean trait values (CWM), microbial composition, abiotic soil conditions and rates of soil CO2 efflux (mg CO2 -C m-2 h-1 ). We used piecewise structural equation modelling (SEM) to further refine the role of biotic indices (leaf, root and microbial characteristics), and abiotic factors (soil physio-chemical metrics) on soil C cycling processes in riparian systems. We found significantly lower rates of CO2 efflux (F = 8.47; p<0.01) over one growing season and higher total soil C (F = 3.46; p = 0.03) in mature buffers as compared with young buffers.

Within young buffers, soil C content was significantly predicted by fungal:bacterial ratio and root length density, whereas in mature buffers, tree leaf characteristics were associated with soil C content. Soil CO2 efflux was predicted by soil moisture, soil carbon content, and herbaceous root characteristics.

However, the traditional, systematic collection of forest information \u2013 dubbed \u201cforest inventory\u201d \u2013 is time-consuming, expensive, and coarse when compared to novel 3-D measurement technologies. Remote sensing estimates, on the other hand, provide synoptic coverage, but often fail to capture the finescale structural variation of the forest environment. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has demonstrated a potential to address these limitations, but its operational use has remained limited due to unsatisfactory performance characteristics vs. budgetary constraints of many end-users. To address this gap, my dissertation advanced a\u21b5ordable mobile laser scanning capabilities for operational forest structure assessment. We developed geometric reconstruction of forest structure from rapid-scan, low-resolution point cloud data, providing for automatic extraction of standard forest inventory metrics. To augment these results over larger areas, we designed a view-invariant feature descriptor to enable marker-free registration of TLS data pairs, without knowledge of the initial sensor pose. Finally, a graph-theory framework was integrated to perform multi-view registration between a network of disconnected scans, which provided improved assessment of forest inventory variables. This work addresses a major limitation related to the inability of TLS to assess forest structure at an operational scale, and may facilitate improved understanding of the phenomenology of airborne sensing systems, by providing fine-scale reference data with which to interpret the active or passive electromagnetic radiation interactions with forest structure.

The purpose of the research was to establish the influence of material selection on the critical water content required to avoid substantial levels of internal corrosion in an impure supercritical CO2 system containing sulphur dioxide (SO2) and oxygen (O2). Experiments were performed in autoclaves containing supercritical CO2 at 8 MPa and 35\u00b0C in the presence of 100 ppm (mole) SO2 with 20 or 1000 ppm O2 under varying levels of humidity from 0 to 100%. General corrosion rates for all four materials were determined over a period of 48 hours via gravimetric analysis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Raman spectroscopy were all implemented to assist in identifying surface corrosion products. Results from under-saturated experiments indicated that 13Cr steel enables a greater critical water content to be tolerated before corrosion occurs in the presence of 100 ppm SO2 and 20/1000 ppm O2. No corrosion attack was observed at a water content of 650 ppm for 13Cr, while X65, 1Cr and 5Cr produced general corrosion rates of ~0.01 mm/year. At water contents of 1200 ppm, corrosion rates for all materials remained below 0.05 mm/year in the presence of 100 ppm SO2 and 20 ppm O2, with 13Cr again exhibiting superior corrosion resistance. Increasing O2 content to 1000 ppm had no significant effect on corrosion rates in under-saturated conditions. In water-saturated conditions at 100 ppm SO2/20 ppm O2 X65, 1Cr and 5Cr produced dramatically higher corrosion rates in the range of 0.7-0.8mm/year, whilst 13Cr maintained a low corrosion rate below 0.02 mm/year. Changing O2 content to 1000 ppm in water-saturated conditions increased the corrosion rates of X65, 1Cr and 5Cr to ~0.9-1.1 mm/year and that of 13Cr to 0.65mm/year, indicating the material corrosion sensitivity to O2 content. Comparison with previous results by the same authors indicated a noticeable synergy between SO2 and O2 which resulted in a greater degradation rate being observed compared to the sum of individual corrosion rates when SO2 and O2 were present independently at their respective concentrations in the water-saturated system. The research highlights that one option for controlling the corrosion rate under these specific impure supercritical CO2 conditions may be through the implementation of 13Cr, although this may impose a significant cost penalty compared to carbon steels. The work shows that low Cr-bearing steels were unable to mitigate the effects of corrosion compared to X65 steel in these particular water-saturated conditions.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "f95b88b70829e7fd473ac63460aed3778dbd2b88", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1578826667", "CorpusId": 55116370}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage: Selected Economic and Institutional Aspects", "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is the process whereby the combustion of fossil fuels is modified so as to capture the bulk of the CO2 that would otherwise be emitted, compress it, transport it, and then store it permanently in geological formations underground (or under the seabed).

The area is characterized by the upflow of great quantities of geogenic CO2 probably associated to presently extinct Quaternary volcanic activity. The gas originates mainly from crustal sources but has also a minor (~10%) mantle contribution. This strong upflow of nearly pure CO2 can be recognized in industrially exploitable gas reservoirs, high pCO2 shallow groundwaters and surface gas manifestations. But the increased CO2 content has a deleterious impact on groundwater quality. Due to the increased aggressiveness of the low-pH CO2-rich waters with respect to the aquifer rocks, EU drinking water limits are exceed for many parameters (e.g. Electric conductivity, pH, Na, SO4, F, Al, B, Ba, Fe, Mn and Ni).

Shalenormalized profiles show positive La and Y anomalies and Ce negative anomalies probably indicating a main derivation from iron oxyhydroxide dissolution. The positive Eu anomaly evidences also carbonate dissolution while the enrichment in HREE is probably due to the abundant presence of bicarbonate, which increases HREE solubility through complexation.

Therefore, his scientific contribution considers the possible beneficial use of this CO2 in the production of concrete blocks in both short and long term performances. Carbon sequestration in concrete is based on the components presents in the cement. Thus, the carbonates are obtained by the reaction between calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) and the CO2 and form a more thermodynamically stable compound. This principle of CO2 fixation requires the establishment, at the young age of concrete, of a curing process accelerated that is realized in a special room. Carbon dioxide is injected in that room by entering a microstructure to ensure complete carbonation of the cement paste.

Understanding and identifying the relevant geological processes over long time scales can be obtained only at natural-analogue sites. At one such site, in the Salt Wash Graben area of Utah, USA, widespread bleaching affects the Middle Jurassic red-bed \u201cwet dune\u201d Entrada Sandstone. Previous work has proposed a genetic link between the bleaching and spatially concomitant recent and modern CO2-rich fluids. The results presented here challenge some of the previous models and come from a detailed petrographic examination of mineralized fractures in the Entrada Sandstone that are centered in vertical extensions to the bleaching. These fractures typically contain complex mineralization assemblages. Pyrite was a paragenetically early phase, identifiable from common pseudomorphs of mixed iron oxides and oxyhydroxides that rarely contain relict pyrite. The pyrite contains up to 3 wt% arsenic. The volume of fracture-adjacent bleached sandstone is sufficient to have been the source of iron for the pyrite originally present in the fracture. The pyrite pseudomorphs occur at the center of fracture- and pore-filling cements that comprise intergrowths of hematite\u2013goethite\u2013jarosite\u2013gypsum, an assemblage that suggests that their formation resulted from the oxidative alteration of pyrite, a genetic link supported by the arsenic present in the iron-bearing minerals. The presence of jarosite and proximal removal of earlier, sandstone-hosted carbonates are consistent with, and indicative of, the low-pH conditions associated with pyrite oxidation reactions. Calcite- and gypsum-cemented fractures crosscut, and contain fragments of, the pyrite-pseudomorphic and -oxidation assemblages, proving that they postdate pyrite formation and its subsequent oxidation, and that pyrite oxidation was not a result of modern weathering reactions. In outcrop, some calcite- and gypsum-cemented fractures link with travertine deposits associated with the modern and recent CO2-rich fluids. The mineral assemblages observed here, and the paragenetic sequence that we have inferred, suggest that the fracture-associated bleaching patterns result from the fracture-fed movement of sulfur-bearing reducing fluids, with hydrogen sulfide the most likely bleaching agent. We conclude that bleaching adjacent to fractures is not genetically related to modern CO2-bearing fluids despite the spatial relationship. The bleaching was already present when the modern fluids utilized the same fracture-based fluid pathways. We suggest that the more widespread regional bleaching formed contemporaneously with the fracture bleaching and followed similar mechanisms.

Carbon dioxide can be sequestered underground in oil and gas reservoirs, in deep saline aquifers, in uneconomic coal beds and in salt caverns. The sedimentary succession in northeastern British Columbia has significant potential for CO2 storage in gas reservoirs and deep saline aquifers. This is because geologically this region is located in a tectonically stable area, has significant, large gas reservoirs, and deep saline aquifers that are confined by thick, regional-scale shaly aquitards. In addition, there is significant infrastructure in place, there are several large CO2-sources in the area, including high-purity sources (gas plants), and there is operational and regulatory experience with acid gas disposal in both depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and deep saline aquifers.

This capacity, just by itself, is likely sufficient to cover B.C.\u2019s needs for this century. The CO2 storage capacity in oil reservoirs is practically negligible at 5 Mt CO2, and the only reason that this capacity would ever be realized is that additional oil may be produced in CO2EOR operations. Storage of CO2 in coal beds does not have potential unless used in conjunction with coal gas recovery (technology that has yet to be proven), and even then it is questionable given the depth of the coal beds. Besides gas reservoirs, northeastern British Columbia has significant potential for CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers. Carbon dioxide can be injected into almost all of the deep saline aquifers in the sedimentary succession. The only aquifers that are not suitable for CO2 storage are the shallower Upper Cretaceous Dunvegan and Cardium formations, which crop out at river valleys as a result of Tertiary to Recent erosion. Cambrian to Lower Cretaceous aquifers are well confined by intervening and overlying shales. Geographically, Carboniferous to Triassic aquifers are the best targets for CO2 storage in the southern part of northeastern British Columbia, while Devonian aquifers should be used for CO2 storage in the northern part. Although there is great capacity and potential infrastructure for CO2 storage in gas reservoirs, they will become available for CO2 storage only after depletion, which, at current production rates, will occur in the next few decades. Until they become available, deep saline aquifers can be safely used for CO2 storage in northeastern British Columbia.

A still increasing interest and emphasis on the sessile bacterial lifestyle biofilms has been seen since it was realized that that less than 0.1% of the total microbial biomass lives in the planktonic mode of growth. The term was coined in 1978 by Costerton et al. who defined the term biofilm for the first time.In 1993 the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) recognised that the biofilmmode of growth was relevant to microbiology. Lately many articles have been published on the clinical implications of bacterial biofilms. Both original articles and reviews concerning the biofilm problem are available.Annual Reports on NMR Spectroscopy, Volume 97, provides an in-depth accounting of progress in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and its many applications. In recent years, no other technique has gained as much significance. It is used in all branches of science in which precise structural determination is required, and in which the nature of interactions and reactions in solution is being studied. This book has established itself as a premier resource for both specialists and non-specialists who are looking to become familiar with new techniques and applications pertaining to NMR spectroscopy. Serves as the premier resource for learning the new techniques and applications of NMR spectroscopy Provides a key reference for chemists and physicists using NMR spectroscopy to study the structure and dynamics of molecules Covers all aspects of molecular science, including MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)This book explains the formation of biofilm on materials surfaces in an industrial setting. The authors describe new developments in understanding of biofilm formation, detection, and control from the viewpoint of materials science and engineering. The book details the range of issues caused by biofilm formation and the variety of affected industries.This book serves as a manual of research techniques for electrochemically active biofilm research. Using examples from real biofilm research to illustrate the techniques used for electrochemically active biofilms, this book is of most use to researchers and educators studying microbial fuel cell and bioelectrochemical systems. The book emphasizes the theoretical principles of bioelectrochemistry, experimental procedures and tools useful in quantifying electron transfer processes in biofilms, and mathematical modeling of electron transfer in biofilms. It is divided into three sections: Biofilms: Microbiology and microbioelectrochemistry Focuses on the microbiologic aspect of electrochemically active biofilms and details the key points of biofilm preparation and electrochemical measurement Electrochemical techniques to study electron transfer processes Focuses on electrochemical characterization and data interpretation, highlighting key factors in the experimental procedures that affect reproducibility Applications Focuses on applications of electrochemically active biofilms and development of custom tools to study electrochemically active biofilms.

Biocorrosion is a major problem in areas such as cooling systems and marine structures where biofilms can develop. This book summarises key recent research in this subject. Part one looks at theories of biocorrosion and measurement techniques. Part two discusses how bacteria and biofilms result in biocorrosion. The final part of the book includes case studies of biocorrosion in areas as diverse as buildings, fuels, marine environments and cooling systems. Provides a detailed overview of biocorrosion and the different scientific and/or industrial problems related to microbially induced corrosion Introduces a variety of investigative techniques and methodologies that are employed in diagnosing and evaluating microbially induced corrosion Includes case studies on: biodeterioration of building materials; biocorrosion issues associated with diesel and biofuels; marine biocorrosion; corrosion of open recirculating cooling water systems and cooling system components; the effect of H2S on steel corrosionThe Microbiology of Nuclear Waste Disposal is a state-of-the-art reference featuring contributions focusing on the impact of microbes on the safe long-term disposal of nuclear waste. This book is the first to cover this important emerging topic, and is written for a wide audience encompassing regulators, implementers, academics, and other stakeholders. The book is also of interest to those working on the wider exploitation of the subsurface, such as bioremediation, carbon capture and storage, geothermal energy, and water quality. Planning for suitable facilities in the U.S., Europe, and Asia has been based mainly on knowledge from the geological and physical sciences. However, recent studies have shown that microbial life can proliferate in the inhospitable environments associated with radioactive waste disposal, and can control the long-term fate of nuclear materials. This can have beneficial and damaging impacts, which need to be quantified.

This is traditionally thought to be true for the costs of CO2 capture (i.e., excluding costs of transport and storage). Such costs are discussed in terms of the cost reductions that can be realized going from first-of-a-kind (FOAK) capture facilities to facilities that take advantage of more mature technologies, practices, and experience, the so-called nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) facilities. This situation exists for CO2 storage as well, though perhaps not in quite the same way. Many have commented that the costs of operations specific to CO2 storage in the demonstration projects conducted to date have been considerably higher than anticipated. Therefore, a systematic assessment is necessary to understand how these might evolve, with associated cost reductions, as more CCS deployment takes place, especially at commercial scale. This paper first develops and characterizes the costs associated with conducting CO2 storage today, under current regulatory requirements, and using existing technologies and practices, with focus paid to the costs associated with storage, monitoring, and verification (SMV), and their contribution to the overall costs of CO2 storage (FOAK costs). Next, the paper characterizes how evolving regulatory requirements and expectations, technology applications and performance, operator and regulator experience, proper attention to risk characterization and assessment, and knowledge of best practices can potentially lead to cost reductions in various SMV activities, as more CCS projects get deployed (NOAK costs). The paper characterizes the potential issues and estimated costs associated with FOAK to NOAK evolution for three \u201crepresentative\u201d CO2 storage cases: \u2022 Onshore CO2 storage project in a saline aquifer in the U.S. Gulf Coast \u2022 Onshore CO2-EOR project converted to a CO2 storage project in the U.S. Permian Basin \u2022 CO2 storage in association with onshore CO2-EOR projects (in four U.S. regions). For this effort, the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Fossil Energy/National Energy Technology Laboratory (FE/NETL) CO2 Saline Storage Cost Model was used as the integrating costing and financial analysis framework for estimating life-cycle storage costs. The analyses assumed compliance with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) requirements for Class VI CO2 injection wells or Class II CO2 injection wells for enhanced recovery (where applicable) for geologic storage of CO2, along with USEPA emissions reporting requirements under its Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The paper summarizes the application of a risk-based approach that involves stakeholders in defining thresholds of measured quantities at the specific storage site. In this approach, threshold levels of potential leakage are modelled, establishing detection capability and potential attribution. A variety of leakage pathways are considered, including existing well bores, faults and fractures, natural and induced seismic activity, previous operations, pipeline/surface equipment, lateral", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "e2c188ef1f039a40f40edd85535b5603565191af", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2460931713", "CorpusId": 156655387}, "title": "From weak to strong sustainable development : an analysis of Norwegian economic policy tools in mitigating climate change", "abstract": "This thesis focuses on the economlC concepts of weak and strong sustainable development in relation to mitigating climate change. The overall research question is how to move from weak towards strong sustainable development. The case studied is Norwegian economic policy tools in relation to the petroleum industry. In the mam part of the thesis, vanous aspects of weak and strong sustainable development are analysed: methodology, ontology, ethics and historical background. This part constructs the foundation for the following three papers, which all three contribute to answer the overall research question. Paper 1 uses circulation economics to illustrate the circular process of carbon capture and storage (CCS). The research questions are regarding how circulation economics and strong sustainable development can contribute to the preconditions for CCS. The situation today remains however, generally speaking, a long way away from recognizing strong sustainable development as an alternative to weak sustainable development. A rare exception is the arena of paper 2, the Ethical Guidelines for the Norwegian Government Pension Fund Global. The income to the Fund originates from the Norwegian petroleum industry, and the Fund is a potentially powerful policy instrument, controlling a huge part of the world's financial assets. The research questions of this paper analyse mitigating climate change in relation to the existing ethical base of the Ethical Guidelines, overlapping consensus. Moreover, an alternative base discourse ethics is suggested, to address mitigating climate change in a more firm manner. In paper 3, a theoretical model is constructed to make communication and cooperation between weak and strong sustainable development more even, than is detected in paper l and 2. The model is called reflexive sustainable development, and is to move the situation of today towards strong sustainable development.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "0926582559cd59402e1e1fae95c5f242dfc8be36", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1487247140", "DOI": "10.2172/981333", "CorpusId": 128867172}, "title": "Mult-Pollutant Control Through Novel Approaches to Oxygen Enhanced Combustion", "abstract": "Growing concerns about global climate change have focused effortss on identifying approaches to stabilizing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.

They work through a controlled modulation between a storage phase that captures NOx over an alkali earth metal and a regeneration phase that reduces the stored nitrates on the surface using a rich pulse of injected fuel or via stoichiometric engine operation. This rich phase has an associated fuel penalty while being relatively difficult to control through temperature and chemical species. In order to improve system efficiency, a number of researchers have proposed dual leg LNT systems using two LNTs, one of which is always storing while the other is undergoing regeneration. The majority of the exhaust flows through the storage LNT while only a small fraction (low space velocity) advects across the regeneration LNT. This increases the regeneration residence time, improving effectiveness and decreasing the amount of fuel used. From an LNT simulation standpoint, most researchers utilize the classical one-dimensional (1D) aftertreatment model constructed from the Euler equations of motion that neglect axial conduction and diffusion. This paper explores the applicability of this model under low flow situations prevalent in a dual leg LNT system through a carbon monoxide light-off experiment. The authors chose this type of experiment in order to focus purely on fluid mechanics and not the choice of LNT reaction mechanism. The results suggest that a Navier\u2013Stokes (N\u2013S) version of the 1D aftertreatment model is preferred for the regeneration leg of a dual LNT system. Moreover, the authors provide the solution of such a model within this paper.", "year": 2013}]}
