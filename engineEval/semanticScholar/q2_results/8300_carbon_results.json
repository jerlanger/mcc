The CCUS process comprises four steps, namely: capture, compression, transport, utilization and storage. Capture technologies take three different forms: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture and oxy-fuel combustion. Compared to the other two technologies, post-combustion capture is relatively easier to implement, as it can be retrofitted for existing plants, because it does not require that radical changes to the plants be made [1]. Competing methods for post-combustion carbon capture include absorption, cryogenic fractionation and membrane-centered methods [2, 3]. Absorption processes are well-known and commonly used in the chemical industry. Thus, it is predicted that in the near future, chemical absorption using monoethanolamine (MEA) will play an essential role in capturing CO2 from flue gases in power plants [4]. Contending with chemical absorption, gas separation membranes offer advantages in their potential for less environmental impact, since an additional environmental externality is solvent degradation. Furthermore, membrane modules can be utilized as add-on equipment, requiring fewer modifications to power plants. The other potential advantage is that for low degrees of CO2 separation, a stage-arranged membrane system demands a lower specific energy than that required for MEA absorption [5, 6]. Correspondingly, many groups and researchers around the world are involved in the material and process development of this method. Although some processes [5, 7-9] have been explored with consideration to their energetic and economic aspects, no detailed simulation of the exhaust heat integration of the capture system with power plants has yet been performed. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential for reducing the net efficiency decrease by means of an optimal integration of the CO2 capture process into a power plant. Two commercial simulation tools, EBSILON \u00ae Professional (power plant) and ASPEN Plus \u00ae (membrane capture process, CO2 compressor), are used. The model developed here is based on the study \u201cReference Power Plant North-Rhine-Westphalia\u201d (RPP-NRW) [10]. After SCR-DeNOx, dust removal (E-filter) and desulphurization (FGD), the flue gas has a pressure of approximately 1 atm and temperature of 50-70 oC. The Reference Power Plant NRW was designed to achieve a net efficiency of almost 46%. Ultra-supercritical steam conditions are characterized by 285 bar and 600 \u00b0C for the main steam, with 60 bar and 620 \u00b0C for the reheated steam conditions. Investigations into membrane-based, post-combustion CO2 capture process confirm that the process requires auxiliary power for vacuum pumps and compressors involved. These additional energy demands cause a decrease in the net efficiency of a power plant\u2019s operation.

Increasing concern about climate change has necessitated the assessment of ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO 2), while concurrently increasing our preparedness for climate change and variability. For example, in 2007, the Minnesota Legislature set goals to reduce state emissions 15% by 2015, 30% by 2025, and 80% by 2050. These reductions can be achieved by reducing fossil fuel combustion, by reducing other activity that generates greenhouse gases, by averting venting of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and by recovering greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, for example in the form of enhanced biomass and soil carbon. Over one-third of Minnesota CO 2 emissions are derived from stationary sources such as coal-fired electrical generating stations and ethanol plants, and technology is now available to capture CO 2 from these sources. The likely fate of the captured CO 2 , should this occur, would be storage by geologic sequestration, also known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), either by injection into deep saline underground geologic formations, or by mineral carbonation, which is reaction of CO 2 with mineral material to produce a benign solid product. A conceivable deep injection option for Minnesota is export of CO 2 by pipeline to one or more potentially willing jurisdictions such as North Dakota or Illinois, where apparently suitable geologic repositories have been confirmed. It is possible, however, that saline formations in Minnesota could be confirmed as geologic CO 2 repositories, possibly enabling carbon storage by deep injection without the requirement for negotiations with neighboring jurisdictions and export by pipeline. The only rocks in Minnesota that potentially have the required reservoir properties below about a kilometer depth, the depth required for efficient CO 2 storage, are sequences of sedimentary rocks associated with the Midcontinent Rift, a southwestward extension of the Lake Superior basin that extends to Kansas. Criteria for confirmation of geologic potential include depth, porosity, permeability, presence of a seal, integrity relative to previous drilling or fractures, appropriate chemistry relative to lack of drinking water potential and chemical trapping mechanisms, and adequate data availability.

The results from BSA allowed the identification of main gaps and strengths for all storage units in the Lusitanian basin.

A significant difference between CO2 storage in coal seams and storage in saline aquifers is that the incrementally recovered natural gas constitutes an additional revenue stream. In the case of CO2 storage in coal it is necessary to distinguish between CBM (primary coalbed methane recovery), CO2-ECBM (enhanced coalbed methane recovery caused by and including the injection of CO2), and CO2 storage with incremental CBM recovery (Storage-ICBM) The methodology is demonstrated by means of a case study that evaluates the economics of carbon capture and storage with incremental CBM recovery (CCS-ICBM) at the Spring Gully CBM prospect in the Bowen Basin, QLD, Australia Australia\u2019s most productive CBM basin. Economic analyses of the Spring Gully development show that the specific cost of CO2-ECBM is A$37/t CO2 avoided (equivalent to US$31/t at an assumed long term exchange rate of A$1.00 = US$0.85) including capture costs. However, this incorporates the benefits of the underlying CBM project and therefore underestimates the cost of CCS-ICBM. The incremental cost of CCS-ICBM is A$92/t (US$78/t) excluding these benefits. The results demonstrate the importance of using an appropriate methodology to determine and present storage economics. If no distinction between CO2-ECBM and Storage-ICBM is made, the real costs of storage will for most cases be significantly underestimated and could potentially lead to poor investment decisions and the selection of economically unviable storage sites. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

We developed an approach for rapid mapping of aboveground C density (ACD; units\u00a0=\u00a0Mg or metric tons\u00a0C\u00a0ha\u22121) on islands at a spatial resolution of 30\u00a0m (0.09\u00a0ha) using a combination of cost-effective airborne LiDAR data and full-coverage satellite data. We used the approach to map forest ACD across the main Hawaiian Islands, comparing C stocks within and among islands, in protected and unprotected areas, and among forests dominated by native and invasive species.ResultsTotal forest aboveground C stock of the Hawaiian Islands was 36 Tg, and ACD distributions were extremely heterogeneous both within and across islands. Remotely sensed ACD was validated against U.S. Forest Service FIA plot inventory data (R2\u00a0=\u00a00.67; RMSE\u00a0=\u00a030.4\u00a0Mg\u00a0C\u00a0ha\u22121). Geospatial analyses indicated the critical importance of forest type and canopy cover as predictors of mapped ACD patterns. Protection status was a strong determinant of forest C stock and density, but we found complex environmentally mediated responses of forest ACD to alien plant invasion.ConclusionsA combination of one-time airborne LiDAR data acquisition and satellite monitoring provides effective forest C mapping in the highly heterogeneous landscapes of the Hawaiian Islands. Our statistical approach yielded key insights into the drivers of ACD variation, and also makes possible future assessments of C storage change, derived on a repeat basis from free satellite data, without the need for additional LiDAR data. Changes in C stocks and densities of oceanic islands can thus be continually assessed in the face of rapid environmental changes such as biological invasions, drought, fire and land use.

There is nothing more expensive: the food system delivers cheap food, but it takes no account of the damage done along the way. It operates in three modes. In Mode 1, farmers manage land and water to produce crops and livestock. Incidentally, they manage the landscape and carbon capture from the atmosphere by crops and its conversion to soil organic matter. Soil organic matter matters: it fuels the world of the soil that breaks down wastes and toxins, regenerates crop nutrients and controls pests and diseases; it maintains soil structure that enables infiltration and storage of rainfall; and it holds more carbon than the atmosphere and all standing vegetation put together. If these services are considered at all, they\u2019re taken for granted. Nowadays, Mode 1 accounts for only one-tenth of the value added in the food system; farm-gate prices have been driven down relentlessly so farms have had to get bigger or get out. Production certainly benefits from economies of scale and the gifts of technology: ever-more-powerful machines, new crop varieties, fertilisers, pesticides, irrigation\u2014but these gifts exact a cost by exposing topsoil to the elements, turning it upside down with every pass of the plough and raiding soil organic matter. So, more power and more chemicals are needed; soil erosion, floods and droughts are exacerbated; groundwater isn\u2019t recharged; and agriculture burns up more energy than it harvests. None of this is accounted in the cost of food but, over millennia, agriculture has amassed rights and vested interests that have resisted reforms that could take these costs into account. In the second mode, food is traded, processed and retailed; these activities now account for most of the value added in the food system. Comprehensive legal foundations and accounting rules that have been impossible to install in primary production have proven politically feasible in trade, processing and retail. In the third mode, food consumption, public policy again overrides the market to enable poor people to get food that is still too costly for them. The system is unsustainable\u2014ecologically, environmentally and economically.

A 40-mile range is sufficient to cover 75 percent of the light-vehicle driving in the United States. Because the PEV is a hybrid, it will have increased efficiency; and, if used with a diesel engine, a doubling of efficiency should be easily achievable with present technology. This would result in roughly Taking a longer view, the complete elimination of fossil fuel use is eventually inevitable. At that point, trucks and automobiles will be powered by electricity\u2014from batteries or fuel cells\u2014and by biofuels. Electricity will likely be produced by wind turbines, solar energy and nuclear power. HFCVs will then require the production of hydrogen by electrolysis, or a high-temperature process with advanced nuclear reactors. Assuming 70% efficiency for electrolysis or a high temperature process, and 70% efficiency for the fuel cell, the latter being a rather optimistic value, yields 49% efficiency for the conversion of bulk electricity to on-board electricity. Of course this ignores the need to pressurize and transport the hydrogen. By contrast, charging and discharging a battery is over 90% efficient. For this reason, the long-run dominance of HFCV technology over battery technology looks unlikely. However, this conclusion could be reversed by the development of cheap artificial photosynthesis for the production of hydrogen. In the medium term, say between 2050 and 2075, hydrogen could possibly, although by no means certainly, dominate a combination of batteries, efficiency and biofuels. It should, however, be remembered that, unlike cellulosic ethanol and engine efficiency improvements, HFCVs will not automatically do much to reduce CO2 emissions. There must be an additional policy requiring carbon capture when hydrogen is produced from fossil fuels. At present, there is no case for tipping the balance towards a hydrogen transition. As the NRC explains, there is a \u201cdownside risk of pushing HFCVs (or any other specific technologies) before they are really ready or if they turn out not to be the best option, which could be extremely expensive and disruptive.\u201d There is also no proof that hydrogen is the most likely long-run solution. There exists, however, an excellent case for the present R&D effort in hydrogen technology. There is a modest chance that it could provide an enormous payoff. For example, it is possible that batteries and cellulosic ethanol will remain too expensive to be practical, and that breakthroughs in fuel-cell and hydrogen storage technologies will bring HFCVs to market sooner and more profitably than expected. And perhaps recent breakthroughs in artificial photosynthesis will eventually make solar-hydrogen the fuel of choice. Funding such high-risk advanced R&D is something the market does poorly. Because of this, the government should support hydrogen research, and quite likely at a higher level than the current one. That is the case for hydrogen. It is also the case for funding all of hydrogen\u2019s competitors, or as the NRC (2008b) says, taking a \u201cportfolio approach.\u201d an 87% reduction in gasoline use. That is considerably better than what the NRC predicts could be achieved by HFCVs by 2050 under its optimistic Case 1. 2 The situation does not seem to be clearer in the short run, between now and 2050. For instance, the NRC\u2019s (2008b) Conclusion 14 states that \u201cadvanced conventional vehicles and biofuels\u2014have the potential to provide significant reductions in projected oil imports and CO2 emissions. ... [but] the deepest cuts in oil use and CO2 emissions after about 2040 would come from hydrogen.\u201d But this conclusion has been weakened by assuming that the future will bring only advanced conventional vehicles or biofuels, but not both. In fact the NRC (2008b) reports (see Figures 6.29 and 6.30) what happens if both improvements are realized. In this case HFCVs do not provide deeper cuts in either oil or emissions until after 2050. This conclusion only includes on what the NRC considers \u201cevolutionary\u201d technology.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "db951a2e1da5e620e7cf4866b4bada21a60cc828", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3390/en15010344", "CorpusId": 245810726}, "title": "Study on the Influential Factors of CO2 Storage in Low Permeability Reservoir", "abstract": "As the demands of tight-oil Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and the controlling of anthropogenic carbon emission have become global challenges, Carbon Capture Utilization and Sequestration (CCUS) has been recognized as an effective solution to resolve both needs. However, the influential factors of carbon dioxide (CO2) geological storage in low permeability reservoirs have not been fully studied. Based on core samples from the Huang-3 area of the Ordos Basin, the feasibility and influential factors of geological CO2 sequestration in the Huang-3 area are analyzed through caprock breakthrough tests and a CO2 storage factor experiment. The results indicate that capillary trapping is the key mechanism of the sealing effect by the caprock. With the increase of caprock permeability, the breakthrough pressure and pressure difference decreased rapidly. A good exponential relationship between caprock breakthrough pressure and permeability can be summarized. The minimum breakthrough pressure of CO2 in the caprock of the Huang-3 area is 22 MPa, and the breakthrough pressure gradient is greater than 100 MPa/m. Huang-3 area is suitable for the geological sequestration of CO2, and the risk of CO2 breakthrough in the caprock is small. At the same storage percentage, the recovery factor of crude oil in larger permeability core is higher, and the storage percentage decreases with the increase of recovery factor. It turned out that a low permeability reservoir is easier to store CO2, and the storage percentage of carbon dioxide in the miscible phase is greater than that in the immiscible phase. This study can provide empirical reference for caprock selection and safety evaluation of CO2 geological storage in low permeability reservoirs within Ordos Basin.", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "836d6b7bdfd6dca857749db35490a95accd7612c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1566315680", "CorpusId": 153530897}, "title": "The EU climate policy perspectives and their implications for Belgium", "abstract": "This paper estimates the impact on Belgium of the EU climate policy.

One reference scenario and four scenarios with different assumptions for nuclear and carbon capture and storage were taken into account for the Belgian TIMES model. For this CO2 emission reduction objective, the crucial changes are a decrease in the growth of the demand for energy services (e.g. tonnes of steel, km driven) and a strong increase in the level of investments in low carbon technologies. A shift towards more energy efficient technologies is important in all scenarios.

The charge-transfer current of the cases containing 100 ppmw sulfurous acid was higher than these without sulfurous acid at the same pH, and the cathodic limiting currents increased.

This new \"wave\" was most likely caused by the direct reduction of sulfurous acid or bisulfite on the steel surface.

The purpose of the present work is the study of shaft sealing in the framework of CO2 storage projects. More precisely the problem consists in the numerical study, with the LAGAMINE nite elements code, of gas transfers around a shaft seal system. A coupled hydro-mechanical model of unsaturated geomaterials is presented. The response of the ow model is rst studied through a simple synthetic problem simulating the injection of gas in a concrete-made column. It stands out of this rst modeling that the advection of the gas phase represents the main transfer mechanism of CO2 in highly unsaturated materials. Furthermore the setting of a bentonite barrier seal allows limiting considerably gas in ux to the biosphere.

We have linked net primary production (NPP) algorithms, which include the impact of enhanced atmospheric CO2 on plant growth, to the SOCRATES terrestrial carbon model to estimate changes in SOC for the Australia continent between the years 1990 and 2100 in response to climate changes generated by the CSIRO Mark 2 Global Circulation Model (GCM).ResultsWe estimate organic carbon storage in the topsoil (0\u201310 cm) of the Australian continent in 1990 to be 8.1 Gt. This equates to 19 and 34 Gt in the top 30 and 100 cm of soil, respectively. By the year 2100, under a low emissions scenario, topsoil organic carbon stores of the continent will have increased by 0.6% (49 Mt C).

Main advantages of the DMX TM process are: Higher cyclic capacity than MEA: from 0.1 to 1 mol CO2/mol solvent which allows very low solvent flow rate and by consequence lower heat required for regeneration (less than 2.5 GJ/tCO2); No degradation of the DMX TM solvents (up to 160\u00b0C): so regeneration can be operated under pressure and CO2 may be produced at higher pressure (up to 6-7 bara); The DMX TM solvent is not corrosive: Carbon Steel may be used as material for the DMX TM process; Same CAPEX as for first-generation processes using amine-based solvents; But up to 30 % reduction in OPEX. Experimentation on minipilots and techno-economic evaluation carried out within the OCTAVIUS & VALORCO projects [4, 5] have confirmed its potential in terms of reduction of energy penalty and operational costs for capturing CO2 respectively on coal power-station and blast furnace gas.

Monitoring the injected CO2 distribution is at the core of any carbon capture and storage project. Waveform inversion methods can be used to obtain high-resolution images for monitoring the injected CO2 in the subsurface, but remains computationally challenging. Efficient modelling approximations are desirable for solving time-lapse inversion problems and to test the settings in which they give accurate predictions. We employed the distorted Born approximation (based on scattering integral equation) to simulate time-lapse synthetic data for a CO2 injection scenario with a single injector, and benchmarked it against the finite element and exact T-matrix approach. The distorted Born approximation presented, considers a general heterogeneous reference medium; and provides a framework for imaging of regions of time-lapse variation using the baseline survey as a reference and the monitor survey as perturbed to directly estimate the perturbation. Based on our simplified velocity model of CO2 injection, synthetic testing demonstrated that the new distorted Born approximation provides accurate predictions of the difference data seismograms.

Gabriel, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Government acquisitions requiring research and development (R&D) efforts are fraught with uncertainty. The risks are often mitigated by employing a multi-stage competition, with multiple projects funded initially until a single successful project is selected. While decision-makers recognize they are using a real options approach, analytical tools are often unavailable to evaluate optimal decisions. The use of these techniques for R&D project selection to reduce the uncertainties has been shown to increase overall project value. This dissertation first presents an efficient stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) approach that managers can use to determine optimal project selection strategies and apply the proposed approach on illustrative numerical examples. While the SDP approach produces optimal solutions for many applications, this approach does not easily accommodate the inclusion of a budget-optimal allocation or side constraints, since its formulation is scenario specific. Thus, we then formulate an integer program (IP), whose solution set is equivalent to the SDP model, but facilitates the incorporation of these features and can be solved using available commercial IP solvers. The one-level IP formulation can solve what is otherwise a nested two-level problem when solved as an SDP. We then compare the performance of both models on differently sized problems. For larger problems, where the IP approach appears to be untenable, we provide heuristics for the two-level SDP formulation to solve problems efficiently. Finally, we apply these methods to carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects in the European Union currently under development that may be subject to public funding. Taking the perspective of a funding agency, we employ the real options models presented in this dissertation for determining optimal funding strategies for CCS project selection. The models demonstrate the improved risk reduction by employing a multi-stage competition and explicitly consider the benefits of knowledge spillover generated by competing projects. We then extend the model to consider two sensitivities: 1) the flexibility to spend the budget among the time periods and 2) optimizing the budget, but specifying each time period\u2019s allocation a priori. State size, scenario reduction heuristics and run-times of the models are provided.

In addition to being a leading energy producer, the PRB is the site of research programs whose aim is to develop and integrate low-carbon technologies into existing fossil fuel energy industries. Much of the PRB\u2019s low-carbon research is focused around Dry Fork Station (DFS), which is the newest coal-fired power station in the western US. Currently, DFS hosts five carbon capture projects, including pilot-scale capture projects that utilize different capture technologies and a full front-end engineering and design (FEED) study, a commercial CO2 pipeline for nearby CO2-enhanced oil recovery industry, and is also co-located with the Wyoming Integrated Test Center, which is a host facility for unconventional carbon utilization research (i.e. flue gas carbon-to-products innovations). DFS is also the host site for the Wyoming CarbonSAFE project. Wyoming CarbonSAFE, funded by the Department of Energy/National Energy Technology Laboratory, is a multi-phased program (currently in Phase II) whose core objective is developing and validating storage sites within a complex capable of storing 50 million metric tonnes of CO2 over a 30 year project period using carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS). This paper will provide an overview of the project to-date, showing that CarbonSAFE goals are achievable with respect to geologic, environmental, regulatory, CO2 source and economic conditions, and why the State of Wyoming offers one of the more favorable environments to advance the commercialization studies. \n \nIn 2019, the project team designed and completed a ~10,000 foot stratigraphic test well just south of DFS. From this well, the team collected over 600 feet of core, fluid samples from target injection zones, and a full petrophysical log suite. In addition, legacy 2D seismic lines were acquired and a 3D seismic survey was acquired in the fall of 2020. The objective of these field activities has been to identify and characterize target storage reservoirs and associated caprock. This complex has several reservoirs that could meet commercial injection goals, and over 4000 feet of associated caprock. Simulations of site performance suggest that stacked injection provides the most effective storage strategy, and would necessitate several sites within the greater complex to meet final project injection goals. Other work within this project includes the development of a business-case around proximal fields with CO2-enhanced oil recovery potential and existing tax credits, assessment of regulatory conditions, including pore space ownership and Class VI injection well permitting requirements, implementation of a robust public outreach program, and surface site characterization activities that have focused on environmental factors. In the PRB and at DFS, the State of Wyoming and other entities have made carbon management a priority of its future energy industry by providing a regulatory and business framework that is favorable to advancing these technologies.

Current methods of generating energy for the industrial civilization undermine local, regional, global environmental conditions, and are based mainly on the processing of fossil resources. Nowadays, the dawn of a new renewable energy revolution is occurring. It is the use of hydrogen instead of using oil and its derivatives. The stakes are global. The fight against the greenhouse effect requires finding a solution for the production of green energy. The relatively new method of producing electricity is based on conversion, in fuel cells, of heat and energy of certain chemical substances, in electricity. Since fuel cells convert fuel directly in electricity two to three times more efficiently than the thermodynamic conversion, the fuel cell is, by definition, a very efficient technology and, being a potential source of high energy still, clean and, compatible with renewable energy policy, reliable and sustainable over time (does not contain moving parts). Hydrogen is the key to the future of energy having the highest energy content per unit weight of all known fossil. When burned in an engine, hydrogen produces zero issues; when the power source in a fuel cell, clean waters it is the only residue at 250-300 oC (International Atomic Energy Agency, [IAEA], 1999; OhtaV Veziroglu, 2000). Combined with other technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, renewable energies, fusion energy, it is possible that the fuel cell will generate in future energies without harmful programs. Hydrogen is the only energy carrier making it possible to drive an aircraft using solar energy. At the beginning of the XXIst century it is assumed that fuel cells will become a pervasive technology; hydrogen as fuel is becoming increasingly presented as the \"solution\", also by carmakers, ecologists, and governments who do not want to impose unpopular measures to limit car traffic. The use of hydrogen will extend from cell phones to electric power plants. Implementing the \"hydrogen economy\" will lead to changes not seen in the XIX century and early XX century when the world went through the experience of the last energy revolution.

Considering ~230,000 ha in California (8.2% of total land cultivated in CA) are dedicated to wine grape production, annual C capture and storage in woody biomass is substantial. In this study, destructive sampling was used to measure C stocks in the woody biomass of a 15-year-old Cabernet Sauvignon vines from a California Northern San Joaquin Valley vineyard. The objectives were to characterize C stocks in terms of allometric variation between biomass fractions of roots, aboveground wood, canes, leaves and fruit, and then test correlations between easy-to-measure variables such as trunk diameter, pruning weights and harvest index to vine biomass fractions. Carbon stocks were also estimated from the volume of biomass in mounds generated during vineyard removal, and compared with previous estimates of standing biomass.Total vine C was estimated at 12.3 Mg C/ha, of which 8.9 Mg C/ha came from perennial vine biomass, whereas annual biomass was estimated at 1.7 Mg C/ha from leaves and canes and 1.7 Mg C/ha from fruit. High positive correlations were found between the diameter of the trunk and overall woody C stocks (r2 = 0.84), pruning weights and annual C stocks (r2 = 0.93), and between fruit weight and annual C stocks (r2 = 0.95). Carbon estimates in the mounds of vine biomass fractions wood, root and canes (10.25 Mg C/ha) were not significantly different than for individually measured vines (10.02 Mg C/ha).This research demonstrates that allometric equations represent strong predictive power for C estimations due to high correlations and low error between these simple measurements and C stocks. Such equations, using information collected from vineyard management practices, could enable growers to estimate C stocks more easily and would facilitate managing C at a vineyard level.

This is a necessary and important policy step, given the sector\u2019s substantial contribution to national emissions, rapid production and emissions growth projections. Yet our analysis and modelling suggests that the oil and gas sector has a limited ability to deliver emission intensity improvements between now and 2020. To ensure cost-effective policy and increase the level of ambition for achieving deeper emissions reductions, federal sector-by-sector GHG regulations should consider including compliance flexibility both within and beyond the sector. Federal lightand heavy-duty vehicle GHG regulations, as well as Alberta\u2019s Specified Gas Emitters Regulation (SGER), provide compliance flexibility blueprints from which to inform the emerging federal oil and gas GHG regulations.

Careful design can lead to more cost-effective\u2014and more ambitious\u2014regulations for reducing Canadian GHG emissions. While the lack of federal carbon pricing policy has been much lamented, we are now seeing federal GHG regulations move forward that include the most important element of carbon pricing\u2014flexibility. Both the light-duty vehicle regulations and the proposed heavy-duty vehicle regulations include elements of compliance transfers such as crediting and banking. This movement to hybrid performance regulations with elements of compliance flexibility is positive, as regulators seek to strike a balance between emissions reductions and competitiveness. While the current political reality has moved policy away from the economist\u2019s preferred \u201cfirst best\u201d carbon pricing, the sector-by-sector regulations do seem to be evolving toward increased flexibility, partially tempering the risks from rigid, prescriptive and potentially high-cost policy. Such pragmatic policy design is the focus of this policy brief. Building on the federal GHG sector-by-sector approach to regulating carbon, we explore the implications of developing flexible performance-based regulations for the oil and gas sector. We ask three simple questions to help inform the design of new performance-based regulations: 1. What flexibility mechanisms in existing GHG regulations might inform new oil and gas regulations? 2. How important is compliance flexibility to the oil and gas sector? 3. What flexibility mechanisms can be added to the oil and gas performance regulations to keep costs low while achieving emission reductions? Our approach to addressing these questions builds on IISD\u2019s previous work in the Regulating Carbon Emissions in Canada initiative.3 Specifically, in Mind the Gap (Sawyer, 2011), we identified five principles that should inform the design of performance-based regulations: 1. Establish certainty through a regulatory schedule that makes expected effort clear 2. Enable flexibility while achieving emissions reductions 3. Avoid disproportionate costs across emissions in Canada 4. Seek reductions throughout the entire emission inventory 5. Accommodate a transition to carbon pricing in the longer term These principles still hold, and our recommendations on the design of new federal oil and gas regulations are solidly embedded in this framework. We find that the movement in federal sector-by-sector GHG regulations to include more compliance flexibility is particularly important for the oil and gas sector, with an opportunity both to design costeffective regulations and to increase the level of ambition for achieving deeper emissions reductions. This policy brief focuses mainly on the 2020 time horizon and on emissions reductions that can contribute to Canada\u2019s 2020 target of 17 per cent below 2005 emissions levels. However, we recognize that longer-term emissions reductions also matter for Canada, given the long-lived capital stock now being deployed by the oil and gas sector, and so must 3 See www.iisd.org/climate/north_american/regulating_carbon.aspx B.C.'s GGRTA 0.7 Mt 1% Alberta 3.5 Mt 3% EU ETS 81 Mt 80% NSW GGAS 15 Mt 14% State Power Rule (Oregon) 1.5 Mt 2% POLICY BRIEF OCTOBER 2012 Flexibility and Federal Oil and Gas Greenhouse Gas Regulations: Containing costs while increasing ambition 3 B.C.'s GGRTA 0.7 Mt 1% Alberta 3.5 Mt 3% EU ETS 81 Mt 80% NSW GGAS 15 Mt 14% State Power Rule (Oregon) 1.5 Mt 2% also be considered in policy design. Finally, the oil and gas sector is defined in this report as both conventional and unconventional oil extraction, upgrading, natural gas extraction and petroleum refining. These sectors will likely be regulated under emerging federal oil and gas regulations. Flexibility Mechanisms in Existing GHG Regulations Regulatory policies for mitigating GHG emissions are a key part of Canada\u2019s current climate change policy landscape. The federal government in particular has begun to implement a sector-by-sector approach to GHG regulation. It has announced or enacted regulations in three sectors\u2014light-duty vehicles, coal-fired electricity generation and heavyduty vehicles\u2014and plans to announce regulations for the oil and gas extraction sector by 2013. Alberta has similarly relied on a regulatory framework, having had its SGER for industrial emitters in place since 2007. Yet a brief review of some of the details of each of these regulations illustrates that there isn\u2019t necessarily a clear-cut division between regulatory and market-based policy approaches. Existing regulations are already relying on flexibility mechanisms to contain costs. Federal Light-Duty Vehicle Regulations4 Canada\u2019s light-duty vehicle regulations require that for each model year 2011 and forward, the average GHG emissions from a given automobile manufacturer\u2019s fleet of new passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks meet\u2014on average\u2014a given standard for emissions per mile travelled. The regulatory standard does, however, include a number of flexibility mechanisms, because a company can obtain credits if its fleet\u2019s average emissions are lower than the regulated threshold. These credits can be used within the next five years of compliance with the regulation. Essentially, this is a banking mechanism. Manufacturers can choose to improve vehicle efficiency earlier, rather than later, if it is more cost-effective for them to do so. Companies can also transfer credits to other manufacturers. This trading mechanism allows the manufacturers that can most cost-effectively improve efficiency to do so, and those less equipped to purchase additional credits. Both of these flexibility mechanisms serve to decrease the total cost of compliance for the regulation, without affecting its impact on emissions reductions. These mechanisms align with our second and third principles for regulation. Banking allows flexibility across time, and trading allows flexibility across the regulated emissions, allowing firms to seek out the lowest cost options for emissions reductions. Federal Heavy-Duty Vehicle Regulations5 The proposed regulations for emissions from heavy-duty vehicles require progressively more stringent GHG emission standards for new on-road heavy-duty vehicles and engines for model years starting in 2014. The regulations apply to companies manufacturing and importing new on-road heavy-duty vehicles and engines for the purpose of sale in Canada. However, this proposed regulation also lays out a credit system. Similar to the light-duty vehicle regulations, manufacturers with vehicle fleets that fall below the required average level of emissions can obtain credits. These credits can be banked (used for compliance with subsequent model-year standards) or traded (sold to other manufacturers for 4 Information for this section is drawn from Government of Canada (2010). 5 Information for this section is drawn from Department of the Environment (2012).

However, the time course of carbon release from CWD is not well understood. We compiled CWD decomposition rate-constants (i.e., k ) to examine how tree species, piece diameter, position (i.e., standing versus downed), canopy openness, and macroclimate influenced k . To illustrate their implications we modeled the effect of species and position on estimates of decomposition-related carbon flux. We examined a subset of currently used models to determine if their structure accounted for these factors. Results Globally k of downed CWD varied at least 244-fold with interspecies variation at individual sites up to 76-fold. While k generally decreased with increasing piece diameter, under open canopies the opposite occurred. Standing CWD sometimes exhibited little decomposition, but sometimes had k values up to 3 times faster than downed CWD. There was a clear response of k to mean annual temperature of\u2009\u2248\u20092.6 times per 10\u00a0\u2103; however, there was considerable variation for a given mean annual temperature related to species, diameter, and position. A key feature of carbon release from CWD after disturbance was the \u201cevolution\u201d of the ecosystem-level k value as positions and species mixtures of the remaining CWD changed. Variations in decomposition caused by disturbance (e.g., changes in species, positions, sizes, and microclimate) had the potential to cause net carbon fluxes to the atmosphere to be highly nonlinear. While several models currently being used for carbon accounting and assessing land-use/climate change would potentially capture some of these post disturbance changes in fluxes and carbon balances, many would not. Conclusions While much has been learned in the last 5 decades about CWD decomposition, to fully understand the time course of carbon release from increased mortality and other aspects of global change a new phase of global CWD research that is more systematic, experimental, and replicated needs to be initiated. If our findings are to be fully applied in modeling, an approach acknowledging how the rate of carbon release evolves over time should be implemented.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "d411e988a70d6e808990d08c199cbb4c09e70851", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3366380", "CorpusId": 201851636}, "title": "Highly Flexible Zero-Carbon Electricity Generation Using an Innovative Oxy-Fired Supercritical CO2 Power Cycle", "abstract": "Along with renewables and nuclear power, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is expected to play a vital role in decarbonising electricity production. In future electricity systems, CCS power plants will be required to respond to the fluctuating supply of renewable energy by varying their output and through rapid shut-downs and start-ups [1]. This concept of flexible operation initially proposed by academics at the University of Edinburgh [1, 2] allows CCS plants to time-delay the financial and energy output penalty of carbon capture processes. Whilst the concept was developed for conventional fossil fuel power cycles with post-combustion capture, this project is the first to apply it to the Allam Cycle, a recent breakthrough in low-carbon energy generation. The Allam Cycle is an oxy-fired supercritical CO2 power cycle, currently undergoing pilot scale testing as part of a $140m scheme led by NET Power [3]. It is designed to produce zero carbon electricity at competitive efficiency and costs compared to unabated fossil fuel plants, thus exhibiting a step-change in performance compared to state of the art CCS power generation. In the Allam Cycle, shown in Figure 1, an Air Separation Unit produces oxygen which is combusted with natural gas, producing a high-pressure working fluid above 90% supercritical CO2 in volume, which is then used to drive an electricity generating turbine. Most of this CO2 is then compressed and fed back into the cycle, while surplus is removed at the required pressure and quality for pipeline transport. Thus, the cycle inherently captures all CO2 produced, without the expense of an add-on capture system. The potential for enhanced operational flexibility in the Allam Cycle arises from the opportunity to decouple the highly energy intensive step of oxygen production from power generation.

The X field is a high pressure high temperature (HPHT) carbonate reservoir with a temperature of 423 K and pressure of 36.0 MPa with about 500 m of gas column. It was chosen as a candidate due to its well and reservoir data completeness. The plan is technically challenging as it involves re-injecting produced supercritical CO2 back into an aquifer reservoir for permanent storage. Recently acquired X field DST data indicates the presence of CO2 in the aquifer, up to a level nearing saturation. Information of the initial CO2 concentration level in the aquifer reservoir is critical to ensure the success of the CO2 injection. Predictions on this initial CO2 solubility have been made using available well data, however the reliability of the results has to be validated by an experimental study. Therefore, an extensive experimental approach to measure initial CO2 solubility in the X field aquifer reservoir has been conducted. As pressure, temperature and salinity are the important key parameters that influence CO2 solubility, detailed information about X field gas and aquifer brine compositions are well determined prior to the solubility measurement. Utilizing lab facilities at Heriot-Watt University (HWU), measurements were conducted at T=423.15 K and pressure at 36.0 MPa to mimic the X field aquifer conditions. The experimental results obtained are compared against available literature data, Duan Model and sCPA-EoS model and reasonable agreements were observed. Experimental results indicated that the X field aquifer is not fully saturated with CO2 and it could accommodate an additional 6 mol% of CO2 dissolved in the brine. In addition, approximately 6 mol% of hydrocarbon will be recovered from the same aquifer system as a result of CO2 injection due to the CO2-Hydrocarbon displacement.

INTRODUCTION CO2 has a long tradition in modern industrial processes and furthermore plays an increasing role in the present discussion of the world wide climate change. It is used in refinery, chemical and food industry applications as well as for fire extinguishers or as a solvent. Today many industrial processes require CO2 not in a gaseous but in a compressed state at a specific pressure and temperature. The traditional approach for compressing CO2 is by using high-speed reciprocating compressors. Nevertheless this technology is limited in several ways \u2013 e.g. the flow capacity has strong restrictions due to the mechanical design. For this reason centrifugal type compressor systems are now state of the art and a promising solution for future CO2 projects. Centrifugal compressors generally can be split into two major types which are distinguished by their design namely single-shaft (inline, between bearings) centrifugals and multishaft integrally geared centrifugals. This paper will focus mainly on integrally geared centrifugal compressors. MAN Diesel & Turbo has manufactured reciprocating compressors in the past and still is manufacturing both types of centrifugal technologies (inline and integrally geared type, according to API 617 as stated by MACEYKA, PICKEREL (2007)) for CO2-services. We therefore feel confident and in a position to give a comprehensive overview and comparison of all technologies.

In this study, we evaluated C stocks and woody plant diversity across vineyard blocks and adjoining woodland ecosystems (wildlands) for an organic vineyard in northern California. Carbon was measured in soil from 44 one m deep pits, and in aboveground woody biomass from 93 vegetation plots. These data were combined with physical landscape variables to model C stocks using a geographic information system and multivariate linear regression.ResultsField data showed wildlands to be heterogeneous in both C stocks and woody tree diversity, reflecting the mosaic of several different vegetation types, and storing on average 36.8 Mg C/ha in aboveground woody biomass and 89.3 Mg C/ha in soil. Not surprisingly, vineyard blocks showed less variation in above- and belowground C, with an average of 3.0 and 84.1 Mg C/ha, respectively.ConclusionsThis research demonstrates that vineyards managed with practices that conserve some fraction of adjoining wildlands yield benefits for increasing overall C stocks and species and habitat diversity in integrated agricultural landscapes. For such complex landscapes, high resolution spatial modeling is challenging and requires accurate characterization of the landscape by vegetation type, physical structure, sufficient sampling, and allometric equations that relate tree species to each landscape. Geographic information systems and remote sensing techniques are useful for integrating the above variables into an analysis platform to estimate C stocks in these working landscapes, thereby helping land managers qualify for greenhouse gas mitigation credits.

This research further validates a workflow to quantify CO2 storage resources in the context of the CO2 Storage Resources Management System (SRMS, developed by the Society of Petroleum Engineers), as well as an assessment of the impact of the current carbon tax credit program ( 45Q), applied directly to the storage resources results for the High Island Field 1 0L using a simple NPV approach based on cash flows.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "47823c4090090b276b31996e7c34f15c470b573e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "614103377", "CorpusId": 102335278}, "title": "Assessing the risks of deep injection of treated wastewater into an aquifer for storage and reclamation", "abstract": "Characterising behaviour of a particular liquid material injected into an aquifer is fraught with uncertainties and unknowns due to a multiplicity of factors. These include the sub-surface environment, the quality of the material to be injected, its behaviour during and after injection. Knowledge is required not only of the geological and chemical characteristics of the aquifer such as the profile of any existing native liquid material, but of the natural ecology of the soil into which product is to be injected and specific details of the composition of the liquid. Neither the soil nor the product for injection should be assumed to be inert or sterile. Some relationships between geological, chemical and microbiological constituents will occur if only though dint of close contact and the nature of these interactions needs understanding if, as in the instance of artificial injection, a change in existing natural conditions is involved. Storage and reuse of wastewater for the growing metropolis of Sydney has been suggested as a way of capturing and reusing wastewater currently being disposed through ocean outfalls. The present paper examines some of the concerns in the deep injection of treated wastewater for reclamation-reuse purposes. This technology, termed aquifer storage and recovery (ASR) has already been tested in a 5year experiment at the Andrews Farm site on the North Adelaide Plains of South Australia (Barry et al, 2002). The current paper in particular, focuses on three aspects of using ASR for water conservation purposes in the Sydney region. The approach is: (i) an overview of geological data on Sydney region comparing two hypothetical sites the Bald Hill Claystone and the Botany Sands aquifer (ii) attention to issues of a hydrogeochemical and microbiological nature that could impact on groundwater in an aquifer if deep injection of wastewater is undertaken; and (iii) foreshadowing methods which could be used to learn more about microbial populations and behaviour in the aquifer after injection of treated wastewater. Aquifer Sites in the Sydney Basin There has been interest in ASR for some years in government circles, at the Department of Sustainable Natural Resources, formerly the Department of Land and Water Conservation (DLWC) and Sydney Water. There has already been debate among academics about using ASR techniques for water conservation and recycling to service an increasing demand for water by the rapidly expanding urban metropolis of Sydney and the associated regions. Such initiatives have been successfully adopted in USA and more recently in Singapore for reuse projects. In an attempt to lay the foundation to advance such a Project, researchers at the National Center for Groundwater Management at University of Technology, Sydney examined the suitability of the Sydney Metropolitan Area in the Sydney Geological Basin for receipt and storage. Pawelczyk (2002) provided an extensive and thorough examination of the geology and hydrology of the southern portion within these boundaries. Using criteria identified by previous researchers (Corkery, 1978), Pawelczyk was able to reject a number of recognized stratigraphic sectors within the Sydney Basin (see Figure 1) as being unsuitable for deep injection and storage of water. A variety of reasons were given ranging from the nature of the sediment, to closeness to known coal resources, to tendency towards grain suturing and/or quartz and clay cementation which would eliminate virtually all primary porosity, a necessary requirement for ASR (pawelczyk, 2002). Nevertheless, Pawelczyk identified two regions, Botany and Campbelltown which contained hydrogeologically suitable formations. The former contains the Botany Sands Aquifer while the latter includes the Bald Hill Claystone. The properties of the Botany Sands Aquifer are much better known than those of the Bald Hill Claystone. From the available data, Pawelcyzk concluded that it should be possible to exploit a portion of the 18300 hectare Botany Sands aquifer (total capacity approximately 170,000ML) for artificial aquifer storage and recovery (ASR). This suggestion however, was not without its problems. Botany Basin Sands vs Bald Hill Claystone Three host lithologies for groundwater resources are evident in map notes accompanying the Hawkesbury-Nepean Catchment Groundwater Availability Map (Krumins, Bradd and McKribbin, 1998). Unconsolidated sediments, porous rocks and fractured rocks predominate. Of these, unconsolidated sediments and porous rocks sedimentary rocks of sandstone, sandy shale and shale which are inherently porous in nature yield low salinity groundwater at varying levels but with low yields. The Botany Sands aquifer favoured by Pawelczyk covers an area in the northern part of the Botany Basin. This area is constituted of unconsolidated sands, clays and peats. It is an unconfmed aquifer and, according to DLWC (2000), the aquifer is currently the only significant source of groundwater within 45 kilometres of Sydney. Existing data indicates that Bald Hill claystone and siltstone, predominantly composed of kaolinite (approx 75%) are the main geological features with quartz, haematite, siderite and goethite present in lesser proportions. Unlike the Botany area, the aquifer here is overlaid and confmed potentially making it easier to conduct a focused study on the behaviour of groundwater over time and the impact of injected material. Further: The Botany area is well settled with houses, units and some high rise residential occupying approximately 74% available above-ground area. An additional 12% is assigned to industry including industrial and agricultural chemical manufactures and petroleum related business. In the past, the industry and manufacturing businesses were inclined to draw substantial amounts of groundwater from the Botany Sands aquifer beneath resulting in fluctuations in water table particularly with increased surface inflow during prolonged wet weather. These fluctuations in the water table have been monitored via a series of groundwater monitoring wells in the northern, southern and western regions of the Basin (Fish et aI, 2000). As people have displaced industry in the Botany area over the past few years, industrial draw down of the underlying groundwater has been reduced considerably and the water balance in the aquifer beneath has stabilized. Conditions in the Sub-Surface Conditions in an aquifer and the general environment deep in the sub-surface would affect the wastewater, organisms still present in it and any other suspended material. They, in tum will impact existing sub-surface conditions and biota. Changes that would be anticipated depend on: (i) Oxygen levels in the aquifer. Different species of microbes survive and reproduce under aerobic, anoxic and anaerobic conditions in an aquifer. And the deeper the aquifer, the lower the percentage of oxygen available for life. (ii) A carbon or organic carbon sources introduced as suspended or colloidal material with wastewater which can act as a food source for anaerobes as well as aerobes. Existing species in the aquifer which mayor may not have been active prior to the introduction of wastewater may begin to reproduce and multiply. (iii) Temperature. While latitude of a site and geology are important, temperature in the soil, like oxygen, falls with depth from the surface. The presence of water can affect temperature as the water in soil can freeze thereby restricting movement and life. (iv) The existence of pores, cracks and fractures between soil particles can provide tiny pockets for air and water as well as a niche habitat for microbes as earlier discussed. (v) pH. Wastewater tends to have a higher pH than rain water (pH around 4.3) and other infiltrates which may percolate through the soil to reach the native groundwater. (vi) Research undertaken by Lovley and Goodwin (1988) and others suggest that there are discrete zones in the soil sub-surface where survival of a population is dependent as much on the availability of minerals in the soil, including pollutant residues and their chemistry Activity after Injection Conditions in the sub-surface and at the groundwater table, after injection of wastewater into a confined aquifer will show the impact of the injected liquor after a reasonably short period of time after allowing for mixing and settlement. Using data from a typical wastewater treatment plant in the Sydney area (Table 1 Malabar STP), it could reasonably be presumed that coliform, enterococci and other species present in the discharge will face different and challenging conditions in the cold, low oxygen environment of a deep aquifer. Unless break-point chlorination is practised and this is not the case at Malabar STP it could reasonably be presumed that many of these and other species would be present in the discharge effluent which would be injected into the aquifer. Competition for nutrients and carbon substrates between species such that one becomes dominant would distort the chemical and microbial balance achieved under normal pre-injection conditions. Changes of this nature would impact on water quality, potential for re-draw for reuse and possibly also technical issues associated with re-draw processes. Just to detail some of the other issues: {a) Sorption Studies on Aquifer Sediments Sorption between a dissolved and particulate phase in aquifer systems is important for a wide range of organics, inorganics and metals. In the literature, organic carbon is recognized as the principal sorbent compartment for hydrophobic organic chemicals in aquatic systems. The partitioning potential of a chemical is characterized by its organic carbon partition coefficient. Mineral surfaces contain oxide functional groups that give the surface a pH-dependent charge and that can be involved in electrostatic and ligand-exchange reactions. The mineral surfaces may contain pores of varying sizes.

This may have impacts on the different stages of the CCS chain: capture, transportation, compression, injection and storage [1]. For a global account of these impacts and for a precise specification of maximal amounts of contaminants that can be tolerated in CO2 flues, further investigations are strongly required. Accurate knowledge of the phase equilibrium (Vapor-Liquid equilibrium: VLE) of contaminant-contaminant is part of the required studies in order to assess this problem. In this communication, we have chosen to present VLE of two binary mixtures: SO2/O2 and SO2/N2.
