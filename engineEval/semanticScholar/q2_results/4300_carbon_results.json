A rapid expansion of renewables in the Chilean energy matrix, mostly thanks to exceptional solar and wind resources, combined with a rapid decrease in the cost of renewable energy technologies, intensified current policy debates to reduce the role of coal, which is the largest source of CO2 emissions in the generation mix. Recently, the main generation companies in Chile made a voluntary commitment to not invest in new coal projects that do not include carbon capture and storage systems. In addition, the Chilean government announced its plans to phase out coal plants completely by 2040. In this context, the aim of this research is to study the economy-wide and emission reduction impacts of different decarbonization paths in the Chilean power sector.

Several options of carbon sequestration being considered are geologic, oceanic, chemical transformations and terrestrial. Among these the transfer of atmospheric CO2 into biotic and pedologic carbon pools is called terrestrial carbon sequestration. It is a natural process with ancillary benefits besides cost-effectiveness. Plants fix atmospheric CO2 through photosynthesis and convert them as bio mass by storing them in various organs. Plantation crops are perennials that are grown in large scale and are mostly found in mixed species cropping systems. Such cropping systems offer a large amount of bio mass production per unit area than mono cropping system. Hence, they act as carbon pools and help in reducing the effect of global warming. Cocoa is an excellent crop in sequestering atmospheric carbon (35 t/ha by 15 year old plantation) and storing in various plant parts as well as in soil aggregates. Carbon capture and storage decreases with increase in plant density. The sequestration potential of tea varies between clones and seedlings as well as age. It increases with age. Seedlings have potential of capturing more carbon than clones. The carbon content of the foliage and roots of seedlings was higher than of clonal plants. The amount of carbon that rubber plantations sequester ranges from 135 to 153 t /ha out of which 39 \u2013 69% is contributed by soil organic carbon pool. The bulk density of soil in top 15 cm was low when compared to 15-30 cm depth of soil and the Bulk density decreased with age. The total carbon sequestrated was higher in the top 0-15 cm soil layer and lower in 15-30 cm. Estimates of C in upper 40 cm of soil in mature plantations of coffee showed soil stock of 97.27and 95.78 Mg/C/ ha in shaded and open grown coffee systems. Plantation crops are perennials with large biomass production, and act as \u2018natural Sponges\u2019 for absorbing CO2 from atmosphere. Mostly grown in mixed cropping system, these crops form an excellent species in sequestering atmospheric carbon besides providing nutritional security and restoring soil fertility.

Upon reviewing the four scenarios, it is clear that the Rotterdam Nucleus (referred to as the 'Pilot Case') is the leading scenario and as a result it is explored in more detail. The potential Pilot Case is based on the development of Rotterdam (in the Netherlands) as a southern North Sea hub. Under this Rotterdam Nucleus scenario, captured CO2 will be transported through the Port of Rotterdam to depleted gas fields offshore the Netherlands. CO2 will also be transported through further links using CCS infrastructure to facilitate the processing of undeveloped gas fields offshore UK. The Pilot case contemplates further expansion opportunities, increasing the capture clusters through additional pipelines, expanding to further gas fields and using the port of Rotterdam for CO2 shipping-hence the analysis of the other scenarios may be invaluable in the future development of CO2 networks in the EU.

Current estimates suggest that the sequestration resource of the state is large, and could safely and effectively accept all of the emissions from large CO2 point sources for many decades and store them indefinitely. This process requires suitable sites to sequester large volumes of CO2 for long periods of time. Site characterization is the first step in this process, and the state will ultimately face regulatory, legal, and technical questions as commercial CCS projects develop and commence operations. The most important aspects of site characterizations are injectivity, capacity, and effectiveness. A site can accept at a high rate a large volume of CO2 and store it for a long time is likely to serve as a good site for geological carbon sequestration. At present, there are many conventional technologies and approaches that can be used to estimate, quantify, calculate, and assess the viability of a sequestration site. Any regulatory framework would need to rely on conventional, easily executed, repeatable methods to inform the site selection and permitting process. The most important targets for long-termmore\u00a0\u00bb storage are deep saline formations and depleted oil and gas fields. The primary CO2 storage mechanisms for these targets are well understood enough to plan operations and simulate injection and long-term fate of CO2. There is also a strong understanding of potential geological and engineering hazards for CCS. These hazards are potential pathway to CO2 leakage, which could conceivably result in negative consequences to health and the environmental. The risks of these effects are difficult to quantify; however, the hazards themselves are sufficiently well understood to identify, delineate, and manage those risks effectively. The primary hazard elements are wells and faults, but may include other concerns as well. There is less clarity regarding the legal and regulatory issues around site characterization for large CCS injection volumes. In particular, it is not clear what would constitute due diligence for a potential selection and operation of a commercial site. This is complicated by a lack of clarity around permitting issues and subsurface ownership. However, there are many natural, industrial, regulatory, and legal analogs for these questions. However, solutions will need to evolve within the set of laws and practices current to the State. The chief conclusion of this chapter is that there is enough knowledge today to characterize a site for geological carbon sequestration safely and effective permitting and operation.

Many of these issues can be mitigated by introducing energy storage technologies. These technologies facilitate load following and can effectively time-shift power. This analysis compares dedicated and synergistic energy storage technologies using energy efficiency as the primary metric. Energy storage will help renewable sources come to the grid, but fossil fuels still dominate energy sources for decades to come in nearly all projections.

Brown coal has a higher moisture content than black coal and generates more CO 2 emissions per unit of useful energy when combusted. Consequently, while the Latrobe Valley's power stations provide Australia's lowest-cost bulk electricity, they are also responsible for over 60 million tonnes of CO 2 emissions per year-over half of the Victorian total. In an increasingly carbon constrained world the ongoing development of the Latrobe Valley brown coal resource is likely to require a drastic reduction in the CO 2 emissions from new coal use projects-and carbon capture and storage (CCS) has the potential to meet such deep cuts. The offshore Gippsland Basin, the site of major producing oil and gas fields, has the essential geological characteristics to provide a high-volume, low-cost site for CCS. The importance of this potential to assist the continuing use of the nation's lowest-cost energy source prompted the Australian Government to fund the Latrobe Valley CO 2 Storage Assessment (LVCSA). The LVCSA proposal was initiated by Monash Energy (formerly APEL, and now a 100% subsidiary of Anglo American)-the proponent of a major brown coal-to-liquids plant in the Latrobe Valley. Monash Energy's plans for the 60,000 BBL per day plant include CCS to store about 13 million tonnes of CO 2 per year. The LVCSA, undertaken for Monash Energy by the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC), provides a medium to high-level technical and economic characterisation of the volume and cost potential for secure geosequestration of CO 2 produced by the use of Latrobe Valley brown coal (Hooper et al, 2005a). The assessment's scope includes consideration of the interaction between CO 2 injection and oil and gas production, and its findings have been publicly released for use by CCS proponents, oil and gas producers and all other interested parties as an executive summary, (Hooper et al, 2005b), a fact sheet (Hooper et al, 2005c) and a presentation (Hooper et al, 2005d)). The LVCSA identifies the key issues and challenges for implementing CCS in the Latrobe Valley and provides a reference framework for the engagement of stakeholders. In effect the LVCSA constitutes a pre-feasibility study for the implementation of geosequestration in support of the continuing development of Victoria's brown coal resources. The LVCSA findings indicate that the Gippsland Basin has sufficient capacity to safely and securely store large volumes of CO 2 and may provide a viable means of substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants and other projects using brown coal in the Latrobe Valley. The assessment also indicates that CO 2 injection could well be designed to avoid any adverse impact on adjacent oil and gas production, so that CO 2 injection can begin near fields that have not yet come to the end of their productive lives. However, CCS proposals involving adjacent injection and production will require more detailed risk management strategies and continuing cooperation between prospective injectors and existing producers.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "e386121c8121aac561a39bc824699d3492b70b7c", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 202706049}, "title": "Chapter 2 Post-combustion Carbon Capture , Storage , and Utilization", "abstract": "Deployment of carbon capture, storage, and utilization technologies worldwide from the CO2 emission point source is a strategy that has been proposed to address the challenge of climate change and global warming.

This chapter provides an overview of various types of carbon capture, storage, and utilization technologies. After that, one of the carbon capture and utilization technologies, i.e., microalgae pond systems, is illustrated in detail. The principles of microalgae open pond systems, key parameters affecting productivity, and economic considerations of operating open ponds are systematically illustrated. 2.1 Significance and Importance Human activities resulted in emissions of four long-lived greenhouse gases (GHGs): CO2, CH4, N2O, and halocarbons, of which CO2 is the most important anthropogenic GHG due to its solitary responsibility for about two-thirds of the enhanced greenhouse effect [1]. Meanwhile, rapid economic growth in developing countries such as China and India is driving worldwide energy demand and usage day by day. At the same time, it has been predicted that fossil fuels will remain the dominant energy source around the world for at least another 20 years to fulfill such energy demands [2]. As CO2 keeps accumulating in the atmosphere after generating from power plant, concerns about serious and irreversible damage, such as rising water level and species extinction, are being raised regarding its influence on climate change. Consequently, it is clear that effective control of CO2 emissions is required to achieve the goal of global CO2 concentration below 550 ppm over next the 100 years [3]. \u00a9 Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2017 P.-C. Chiang and S.-Y. Pan, Carbon Dioxide Mineralization and Utilization, DOI 10.1007/978-981-10-3268-4_2 9 2.1.1 Strategies on Global CO2 Mitigation It is noted that the increased global average CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is likely to cause further warming and induce many changes in the global climate system. To reduce CO2 in the atmosphere, five strategies can be considerable [4]: \u2022 Strategy 1: Reducing the amount of CO2 producer sources (reducing energy intensity) \u2022 Strategy 2: Using CO2 (or reducing carbon intensity) \u2022 Strategy 3: Capturing and storing of CO2 \u2022 Strategy 4: Switching to less carbon-intensive fuels from conventional fuels \u2022 Strategy 5: Increasing the use of renewable energies. The third strategy involves the development of innovative, available, and cost-effective carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies because of a 50-year estimate for the continued widespread burning of fossil fuels, the goal of reaching a 500 ppm atmospheric CO2 concentration plateau, and the lag time needed for the development and implementation of new carbonless sources of energy [4, 5]. In general, the carbon capture technologies can be classified into three categories: \u2022 Precombustion capture \u2022 Post-combustion capture \u2022 Oxy-fuel combustion 2.1.2 Transition from Storage to Utilization As a viable option for reducing CO2 emissions, moving CCS technology to incorporate \u201cutilization\u201d [i.e., carbon capture and utilization (CCU)] has received dramatically global attention. Europe (in particular Germany), the USA, and Australia are well advanced in research and development of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies [6, 7]. The utilization routes of the captured CO2 include enhanced fuel recovery (i.e., enhanced oil recovery and enhanced gas recovery), biological conversion (i.e., algae), food industry, chemicals (i.e., fertilizer and liquid fuel), refrigerant, inerting agents, fire suppression, plastics, and even mineralization as carbonates (i.e., precipitated calcium carbonates (PCC) and construction materials). The benefits of CCU technologies include the following: [6, 8]. \u2022 Potentially reduce annual CO2 emissions by at least 3.7 Gt, equivalent to about 10% of the world\u2019s current annual emissions \u2022 Value-added products that create green jobs and economic benefits and help offset the abatement cost. 10 2 Post-combustion Carbon Capture, Storage, and Utilization", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "9f580872ffd3b2aefe1f87a64abf42c448a6576c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2587370943", "DOI": "10.1163/15718085-12341419", "CorpusId": 157774276}, "title": "The uk Liability Framework for the Transport of CO2 for Offshore Carbon Capture and Storage Operations", "abstract": "Carbon (dioxide) capture and storage (CCS) is one of the solutions for decarbonising society whereby CO2 is captured, transported, and injected into geological formations.

Since Siemens has developed, tested and piloted a proprietary postcombustion CO2 capture technology (PostCap) for the removal of CO2 from the flue gas of coal and gas fired power plants suitable for the project, both parties decided to cooperate in executing a FEED study. The solvent Siemens based its technology on is an aqueous amino acid salt solution. Siemens and Masdar have completed a FEED study for capturing 1,800,000 tons of CO2 annually from a natural gas fired power plant in Abu Dhabi, by application of the PostCap technology. Various opportunities and challenges were encountered during the design of the retrofit capture plant. Challenges were often specific to the region, including local climate, water availability and flue gas quality. Design and optimisation of the plant was influenced by local energy and labour prices. Further opportunities included integration with the power plant and a local industrial facility. The power plant had to supply the capture plant with steam and power without reducing the original electricity production capacity. In order to accomplish this, several heat and power integration concepts were evaluated with respect to their feasibility, including the application of a back-pressure steam turbine and the retrofit of a simple cycle gas turbine to combined cycle. Various cooling options were considered, in view of climate and resource challenges. Cooling water had to be extracted from a reflux stream produced by an adjacent industrial facility. Drawing on the results of the FEED study this paper presents how the Siemens PostCap technology can be applied for capturing CO2 at a power plant in Abu Dhabi for the purpose of EOR while satisfying specific local needs, and how simultaneously utility supply and power plant integration can be facilitated.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "64a3966020f990655b60149f78e34d4524dec8cb", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 218570253}, "title": "Pouring Out Our Soils: Facing the Challenge of Poorly Defined Property Rights in Subsurface Pore Space for Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "As the United States strives to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and particularly carbon dioxide (\u201cCO2\u201d) emissions from the generation of electricity, one of the promising technological options is carbon capture and storage (\u201cCCS\u201d), a practice that involves injecting large volumes (millions of tons) of CO2 deep underground for what is essentially permanent storage.1 However, as is often the case with new practices and technologies, the interest in CCS has raised a number of regulatory and legal issues, including that of property ownership of deep-subsurface pore space that would hold the compressed gas.

The latter are caused by land use conversion that began with the dawn of settled agriculture several millennia ago, and by fossil fuel combustion that began with the onset of the industrial revolution in about 1750. Emissions from land use conversion during the pre-industrial era until about 1850 are estimated at ~320 Pg. Since 1850, emissions from fossil fuel combustion are estimated at ~350 Pg and those from land use conversion at ~150 Pg. These and other anthropogenic activities have caused drastic perturbation of the global carbon cycle with increase in the atmospheric C pool and an attendant decrease in the pedologic, biotic, and geologic (fossil fuel) pools. Together, the pedologic pool (4,000 Pg to 3 m depth) and the biotic pool (620 Pg), called the terrestrial pool, is the third largest pool, after the oceanic (38,000 Pg) and the geologic (~5,000 Pg). The depletion of the terrestrial C pool has created a C sink capacity which can be filled by conversion to a restorative land use and adoption of recommended soil, plant, and animal management practices. The process of transfer of atmospheric CO2 into the pedologic and biotic pools is called carbon sequestration. This natural process contrasts with that of the geoengineering techniques of carbon capture and storage (CCS) involving geologic and oceanic storage and mineral carbonation of CO2 into calcite etc. The strategy of biosequestration, in addition to being cost-effective, has numerous ancillary benefits. It is a truly win\u2013win option. Specifically, it improves soil quality, enhances agronomic productivity, and advances food security. Improvement in soil quality by C sequestration is related to generation and stabilization of micro-aggregates created through formation of organo-mineral complexes. The strategies of biosequestration involve development of a positive ecosystems C budget in soil by mulch farming, conservation agriculture, no-till systems, integrated nutrient management including biological N fixation and mycorrhizae use of amendments including biochar, and adoption of complex farming systems such as agroforestry.

When the diameter of glass beads is the same, distribution of volume of trapped bubbles is similar for each condition. At the pressure of 8.5MPa and the temperature of 45oC, which corresponds to just above a critical point, the morphology of the interface between the supercritical CO2 and water suggests that CO2 is non-wetting to glass beads.

Integrated configurations of power-to-gas and carbon capture by means of renewable energy surplus", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide is the largest single contributor to global warming [1] and current atmospheric concentrations are increasing at the fastest ever observed rate (2.0 ppm/yr) [2]. To reverse this situation, the International Energy Agency (IEA) stated as top priority the decarbonization of electricity and heat generation sectors, because they produce more than two-fifths of global CO2 emissions [3].\nIn Europe, the decarbonization of the energy system is based on largely deploying renewable energy sources (RES) [4]. This deployment has already allow to reduce CO2 emissions a 12% with respect to 2009 levels [5]. However, moving forward in this direction implies high shares of intermittent sources in energy production that might cause temporary electricity surpluses, and make the system operation more complex [6][7]. Hence, the objective of the first part of the thesis is to quantify the potential energy surplus that might exist in the future Spanish energy mix due to the renewable penetration. This study was published in Energy, and presented in the 13th International Conference on Greenhouse Gas Control Technologies with an associated paper in Energy Procedia:\ni Energy storage in Spain: forecasting electricity excess and assessment of Power-to-Gas potential up to 2050, Energy 2018, 143, 900-910\nii Power to Gas technology under Spanish future energy scenario, Energy Procedia 2017, 114, 6880-6885\nFacing this situation, the European Commission proposed the development of large scale energy storage as a solution [8]. Energy storage can balance renewable electricity surplus from low to high demand periods, as well as displace fossil fuels in applications that traditionally were hardly covered by renewable energies (e.g., transport). Nevertheless, current energy storage technologies are hindered at large scale either by practical (e.g., special locations required, potential hazards) or technical constrains (e.g., low rate power, short storage durations) [9][10][11]. The most promising technique to overcome these limitations is the hydrogen energy storage. It uses electricity to feed electrolyzers that dissociate water and produce hydrogen (energy carrier), which can be later used to re-generate electricity [12]. Still, two main barriers must be overcome to make hydrogen storage feasible: the high cost (investments above 1000 \u20ac/kW, and lack of distribution infrastructure) and the low round-trip efficiency (36.5% - 66.5%, LHV) [13]. \nTo that end, a new concept known as Power to Gas (PtG) has stood out in the last years [14]. Power to Gas combines the H2 from electrolysis with CO2 to produce CH4 (main component of natural gas), thus transferring the electricity surplus from the electric network to the gas infrastructure [15]. This synthetic natural gas widens the final uses of the stored energy, potentially enabling greater reconversion efficiencies and economic profits. Besides, safety measures and transport costs associated to hydrogen are avoided. So, the second part of this thesis reviews worldwide existing PtG projects. The objective is to gather practical experiences regarding the construction and operation of Power to Gas plants, in order to evaluate the remaining challenges facing industrial development. The review was published in Renewable & Sustainable Energy Reviews:\niii Power to Gas projects review: Lab, pilot and demo plants for storing renewable energy and CO2, Renew Sust Energ Rev 2017, 69, 292-312\nTo date, 46 experimental PtG projects have been developed worldwide, but the high cost of the equipment and the low efficiency still restrict the profitability of the concept, and so do the number of field experiences at industrial scale. The motivation of the thesis is to overcome these barriers. Otherwise, PtG deployment will be restricted until future favorable energy scenarios become a reality (those in which renewable sources predominate and economic penalizations on CO2 emissions strongly apply). The hybridizing potential of Power to Gas [15] (heat from methanation and oxygen from electrolysis) is the key that allows to broaden the suitable scenarios for industrial development.\nThus, the core objective is to propose novel PtG hybrid concepts to rise efficiency, make a better use of the available resources, remove part of the initially required equipment, and widen the potential uses of this technology. The thesis analyses and characterizes the proposed systems to show that significant improvements in PtG systems can be achieved by means of proper hybridizations.\nSome remarkable hybridizations to enhance PtG are those that avoid carbon capture energy penalties, since these are significant when CO2 has to be captured from diluted sources. The efficiency drops between 9 and 12 points [16][17], what hides the positive aspect of CO2 recycling in PtG, and its environmental advantages with respect to the other energy storage technologies (CO2 recycling puts carbon dioxide emissions in a closed loop to continuously regenerate the fuel that is consumed).\nA suitable option to avoid the carbon capture penalty is the hybridization with an oxy-fuel combustion facility. In oxy-fuel combustion, pure oxygen is used as comburent instead of air [18]. The large N2 content present in conventional air-fired combustion is substituted by the combustion products (CO2 and H2O), so flue gas achieves high concentrations of carbon dioxide. Energy penalty associated to this capture process mainly comes from the air separation unit (ASU) that produces the required oxygen (typically 190 kWh/tO2) [19]. Hence, Power to Gas-oxyfuel combustion systems use the oxygen from electrolysis to suppress the electrical consumption demanded by the ASU. Besides, since CO2 is recycled to fuel, the energy consumption of compression stage required to store carbon dioxide is avoided as well.\nWhen this concept is implemented into an application that includes a single boiler, the exothermal heat from methanation can be directly integrated as a useful output of the system. In the case that the concept is used in a power plant, the heat can be integrated in the thermal power cycle to increase the overall electrical efficiency.\nThe PtG-Oxycombustion hybridization is the first proposal studied in this thesis. The ratio between the sizes of electrolysis and oxy-fuel combustion processes is used as a key parameter to define the operation strategy of the hybridization. Besides, different simulations are run to determine the influence of the type of fuel fed to oxy-fuel combustion. Then, the study of the proposal is completed with an application case that comprises the energy integration and efficiency evaluation of a hybrid PtG-oxy-fuel combined cycle power plant. The results were published in three papers:\niv Power to gas-oxyfuel boiler hybrid systems, Int. J. Hydrogen Energy 2015, 24, 168-175\nv Power to Gas-biomass oxycombustion hybrid system: Energy integration and potential applications, Appl Energy 2016, 167, 221-229\nvi Future applications of hydrogen production and CO2 utilization for energy storage: Hybrid Power to Gas-Oxycombustion power plants, Int. J. Hydrogen Energy 2017, Vol.42, 19, 13625-13632\nAnother option to avoid the drawback of attaining pure CO2 is the integration of Power to Gas with amine scrubbing post-combustion capture. In this capture technique, flue gas from an air-fired boiler enters to an absorption column where inert gases bubble out, and CO2 is absorbed by amine. The CO2 rich solvent is then regenerated in a stripping column with counter flowing steam at 100 \u2013 200 \u00b0C, thus obtaining a highly concentrated CO2 flow [20]. The main efficiency penalty comes from the thermal energy required to regenerate the solvent, but it can be diminished by using the exothermal energy generated during methanation. \nAmine capture is the most established and commercially deployed capture technology, hence there already exists studies regarding the application of PtG to power plants with amine capture systems coupled [21][22]. Therefore, the last part of the thesis proposes the novel application of PtG-Amine systems to the chemical industry. The study of this proposal comprises the evaluation of the technical and economic viability of this application for the first time, in which hydrogen is a byproduct coming from electrolytic lines of production of a chemical plant.

The latter item on that list requires a multi\u2010scale evalua\u2010 tion of all aspects of the subsurface geology that can trap CO2 underground and keep it there long term. One part of a containment integrity strategy includes characterization of the caprock at a given site. Many selected sites have clay\u2010rich shales as caprocks, and this contribution will concentrate on workflows and methods for characterizing such rocks in the laboratory. Shale preservation is the most critical step in the process as dehydra\u2010 tion from the native in situ water content significantly affects shale properties. Various mineralogical, micro\u2010 scopical, petrophysical, and geomechanical properties and associated testing methods are discussed, and where possible, examples are shown of the impact of lack of preservation. Results are discussed in the context of inter\u2010 action of CO2 with caprocks and trapping mechanisms. Finally, the discussion looks at a number of the uncer\u2010 tainties associated with laboratory testing of shales in terms of both results obtained to date and our limited understanding as yet of the behavior and interaction of supercritical CO2 with clay\u2010rich caprocks.

In this contribu\u2010 tion, we will concentrate on shale\u2010rich caprocks but acknowledge that other rocks such as anhydrites [e.g., Hangx et al., 2010] are being evaluated as caprocks for CO2 storage sites. However, it should be emphasized that any seal evaluation for a storage site or petroleum prospect should be fully integrated across both fault and top seals and for a wide range of scales. Shale caprock properties are dependent on a number of factors, including depositional environment and resultant lithology, electrochemical conditions at deposition, min\u2010 eralogy, the presence of organic matter, compaction, and diagenetic alteration. All of these processes have a significant impact on porosity and permeability, as well as the mechanical, capillary, and petrophysical properties of shales [e.g., Bennett et  al., 1991a,b; Vernik and Liu, 1997; Dewhurst et al., 1998, 1999a, 1999b; Clennell et al., 2006]. A number of these properties are also controlled by human intervention during and after the coring pro\u2010 cess, such as stress relief microfracture development and drying out and desiccation of recovered core, and care must be taken for certain properties that adequate sample preservation is undertaken [e.g., Schmitt et  al., 1994; Dewhurst et al., 2012; Ewy, 2015]. This study will there\u2010 fore review possible preservation methods and discuss multiple mechanical and petrophysical characterization techniques that can be used to either directly measure or estimate relevant properties required for shale caprocks. 1.2. SHALE PRESERVATION The most critical stage for deriving high\u2010quality labora\u2010 tory results from shales is their immediate preservation on recovery. Loss of pore water from the in situ state can result in changing mechanical, physical, and petrophysi\u2010 cal properties [Schmitt et  al., 1994] no matter whether the shale is soft, weak, and ductile or hard, strong, and brittle. Some pore fluid will always be lost from shales on recovery due to outgassing as cores are depressurized from the in situ conditions to the Earth\u2019s surface [Schmitt et al., 1994]. However, most techniques that look to mea\u2010 sure mechanical and rock physics properties, for example, would look to test the shale using a chemically compat\u2010 ible pore fluid under pressure, and this would generally drive any air into solution at fluid pressures >0.5 MPa. Running such tests under undrained conditions at low strain rates (< 10\u22127  s\u22121) allows monitoring of the pore pressure response either through Skempton B tests [Skempton, 1954] or during axial loading. Pore pressure increase under such conditions is indicative of full satura\u2010 tion. Hence, the slight loss of pore fluid during recovery can be alleviated for such tests. Equilibrating in relative humidity (RH) environments equivalent to shale native water activity can also mitigate this effect [e.g., Steiger and Leung, 1991; Ewy, 2014]. Other tests such as compo\u2010 sition via X\u2010ray diffraction (XRD), cation exchange capacity (CEC), or specific surface area (SSA) measure\u2010 ments generally would not be significantly affected by core preservation, although one should be careful to verify whether the presence of salts (e.g., halite, sylvite) or gypsum is real or artifacts of core storage [e.g., Milliken and Land, 1994]. Ideally, fully saturated core samples should be pre\u2010 served under a nonpolar mineral spirit (e.g., Ondina 15 or Ondina 68) such that the fluid does not interact with the clays present and prevents native pore fluids escaping from the sample. Oil cannot intrude fully water saturated nanopores in shale at ambient pressures due to immisci\u2010 bility and wettability issues. Other potential fluids that can be used for shale preservation include decane [e.g., Ewy et  al., 2008; Ewy, 2014]. Core plugs subsampled from recovered core should also be sealed in glass vials immersed in an appropriate preservative solution. Should such materials not be available, a short\u2010term solution would be to coat cores or plugs in cling film, tin foil, and wax as a short\u2010period (weeks to months) stopgap and kept cool in a fridge (but not frozen). However, it would be preferable to immerse in the fluids suggested above as soon as possible as wax is slightly permeable to air and samples will eventually begin to desiccate. In order to avoid sample desiccation and concomitant alteration of rock properties (see examples below), a workflow has been developed to maximize high\u2010quality results from preserved shale cores (Fig. 1.1). Initially, a whole core is X\u2010ray CT scanned in order to look for fractures, limestone stringers, nodules, and the like. This allows the development of a coring plan (Fig. 1.2) directly linked to the workflow which avoids such features and means that when core plugs are taken, exposure to air is minimized. While conventional rotary coring is some\u2010 times used for harder and more isotropic shales, in gen\u2010 eral a Murg diamond wire bandsaw is used to take core plugs, and these plugs are finished off on a cylindrical grinder. This allows significantly increased core plug recovery and better quality of plugs taken in these noto\u2010 riously difficult\u2010to\u2010prepare rocks. Shales are at their weakest in tension parallel to bedding [e.g., Fj\u00e6r et  al., 2008], and rotary core plugs often lead to biscuiting due to closely spaced fracture development parallel to the fabric anisotropy. The lack of stress induced by torque in the case of the diamond wire bandsaw means that plugs can be taken in more difficult rocks without imposing stresses on the intrinsic planes of weakness in the shale and better plug condition and recovery is the result. This paper will discuss the methods and application of a number of the tests shown in the workflow with a view 0004182022.INDD 4 10/16/2018 7:14:56 AM MICROSTRuCTuRAL, GEOMEChANICAL, ANd PETROPhySICAL ChARACTERIzATION Of ShALE CAPROCkS 5 to characterizing shale top seals for CO2 storage and will also discuss the impact of poor preservation on results. Where possible, examples from CO2 storage sites will be used; otherwise examples from top seals in petroleum systems will be shown. 1.3. MINERALOGY AND MICROSTRUCTURE For a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project to be successful, it needs to guarantee the long\u2010term trapping of the sequestered CO2 underground. In this context, an important aspect to be considered is fluid\u2010rock interac\u2010 tion which results from the contrast in physical properties between the injected CO2 and the in situ pore fluids permeating the storage/sealing rocks and the potential reactivity between CO2 as a free phase and as dissolved carbonic acid in the aqueous phase and the rock it comes in contact with. Through these physical and chemical interactions, the transport, elastic, and mechanical prop\u2010 erties as well as the sealing effectiveness of shale caprocks could be changed, affecting the success of CO2 geose\u2010 questration. A key factor to the understanding and prediction of shale behavior is the proper characteriza\u2010 tion of the various elements that collectively constitute their microstructure. Here we regard the microstructure of shales in the context of CO2 geosequestration as sub\u2010 divided into two components: (i) the minerals and (ii) the pore space; specific techniques to characterize these two components are discussed below. A detailed characterization of the mineral component of shales is desirable as a number of common minerals have been identified as being reactive in the presence of sCO2 and water at temperature and pressure conditions relevant for subsurface carbon dioxide storage. Numerous studies indicate that CO2 trapping via mineral carbon\u2010 ation can occur by dissolution of albite (NaAlSi3O8) and the precipitation of dawsonite [NaAlCO3(OH)2; e.g., Romanov et al., 2015] as well as the dissolution of Mg, Fe\u2010silicates and sulfides, with precipitation of Mg, Fe\u2010carbonates such as siderite and magnesite [e.g., Kaszuba et  al., 2005]. Moreover, recent studies showed that electrical and capillary interactions can occur bet\u2010 ween clay minerals and CO2 in the liquid and supercrit\u2010 ical state.

Distinguished from previous models, a binomial lattice compound real options model including the options to defer and expand is established. Further, the accounting approaches to certified emission reductions (CERs) based on the thermodynamics principle are first proposed concerning this model. We find the total invest value under compound options model is less than zero, although greater than that by NPV method. The results indicate carbon prices and subsidy policy, respectively, play a dominating role in initiating the CCS investment at the first and second stage. The growth in government subsidy at the first stage has obviously greater effects on decreasing critical carbon trading prices. Besides, the minimum critical carbon price is 87.09 RMB/ton with full subsidy, greater than the current price (56 RMB/ton).

Based on the technical work on multiple geologic sites, there appear to be up to four sites within the North Hugoton Storage Complex (NHSC) in Southwest Kansas where >50 million tons CO2 could be injected over a 25- to 30-year period and safely stored in a set of stacked saline aquifers at ideal depths of 5200-6400 ft. The saline aquifers (Mississippian Osage, Ordovician Viola, and Cambrian-Ordovician) are overlain by oil reservoirs that are candidates for CO2 Enhanced Oil recovery (EOR). Of the four possible sites in the NHSC, the Patterson site was chosen as the primary site for a CarbonSAFE Phase II project. Patterson was chosen because the operator of the overlying fields, Berexco, was a long-term research partner of the Kansas Geological Survey (KGS), having participated in several DOE-funded studies with the KGS. Patterson has EOR opportunities in overlying reservoirs and most of the prospective injection site is already unitized.\n Capture, compression and transportation of large volumes of CO2 is economic in the region, particularly since the extension and expansion of Federal 45Q tax credits in February 2018 that provide $35/ton for CO2 stored during EOR and $50/ton if stored in a saline reservoir and can be captured for a 12-year period. Without these credits, saline aquifer storage is not economically viable. The most economic scenario involves CO2 aggregated from multiple ethanol plants via small-diameter pipelines that tie into a main trunk line for delivery to market. CO2 EOR likely needs to be part of the system to provide economy of scale and, potentially, additional subsidy for saline aquifer injection through CO2 sales. High capture costs at the two power plants and refinery in this study make them non-economic options without further subsidy that may arise from a large regional pipeline system.\n Legal, regulatory, public policy aspects of a project of the scale envisioned will require significant changes at the State level. In particular, legislation that would regulate capture, transportation, injection and storage as a public utility would be required along with allowances for eminent domain to be used for pipeline right-of-way and pooling of pore space. Streamlining the U.S. EPA UIC Class VI well permit process and/or establishing State primacy would further support development of commercial-scale CCS.

The gasification and gas processing steps however have multiple temperature and flow constraints which severely limit the flexibility of IGCC plants to meet the dynamic demands of the current grid. To address this issue, a CaO-based energy storage system has recently been proposed to substantially increase the load range of a base IGCC plant without cycling the gasifier island.In this work, further storage configurations have been assessed, addressing the inefficiencies identified in previous work. In particular, the following cases have been investigated: directly fired calciners with varying make-up flow rate to minimize the purge stream energy loss, directly fired calciners with improved heat integration to reduce the calciner syngas demand and an indirectly fired calciner to minimize the ASU penalty. Additionally, an alternative storage integration strategy after the Selexol unit has been compared both with respect to its performance and its impact on the base IGCC plant design and operation. To this end, process simulation was undertaken in Aspen Plus\u2122. As demonstrated, the CaO based energy storage system can be effectively used to modulate the IGCC net power output by \u00b120\u201325%, while maintaining the capture capacity of 90% of the CO2-emissions.

Two options were examined for transporting and disposing the captured CO{sub 2}. In one case, CO{sub 2} was pumped from a land-based collection center through long pipelines laid on the ocean floor. Another case considered oceanic tanker transport of liquid carbon dioxide to an offshore floating structure for vertical injection to the ocean floor. In the latter case, a novel concept based on subsurface towing of a 3000-meter pipe, and attaching it to the offshore structure was considered. Budgetary cost estimates indicate that for distances greater than 400 km, tanker transportation and offshore injection through a 3000-meter vertical pipe provides the best method for delivering liquid CO{sub 2} to deep ocean floor depressions. For shorter distances, CO{sub 2} delivery by parallel-laid, subsea pipelines is more cost-effective. Estimated costs for 500-km transport and storage at a depth of 3000 meters by subsea pipelines and tankers were 1.5 and 1.4 dollars per ton of stored CO{sub 2}, respectively. At these prices, economics of ocean disposal are highly favorable.

Cost-Risk Analysis (CRA), a hybrid of Cost-Effectiveness Analysis (CEA) and Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), has been proposed as an alternative to CEA as a decision criterion for evaluating climate policy. It weighs mitigation costs against associated risks of violating a predefined temperature guardrail, thereby enabling an analysis of otherwise infeasible temperature targets. Under CEA, delaying climate policy causes infeasibility of temperature targets which was resolved by the assessment under CRA. Indeed, CRA enables a quantitative evaluation of any delay scenario, thereby yielding information of the severeness of postponing climate policy. Alternatively, negative emission technologies have been included in CEA to enlarge the leeway in decision making and postpone infeasibility. This study closes the loop by evaluating the impact of the technology option BECCS (Bioenergy and Carbon Capture and Storage) in light of delayed climate policy under CRA. The work is conducted using the Integrated Assessment Model MIND (Model of Investment and Technological Development). This interplay creates the following insights: An inclusion of BECCS avoids corner solutions that were previously identified for delay scenarios, yielding a larger window of opportunity for action to mitigate climate change. Moreover, it postpones mitigation efforts into the future and removes the pressure to shut down fossil fuel use immediately. Thereby, mitigation-induced welfare losses are reduced substantially. BECSS, when evaluated under CRA, has confirmed well-known results from CEA. However, in contrast to results derived from CEA, mitigation-induced welfare losses decline with delay, while climate risk-induced welfare losses increase with delay by approximately the same magnitude. Hence within CRA, BECCS reduces the welfare effect of delayed climate policy by an order of magnitude. This underlines the crucial role of BECCS for the case of delay, even if one changes the decision-analytic framework from CEA to CRA and thereby softened the temperature target.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "f062fd7db2d915ac236e03d5c56cc6f3c60b8dec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2189387211", "CorpusId": 54879805}, "title": "An overview of carbon dioxide sequestration in depl eted oil and gas reservoirs in Florida, USGS Petroleum Province 50", "abstract": "Throughout the world, CO 2 is viewed as the major component in greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere.

Previous studies assumed CO2 sourcing from nearby coal or natural gas power plants. This may not be viable at a large scale or for the long term. The diurnal algal growth cycle imposes additional system design challenges for CO2 delivery. For ethanol produced by cyanobacteria in photobioreactors, we design onsite systems that provide heat, power and CO2 (CHP\u2010CO2), fueled by natural gas or biomass. Meeting the CO2 requirement produces excess electricity, which can be sold back to the grid. The scale of the CHP\u2010CO2 can be reduced by night\u2010time capture and refrigerated storage of CO2. The lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for 1 MJ ethanol are about \u221219\u2009g CO2e for biomass CHP\u2010CO2, and +31\u201335 CO2e g for natural gas CHP\u2010CO2 options, compared with +19\u2009g CO2e for the direct use of coal flue gas, and 91.3\u2009g CO2e for 1\u2009MJ of conventional gasoline.

There is debate about how much additional carbon can be stored annually in soil, and for how long, following change in land use or management (Smith, 2014) and resolving this question is important. This is particularly relevant now following the aspirational goal established in the 4 per mille initiative (4p1000, 2017). In a paper titled: \u201cContinuous soil carbon storage of old permanent pastures in Amazonia\u201d, Stahl et al. (2017) purported to show increases in soil carbon when tropical forests are converted to grazed pasture of about 5.3 t C ha 1 year 1 through stock measurements across a chronosequence of sites. They state in the abstract: \u201c. . . our results show that if sustainable management is applied in tropical pastures coming from deforestation. . . they can ensure a continuous C storage\u201d, in the discussion: \u201cThis result supports the idea that certain ecosystems such as permanent pasture continuously accumulate soil carbon in the long-term (ie several decades).\u201d and later in the conclusions: \u201cMoreover, the humified C stored in the deeper soil layers is likely to provide unlimited C accumulation and conservation of C in the long-term.\u201d (Italics added). Continuous and unlimited accumulation of soil carbon would certainly be of great interest to researchers, policy makers and the broader public as a large contributor to mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, particularly at rates as high as 5 t C ha 1 year . However, continuous and unlimited carbon accumulation is not supported by the author\u2019s data or the general literature. Using measurements of soil carbon stocks in a chronosequence of sites converted from forest to pasture, they reported no change in soil carbon for the first 24 years followed by increases in soil carbon between 24 and 36 years at 5 t C ha 1 year . From these data, it is not reasonable to extrapolate these increases for 12 years as continuous or unlimited without further justification. In the broader literature, it has been widely observed that carbon reaches a plateau in roughly 30 to 50 years or perhaps 100 years after system perturbation as new equilibrium is reached, and that pastures are not perpetual sinks of carbon (Smith, 2014). Soil carbon accumulation rates of greater than 1 t C ha 1 year 1 are also rare (Conant, Cerri, Osborne, & Paustian, 2017). At face value, accumulation of 5 t ha 1 year 1 would also require a high proportion of the gross primary production (GPP) captured as soil carbon rather than lost as carbon dioxide. Assuming a GPP of about 22 t C ha 1 for a high productivity pasture (e.g., Rutledge et al., 2015) would mean that 20%\u201325% of GPP was stabilized in soil every year for ~12 years. Additionally, by the end of the chronosequence the soil had a C:N ratio of 20 and was gaining of 5 t C ha 1 year 1 which would require a net nitrogen storage in soil organic matter (not in plants) of 250 kg N ha 1 year . In the absence of nitrogen fertilizer inputs, gross biological nitrogen fixation rates would need to be in excess of 250 kg N ha 1 year 1 from a reported legume cover of <10%. So what could be an alternative explanation for the trends observed in the data of the authors? Parsimoniously, the chronosequence sites may not have been derived from the same starting point as they were situated some 200 km apart and matching sites across such a wide geographical space is difficult (Walker, Wardle, Bardgett, & Clarkson, 2010). The parent materials of soils were matched by examining geological outcrops on roads. This is a rather limited approach to ensuring the landscape started at the same carbon stocks, particularly as the chronosequence length is only 36 years. Indeed, inspection of the soil texture data in the author\u2019s supplemental material had % sand of between 11% and 73% (average 48%, SD 15%), which does not support the contention that these soils were initially the same. Alternatively, these pastures may not have reached a new steady state within the time frame of the chronosequence and rates of accumulation will decrease as this steady state is reached, consistent with all other long-term experiments in the literature (Smith, 2014). Certainly, 12 years is not long enough to determine whether a new equilibrium has been reached. The data presented provide evidence of increased soil carbon stocks when Amazonian forest is converted to pasture, confirming a trend shown by some (Neill et al., 1997) but not all (Don, Schumacher, & Freibauer, 2011). However, labelling any gains observed as a continuous sink of carbon could lead to false hope by land owners and incorrectly inform policy makers. It should further be noted that only about 10% of the total ecosystem carbon lost after deforestation (due to tree removal, burning etc.) can be recovered through soil carbon sequestration (Fearnside, 1997; Neill et al., 1997). It remains critical that we determine rates of long-term carbon accumulation and how long they are sustained if we are to make progress towards the 4 per mille aspirational goal but methodological approaches require careful consideration.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "e3925a0ab66964e1ed67a14bfdd3d5505eb7eb0b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2005930958", "DOI": "10.1063/1.4825432", "CorpusId": 54994436}, "title": "Measurement and RANS modelling of large-scale under-expanded CO2 releases for CCS applications", "abstract": "The deployment of a complete carbon-capture and storage chain requires a focus upon the hazards posed by the operation of CO2 pipelines, and the consequences of accidental release must be considered as an integral part of the design process.

The quantity of CO2 that can be stored via solubility depends on the composition of the formation waters and is greatly enhanced by increasing the pH and the formation of aqueous carbonate complexes. \u00a9 2010 the European Mineralogical Union and the Mineralogical Society of Great Britain&Ireland.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "bd338449b2f4aa4e66b92ea8f597b285b702d734", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 53143431}, "title": "Renewable Gas \u2014 Vision for a Sustainable Gas Network", "abstract": "\u0090 \u0090Government\u0090support\u0090is\u0090critical\u0090in\u0090 developing\u0090this\u0090resource\u0090and,\u0090without\u0090 action\u0090now,\u0090a\u0090great\u0090opportunity\u0090could\u0090\u0090 be\u0090missed.\u0090 The move toward a low-carbon economy is picking up momentum.

The process, dubbed WindFuels, requires no biomass, and it is expected to solve the grid stability and energy storage challenges of wind energy. The process is based largely on the commercially proven technologies of wind energy, water electrolysis, and Fischer Tropsch Synthesis (FTS) chemistry. Wind energy is used to electrolyze water into hydrogen and oxygen. Some of the hydrogen is used in a process, the so-called reverse water gas shift (RWGS) reaction, that reduces CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO) and water. The CO and the balance of the hydrogen are fed into an FT reactor, similar to that commonly used to produce fuels and chemicals from coal or natural gas. Improved sub-processes have been simulated in detail, and key experiments will soon be carried out to help optimize process conditions. Conversion efficiencies (from input electrical to output chemical) are expected to approach 60%. Putting renewable hydrogen into liquid fuels solves the distribution and storage problems that have beset utilization of hydrogen in vehicles. Converting CO2 into fuels can eliminate the need for CO2 sequestration and reduce global CO2 emissions by 40% by mid-century. The amount of water needed for the renewable FTS (RFTS) process is an order of magnitude less than needed for biofuels. The atmosphere will eventually provide an unlimited source for CO2 , though initially the CO2 would come from ammonia plants, biofuel refineries, cement factories, fossil power plants, and ore refineries.

Worst-case scenarios of high emissions and climate sensitivity might preclude to a certain extent the use of carbon sequestration as a substitute for fossil energy reductions.

Injection of carbon dioxide into coal seams is a promising technology for reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and increasing ultimate production of coalbed methane. Reservoir simulations are an inexpensive method for designing field projects and predicting optimal tradeoffs between maximum sequestration and maximum methane production. Optimum project design and operation are expected to depend on the anisotropy of the permeability along the face-cleat and buttcleat directions, the spacing between cleats, and the sorption isotherms for methane and carbon dioxide. In this work PSU-COALCOMP, a dual-porosity coalbed methane simulator, is used to model primary and secondary production of methane from coal, for a variety of coal properties and operational parameters. It is assumed that the face and butt cleats are perpendicular to each other, with horizontal wells parallel to one type of cleat and perpendicular to the other. The well pattern consists of four horizontal production wells that form a rectangle, with four shorter horizontal wells centered within the rectangle. In the limiting case of no permeability anisotropy, the central wells form a \u201cplus\u201d sign within the square of production wells. All wells are operated as producers of methane and water until a specified reservoir pressure is reached, after which the central wells are operated as injectors for CO2. Production of methane continues until the CO2 concentration in the produced gas is too high. The simulation results predict the optimum lengths of the injection wells along the faceand butt-cleat directions, and how these optimum lengths depend on the permeabilities in the two directions. If the cleat spacing is sufficiently small and diffusion of the gas through the pores to the cleats is sufficiently rapid, instantaneous sorption may be assumed. Otherwise, the field performance depends on the characteristic time for transport to the cleats. The pressures at which the injection wells are operated also affect the amounts of CO2 sequestered, through the pressure and volume constants of the sorption isotherms. Introduction and Background Increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases may be leading to changes in the Earth\u2019s climate. A rise in the globe\u2019s average temperature is expected, among other consequences. The main anthropogenic greenhouse gas is CO2. The concentration of the CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing continuously; therefore many countries have pledged to reduce, by 2010, the emissions of greenhouse gases up to 8% relative to levels pertaining to 1990 (1). Consequently, CO2 must be captured and stored. Among storage options, the underground storage in depleted oil and gas reservoirs and unminable coals are considered the most economical and have a low environmental impact. Several Federal agencies have major programs for CO2 sequestration (2). Unminable coal seams are a very attractive potential storage medium for CO2. The injection of CO2 in coalbeds may be the most efficient option of all storage possibilities, because while CO2 is stored, the recovery of coalbed methane is accelerated. The process of displacing the remaining methane by CO2 after the primary production of methane is referred to as enhanced coal bed methane (ECBM). Carbon dioxide-ECBM technology and implementation was inspired by CO2 solvent flooding, one of the most successful Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods in the U.S. and worldwide (3). The worldwide CO2-sequestration potential using ECBM has been estimated at 150Gt of CO2. A relatively small but significant sequestration potential of 5-15 Gt may be profitable, generating net profits estimated at $15/t for the most favorable cases (4,5).

The risk assessment requires determination of the random variables that will influence the functioning of the system. It is very difficult to set-up a probability distribution of a random variable in the classical sense (objective probability) when a particular event rarely occurred or even it has an incomplete development. In this situation, we have to determine the subjective probability, especially at an early stage of projects, when we have not enough information about the system. This subjective probability is constructed from assessment of expert judgement to estimate the possibility of certain random events could happen depending on geological features of the area of application. The proposed methodology is based on the application of Bayesian probabilistic networks to estimate the probability of risk of leakage.

In the United Kingdom (UK), large amounts of price-insensitive and variable-output wind generation is expected to be deployed to contribute towards renewable energy and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission targets. Wind generation, with near-zero marginal costs, limited predictability, and a limited ability to provide upward dispatch, displaces price-setting thermal power plants, with higher marginal costs, changing flexibility and reserve requirements. New-build, commercial-scale, and lowcarbon generation capacity, such as CO2 capture and storage (CCS) and nuclear, may impact power system flexibility and ramping capabilities. Low-carbon generation portfolios with price-sensitive thermal power plants and energy storage are therefore likely to be required to manage increased levels of variability and uncertainty at operational timescales. This work builds on a high-resolution wind reanalysis dataset of UK wind sites. The locations of existing and proposed wind farms are used to produce plausible and internally consistent wind deployment scenarios that represent the spatial distribution of future UK wind capacity. Temporally consistent electricity demand data is used to characterise and assess demand-wind variability and net demand ramp events. A unit commitment and economic dispatch (UCED) model is developed to evaluate the likely operating regimes of thermal power plants and CCSequipped units across a range of future UK wind scenarios. Security constraints for reserve and power plant operating constraints, such as power output limits, ramp rates, minimum up/down times, and start-up times, ensure the operational feasibility of dispatch schedules. The load factors, time spent at different loads, and the ramping and start-up requirements of thermal power plants are assessed. CO2 duration curves are developed to assess the impacts of increasing wind capacity on the distribution of CO2 emissions. A sensitivity analysis investigates the impacts of part-load efficiency losses, ramp rates, minimum up/down times, and start-up/shut-down costs on power plant operating regimes and flexibility requirements. The interactions between a portfolio of energy storage units and flexible CO2 capture units are then explored. This multi-disciplinary research presents a temporally-explicit and detailed assessment of operational flexibility requirements at full 8760 hour resolution, highlighting the non-linear impacts of increasing wind capacity.

In pursuit of this plan, China faces two material challenges in implementing its CCS strategy. The first is a lack of suitable onshore sites in the southern areas close to the industrial centers of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Shanghai. Their local geography and geology favors the use of offshore CCS; there are large suitable basins offshore most of southeastern China. Thus China needs to consider the inclusion of offshore CCS options. Second, China has announced its intent to leverage the finance options afforded under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol.

Field testing of ACI options was performed on one-quarter of Unit 2 at TXU's Big Brown Steam Electric Station. Unit 2 has a design output of 600 MW and burns a blend of 70% Texas Gulf Coast lignite and 30% subbituminous Powder River Basin coal. Big Brown employs a COHPAC configuration, i.e., high air-to-cloth baghouses following cold-side electrostatic precipitators (ESPs), for particulate control. When sorbent injection is added between the ESP and the baghouse, the combined technology is referred to as TOXECON{trademark} and is patented by the Electric Power Research Institute in the United States. Key benefits of the TOXECON configuration include better mass transfer characteristics of a fabric filter compared to an ESP for mercury capture and contamination of only a small percentage of the fly ash with AC. The field testing consisted of a baseline sampling period, a parametric screening of three sorbent injection options, and a month long test with a single mercury control technology. During the baseline sampling, native mercury removal was observed to be less than 10%. Parametric testing was conducted for three sorbent injection options: injection of standard AC alone; injection of an EERC sorbent enhancement additive, SEA4, with ACI; and injection of an EERC enhanced AC. Injection rates were determined for all of the options to achieve the minimum target of 55% mercury removal as well as for higher removals approaching 90%. Some of the higher injection rates were not sustainable because of increased differential pressure across the test baghouse module. After completion of the parametric testing, a month long test was conducted using the enhanced AC at a nominal rate of 1.5 lb/Macf. During the time that enhanced AC was injected, the average mercury removal for the month long test was approximately 74% across the test baghouse module. ACI was interrupted frequently during the month long test because the test baghouse module was bypassed frequently to relieve differential pressure. The high air-to-cloth ratio of operations at this unit results in significant differential pressure, and thus there was little operating margin before encountering differential pressure limits, especially at high loads. This limited the use of sorbent injection as the added material contributes to the overall differential pressure. This finding limits sustainable injection of AC without appropriate modifications to the plant or its operations. Handling and storage issues were observed for the TOXECON ash-AC mixture. Malfunctioning equipment led to baghouse dust hopper plugging, and storage of the stagnant material at flue gas temperatures resulted in self-heating and ignition of the AC in the ash. In the hoppers that worked properly, no such problems were reported. Economics of mercury control at Big Brown were estimated for as-tested scenarios and scenarios incorporating changes to allow sustainable operation.

This technology is based on the bottling of liquid CO 2 at high pressure inside capsules made of glass that are delivered to the bottom of the ocean via a proper pipeline. A Life Cycle Assessment that considers all the stages of the process and 13 impact categories, with a focus on climate change, shows an impact in the four case studies between 0.084 and 0.132\u00a0ton of CO 2 equivalent (eq) per ton of CO 2 stored. Since carbonation of cement materials over their life cycle is a significant and growing net sink of CO 2 , the capture and storage of CO 2 emissions generated during the production of cement might lead to negative emissions. A cost analysis was also performed, including the capital costs and the operational costs, even considering the funding structure through financing and equity. The costs of the four case studies are from 16 to 29\u00a0$/tCO 2 . Although further work is needed to assess in detail some aspects of the design, the result of this stage of the research allows concluding that the application of the CSCS in cement plants is an interesting option for achieving negative emissions, even if limited due the slowness of CO 2 uptake during the lifetime of cement materials.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "9ba247251e800e4dd1a1f526f3635025988145b6", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 15159421}, "title": "GHGT-10 Phase diagrams of CO 2 and CO 2N 2 gas mixtures and their application in compression processes", "abstract": "Phase diagrams of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and their mixtures with different amounts of nitrogen (e.g. 5 mol%, 10 mol% N2) were calculated with high accuracy with the NIST Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport Properties database program REFPROP\u00ae for up to 200 bar, as well as density-pressure diagrams. Beside the use of carbon dioxide as a solvent for supercritical fluid extraction, increasing interest in physical chemical properties of CO2 exists as Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) starts to play an important role to limit anthropogenic emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. Therefore CO2 processing and pipeline technologies became of considerable commercial importance, especially in the context of future underground storage of CO2. As example the CO2 compression process with gas separation membrane in post-combustion capture was simulated with PRO/II\u00ae software. Through adopting several different equations of states, phase diagrams of different CO2 N2 gas mixtures were calculated and compared with the aforementioned accurate thermodynamic and transport properties calculation results. This type of validation is very useful for process engineering analysis. Further investigations related to the compression process were carried out for the different CO2 gas mixtures, which are generated from the gas separation membrane capture process. Specific energy of the compression process was analysed for each gas mixture. The energy consumption and the state of the compressed compounds are strongly influenced by the N2 composition in the mixture.

Use of biological organism complexes such as algae and oysters to sequester carbon can provide a sustainable solar based solution for carbon capture and storage (CCS) to mitigate the risks of climate change. On a carbon per time per surface area basis, these reefs can be orders of magnitude more effective than grass based systems and significantly more effective than some tree based systems. Concerns over ocean acidification also suggest removal of carbon from the ocean. However, oysters alone are animals which are net producers of carbon dioxide, whereas oysters coupled with algae can be net long term carbon sequesterers, therefore the net carbon sequestration potential of the Eastern Oyster Crassostrea virginica with algae species. A system was designed to assess growth of both algae and oysters in a completely closed system. Relevant parameters include CO2 and O2 in air and water; shell carbon sequestration, wet and dry biomass, net algae concentrations, and pH. Results include quantification of carbon sequestered in various normalized formats and suggest the algae-oyster complex provides significant long term sustainable carbon sequestration potential.

However, it remains challenging to address the tradeoff between adsorption capacity and selectivity, on account of their similar physical properties and molecular sizes. To overcome this difficulty, here we report a novel strategy involving the regulation of a hydrogen-bonding nanotrap on the pore surface to promote the separation of C2H2/CO2 mixtures in three isostructural metal-organic frameworks (MOFs, named MIL-160, CAU-10H, and CAU-23, respectively). Among them, MIL-160, which has abundant hydrogen-bonding acceptors as nanotraps, can selectively capture acetylene molecules and demonstrates an ultrahigh C2H2 storage capacity (191 cm3 g-1, or 213 cm3 cm-3) but much less CO2 uptake (90 cm3 g-1) under ambient conditions. The C2H2 adsorption amount of MIL-160 is remarkably higher than those for the other two isostructural MOFs (86 and 119 cm3 g-1 for CAU-10H and CAU-23, respectively) under the same conditions. More importantly, both simulation and experimental breakthrough results show that MIL-160 sets a new benchmark for equimolar C2H2/CO2 separation in terms of the separation potential (\u0394qbreak = 5.02 mol/kg) and C2H2 productivity (6.8 mol/kg). In addition, in situ FT-IR experiments and computational modeling further reveal that the unique host-guest multiple hydrogen-bonding interaction between the nanotrap and C2H2 is the key factor for achieving the extraordinary acetylene storage capacity and superior C2H2/CO2 selectivity. This work provides a novel and powerful approach to address the tradeoff of this extremely challenging gas separation.", "year": 2021}]}
