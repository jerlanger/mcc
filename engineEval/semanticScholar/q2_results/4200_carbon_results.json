We develop a partial-equilibrium model of the European power market that contributes with a framework for capturing the temporal and spatial variability of RES.

The 2050 generation share of wind and solar power combined is around 40%.

In the European Union, energy policies are articulated around three different elements: measures to promote renewable energy technologies, the emissions certificates system and both energy-saving and energy-efficiency policies. The succession of directives and communications from the EU Commission on renewable technology generation share targets and the implementation of the European Emissions Market exemplify the serious EU commitment to a more environmentally friendly future. CCS technologies\u2014together with RES technologies\u2014are thus key to achieve the European emissions reduction target. Although the CCS commercial availability is not guaranteed\u2014due to a slow technological development\u2014some institutions, such as the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies, assume, for 2030 horizon, a quick development of this technology, growing until a maximum participation of an 18\u00a0% over the fossil fuels total generation. An eventual non-availability of these technologies in 2030 could increase the cost of this objective in a 70\u00a0%. Therefore, the achievement of pollutant emissions reduction targets depends on a correct design of the European generation technologies mix, which should include CCS technologies. Nevertheless, the uncertainty about the final costs and economic risk of these technologies makes a question about their future role to arise. This paper analyses the effects of different variations in the cost and risk of the CCS technologies (scenarios) over the European power technologies mix. The results confirm the need of the availability of these technologies in 2030, beyond the potential costs and risks of both options.

Evidence from participatory future land use scenarios in Peru, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Mexico", "abstract": "Revenues derived from carbon have been seen as an important tool for supporting forest conservation over the past decade. At the same time, there is high uncertainty about how much revenue can reasonably be expected from land use emissions reductions initiatives. Despite this uncertainty, REDD\u00fe projects and conservation initiatives that aim to take advantage of available or, more commonly, future funding from carbon markets have proliferated. This study used participatory multi-stakeholder workshops to develop divergent future scenarios of land use in eight landscapes in four countries around the world: Peru, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Mexico. The results of these future scenario building exercises were analyzed using a new tool, CarboScen, for calculating the landscape carbon storage implications of different future land use scenarios. The findings suggest that potential revenues from carbon storage or emissions reductions are significant in some landscapes (most notably the peat forests of Indonesia), and much less significant in others (such as the low-carbon forests of Zanzibar and the interior of Tanzania). The findings call into question the practicality of many conservation programs that hinge on expectations of future revenue from carbon finance. The future scenarios-based approach is useful to policy-makers and conservation program developers in distinguishing between landscapes where carbon finance can substantially support conservation, and landscapes where other strategies for conservation and land use should be prioritized. 5 Information on INDCs compiled by WRI in the Climate Data Explorer: http://cait.wri.org/indc/. Introduction Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, forestry, and other land uses is a growing priority as part of a global strategy for mitigating climate change, particularly in the wake of the climate agreement at the December 2015 Conference of Parties in Paris. Across landscapes (defined broadly for the purposes of this article as well-defined geographic areas of various sizes with multiple land uses), decisions about land use have implications for carbon emissions and storage. Global initiatives like REDD\u00fe (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries) have explicitly sought to reward reductions inemissions fromlandusechanges suchasdeforestation and forest degradation. Outside of the explicit remit of REDD\u00fe, national and voluntary carbon markets are \u00a9 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd aiming to do the same. A number of the countries that are signatories to the Paris agreement include landand forest-based commitments in their IntendedNationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. To varying degrees, individuals, organizations, and initiatives that work at the intersection of land use and climate change have favored carbon markets as critical mechanisms to support emissions reductions (Lederer 2012, Martius et al 2015). Proponents of carbon markets have argued that such funding is needed to sustain emissions reductions from land use, as grants or other funds will be insufficient (Angelsen et al 2012). Also, proponents argue, market mechanisms Environ. Res. Lett. 12 (2017) 014015 are uniquely positioned to catch the eye and capture the imagination of the private sector (IETA 2014), which is required, many argue, if we hope to see a global sea change towards low-emissions land uses (de Sassi et al 2014). A robust and well-designed global carbon market is, according to such proponents, an optimal instrument for efficiently allocating emissions reductions from land use (and, indeed, other sectors) across private and also public actors around the world. Criticisms of carbon markets as instruments of low-emissions development rest on multiple lines of reasoning. Some oppose the commodification of carbon altogether, considering it morally objectionable (Collard and Dempsey 2013, Leggett and Lovell 2012, Page 2013, Stephan and Paterson 2012), or believe it will lead to decisions made based on carbon, or profits, alone, without consideration of local livelihoods or equity (Benessaiah 2012, Corbera and Brown 2010, Kosoy and Corbera 2010 ). Others fear that market-based approaches to conservation, and especially offsets may lead to \u2018green-washing\u2019 with companies justifying large emissions in other sectors by marginal reductions through forestry and other land use activities (Pearse 2012, Polonsky and Garma 2008, Polonsky et al 2010). Still others stress that the effectiveness of even a well-designed global carbon market is ultimately constrained by the domestic policy commitments to emissions reductions that accompany it (Green et al 2014). Unless countries impose serious caps on emissions that require costly compliance from their private sectors, even the most institutionally robust carbon market will not lead to the desired lowemissions development outcomes. As movement towards meaningful caps that would generate high global carbon prices has been slow, this latter line of thinking leads to the conclusion that carbon markets \u2014and indeed all kinds of performance-based payments conditioned on carbon emissions reductions\u2014 will be inadequate to the task of meaningfully contributing to climate change mitigation. In this paper, we assess these latter concerns about carbon markets, and performance-based payments that focus on carbon emissions reductions, by examining the potential of specific landscapes to generate carbon revenues. We ask, with the growing importance of climate change on the global agenda, should carbon now be the centerpiece of conservation initiatives? To what extent does the potential for carbon emissions reductions from land use justify the priority focus that funding from carbon markets has received in initiatives like REDD\u00fe? We address these questions by examining the impact of plausible land use futures on carbon, and by extension, the potential revenue that could reasonably be generated in landscapes under distinct, plausible but possibly extreme, future scenarios of land use. The research presented here provides preliminary answers for specific landscapes, based on eight participatory 2 workshops undertaken in four countries (Peru, Indonesia, Tanzania, and Mexico) to explore future land use scenarios. We first briefly discuss the workshop methodology and the landscapes that we worked in. Next, we analyze the future scenarios that emerged from the workshops, highlighting their carbon storage and emissions implications. Finally, we discuss these findings in the context of the broader carbon-market and performance-based payment agenda, finding support for the position that carbon-based payments for conservation, delivered through markets or otherwise, are likely appropriate in someplaces but not in others.We suggest that our workshop methodology is a useful tool for distinguishing between such landscapes, and thus for decision-making and policy. Given that some landscapeswithoutmuch realpotential forcarbonemissions reductions have been targeted byREDD\u00fe interventions aiming to generate revenues from carbon markets, we suggest that decision-makers have underappreciated these distinctions.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "aba14143a172a79b91cefed356aeeb89b5c2ace7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3001529872", "DOI": "10.23919/OCEANS40490.2019.8962746", "CorpusId": 208094097}, "title": "Natural seabed gas leakage -- variability imposed by tidal cycles", "abstract": "The likelihood of leakage from sub-seabed Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) sites has been debated since geological storage was proposed as an effective option to remove greenhouse gas emissions from the climate system.

When determining estimates of gas escape across the seabed, the influence of dynamic environments, introducing natural variations in seepage rates must be considered, including tidal cycles. Panarea, Sicily, is the location of a series of natural marine CO2 gas seeps and provides an excellent test bed to investigate variations of natural seabed gas leakage across a tidal cycle.

We show that the tidal height correlates negatively with the bubble sound power spectral density, the gas flux, and the bubble size.

Japanese utility companies are advancing various measures to improve plant thermal efficiency and to promote utilization of biomass as a fuel. In Europe and America, CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technology is regarded as one effective approach, and various demonstration projects are planned all over the world. However, the introduction of conventional CO2 capture system to power station causes a decrease in the plant thermal efficiency and an increase in the power generating cost. In this reason, it is necessary to develop a new power generating system with high thermal efficiency. Therefore, Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) proposed an innovative integrated coal gasification combined cycle power generating system (IGCC) with CO2 capture whose plant thermal efficiency is very high, and is working on the research and development of the new system. This is a system to combine a new oxygen-CO2 blown coal gasifier in that captured CO2 is used with the closed gas turbine in which coal gas from the gasifier is burned with the gas mixed oxygen and recycled exhaust CO2 . The system has the following features. The gasification performances improve greatly. The processes of concentrating and separating CO2 are unnecessary. It is estimated that the carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) and the cold gas efficiency (CGE) in oxygen-CO2 blown gasifier improve more than conventional oxygen blown gasifiers by the effect of the gasification reaction promotion of CO2 by gasifying coal with oxygen and CO2 . As a result, the gasifier and the char recycling system can make to compact, and the equipment cost can be reduced. This paper reports on examination of CO2 promotion effect on the gasification performances by gasification test using a bench scale gasifier facility.Copyright \u00a9 2011 by ASME", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "93da6f4210ad81d59ff5f8444ac536b509646cdf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2116030397", "DOI": "10.1007/S11149-013-9220-0", "CorpusId": 154417841}, "title": "Flexible mandates for investment in new technology", "abstract": "Environmental regulators often seek to promote forefront technology for new investments; however, technology mandates are suspected of raising cost and delaying investment.

Leakage rates from geological formations are poorly constrained, and are therefore an unknown factor in CCS feasibility studies. Natural CO2 reservoirs in the Colorado Plateau, USA, are analogues for geological storage. In places CO2 has migrated to the surface along fault zones, forming CO2-charged springs and geysers. Recent drilling for oil and water has also provided rapid pathways for CO2 migration. Uranium-series dating of travertine mounds along two fault zones in Utah has provided insight to the timing and rates of leakage along these faults. A continuous record of leakage has been preserved over the last 315ka, with the oldest dated mound at 413ka. The position of leakage has switched through time, and individual pathways have been utilised more than once for flow. Combining dates with volume measurements from these mounds it is possible to calculate the rates and volumes of flow in individual pathways and the long-term time-averaged CO2 leakage rate for the entire system. The observation that leakage of CO2-rich groundwater from a fault can occur for hundreds of thousands of years has implications for geological storage of CO2.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "02f22b26bb5ba3f0f5dd6260b895e8dd1d0094b9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2100734557", "DOI": "10.1002/anie.201207908", "CorpusId": 9782080, "PubMed": "23404742"}, "title": "Metal-organic framework thin films: crystallite orientation dependent adsorption.", "abstract": "Porous metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have risen to their fame in material science in the past decades owing to their intrinsic porosities, diversified topologies, and tailored structures and properties, all of which are attractive for a wide spectrum of promising applications for gas storage/separation, greenhouse gas capture, catalysis and sensors, as well as newly established applications in membranes, thin film devices, and biomedical imaging. MOFs as adsorbents, especially for H2, CO2, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs, typical hydrocarbons and alcohols, etc.) separation have attracted attention for energy and environmental technologies. Sterics (size/shape exclusion), thermodynamic equilibrium, as well as kinetic and quantum sieving effects are dominant factors in a separation process involving porous materials. Like other kinds of porous materials such as carbon, zeolites, and silica films, MOFs provide interesting potential for selective adsorption and separation at the molecular level because of their pore structures and sizes which can be precisely controlled at the molecular level. In principle, MOFs crystallized as anisotropic crystallographic systems should exhibit distinct adsorption kinetics for adsorbates approaching from different directions owing to varied pore openings. Nevertheless, most property studies of MOFs have dealt with nanoscale bulky powder or singlecrystal samples with randomly distributed crystallite orientations, which exhibits overall adsorption kinetics from all orientations. In contrast, the anisotropic nature of MOF crystals is averaged. One of the very few examples is the anisotropic [{Cu2(bza)4(pyz)}n] (bza = benzoate; pyz = pyrazine) as a single-crystal membrane for gas separation, in which the aligned channels gave rise to a much higher permeance and permeation selectivity for H2 and CO2 than observed for the nonporous direction. Nevertheless, this study on one single crystal may have limited importance for direct applications since it is challenging to grow large single crystals of MOFs. Advanced thin film/membrane technologies have been coupled with MOFs, and typical examples are ZIF-based membranes. Such membranes displayed superior gas separation performance, and could provide an alternative way of using MOF materials in separation technologies. Although adsorption properties on some well-oriented MOF thin films/membranes have been reported, to the best of our knowledge, no orientation-dependent adsorption on MOF thin films or homogenous ensembles of oriented MOF crystallites attached to surfaces (SURMOFs) has ever been studied. To investigate anisotropic properties, the first task was to prepare a MOF thin-film material, or better said, a homogeneous sample of MOF crystallites attached to a suitable surface with controlled, uniform orientation. Step-by-step liquid-phase epitaxy (LPE) is suited for this purpose, and involves the oriented growth of MOF nanoand microsized crystallites regulated by the functionality of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on substrates. Typically, HKUST1 coatings with [100] and [111] orientations can be fabricated on carboxylateand hydroxy-terminated SAMs, respectively, on substrates.

INTRODUCTION Of the many environmental and natural resource challenges that face President Obama, a large one has received scant attention from environmental scholars: coal. In the environmental community, coal--dirty, polluting coal--is more of an epithet than a resource. It has been the bane of environmentalists since the early days of the Clean Air Act, (1) and its reputation has only gotten worse with the recognition that carbon dioxide (C[O.sub.2]), a major cause of climate change, is produced by coal at a higher ratio per energy output than other fossil fuels) Many environmental organizations propose eliminating coal entirely from our energy mix. (3) However, coal represents forty-nine percent of the Unites States' existing electric-generating capacity, and will likely remain an important source of energy in the near and intermediate term. (4) Even more importantly, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that fossil fuels (primarily coal) will dominate world energy until at least the middle of the next century. (5) Of particular concern is the fact that China, the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs), (6) depends heavily on coal-fired generation, and has relatively more coal than other energy sources to exploit in its continued meteoric growth. (7) Additionally, in the absence of federal policy on controlling GHGs, much uncertainty surrounds whether and to what extent coal-fired generation can be permitted at all. There have been many instances of state utility regulators, legislators, and governors vetoing the permitting of new coal-fired electricity generating facilities; (8) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) appeals board recently denied a permit for a new coal-fired plant because the permitting region, Region 8, had not set out a reasoned opinion on whether C[O.sub.2] is a \"pollutant subject to regulation\" under the Clean Air Act. (9) While these rejections of coal-fired power may be appropriate responses to the linkage between coal-fired power and GHG production, without being a part of a larger energy plan, they may lead to energy shortages and other unintended consequences. According to the International Energy Agency's 2008 Energy Technology Perspectives Executive Summary, coal will continue to be part of a future energy mix, and carbon capture and storage will generate approximately nineteen percent of the GHG reductions necessary to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide at 450 parts per million (ppm). (10) Therefore, it will be imperative for President Obama to figure out what role coal will play in our nation's future energy mix, and what role coal will have in other countries, since coal will continue to impact worldwide emissions of GHGs. Given the \"Scylla\" of increasing GHGs and the \"Charybdis\" (11) of the need to replace almost half of the United States' and the world's energy production if coal is banned, it is imperative that the United States move toward either reducing coal usage as quickly as possible around the world by ramping up other cost-effective energy sources, or figuring out a way to continue to produce coal-based electric power while drastically reducing GHG emissions. The option that has received the most attention is the latter, particularly in finding a way to sequester the carbon dioxide produced by coal-fired emissions and prevent it from entering the atmosphere and contributing to increasing GHGs. This process, referred to as carbon capture and storage (CCS), can potentially remove eighty to ninety-five percent of the C[O.sub.2] emitted from electric power plants. (12) Though C[O.sub.2] is routinely injected underground to aid in recovery of oil, and though large-scale underground sequestration sites have been identified in the United States, (13) there is not yet a commercial-scale C[O.sub.2] sequestration facility attached to a large coal-fired power plant. (14) Therefore, most of the research on this issue has focused on the technical and economic difficulties of cost effective CCS. \u2026", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "4512a2402c9c446a515c81db4258ce67b7801164", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2593167938", "CorpusId": 114734450}, "title": "Modeling low emission scenarios for the European power sector", "abstract": "The long-term ambition for the European power sector is to almost completely decarbonize generation of electricity. There are potentially many ways of achieving this, however, assessing an optimal transition to a low-carbon power system requires the use of advanced modeling tools. This thesis presents a collection of papers addressing various topics related to capacity expansion modeling of the European power system. The aim of the modeling is to evaluate cost-efficient decarbonization strategies. The most significant contribution of this work is the development of the European Model for Power system Investments (with high shares of) Renewable Energy, EMPIRE. This is a multi-horizon stochastic programming model where investments are optimized subject to operational uncertainty. The model simultaneously considers long-term and short-term system dynamics, in addition to short-term operational uncertainty. Inclusion of all these features is currently not used by any other capacity expansion model for the European power sector. The papers presented here focus on the formulation and applications of EMPIRE. Essentially all the papers touch upon analysis of decarbonization pathways for the European power sector. In addition, the role of carbon capture and storage (CCS) for decarbonizing the European power sector is analyzed in one paper. In the same paper, an evaluation of support mechanisms for enabling investments in demonstration CCS projects is presented. Another topic covered is integration of global climate change mitigation strategies computed by an integrated assessment model (IAM) in a study of the European power sector. This is handled through soft-linking of the IAM called GCAM and EMPIRE. By linking top-down and bottom-up models in this way, added detail can be provided to the IAM results. One paper presents a study where capacity factors from EMPIRE are used in life cycle assessment of electricity generation technologies in Europe. Improved estimations of utilization of different generation technologies can make the LCA impact analysis more accurate. In addition to the aforementioned topics, the thesis presents a contribution to the development of convergence improvements for the Benders decomposition method applied to large-scale power system investment planning problems. Also, a technique for improved handling of seasonal storage in power system capacity expansion models is discussed. The modeling studies show that large-scale deployment of wind power and carbon-capture and storage is the most cost-efficient approach to decarbonize the European power sector. Intermittent power generation should be built where the production potential is highest, and the transmission system should be reinforced to be able to balance large fluctuations in renewable production. If the transmission system is not developed, CCS becomes more important in the decarbonization as less wind power can be deployed. In order to secure investments in demonstration CCS plants financial support policies are needed. Investments in solar PV are limited in these studies, suggesting that additional cost reductions are needed for the technology to become competitive without support policies.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "5d158be67a186b057d9e8da0cb344c4cdc77049f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3178332065", "DOI": "10.46690/ager.2021.03.04", "CorpusId": 237686474}, "title": "Greenhouse gas sources and mitigation strategies from a geosciences perspective", "abstract": "Certain gases that are capable of trapping heat in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere are known as \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d and are important for helping to regulate temperature. Major greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, chloro\ufb02uorocarbons, and nitrous oxide. Burning fossil fuels produces carbon dioxide as a combustion product and atmospheric concentrations have increased dramatically over the past two centuries. The heat trapped by this additional greenhouse gas is changing climates, melting ice sheets and glaciers in polar regions, raising sea levels, and affecting ocean currents. Climate change can be mitigated by preventing the emission of additional fossil fuel combustion products to the atmosphere and reducing existing greenhouse gas levels back to pre-industrial revolution concentrations. This requires switching energy production to sustainable, non-fossil sources and applying carbon capture, use, and storage technology on the fossil fuel combustion that remains. The implementation of direct air capture technology to reduce existing carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere can further remediate climate impacts. Captured carbon dioxide can be stored in plant tissues, soils, deep underground in geological repositories, or as solid materials like concrete or carbonates to keep it from re-entering the atmosphere. Although non-carbon energy sources have recently become more cost-competitive with fossil energy, technological advancements and government policies are still needed to overcome the inherent economic advantages of fossil fuels. A global strategy must be developed to convince people that the higher cost of clean, sustainable energy is a price worth paying to replace fossil fuels and prevent a major environmental calamity.

Understanding the aqueous solubility of organic compounds related to these operations is important for water treatment and reuse alternatives, as well as risk assessment purposes. The well-established Setschenow equation can be used to determine the effect of salts on aqueous solubility. However, there is a lack of reported Setschenow constants, especially for polar organic compounds. In this study, the Setschenow constants for selected hydrophilic organic compounds were experimentally determined, and linear free energy models for predicting the Setschenow constant of organic chemicals in concentrated brines were developed. Solid phase microextraction was employed to measure the salting-out behavior of six selected hydrophilic compounds up to 5 M NaCl and 2 M CaCl2 and in Na-Ca-Cl brines. All compounds, which include phenol, p-cresol, hydroquinone, pyrrole, hexanoic acid, and 9-hydroxyfluorene, exhibited log-linear behavior up to these concentrations, meaning Setschenow constants previously measured at low salt concentrations can be extrapolated up to high salt concentrations for hydrophilic compounds. Setschenow constants measured in NaCl and CaCl2 brines are additive for the compounds measured here; meaning Setschenow constants measured in single salt solutions can be used in multiple salt solutions. The hydrophilic compounds in this study were selected to elucidate differences in salting-out behavior based on their chemical structure. Using data from this study, as well as literature data, linear free energy relationships (LFERs) for prediction of NaCl, CaCl2, LiCl, and NaBr Setschenow constants were developed and validated. Two LFERs were improved. One LFER uses the Abraham solvation parameters, which include the index of refraction of the organic compound, organic compound's polarizability, hydrogen bonding acidity and basicity of the organic compound, and the molar volume of the compound. The other uses an octanol-water partitioning coefficient to predict NaCl Setschenow constants. Improved models from this study now include organic compounds that are structurally and chemically more diverse than the previous models. The CaCl2, LiCl, and NaBr single parameter LFERs use concepts from the Hofmeister series to predict new, respective Setschenow constants from NaCl Setschenow constants. The Setschenow constants determined here, as well as the LFERs developed, can be incorporated into CCUS reactive transport models to predict aqueous solubility and partitioning coefficients of organic compounds.

Defect physics and rheophysics are integrated with nematodynamics and specific mechanisms of defect nucleation and annihilation are used to derive texture scale power laws. The integrated nematodynamics models specialized to carbonaceous mesophases are used to analyze: (i) linear and nonlinear viscoelasticity, (ii) rheological flows, and (iii) carbon fiber and flow-induced textures. The linear and nonlinear viscoelasticity reveals the essential nature of these materials : coupling between flow-induced orientation and orientationinduced flow, elastic storage through orientation gradients, and anisotropy. The rheological flow simulations, shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental data, reveal several liquid crystal specific rheological characteristics including shear thinning due to anisotropic viscosities and flow-induced orientation, and negative first normal stress difference due to orientation nonlinearities in the shear stress. Nematodynamic predictions are shown to follows a Carreau-Yasuda liquid crystal equation. Nematodynamics predictions rationalize shear-induced texture refinement in terms of defect nucleation and coarsening mechanisms and are used to derive texture scaling relations in terms of macroscopic, molecular, and flow time scales.

This tool builds upon the existing NatCarb database as well as supplemental geological information to address scale up potential for carbon dioxide storage within these formations. The focus of the assessment model is to specifically address the question, 'Where are opportunities to couple CO{sub 2} storage and extracted water use for existing and expanding power plants, and what are the economic impacts of these systems relative to traditional power systems?' Initial findings indicate that approximately less than 20% of all the existing complete saline formation well data points meet the working criteria for combined CO{sub 2} storage and extracted water treatment systems. The initial results of the analysis indicate that less than 20% of all the existing complete saline formation well data may meet the working depth, salinity and formation intersecting criteria. These results were taken from examining updated NatCarb data. This finding, while just an initial result, suggests that the combined use of saline formations for CO{sub 2} storage and extracted watermore\u00a0\u00bb use may be limited by the selection criteria chosen. A second preliminary finding of the analysis suggests that some of the necessary data required for this analysis is not present in all of the NatCarb records. This type of analysis represents the beginning of the larger, in depth study for all existing coal and natural gas power plants and saline formations in the U.S. for the purpose of potential CO{sub 2} storage and water reuse for supplemental cooling. Additionally, this allows for potential policy insight when understanding the difficult nature of combined potential institutional (regulatory) and physical (engineered geological sequestration and extracted water system) constraints across the United States. Finally, a representative scenario for a 1,800 MW subcritical coal fired power plant (amongst other types including supercritical coal, integrated gasification combined cycle, natural gas turbine and natural gas combined cycle) can look to existing and new carbon capture, transportation, compression and sequestration technologies along with a suite of extracting and treating technologies for water to assess the system's overall physical and economic viability. Thus, this particular plant, with 90% capture, will reduce the net emissions of CO{sub 2} (original less the amount of energy and hence CO{sub 2} emissions required to power the carbon capture water treatment systems) less than 90%, and its water demands will increase by approximately 50%. These systems may increase the plant's LCOE by approximately 50% or more. This representative example suggests that scaling up these CO{sub 2} capture and sequestration technologies to many plants throughout the country could increase the water demands substantially at the regional, and possibly national level.

This dissertation focuses on the design and analysis of key properties of VANETs and traffic control and monitoring applications enabled by aforementioned new technologies. \nAs simulation is the predominant tool used in research related to VANET, this dissertation first presents the key requirements for accurate simulations that arise from the various applications supported by VANETs. We then review the current state-of the-art of VANET simulation tools. Based on our analysis of the traditional simulation approaches, we present VGSim (\u2018V\u2019ehicular-based networking \u2018G\u2019rid \u2018SIM\u2019ulator), an integrated networking and microscopic vehicular mobility simulation platform. VGSim provides full-fledged wireless network simulation with accurate traffic mobility model. These two components are tightly integrated and interact dynamically. We discuss the flexibility of VGSim in adopting different mobility models and also present simulation results that empirically validate a modified mobility model that accurately captures the mobility of highway traffic. We discuss how VANET applications can be easily modeled in VGSim and demonstrate that using two important applications, namely, Accident Alert and Variable Speed Limit. \nAnother property of VANET enabled vehicles is that they can form wireless ad hoc mesh networks (VMeshes) that are mobile, constantly changing both in size and the geographic area they cover. We next focus on how the VMeshes can be used to capture and retain certain transient information on the road within a given region of interest for a certain period of time, without any infrastructure support. This dissertation studies this \u201cstorage capability\u201d of VANET for highway and city traffic. Particularly, we study different properties (average life time and deletion time) of the VANET storage for both 1-D highway traffic and 2-D city wide traffic. Through theoretical and detailed simulation analysis driven by the realistic mobility trace observed in San Francisco Yellow Cabs, we find that the same system parameters (e.g., transmission range and the size of the region of interest) can have different impact on VANET storage properties under different mobility patterns. Particularly, the size of the region of interest where the information needs to be stored has a large impact on the lifetime of the storage for the 2-D city-wide traffic. On the other hand, the transmission range of wireless communication has large impact on the success rate of deleting the information and the mean time to delete the information. Furthermore, the simulation analysis using SF Cab trace shows that even with low density of cabs, the average life time of VANET storage can be in order of minutes, demonstrating that it is possible to build realistic applications using VANET storage. \nGiven the on-going discussion of climate change and the ever increasing demand for fossil fuel, the ability to reduce vehicular carbon footprint is of great importance for both environmental and economical reasons. This dissertation next presents a Carbon Footprint/Fuel Consumption Aware Variable Speed Limit (FC-VSL) traffic control scheme that targets to minimize average vehicular fuel consumption on freeways, under live traffic conditions. We first formulate the problem of minimizing fuel consumption for a single vehicle under certain traffic condition as an optimal control problem. By solving the problem, we obtain the optimal vehicular trajectory that results in minimum fuel consumption. Then we design the FC-VSL scheme based on the optimal trajectory. We present the performance of the FC-VSL scheme through detailed simulation analysis.

Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) is one possible alternative to reduce the gap between supply and demand by storing the energy converted to hydrogen as a carrier and store it during surplus to produce it during high demand periods.

There is a lack of experience associated with this technology and only a small number of projects worldwide. There are several mechanisms that can compromise the integrity of the well and generate leakage of the stored gas. This paper aims to introduce the challenges associated with well integrity of UHS.

Recent experimental data reveals the impact of pressure, temperature, and salinity on interfacial tension (IFT) between CO2 and brine. The dependence of CO2-brine relative permeability and capillary pressure on IFT is also clearly evident in published experimental results. Improved understanding of the mechanisms that control the migration and trapping of CO2 in subsurface is crucial to design future storage projects that warrant long term and safe containment. Simulation studies ignoring the variation in interfacial tension and its effect on petrophysical properties of trapped CO2 saturations, relative permeability and capillary pressure have a poor chance of making accurate predictions of CO2 injectivity and its migration. We have developed and implemented a general relative permeability model that combines effects of pressure gradient, buoyancy, and IFT in an Equation of State (EOS) compositional and parallel simulator. The significance of IFT variations on CO2 migration and trapping is assessed. Introduction Saline aquifers can provide vast and safe storage for carbon dioxide pending a proper understanding of the displacement mechanisms of CO2-brine binary system at insitu conditions (Bachu, 2003). These aquifers are widely distributed, have reasonable permeability and porosity values, and have good thickness with large storage capacity (Franklin and Orr, 2004). Geological carbon sequestration involves injecting the produced CO2 into subsurface formations and trapping it through many geological and chemical mechanisms. CO2 injection in subsurface invokes multiphase flow, fluid phase behavior, relative permeability, wettability, gravity and buoyancy, capillary pressure, and geochemical reactions. Several research groups have studied the interplay of the capillary, gravity, viscous forces, and other factors that may affect the trapping (Pruess et al., 2003; Bachu et al., 1994; House et al., 2003). Much experimental research is focused on interfacial tension of oil, water, and gas phases (Taha, 2010). Many achievements have been made to understand the subsurface interaction between CO2 and formation brine (Bachu, 2008; Gunter, et al., 2004; Kumar, et al., 2005). Based on these findings, the injected CO2 in saline aquifers could be characterized in following forms: dissolved in formation brine, trapped by capillary forces in the pore space as residual saturation, adsorbed on minerals by chemical trapping, and free phase that is mobile. However, because the chemical trapping is significant for CO2 sequestration only in geological time scale, it is sometimes neglected for short time behavior studies. The injectivity of CO2 into an aquifer is greatly affected by the relative permeability and interplay of capillary, gravity, and viscous forces. During injection into the aquifers, CO2 displaces formation water at the leading edge of the plume as a drainage process. On the other hand during post injection, the formation brine displaces CO2 at the trailing end as in an imbibition direction. Several hysteresis models have been developed to capture the saturation history dependent relative permeability and capillary pressure relationships (Doughty, 2007). Experimental results show the change in both drainage and imbibition capillary pressure and relative permeability as the results of variations in pressure and salinity and (Bennion and Bachu, 2006). In many simulation studies, relative permeabilities are, however, defined at the beginning of the simulation study and only the variations due to saturation is modeled and the changes of pressure, salinity, and temperature are typically ignored. With the exception of the simulators with hysteretic models, the residual CO2 saturation is also fixed for a given rock type. However, the residual saturation is affected by the interfacial tension between CO2 and water and many experimental results reveal that the IFT between CO2 and brine varies at different pressure, salinity, and temperature conditions (Hauser and Michaels, 1948; Liu et al., 2010; Bennion and Bachu 2008; Al-Abri and Amin, 2009). These results show that the IFT decreases with increasing pressure, and increases with increasing temperature and salinity.

By time-resolved in situ imaging of nanoscale mineral interfacial reactions, it is possible to clarify the mechanisms governing mineral-fluid reactions.In this Account, we present a concise summary of this topic that addresses a current challenge at the frontier of understanding mineral interfaces and their importance to a wide range of mineral re-equilibration processes in the presence of a fluid aqueous phase. We have used real-time nanoscale imaging of liquid-cell atomic force microscopy (AFM) to observe the in situ coupling of the dissolution-precipitation process, whereby the dissolution of a parent mineral phase is coupled at mineral interfaces with the precipitation of another product phase, chemically different from the parent. These nanoscale observations allow for the identification of dissolution and growth rates through systematically investigating various minerals, including calcite (CaCO3), siderite (FeCO3), cerussite (PbCO3), magnesite (MgCO3), dolomite (CaMg(CO3)2), brushite (CaHPO4\u00b72H2O), brucite (Mg(OH)2), portlandite (Ca(OH)2), and goethite (\u03b1-FeOOH), in various reacting aqueous fluids containing solution species, such as arsenic, phosphate, organo- or pyrophosphate, CO2, selenium, lead, cadmium, iron, chromium, and antimony. We detected the in situ replacement of these parent mineral phases by product phases, identified through a variety of analytical methods such as Raman spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and various X-ray techniques, as well as modeling by geochemical simulation using PHREEQC. As a consequence of the coupled processes, sequestration of toxic elements and hazardous species and inorganic and organic carbon, and limiting or promoting recovery of nutrients can be achieved at nano- and macroscopic scales.We also used in situ AFM to quantitatively measure the retreat rates of molecular steps and directly observe the morphology changes of dissolution etch pits on calcium phosphates in organic acid solutions present in most rhizosphere environments. By molecular modeling using density functional theory (DFT), we explain the origin of dissolution etch pit evolution through specific stereochemistry and molecular recognition and provide an energetic basis by calculating the binding energies of chemical functionalities on organic acids to direction-specific steps on mineral surfaces. In addition, we further quantified precipitation kinetics of calcium phosphates (Ca-P's) on typical mineral surfaces at the nanoscale in environmentally relevant solutions with various organic molecules, by measurements obtained from sequential images obtained by liquid-cell AFM. In situ dynamic force spectroscopy (DFS) was used to determine binding energies of single-molecules with different chemical functionalities found in natural organic matter at mineral-fluid interfaces. Quantifying molecular organo-mineral bonding or binding energies mechanistically explains phosphate precipitation and transformation. From DFS measurements, molecular-scale interactions of mineral-natural organic matter (DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides) associations were determined. With this powerful tool, single-molecule determinations of polysaccharide-amorphous iron oxide or hematite interactions provided the mechanistic origin of the phase- or facet-dependent adsorption.

The scale and frequency of these responses are forecasted to increase as levels of variable renewable energy sources become a larger part of the electricity supply. To respond to climate change concerns, it is also anticipated that the coal-fired power plants of the future will incorporate carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies. Therefore, it is important to understand the dynamic response of coal-plants with CCS. A variety of engineering studies have been published that investigate the energy penalty and design requirements for coalfired plant running at static power output and carbon capture rate of 90 percent; however, few of these studies explore the ability of the capture unit to respond to changes in load and capture rates. Noting that amine absorption is considered the most advanced near-term technological solution for carbon capture, this paper provides an analysis of the dynamics of a MEA capture unit. This analysis enables the evaluation of the ability of coal-fired CCS power plants to provide load following support at different ramp rates and at varying levels of capture. A dynamic kinetic model of an MEA capture plant was developed using Aspen Dynamics\u00ae. The model is used to determine the dynamic characteristics of the capture plant for load following by simulating various ramp rates of flue gas flow from the power plant to the capture unit. These results are used to determine the ability of the capture plant to control power output to the grid and the impact on performance parameters such as the capture rate and energy consumption. The results shown that the capture plant operates on similar time scales of a coal-fired power plant. The capture plant will not prohibit the ability of the coal plant to adjust output. Introduction Electricity generation from fossil-fuel power plants is one of the largest sources of carbon dioxide emisisons (IPCC 2005). To reduce the amount of emissions from these power plants, carbon capture and sequestration is seen as one of the most promising technology options. In particular, chemical absorption is the most widely studied and advanced subset of these technologies. To date, most studies have looked at the steady state, full load, 90% capture operation of the CCS unit (Freguia et al. 2003; Abu-Zahra et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2009). Current coal-fired power plants need to be able to ramp to respond to changes in electricity demand and prices. If CCS is integrated into the power plant, it is important to determine the ability to respond to the changes in the power plant that may potentially affect the capture operation. Studies investigating load balancing with increasing penetration of renewables show that traditional baseload generation will need to be able to respond to a wide range of operating conditions and ramp rates (IEA 2011; GE Energy 2010). In addition, the operation of a flexible carbon capture system may enhance plant operating economics in by reducing steam required for solvent regeneration (Cohen 2011). Understanding the dynamics of the capture system is important for the operation of the power plant. 2 CMTC CMTC-151075-PP Other papers have considered the part-load, steady state operation of the capture unit integrated with the power plant (Chalmers et al. 2007; Haines et al. 2009), but did not consider the dynamic changes of the capture unit while transitioning to part-load operation. While many studies have investigated individual process units, few have studied the dynamics of an integrated carbon capture system. Lawal et al. (2009) and Kvamsdal et al. (2009) focused on the dynamic modeling of the absorber unit and Ziaii et al. (2009) focused on optimizing the energy usage of a standalone stripper model. This paper considers the dynamic operation of an absorber/stripper post-combustion monoethanolamine (MEA) capture plant of a nominal 500 MWth coal-fired power plant and investigates the time scales and effects of how the capture plant responds to step changes in the various inputs for an integrated absorber/stripper capture model. The cycling of a coalplant is reflected in the changes in the flue gas flow to the capture plant, changes in the capture rate for environmental or economic reasons, and changes in the amount of available steam to the reboiler. This will help determine the deviations from set points and the ability to return to steady state. This study will look at the range of operational issues presented as the capture plant undergoes the changes that are typical to the operation of a coal-fired power plant. Description and Application of Equipment and Processes Process Description A steady-state model of an absorber/stripper post-combustion MEA capture unit was created in Aspen Plus Version 7.3 based on the work of Kothandaraman (2010). The steady-state model was used for model development and verification. The absorber and stripper were assumed to have 30 equilibrium stages and 20 equilibrium stages, respectively. The sizing of the columns was done to accommodate the flow from a nominal 500 MWth coal-fired power plant using only one absorber/stripper train. The major process components that were modeled are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Process flowsheet for absorber/stripper post-combustion capture process For this study, the electrolyte non-random two-liquid (ELECNRTL) property method was used. The absorber/stripper chemistry was represented with seven reactions. SO2 and NOx were assumed to be inert gases for the purposes of the model. H2O + MEA+ <--> MEA + H3O+ (1) 2 H2O <--> H3O+ OH(2) HCO3+ H2O <--> CO3-+ H3O+ (3) CO2 + OH<--> HCO3(4) HCO3--> CO2 + OH(5) MEA + CO2 + H2O --> MEACOO+ H3O+ (6) MEACOO+ H3O+ \uf0e0 MEA + CO2 + H2O (7) The dimensions of the absorber are 17 m in height and 12 m in diameter and the dimensions of the stripper are 15 m in height and 7 meters in diameter. The absorber and stripper pressure were set to 1 atm and 1.75 atm, respectively. The CMTC CMTC-151075-PP 3 condenser was modeled externally from the RadFrac column due to convergence issues, but his did not affect the results of the model. To achieve water and amine balance for the model due to process losses, the makeup was added in the surge tank. The water makeup was used to maintain to 30-wt% of the MEA solution, while the amine makeup was added primarily for model convergence. Temperature was maintained through the system of heat exchangers shown above. The lean solvent heat exchanger and the condenser were modeled to maintain a constant exit temperature, while the cross heat exchanger was modeled to allow for changes in process conditions allowing the exit temperatures to be free variables in the model. Dynamic Simulation and Control Strategy The steady-state model was exported to Aspen Dynamics and the flow-driven type model was chosen. Figure 2 illustrates the control structure of the post-combustion MEA capture. The primary objective of the system is to maintain a specified capture rate of 90%. To achieve this level of capture, the lean solvent circulation rate is manipulated. The capture rate is determined by measuring the incoming mass flow of CO2 to the absorber and the mass flow exiting the absorber through the vent stream. To control the lean solvent rate, the flow from the storage tank is manipulated. Figure 2. Absorber/stripper process flow diagram with control structure The lean solvent loading is one of the key parameters in CO2 capture. To regenerate the rich solvent from the absorber, heat is applied in the form of steam to the reboiler to drive off the CO2 from solution, resulting in an energy intensive process. The amount of reboiler duty drives the equilibrium of the lean solvent at the fixed pressure of the column. From the steady-state simulations, it was determined that the energetic optimum for the lean concentration is 0.20 on a dry molar basis. The study by Panahi et al. (2011) stated that a proper indicator for lean loading is the column stage temperature. A direct measurement of the lean loading would be costly and time intensive. The reboiler temperature was maintained at a temperature of 124\u00b0C to achieve the desired lean loading. For the purposes of the model, the steam temperature and pressure were assumed to be constant throughout the operating range. This paper does not consider the issue of steam extraction from the crossover piping of the steam turbine. Given the arrangement of the turbine system, the steam may deviate from full load temperature and pressure at different operating conditions. The other process controls were used to control the operating pressure and sump level of the absorber and stripper. To maintain the operating level of the columns, the gas flow exiting the column was manipulated. To maintain the sump level of the columns, the liquid flow was manipulated. The heat exchangers were modeled as instantaneous processes. Presentation of Data and Results Three disturbances were tested using the dynamic simulation. These disturbances were used to determine the dynamic behavior of the process variables, the response time of the system and time to achieve steady state, and the performance of the system in the new steady state. The three disturbances were to the flue gas flow rate to simulate a change in plant load, a 4 CMTC CMTC-151075-PP change in capture rate to simulate flexible operation for economic reasons, and a change in the reboiler temperature to decrease steam extraction from the turbine and increase power output. Disturbance to flue gas flow To analyze the dynamics of the system for a change in fuel consumption by the base coal plant, a negative 10% step change was made to the incoming flue gas flow, steady state was achieved again, and a positive 10% step change was made to return to the original inputs to the capture plant. The system was run for 2 hours before the", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "f0cfeb62c1c7f85644060d6537f5302ef30b4d2d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2224394627", "CorpusId": 110962163}, "title": "Goal-oriented inference : theoretical foundations and application to carbon capture and storage", "abstract": "Many important engineering problems require\ncomputation of prediction output quantities of interest that depend\non unknown distributed parameters of the governing partial\ndifferential equations.

This need forces to collect data to validate model(s) to asses the carbon dioxide release (area of interest and consequences) in case of an unlike event of pipeline leak or rupture; -Operational, that is how to avoid hydrate formation. All these issues are strongly related on actual CO2 composition due to the presence of impurities as H2S, CO, Amine, O2, N2 etc. The approach is to deepen the knowledge by perform comprehensive state of the art reviews, later on accompanied by mid scale testing to get the feeling of a real CO2 pipeline behaviour prior to perform full scale testing (highly cost impacting and never performed before) which is the final and necessary step.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "e9671e7bc5ce6d1faffa5557865fd7e977a967ee", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2895462880", "DOI": "10.3390/EN11102627", "CorpusId": 116026383}, "title": "Thermodynamic Modeling of CO2-N2-O2-Brine-Carbonates in Conditions from Surface to High Temperature and Pressure", "abstract": "Nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2) are important impurities obtained from carbon dioxide (CO2) capture procedures.

Numerous factors are important in determining the overall effectiveness of long-term geologic storage of carbon, including leakage rates, volume of storage available, and system costs. Recent efforts have been made to apply an existing probabilistic performance assessment (PA) methodology developed for deep nuclear waste geologic repositories to evaluate the effectiveness of subsurface carbon storage (Viswanathan et al., 2008; Stauffer et al., 2009). However, to address the most pressing management, regulatory, and scientific concerns with subsurface carbon storage (CS), the existing PA methodology and tools must be enhanced and upgraded. For example, in the evaluation of a nuclear waste repository, a PA model is essentially a forward model that samples input parameters and runs multiple realizations to estimate future consequences and determine important parameters driving the system performance. In the CS evaluation, however, a PA model must be able to run both forward and inverse calculations to support optimization of CO{sub 2} injection and real-time site monitoring as an integral part of the system design and operation. The monitoring data must be continually fused into the PA model through model inversion and parameter estimation. Model calculations more\u00a0\u00bb will in turn guide the design of optimal monitoring and carbon-injection strategies (e.g., in terms of monitoring techniques, locations, and time intervals). Under the support of Laboratory-Directed Research & Development (LDRD), a late-start LDRD project was initiated in June of Fiscal Year 2010 to explore the concept of an enhanced performance assessment system (EPAS) for carbon sequestration and storage. In spite of the tight time constraints, significant progress has been made on the project: (1) Following the general PA methodology, a preliminary Feature, Event, and Process (FEP) analysis was performed for a hypothetical CS system. Through this FEP analysis, relevant scenarios for CO{sub 2} release were defined. (2) A prototype of EPAS was developed by wrapping an existing multi-phase, multi-component reservoir simulator (TOUGH2) with an uncertainty quantification and optimization code (DAKOTA). (3) For demonstration, a probabilistic PA analysis was successfully performed for a hypothetical CS system based on an existing project in a brine-bearing sandstone. The work lays the foundation for the development of a new generation of PA tools for effective management of CS activities. At a top-level, the work supports energy security and climate change/adaptation by furthering the capability to effectively manage proposed carbon capture and sequestration activities (both research and development as well as operational), and it greatly enhances the technical capability to address this national problem. The next phase of the work will include (1) full capability demonstration of the EPAS, especially for data fusion, carbon storage system optimization, and process optimization of CO{sub 2} injection, and (2) application of the EPAS to actual carbon storage systems. \u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "d9dea1ffe7b5285b29fb03d0292db594f3634010", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 202120288}, "title": "Development of CCS ( Carbon Capture and Storage ) Technology to Combat Climate Change \u2014 Advancement of Environmentally Conscious Clean Coal Power Plant Technologies", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION COMBATTING climate change has become an important issue as energy demand expands along with worldwide economic growth. Coal-fired thermal power plants play an important role as a key source of energy in many countries because the coal is cheap and coal reserves are extensive and geographically widespread rather than being concentrated in particular areas. A problem with coal, however, is that it emits a large quantity of CO2 (carbon dioxide) per unit of output and this has created a strong demand for the development of CCS technologies that can separate out and capture the CO2 as a new approach that can help move toward a low-carbon society. Hitachi is working to achieve the practical realization of CCS based on the various environmental technologies that it has built up over time.

The scenario analysis shows that, without any explicit abatement efforts, energy-related carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions are estimated to double by the middle of this century compared with the year 2000. With CO 2 abatement measures being equivalent to a CO 2 price of up to $100/t in 2050, CO 2 emissions can be reduced by 23% relative to levels in 2000. Further efforts to halve CO 2 emissions in 2050 relative to 2000 levels can be achieved in a future energy system characterized (besides efficiency improvements and increased use of renewables, especially biomass) by an almost entirely decarbonized power generation sector (through carbon capture and storage power plants, renewable technologies and nuclear power), which provides electricity as the major final energy carrier to the end-use sectors.

Risks to benthic marine life following possible leakage of gas through the seabed from this carbon capture and storage (CCS) initiative are not yet well established. This study examined behavior (activity patterns) in brown shrimp (Crangon crangon), exposed to a range of reduced seawater pH conditions (7.6, 7, or 6.5) simulating leakage scenarios of varying scales. Brown shrimp have an endogenous rhythmicity associated with their activity, which dictates they are most active during hours of darkness, presumably as protection against vision-dependent predators. This endogenous rhythm in activity continues to be expressed when shrimp are held under constant low-light conditions in the lab and provides an ecologically relevant endpoint to measure when examining the influence of reduced pH on the behavior of these animals. No marked differences in activity pattern were observed between control shrimp maintained at pH 8.1 and those at pH 7.6. However, changes in activity were evident at pH 7 and pH 6.5, where significant shifts in timing and intensity of activity occurred. There was an unexpected increase in activity within periods of expected light, probably signaling efforts by shrimp to migrate away from reduced seawater pH conditions.

In the proposed cycles, the gas turbine flue gases are used as cathode feeding for a MCFC, where CO2 is transferred from the cathode to anode side, concentrating the CO2 in the anode exhaust. At the anode side the MCFCs are fed with natural gas, processed by an external reformer which is thermally integrated within the FC module; the corresponding CO2 production is completely concentrated at the anode. The resulting anode exhaust stream is then sent to a CO2 removal section which is based on a cryogenic CO2 removal process, based on internal or external refrigeration cycles, cooling the exhaust stream in the heat recovery steam generator, and recycling residual fuel compounds to the power cycle. In all cases, a high purity CO2 stream is obtained after condensation of water and pumped in liquid form for subsequent storage. It is investigated the possibility to arrange the MCFC section with different configurations and operating parameters of the fuel cell modules, and the option to include two fuel cell modules in series connection, with intermediate cooling of the cathode stream, in order to enhance the plant CO2 separation effectiveness.

Carbon storage in underground geological formations is one of the applicable approaches of CCS. The main concern for a geologic carbon dioxide (CO2) sequestration is sustained confinement of the injected CO2 over long time periods (hundreds of years). For selection of the proper underground storage site, monitoring the CO2 plume movement and predicting the behavior of the reservoir pressure (indicator of potential leakage in the system), it is essential to use an appropriate multiphase flow dynamic reservoir model. The Numerical Reservoir Simulator is the most appropriate tool for accomplishing this task. Data collected from an ongoing saline storage pilot, Citronelle Dome, located in Mobile County (Alabama, US), was considered for this study. This project is a part of a CO2 storage research project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and conducted by the Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership, which is primarily comprised of the Southern States Energy Board, Electric Power Research Institute, Southern Company, Advanced Resources International and Denbury Offshore, to demonstrate commercial-scale storage of CO2 captured from an existing coal-fired power plant. A commercial reservoir simulation model (CMG\u2019s GEM) for CO2 sequestration at the Citronelle Dome was developed. The model is based on a comprehensive geological study that included data from more than 40 well logs. The presence of PDGs (Pressure Down-hole Gauge) was considered in the reservoir model at the observation well. Relative permeability curves, hysteresis, rock type, vertical permeability, boundary condition and brine density as well as compressibility are several uncertain variables for multiple reservoir simulations and parametric studies. 500 years is the time frame of interest for assessing the effect of each parameter (within a typical range) on the CO2 plume extension and reservoir pressure behavior (in observation well). The results are analyzed to investigate the uncertainty of CO2 behavior and risk of leakage. Also this analysis provides a framework to be used for history matching the reservoir model in presence of actual field data (real time pressure from observation well).", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "019ccbdbcd88bb5de7e94de66abc3b376c902fa2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2924401309", "DOI": "10.1007/s11056-019-09714-z", "CorpusId": 85527821}, "title": "Impact of timber harvesting on carbon storage in montane forests of central Mexico", "abstract": "Cut stumps are the legacy of forest harvesting and allow for the estimation of carbon loss from the ecosystem.

We used historical aerial photography and satellite imagery to study changes in tree canopy cover in the southern Tasmanian Midlands, one of the oldest agricultural regions in Australia. Tree cover at 1,000 random sites was assessed from imagery captured on four occasions between 1947 and 2010.

The decrease appeared driven by transition from some cover to no cover, rather than from more cover to less cover, because sites with tree cover in 2010 showed little net change during the study period. Statistical modelling showed soils derived from igneous rocks lost more cover than did the less fertile sedimentary soils, and contrary to the expectations, if drought was the cause of cover loss, sun-exposed north-facing sites did not lose more cover than south-facing ones.

The process is unique in that around two-thirds of the direct CO2 emissions are unavoidable as they come from the process chemistry rather than from fuel combustion. This makes reducing them particularly difficult, and carbon capture and storage is currently the only option that can reduce emissions by the extent required to allow cement manufacture to continue beyond the transition to low CO2-emission economies. Post-combustion capture options, which are similar to those described in Chapter 4, are available. Equally, oxy-fuel combustion is possible. Pre-combustion capture can only deal with one-third of emissions from combustion, and so is generally not considered. Other cement-specific options exist, such as direct separation, and the synergies between calcium looping and cement manufacture are noteworthy. High CO2 intensity coupled with the relatively low price of cement means that CCS is expensive per unit of cement manufactured. The lack of large-scale capture facilities means that the costs are rather uncertain, although several estimates are given in this chapter.

Our study allowed a certain hierarchy of criteria to be identified for the comparative assessment. We discovered that the physical state for transport (fluid for CO2 and solid for radioactive waste) and the volumes involved are the key properties for determining the most suitable modes of transport. These are pipelines (on- and offshore) for liquid or supercritical CO2, and rail, ship or truck for spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste.

Authigenic minerals include quartz overgrowth, dawsonite (5\u201315 vol%), calcite, ferrocalcite and ankerite. The major rock types are medium- to fine-grained arkose, feldspathic litharenite and lithic arkose. Quantitative analysis suggests that the burial depth and feldspar content are the two dominant controlling factors of the growth of dawsonite. The dawsonite content increases initially before decreasing with burial depth, with the peak dawsonite content occurring at approximately 1500 m depth. This trend is probably due to increases in temperature and pCO2 with the burial depth and contributes to the formation of dawsonite. However, the pCO2 content and stability of dawsonite decrease with increasing distance from the centre of the gas reservoir. When the formation temperature exceeds the upper limit of the preservation temperature of dawsonite, the dawsonite is suppressed, while the dissolution of dawsonite is promoted. Overall, the dawsonite content exhibits a positive correlation with the feldspar content. The dissolution of feldspar makes both Na+ and Al3+ available and creates the accommodation space necessary for dawsonite growth. In addition, feldspar dissolution also neutralises the acidity of the thermal fluid present, which again facilitates the growth and preservation of the dawsonite.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "dceb2fcfc66db15a5752a0f6de0dbe3b73d4ea10", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2912299100", "PubMedCentral": "6349027", "DOI": "10.7717/peerj.6311", "CorpusId": 59413475, "PubMed": "30701135"}, "title": "Impact assessment of high soil CO2 on plant growth and soil environment: a greenhouse study", "abstract": "To ensure the safety of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, insight into the potential impacts of CO2 leakage on the ecosystem is necessary.

In CCS, greenhouse gases such as CO2 that are emitted from stacks are isolated in underground geological storage. Natural analogue studies that can provide insights into possible geological CO2 storage sites, can deliver crucial information about the safety and security of geological sequestration, the long-term impact of CO2 storage on the environment, and the field operation and monitoring requirements for geological sequestration. This study adopted a probability density function (PDF) approach for CO2 leakage monitoring by characterizing naturally occurring CO2-rich groundwater as an analogue that can occur around a CO2 storage site due to CO2 dissolving into fresh groundwater. Two quantitative indices, (QItail and QIshift), were estimated from the PDF test and were used to compare CO2-rich and ordinary groundwaters.

Specifically, the country must reduce its total GHG emissions by 30% compared to business-as-usual (BAU) by 2020. This study has two main purposes. First, the study aims to measure the economic impacts of pursuing and achieving the government\u2019s GHG reduction targets. Second, it aims to estimate each major policy\u2019s potential GHG emission reductions in the various sectors. We use the computable general equilibrium model and develop three scenarios to examine the economic and environmental impacts of Korea\u2019s green growth policies \u2013 a baseline scenario wherein the national economy proceeds without green growth policies; scenario A, wherein the government imposes national and sectoral emission reduction targets without adopting green technologies; and scenario B, wherein the government adopts policy and technology as renewable portfolio standard and carbon capture and storage. The simulation results from scenario A indicate that the government\u2019s mid-term targets could pose a significant challenge to Korea\u2019s national economy.

Enhancing the solubility of CO2 in formation water has always been the focus of research in the area of CO2 sequestration. Ultrasound techniques are one of the environmentally friendly methods that use high-intensity acoustic waves to improve gas solubility in liquids. Ultrasonic waves can alter the properties of different phases that lead to chemical reactions and provide a means to increase the solubility of CO2 in connate water. In this study, we investigated the effects of ultrasound on the solubility of CO2 in connate water under different conditions of pressure, temperature, and salinity. The results showed that the solubility of CO2 was improved with increasing pressure under ultrasonic effects. However, the solubility of CO2 was inversely proportional to the increase in brine salinity and temperature. Therefore, it was concluded that the solubility of CO2 might be enhanced in the presence of ultrasound.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "43337b7e0f3066ef3e86a9549e315bd8d218d8a3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2227864158", "DOI": "10.1007/S40095-015-0193-X", "CorpusId": 101542701}, "title": "Pilot tests of CO2 capture in brick production industry using gas\u2013liquid contact membranes", "abstract": "It is generally accepted that carbon capture and storage strategies will play a crucial role for mitigating CO2 emissions at short- and mid-term scenarios.

The SiteChar project funded by 7 th Framework Programme of European Commission gives the opportunity to evaluate the most influential parameters of techno-economic evaluations of four feasible European projects for CO2 geological storage located onshore and offshore and related to aquifer storage or oil and gas reservoirs, at different stages of characterization. Four potential CO2 storage sites have been assessed in terms of storage costs per tonne of CO2 permanently stored (equivalent cost based). They are located offshore UK, onshore Denmark, offshore Norway and offshore Italy. The four SiteChar techno-economic evaluations confirm it is not possible to derive any meaningful average cost for a CO2 storage site. The results demonstrate that the structure of costs for a project is heterogeneous and the storage cost is consequently site dependent. The strategy of the site development is fundamental, the technical choices such as the timing, rate and duration of injection are also important. The way monitoring is managed, using observation wells and logging has a strong impact on the estimated monitoring costs. Options to lower monitoring costs, such as permanent surveys, exist and should be further investigated. Table 1 below summarizes the cost range in Euro per tonne (Discount Rate (DR) at 8%) for the different sites, which illustrates the various orders of magnitude due to the specificities of each site. These figures have how to be considered with care. In particular the Italian and Norwegian sites present very specific features that explain the high estimated costs. For the Italian site, the short duration of CO2 injection associated with a low injection rate makes the CO2 project comparable to a demo project. The Norwegian site is an offshore site located in a virgin area with high infrastructure costs and a combination of injection duration and injection rate that makes the derived costs very sensitive to the discount rate.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "9547fee876fbf6d470916ac1d4265dac394d085f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2185833549", "CorpusId": 129985743}, "title": "Influence of cooling and heating rate on CO2 condensation and evaporation observed in a saturated synthetic rock sample", "abstract": "Summary The possibility of reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into atmosphere by capture and storage into subsurface reservoirs has led to many different studies related to seismic monitoring of geologically stored carbon to aid in the interpretation of field seismic observations, simultaneous ultrasonic measurements of wave velocities are being conducted on a variety of porous materials.

The thermodynamic performance of these membrane-based plants are compared with similar IGCCs that capture CO2 using conventional (i.e. solvent absorption) technology. The basic plant configuration employs an entrained-flow, oxygen-blown coal gasifier with quench cooling, followed by an adiabatic water gas shift (WGS) reactor that converts most of CO contained in the syngas into CO2 and H2 . The syngas then enters a WGS membrane reactor where the syngas undergoes further shifting; simultaneously, H2 in the syngas permeates through the hydrogen-selective, dense metal membrane into a counter-current nitrogen \u201csweep\u201d flow. The permeated H2 , diluted by N2 , constitutes a decarbonized fuel for the combined cycle power plant whose exhaust is CO2 -free. Exiting the membrane reactor is a hot, high pressure \u201craffinate\u201d stream composed primarily of CO2 and steam, but also containing \u201cfuel species\u201d such as H2 S, unconverted CO, and unpermeated H2 . Two different schemes (oxygen catalytic combustion and cryogenic separation) have been investigated to both exploit the heating value of the fuel species and produce a CO2 -rich stream for long term storage. Our calculations indicate that, when 85%vol of the H2 +CO in the original syngas is extracted as H2 by the membrane reactor, the membrane-based IGCC systems are more efficient by \u223c1.7 percentage points than the reference IGCC with CO2 capture based on commercially ready technology.Copyright \u00a9 2005 by ASME", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "3b86bc77440f1cfe3cac8c380003d6dd76ed2448", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1983656458", "DOI": "10.2174/1874396X00802010089", "CorpusId": 14350901}, "title": "BLEVE: Theory and Importance in Oil Recovery", "abstract": "BLEVEs as phenomena are defined as extremely violent explosions that may occur when liquids and high- density fluids under pressure are subject to a failure in the containing vessel.

This R&D project (the Anthropogenic Test) is an integral component of a plan by Southern Company, and its subsidiary, Alabama Power, to demonstrate integrated CO2 capture, transport and storage technology originating at a an existing pulverized coal-fired power plant. The capture component of the test takes place at the James M. Barry Electric Generating Plant (Plant Barry) in Bucks, Alabama. The capture facility, equivalent to 25 MW, will utilize post-combustion amine capture technology licensed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries America. CO2 emissions captured at the plant will be transported by pipeline for underground storage in a deep, saline geologic formation within the Citronelle Dome, located in Mobile County, Alabama. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2011, up to 650 tonnes of CO2 per day will be captured and transported twelve miles by pipeline to the storage site for injection and subsurface storage. These transportation and injection operations will continue for two to three years. Subsurface monitoring will be deployed through 2017 in order to track plume movement in the deep subsurface and to monitor for leakage.
