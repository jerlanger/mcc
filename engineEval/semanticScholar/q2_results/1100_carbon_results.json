Herein, we report synthesis of six covalent organic polymers (COPs) and their CO2, N2, and CH4 adsorption performances at low and high pressures up to 200 bar.

Physical properties of the materials such as surface areas, pore volume and pore size were determined through BET analysis at 77 K. All the materials were tested for CO2, CH4, and N2 adsorption using state of the art equipment, magnetic suspension balance (MSB).

By deliberately integrating trees with crop-and animal-production systems, agroforestry systems offer a promising avenue for C storage and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in several of the managed terrestrial ecosystems around the world. Exploitation of mechanisms such as nutrient cycling, nitrogen fixation by tree legumes, and deep-capture of nutrients by deep-rooted tree components offers a distinct possibility for reducing agrochemical inputs to these systems, yet maintaining the system productivity at reasonable levels on a sustained basis. Furthermore, with the emphasis on fruit trees and other multipurpose trees that provide multiple products and services, the proportion of total photosynthates that is removed from the system is minimized, thereby facilitating storage of more C in the system than in conventional, clear-cut silvicultural systems. Examples of management opportunities in agroforestry for better C sequestration include adoption of \u201cgreen\u201d technologies such as return of biomass and plant residues to fields, providing vegetative barriers and canopy cover on soil surface to reduce soil erosion, and reclaiming degraded lands such as salt-affected and eroded soils through tree planting. The extent of and possibility for agroforestry vary in different parts of the world. Alley cropping and improved fallow systems are good examples of intensive biomassmanagement systems in the tropics, whereas shaded perennial and silvopastoral systems represent situations with permanent tree cover. The five recognized agroforestry systems in the temperate region-alley cropping, forest farming, riparian buffer, silvopasture, and windbreaks-vary greatly in their C storage potential. Although trees are good C sinks, the relationship between tree planting and C sequestration is not a simple one. Estimates of C sequestration from terrestrial ecosystems are based on models extrapolated from experimental data, monitoring of changes in atmospheric CO2, and remote sensing using satellite imagery to detect changes in land-use practices. Each of these methods has drawbacks. The situation is more complex in the case of agroforestry systems, on which neither reliable statistics on the extent of area, nor rigorous C sequestration data under filed conditions exist. Furthermore, while theoretical or experimental data are useful for predicting effects of agroforestry in C sequestration, economic realities are a major factor in determining actual as opposed to potential amounts stored. Thus, although agroforestry systems seem to have high potential for C sequestration, considerable effort is needed in realistically assessing the magnitude of this potential as well as realizing it.

CCS can be defined as the separation and capture of CO2 produced at large stationary sources, followed by transport and storage in geological reservoirs, the ocean or minerals in order to prevent its emission to the atmosphere. \n \nThe objective of this thesis is to assess the technical possibilities, costs and risks of CCS systems to allow comparison, identify promising options and determine how and to what extent CCS could be deployed over time in the Netherlands. \n \nIn the short term, electricity can be produced with strongly reduced CO2 emissions by means of pulverised coal-fired power plants and natural gas-fired combined cycles equipped with chemical absorption units, or integrated coal gasification combined cycles integrated with a shift reactor and a physical absorption unit. Electricity production costs and CO2 mitigation costs versus an identical plant without capture are calculated at 5-7 \u20acct/kWh and 15-50 \u20ac/t CO2. CO2 transport and storage in depleted gas fields or aquifers typically add another 0.1-1 /ct/kWh. In the longer term, the efficiencies could be improved with 30-40%, and mitigation costs could eventually be reduced to 10-40 \u20ac/t CO2. \nHydrogen can be produced by means of large-scale steam methane reforming or coal gasification with CO2 capture from the shifted syngas, or by means of decentralised membrane reformers. The latter technology, which has been studied using Aspenplus, promises economic small-scale hydrogen production and inexpensive CO2 separation. The additional costs to induce CCS at hydrogen plants is relatively low (5-20 \u20ac/t CO2). Nevertheless, electricity production with CCS generally deserves preference as CO2 mitigation option, as the costs to replace natural gas or gasoline for hydrogen are relatively high. \n \nCCS may play a significant role in decarbonising the Dutch energy and industrial sector, which currently emit nearly 100 Mt CO2/yr. We found that 15 Mt CO2 could be avoided annually by 2020, mainly by capturing CO2 from new coal-fired power plants. Halfway this century, the mitigation potential of CCS is estimated at 80-110 Mt CO2/yr, of which 60-80 Mt CO2/yr may be avoided at costs between 10 and 40 \u20ac/t CO2. The mitigation potential in the power sector has been estimated at 60-84 Mt CO2/yr by 2050, assuming electricity supply is doubled. Industrial sources add another 16 Mt CO2/yr. The development of a market for alternative fuels produced via syngas production with CCS creates an opportunity to decarbonise the transport sector. The reduction potential by 2050 has been estimated very roughly at 10 Mt CO2/yr for F-T diesel or H2 production with CCS. \n \nHowever, truly realising these potentials will require long-term climate policy and a clear and internationally oriented vision on the organisation of CCS deployment in the coming decades. In the Netherlands, gas fields seem the most appropriate reservoirs for CO2 storage given their large storage capacity. As many reservoirs will be abandoned before 2025, a strategy must be developed to assure sufficient storage capacity will be available in the spring of a potential CCS era. Not all reservoirs will be suited for CO2 storage due to an array of geological constraints, in particular the risk of CO2 leakage through abandoned wells, faults and fractures. Although the mechanisms of CO2 leakage are fairly well understood, quantifying leakage rates is still a challenge. In addition, underground gas storage may become a serious 'competitor' with underground CO2 storage, especially when the Netherlands becomes an international gas hub. When large CO2 reductions are required, we may have to rely on the Groningen gas field, or the mega reservoirs in the British or Norwegian part of the North Sea.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "9ef125dba25f588406f65e312a4532f5775c5e49", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2100605002", "DOI": "10.1002/ep.10590", "CorpusId": 55847860}, "title": "Environmental sustainability and climate change mitigation\u2014CCS technology, better having it than not having it at all!", "abstract": "Climate change is happening and already manifested in a range of ways, including: global warming, rising sea levels, floods, heat\u2010waves, stronger and more frequent storms, and droughts.

The article also focuses on various relevant facts and figures from the literature on CCS technology and explores various challenges that the technology may face in future. \u00a9 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Environ Prog, 2012", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "44890c21cb6db62f6c2e87345abffe825d966307", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2119351754", "DOI": "10.1016/J.APENERGY.2011.12.053", "CorpusId": 54941025}, "title": "Integrated assessment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the German power sector and comparison with the deployment of renewable energies", "abstract": null, "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "99b1c4b1b93a5098941f3be3c65c1f4b84ccc4db", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2018092416", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2012.05.007", "CorpusId": 95523076}, "title": "Dynamic simulation of pipelines containing dense phase/supercritical CO2-rich mixtures for carbon capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "7936198370f336cc4370f20e742a1379e8b63cfc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2019823467", "DOI": "10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2014.08.064", "CorpusId": 153718333}, "title": "Waste reduction algorithm applied for environmental impact assessment of coal gasification with carbon capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "4ddf5ca4f7a5694e5c63814775751711fe259bc2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2617613454", "DOI": "10.1002/2014EF000249", "CorpusId": 113642085}, "title": "BECCS capability of dedicated bioenergy crops under a future land\u2010use scenario targeting net negative carbon emissions", "abstract": "Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is a key component of mitigation strategies in future socioeconomic scenarios that aim to keep mean global temperature rise below 2\u00b0C above preindustrial, which would require net negative carbon emissions in the end of the 21st century.

Coal is the world\u2019s fastest growing fossil fuel. This trend presents a forceful case for the development and wide dissemination of technologies that can decouple coal consumption from CO2 emissions - the leading candidate technology to do this is carbon capture and storage (CCS). China simultaneously presents the most challenging and critical test for CCS deployment at scale. While China has begun an handful of marquee CCS demonstration projects, the stark reality to be explored in this paper is that China\u2019s incentives for keeping on the forefront of CCS technology learning do not translate into incentives to massively deploy CCS in power plant applications as CO2 mitigation scenarios would have it. In fact, fundamental and interrelated Chinese interests - in energy security, economic growth and development, and macroeconomic stability - directly argue against large-scale implementation of CCS in China unless such an implementation can be almost entirely supported by outside funding. This paper considers how these core Chinese goals play out in the specific context of the country\u2019s coal and power markets, and uses this analysis to draw conclusions about the path of CCS implementation in China\u2019s energy sector. Finally, the paper argues that effective climate change policy will require both the vigorous promotion and careful calculation of CCS\u2019s role in Chinese power generation. As the world approaches the end of the Kyoto Protocol in 2012 and crafts a new policy architecture for a global climate deal, international offset policy and potential US offset standards need to create methodologies that directly address CCS funding at scale. The more closely these policies are aligned with China\u2019s own incentives and the unique context of its coal and power markets, the better chance they have of realizing the optimal role for CCS in global climate efforts.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "999756e83efaca3d0b94c59b6837189d3614170f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2016059240", "DOI": "10.4155/cmt.12.11", "CorpusId": 17590943}, "title": "The potential of waste-to-energy in reducing GHG emissions", "abstract": "Background: The combustion of municipal solid waste (MSW) to generate heat or electricity (waste-to-energy [WTE]) could reduce net GHG emissions in the USA compared with combusting methane from landfills.

Furthermore, half of these sites lie within 20 km of potential underground saline and other CO2 storage reservoirs. We estimate that the levelized electricity cost for WTE without CO2 capture is US$94/MWh and is $285/MWh with amine-based post-combustion capture technology.

The US government uses values of $11, $33, and $52 per metric ton of CO2, classifying the middle value as the central figure and the two others for use in sensitivity analyses. Three other estimates using the same government model but lower discount rates put the figures at $62, $122, and $266/ton. In this article, we calculate, on a cents-per-kilowatt-hour basis, the environmental cost of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel generation and add it to production costs. With this, we compare the total social cost (generation plus environmental costs) of building new generation from traditional fossil fuels versus cleaner technologies. We also examine the cost of replacing existing coal generation with cleaner options, ranging from conventional natural gas to solar photovoltaic. We find that for most SCC values, it is more economically efficient (from a social cost\u2013benefit perspective) for the new generation to come from any of these cleaner sources rather than conventional coal, and in several instances, the cleanest sources are preferable to conventional natural gas. For existing generation, for five of the six SCC estimates we examined, replacing the average existing coal plant with conventional natural gas, natural gas with carbon capture and storage, or wind increases economic efficiency.

It has been shown that this is correlated with an increase in the temperature of the atmosphere and potential associated climate change. To mitigate this problem, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has been mooted over the past decade. In this chapter, we will focus on CO2 storage in downhole rock formations. Rock formations suitable for storage include saline aquifers and depleted oil and gas reservoirs. Also coal bed methane (CBM) reservoirs may be suitable for storage, but we will not consider these in the current chapter. In the case of saline aquifers, we consider only the storage of CO2. In the case of depleted oil/gas reservoirs, the storage of CO2 can be combined with Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR). This may lead to a more favorable economic scenario and has recently been coined as CCUS (Carbon Capture and Utilized Storage). In particular we will focus in this chapter on carbonate reservoirs. Sandstone reservoirs have been relatively well studied. However, much less is known about the storage properties of carbonate rocks, which have very different petrophysical and flow properties. Moreover, carbonate rocks constitute a significant fraction of existing depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. Our aim is to study the pore scale properties of carbonates and upscale these to the core and field scales. First, carbonates have a very different structure from sandstones, associated with their composition and diagenesis. Carbonates usually have a much broader pore size distribution (PSD) than sandstones with extensive microporosity (Cantrell and Hagerty 1999). In addition, carbonates are often naturally fractured (Ameen et al. 2010). This leads to a broad range of heterogeneity as a function of length scale, in comparison \u2026", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "5149f81cd85c24101090428e1b6caeed31ca48c3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2089697355", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2012.746070", "CorpusId": 154975098}, "title": "China's role in attaining the global 2\u00b0C target", "abstract": "In the recent climate change negotiations it was declared that the increase in global temperature should be kept below 2\u00b0C by 2100, relative to pre-industrial levels.

Thus the role of China in global GHG mitigation is crucial. A scenario analysis of China's CO2 emissions is presented here and the feasibility of China reaching a low-carbon scenario is discussed. The results suggest that recent and continued technological progress will make it possible for China to limit its CO2 emissions and for these emissions to peak before 2025 and therefore that the global 2\u00b0C target can be achieved. Policy relevance In signing the Copenhagen Accord, China agreed to the global 2\u00b0C target. Results from this article could be used to justify low-carbon development policies and negotiations. While many still doubt the feasibility of a low-carbon pathway to support the global 2\u00b0C target, the results suggest that such a pathway can be realistically achieved. This conclusion should increase confidence and guide the policy framework further to make possible China's low-carbon development. Related policies and measures, such as renewable energy development, energy efficiency, economic structure optimization, technology innovation, low-carbon investment, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) development, should be further enhanced. Furthermore, China can play a larger role in the international negotiations process.

According to IEA analysis, if there are no major policy changes, carbon-intensive coal and other fossil fuels will continue to play a significant role in meeting future energy needs, both in China and globally.

In the present research, we used structural equation modeling to examine an extensive causal model of the role of convictions and trust for the public's protest potential against carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) among a large sample of the general population (N = 769). Trust, convictions, perceived benefits, and risks were included in the model. Our model fitted the data well. Convictions regarding emission reduction, decentralization of energy production, and tampering with natural structures in the deep subsurface influenced the perception of benefits and risks. Trust, in contrast, was barely influential. Perceived benefits were more prominent for public protest potential than perceived risks. However, perceived benefits did not dominate perceived risks as much as earlier studies found for acceptance. We argue that trust can become fully effective as a determinant of perceived risks and benefits only when the public perceives the distinct positioning of the stakeholders involved. Until then, laypeople are likely to draw on their own convictions and intuitive mental concepts for making decisions about accepting a new technology or protesting it.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "217b540dd33a59e8f24a35abb5da19303444dbec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2331855304", "DOI": "10.1016/J.APENERGY.2016.03.095", "CorpusId": 112760340}, "title": "Recent progress and innovation in carbon capture and storage using bioinspired materials", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "80b71bc9d54f770d12b37280979a565fa41a8b4c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2042489663", "DOI": "10.5194/BG-12-2995-2015", "CorpusId": 615977}, "title": "Imaging tropical peatlands in Indonesia using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electrical resistivity imaging (ERI): implications for carbon stock estimates and peat soil characterization", "abstract": "Abstract. Current estimates of carbon (C) storage in peatland systems worldwide indicate that tropical peatlands comprise about 15% of the global peat carbon pool. Such estimates are uncertain due to data gaps regarding organic peat soil thickness, volume and C content. We combined a set of indirect geophysical methods (ground-penetrating radar, GPR, and electrical resistivity imaging, ERI) with direct observations using core sampling and C analysis to determine how geophysical imaging may enhance traditional coring methods for estimating peat thickness and C storage in a tropical peatland system in West Kalimantan, Indonesia. Both GPR and ERI methods demonstrated their capability to estimate peat thickness in tropical peat soils at a spatial resolution not feasible with traditional coring methods. GPR is able to capture peat thickness variability at centimeter-scale vertical resolution, although peat thickness determination was difficult for peat columns exceeding 5 m in the areas studied, due to signal attenuation associated with thick clay-rich transitional horizons at the peat\u2013mineral soil interface. ERI methods were more successful for imaging deeper peatlands with thick organomineral layers between peat and underlying mineral soil. Results obtained using GPR methods indicate less than 3% variation in peat thickness (when compared to coring methods) over low peat\u2013mineral soil interface gradients (i.e., below 0.02\u00b0) and show substantial impacts in C storage estimates (i.e., up to 37 MgC ha\u22121 even for transects showing a difference between GPR and coring estimates of 0.07 m in average peat thickness). The geophysical data also provide information on peat matrix attributes such as thickness of organomineral horizons between peat and underlying substrate, the presence of buried wood, buttressed trees or tip-up pools and soil type. The use of GPR and ERI methods to image peat profiles at high resolution can be used to further constrain quantification of peat C pools and inform responsible peatland management in Indonesia and elsewhere in the tropics.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "de8c57144aa59565d4690502eb077120650a70ac", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2561943668", "DOI": "10.1002/asia.201601442", "CorpusId": 26236481, "PubMed": "27943602"}, "title": "Boron-Functionalized Graphene Oxide-Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient CO2 Capture.", "abstract": "The capture and storage of CO2 have been suggested as an effective strategy to reduce the global emissions of greenhouse gases.

Climate geoengineering proposals seek to rectify the Earth's current and potential future radiative imbalance, either by reducing the absorption of incoming solar (shortwave) radiation, or by removing CO2 from the atmosphere and transferring it to long-lived reservoirs, thus increasing outgoing longwave radiation. A fundamental criterion for evaluating geoengineering options is their climate cooling effectiveness, which we quantify here in terms of radiative forcing potential. We use a simple analytical approach, based on energy balance considerations and pulse response functions for the decay of CO2 perturbations. This aids transparency compared to calculations with complex numerical models, but is not intended to be definitive. It allows us to compare the relative effectiveness of a range of proposals. We consider geoengineering options as additional to large reductions in CO2 emissions. By 2050, some land carbon cycle geoengineering options could be of comparable magnitude to mitigation \"wedges\", but only stratospheric aerosol injections, albedo enhancement of marine stratocumulus clouds, or sunshades in space have the potential to cool the climate back toward its pre-industrial state. Strong mitigation, combined with global-scale air capture and storage, afforestation, and bio-char production, i.e. enhanced CO2 sinks, might be able to bring CO2 back to its pre-industrial level by 2100, thus removing the need for other geoengineering. Alternatively, strong mitigation stabilising CO2 at 500 ppm, combined with geoengineered increases in the albedo of marine stratiform clouds, grasslands, croplands and human settlements might achieve a patchy cancellation of radiative forcing. Ocean fertilisation options are only worthwhile if sustained on a millennial timescale and phosphorus addition may have greater long-term potential than iron or nitrogen fertilisation. Enhancing ocean upwelling or downwelling have trivial effects on any meaningful timescale.

Fossil fuels (coupled with CO2 capture), and lower-carbon hydrogenated fuels such as natural gas are still expected to play an important role in the future.

In the context of CO2 emission reduction in power generation, energy conversion technologies that enable the implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) need to be considered. IGCC is one such technology, as it utilizes coal or biomass but does not necessarily emit CO2. We therefore investigate whether IGCC plants can, from an economic perspective, be an alternative to nuclear and/or conventional coal-fired power plants. Our research is undertaken with the help of scenario analysis. The possible shut-down of nuclear power stations as well as of outdated coal-fired power plants, together with the evolution of CO2 prices, provides the starting point of our study. The option of hot gas cleaning in IGCC plants is of particular interest, as it is expected to significantly enhance the efficiency of IGCC technology and allows for combined heat and power production (CHP). Corresponding supplementary earnings (incl. subsidies) are compared with an increase in specific investment costs. Besides the hot gas cleaning advancement, we also investigate the injection of pure CO2 (separated from the IGCC process) into oilfields, as it reduces the costs of CO2 transport and storage through Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR).

The strong negative correlation between soil [CO(2)] and [O(2)] during the injection period created a hypoxic soil environment under conditions of elevated soil [CO(2)].

We begin by discussing the types of reservoir available for carbon storage and the mechanisms of viable CO2 storage, before summarising the physical chemistry involved in data interpretation and the sampling/sample storage techniques and requirements critical to successful sample collection. Theory of noble gas partitioning is interspersed with examples from a variety reservoirs to aid our knowledge of long term CO2 storage in the subsurface.

We also present recent work using noble gases for monitoring of subsurface CO2 migration and leakage in CO2 rich soils, CO2 rich springs and groundwaters.

Simulation of CO2 injection inherently poses a multi-physics problem coupling thermal, hydrologic, and geomechanical processes. In this paper, a set of 2D coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical modeling was performed to simulate stress changes and resulting geomechanical deformations in the reservoir, caprock and fault due to CO2 injection. The model included a limited-dimension pre-existing fault which cannot be easily detected by surveys. The fault slip obtained from the numerical model was then used along with seismological theories to estimate the maximum magnitude of induced earthquake. A parametric study was performed to investigate the effects of reservoir properties as well as thermal stresses on geomechanical deformation, fault slip, pore pressure generation versus time, rupture time, and magnitude of induced events. The effects of permeability, porosity, and thickness of the reservoir were discussed. It was shown that thinner reservoirs have higher probability of fault reactivation and will result in larger induced seismic events. Reservoirs with higher porosity were shown to have longer rupture time and induce larger events. A higher permeable reservoir can decrease the potential of fault reactivation by generating lower buildup pore pressure and smaller fault slip.

Peter Smith is critical of the target because it fails to adequately set out a process for dealing with the diversity of housing and it is not clear what the baseline for making the cuts happens to be. Chapters are also devoted to exploring innovative building projects in non-domestic buildings (which appear to be largely offices in low rise suburban office parks) and in community buildings such as schools. One interesting example of literally lateral thinking is to use pipe networks under a school asphalt playground/car-park as a thermal heat collector for nearby school buildings. In the final chapters, the author Peter Smith changes tack and shifts the debate to energy. This appears to potentially weaken the book\u2019s focus on climate-proofing human settlements, however, in analysing how urban areas can be made environmentally sustainable, it closes the circle of the argument. It is pointed out that against the backdrop of climate change, governments expect their economies to continue to expand and, to do this, more energy will be needed (or greater efficiencies in the use of energy will be required). The book raises the issue of nuclear energy, and whilst not openly advocating a switch to nuclear energy, nevertheless raises evidence (including that from James Lovelock) that catastrophic climate change from rising carbon emissions can only be avoided in the short term through switching to nuclear energy where renewables cannot fill the gap. The discussion on the role of coal is more of an observation about the trend towards continuing investment in coal-fired power generation in the UK whilst hoping that carbon sequestration technologies will eventually come on line in the future to capture the resulting carbon emissions. The book has some good discussion on what it describes as \u2018utility scale renewables\u2019 with particular emphasis on technologies best suited to the UK (such as wind and ocean currents). Peter Smith sees a fundamental revolution in UK power generation occurring in which local and local community networks using mini-renewables such as photovoltaics feed into a slimmed down national grid with greater reliance on utility scale renewables. Surreptitiously, Peter Smith quotes Mackay who favours nuclear power because a renewable-based energy solution will be large and intrusive. Peter Smith in an earlier chapter does examine the difficulties presented by the variability in power from renewables but then explores technologies that can store the energy captured from renewables for later release into the electricity grid when needed (such as with hydro-electric storage dams and fuel cells). A chapter is devoted to transport, although whilst relevant in an overall sense in exploring how society should tackle climate change, the connection with the preceding discussion in the book was not established. However, given that the move to zero carbon emission transport has significant impacts and knock-on effects for power generation, which in turn affects how buildings are used it is an important element, particularly as the looming phenomenon of Peak Oil begins to constrain the availability of future oil. The final chapter briefly warns against complacency and restates the case for the massive scale of change required to copewith andmitigate the effects of climate change. Amechanism and process for avoiding climate catastrophe is not developed; rather, the book relies on its previous chapters to suggest that it is technically feasible to respond to the challenges presented. The last point in the book appears to accept climate change as a fait accompli, meaning that our future response will be one of adaptation of our buildings and infrastructure, rather than aiming for nomore than 28Cof global temperature increase as the Copenhagen Conference advocated.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "451bee5ead77ae7e7b3fc1c05e836d4086d80fd9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2147437879", "DOI": "10.1504/IJGENVI.2008.017265", "CorpusId": 154197957}, "title": "Initial public perceptions of carbon sequestration : implications for engagement and environmental risk communication strategies", "abstract": "Despite widespread scientific acceptance, little is known about how the public perceives carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capturing and storing carbon dioxide in underground sites.

The permanence of CO2 storage in geological repositories is important since large leakage rates would diminish the CO2 abatement achieved with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). Effective permanent geologic CO2 storage depends ultimately on the interactions of the supercritical CO2 with the minerals and fluids present in the host underground repositories and their caprock sealing (Xu et al. 2005; Kharaka et al. 2006, 2010; Benson and Cole 2008). Migration of supercritical CO2 within these geological repositories is controlled by confinement/trapping of CO2 in the porous structure as well as solubility of CO2 in the fluids (brine and hydrocarbons) already present in the storage formation (Cole et al. 2010; Doughty 2010). In deep saline aquifers, the dissolution of CO2 in water generates carbonic acid, which in turn reacts with minerals such as clay, mica and feldspar and carbonates present in the reservoir rocks to generate cations and carbonate/bicarbonate ions (Kaszuba et al. 2003, 2005; Kharaka et al. 2006; Ketzer et al. 2009; Cole et al. 2010; Doughty 2010). Finally, precipitation of metal carbonate occurs either by direct or indirect reaction of the CO2 with other minerals and organic matter present in the reservoirs (Garcia et al. 2012; Kharaka et al. 2010; Shao et al. 2010, Xu et al. 2004, 2005).\n\nIt is essential to understand and predict the chemical reactions and stability of mineral phases formed under sequestration conditions as these could affect the migration of CO2 and the seal \u2026", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "762a04a4269d417f69ce6ca8951c7af6b0f512d8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2171376857", "DOI": "10.1111/gcbb.12228", "CorpusId": 85952073}, "title": "Competing uses of biomass for energy and chemicals: implications for long\u2010term global CO2 mitigation potential", "abstract": "Biomass is considered a low carbon source for various energy or chemical options. This paper assesses it's different possible uses, the competition between these uses, and the implications for long\u2010term global energy demand and energy system emissions. A scenario analysis is performed using the TIMER energy system model. Under baseline conditions, 170 EJ yr\u22121 of secondary bioenergy is consumed in 2100 (approximately 18% of total secondary energy demand), used primarily in the transport, buildings and nonenergy (chemical production) sectors. This leads to a reduction of 9% of CO2 emissions compared to a counterfactual scenario where no bioenergy is used. Bioenergy can contribute up to 40% reduction in emissions at carbon taxes greater than 500/tC. As higher CO2 taxes are applied, bioenergy is increasingly diverted towards electricity generation. Results are more sensitive to assumptions about resource availability than technological parameters. To estimate the effectiveness of bioenergy in specific sectors, experiments are performed in which bioenergy is only allowed in one sector at a time. The results show that cross\u2010sectoral leakage and emissions from biomass conversion limit the total emission reduction possible in each sector. In terms of reducing emissions per unit of bioenergy use, we show that the use of bioelectricity is the most effective, especially when used with carbon capture and storage.

Among the porous physisorbents, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of promising candidates for gas separation and storage owing to their extraordinarily high specific surface areas and pore volumes, and predesigned pore structures. Here, we report three interpenetrated MOFs composed of Zn4O clusters and rigid dicarboxylate anions, namely SUMOF-n (SU = Stockholm University; n = 2, 3, 4). All the interpenetrated MOFs possess small pores of two different types and high pore volumes. SUMOF-2 had a structure similar to interpenetrated MOF-5, but with an extra-framework cation present in one of the two types of pores. SUMOF-3 was an interpenetrated version of IRMOF-8 while SUMOF-4 crystallized with mixed linkers, biphenyl-4,4\u2032-dicarboxylic acid and benzene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid. Among the three SUMOFs, SUMOF-4 had the largest specific surface area (1612 m2 g\u22121) and pore volume. Single component adsorption of CO2 and N2 was determined at 273 K. We showed that the interpenetrated SUMOF-2 adsorbed more CO2 than non-interpenetrated MOF-5 under 273 K and 1 bar. This may be explained by the increased electric field gradients due to the interpenetration in the MOF. The uptake of CO2 for SUMOF-2 and SUMOF-4 was significant at somewhat higher pressure. Their CO2 isotherms were close to linear, which could be beneficial for separation of CO2via pressure swing adsorption from biogas or natural gas.

The Leakage Risk Monetization Model was used to estimate the costs of leakage for representative CO2 injection scenarios, and these costs were incorporated into the Global Change Assessment Model. Worst-case scenarios of CO2 leakage risk, which assume that all leakage pathway permeabilities are extremely high, were simulated. Even with this extreme assumption, the associated costs of monitoring, treatment, containment, and remediation resulted in minor shifts in the global energy system. For example, the reduction in CCS deployment in the electricity sector was 3% for the \u201chigh\u201d leakage scenario, with replacement coming from fossil fuel and biomass without CCS, nuclear power, and renewable energy. In other words, the impact on CCS deployment under a realistic leakage scenario is likely to be negligible. We also quantified how the resulting shifts will impact atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Under a carbon tax that achieves an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 480\u00a0ppm in 2100, technology shifts due to leakage costs would increase this concentration by less than 5\u00a0ppm. It is important to emphasize that this increase does not result from leaked CO2 that reaches the land surface, which is minimal due to secondary trapping in geologic strata above the storage reservoir. The overall conclusion is that leakage risks and associated costs will likely not interfere with the effectiveness of policies for climate change mitigation.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "13670f7713bc4260bde04ed73a8d1d75b417e37c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2569691075", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.joc.6b02755", "CorpusId": 38863613, "PubMed": "28067512"}, "title": "Substituent and Solvent Effects on the Stability of N-Heterocyclic Carbene Complexes with CO2.", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide forms covalent complexes with N-heterocyclic carbenes.

Polar environments lead to a kinetically stronger, shorter, and more polar bond between the carbene and CO2. The current study shows that this solvent effect is general across a wide range of NHC complexes with CO2. Computational modeling at the DFT level shows that the lability of these bonds can be controlled by steric pressure due to substituents on the heteroatoms flanking the carbene center, as well as inductive electronic effects from substituents on the C4 and C5 positions.
