As such, an important question is the scale of carbon dioxide abatement we require from CCS to meet future climate targets, and whether they appear reasonable. For a number of energy technology and efficiency improvement scenarios, we use a simple climate model to assess the necessary contribution from CCS to \u2018fill the gap\u2019 between scenarios\u2019 carbon dioxide emissions levels and the levels needed to meet alternative climate targets. The need for CCS depends on early or delayed action to curb emissions and the characteristics of the assumed energy scenario. To meet a 2.5\u00b0C target a large contribution and fast deployment rates for CCS are required. The required deployment rates are much faster than those seen in the deployment of renewable energy technologies as well as nuclear power the last decades, and may not be feasible. This indicates that more contributions are needed from other low-carbon energy technologies and improved energy efficiency, or substitution of coal for gas in the first half of the century. In addition the limited availability of coal and gas by end of the century and resulting limited scope for CCS implies that meeting the 2.5\u00b0C target would require significant contributions from one or more of the following options: CCS linked to oil use, biomass energy based CCS (BECCS), and CCS linked to industrial processes.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "e3d3ead40938d9b1e74d1e6e6de82d8a5e5559a3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2078386898", "DOI": "10.1021/es203037j", "CorpusId": 27785622, "PubMed": "22191735"}, "title": "Stakeholder views on financing carbon capture and storage demonstration projects in China.", "abstract": "Chinese stakeholders (131) from 68 key institutions in 27 provinces were consulted in spring 2009 in an online survey of their perceptions of the barriers and opportunities in financing large-scale carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) demonstration projects in China. The online survey was supplemented by 31 follow-up face-to-face interviews. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) was widely perceived as the most important institution in authorizing the first commercial-scale CCS demonstration project and authorization was viewed as more similar to that for a power project than a chemicals project. There were disagreements, however, on the appropriate size for a demonstration plant, the type of capture, and the type of storage. Most stakeholders believed that the international image of the Chinese Government could benefit from demonstrating commercial CCS and that such a project could also create advantages for Chinese companies investing in CCS technologies. In more detailed interviews with 16 financial officials, we found striking disagreements over the perceived risks of demonstrating CCS. The rate of return seen as appropriate for financing demonstration projects was split between stakeholders from development banks (who supported a rate of 5-8%) and those from commercial banks (12-20%). The divergence on rate alone could result in as much as a 40% difference in the cost of CO(2) abatement and 56% higher levelized cost of electricity based on a hypothetical case study of a typical 600-MW new build ultrasupercritical pulverized coal-fired (USCPC) power plant.

That means that CCS must deliver consistent environmental and social benefits which exceed its costs of capital, energy and operation; it must be protective of the environment and human health over the long term; and it must be suitable for deployment on a significant scale. CCS is one of the more expensive and technically challenging carbon emissions abatement options available, and CCS must first and foremost be considered in the context of the other things that can be done to reduce emissions, as a part of an overall optimally efficient, sustainable and economic mitigation plan. This elevates the analysis beyond a simple comparison of the cost per tonne of CO2 abated\u2014there are inherent tradeoffs with a range of other factors (such as water, NOx, SOx, biodiversity, energy, and human health and safety, among others) which must also be considered if we are to achieve truly sustainable mitigation. The full life-cycle cost of CCS must be considered in the context of the overall social, environmental and economic benefits which it creates, and the costs associated with environmental and social risks it presents. Such analysis reveals that all CCS is not created equal. There is a wide range of technological options available which can be used in a variety of industries and applications\u2014indeed CCS is not applicable to every industry. Stationary fossil-fuel powered energy and large scale petroleum industry operations are two examples of industries which could benefit from CCS. Capturing and geo-sequestering CO2 entrained in natural gas can be economic and sustainable at relatively low carbon prices, and in many jurisdictions makes financial sense for operators to deploy now, if suitable secure disposal reservoirs are available close by. Retrofitting existing coal-fired power plants, however, is more expensive and technically challenging, and the economic sustainability of post-combustion capture retrofit needs to be compared on a portfolio basis to the relative overall net benefit of CCS on new-build plants, where energy efficiency can be optimised as a first step, and locations can be selected with sequestration sites in mind. Examples from the natural gas processing, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and coal-fired power generation sectors, illustrate that there is currently a wide range of financial costs for CCS, depending on how and where it is applied, but equally, environmental and social benefits of emissions reduction can be considerable. Some CCS applications are far more economic and sustainable than others.

The framework of CCS will require utilities to adopt business models that ensure both safe and affordable CCS operations while maintaining reliable power generation. Physical models include an infrastructure with centralized CO(2) pipelines that focus geologic sequestration in pooled regional storage sites or supply CO(2) for beneficial use in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and a dispersed plant model with sequestration operations which take place in close proximity to CO(2) capture. Several prototypical business models, including hybrids of these two poles, will be in play including a self-build option, a joint venture, and a pay at the gate model. In the self-build model operations are vertically integrated and utility owned and operated by an internal staff of engineers and geologists. A joint venture model stresses a partnership between the host site utility/owner's engineer and external operators and consultants. The pay to take model is turn-key external contracting to a third party owner/operator with cash positive fees paid out for sequestration and cash positive income for CO(2)-EOR. The selection of a business model for CCS will be based in part on the desire of utilities to be vertically integrated, source-sink economics, and demand for CO(2)-EOR. Another element in this decision will be how engaged a utility decides to be and the experience the utility has had with precommercial R&D activities. Through R&D, utilities would likely have already addressed or at least been exposed to the many technical, regulatory, and risk management issues related to successful CCS.

Deployment of energy storage is expected to increase grid stability and renewable energy utilisation. The power sector of the future, therefore, needs to seek a synergy between renewable energy sources and low-carbon fossil fuel power generation. This can be achieved via wide deployment of CCS linked with energy storage.

The bacterial hydrolysis of urea (ureolysis) was investigated in microcosms including synthetic brine (SB) mimicking a prospective deep subsurface CCS site with variable headspace pressures [p(CO(2))] of (13)C-CO(2). Dissolved Ca(2+) in the SB was completely precipitated as calcite during microbially induced hydrolysis of 5-20 g L(-1) urea. The incorporation of carbonate ions from (13)C-CO(2) ((13)C-CO(3)(2-)) into calcite increased with increasing p((13)CO(2)) and increasing urea concentrations: from 8.3% of total carbon in CaCO(3) at 1 g L(-1) to 31% at 5 g L(-1), and 37% at 20 g L(-1). This demonstrated that ureolysis was effective at precipitating initially gaseous [CO(2)(g)] originating from the headspace over the brine. Modeling the change in brine chemistry and carbonate precipitation after equilibration with the initial p(CO(2)) demonstrated that no net precipitation of CO(2)(g) via mineral-trapping occurred, since urea hydrolysis results in the production of dissolved inorganic carbon. However, the pH increase induced by bacterial ureolysis generated a net flux of CO(2)(g) into the brine. This reduced the headspace concentration of CO(2) by up to 32 mM per 100 mM urea hydrolyzed because the capacity of the brine for carbonate ions was increased, thus enhancing the solubility-trapping capacity of the brine. Together with the previously demonstrated permeability reduction of rock cores at high pressure by microbial biofilms and resilience of biofilms to supercritical CO(2), this suggests that engineered biomineralizing biofilms may enhance CCS via solubility-trapping, mineral formation, and CO(2)(g) leakage reduction.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "95a9135efcc843a07f648673765cda5183cd7216", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1997292039", "DOI": "10.1016/J.APENERGY.2013.01.062", "CorpusId": 108566660}, "title": "A review on carbon dioxide capture and storage technology using coal fly ash", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "b50d159d9956b6d2fbef291fec0d45096ca2ccbf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2020613674", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2011.03.014", "CorpusId": 108585970}, "title": "Demonstrations of coal-fired oxy-fuel technology for carbon capture and storage and issues with commercial deployment", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "0c5835034664aaf2f156dd1f2f418f5a2d8b96ef", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1983658701", "DOI": "10.1021/es200510f", "CorpusId": 39362491, "PubMed": "21905694"}, "title": "Greening coal: breakthroughs and challenges in carbon capture and storage.", "abstract": "Like it or not, coal is here to stay, for the next few decades at least.

The IEA carries out a comprehensive programme of energy cooperation among its member countries, each of which is obliged to hold oil stocks equivalent to 90 days of its net imports. The Agency's aims include the following objectives: n Secure member countries' access to reliable and ample supplies of all forms of energy; in particular, through maintaining effective emergency response capabilities in case of oil supply disruptions. n Promote sustainable energy policies that spur economic growth and environmental protection in a global context \u2013 particularly in terms of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions that contribute to climate change. n Improve transparency of international markets through collection and analysis of energy data. n Support global collaboration on energy technology to secure future energy supplies and mitigate their environmental impact, including through improved energy efficiency and development and deployment of low-carbon technologies. n Find solutions to global energy challenges through engagement and dialogue with non-member countries, industry, international organisations and other stakeholders.

We present a scalable mixed integer, multiperiod, welfare-optimizing network model for Europe, called CCTS-Mod. The model incorporates endogenous decisions on carbon capture, pipeline and storage investments, as well as capture, flow and injection quantities based on given costs, CO2 prices, storage capacities, and point source emissions. Given full information about future costs of CCTS-technology, and CO2 prices, the model determines a cost minimizing strategy on whether to purchase CO2 certificates, or to abate the CO2 through investments into a CCTS-chain on a site by site basis. We apply the model to analyze different scenarios for the deployment of CCTS in Europe, e.g., under high and low CO2 prices, respectively. We find that beyond CO2 prices of \u20ac50 per t, CCTS can contribute to the decarbonization of Europe\u2019s industry sectors, as long as one assumes sufficient storage capacities (onshore and/or offshore).

Good analogues for the hydrogeological effects of UCG are provided by longwall mining. Careful planning of UCG void locations and dimensions can result in minimal disturbance of overlying aquifers as close as 40\u00a0m above the burn zone. Moreover, development of a pressure arch above the zone of net strata extension can provide a hydraulic seal to prevent vertical fluid migration. Injection of CO2 into former UCG voids ought to be possible where these are present at depths in excess of\u00a0\u2248\u00a0800\u00a0m. Analogies to longwall mining suggest that extensional deformation immediately above the burn zone will render sufficient pore space accessible to accommodate all of the CO2 arising from gasification. In the absence of adequate engineering, the boreholes used in the UCG-CCS processes represent the most likely leakage pathways for injected CO2. Hence high-quality borehole engineering will be required, taking full account of thermal performance of casing and grout, and geophysical testing of borehole integrity.

CCS is envisioned to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere when applied to large facilities that use fossil fuels. Applied to biomass, it may also lower CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere while supplying energy. The publication of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2005) Special Report on CCS (SRCCS) raised the profile of CCS, particularly among the expert community dealing with international climate policy (Meadowcroft and Langhelle 2009). The expert community now commonly sees CCS as a major option for reducing global emissions of CO2. The technology plays a major role in long-term scenarios where there is significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (Clarke et al. 2009; IEA 2010a). For CCS to play such a major role, the separation, transport and storage would have to handle large volumes of CO2, and involve huge investments in facilities and infrastructure. The SRCCS conveyed some key insights. First, it clearly indicated that in principle, CCS is technically feasible. It also found that subsurface endowments of geological storage are probably massive, but regionally distributed and still highly uncertain.

A potential technology that allows for the consumption of fossil fuel with a minimized emission rate is Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Malaysia is a fast developing economy with a historical trend of high reliance on fossil fuel for its energy needs. Therefore, there is compelling motivation to consider CCS for the country's GHG emission reduction initiative. This paper reviews the potential for carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a part of the climate change mitigation strategy for the Malaysian electricity sector using a technology assessment framework. The suitability and practicality of the technology was reviewed from a broad perspective with a consideration of Malaysia specific conditions. There had been a number of prior assessments on the suitability of CCS as a mitigation technology. Nonetheless, most of these assessments are typically more inclined towards the review from an economic viewpoint and are centered towards the case of developed economies. This study aims to fulfill this gap of knowledge and assess the technology from a broad sense in the Malaysia settings. It is apparent to this assessment that CCS has the potential to play an important role in Malaysia's climate change mitigation strategy. However, this study also identified key criteria that would need to be in place for CCS to be an effective climate change mitigation technology for the case of Malaysia.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "74b35e2a0f7a33d48053003d84c31b053dedcbd7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2031679564", "DOI": "10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2011.02.005", "CorpusId": 153642222}, "title": "Toward policy integration: Assessing carbon capture and storage policies in Japan and Norway", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "2748a08f2355c7d5d6fbcb8cd62a8043441dca0e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1967177668", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENERGY.2011.08.030", "CorpusId": 103605681}, "title": "Getting ready for carbon capture and storage through a CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) Ready Hub", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "ca77140aa55a192d3b349564c08d64a2a62ab16b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2002051531", "DOI": "10.1016/J.EGYPRO.2011.02.562", "CorpusId": 109165412}, "title": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration projects in Canada", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "3bafb415841d8ac413d28871d8ea650c4e22c715", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2078005779", "DOI": "10.1016/J.PSEP.2011.06.021", "CorpusId": 110627129}, "title": "Addressing emerging risks using carbon capture and storage as an example", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "6e28363190ff8a5509dc77799c0a291f36a715c7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2018987218", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2011.08.022", "CorpusId": 153974713}, "title": "Carbon capture and storage\u2014Investment strategies for the future?", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "971a892e8a08affe6d44f5446f0761ee388ec6d6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2264892973", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2011.07.004", "CorpusId": 11846071}, "title": "Actuarial risk assessment of expected fatalities attributable to carbon capture and storage in 2050", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "84b7dced11365843f88d7bcded10bda65d4a80a5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2003144163", "DOI": "10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2011.01.012", "CorpusId": 153868053}, "title": "The socio-political context for deploying carbon capture and storage in China and the U.S", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "f233ce241881a6aa461da6a585f033c6a949d036", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2565209933", "PubMedCentral": "5253711", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.jpcc.6b10363", "CorpusId": 14952463, "PubMed": "28127415"}, "title": "Rational Design of a Low-Cost, High-Performance Metal\u2013Organic Framework for Hydrogen Storage and Carbon Capture", "abstract": "We present the in silico design of a MOF-74 analogue, hereon known as M2(DHFUMA) [M = Mg, Fe, Co, Ni, Zn], with enhanced small-molecule adsorption properties over the original M2(DOBDC) series. Constructed from 2,3-dihydroxyfumarate (DHFUMA), an aliphatic ligand which is smaller than the aromatic 2,5-dioxidobenzene-1,4-dicarboxylate (DOBDC), the M2(DHFUMA) framework has a reduced channel diameter, resulting in higher volumetric density of open metal sites and significantly improved volumetric hydrogen (H2) storage potential. Furthermore, the reduced distance between two adjacent open metal sites in the pore channel leads to a CO2 binding mode of one molecule per two adjacent metals with markedly stronger binding energetics. Through dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT) calculations of guest\u2013framework interactions and classical simulation of the adsorption behavior of binary CO2:H2O mixtures, we theoretically predict the M2(DHFUMA) series as an improved alternative for carbon capture over the M2(DOBDC) series when adsorbing from wet flue gas streams.

Some wastes, because of their reactivity characteristics, have emergent values that go beyond purely economic and into the environmentally beneficial realm. This article discusses the changing paradigm of mine waste management. Such fundamental parameters, such as cut-off grade and strip ratio, are positively impacted by the revaluation of waste rock material. Mine rock waste can now be seen as a commodity of value similar to the underlying ore being mined, which influences the economic performance of suitable projects. This valuable material can be used for industrial purposes including acid neutralisation as well as the capture and long-term disposal of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. The Turnagain Nickel project, located in Northern British Columbia, serves as an example of how waste rock material can become an important matrix for carbon capture and sequestration and how a project can benefit economically from it. By producing material that has emergent economic value as well as carbon capture and sequestration capabilities, the sequestration matrix producer is a beneficiary of new carbon credits that have a market value and is looked upon favourably by regulatory authorities and affected stakeholders.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "c4f2219eeed0291a6d681d515b4ebb0e4469c085", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3096005035", "DOI": "10.3390/en13215692", "CorpusId": 228926783}, "title": "CO2 Capture, Use, and Storage in the Cement Industry: State of the Art and Expectations", "abstract": "The implementation of carbon capture, use, and storage in the cement industry is a necessity, not an option, if the climate targets are to be met.

Compared to the other NPs, TiO2 nanofluids exhibit superior stability due to their high zeta potential. In previous studies, TiO2 nanofluids have shown superior performance in heat transfer and cooling applications along with importing the stability of other nanofluids like SiO2 in form of nanocomposites. Therefore, in this study, a nanofluid formulation consisting of titania nanofluid in a base solution of ethylene glycol (EG) with different co-stabilizers such as surfactants was synthesized for better dispersion stability, enhanced electrical, and rheological properties especially for the use in high-temperature industrial applications which include carbon capture and storage along with enhanced oil recovery. The formulated nanofluid was investigated for stability using dynamic light scattering (DLS) study and electrical conductivity. Additionally, the formulated nanofluid was also examined for thermal stability at high temperatures using an electrical conductivity study followed by rheological measurements at 30 and 90 \u00b0C. At a high temperature, the shear-thinning behavior of EG was found highly affected by shear rate; however, this deformation was controlled using TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). Furthermore, the role of surfactant was also investigated on dispersion stability, electrical conductivity followed by viscosity results, and it was found that the nanofluid is superior in presence of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as compared to nonionic surfactant Triton X-100 (TX-100). The inclusion of ionic surfactant provides a charged layer of micelles surrounding the core of a NP and it produced additional surface potential. Consequently, it increases the repulsive force between two adjacent NPs and renders a greater stability to nanofluid while nonionic surfactant allowed monomers to adsorb on the surface of NP via hydrophobic interaction and enhances the short-range interparticle repulsion, to stabilize nanofluid. This makes titania nanofluid suitable for widespread high-temperature applications where conventional nanofluids face limitations. Finally, the application of the synthesized titania nanofluids was explored for the capture and transport of CO2 where the inclusion of the anionic surfactant was found to increase the CO2 capturing ability of titania nanofluids by 140\u2013220% (over the conventional nanofluid) while also showing superior retention at both investigated temperatures. Thus, the study promotes the role of novel surfactant-treated titania nanofluids for carbon removal and storage and recommends their applications involving carbonated fluid injection (CFI) to carbon utilization in oilfield applications.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "9dd16dc5f90251bc6c59eba1c1559c318a21a461", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2526601878", "CorpusId": 114931137}, "title": "Biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS): a review.", "abstract": "This is a review paper intended to provide an overview of debates relating to BECCS or bio-CCS, which are alternative terms for the coupling of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (CCS). The paper follows from a workshop held in December 2009, hosted by the Scottish Centre for Carbon Capture and Storage at the University of Edinburgh, organised by Tyndall Manchester at the University of Manchester and funded by the Tyndall Centre. The principal rationale for BECCS is that whereas the current atmospheric concentration of CO2 is more than 380ppmv and rising, achieving the European policy aspiration of not exceeding a global temperature rise of 2?C is likely to require atmospheric concentrations of below 350ppmv CO2e. In theory, BECCS has the potential to help to bring the atmospheric CO2 concentration to below present levels, or at least to contribute to its reduction by delivering ?negative emissions?. By capturing and storing the CO2 absorbed from the atmosphere by bioenergy feedstocks, BECCS can, in theory, deliver power and heat production with net negative emissions. Yet, while BECCS enthusiasts have drawn support from scenarios of large scale global bioenergy supply and its co-option into BECCS systems, the assumptions of sufficient accessible CCS capture, pipeline and storage infrastructure and that large scale bioenergy supply can be reconciled with competing uses of land (and water) are both uncertain. While biomass co-firing with coal offers an early route to BECCS, a quite substantial (>20%) biomass component may be necessary to achieve negative emissions in a co-fired BECCS system (a percentage that is dependent, of course, on system assumptions). Financially, significant incentives will be necessary to establish either BECCS or CCS; neither are currently competitive in Europe, given carbon prices within the EU ETS which is also not currently designed to credit negative emissions. Nonetheless, in cost terms, bioenergy compares well with other carbon abatement options, particularly if wastes or residues are used as fuel, and modelling suggests that BECCS would be an important component of energy systems intended to reach 350pmv CO2e. We judge that BECCS can and likely will play a role in carbon reduction, but that care needs to be taken to minimise the risks of disincentivising inherently low carbon energy systems via lock-in of fossil CCS. Care also needs to be taken not to exaggerate the potential of BECCS, given that (a) there are few studies of the cost of connecting bio-processing (combustion, gasification or other) infrastructure with CO2 storage sites; and (b) that scenarios of global bioenergy potential remain contentious.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "08ace11e5448ae50cb8af16224c99c611d6a3f38", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2105353001", "DOI": "10.1016/S1750-5836(07)00119-3", "CorpusId": 111347870}, "title": "An engineering-economic model of pipeline transport of CO2 with application to carbon capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "405f385c6d296cbbcb838b951e1ca1ecb35f4373", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2108072062", "DOI": "10.1001/jama.2009.1951", "CorpusId": 27121829, "PubMed": "20051572"}, "title": "Health and safety risks of carbon capture and storage.", "abstract": "CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE (CCS) IS A TECHnology being developed in an attempt to slow global warming. In theory, CCS would prevent carbon dioxide produced from coal-fired power plants from reaching the atmosphere by capturing and storing it permanently underground. The scale of this proposal is remarkable, requiring the capture of tens of billions of tons of carbon dioxide from thousands of coal and gas power plants throughout the world. Although carbon dioxide has been injected underground to enhance oil recovery from old wells, the use of the technology to permanently store carbon dioxide is still in a demonstration phase. Carbon capture and storage may receive billions of dollars of taxpayer support in pending energy legislation, the American Clean Energy and Security Act passed by the US House of Representatives in June 2009. Despite widespread political support for the technology, important and unanswered questions remain regarding CCS development. What risks to human health and safety are involved?

If CCS is to reach its full potential to contribute to global efforts to mitigate the risk of dangerous climate change, it is urgent that a number of actions begin now in order to be ready for CCS deployment from around 2020 using proven designs that can be built in large numbers. This article discusses some key challenges for CCS, with a focus on development in the next decade, highlighting the potential benefits of a two tranche programme for integrated commercial-scale demonstration to develop proven reference plant designs and reviewing the importance of distinguishing between different classes of CCS according to their ability to significantly reduce CO2 emissions associated with fossil fuel use.

CO2 emissions from biomass conversion processes can also be captured. If that is done, biomass energy with CO2 capture and storage (BECS) would become a technology that removes CO2 from the atmosphere and at the same time deliver CO2-neutral energy carriers (heat, electricity or hydrogen) to society. Here we present estimates of the costs and conversion efficiency of electricity, hydrogen and heat generation from fossil fuels and biomass with CO2 capture and storage. We then insert these technology characteristics into a global energy and transportation model (GET 5.0), and calculate costs of stabilizing atmospheric CO2 concentration at 350 and 450 ppm. We find that carbon capture and storage technologies applied to fossil fuels have the potential to reduce the cost of meeting the 350 ppm stabilisation targets by 50% compared to a case where these technologies are not available and by 80% when BECS is allowed. For the 450 ppm scenario, the reduction in costs is 40 and 42%, respectively. Thus, the difference in costs between cases where BECS technologies are allowed and where they are not is marginal for the 450 ppm stabilization target. It is for very low stabilization targets that negative emissions become warranted, and this makes BECS more valuable than in cases with higher stabilization targets. Systematic and stochastic sensitivity analysis is performed. Finally, BECS opens up the possibility to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. But this option should not be seen as an argument in favour of doing nothing about the climate problem now and then switching on this technology if climate change turns out to be a significant problem. It is not likely that BECS can be initiated sufficiently rapidly at a sufficient scale to follow this path to avoiding abrupt and serious climate changes if that would happen.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "0594a9b2b8766578c418d7d4ff43780ad2644518", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1975116072", "DOI": "10.1243/09576509JPE623", "CorpusId": 140693757}, "title": "An initial assessment of the potential environmental impact of CO2 escape from marine carbon capture and storage systems", "abstract": "Abstract If carbon capture and storage is to be adopted as a CO2 mitigation strategy, it is important to understand the associated risks. The risk analysis consists of several elements such as leakage probability, assessing the strength of environmental perturbation, and quantifying the ecological, economic, and social impacts. Here, the environmental perturbation aspect is addressed by using a marine system model of the North West European Shelf seas to simulate the consequences of CO2 additions such as those that could arise from a failure of geological sequestration schemes. Little information exists to guide the choice of leak scenario and many assumptions are required; for consistency the assumptions err towards greater impact and what would be in likelihood extreme scenarios. The simulations indicate that only the largest leakage scenarios tested are capable of producing perturbations that are likely to have environmental consequences beyond the locality of a leak event. It is shown that, given the available evidence, the chemical perturbation of a sequestration leak, regionally integrated, is likely to be insignificant when compared with that from continued non-mitigated atmospheric CO2 emissions and the subsequent acidification of the marine system. The potential ecological impacts of a large environmental CO2 perturbation are reviewed, indicating that the biogeochemical functioning and biodiversity are sensitive.

There are three options for capturing CO 2 from point sources: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, and oxy-combustion. Several processes are available to capture CO 2 , and new or improved processes are under development. However, CO 2 capture is the most expensive part of CCS, typically accounting for 75% of overall cost. CCS will benefit significantly from the development of a lower cost post-combustion CO 2 capture process that can be retrofitted to existing power plants. Once captured, the CO 2 is compressed to about 150 atm and pipelined at supercritical conditions to a suitable storage site. Oil and gas reservoirs, because they have assured seals and are well characterized, are promising early opportunity sites. Saline formations are much more extensive and have a huge potential storage capacity, but are much less characterized. Several commercial and a number of pilot CCS projects are underway around the world. Information from these projects will form the basis for the development of CCS as a climate change mitigation strategy. These projects are contributing to the development of suitable regulations, determining best operating practices, improving mathematical models, and providing information to the public and other stakeholders. Based on current knowledge, CCS appears to be a promising option for reducing GHG emissions.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "dbf9141bad6e0a0bf10f94b3e7684aaa529fdef3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2898228558", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2018.08.014", "CorpusId": 104645125}, "title": "The rapid and cost-effective capture and subsurface mineral storage of carbon and sulfur at the CarbFix2 site", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "3f4149032f6e6229e936c340ad5f297a6756419c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2041342193", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-009-9632-0", "CorpusId": 155055918}, "title": "Envisioning carbon capture and storage: expanded possibilities due to air capture, leakage insurance, and C-14 monitoring", "abstract": "In order to meet the challenge of climate change while allowing for continued economic development, the world will have to adopt a net zero carbon energy infrastructure. Due to the world\u2019s large stock of low-cost fossil fuels, there is strong motivation to explore the opportunities for capturing the CO2 that is produced in the combustion of fossil fuels and keeping it out of the atmosphere. Three distinct sets of technologies are needed to allow for climate neutral use of fossil fuels: (1) capture of CO2 at concentrated sources like electric power plants, future hydrogen production plants and steel and cement plants; (2) capture of CO2 from the air; and (3) the safe and permanent storage of CO2 away from the atmosphere. A strong regime of carbon accounting is also necessary to gain the public\u2019s trust in the safety and permanence of CO2 storage. This paper begins with an extensive overview of carbon capture and storage technologies, and then presents a vision for the potential implementation of carbon capture and storage, drawing upon new ideas such as air capture technology, leakage insurance, and monitoring using a radioactive isotope such as C-14.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can also be viewed in this way to some extent, for example, as a means to keep coal as an electricity generation fuel in Europe and the USA. But the underlying driver for CCS is really that less fossil carbon is being emitted to the atmosphere. Since long-term cumulative emissions are the determining factor for climate change, long-term retention of stored CO2 is important. Long-term \u201cleakage\u201d risks also apply, however, to fossil fuels that are displaced in the short term by nonfossil energy sources (i.e., nuclear, renewables) since the fossil fuels may subsequently be used and the CO2 released to the atmosphere.

Though some full-chain CCUS pilot projects have operated in China, many barriers exist when stepping up to commercial applications, including significant negative perceptions of the environmental risk of CCUS. Therefore, to tailor constructive training or outreach programs for public acceptance of CCUS in China, a large national survey of public perceptions of CCUS technology was conducted in 2013. The questionnaire contained four themes focusing on people with a tertiary education. Six hundred paper\u2013pencil questionnaires were dispatched to 22 universities/enterprises across 19 provinces and 2 municipalities, with a response rate of 95%. The results show that 91.4% of the participants agreed that the earth was experiencing climate change, and 74.3% were interested in low-carbon technologies, but while 22% had heard of CCUS, although with limited knowledge, only 3.6% had a good understanding of the technology. The results from the second part of the questionnaire show that 80.4% of participants believed that CCUS may help to mitigate the impacts of global warming, but the \u201cNot in My Back Yard\u201d (NIMBY) phenomenon was obvious from the location-based objections to transportation and storage processes. In addition, ten listed CCUS environmental management policies received extensive recognition from the participants, and about half of the participants considered that the related government departments should be responsible for environmental management as a first priority. The survey also indicates that the most trusted sources through which the survey participants obtain CCUS information are academic journals and textbooks, television, radio and newspapers, expert lectures and brochures on CCUS demonstration projects.
