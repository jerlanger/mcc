Although infaunal organisms can be expected to be particularly impacted by decreases in seawater pH, as a result of naturally acidified conditions in benthic habitats, information regarding physiological and behavioral responses is still scarce. Determination of PO2 and PCO2 gradients within burrows of the brittlestar Amphiura filiformis during environmental hypercapnia demonstrated that besides hypoxic conditions, increases of environmental PCO2 are additive to the already high PCO2 (up to 0.08 kPa) within the burrows. In response to up to 4 weeks exposure to pH 7.3 (0.3 kPa PCO2) and pH 7.0 (0.6 kPa PCO2), metabolic rates of A. filiformis were significantly reduced in pH 7.0 treatments, accompanied by increased ammonium excretion rates.

Determination of extracellular acid\u2013base status indicated an uncompensated acidosis in CO2-treated animals, which could explain the depressed metabolic rates. Metabolic depression is associated with a retraction of filter feeding arms into sediment burrows. Regeneration of lost arm tissues following traumatic amputation is associated with significant increases in metabolic rate, and hypercapnic conditions (pH 7.0, 0.6 kPa) dramatically reduce the metabolic scope for regeneration, reflected in an 80% reduction in regeneration rate.

After injection, the CO2 will spread and migrate as a buoyant gravity current relative to the denser, ambient brine. Although the CO2 and the brine are immiscible, the impact of capillarity on CO2 spreading and migration is poorly understood. We previously studied the early time evolution of an immiscible gravity current, showing that capillary pressure hysteresis pins a portion of the macroscopic fluid\u2010fluid interface and that this can eventually stop the flow. Here we study the full lifetime of such a gravity current. Using tabletop experiments in packings of glass beads, we show that the horizontal extent of the pinned region grows with time and that this is ultimately responsible for limiting the migration of the current to a finite distance. We also find that capillarity blunts the leading edge of the current, which contributes to further limiting the migration distance. Using experiments in etched micromodels, we show that the thickness of the blunted nose is controlled by the distribution of pore\u2010throat sizes and the strength of capillarity relative to buoyancy.

BECCS's ability to promptly remove CO2 from the atmosphere in a resource efficient manner, whilst being a net energy generator to the global economy, remains controversial. Given the large range of potential outcomes, it is crucial to understand how, if at all, this technology can be deployed in a way which minimises its impact on natural resources and ecosystems, while maximising both carbon removal and power generation. In this study, we present a series of thought experiments, using the Modelling and Optimisation of Negative Emissions Technologies (MONET) framework, to provide insight into the combinations of biomass feedstock, origin, land type, and transport route, to meet a given CO2 removal target. The optimal structure of an international BECCS supply chain was found to vary both quantitatively and qualitatively as the focus shifted from conserving water, land or biomass, to maximising energy generated, with the water use in particular increasing threefold in the land and biomass use minimisation scenario, as compared to the water minimisation scenario. In meeting regional targets, imported biomass was consistently chosen over indigenous biomass in the land and water minimisation scenarios, confirming the dominance of factors such as yield, electricity grid carbon intensity, and precipitation, over transport distance. A pareto-front analysis was performed and, in addition to highlighting the strong trade-offs between BECCS resource efficiency objectives, indicated the potential for tipping points. An analysis of the sensitivity to the availability of marginal land and agricultural residues showed that (1) the availability of agricultural residues had a great impact on BECCS land, and that (2) water use and land use change, two critical sustainability indicators for BECCS, were negatively correlated. Finally, we showed that maximising energy production increased water use and land use fivefold, and land use change by two orders of magnitude. It is therefore likely that an exclusive focus on energy generation and CO2 removal can result in negative consequences for the broader environment. In spite of these strong trade-offs however, it was found that BECCS could meet its electricity production objective without compromising estimated safe land use boundaries. Provided that the right choices are made along BECCS value chain, BECCS can be deployed in a way that both satisfies its resource efficiency and technical performance objectives.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "0c9c0c81fe5901c3d7df6cc5d254553415cbebe3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2626025550", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ERSS.2017.06.010", "CorpusId": 114325822}, "title": "Selling stories of techno-optimism?

The widespread adoption of CCS will require the transportation of the CO2 from where it is captured to where it is to be stored. Pipelines can be expected to play a significant role in the required transportation infrastructure. The transportation of CO2 by long-distance transmission pipeline is established technology; there are examples of CO2 pipelines in USA, Europe and Africa. The required infrastructure for CCS may involve new pipelines and/or the change-of-use of existing pipelines from their current service to CO2 service. Fracture control is concerned with designing a pipeline with a high tolerance to defects introduced during manufacturing, construction and service; and preventing, or minimising the length of, long running fractures. The decompression characteristics of CO2 mean that CO2 pipelines may be more susceptible to long running fractures than hydrocarbon gas pipelines. Long running fractures in CO2 pipelines may be preventable by specifying a line pipe steel toughness that ensures that the \u2018arrest pressure\u2019 is greater than the \u2018saturation pressure\u2019 or by using mechanical crack arrestors. The preferred choice is control through steel toughness because it assures shorter fracture lengths.

It is characterised by high mortality, in part, due to sensitivities to abiotic factors. The impacts of elevated pCO2 and temperature on the physiology and life history of these sensitive life stages are, however, poorly understood. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to investigate the vulnerability of survival, growth, metabolic rate, feeding rate, organic content, and carapace mineralisation of the early benthic juvenile stage of the European lobster Homarus gammarus (L.) to predicted levels of elevated pCO2 [ocean acidification (OA) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) scenarios] and elevated temperature [ocean warming (OW)]. Early benthic juvenile H. gammarus exhibited increased mortality under both OA and CCS conditions at both experimental temperatures, and these mortalities were due to moult death syndrome. There were OA-related reductions in metabolism, food acquisition, and carapace mineral content, while CCS-exposed lobsters exhibited severe shell dissolution. We suggest that disruption of metabolic and calcium homoeostasis is associated with, and possible the cause of, the increased incidence of moult-related mortalities in juvenile lobsters. We conclude that early benthic juvenile lobsters are sensitive, in terms of physiology and life history traits, to both OA and CCS, with OW sometimes mitigating and at other times increasing sensitivities.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "b13a40876ec84d4823f8856c96ade7b0cbb568f3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2996766501", "DOI": "10.1353/eca.2019.0005", "CorpusId": 208284577}, "title": "On the Economics of a Carbon Tax for the United States", "abstract": "Climate change is driven by the buildup of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere, which is predominantly the result of the world\u2019s consumption of fossil fuels. GHGs are a global pollution externality for which a global solution is required. I describe the role a domestic carbon tax could play in reducing U.S. emissions and compare and contrast alternative approaches to reducing our GHG pollution. Carbon taxes have been implemented in 23 jurisdictions around the world. I provide evidence on emission reductions and the economic impact of British Columbia\u2019s carbon tax, a broad-based carbon assessment that has been in effect for over a decade. I also provide an analysis of carbon taxes used in the countries that belong to the European Union. C change is a classic global pollution externality, with billions of polluters creating damage for billions of people. Moreover, the world\u2019s continued use of fossil fuels and other GHG-emitting activities creates damage that will affect future generations. This paper considers the role that a carbon tax could play in the United States as its contribution to reducing emissions. Although climate change is a global problem and the United States has been surpassed by China as the world\u2019s largest emitter, I focus on domestic policy.

This paper argues that a carbon tax should be the central element of U.S. policies to reduce emissions. Putting a price on carbon pollution is a straightforward application of Pigouvian pollution pricing and a textbook response to the market failure arising from pollution. Although a carbon tax is a necessary element in a cost-effective policy approach to pollution, it is not sufficient. Moving to a zero-carbon economy will require new inventions and production processes. And research and development (R&D) will be key to their successful diffusion\u2014whether it is advanced battery storage, carbon capture and storage, or inexpensive, safe, and modular nuclear power. Information and new knowledge are pure public goods that are underprovided in a market economy. The information market failure is a general market failure and not one specific to GHGs. But R&D is central to any solution to the GHG problem, and directed R&D support can ensure that emission reduction targets are met with lower carbon tax rates and the consequent economic costs of the tax, a point made by Daron Acemoglu and others (2012) and by Acemoglu and others (2016). These two market failures\u2014pollution and the pure public goods nature of R&D\u2014should drive our choice of policy. In section V, I discuss other policy needs to complement the carbon tax and energy-related R&D.

This solution involves the combined application of carbon capture and storage (CCS) from power generation and other industrial facilities with CO2-EOR, which can provide the additional beneficial use of CO2 injection for increasing crude oil production. On the other hand, some believe that increased oil production from CO2-EOR is not an acceptable option for mitigating GHG emissions. This study provides information on the opportunities for and potential benefits from increasing CO2 storage associated with CO2-EOR, to attempt to address the current lack of narrative in the international policy landscape around this issue. This study starts with a review of traditional approaches for CO2-EOR; these approaches have tended to optimize oil production efficiency, often by limiting the volume of CO2 injected. This is contrasted with potential alternative approaches that optimize both oil production and CO2 storage. Existing CO2-EOR operations are described, highlighting those projects pursuing or considering the co-benefits of CO2 storage and incremental oil production. Expanding on previous work, the worldwide incremental oil production and CO2 storage potential from CO2-EOR is assessed assuming the application of \" next generation \" CO2-EOR technologies. Other \" second generation \" approaches to increase CO2 storage in conjunction with CO2-EOR are also identified and evaluated. Finally, life-cycle analyses are presented of the GHG emissions associated with various alternatives for CO2-EOR development in combination with CO2 storage. The key findings of this study are summarized below. CO2-EOR has been demonstrated to be profitable in commercial scale applications for nearly 30 years. The bulk of the global application of CO2-EOR comes from the Permian Basin of West Texas in the United States, which accounts for two-thirds of the world's oil production from CO2-EOR projects. CO2-EOR has been deployed extensively in this basin since the 1980s. CO2-EOR projects in the basin are largely injecting CO2 obtained from natural CO2 reservoirs; which provide CO2 of high purity and that is readily available at low cost. An extensive CO2 pipeline network has evolved to meet the CO2 requirements of these projects. Anthropogenic sources, though currently accounting for a relatively small portion of CO2 supply to CO2-EOR projects, are steadily increasing, and are contributing greater volumes and a higher proportion of the CO2 supplied for CO2-EOR.

Chemical looping combustion (CLC) with biomass can be considered as a promising BECCS technology since CLC has low cost and energy penalty. In CLC, the oxygen needed for combustion is supplied by a solid oxygen carrier circulating between the fuel and air reactors. In the fuel reactor, the fuel is oxidized producing a CO2-concentrated stream while the oxygen carrier is reduced. In the air reactor, the oxygen carrier is regenerated with air. Chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU) is a CLC technology that allows the combustion of solid fuels as in common combustion with air by means of an oxygen carrier that release gaseous oxygen in the fuel reactor. In the last years, several Cu-based, Mn-based, and mixed oxide oxygen (O2) carriers have been tested showing good CLOU properties. Among them, copper (Cu)-based and Cu-Manganese (Mn) mixed oxides showed high reactivity, O2 release rate, and high O2 equilibrium concentration. The aim of this work is to study the viability of biomass combustion by CLOU process. The combustion of three types of biomass (pine sawdust, olive stone, and almond shell) were studied in a continuous 1.5 kWth CLC unit. Two O2 carriers were tested: a Cu-based oxygen carrier with Magnesium, Aluminum, Oxgen (MgAl2O4) as an inert prepared by spray drying (Cu60MgAl) and a mixed Cu-Mn oxide prepared by spray granulation (Cu34Mn66). These materials are capable of releasing gaseous oxygen when they are reduced in a different range of temperatures. CO2 capture and combustion efficiency were evaluated.

High CO2 capture efficiencies and 100% combustion efficiency were reached with both oxygen carriers and with all the biomasses tested.

In a first set of pathways, the timing of emission reductions is such that over the 2010\u20132100 period, assuming full participation from 2013 onwards, mitigation costs are minimized. In a second set of pathways, we set emissions in 2020 at a level based on the pledges of the Copenhagen Accord. In the \u2018Copenhagen Potential\u2019 scenario, climate talks result in satisfying conditions linked by countries to their \u2018most ambitious\u2019 proposals.

The implementation of carbon capture comes with a considerable investment cost and a significant effect on the plants operating cost, which both depend on site conditions, mainly due to differences in flue gas flow and composition and depending on the availability of excess heat that can be utilized to power the capture unit. In this study we map the costs required to install and operate amine-based post-combustion CO2 capture at all manufacturing plants in Sweden with annual emissions of 500 kt CO2 or more, of both fossil and of biogenic origin, of which there are 28 plants (including a petrochemical site, refineries, iron and steel plants, cement plants and pulp and paper mills). The work considers differences in the investment required as well as differences in potential for using excess heat to cover the steam demand of the capture process. We present the resulting total CO2 capture costs in the form of a marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) for the emission sources investigated. Cost estimations for a transport and storage system are also indicated. The MACC shows that CO2 capture applied to 28 industrial units capture CO2 emissions corresponding to more than 50% of Swedish total CO2 emissions (from all sectors) at a cost ranging from around 40 \u20ac/t CO2 to 110 \u20ac/t CO2, depending on emission source.

Individual modules describe ecosystems processes, including vegetation resource competition and production, tissue turnover, growth, fire and mortality, soil and litter biogeochemistry, including the effects of CO2 on these processes. The model simulates realistic post-disturbance succession in different environments. Seasonal exchange of H2O and CO2 between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere is modelled in reasonable agreement with observation. Global estimates of carbon stocks in soil, litter and vegetation are within their acceptable ranges and the model captures the present-day patterns in vegetation. Fire return intervals are simulated correctly in most regions. Results emphasise the important role of the terrestrial biosphere in both the seasonal cycle and in the inter-annual variability in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2. LPJ successfully reproduced both the amplitude and phase of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 content as measured at a global network of monitoring stations. The model predicted a small net terrestrial biosphere uptake of CO2 during the 1980's with a strong CO2 fertilisation effect, which enhances plant production, reduced by the effects of climate and land use change. Historical land use change and CO2 fertilisation have been the dominant, albeit opposing factors governing the response of the terrestrial biosphere with respect to carbon storage during the 20th century. LPJ is run using one future climate and atmospheric CO2 scenario until 2200. Enhanced production due to the CO2 fertilisation effect eventually reaches an asymptote, and consequently the ability of the terrestrial biosphere to store additional carbon diminishes. At the end of the forcing period, vegetation is no longer in equilibrium, justifying the need for dynamic models in global change research.

Overall, the system carries out the same job of a conventional combustor, with the fundamental advantage of segregating the oxidation products (CO2 and H2 O) into an output flow free of nitrogen and excess oxygen. The flow exiting the reduction reactor consists of water and CO2 , the latter readily available for liquefaction, transport and long-term storage. The hot, vitiated air from the oxidation reactor is the means to produce power through a thermodynamic cycle.

However, MOF particles are usually difficult to be processed into application-specific devices because of their brittleness, insolubility, difficulty in molding, and low compatibility with other materials. It is an urgent need to shape MOF nanocrystals into various useful configurations by developing effective fabrication methods. Specifically, versatile functional MOF films with robustness and operation flexibility are highly desired. Although an increasing number of MOF films and their diverse applications have been demonstrated, this field is still at an emerging stage with challenging issues. In this Account, we describe our recent research progress on controllable synthesis of MOF films, highlighting postsynthetic polymerization, in situ interweaving, and solvent-free hot-pressing methods. Basically, two main synthesis concepts are involved, including incorporation of the performed MOF particles into polymer matrix and in situ growth of MOF coatings on surface. In MOF/polymer hybrid films, MOF nanocrystals were covalently linked by flexible polymer chains via graft copolymerization, interconnected by functional polymer chains via in situ polymerization, or adhered to polymer matrix via specific interactions at interface, consequently leading to a molecular-level homogeneous membrane or functional coating layer or foam. In these examples, the existence of polymer endows MOF films with favorable features of processability and flexibility, along with new functions. Moreover, we developed an in situ solvent-free hot-pressing method as a general approach for efficient fabrication of MOF coatings on various commercial substrates (e.g., cloth and metal foils), where metal ions or ligands were chemically bonded to the surface functional groups or metal sites at the early stage of nucleation and subsequently assembled into continuous, uniform, and stable MOF layers under confined conditions. We further extended it to a scalable manufacturing method, roll-to-roll production. MOF films severing as filters (MOFilters) have significant applications in air and water purification. They show high and stable performance in PM capture along with a low pressure drop, holding promise of application in both industrial and residential environments. Moreover, MOFilters can remove SO2 and O3 from air by adsorption and catalytic decomposition, respectively.

Much work has been done to characterize PyC on landforms and in soils where it originates or in \u201cterminal\u201d reservoirs such as marine sediments. Less is known about intermediate reservoirs such as streams and rivers, and few studies have characterized hillslope and in-stream erosion control structures (ECS) designed to capture soils and sediments destabilized by wildfire. In this preliminary study, organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (N), and stable isotope parameters, \u03b413C and \u03b415N, were compared to assess opportunities for carbon and nitrogen sequestration in postwildfire sediments (fluvents) deposited upgradient of ECS in ephemeral- and intermittent-stream channels. The variability of OC, N, \u03b413C, and \u03b415N were analyzed in conjunction with fire history, age of captured sediments, topographic position, and land cover. Comparison of samples in 2 watersheds indicates higher OC and N in ECS with more recently captured sediments located downstream of areas with higher burn severity. This is likely a consequence of (1) higher burn severity causing greater runoff, erosion, and transport of OC (organic matter) to ECS and (2) greater cumulative loss of OC and N in older sediments stored behind older ECS. In addition, C/N, \u03b413C, and \u03b415N results suggest that organic matter in sediments stored at older ECS are enriched in microbially processed biomass relative to those at newer ECS. We conservatively estimated the potential mean annual capture of OC by ECS, using values from the watershed with lower levels of OC, to be 3 to 4 metric tons, with a total potential storage of 293 to 368 metric tons in a watershed of 7.7\u2009km2 and total area of 2000 ECS estimated at 2.6\u2009ha (203-255 metric tons/ha).

Area of Porous Materials: Understanding Theoretical Limits", "abstract": "Surface area is one of the principle characteristics of a porous material, directly related to its performance in a physisorption application, such as CO 2 capture and methane storage. In this article we apply computational tools to establish a theoretical limit of the accessible surface area in porous structures. This analysis is based on the notion that the surface area of low den-sity porous materials is governed by the properties of molecular fragments constituting their structure. For both crystalline and disordered structures the theoretical limit of the surface area is estimated at about 15000 m 2 /g. A substantial research effort over the last 20 years went into search and development of materials with high surface areas. Key developments in this \ufb01 eld have been recently reviewed in an excellent article by Holst and Cooper. [ 1 ] In this review, examples are drawn from polymer chemistry, with several types of materials featuring surface areas as high as 1000 m 2 /g, activated carbons, represented by structures such as Maxsorb with the surface area in excess of 3000 m 2 /g, [ 2 ] porous organic molecules [ 3 , 4 ] and other families of materials. A number of impressive results are associated with the development of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). [ 5 ] In these crystalline materials, metal complexes form vertices of the structure, connected by organic linkers. This architecture allows one, through selection of appropriate linkers, to create extremely sparse materials with record low crystal densities ( < 0.25 g/cm 3 ) and ultrahigh surface areas ( > 6000 m 2 /g).", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "87a491739d773ade8b3ca9da0c27c3038bfa2480", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2047358805", "DOI": "10.2516/OGST/2012104", "CorpusId": 110338711}, "title": "CO2 Capture Cost Reduction: Use of a Multiscale Simulations Strategy for a Multiscale Issue", "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one important option for CO2 mitigation (International Energy Agency, 2009) . Post-combustion capture processes using amines are considered one of the preferred options for CCS. However, the cost of avoided CO2 is very large and must be reduced. The present article aims to show that combining different simulation tools used on different scales makes possible afine analysis of CO2 capture costs and the associatedparameters responsible for these costs on different scales. It is first shown, from a macro-scale techno-economic analysis, that investments represent about one half of the total CO2 cost. Focusing on this cost, a sensitivity analysis, via Aspen calculations performed on a meso-column scale, enables one to identify key mass-transfer parameters that control absorption column design. It is shown that the most important mass-transfer parameter is the interfacial area, the gas and liquid mass transfer coefficients having almost no influence. Finally, from CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics ) simulations performed both on a large and on a local scale, some insights are given in order to optimize column design, first via the determination of large-scale distributor/packed bed interactions, and second via the determination of local pressure drop or local mass transfer parameters. It is also discussed how simulations should be performed on different scales in a two-way coupling approach in order to ensure fruitful results in the development of new technologies and further in CO2 capture cost reduction.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "bbafa73d7a5e303e39c9a33fc25749f6d4b5df3d", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s10098-021-02025-y", "CorpusId": 231671737}, "title": "Policy incentives in carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) investment based on real options analysis", "abstract": "Carbon capture, carbon utilization and storage (CCUS) technology is an important potential technical support for coal power plants to maintain existing production structure while simultaneously achieving near-zero carbon emissions with the current energy structure in China being dominated by coal. However, CCUS technology is still at the early demonstration stage, and there are many uncertainties in the carbon trading market, technology and policy incentives that the traditional method is no longer able to handle. Based on the binomial tree real option model, this paper establishes a CCUS technology investment evaluation model that incorporates the uncertainties with carbon price, government subsidy, technological progress and carbon dioxide utilization ratios into the model, and investigates the influence of government incentive on CCUS technology investment in two scenarios in China. The numerical results in case study show that (1) If the subsidy is too low, no matter how high the lower limit of carbon price is set, enterprises will not invest. (2) When the proportion of government subsidy exceeds 0.33, a specific and accurate minimum carbon price is given to promote coal-fired plants immediate investment in CCUS technology based on the model. (3) Only the government subsidies cannot stimulate CCUS investment at this demonstration stage.

We also investigated the prospect of major coal consumers joining the PPCA by systematically comparing members to non-members. PPCA members extract and use less coal and have older power plants, but this alone does not fully explain their pledges to phase out coal power. The members of the alliance are also wealthier and have more transparent and independent governments. Thus, what sets them aside from major coal consumers, such as China and India, are both lower costs of coal phase-out and a higher capacity to bear these costs.To limit warming, a rapid reduction in coal use is needed.

Recent GHG emission trends are consistent with worst-case scenarios of the previous decade. Dramatic and near-term emission reductions likely will be needed to ameliorate the potential deleterious impacts of climate change. To achieve such reductions, fundamental changes are required in the way that energy is generated and used. New technologies must be developed and deployed at a rapid rate. Advances in carbon capture and storage, renewable, nuclear, and transportation technologies are particularly important; however, global research and development efforts related to these technologies currently appear to fall short relative to needs. Even with a proactive and international mitigation effort, humanity will need to adapt to climate change, but the adaptation needs and damages will be far greater if mitigation activities are not pursued in earnest. In this review, research is highlighted that indicates increasing global and regional temperatures and ties climate changes to increasing GHG emissions. GHG mitigation targets necessary for limiting future global temperature increases are discussed, including how factors such as population growth and the growing energy intensity of the developing world will make these reduction targets more challenging. Potential technological pathways for meeting emission reduction targets are examined, barriers are discussed, and global and U.S. modeling results are presented that suggest that the necessary pathways will require radically transformed electric and mobile sectors. While geoengineering options have been proposed to allow more time for serious emission reductions, these measures are at the conceptual stage with many unanswered cost, environmental, and political issues.

We evaluate data from surveys given since 2015 to UNFCCC delegates at the Conference of the Parties (COPs) to ascertain how attitudes about bioenergy, BECCS, and CCS may be changing within the UNFCCC. The results show a positive change in attitudes over time for both fossil CCS and BECCS.

Thus, there is a need to identify the key factors affecting the climate effects of natural gas versus coal electricity production, and to present these climate effects in as clear and transparent a way as possible. Here, we identify power plant efficiencies and methane leakage rates as the factors that explain most of the variance in greenhouse gas emissions by natural gas and coal power plants. Thus, we focus on the role of these factors in determining the relative merits of natural gas versus coal power plants. We develop a simple model estimating CO2 and CH4 emissions from natural gas and coal power plants, and resulting temperature change. Simple underlying physical changes can be obscured by abstract evaluation metrics, thus we focus our analysis on the time evolution of global mean temperature. We find that, during the period of plant operation, if there is substantial methane leakage, natural gas plants can produce greater near-term warming than coal plants with the same power output. However, if methane leakage rates are low and power plant efficiency is high, natural gas plants can produce some reduction in near-term warming. In the long term, natural gas power plants produce less warming than would occur with coal power plants. However, without carbon capture and storage natural gas power plants cannot achieve the deep reductions that would be required to avoid substantial contribution to additional global warming.

The technology involves the capture of carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power stations and other point sources, compression of the CO2 into a fluid, transporting it and injecting it deep beneath the Earth's surface into depleted petroleum reservoirs and other porous formations. Once injected, the CO2 must be monitored to ensure that it is emplaced and assimilated as planned and that none leaks back to surface. A variety of methods have been deployed to monitor the CO2 storage site and many such methods have been adapted from oilfield practice. However, such methods are commonly indirect, episodic, require active signal generation and remain expensive throughout the monitoring period that may last for hundreds of years. A modelling framework was developed to concurrently simulate CO2 geostorage conditions and background cosmic-ray muon tomography, in which the potential was assessed for using variations in muon attenuation, due to changes in CO2 abundance, as a means of CO2 detection. From this, we developed a passive, continuous monitoring method for CO2 storage sites using muon tomography, the tools for which can be deployed during the active drilling phase (development) of the storage site. To do this, it was necessary to develop a muon detector that could be used in the hostile environment (saline, high temperature) of the well bore. A prototype detector has been built and tested at the 1.1\u2009km deep Boulby potash mine on the northeast coast of England, supported by the existing STFC Boulby Underground Laboratory on the site. The detector is now ready to be commercialized.

On the theory side, we show that, while standard density functional theory is not capable of correctly describing van der Waals interactions, functionals especially designed to include van der Waals forces exist, yielding results in remarkable agreement with experiment.

Three primary options are being considered for large-scale storage of CO2 in subsurface formations: oil and gas reservoirs, deep saline aquifers, and coal beds. There are very many large saline aquifers around the world, which could make a big contribution to mitigating global warming. However, we have much less understanding of saline aquifers than oil and gas reservoirs. Several mechanisms are involved in the storage of CO2 in deep saline aquifers, but the ultimate goal of injection of CO2 into the aquifers containing salt water is to dissolve the CO2 in the water. So it is important to study the solubility trapping and sensitivity factors of CO2 in saline aquifers. This paper presents results of modeling CO2 storage in a saline aquifer using the commercial reservoir simulator ECLIPSE. The objective of this study was to better understand the CO2/brine phase behavior (PVT properties) and quantitatively estimate the most important CO2 storage mechanism in brine-solubility trapping. This would provide a tool by performing theoretical and numerical studies that help to understand the feasibility of CO2 geological storage. A 3-dimensional, 2-phase (water/gas) conceptional reservoir model used finite, homogenous and isothermal formations into which CO2 is injected at a constant rate. The effects of main parameters were studied, including the vertical to horizontal permeability ratio kv/kh, salinity, and residual phase saturations. The results show that the vertical to horizontal permeability ratio has a significant effect on CO2 storage.

The process aims to overcome the limiting factors of other negative emission technologies (cost and energy requirements, potential competition for land and freshwater) while simultaneously addressing the problem of ocean acidification. The overall proposed process is based on the following: (a) a gasifier where the biomass is converted to syngas; (b) a thermal steam reformer working at high temperature where the hydrocarbons and tar oils are converted to hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO); (c) a kiln to produce Ca(OH)2 (slaked lime) from limestone by using the enthalpy of the hot syngas; (d) the spreading, by means of vessels, of the slaked lime into the seawater to achieve ocean liming; (e) the delivery of syngas to a water gas shift reactor producing CO2 and H2 that are then separated; (f) the final storage of all CO2 produced in the process; (g) the use of H2, being the valuable by-product of the whole process, for decarbonized energy production as well as for ammonia synthesis, offsetting part of the production cost, thus generating \u201clow-cost\u201d negative emissions.

A preliminary cost analysis resulted in an average levelized cost of 98 $ per ton of CO2 removed; when considering the revenues from the produced energy, the cost falls to 64 $/tCO2. The higher efficiency in carbon removal obtained allows to reduce the amount of biomass required by BECCS (bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) to achieve negative emissions, and thanks to the valuable H2 produced it lowers the costs of CO2 removal from the atmosphere.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "d77dab661abfee335b99f977d4bfd340fd5794c4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1864035268", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.1911846", "CorpusId": 3763738}, "title": "What About Coal?
