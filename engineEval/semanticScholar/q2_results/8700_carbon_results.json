Indeed, given the lacking capacity storage of batteries, electricity production has to become more flexible to keep demand and production balanced. Micro Gas Turbines (mGTs) are good candidates to provide this necessary flexibility. Still, their carbon footprint has to be reduced (and even become zero) to move towards a carbon-clean power production in 2050. The application of post-combustion Carbon Capture (CC) offers a solution to remove CO2 from mGT flue gases. Applying a conventional CC process with monoethanolamine (MEA) to mGT has already been numerically investigated in previous work \uf05b\uf031\uf05d. Results highlighted however the strong negative impact of applying CC on mGT performances: 7.9 absolute% decrease in electric efficiency, mainly due to the high energy requirement for the CC process. Indeed, compared to coal or large-scale gas turbines power plants, applying CC to mGTs is more disadvantageous because of the low CO2 content of their flue gases: 1.5 vol.% or still below 5%, even when Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is applied. Therefore, the energy consumption of the CC plant must be reduced to make carbon clean mGT more efficient and profitable. Next to a better integration of the different mGT and CC heat streams [2], the selection of the appropriate solvent and process configuration will help reducing the energy penalty: for instance, the use of a promising blend of methyldiethanolamine with piperazine (MDEA/PZ) as solvent is investigated in this work. The benefit of using the MDEA/PZ blend instead of the conventional MEA solvent for removing CO2 has already been shown in coal-fired power plant or cement plant flue gases [3,4], yet, no study has been carried out on application with a specific low CO2 content, as those found in mGT flue gases. Next to the careful selection of the solvent, further reduction in CC energy consumption can be achieved by improving the process configuration. The absorber intercooling configuration has proven to be more efficient for coalfired or cement plants applications but has not been investigated for low CO2 content flue gases.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "38a890ea3f01700d4d8462e302941556b1d71058", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 199424989}, "title": "THERMO-HYDRAULIC COUPLED SIMULATION OF IMMISCIBLE CO 2 FLOODING", "abstract": "As an efficient way to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere and to extract more hydrocarbons from reservoir, CO2 flooding is important to reduce environmental and ecological damage by traditional energy. Study on performance of CO2 in the reservoir and its impact on formation fluids is necessary to oil recovery and to further carbon capture and storage (CCS). In practical, CO2 is injected into reservoir at low temperature, and both field tests and predictions show that temperature of CO2 would be lower than that of reservoir while it reaches the target formation, especially for high injection rate. Therefore, further estimation should be conducted to predict how reservoir temperature and properties of fluids are changed during cold CO2 flooding. In this paper, a mathematical model for non-isothermal immiscible CO2 flooding is firstly established, then full thermo-hydraulic coupling of the model is simulated on COMSOL by introducing several temperature-dependent and pressure-dependent physical properties of CO2, oil and rock. The basic reservoir parameters of the model are obtained from one block of Daqing Oilfield, China. Furtherly, effect of CO2 injection temperature, of CO2 injection rate and of injector shut-in on reservoir performance is studied. Results show that injection of colder CO2 causes rapid reduction in reservoir temperature near the injector at the earlier stage. Effect of temperature change is timely shown on physical properties of fluids for full thermo-hydraulic coupling. Oil production rate, oil recovery and production gas-oil ratio all increase as injection temperature increases. Based on a practical situation, this study gives an insight into reservoir performance during cold CO2 flooding with a numerical method, and it can provide some support for study on temperature change in the reservoir.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "fb6295d13bd944725914c070aa2fb6a920e9568a", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 211199654}, "title": "Deep Decarbonisation of Materials Processing Industries: Presentation of the four panels", "abstract": "The importance of industry sector greenhouse gas emissions is often underestimated.

The production of aviation fuels need to have a low overall CO2 life cycle emission profile (a 20% reduction from the petroleum-based fuel baseline), and, most importantly, meet the demanding fuel specifications required for aviation fuels. Synthetic fuels have been produced commercially via the Fischer-Tropsch process for several years using fossil based feedstock (e.g., coal, lignite). The products, as either blended drop-in or totally synthetic fuel, have been tested and shown to have properties meeting oil specifications when used as an aviation fuel for both civil and military aircraft. The goal for this research was to assess the technical viability of producing drop-in aviation biofuels from co-mingled fossil and carbonaceous feedstock using the CE-CERT process. The CE-CERT process has been shown to have higher efficiency than conventional gasification technologies when used with non-sustainable feedstock. A model of the whole production process has been built using the Aspen Plus process modeling software. Life cycle analyses (LCA) using a modified GREET model were then conducted based on the results of the process modeling. It is found that using biosolid as the sustainable portion of the feedstock, with additional carbon capture and storage (CCS), the CE-CERT process combined with synthetic aviation fuel production processes results in high fuel conversion efficiencies and very low GHG emissions. Biosolid mass percentage in feedstock should be higher than 17% to meet the GHG reduction goal. To have zero emission in the well-to-tank (WTT) process, biosolid mass percentage should be no higher than 23%. High biosolid mass percentage is not suggested for the process.

These are:\n Carbon negative operations - Effective, large scale, affordable carbon capture and storage solutions are essential to meet global emissions targets. TechX Ventures seeks to create new technologies that will allow the capture of carbon at source, safe storage and conversion to other useful products such as graphene and hydrogen.\n Automated oil and gas - Oil and gas is playing catch-up with other industries, such as automotive and aerospace, when it comes to adopting robotics, automation and artificial intelligence. TechX Ventures aims to apply recent advances in these areas to North Sea operations to improve safety, enhance production efficiency and automate the decommissioning process.\n Energy movement/storage - Extracting, transporting, storing and using oil and gas presents many challenges.

A large part of the increase can be contributed to use of fossil fuels for energy production. To reduce CO2 emissions, more and more capacity of renewable energy sources such as, wind power, solar PV and hydro-power are installed. However, most of these sources result in intermittent supply of electricity leading to a mismatch in supply and demand. To level supply and demand, storage of electricity is required. In this thesis, the storage of renewable electricity into methanol is studied. The goal of thesis is to develop technology for direct air capture of and improve efficiency of -- small scale -- CO2 to methanol technology. Technologies for conversion of H2O into H2 -- required for the synthesis of methanol -- are outside the scope of this project. In Chapter 1 it is shown that for long term and large scale storage (i.e. seasonal storage), storage in chemicals is required. Methanol is liquid at ambient conditions and therefore an excellent storage medium, as it is easy to store and transport. Moreover, it can be produced from the abundant available chemicals CO2 and H2O. Furthermore, methanol is a very flexible product as it can be converted back to electricity, used as a gasoline substituent, converted to a diesel replacement and used as feedstock in the chemical industry. To produce the CO2 required for the production of methanol, the transport phenomena for CO2 adsorption in solid amine sorbents are studied in Chapter 2. The adsorption kinetics are determine to be able to optimize CO2 air capture systems. For this, a new experimental method is developed to exclude heat and mass transfer limitations during kinetic adsorption experiments. Hereto, a novel contactor was designed and good process control, working with pure CO2 and small particle diameters enabled the measurement of intrinsic kinetics. A mathematical model describing convection, diffusion and reaction rate inside a particle confirmed the absence of mass and heat transfer limitations in the experiments. During normal adsorption conditions however, the uptake rate of CO2 will be strongly inhibited by diffusional resistances inside the particle.Linear driving force and Toth-isotherm reaction rate equations are evaluated for the CO2 adsorption process studied. The results show that the experimental particle loading with time could not be described by the linear driving force models. On the other hand, the Toth reaction rate equation, consistent with the Toth isotherm to describe the adsorption equilibrium, showed a very good fit to the experimental data. This shows that a rate based isotherm equation is necessary for consistent prediction of both, adsorption rate and equilibrium loading. In Chapter 3 and 4 the desorption of CO2 from the adsorbent is studied. While Chapter 3 focuses on the regeneration of sorbents, Chapter 4 focuses on the production of high purity CO2 from air. In Chapter 3 the regeneration conditions of a solid amine sorbent are evaluated by experiments and equilibrium modelling. It was found that when using an inert purge flow the desorption rate is strongly influenced by equilibrium between the gas and adsorbed phase. Because of the strong dependency of the isotherm on temperature, heat transfer is found to be an important design parameter. With elevated temperature (>80\u00b0C) both the working capacity and the productivity increase significantly. Therefore, most important design considerations are heat transfer and the trade-off between sorbent working capacity and energy consumption for sorbent heating. The effects of water co-adsorption and steam purge on the CO2 working capacity and energy requirement for CO2 desorption are reported in Chapter 4. Working capacities are studied by fixed bed operation for changing temperature, pressure and amount of steam purge. Results show that for pressure-temperature swing adsorption a temperature above 100\u00b0C and a pressure below 200 mbar as desorption conditions are required to maximize CO2 working capacity and reduce energy requirement for desorption. Co-adsorption of water reduces energy requirement due to an increased CO2 working capacity. Application of a steam purge increases the CO2 working capacity and hence reduces sorbent inventory required. However, the net energy requirement per kilogram CO2 does not decrease due to the latent heat of water. Concluding, steam purge regeneration for air capture does not reduce OpEx but might reduce CapEx. A novel reactor concept for the conversion of CO2 and H2 to methanol is developed in Chapter 5. Conversion limitations because of thermodynamic equilibrium are bypassed via in situ condensation of a water/methanol mixture. Two temperatures zones inside the reactor ensure optimal catalyst temperature, automatic gas circulation by natural convection and full conversion by condensation at a lower temperature in a separate zone. Experimental work confirmed full carbon conversion (>99.5%) and high methanol selectivity (>99.5% on carbon basis). Because of full gas conversion there is no need for an external recycle of unconverted reactants. Moreover, proof of concept for operation under natural convection conditions was shown. A more detailed analysis of the condensing reactor for conversion of CO2 to methanol is given in Chapter 6. The reactor is characterized under forced convective conditions, both experimentally and by modelling. The goal of the study is to optimize the operation conditions and identify limitations of the reactor concept. Experimental results show that the productivity is limited by reaction equilibrium and mass transport at high temperature (> 250\u00b0C), while reaction kinetics limit productivity at low temperature (> 220\u00b0C). Further analysis of the LOGIC concept is performed by an adiabatic 1D-reactor model in combination with an equilibrium flash condenser model. To enable autothermal operation without excessive heat exchange area, it was found that a condenser temperature below 70\u00b0C is required. Most important design parameter is found to be the conversion per pass over the catalyst bed. Increasing dimensions of the catalyst section will increase the conversion per pass, unless equilibrium is reached. On the other hand, heat exchanger and condenser area are reduced because of a lower recycle ratio. With the model developed, overall reactor performance can be optimized by finding the most optimal combination of reaction and condenser conditions. In Chapter 7 a 100MW wind power to methanol process has been evaluated to determine the capital requirement and power to methanol efficiency. Power available for electrolysis determines the amount of hydrogen produced. The stoichiometric amount, for the methanol synthesis, of CO2 is produced using direct air capture. Capital cost for all process steps is estimated using short-cut equipment sizing and economics. Power to methanol efficiency was determined to be around 50%. The cost of methanol is around 800\u20ac ton-1 including wind turbine capital cost. Excluding 300M\u20acinvestment cost for 100MW of wind turbines, total plant capital cost is around 200M\u20ac. About 45% of the capital cost is reserved for electrolysers, 50% for the CO2 air capture installation, and 5% for the methanol synthesis system. The conceptual design and evaluation shows that renewable Methanol from CO2 from air, water and renewable electricity is becoming a realistic option at reasonable costs of 750-800 \u20ac ton-1. The production of renewable methanol using direct air capture and electrolysis is currently not economical viable. As discussed in Chapter 7 the cost of wind energy, electrolysis, and air capture are expected to go down in the future, improving process economics. As discussed in Chapter 8, government legislation might be an important driver for the process. For example, the European Renewable Energy Directive II) requires 14% of renewable energy to be used in transportation by 2030. Moreover, the European Commission proposes a climate-neutral Europe in 2050, thereby renewable methanol could fulfil the role of sustainable carbon source for the chemical industry.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "a4a110469c1e33b5f45cf7abb296eb8f0f3df56a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2566721183", "DOI": "10.1109/APPEEC.2016.7779726", "CorpusId": 27835543}, "title": "Low-Carbon Economic Dispatch considering carbon capture unit and demand response under carbon trading", "abstract": "The power system needs to coordinate the economic dispatch and the carbon emission under the carbon market.

Among the GHGs, CO2 is the most dominant gas, compared to methane and nitrous oxide. It accounts for about 50% of the total warming effect of all climate impact gases. One promising technology to reduce the CO2 level in the atmosphere is carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), which consists of capturing CO2 emissions from power plants and industrial sources and sequestering them in deep geologic formations for long periods of time. Carbon sequestration and storage in soils provide an important mean of decreasing GHGs in the atmosphere to mitigate predicted climate changes. Over one third of arable land is in agriculture globally and this will be a major component of using soils as a sink. The carbon sink capacity of the world\u2019s agricultural and degraded soils is 50 to 66% of the historic carbon loss of 42 to 78 gigatons (Gt) of carbon. An increase of 1 ton of soil carbon pool of degraded cropland soils may increase crop yield by 20-40 kg/ha for wheat, 10-20 kg/ha for maize, and 0.5-1 kg/ha for cowpea. As well as enhancing food security, carbon sequestration has the potential to offset fossil fuel emissions by 0.4 to 1.2 Gt of carbon per year, or 5 to 15% of the global fossil-fuel emissions.

During anesthesia, rectal temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and pulse oximetry derived hemoglobin oxygen saturation were recorded. Arterial blood samples were collected and immediately analyzed for evaluation of pulmonary gas exchange, acid\u2013base status, and selected hematologic and plasma variables. At the end of anesthesia, atipamezole was administered intramuscularly at five times the medetomidine dose. Capture-induced hyperthermia and lactic acidemia were documented in free-ranging bears. Hypoxemia during anesthesia was documented in both free-ranging and captive bears. In free-ranging bears, rectal temperature, heart rate, lactate, hematocrit, and hemoglobin decreased significantly during anesthesia, whereas partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide, pH, potassium, and glucose increased. Yearlings had a significantly higher heart rate, pH, base excess, bicarbonate, and glucose, and had a significantly lower rectal temperature, sodium, hematocrit, and hemoglobin when compared with subadult and adult brown bears. In conclusion, alterations in pulmonary gas exchange and acid\u2013base status in brown bears during anesthesia with medetomidine\u2013zolazepam\u2013tiletamine with the doses and capture methods used in this study were identified.

SEWGS involves the capture of CO2 in a sorbent material during the water-gas shift reaction, effectively shifting the equilibrium to higher hydrogen yields (due to Le Ch&acirc;telier&rsquo;s principle). A pure CO2 stream, which is obtained during sorbent regeneration with steam and further steam condensation, can be used directly for carbon storage. Hydrotalcite-based adsorbents have been investigated as possible candidates for the adsorption of CO2 at elevated temperatures and pressures due to their high stability, fast adsorption/desorption kinetics and high CO2 capacity. However, there is still lack of understanding of the interactions between small gas molecules such as H2O, CO2 and H2S and the adsorbent. It has been reported in the literature that steam enhances the CO2 sorption capacity of hydrotalcite-based adsorbents. A comprehensive experimental investigation on the ability of these adsorbents to adsorb steam and detailed knowledge on the interactions between H2O and CO2 in a mixed sorption system, are still lacking in the literature. This study focuses on the influence of water vapor on the sorption kinetics and capacity of hydrotalcites. Isotherms for CO2, H2O and a mixture of CO2 and H2O, have been measured at 400 &deg;C for three different materials. Two potassium promoted hydrotalcite-based adsorbents, with different Mg/Al-ratio (Sasol Germany) and potassium promoted &gamma;-alumina have been investigated to study the influence of the material composition on the sorption properties. We have developed a dedicated Thermogravimetric (TGA) setup to study the adsorption of the gases CO2, H2S and H2O on hydrotalcite-based adsorbents up to 10 bar pressure at elevated temperatures. Five consecutive adsorption &ndash;desorption cycles have been found to be sufficient to determine the cyclic adsorption capacity at a certain partial pressure of the reactant gas. The isotherms have been determined in a pressure range from 0 to 8 bar. Based on the adsorption isotherms for the individual gases and their mixtures, the adsorption properties of various HTC materials will be discussed and compared in terms of composition, adsorption sites and sorption kinetics.

High consumption of fossil fuels, relentless pursuit for economic development has generated excessive increase of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly of carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon capture and geological storage is an alternative to mitigate CO2 emissions at industrial scale. This work aims to study the influence of salinity aqueous phase using CO2 in supercritical state on change of physical, chemical, and mineralogical parameters of sandstone reservoir rock, representative of the Furnas Formation in Parana (PR) State, Brazil, in conditions of geological storage. Experiments were performed about 15 days in stainless steel batch reactors AISI 304 subjected to pressure and constant temperature (120 bar and 75 C), similar to those found in geological formations. In parallel, PHREEQCv3.0 code was used to simulate the geological interactions Rock-CO2-Saline solution equilibrium. Characterization of solid was performed with Microscopy in Binocular Loupe, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) and, the aqueous phase was by ICP-OES, for analysis of cations and Ion Chomatography (IC) for analysis of anions. Those techniques converged to the same results where quartz, kaolinite and illite were found as primary mineral in abundance of mineralogical composition of the Furnas rock. Globally, the Furnas sample is not so reactive in the presence of CO2, milli-Q water and saline solution in geological storage conditions. However, partial dissolution of illite and reprecipitation of kaolinite and silica were identified at the lab scale. These results were confirmed by numerical simulations.

Questionnaires were analyzed using the Software Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The study findings reveal that many carbon trading personnel have little knowledge on the carbon business and negatively impacted business development and its prosperity. It further suggests that carbon trading protect green house gaseous in Tanzania. Also, the study found the availability of weak training on carbon trading business for imparting knowledge of carbon markets in Tanzania. Moreover, the study reveal that Tanzania lack enough carbon projects which limit its development. Also, poor regulations and technologies were a stumbling block in the growth of carbon investment in Tanzania. Likewise, carbon capture and storage are important elements for the effective carbon trading in Tanzania. The study suggests the following measures in order to improve carbon trading in Tanzania. These include creating a flexible and efficient market for carbon reduction and emphasize on the financial institutions to invest in carbon trading. The findings show policy and practical implications on carbon trading. One of the policy implications is that government should prepare policy which will tackle carbon emissions.

The passive seismic interferometry can continuously monitor the injected CO2, allowing us to detect accidental incident associated with CO2 injection (e.g., CO2 leakage from reservoir). Here we used seismic interferometry approaches for construction of virtual seismic data. By applying these methods to the passive seismometer data acquired during fluid-injection experiment in Svalbard in the Norwegian Arctic, we estimated variations of reflection amplitude. The reflectors around the reservoir can be identified on the common mid-point (CMP) gather constructed via seismic interferometry, and they enable us to estimate seismic velocity. Therefore, the technique we have developed in this study can extract subsurface structures around the water-injection field and provide its time-lapse information. On the time-lapse seismic profiles derived from seismic interferometry, the injected water can be imaged as a number of bright reflections within the reservoir. The amplitude anomaly appeared just after fluid injection. The amplitude variation extracted from our analysis has clear relation with pressure. Therefore the variation of reflection amplitude may be induced by pore pressure variation due to fluid injection. This low-cost approach is particularly attractive for long-term, continuous monitoring of CCS projects. We further applied surface-wave analysis for the ambient noise data and estimated variation of S-wave velocity structure in the shallow formation.

While Li-ion batteries have emerged as an ideal technology to reduce emissions through electric vehicles and the storage of renewably-generated energy for electricity, the current cost of Li-ion batteries today limits widespread integration. This cost is fueled mainly by the low earth abundance and high processing cost of Li-ion materials. In this dissertation, I focus on the use of low-cost and earth abundant materials for both Li- and Na- ion battery applications. A platform for the capture and conversion of atmospheric CO2 into solid carbon structures is developed, with an emphasis on the catalytic growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through electrochemical routes. Small diameter CNTs are synthesized through the development of an inert anode capable of activating catalytic particles present at the cathode-electrolyte interface, and careful study of dynamic catalytic processes leads to the first mechanistic understandings of electrochemical CNT growth from CO2. Phenomena such as catalyst size dictating the structure of CNTs synthesized and Ostwald ripening of catalysts over time are studied, and electrochemical \u00e2pinning\u00e2 of catalytic particles through the use of high current pulses is demonstrated to drive the formation of small-diameter CNTs with the first observation of single-walled CNTs from CO2 characterized by Raman spectroscopy. Lastly, these CO2-derived CNTs are integrated into Li-ion batteries at both the anode (as the active material) and the cathode (as the conductive additive with Fe-based active materials) and demonstrate a full-cell with a 68% reduction in CO2 emissions associated with Li-ion materials.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "bba2fdd668f02f4abfa4e474ee8523401c90cf51", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 55378398}, "title": "he evolving perception of risk during reservoir evaluation projects or geological storage of CO 2", "abstract": "If carbon dioxide is to be stored in geological strata other than depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs (e.g. in saline aquifers), relatively little information will typically be available about the potential reservoirs.

The register was used to elicit experts\u2019 perception of risk early in each project and thereafter at regular intervals, finding that the risk was moderate or low for the majority of FEPs. Where FEPs were perceived as high risk, lack of information and uncertainty tended to be the most influential factor.

Using the relatively inexpensive techniques of reprocessing legacy seismic data and conducting a hydrogeological study of the region around the storage site, uncertainty was reduced and the experts\u2019 perception of risk was lowered by the new information. However the risk assessment results also showed changes occurring in the absence of new information and where experts declared no change to their perception of risk.

A promising technology for utilizing it is oxy-fuel combustion with carbon capture and storage, including the potential of enhanced oil recovery for added economic benefits. Although methane oxy-fuel cycles have been studied in the literature, using sour gas as the fuel has not been investigated or considered. In this paper, water is used as the diluent to control the flame temperature in the combustion process, and the associated cycle type is modeled to examine its performance. As the working fluid condenses, sulfuric acid forms which causes corrosion. Therefore, either expensive acid resistant materials should be used, or a redesign of the cycle is required. These different options are explored. A cost analysis of the proposed systems is also conducted to provide preliminary estimates for the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE).

SOC concentrations are controlled by several dynamic variables, ranging from micro-scale properties like particle aggregation, to larger-scale drivers such as climate and land cover. Hence, soils are vulnerable to climate change and human disturbances, with implications for ecosystem services such as agriculture and global warming mitigation. Recent decades have seen greater efforts to monitor SOC dynamics, such as the UKCEH Countryside Survey, and to predict concentrations of SOC where we have no measurements, using geostatistics or machine learning approaches. Yet, there is still much to be understood about what controls spatial patterns of SOC, and how effectively different modelling approaches can capture this. Here, we compare predictions by nine maps of the spatial distribution of topsoil SOC in Great Britain. We found broad similarities in SOC concentrations predicted by all maps, which each showed rightskewed distributions with similar median values (43 to 97 g kg -1 ). The greatest differences between maps occur at higher latitudes and are reflected in the upper ends of the SOC distributions. While the maps generally exhibit a sharp rise in SOC concentrations with increasing latitude from ~54 o N, values predicted by the ISRIC-2017 and FAO-GSOC maps show weaker increases with increasing latitude, and peak at lower values of 332 g kg -1 and 354 g kg -1 , respectively. We demonstrate that most of the maps, regardless of the modelling approach taken or the underlying data used, produced similar estimates of SOC concentration, including broad spatial patterns. This work will form the basis of more detailed future assessments of the sensitivity of SOC mapping to analytical methods versus the data used to drive these methods, and will be used to assess the importance of using stratified random field survey approaches for generating more accurate predictions of areas that cannot be sampled. Exploration of why and where different and coincident SOC predictions occur between maps should shed light on the utility of different modelling techniques and machine-learning meta-analyses of driving variables currently used to map SOC.

Supersaturation ratios and mole consumption rates were evaluated as a function of time for different gas and liquid superficial velocities. Based on available data and the conditions investigated, the kinetic resistance was found to be more influential than the resistance to gas-liquid mass transfer. INTRODUCTION Gas hydrates are non-stoichiometric crystalline compounds that form when a single gas or volatile liquid molecule occupies the cages of structured water (1). Hydrate compounds, containing mostly methane, are made naturally within the permafrost zone and in sub-sea sediment at temperature and pressure conditions within the thermodynamic stability region (1). Methane hydrate is considered a potential energy resource due to its immense quantities and wide geographical distribution. Synthesis of gas hydrates is regarded as a means to capture carbon dioxide from flue gases as well as an alternate method of transportation and storage of natural gas as they eliminate the necessity of very low temperatures (-160 C for Liquefied Natural Gas, LNG) and very high pressures (200 atm for Compressed Natural Gas, CNG). The hydrate contains about 160 Sm per m of hydrate, which is comparable to LNG and CNG, at near ambient temperatures (0 to -10 C) and pressures (10 to 1 atm) (2). The various multiphase systems that have been suggested to produce gas hydrate can be categorized into two groups such that liquid (3) or gas (4) is the dispersed phase. The latter is preferred over the former as gas-liquid mass transfer can be improved by bubbling the gas into the liquid phase. In addition, systems with liquid as the continuous phase benefit from the greater heat capacity of water in order to remove the heat produced from hydrate formation. In this work, a dynamic model that depicts CO2 hydrate formation in an agitated slurry reactor is presented. 1 Hashemi et al.: Dynamic Simulation of Gas Hydrate Formation Published by ECI Digital Archives, 2007 HASHEMI, MACCHI, SERVIO 330 MODEL DEVELOPMENT The hydrate growth system is represented by gas bubbles and growing hydrate particles dispersed in liquid water. Initially gas is dissolved into the liquid in order to create a supersaturated solution. Then, at a specific time called the turbidity point, nucleation occurs generating the seed hydrate particles. Afterwards, by ensuring low supersaturation conditions, gas consumed is assumed to be utilized for growth of already formed hydrates rather than for nucleation. Thus, gas molecules transfer from the bubbles to the gas-liquid interface, then diffuse through the liquid film to the bulk and finally incorporate onto the surface of hydrate particles. Gas and liquid phases are assumed to be at equilibrium at the interface where the concentration is evaluated at the temperature and pressure of the system (5). For sparingly soluble gases, the gas-liquid mass transfer resistance is restricted within the liquid film. Based on the theory of crystallization (6), gas is adsorbed onto the surface of hydrate crystals in two consecutive steps. Gas molecules first diffuse through the liquid film surrounding the crystal towards the surface where they are then adsorbed onto the surface of the crystal due to the lower energy provided at the surface. The enclathration of gas onto the surface is controlled by the equilibrium concentration, which is the solubility of the gas hydrate former in water at the crystal surface temperature (7) and system pressure as it is uniform among all phases (1). Equilibrium concentrations at the gas-liquid and hydrate-liquid interfaces were estimated using the model proposed by Hashemi et al. (8). There is no concentration or temperature gradient across the crystal. Moreover, temperature differences across the liquid films at the gas-liquid and hydrate-liquid interfaces due to respectively the heat of dissolution and hydrate formation were found to be negligible (7).

The GENerate Earth SYstems Science input (GENESYS) spatial hydro-meteorological model outputs from Part I, which represent future hydro-meteorological conditions in the watershed under the ensemble averages of 15 General Circulation Models (GCMs) for two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and three time periods (2011\u20132040, 2041\u20132070, and 2071\u20132100) relative to the 1961\u20131990 base period, are adapted to provide Holos v3.0.3 inputs. Adapting the GENESYS output facilitated Holos v3.0.3 modelling of farm GHG emissions to determine whether the simulated farm with both beef and crop production becomes a carbon sink, or source. The result demonstrated that there may be reductions in emissions related to enteric CH4, manure CH4, manure direct N2O, and indirect N2O for different climate change scenarios and time periods. However, there may also be increases in crop direct N2O and energy use CO2 for the same scenarios. Furthermore, soil carbon storage under fruit tree orchards is expected to increase. According to this result, the simulated farm in the Keremeos Creek watershed is a carbon sink and the carbon capture projects an increase to higher levels, depending on different climate change scenarios and time periods. However, if the simulation is conducted without fruit tree orchards as a carbon sink, the simulated farm in the Keremeos Creek watershed is a carbon source and the carbon emissions will increase for different climate change scenarios and time periods.

These are (i) the potential for increased C~ emissiom from soil under conditions of global wanning, giving rise co a positive feedback on the greenhouse effect (Jenkinson el al., 1991), (ii) increased emission of other radiatively-active trace gases from soil as a consequence of land management practices [(e.g .. greater N10 emission and less CH. consumption with increased N fcrtili~cr use (Bronson and Mosier, 1993; Robenson, 1993)], and (iii) the potential for increasing C storage in soils to explain wh.ac appears co be a contemporary midlatirude C01 sink of 1.3-2.4 Pg yr\u00b7 ' C (rans et al., 1990) and to help ameliorate furure increases of C02 in the atmosphere (Barnwell Ct al., 1992).

Another important ecosystem service of this coastal vegetation is nutrient removal. However, coastal ecosystems are under increasing pressure of global warming and associated establishment of invasive species. To elucidate the respective contributions of seagrass species Posidonia oceanica and Cymodocea nodosa and the non-native macroalga Halimeda incrassata as primary producers and nutrient sinks in coastal habitats we conducted in-situ incubations in the North-western Mediterranean Sea. Measured metabolic activity and nutrient removal as well as calcification rates in these habitats over a 24 h period in spring and summer confirmed that the endemic seagrass P. oceanica represents a valuable ecosystem with high O2 production and considerable carbon capture. The documented regression of P. oceanica meadows with higher temperatures and decline in autotrophy as measured here causes concern for the continuity of ecosystem services rendered by this habitat throughout the Mediterranean Sea with progressing climate warming. In contrast, the enhanced performance of C. nodosa and the calcifying alga H. incrassata with increasing temperatures, under expected rates of future warming is uncertain to mitigate loss of productivity in case of a potential shift in marine vegetation. This could ultimately lead to a decline in ecosystem services, decreased carbon storage and mitigation of climate change.

Although fuel treatments such as thinning and burning are known to immediately reduce forest carbon stocks, there are suggestions that these losses may be paid back over the long-term if treatments sufficiently reduce future wildfire severity, or prevent deforestation. Although fire severity and post-fire tree regeneration have been indicated as important influences on long-term carbon dynamics, it remains unclear how natural variability in these processes might affect the ability of fuel treatments to protect forest carbon resources. We surveyed a wildfire where fuel treatments were put in place before fire and estimated the short-term impact of treatment and wildfire on aboveground carbon stocks at our study site. We then used a common vegetation growth simulator in conjunction with sensitivity analysis techniques to assess how predicted timescales of carbon recovery after fire are sensitive to variation in rates of fire-related tree mortality, and post-fire tree regeneration.ResultsWe found that fuel reduction treatments were successful at ameliorating fire severity at our study site by removing an estimated 36% of aboveground biomass. Treated and untreated stands stored similar amounts of carbon three years after wildfire, but differences in fire severity were such that untreated stands maintained only 7% of aboveground carbon as live trees, versus 51% in treated stands. Over the long-term, our simulations suggest that treated stands in our study area will recover baseline carbon storage 10\u201335\u2009years more quickly than untreated stands. Our sensitivity analysis found that rates of fire-related tree mortality strongly influence estimates of post-fire carbon recovery. Rates of regeneration were less influential on recovery timing, except when fire severity was high.ConclusionsOur ability to predict the response of forest carbon resources to anthropogenic and natural disturbances requires models that incorporate uncertainty in processes important to long-term forest carbon dynamics.

Adding two transport equations to describe the liquid fraction and droplet number, the detailed numerical model can describe the heat and mass transfer characteristics during the CO2 phase change process under the supersonic expansion conditions. A comparative study is performed to evaluate the effect of CO2 condensation using the condensation model and dry gas assumption. The results show that the developed CFD model predicts accurately the distribution of the static temperature contrary to the dry gas assumption. Furthermore, the condensing flow model predicts a CO2 liquid fraction up to 18.6% of the total mass, which leads to the release of the latent heat to the vapour phase.

TotalEnergies, following its ambition to become a responsible energy major, invests 10% of its R&D budget in CCUS to reduce the global process cost and help decarbonize our activities.\n TotalEnergies is both working to decarbonize its own assets and developing a transport and storage infrastructure in Europe, with notably Northern Lights an example of note. It is equally of interest how this transport/storage infrastructure can be of use for other sectors and as such how various full CCUS chains may emerge. This explains the interest to develop techno-economic tools to evaluate CO2 capture processes applied to a wide range of industries. CO2 that is an integral part of the manufacturing process, is particularly difficult to abate in any future scenario, and one particular industry, which is facing such a challenge is the cement sector. CCUS has been identified as a potential solution to help with this issue. The present paper outlines the outcomes of a techno-economic study evaluating CO2 capture technologies based on cement factory retrofitting.\n A literature review aimed at identifying the main characteristics of a typical European cement plant (capacity, process mode, pollutant composition in the flue gas\u2026) was carried out. In this paper, a base case scenario of 90% absorption-based CO2 capture with monoethanolamine (MEA) is compared with four alternative CO2 capture approaches: \u2013An absorption technology based on non-amine solvent.\u2013An adsorption technology based on a Concentration Swing Adsorption process.\u2013An oxyfuel technology derived from the R&D works performed during the CEMCAP project (European CO2 capture project).\u2013A Calcium Looping technology with tail-end process configuration.\n For each of these approaches, the whole carbon capture chain has been considered: this includes flue gas pretreatment, CO2 conditioning (including compression), steam generation, and utilities. Using process simulations, engineering studies have been carried out and have provided Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Capital Costs, Operation Costs and Global Warming Potential (primary energy consumption per ton of CO2 avoided). It enabled mapping the technologies with regards to the cost and volume of CO2 avoided, as well as providing for each of the technologies the break-even point for an eventual CO2 tax.\n Based on these KPIs, several facts have been highlighted: \u2013The need to consider the whole process (including utilities, compression\u2026) and not only the capture unit.\u2013The development of new materials for adsorption and contactor design is already driving down costs.\u2013The availability of waste heat can be a game-changer to implement a CO2 capture technology.\u2013Technology comparisons are location and site-specific and cannot be taken as a basis for concept selection.\n TotalEnergies approach to CCUS is collaborative.

They provide important ecosystem services including carbon sequestration and storage. Drainage disturbs peatland ecosystem services. Mapping drains is difficult and expensive and their spatial extent is, in many cases, unknown. An object based image analysis (OBIA) was performed on a very high resolution satellite image (Geoeye-1) to extract information about drain location and extent on a blanket peatland in Ireland. Two accuracy assessment methods: Error matrix and the completeness, correctness and quality (CCQ) were used to assess the extracted data across the peatland and at several sub sites. The cost of the OBIA method was compared with manual digitisation and field survey. The drain maps were also used to assess the costs relating to blocking drains vs. a business-as-usual scenario and estimating the impact of each on carbon fluxes at the study site.ResultsThe OBIA method performed well at almost all sites. Almost 500\u00a0km of drains were detected within the peatland. In the error matrix method, overall accuracy (OA) of detecting the drains was 94% and the kappa statistic was 0.66. The OA for all sub-areas, except one, was 95\u201397%. The CCQ was 85%, 85% and 71% respectively. The OBIA method was the most cost effective way to map peatland drains and was at least 55% cheaper than either field survey or manual digitisation, respectively. The extracted drain maps were used constrain the study area CO2 flux which was 19% smaller than the prescribed Peatland Code value for drained peatlands.ConclusionsThe OBIA method used in this study showed that it is possible to accurately extract maps of fine scale peatland drains over large areas in a cost effective manner. The development of methods to map the spatial extent of drains is important as they play a critical role in peatland carbon dynamics. The objective of this study was to extract data on the spatial extent of drains on a blanket bog in the west of Ireland. The results show that information on drain extent and location can be extracted from high resolution imagery and mapped with a high degree of accuracy. Under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol Annex 1 parties can account for greenhouse gas emission by sources and removals by sinks resulting from \u201cwetlands drainage and rewetting\u201d. The ability to map the spatial extent, density and location of peatlands drains means that Annex 1 parties can develop strategies for drain blocking to aid reduction of CO2 emissions, DOC runoff and water discoloration. This paper highlights some uncertainty around using one-size-fits-all emission factors for GHG in drained peatlands and re-wetting scenarios. However, the OBIA method is robust and accurate and could be used to assess the extent of drains in peatlands across the globe aiding the refinement of peatland carbon dynamics .", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "64751bfa01d8744fd9b07895639fde4c2d1ba29a", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 222174970}, "title": "Why should Scotland be interested in CO 2 Utilisation ?", "abstract": "Why should Scotland be interested in CO2 Utilisation?

"Deforestation in the northern highlands of Ethiopia has left 35,000 forest fragments ranging in size from 3 to 300 ha (Bongers et al 2006). Deforestation produces edges which increase disturbance within the forest such as decreased water availability and increased light. To determine the degree of these edge effects and the nutrient status of these forests, I analyzed the nutrient composition of soils along a gradient from pasture, exterior forest, interior forest and canopy. I examined two forests at different elevations: Bahir Dar (1800 m) and Debre Tabor (2800 m). Deforestation had a strong, negative effect on soil nutrients. The pasture soils had the lowest % nitrogen, % phosphorus and % carbon in comparison to the other habitats. It also had a significantly lower pH. Isotope signatures and bulk density were also significantly impacted. Pasture soils surprisingly had the lowest C:N ratio due to its minimal carbon stocks. Differences in elevation did not significantly impact the effect of deforestation upon the soil. The differences in pasture soils properties and nutrient composition indicate that deforestation has a significant, negative effect on soil fertility and health. Introduction The dry Afromontane forests of Ethiopia can be categorized as \u201ctropical high montane conifer forests.\u201d Aerially they are seen as dots on the northern highlands with average annual temperatures of 14 to 20 oC and annual rainfalls of 700 to 1100mm (Teketay 2005). These forests, which act as sacred groves for the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahido churches (EOTC) (Wassie 2002), are being rapidly destroyed due to tree harvesting and subsequent conversion to pasture. This deforestation has left 35,000 severely fragmented forests ranging in size from 3 to 300 ha (Bongers et al 2006; Wassie 2002). In 1988, only 2.7% of the original forests remained (Cheng et al 1998). Edge Effects Deforestation generates edges which amplify disturbance within the forest and alter the natural ecosystem. Edge effects can include greater aridity, lower soil moisture levels, dehydration, and damaging winds (Camargo and Kapos (1995), Laurance et al (2000)). Tree mortality can result, allowing solar radiation and winds to penetrate further into the forest, reaching previously unexposed areas (Camargo and Kapos (1995), Laurance et al (1998)). Increased solar radiation and wind can cause \u2018soil drought,\u2019 lowering the amount of available water for vegetation (Camargo and Kapos 1995). Soil nutrient health also drastically changes at the forest border due to such edge effects. Didham (1998) reported an increased litter decomposition rate in exterior forest floor soils. Nitrogen net mineralization rates have increased, leading to more available, mobile nitrogen. However, right after disturbances, plants are unable to take up mineralized nitrogen efficiently and thus there is nitrogen loss due to leaching (Vitousek 1982; Aerts and Chapin 2000). This effect was seen in studies where forest edge soils had significantly lower %N and %C than forest interior soils (Johnson and Wedin 1997; Toledo-Aceves and Garc\u00eda-Oliva 2007). Closeness to edge also resulted in diminished 1 Baimas-George: Soil Nutrient Composition in Afromontane Forests of Northern Ethi Published by Digital Commons @ Colgate, 2012 ! 161! phosphorus levels, indicating that available phosphorus is inversely related to nearness to edge. Phosphorus loss was due to increased occlusion and subsequent erosion (ToledoAceves and Garc\u00eda-Oliva 2007). Thus, I predicted that the forest floor exterior soils would have lower nutrient levels (%N, %P) and a higher C:N ratio than interior forest floor soils Isotope signatures and pH should be similar. Grazing Effects The majority of the deforestation in Ethiopia is due to conversion of forest to pasture land. Tree harvesting and grazing can affect nutrient composition and nutrient processes. Grazing affects the flow of nutrients in ecosystems through stamping, ingestion, urine deposition, redeployment, and export. Tree harvesting leads initially to an increase in the amount of available nutrients which is short-lived due to leaching, erosion, and denitrification (Keenan and Kimmings 1993; Toledo-Aceves and Garc\u00eda-Oliva 2007). Overall, the nitrogen cycling rate ends up decreasing (Reiners et al 1994; Vitousek 1984). Phosphorus pools remain high but biologically available forms are not amply accessible due to occlusion and irreversible exportations (Turri\u00f3n et al (1999), Lavado et al (1995)). The open, exposed pasture will also have a higher rate of decomposition due to higher temperature and wetter climate (Prescott 2002). Due to different environments, soils, and grazing management, the effects of grazing upon soil composition have been found to be contradictory. Neither Lugo and Brown (1993) nor Murty et al (2002) saw significant changes in nutrient soil composition between forest land soils and soils from grazed, unfarmed, pastures. Other studies have seen contrasting effects. Cerri et al (1991) saw a small increase of %C due to low grazing intensity and model farm organization systems. With heavy grazing, soil %C was predicted to decrease as C inputs from above-ground vegetation would decline. A high persistent grazing intensity has also resulted in a steady reduction of %N in soil (Holdo et al 2007). This effect was confirmed consistent with studies of grazed Pampean grassland that found significant decreases in mineral nitrogen and extractable P content (Lavado et al 1995). Toledo-Aceves and Garc\u00eda-Oliva (2007) reported finding similar results: lower concentration of %C and %N and lower microbial C and N in pasture soils versus forest floor soils as well as increases in bulk density and decreases in soil water and porosity (Reiners et al 1994; Milchunas and Lauenroth 1993). Carbon stock changes during conversion of primary forest to pasture have also been investigated as the release of carbon is significant to the global carbon equilibrium and greenhouse gas emissions. Again, results are contradictory depending on soil compaction, clay content, seasonal differences, and pasture supervision. In Brazilian Amazonia, deforestation to pasture has caused a net release of carbon, mostly from biomass (Fearnside 1997b). Twenty-five years after pasture conversion, Veldkamp (1994) found a loss of 2-18% carbon stocks in pasture soils in comparison to primary forest soils of lowland Costa Rica. Similar results were found in Rondonia, with a reduction of 5% in the carbon stock in 3-year-old pasture and a 10% loss in 20-year-old pasture (M. Grzebyk, unpublished data cited by Moraes et al, 1996; p 77). Decreases in carbon stocks were found by Detwiler (1986), Serrao and Falesi (1977) and Houghton et al (1983); these authors found, respectively, an overall decrease of 20% in carbon stock, a decrease of almost 50% in Mato Grosso, and a decline of 25% carbon content with conversion from primary forest to pasture. The decrease in carbon stocks could be due to 2 Colgate Academic Review, Vol. 8, Iss. 1 [2012], Art. 13 http://commons.colgate.edu/car/vol8/iss1/13 ! 162! numerous factors. The loss of cavernous root systems by conversion of forest to pasture could lead to loss of considerable quantities of carbon over short time periods (Nepstad et al (1994)). Minute rises in temperature can considerably amplify the rate of soil respiration, causing a swift drawdown of carbon stocks (Townsend et al 1992). With conversion of forest to pasture, the temperature of the soil rises considerably due to higher solar radiance and thus, it is reasonable to assume a decrease in carbon stocks. Loss of water storage capacity with pasture conversion limits the dispersal of carbon inputs from roots to surface tiers (Cunningham, 1963). Increased decomposition rates will also lead to carbon stock reduction (Post et al 1995). Urine deposition has also had a significant effect on grazing lands as urine spots have increased concentrations of potassium and sodium cations, hydrogen carbonate, and chloride. After deposition, urea hydrolysis and subsequent nitrification begin, escalating the ionic strength of the soil and nitrate to become the dominant ion. Nitrate leaching can then occur at a rapid pace leading to an increase in soil acidity (Haynes and Williams 1992). Lower soil pH can also be a result of an increase of organic matter as organic matter increases cation exchange capacity (CEC) (Haynes and Williams 1993). In regards to these studies, I predicted that pastoral soils would have very low nutrient levels (%N, %P), reduced carbon stocks and a high C:N ratio in comparison to the other soil habitats. It should have a lower pH (Moraes et al 1996), low %\"N and high %\"C signatures. Canopy and Forest Floor Soils In the canopy, nutrients can be hard to acquire due to limited sources and lack of a large soil pool. Thus epiphytes, through their diverse functional morphologies, must be resourceful and competitive to acquire sufficient nutrients (Nadkarni and Matelson 1991). Epiphytes\u2019 main source of nutrients is found in canopy organic matter (COM) (Hietz et al (2002); Stewart et al (1995)) which is made up of live and dead components: epiphyte and host tree litter, \u2018crown humus\u2019 (Jenik 1973), vegetation roots, fungi, invertebrates and microorganisms (Nadkarni et al 2004). The \u2018crown humus\u2019 is best described as an \u2018arboreal histosol\u2019, made primarily of decomposing epiphytic bryophytes (Nadkarni et al 2002). It also contains captured nutrients from atmospheric sources, mist and dust, litterfall, shedded epiphyte tissues, decaying bark, and the debris of canopy animals (Nadkarni and Longino 1990). Thus, canopy soils is organic and contains a relatively large concentration of carbon and nutrients per unit gram soil. It is very microbially active with microbial populations and mineralization rates similar to the upper horizons of forest floor soils (Vance and Nadkarni (1990), Maffia et al (1993)).

Among several greenhouse gases (GHGs), CO2 is the prime contributor and accounts for approximately 60% of the greenhouse effect due to its immense amount of discharges. The iron and steel industry is known as the largest energy consuming manufacturing sector, contributing 5% of the world\u2019s total energy consumption. Also, this industry is emitting about 6% of the total world anthropogenic CO2. Therefore, investigation, development and deployment of alternative energy-efficient iron-making breakthrough technologies along with CO2 capture technologies are receiving high priority to mitigate GHG emissions around 50% by 2050 compared to 2007 level. A new hybrid Multi-criteria Decision Making (MCDM) model was proposed to evaluate the CCS systems in the iron and steel making processes. This model successfully identifies the important optimal criteria and selects the best alternative iromaking technology by considering four prominent aspects (engineering, economic, environmental and social) of sustainability. Surveys questionnaire had been conducted with groups of experts having relevant experience. The model is aimed to transparently and comprehensively measure a wide variety of heterogeneous CCS interdisciplinary criteria to provide insights into aid decision makers in making CCS specific decisions in the iron and steel industry.

An existing carbon capture method is Post Combustion Carbon Capture (PCCC), which is a type of CCS where typically an aqueous solution of amines is used to absorb CO2 from the exhaust gases of an industrial plant. PCCC is currently under research in an EU funded project called ROLINCAP, which investigates new types of absorption technologies, in hope of decreasing the cost of carbon capture. One of these technologies is the so-called phase-change solvents, which can reach a multiple phase equilibrium in the presence of CO2, each phase with different content in terms of amine, CO2 and water. Because of this quality, phase-change solvents require less regeneration energy compared to 30 wt% Monoethanolamine (MEA), which is the conventional solvent for absorption-based PCCC.\nIn this thesis, PCCC using the 35 wt% phase-change solvent N-methylcyclohexylamine (MCA) is compared with using the conventional solvent 30 wt% MEA. The capture processes are theoretically implemented on a 400 MW natural gas combined cycle power plant located in Thessaloniki, Greece. Process integration between the power plant and capture plant was performed to reduce the overall process system energy consumption. The most cost-effective heat exchanger network design among many was chosen for each solvent for further evaluation. Finally, a techno-economic assessment was performed on the proposed capture plant designs, to estimate the capital and operational cost for each solvent process. This was performed with two different cost estimation methods: one factorial method, the other used at the engineering consultant company COWI which is an actor in the ROLINCAP project.\nResults from this thesis show that MCA is the better choice of solvent. It demands about half the heat for solvent regeneration compared to MEA and this difference is reflected in the operational costs. The MCA plant also has smaller flows and equipment, which resulted in lower electricity cost for machinery but also lower capital costs. Altogether, this makes the cost of capturing one tonne of CO2 much lower for MCA than MEA: 18.7 e/tonne CO2 compared to 47.3 e/tonne CO2. Another conclusion is that the potential of heat recovery between the power plant and capture plant is low. The reason is mainly because this is a retrofitting project which limits the integration potential due to constraints.\nThese results should be used with care. The thesis is based on models and information received from other actors. Because of a misunderstanding and modelling irregularity, the capture plant models exclude 19% of the exhaust gas flow and use a different gas composition. Because of this, the capture plant dimensions are not representative for the natural gas power plant in question. However, the composition and flows are still reasonable, and could represent partial capture. Also, the modelled MEA absorption process operates at a higher pressure than MCA. Because of this, the exhaust gas needed to be pressurised which resulted in higher electricity consumption, which increased the operational cost drastically. The higher operating pressure was most likely not required, and the capture cost for the MEA process is therefore higher than it could be.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "1afa4aaf7048c875db100b086c66e0b3f1598c5e", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1115/1.4053980", "CorpusId": 247329946}, "title": "The Impact of Carbon Capture Storage and Utilization on Energy Efficiency, Sustainability and Production of an Offshore Platform: Thermodynamic and Sensitivity Analyses", "abstract": "\n Oil and gas production in FPSOs (floating, production, storage, and offloading) faces a dual challenge: meeting variation in energy demand while decreasing its negative environmental impact. The present paper integrates thermodynamic analysis of oil and gas processing plants and screening analysis to determine the most important operational parameters to lower energy demand and increase efficiency and production. Therefore, the main goals of this work are to identify the contribution of total effect of the operating parameters in an FPSO with CCUS (carbon capture, utilization and storage). Twenty-seven thermodynamic and structural design variables are selected as input parameters for the sensitivity analyses. Four machine learning-based screening analysis algorithms (smooth spline-analysis of variance (SS-ANOVA), PAWN, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and Morris are adapted to achieve the following objectives: 1) overall power consumption of FPSO, 2) CO2 removal efficiency of CCS, 3) power consumption of CCS, and 4) total oil production. The results showed that the optimal operating pressure parameters of CCS significantly reduces the energy consumption and exergy destruction of the key main and utility plants. Further, the total power consumption, CCS efficiency, and CCS power consumption are much more sensitive to CO2 content of fluid reservoir than GOR, whereas the total oil production is influenced only by the GOR content.

Production forests as designated by national forest services cover up to 400 million\u00a0ha, i.e.\u00a0half of the forested area in the humid tropics. Forest management thus plays a major role in the global carbon budget, but with a lack of unified method to estimate carbon fluxes from tropical managed forests. In this study we propose a new time- and spatially-explicit methodology to estimate the above-ground carbon budget of selective logging at regional scale.ResultsThe yearly balance of a logging unit, i.e. the elementary management unit of a forest estate, is modelled by aggregating three sub-models encompassing (i) emissions from extracted wood, (ii) emissions from logging damage and deforested areas and (iii) carbon storage from post-logging recovery. Models are parametrised and uncertainties are propagated through a MCMC algorithm. As a case study, we used 38\u00a0years of National Forest Inventories in French Guiana, northeastern Amazonia, to estimate the above-ground carbon balance (i.e. the net carbon exchange with the atmosphere) of selectively logged forests. Over this period, the net carbon balance of selective logging in the French Guianan Permanent Forest Estate is estimated to be comprised between 0.12 and 1.33\u00a0Tg C, with a median value of 0.64\u00a0Tg C. Uncertainties over the model could be diminished by improving the accuracy of both logging damage and large woody necromass decay submodels.ConclusionsWe propose an innovating carbon accounting framework relying upon basic logging statistics.

The ultimate goal in nanotube synthesis should be to gain control over geometrical aspects of nanotubes, such as location and orientation, and the atomic structure of nanotubes, including helicity and diameter. There is currently no effective and simple purification procedure that fulfills all requirements for processing carbon nanotubes. Purification is still the bottleneck for technical applications, especially where large amounts of material are required. Although the alkalimetal-doped carbon nanotubes showed high H2 weight uptake, further investigations indicated that some of this uptake was due to water rather than hydrogen. This discovery indicates a potential source of error in evaluation of the storage capacity of doped carbon nanotubes. Nevertheless, currently available single-wall nanotubes yield a hydrogen uptake value near 4 wt% under moderate pressure and room temperature. A further 50% increase is needed to meet U.S. Department of Energy targets for commercial exploitation. Meeting this target will require combining experimental and theoretical efforts to achieve a full understanding of the adsorption process, so that the uptake can be rationally optimized to commercially attractive levels.

Therefore, these fields provide an excellent opportunity to evaluate the geologic variability in complex carbonate reservoirs and its impact on CO2 storage configurations. The reefs have historically been studied on an individual scale which does not represent the potential of the entire trend.

Despite the prior art, its value as a way to improve power plant revenues is still unclear. Most studies are based on simplifying assumptions about the capabilities of power plants to operate at part load and to regenerate additional solvent after interim storage of solvent. This work addresses this gap by examining the operational flexibility of supercritical coal power plants with amine based CO2 capture, using a rigorous fully integrated model. The part-load performance with capture and with additional solvent regeneration, of two coal-fired supercritical power plant configurations designed for base load operation with capture, and with the ability to fully bypass capture, is reported. With advanced integration options configuration, including boiler sliding pressure control, uncontrolled steam extraction with a floating crossover pressure, constant stripper pressure operation and compressor inlet guide vanes, a significant reduction of the electricity output penalty at part load is observed. For instance at 50% fuel input and 90% capture, the electricity output penalty reduces from 458 kWh/tCO2 (with conventional integration options) to 345 kWh/tCO2 (with advanced integration options), compared to a reduction from 361 kWh/tCO2 to 342 kWh/tCO2 at 100% fuel input and 90% capture. However, advanced integration options allow for additional solvent regeneration to a lower magnitude than conventional integration options. The latter can maintain CO2 flow export within 10% of maximum flow across 30\u201378% of MCR (maximum continuous rating). For this configuration, one hour of interim solvent storage at 100% MCR is evaluated to be optimally regenerated in 4 h at 55% MCR, and 3 h at 30% MCR, providing rigorously validated useful guidelines for the increasing number of technoeconomic studies on power plant flexibility, and CO2 flow profiles for further studies on integrated CO2 networks.

Documenting year-to-year variations in carbon-sequestration potential in terrestrial ecosystems is crucial for the determination of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. However, the magnitude, pattern and inner biomass partitioning of carbon-sequestration potential, and the effect of the changes in climate and CO2 on inner carbon stocks, remain poorly quantified. Herein, we use a spatially explicit individual based-dynamic global vegetation model to investigate the influences of the changes in climate and CO2 on the enhanced carbon-sequestration potential of vegetation. The modelling included a series of factorial simulations using the CRU dataset from 1916 to 2015. The results show that CO2 predominantly leads to a persistent and widespread increase in above-ground vegetation biomass carbon-stocks (AVBC) and below-ground vegetation biomass carbon-stocks (BVBC). Climate change appears to play a secondary role in carbon-sequestration potential. Importantly, with the mitigation of water stress, the magnitude of the above- and below-ground responses in vegetation carbon-stocks gradually increases, and the ratio between AVBC and BVBC increases to capture CO2 and sunlight. Changes in the pattern of vegetation carbon storage was linked to regional limitations in water, which directly weakens and indirectly regulates the response of potential vegetation carbon-stocks to a changing environment. Our findings differ from previous modelling evaluations of vegetation that ignored inner carbon dynamics and demonstrates that the long-term trend in increased vegetation biomass carbon-stocks is driven by CO2 fertilization and temperature effects that are controlled by water limitations.\n", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "3d87149d8d553cfb1e6bae40ce8ab81baca514c3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1564283189", "CorpusId": 16360303}, "title": "Impact of uncertain CCS deployment on EU climate negotiations", "abstract": "In this paper we propose a stochastic non-cooperative meta-game approach to assess the role of uncertain CCS deployment on climate agreements among 28 European countries.

This work will focus mainly on the injection part and is largely based on simulations of the Sleipner, Snohvit, In Salah and Ketzin injection wells. The aim of this work is to model transient flow in the CO2 injection wells at Sleipner, Snohvit, In Salah and Ketzin with OLGA, in order to identify the current capabilities and limitations. This in turn will form the basis for discussing some of the challenges related to injecting CO2 under various operating and ambient conditions. Large scale implementation of CCS would naturally involve a wide range of operational conditions, both in terms of pressure, temperature, composition, flow regimes and fluid properties, to mention some. The geological spread will naturally also define the boundary conditions at the specific location, and will together with the operational conditions determine how the well behave and respond under various conditions. Varying boundary conditions involve amongst others changes in surface pressure and temperature, temperature and pressure gradients, heat transfer and reservoir conditions, and will depend on factors such as the geographical location, reservoir depth and the properties of the surrounding formations. Four existing injection wells, Sleipner, Snohvit, In Salah and Ketzin, where modeled in order to show how various operating and boundary conditions may change how the wells respond to different scenarios. For all the models, a steady state solution was obtained assuming normal operating conditions. Then, using this as the initial conditions, typical transient scenarios such as blowout and shut-in were simulated for all the wells. This should intentionally illustrate how dynamic simulations can be used to increase the general understanding of the behavior of CO2 under various conditions. All simulations were performed using the dynamic multiphase flow simulator OLGA v7.2 and the single component module. When viewing the results however, it is important to acknowledge the limitations of the module and the assumptions made in the design of the models. Due to license issues, it was not possible to run all the simulations with the CO2 VIP module as initially intended. This would likely have given a more stable results, as the governing equations has been rewritten to better handle pure components and fluids with narrow phase envelopes. The simulations did to a large extent confirm the known limitations of the applied single component module. Accordingly, numerical instabilities were encountered in a varying extent, near the critical point. The reason for the numerical instabilities is that the fluid properties in this region may change drastically for small changes in pressure and temperature. The CO2 VIP module, did on the other hand show promising results, and nearly eliminated the numerical instabilities related to operation in the critical region. Some fluctuations were still present within the two-phase region, but without operational data, it was not possible to validate the model or estimate the accuracy of the results. It was a general trend that all the simulations operating near the critical point did experience numerical instabilities. For the blowout simulations with reservoir backflow, the results were particularly unstable. This seemed to be caused by the elevated pressure which caused the conditions to remain in the critical region for a large part of the simulation. The blowout simulations without reservoir backflow gave better result, but instabilities were still encountered for those simulations entering the critical region. Sleipner was the only well subject to numerical instabilities of significance during the shut-in. This seemed to be caused by the specified boundary conditions, which also here lead the solution to remain in the critical region for a large part of the simulation. Operation below the triple point seemingly gave rise to more unphysical results, and was experienced for both the blowout scenarios, depending on whether the wellhead left the phase envelope before the triple point pressure was reached or not. This was also expected to some degree, as pressures and temperatures below the triple point are outside the validity range of OLGA. The initial and boundary conditions also proved to have a major impact on the results. Although the Snohvit well was specified with a higher backpressure due to the subsea wellhead, the lower initial temperature did seem to give a more isenthalpic depressurization when compared to In Salah for instance. This in turn, seemed to be the reason why the discharge temperature did not decrease as much as the In Salah case, as large parts of the depressurization was done in the liquid region where the isotherms are more vertical. The Ketzin well did not encounter any numerical issues of significance and can largely be explained by the initial state, well within the superheated region. The main difference that distinguishes the behavior of CO2 from common substances such as oil, natural gas and water, is the location of the critical and triple point. As shown by the simulations, the critical region was within the operational range for Sleipner at constant injection and during the shut-in, and all Sleipner, Snohvit and In Salah blowout simulations. The Ketzin well barely touched the saturation line towards the end of the shut-in, but did not enter the two-phase region during the blowout simulations. The low wellhead pressure also led the solution outside the critical region. None of the shut-in simulation did show excessive drop in temperature, and was largely explained by the gradual shut-in procedure obtained from the operational data at Snohvit. The blowout simulations on the other hand, did indicate temperatures well below -20\u00b0C for all the wells except Snohvit. The low temperature is mainly explained by the large drop in pressure and the subsequent evaporation of the liquid content. CO2 also has a high Joule-Thomson coefficient, which causes additional cooling as the fluid expands up the well. It is therefore the rate of change in pressure which gives rise to the low temperature in the wells, as the heat transfer with the surroundings at this rate becomes too low to maintain the temperature. Operational data were also made available by Statoil, and used to match the simulation results from the Snohvit shut-in. The results did close in on the measured data at the wellhead, but the final result seemed to be at the expense of accuracy of the respective parameters. As the iteration cycle is determined to find the solution with the lowest deviation from the measured data, it does not necessarily have to be the most likely combination of parameters. It is therefore very important to be aware of what to expect, and how the parameters are likely to vary. In general, all simulations operating in the critical region did show signs of numerical instability, but the extent varied according to the operating and bounding conditions. Operation below the triple point gave more unphysical results. The CO2 VIP module showed promising results and nearly eliminated the numerical instabilities in the critical region, but needs to be verified. Critically low temperatures were experienced during blowout, but the extent was largely dependent on the operating and bonding conditions. During shut-in on the other hand, all wells remained above 0\u00b0C.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "5defce2f3683b7bbc4e2a6e6d48f4bdb3fd0d67d", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 56413230}, "title": "A VCG AUCTION FOR ELECTRICITY STORAGE CORRUPTION", "abstract": "Energy storage seems set to play a key role in managing and balancing the future electricity system.

It is a very important step to achieve the soil water budget and for deriving drought awareness indices. It is also a basis for calculating soil-atmosphere Carbon flux. Hence, models of evapotranspiration, as part of land surface models, are assumed as key parts of hydrological and atmospheric general circulation models (Johnson et al., 1993). Under particular climate (represented by energy limiting evapotranspiration rate corresponding to potential evapotranspiration) and soil vegetation complex, evapotranspiration is controlled by soil moisture dynamics. Although radiative balance approaches are worth noting for evapotranspiration evaluation, according to Hofius (2008), the soil water balance seems the best method for determining evapotranspiration from land over limited periods of time. This chapter aims to discuss methods of computing and updating evapotranspiration rates using soil water balance representations. At large scale, Budyko (1974) proposed calculating annual evapotranspiration from data of meteorological stations using one single parameter w0 representing a critical soil water storage. Using a statistical description of the sequences of wet and dry days, Eagleson (1978 a) developed an average annual water balance equation in terms of 23 variables including soil, climate and vegetation parameters with the assumption of a homogeneous soilatmosphere column using Richards (1931) equation. On the other hand, the daily bucket with bottom hole model (BBH) proposed by Kobayashi et al. (2001) was introduced based on Manabe model (1969) involving one single layer bucket but including gravity drainage (leakage) as well as capillary rise. Vrugt et al. (2004) concluded that the daily Bucket model and the 3-D model (MODHMS) based on Richards equation have similar results. Also, Kalma & Boulet (1998) compared simulation results of the rainfall runoff hydrological model VIC which assumes a bucket representation including spatial variability of soil parameters to the one dimensional physically based model SiSPAT (Braud et al. , 1995). Using soil moisture profile data for calibration, they conclude that catchment\u2019s scale wetness index for very dry and very wet periods are misrepresented by SiSPAT while captured by VIC. Analyzing VIC parameter identifiability using streamflow data, DeMaria et al. (2007) concluded that soil parameters sensitivity was more strongly dictated by climatic gradients than by changes in soil properties especially for dry environments. Also, studying the measurements of soil moisture of sandy soils under semi-arid conditions, Ceballos et al. (2002) outlined the dependence of soil moisture time series on intra annual rainfall", "year": 2012}]}
