Carbon capture and geological storage (CCS) has only recently been recognized as an efficient means of mitigating climate change. In Europe, with the exception of Norway, the significance of CCS activity only reached that critical level involving the demand for a standardized registry after 2007; furthermore, this task has been confronted by the institutions responsible for resource management. Since 2007, the capture and geological storage activity of carbon from industrial sources has developed dynamically on a worldwide scale. However, over the last 4\u20135 years Europe \u2014 which at one time led research in this field \u2014 has experienced a strong fallback in the spreading of CCS technologies. This is mostly related to economic problems in Europe and low carbon prices. Nevertheless, the rest of the World \u2014 e.g. the United States, Australia and China \u2014 has made notable technological progress with CCS. It is this uneven development of CCS that has led to significantly louder demand for a standardized registry indicating the potential storage on a global scale. The demand has also motivated several organizations operating on an international; level to develop registry systems for potential storage sites. These registry systems are quite similar to those which have been used for hydrocarbons for several decades now; this is due to the fact that most of the applied technology \u2014 as well as the potential storage sites themselves \u2014 are similar. However, there are still some specific characteristics of carbon storage that trammel the general use of some of the definitions applied to hydrocarbons. This paper deals with the presentation of some of the registry systems developed for carbon geological storage over recent decades. The present study focuses mainly on the most complex system proposed by the SPE (Society of Petroleum Engineers). The last part of the paper attempts to classify potential storage sites in Hungary, in line with the SPE system.

Deep saline aquifers are great candidates for sequestration once they offer high storage capacities and worldwide distribution. In the present work, a 2D Cartesian model of a Saline aquifer was developed in the gPROMS ModelBuilder, to provide a practical tool to study the feasibility of an aquifer for the CO2 injection and its dynamic behaviour. The Aquifer model simulates the injection of a specified number of dense-phase CO2 streams into its injection coordinates. The multiphase flow included the application of Darcy\u2019s law extension to each phase (CO2 and water) and implementation of relative permeability correlations. For validation, the results of simulations of the injection into Johansen formation, obtained the simulator Eclipse E100, were accessed. By applying the formation geological data to specify the developed model, results from simulations of two cases of relative permeability, deviate in only 0.18% and 0.24% from the values predicted by Eclipse, establishing the model validity. Furthermore, to test its applicability and sensitivity to the geological parameters, simulations were performed with sets of subsurface conditions of possible sequestration scenarios around the world, yielding quite realistic results.

The aim of this work was to assess the application of nanotechnologies for the restoration of the water quality in the Cascajo Wetlands, Peru, where the water quality was deteriorated. Ceramic-based bio-filters (CBBFs) were used to reduce and buffer the contamination rates of pollutants, whereas micro-nano bubbles (MNBs) were applied to increase the dissolved oxygen and release free radicals in water. Additionally, bio-fence was implemented to prevent water intrusion from the ocean. Remote sensing data through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was used to monitor the water surface condition. With treatment of CBBFs and MNBs for 13 months, we observed reduction in the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphate (TP) in the water body, showing removal percentages of 98.5%, 97.5%, 98.1%, 98.5%, and 94.6%, respectively, in comparison with values before starting the implementation.

However, there is currently no universal standard approach that quantifies GHG emissions reductions for CCS and that is suitable for the quantitative needs of the Cap-and-Trade and LCFS programs. CCS involves emissions related to the capture (e.g., arising from increased energy needed to separate carbon dioxide (CO2) from a flue gas and compress it for transport), transport (e.g., by pipeline), and storage of CO2 (e.g., due to leakage to the atmosphere from geologic CO2 storage sites). In this project, we reviewed and compared monitoring, verification, and accounting (MVA) protocols for CCS from around the world by focusing on protocols specific to the geologic storage part of CCS. In addition to presenting the review of these protocols, we highlight in this report those storage-related MVA protocols that we believe are particularly appropriate for CCS in California. We find that none of the existing protocols is completely appropriate for California, but various elements of all of them could be adopted and/or augmented to develop a rigorous, defensible, and practical surface leakage MVA protocol for California. The key features of a suitable surface leakage MVA plan for California are that it: (1) informs and validates the leakage risk assessment, (2) specifies use of the most effective monitoring strategies while still being flexible enough to accommodate special or site-specific conditions, (3) allow quantification of stored CO2, and (4) offer defensible estimates of uncertainty in monitored properties. California\u2019s surface leakage MVA protocol needs to be applicable to the main CO2 storage opportunities (in California and in other states with entities participating in California\u2019s Cap-and-Trade or LCFS programs), specifically CO2-enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR), CO2 injection into depleted gas reservoirs (with or without CO2-enhanced gas recovery (CO2-EGR)), as well as deep saline storage. Regarding the elements of an effective surface leakage MVA protocol, our recommendations for California are that: (1) both CO2 and methane (CH4) surface leakage should be monitored, especially for enhanced recovery scenarios, (2) emissions from all sources not directly related to injection and geologic storage (e.g., from capture, pipeline transport, etc.) should be monitored and reported under a plan separate from the surface leakage MVA plan that is included as another component of the quantification methodology (QM), (3) the primary objective of the surface leakage MVA plan should be to quantify surface leakage of CO2 and CH4 and its uncertainty, with consideration of best-practices and state-of-the-art approaches to monitoring including attribution assessment, (4) effort should be made to monitor CO2 storage and migration in the subsurface to anticipate future surface leakage monitoring needs, (5) detailed descriptions of specific monitoring technologies and approaches should be provided in the MVA plan, (6) the main purpose of the CO2 injection project (CO2-EOR, CO2-EGR, or pure geologic carbon sequestration (GCS)) needs to be stated up front, (7) approaches to dealing with missing data and quantifying uncertainty need to be described, and (8) post-injection monitoring should go on for a period consistent with or longer than that prescribed by the U.S. EPA.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "191fe8a33efd34646759f01db4ed2e9668179f67", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2529753793", "CorpusId": 132919456}, "title": "CO2 geological storage: The environmental mineralogy perspective Mineralogie environnementale et stockage geologique de CO2", "abstract": "Geological storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the options envisaged for mitigating the environmental consequences of anthropogenic CO2 increases in the atmosphere.

The HyBECCS concept combines biohydrogen production from biomass with the capture and storage of biogenic carbon dioxide.

The lack of upgrade modernisation and environmentally friendly investments in this type of power plant generates the additional costs of the purchase of emission allowances. An analysis of the impact of the addition of a CCS installation to an existing coal power plant on the costs of electricity generation is presented. Based on the accessible technical and economic data, a concept has been framed and an original decision-making model has been developed for an investment consisting in constructing a CCS installation in an existing power plant. A novelty of the paper is the presented proprietary decision-making model in conditions of uncertainty using the real options approach. Stochastic state variables are included in the model: the price of the CO2 emission allowance, the unit costs of capturing, transporting, storing and stockpiling CO2 and the unit costs of electricity generation. It is assumed that the time curves of the state variables are described by equations of geometric Brownian motions. The values of standard deviations in the equations are measures of uncertainty. The value of the retrofit option is defined as the maximum value from the expected net present value. From the dynamic optimisation equation, resulting from Bellman\u2019s principle of optimality, it results that the retrofit option must satisfy the differential equation.

To design efficient CO2 pipeline transportation systems, it is imperative to understand the effect of these impure components on the flow behaviour. The simulation of the effect of CO2 binary mixture on pipeline performance is carried out in this study. The steady-state flow in pipeline is described by a set of parabolic mass, momentum and energy conservation equations. To solve the set of equations subject to the boundary and the inlet conditions of the pipeline, the nonlinear algebraic solver library DNSQE in Fortran is used to study the behaviour of 90 vol % CO2, and 10 vol % single impure component (N2, H2, H2S, O2 and Ar). The pertinent fluid properties are calculated using the Peng-Robinson (PR) equation of state. The presence of impure components changed the properties of the flowing fluid. From the results, H2 shows the most significant impact on the performance of CO2 pipeline as the highest pressure drop has smaller density and greater flow velocity against other CO2 streams. The results also show that Ar had the mildest effect followed by O2, N2 and CO.

Restoring and reforesting such riparian zones to mature forest, particularly along headwater streams (which constitute 90% of stream network length) would both increase carbon storage and improve water quality. Age and management-related cover/condition classes of headwater stream networks can be used to rapidly inventory carbon storage and sequestration potential if carbon storage capacity of conditions classes and their relative distribution on the landscape are known.ResultsBased on the distribution of riparian zone cover/condition classes in sampled headwater reaches, current and potential carbon storage was extrapolated to the remainder of the North Carolina Coastal Plain stream network. Carbon stored in headwater riparian reaches is only about 40% of its potential capacity, based on 242 MgC/ha stored in sampled mature riparian forest (forest > 50 y old). The carbon deficit along 57,700 km headwater Coastal Plain streams is equivalent to about 25TgC in 30-m-wide riparian buffer zones and 50 TgC in 60-m-wide buffer zones.ConclusionsEstimating carbon storage in recognizable age-and cover-related condition classes provides a rapid way to better inventory current carbon storage, estimate storage capacity, and calculate the potential for additional storage.

Electricity generation is based on power units utilizing different combustion technologies. A significant part still comprises old units with capacity 185-195 MWe commissioned in early 70s of last century. These pulverized combustion (PC) based units utilize oil shale as a fuel and are operating with subcritical steam parameters, characterizing by relatively low efficiency 26 - 30% (net, LHV based). Due to their low performance, operational issues (intensive fouling of heating surfaces), and remarkable environmental impact, these units were decommissioned or retrofitted with boilers implementing circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) technology in 2004-2005. Implementation of CFBC technology for oil shale combustion significantly reduced both operational issues and environmental impact. With some additional modifications in turbine island allowing to increase rated capacity up to 215 MWe and after increasing steam parameters, the net efficiency of up to 37% was achieved. Consequently, the specific CO2 emissions in the range of 0.99 \u2013 1.05 t/MWhe depending on quality of oil-shale used, was achieved. Recently, the new 300 MWe CFBC based power unit was commissioned. It is operating with subcritical steam parameters: live steam temperature 565 \u00b0C and pressure 17 MPa. Net efficiency (LHV based) of that unit is 40 % and specific CO2 emissions up to 0.9 t/MWhe in case of firing only oil shale. \n \nIn this study the technical viability of retrofitting oil shale based power generation units with CC is described. In the analysis two CC methods were considered: post-combustion (assuming conventional amine process) and oxy-fuel combustion. Among other CC technologies these processes are at the present time characterized by higher technical readiness level, can be applied for existing units with minimal modifications and are applicable for oil shale fuel with it specifics. \nBesides power generation, Estonia has for almost 100 years of experience in production of shale oil through thermal decomposition of oil shale kerogen in retorts. Currently, solid heat carrier (SHC) method is the main method used for producing shale oil. In this method, direct CO2 emission comes from the preparation of SHC by combustion of solid retorting residue (semi-coke). Mainly two combustion methods are presently applied: lift pipe combustion and CFBC which was recently successfully integrated into shale oil production process.

Bridging the gap between laboratory research and large-scale demonstrations, the NCCC evaluates carbon capture processes from third-party developers, focusing on the early-stage development of the most promising, cost-effective technologies for future commercial deployment. Since its creation in 2009, the center has achieved more than 100,000 hours of technology testing, with research through mid2017 focused on post-combustion carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, gasification, and pre-combustion CO2 capture technologies. After completing more than 25 projects in the gasification and pre-combustion carbon capture areas, the NCCC concluded this work in response to changes in the project scope to focus more on post-combustion capture for natural gas and coal power generation. As the demand for post-combustion CO2 capture options grows, work in this area continues to bring new technologies closer to the marketplace. The post-combustion carbon capture facilities include solvent test units to evaluate developers\u2019 solvents at benchor pilot-scale, as well as sites for developers\u2019 benchor pilot-scale test skids. Testing utilizes flue gas from Alabama Power\u2019s Plant Gaston Unit 5, an 880-megawatt base-loaded, coal-fired boiler. Evaluation of developing technologies using actual flue gas under industrial conditions provides critical information on material and process suitability for scale-up to commercial applications. While several test campaigns have been conducted under simulated natural gas conditions (with air dilution), the NCCC is currently making plans for significant infrastructure additions to support carbon capture testing under actual natural gas-fired conditions. Work is also planned for evaluations of CO2 utilization technologies. More than 30 post-combustion projects have been completed, including three solvent projects that progressed to commercial demonstration. While the advanced solvents and solvent processes offer economic advantages over the standard baseline solvent (monoethanol amine, or MEA), the NCCC also promotes the development of innovative carbon capture processes that could offer more significant cost reductions, such as membranes, enzymes, and sorbents. Several of these processes have progressed with scale-ups to larger-scale testing or commercial demonstration. Because reduction of CO2 emissions is an international issue, the NCCC has been active in establishing test collaborations with international groups, supporting technology developers from seven countries to date. The NCCC also assumed leadership and was the host site of the Carbon Capture International Test Center Network (ITCN) for the past two years. Formed in 2012 in collaboration with DOE\u2019s Office of Fossil Energy, the ITCN facilitates knowledge-sharing among carbon capture test facilities around the world to accelerate the commercial deployment of carbon capture technologies.

India agreed to Kyoto Protocol since 2002 and started its research on GHG mitigation. Few researchers have carried out research work on CO2 sequestration in different rock formations. However, CO2 sequestration in abandoned mines has yet not drawn its attention largely. In the past few years or decades, a significant amount of research and development has been done on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies, since it is a possible solution for assuring less emission of CO2 to the atmosphere from power plants and some other major industrial plants. CCS mainly involves three steps: (a) capture and compression of CO2 from source (power plants and industrial areas), (b) transportation of captured CO2 to the storage mine and (c) injecting CO2 into underground mine. CO2 is stored at an underground mine mainly in three forms: (1) adsorbed in the coals left as pillars of the mine, (2) absorbed in water through a chemical process and (3) filled in void with compressed CO2. Adsorption isotherm is a graph developed between the amounts of adsorbate adsorbed on the surface of adsorbent and the pressure at constant temperature. Various types of adsorption isotherms are available, namely, Freundlich, Langmuir and BET theory. Indian coal is different in origin from most of the international coal deposits and thus demands isotherm experiments of the same to arrive at the right adsorption isotherm. To carry out these experiments, adsorption isotherm set up is fabricated in the laboratory with a capacity to measure the adsorbed volume up to a pressure level of 100\u00a0bar. The coal samples are collected from the pillars and walls of the underground coal seam using a portable drill machine. The adsorption isotherm experiments have been carried out for the samples taken from a mine. From the adsorption isotherm experiments, Langmuir Equation is found to be more acceptable as compared to Freundlich\u2019s and BET adsorption isotherm models. CO2 is soluble in water and is reversibly formed carbonic acid. It is a weak acid since its ionization in water is incomplete. The CO2 solubility in water is estimated from the experimental results published by Wiebe and Gaddy. In most of the cases of abandoned mines, the chances of available air filled void space is limited as the level of operation is below the water table. So it is expected that the void would be completely filled with water. During this research investigation, the practical experimentation for CO2 sequestration was not within the scope. Thus, one operating mine was considered for the feasibility study. The sequestrated quantities of CO2 in terms of adsorbed volume and soluble volume were quantified. The cost of the CO2 was taken from the standard international literature. The sealing cost of the shaft was also considered. Costs of CO2 sequestration for different pressure were estimated for the mine.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "7a138f4efcea71b3badadc9bd42158842b337aac", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2362429188", "CorpusId": 130204622}, "title": "Issues in Development of CO_2 Storage Technology", "abstract": "The CO2 capture and storage(CCS) technology is considered as a significant technology to reduce carbon emission and slow down global climate change.Due to the problems of science and technology,law and regulation,economics,and social acceptance,CCS could not be widely applied.Considering these issues,organizations in United Nations and governments from different countries should set up clear and prospective laws and regulations to stimulate the development and management of CCS.This paper analyzes the current problems of science and technology,law and regulation,economics,and social acceptance,and some other issues which are waiting for more research,experiment and practice.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "48097e5c2ae85cdacd0a8f4bc85e072d4a966233", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2149775926", "DOI": "10.1205/CHERD05049", "CorpusId": 91531720}, "title": "CO2 Capture and Storage: Closing the Knowing\u2013Doing Gap", "abstract": "The capture and storage of CO2 is gaining attention as an option for limiting CO2 emissions from the use of fossil fuels. CO2 capture is premised on the safe long-term storage of CO2 in geological formations. Naturally occurring CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery in the USA, Trinidad, Turkey, Hungary, Brazil and Croatia. Industrially produced CO2 has been used for enhanced oil recovery at the Rangely field in Colorado, USA since 1986 and at the Weyburn field in Saskatchewan, Canada since 2000. Large-scale CO2 storage in geological formations to avoid CO2 emissions was first undertaken offshore in Norway in 1996 and onshore in Algeria in 2004. CO2 delivered for EOR in the USA averaged around USD 11/tonne CO2 during the 1990s.

Adequate knowledge exists in the oil and gas industry for the application of CO2 capture and storage. Widespread implementation of fully-integrated CO2 value chains will nonetheless depend on achieving public acceptance and regulatory approval for CO2 storage, cost reduction for CO2 capture and sufficient economic incentives for the key actors involved.

CCS is a technical process that involves capturing CO2 from large point sources, purifying the emissions to maximize the CO2 content, and transporting the CO2 to a storage site where it is injected, using a specially constructed well, into deep geological formations for permanent storage. Most components of the technology are proven and already in use in the petroleum industry but it is not yet in full-scale use in other industries primarily due to cost and lack of clear regulatory or policy direction from government. Research to improve this technology and lower the costs is underway in several countries. While world governments debate a suitable legal, regulatory, and policy framework it is prudent to conduct geological research to identify suitable sites and geologic formations for storage of CO2.

During combustion, \ncarbon dioxide is formed. The carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere, \nwhich raises the global average temperature on earth through the so called greenhouse \neffect. The only way to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide from combustion \nin a coal fired power plant is through carbon capture and storage (CCS). \nPost-combustion capture is a technology to separate carbon dioxide from the \nue \ngas after the combustion for efficient transport and storage. The steady state operation \nof coal fired power plants with post combustion capture has already been \nthoroughly investigated on a pilot scale, however much work remains to investigate \nthe plants dynamic operation. Due to the increasing amount of intermittent energy \nsources, such as wind and solar power, the energy system will require that the \nplants that run as base load today will be able to rapidly respond to changes in load. \nThe present work investigates the operation of a coal fired power plant with post \ncombustion capture during load changes. The response rate for different design options \nhas been evaluated and discussed with respect to possible operating scenarios. \nThe investigation does not include economic estimations, even though the importance \nof capture cost is discussed. \nAccording to the modelling it takes 90 to 105 seconds to reduce the electrical output \nfrom a power plant with CCS with one percentage point, depending on which \nload the change is made from. A coal fired power plant without the CCS technology \nis approximately eight times faster than a power plant with CCS. To increase the \nresponse rate of a post combustion system, a method for partial capture of the carbon \ndioxide was investigated. This method is referred to as CFCC (Constant Flue \ngas Carbon Capture). This option separates a constant amount of carbon dioxide \nregardless of the power plant load. In this case the system with CCS will change \nthe load as fast as a power plant without CCS because the amount of \nue gas and \nsteam will be kept constant. This option is favorable when the power plant runs on \nlow loads most of the time and increases the load to cover for the peaks in electricity \ndemand. In this case the amount of carbon dioxide captured is less affected by the \nreduced capture capacity. \nAnother option that was investigated was to temporarily stop the capture unit by \nreducing the steam extraction to the separation plant to improve the power plant \nresponse rate, a method referred to as EDCC (Emergency Dumping of Carbon Capture). \nIn that case a lower degree of separation was accepted during the load changes, \nmaking it possible to follow the increased demand on electricity. With this method \nit is possible for a power plant with CCS to make a load change faster than a power \nplant without CCS. To stop the capture unit is the fastest way to make a load \nchange of all investigated options. Reducing the steam drain to the separation plant \nfor the short period of time required for the power plant to increase in load has only \na slight effect on the overall capture rate.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "13f6e85edaf611c009159959707852d1a1e08ca6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1515373817", "CorpusId": 6458551}, "title": "Mapping the social study of carbon capture and storage technology as a climate strategy", "abstract": "It is important to be aware of different approaches to social studies of science and technology.

We applied this concept to a region in the Offshore Northern Gulf of Mexico to understand the opportunities of its oil and gas fields. To estimate the accessible storage capacity we used EASiTool (Enhanced Analytical Simulation Tool) capacity calculator, a closed-form analytical solution in a public Windows application that provides fast, yet reliable estimates in any geologic setting. \n \nResults from EASiTool capacity assessments indicate that the total accessible CO2 storage capacity for pure carbon storage (no production) in oil and gas fields within the area of study is up to ~200 MTonnes. This paper illustrates how an average, representative reservoir in the area of study would have an open boundary storage capacity of 2.3 MTonnes, accessible over a period of 8 years at a rate of 0.28 MTonnes/year through one injection well.

Carbon capture and storage technologies are the leading options, but lately the use of CO2 is also being considered as a very attractive alternative that approaches a circular economy. In this regard, power to gas is a promising option to take advantage of renewable H2 by converting it, together with the captured CO2, into renewable gases, in particular renewable methane. As renewable energy production, or the mismatch between renewable production and consumption, is not constant, it is essential to store renewable H2 or CO2 to properly run a methanation installation and produce renewable gas. This work analyses and optimizes the system layout and storage pressure and presents an annual cost (including CAPEX and OPEX) minimization. Results show the proper compression stages need to achieve the storage pressure that minimizes the system cost. This pressure is just below the supercritical pressure for CO2 and at lower pressures for H2, around 67 bar. This last quantity is in agreement with the usual pressures to store and distribute natural gas. Moreover, the H2 storage costs are higher than that of CO2, even with lower mass quantities; this is due to the lower H2 density compared with CO2.

Additional mathematical modelling work is also presented for simulating steady-state fluid flow and mixing in CO2 pipeline networks containing the various types of impurities representative of the different capture technologies, including pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxyfuel. \n \nThe pipeline rupture transient flow model, based on the numerical solution of the conservation equations using the Method of Characteristics, incorporates Wu\u2019s Modified Peng-Robinson equation of state to deal with pipelines containing pressurised CO2. It utilises the homogeneous equilibrium flow (HEM) assumption, where the constituent phases in a two-phase mixture are assumed to be in thermal and mechanical equilibrium. \n \nThe first part of this study focuses on the development and experimental validation of the CFD model for simulating the dynamic response of inline ESDV\u2019s in limiting outflow following the rupture of pressurised pipelines. The model accounts for the pertinent valve characteristics including the activation and closure times as well as its proximity to the rupture location. The validation of the model involves comparison of its predictions against measurements taken following the controlled Full Bore Rupture (FBR) of a 113 m long, 0.15 m i.d. pipeline containing CO2 at 151 bara and 27 oC incorporating a ball valve along its length. The data recorded and simulated include the transient fluid temperatures and pressures immediately upstream and downstream of the closing valve following FBR. Excellent agreement between the two sets of data is obtained throughout the depressurisation process. \n \nThe above is followed by the linking of the publically available SLAB dispersion model for heavy gas clouds to the validated outflow model. The combined model is then tested against existing experimental data from the CO2Pipetrans research project involving the blowdown of a 30 m long, 0.6 m i.d. of a CO2 pipeline from initial temperatures and pressures ranging 278 to 284 K and 104 to 156 bara respectively. \n \nThe combined outflow and dispersion model is next used to determine the optimal spacing of ESDVs for CO2 pipelines. This is done by solving an optimisation problem involving trading off the 7 % (vol./vol.) CO2 concentration contour area (concentrations above this are considered fatal) against the cost for valve installation. Level diagrams are then used to determine the optimal separation distance for ESDVs. \n \nFinally, the problem of steady-state flow in pipeline networks is analysed. A flow model is developed to determine the required inlet pressure at CO2 source locations to obtain a specific delivery pressure for given source CO2 mixture compositions and flowrates.

An advanced energy system model of the Irish power system is built in SpineOpt, which considers a number of future scenarios and explores different pathways to the wide-scale adoption of Hydrogen as a low-carbon energy carrier. The model contains a high degree of both temporal and operational detail, sector coupling, via Hydrogen, is captured and the optimisation of both investments in and operation of large-scale underground Hydrogen storage is demonstrated. The results highlight the importance of model detail and demonstrate how over-investment in renewables occur when the flexibility needs of the system are not adequately captured. The case study shows that in 2030, investments in Hydrogen technologies are limited to scenarios with high fuel and carbon costs, high levels of Hydrogen demand (in this case driven by heating demand facilitated by large Hydrogen networks) or when a breakthrough in electrolyser capital costs and efficiencies occurs. However high levels of investments in Hydrogen technologies occur by 2040 across all considered scenarios. As with the 2030 results, the highest level of investments occur when demand for Hydrogen is high, albeit at a significantly higher level than 2030 with increases in investments of large-scale electrolysers of 538%.

Here we derive geometric criteria for the capillary snap\u2010off at the pore\u2010throat junctions in 2D microchannels with rectangular cross\u2010sections. The criteria are theoretically presented in three categories according to the range of the throat depth, h. We find that if h is smaller than the throat width, snap\u2010off will be inhibited, if h is larger than the pore width, snap\u2010off may occur but it is independent of h, and if h is in between the throat width and the pore width, a critical depth exists for the occurrence of snap\u2010off.

In these fields, we mainly give full play to steel slag\u2019s mechanical properties.

A great challenge for the stakeholders is that the number of barriers and uncertainties for the full scale deployment of CCS is too high. The aim of this thesis therefore, is to identify the barriers and uncertainties related to the full scale deployment of CCS, present how do different stakeholders assess the barriers and how these barriers and uncertainties identified can be overcome. The methodology chosen for the assessment of the barriers and uncertainties is the Multi-Criteria Assessment (MCA), in which three scenarios are created, a short-term, a medium-term and a long-term, against which the barriers and uncertainties will be assessed. Eight experts from the governmental, scientific, business and environmental sector were interviewed, which although small, still an indicative sample. This thesis results in that the most important barriers and uncertainties for the full scale deployment of CCS are the economic and financial viability, the insufficient CO2 price, the need for stronger incentive mechanisms, the public acceptance, the lack of robust-transparent legal framework and the renewable energy competition. The process of interviewing experts also interestingly revealed that apart from the barriers identified in the literature review from existing social science literature, there are additional barriers to consider and assess for the deployment of CCS in further research. The additional barriers are the political urgency of climate change, the willingness to pay more for our energy supplies, the lack of infrastructure, the efficiency in CO2 capturing process, the unawareness of the climate change by the public, the lack of a global framework and the differences in views between different stakeholders. The assessment process by the experts interviewed reveals that there are significant differences between different stakeholders on how they perceive and score the barriers for the full scale deployment of CCS. The most significant differences are met in carbon lock-in and dependency on fossil fuel.

The loss of wetlands under advancing urbanization not only diminishes this capacity for storage, but increases methane and greenhouse gases as the land is disturbed. Nevertheless, there is growing scientific interest in using artificial or constructed wetlands as a way to mitigate the impact of global climate change, with most attention on their use for water management. Using a potential integrated urban wetland site in Glasgow as a case study, this paper critically examines how artificial urban wetlands can contribute to urban net zero targets in terms of their ability for carbon sequestration, and as part of sustainability initiatives more broadly. We find there are several barriers to implementing artificial urban wetlands for carbon drawdown alone, in particular regarding land ownership constraints, uncertainties in capture efficacy and capture quantitation, and eligibility for market-based crediting schemes. These issues make it currently challenging for the carbon reduction contribution of urban wetlands to be quantified and, say, certified to generate revenue to communities through market-based carbon crediting. However, if integrated within wider community-based sustainability initiatives, artificial urban wetlands can support multiple dimensions of sustainability, creating or supporting value far beyond water management and carbon sequestration objectives. Potential co-benefits range from areas such as health and wellbeing, biodiversity, education, food security, behavioural changes, and social care. Our findings show that for these co-benefits to be identified, maximised and realised, a place-based approach to urban wetland development must be adopted, engaging stakeholders from the project outset to define and facilitate collaboration towards shared outcomes for society, community, and environment.

The production of cement currently accounts for 8% of CO2 emissions worldwide, with a similar figure also true of Sweden. A clear government strategy is therefore needed to work with and provide support to the cement industry for decarbonisation. The most developed pathway for cement decarbonisation in the literature is through the application of CCS. However, the implementation of CCS has been problematic in projects globally. The largest barrier to CCS implementation is the cost. In Sweden, emitting carbon dioxide remains much cheaper under the EU ETS compared to the cost implementing carbon-abatement measures. This thesis aims to explore the pertinent factors surrounding the political economy of CCS implementation, the economic feasibility of CCS implementation in the cement industry and discuss some of the important issues in the CCS debate that are relevant for Sweden. The political economy is valuable here because the interaction between the state and industry can help overcome the economic barriers to CCS implementation. This exploratory study serves as an important case study of the complexity of implementing CCS in an industrial context. CCS, for most, is the only way to decarbonise the cement industry. Further research is needed into how best this transition could be catalysed through regulation and/or fiscal stimulus from the government. The cement value chain is unique in its structure and could lend itself to a lower cost of implementation for CCS than other sectors. Furthermore, when combined with bioenergy, CCS holds the potential for producing negative emissions. This is currently the only well-developed technology to achieve negative emissions. Further research is needed in order to establish the exact potential of CCS with bioenergy to harness negative emissions, a necessity in order to achieve complete carbon neutrality.

The results highlights that reducing water content is a more favourable option compared to reducing SO2 content to minimise corrosion in the system as high corrosion rates can be observed in the absence of SO2 if water content is high enough, but below a minimum water content (~500 ppm), both general and localised corrosion is minimal despite the presence of 100 ppm SO2. \nAnalysis of corrosion products formed on the steel surface is performed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy. Only FeCO3 was detected on the surface without SO2 and O2, whilst both FeCO3 and FeSO3.3H2O were identified on the surface of the carbon steel samples exposed to the environments containing 2 and 100 ppm SO2 and 20 ppm O2. The localised corrosion rates were determined by surface profilometry measurement. \nThe most important observation from this work is that the key degradation mechanism in all experiments was localised corrosion. Not only was the combination of SO2 and O2 shown to influence pitting severity, but the pitting rates recorded were nearly one order of magnitude greater than the uniform corrosion rate determined from mass loss measurements. The increase in SO2 content was shown to influence the shape of pits as well as their overall depth. In particular, the work highlights the importance of adopting a systematic approach when determining pitting behaviour of carbon steels exposed to impure dense-phase CO2.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "f30ea8d1cd974ff7c7b410f1081fba21ad5ede72", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2313704313", "CorpusId": 113045853}, "title": "A risk assessment of CO 2 geological storage for domestic application", "abstract": "In recent years, the importance of Carbon Capture and Storage (hereafter CCS) is growing bigger and bigger.

This research investigates the three major mechanisms of CO2 trapping to determine which method safely captures the most CO2, interrogates the pore pressure effect on storage, and compares traditional core flooding methods for CO2 storage with CO2 drainage which is more practical in the aquifer.\n A core flooding set up was built to replicate reservoir conditions of the Anadarko Basin in Texas, USA. The research involved three reservoir pay zone rocks obtained from depths of about 7687ft that were pieced together to undergo core flooding at 4400psi-5200psi and a temperature of 168\u00b0F. In the first study conducted the core was flooded with supercritical CO2 and brine of salinity 4000ppm to generate relative permeability curves to represent drainage and imbibition. For the duration of the 3rd, 4th, and 5th studies the core saturated with brine is flooded with CO2 at pressures of 4400psi, 4800psi, and 5200psi. Parameters like the volume of CO2 captured, connate water volumes, differential pressure, Ph of produced water, trapping efficiency, relative permeability, and fractional flow curves are noted.\n After scrutinizing the result it is observed that the highest volume of CO2 is captured by solubility trapping followed by structural trapping and residual trapping in that order. From this research, it can be concluded that CO2 trapping, at least for these reservoir rocks, is not affected by pore pressure.

Thus, new power generation processes with drastically reduced CO2 emissions are needed.

In CCS the CO2 is captured and processed on site and thereafter transported to a storage location. Oxy-fuel combustion, which has been studied in this paper, has been demonstrated in large-scale pilot plants (30-60 MW) and is one of the suggested capture technologies. This work investigates the possibilities to co-combust biomass and coal in oxy-fuel combustion for CO2 capture.

However, the high temperature corrosion (HTC) associated with biomass combustion need to be studied in detail in order to determine the potential consequences for corrosion on heat transfer surfaces in oxy-combustion atmospheres. This work is based on experiments performed in a 100 kW combustion unit and modelling of chemical kinetics. The results from this work show that a high CO2 and SOX concentration is clearly beneficial to achieve a high degree of sulphation of the alkali chlorides.

However, the complexity of hydrated cement coupled with extreme subsurface environmental conditions makes it difficult to understand the carbonation reaction mechanisms leading to the loss of well integrity. In this work, we use biased ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to explore the reactivity of supercritical CO2 with the basal and edge surfaces of a model hydrated cement phase\u2014portlandite\u2014in dry scCO2 and water-rich conditions. Our simulations show that in dry scCO2 conditions, the undercoordinated edge surfaces of portlandite experience a fast barrierless reaction with CO2, while the fully hydroxylated basal surfaces suppress the formation of carbonate ions, resulting in a higher reactivity barrier. We deduce that the rate-limiting step in scCO2 conditions is the formation of the surface carbonate barrier which controls the diffusion of CO2 through the layer. The presence of water hinders direct interaction of CO2 with portlandite as H2O molecules form well-structured surface layers. In the water-rich environment, CO2 undergoes a concerted reaction with H2O and surface hydroxyl groups to form bicarbonate complexes.

Chemical Looping Combustion appears to be the more energy efficient than Oxy-fuel CFBC and Ionic Liquids, and less expensive than Calcium Looping and Amine Scrubbing. Calcium Looping (Cal) and Ionic Liquids are also less toxic than Amine Scrubbing. Direct air technology is also very compelling at capturing emissions but highly expensive.

In most traditional applications the goal is to remove impurities from a valuable gas stream, where the impurities are more strongly adsorbed than the valuable components and are typically of little interest. More recently research work has intensified to explore the potential of adsorption based separation processes for the capture of carbon dioxide from process streams or flue gases within the context of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). In these processes the CO2 to be captured is typically the more adsorbed component, so obtaining a high purity product requires the development of appropriate processes. Depending on the CCS scheme, the conditions present may favor the use of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) or temperature swing adsorption (TSA). The high pressure present in a pre-combustion CO2 capture scenario give PSA an advantage in terms of energy consumption, and its fast operation leads to a high productivity. In the case of post-combustion capture, where the flue gas is typically near atmospheric pressure, TSA shows promise, especially if low-grade heat can be used for the regeneration of the bed. The aim of this thesis is to further the understanding of cyclic fixed bed adsorption processes for the capture of CO2 by either PSA or TSA.

The focus of one such effort is on the capture and storage of CO2 (carbon dioxide) from anthropogenic fixed source emissions. This effort can be broken down into a few broad categories such as terrestrial, ocean and geologic sequestration. Geologic sequestration refers to all activities geared towards the capture and storage of CO2 under the surface of the earth in diverse 'reservoirs' such as deep saline formations, depleted oil and gas wells and unmineable coal seams to name a few. This investigation develops a systems perspective for assessing carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) opportunities within the realm of geologic sequestration. While multiple concurrent research activities continue to explore CCS opportunities from various perspectives, efforts at a systems analysis of the overall picture are just beginning. A systems view describing methodologies to integrate a variety of CCS data to assess potential sequestration opportunities is at the heart of this study. It is based on research being conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under sponsorship of the United States Department of Energy (DOE). Using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and publicly available data, a detailed characterization of CO2 sources and reservoirs are being developed. A source-reservoir matching process will be implemented which begins with quantifying the 'capturability' of a CO2 source, a function of the purity, volume and several site specific considerations. Next, the potential proximate reservoirs are identified and then ranked based on transport options, type, capacity, cost, regulatory considerations", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "a1535c46a204e91ac3de1e83d922091203ca1fbb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2906811942", "DOI": "10.5281/ZENODO.1459642", "CorpusId": 134987816}, "title": "CO2-EOR possibilities in Romania : A First Screening for the Implementation of CO2-EOR Technology in Romania", "abstract": "Romania is committed to reduce CO2 emissions and efforts are made to speed up the implementation of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage\u00a0(CCUS) technology in our country.

Depending on GxE as well, Carbon (C) is differentially allocated to stem internode structural (lignocellulosic) and non-structural (sugar) components, making stem biomass appropriate to diverse end-uses (feed, energy, bioproducts...). Then optimizing C resource acquisition and allocation to stem component sinks is a major challenge for sorghum breeding toward the conception of plant ideotypes. By accounting for traits involved in C source-sink relations in a dynamic way and at the organ level, FSPM can be of major interest to support the analysis of biomass sorghum phenotypes. EcoMeristem model is designed for this purpose. It simulates plant and crop performance (biomass, sugar, grain) as the result of GxE acting on C sink activity (organ size and number, dynamically set-up in plant topology) and their regulation by their competition for a common pool of C resource within the plant, computed in a simple way at crop level (Beer-Lambert for light interception, Monteith for its conversion into C). This model, initially developed for rice, was recently tested for its ability to capture the phenotypic variability met across eight contrasted genotypes of biomass sorghum. Whereas tiller number, stem and leaf biomass at whole plant level were correctly modelled, biomass partitioning between the main stem and tiller(s) was unreliable: nonstructural (C stored) and a minor extent structural biomass of the main stem was reduced to the benefit of tiller stem growth, suggesting some limits in the way C source acquisition and/or C sink rules of dominance among culms. The aim of the present study was to evaluate concepts for representing C source-sink relationships in EcoMeristem and better capturing the phenotypic variability of biomass sorghum. For this purpose, the current concepts used in this model were compared to more detailed approaches enabling to differentiate the culms with respect to C source and/or sink activity. Regarding C source acquisition, a light interception model taking into account canopy closure dynamics (from isolated plant to row and closed canopy) and horizontal canopy layers defined by leaf age, temperature and sunlit/shaded ratio, was implemented. It was combined with a photosynthesis model inspired from Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry's model to compute C assimilation at leaf level. These modules together enable to compute C supply either at whole plant or culm level. Regarding C sink activity, an exploratory formalism was implemented that prioritized C sinks (i.e. growing organs and C storage in internodes) for their access to C resource, according to the age of the culm they belong to (proxy of apical dominance). These different C source and sink related concepts are currently compared to a dedicated field data set. This data set deals with two genotypes and tiller pruning treatments to evaluate the competition between main stem and tiller growth. Accordingly, these source-sink concepts are being benchmarked regarding their ecophysiological relevance and computation time efficiency. Results will be presented and discussed with respect to the added value of each approach for analyzing biomass-sorghum phenotypes.", "year": 2016}]}
