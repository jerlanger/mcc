However, solid residues generated during the combustion of biomass pose a separate set of environmental and economic challenges that must be addressed. In order to utilise the full potential of this waste stream, an effective nanoporous carbonaceous adsorbent for CO2 capture has been directly prepared via a simple and low-cost extraction technique from industrial-grade biomass combustion bottom ash generated at a UK power plant. The adsorbent characterisation data (via Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectroscopy as well as Fourier- Transform Infrared Spectroscopy) agrees well with the CO2 adsorption curves obtained through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA results have revealed a CO2 adsorption capacity of 0.73 mmol/g at 25\u00b0C and 1 atm under a pure CO2 gas stream, thus, proposing a promising and viable route towards in-situ decarbonisation of the biomass combustion sector in the UK via effective waste valorisation.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "e7e1afd470171646dcfd1e74ec8d4c39c9001daa", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.2118/205706-ms", "CorpusId": 242539774}, "title": "Reservoir Characterization for Uncertainty Analysis and Its Impact on CO2 Injection and Sequestration in a Depleted Offshore Carbonate Gas Field", "abstract": "\n The emerging global climate change policies have necessitated the strategic need for prudent management of produced contaminants and, with cold flaring being no more the best option, Carbon Capture Utilization & Storage (CCUS) technology provides opportunity for development of high CO2 contaminant fields. A typical CO2 sequestration project comprises capturing CO2 by separating from produced hydrocarbons followed by injection of CO2 into deep geological formations for long term storage. While injection ofCO2 may continue over tens of years, the long-term containment needs to be ascertained for thousands of years. Several geological and geophysical factors along with the existingwells need to be evaluated to assess the potential risks for CO2 leakage that maychallenge the long-term containment.\n This study considers a depleted carbonate field located offshore Sarawak as a possible long-term CO2 storage site. Elements that may lead to possible leakage of CO2over time are the existing faults or fractures, development of new fractures/faults during injection, caprock failure due to pressures exceeding fracture pressure during/after injection and possible leakage through existing wells. The risk assessment process includes identification and mapping of faults and fracture networks, mapping of seals, evaluation of seismic anomalies and gas while drilling records, pore-pressure analysis, laboratory experiments for analyzing changes in geomechanical & geochemical rock properties and well integrity of existing wells. All these parameters are cross correlated, and qualitative risk categorization is carried out to determine the robustness of the reservoir for long term CO2 storage.\n The evaluation of available data indicates less frequent faulting occur only towards the flank with no seismic anomalies associated with them. Some seismic anomalies are observed at shallower levels, however their impact on the reservoir and overburden integrity is assessed to be minimum. There are four shale dominated formations mapped in the overburden section, which will act as potential seals. Estimated fracture pressures for the potential seals ranges between 6200-9280 psia for the deepest seal to 2910-4290 psia for the shallowest. Therefore,it is interpreted that if the post injection reservoir pressure is kept below the initial reservoir pressure of 4480 psia, it would not hold any threat to the caprock integrity.Leakage rate riskalong the existing wells was determined based on well log data. Well integrity check of legacywells helped identify two abandoned wells for rigorous remediation to restore their integrity.\n The subsurface risk analysis is critical to ascertain the long-term containment of injectedCO2. The integrated subsurface characterization and well integrity analysis approach adopted in this work can be applied to any other field/reservoir to validate its robustness for long-term CO2 injection and storage.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "95623c7060be1ef4f6b0ca85e0440b6914b8ff91", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2154754929", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1365-313X.2009.03967.x", "CorpusId": 25072692, "PubMed": "19594710"}, "title": "An AP2-type transcription factor, WRINKLED1, of Arabidopsis thaliana binds to the AW-box sequence conserved among proximal upstream regions of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis.", "abstract": "Although an APETALA2 (AP2)-type transcription factor, WRINKLED1 (WRI1), has been shown to be required for accumulation of triacylglycerols (TAGs) in Arabidopsis seeds, its direct target genes have not been established.

While in spring, the plants were well watered, the summer regrowth was exposed to drought and elevated temperature (+3\u00a0\u00b0C) by infrared heating of the canopy during 3\u00a0weeks. We assessed the elemental and isotopic composition, lignin and non-cellulosic carbohydrate content and composition of plant material grown under all three conditions. Its mineralization potential in soil and priming effects were evaluated during laboratory incubation.ResultsWarming had no significant effect on elemental and stable isotope composition of both plant materials. In contrast, it resulted in reduction of lignin content for both plant species and decrease of the lignin-to-N ratio for F. arundinacea and increased non-cellulosic carbohydrate content for D. glomerata. Summer regrowth was characterised by increase of \u03b413C values, which is consistent with variations in stomatal conductance due to water shortage. Moreover, summer drought induced an increase in N content leading to decrease of the C/N ratio and increase of lignin-to-N ratio of summer regrowth compared to spring regrowth. Differences in decomposition were small, while priming effects were more strongly altered by the different exposure to enviromental.ConclusionOur results provide direct experimental evidence that extreme climatic events (high temperature and precipitation deficit) have an influence on soil carbon storage particularly through their effect on priming of native soil organic matter induced by altered plant litter.

To assess the geomechanical stability of faults, it is of crucial importance toknow the in situ stateof stress. In situ stress measurements can provide some information on the stresses acting on faults but with considerable uncertainties. In this paper,we investigate howsuch uncertainties, as defined by the variation of stress measurements obtained within the study area, could influence the assessment of the geomechanical stability of faults and the characteristics of potential injection-induced seismic events. Our modeling study is based on a hypothetical industrial-scale carbon sequestration project assumed to be located in the Southern San Joaquin Basin in California, USA. We assess the stability on the major (25 km long) fault that bounds the sequestration site and is subjected to significant reservoir pressure changes as a result of 50 years of CO2 injection. We present a series of geomechanical simulations inwhich the resolved stresses on the fault were varied over ranges of values corresponding to various stress measurements performed around the study area. The simulation results are analyzed by a statistical approach. Our main results are that the variations in resolved stresses as defined by the range of stress measurements had a negligible effect on the prediction of the seismic risk (maximummagnitude), but an important effect on the timing, the seismicity rate (number of seismic events) and the location of seismic activity. 2016 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of BS\u2013CF combinations on peanut yield, soil properties, and carbon (C) storage in a red soil (Ultisol) in southern China.Materials and methodsThe soil was fertilized with five treatments, including a control (T1), CF-only (T2) treatment, and three treatments with different BS\u2013CF combinations (T3\u2013T5). The final quantities of N/P2O5/K2O applied in T2\u2013T5 were 120:90:135\u00a0kg\u00a0ha\u22121.

Achieving high injection rates in deep saline aquifers requires a detailed assessment of injectivity performance and evaluation of the processes that alter the permeability of the near-well region. One of the most common forms of the injectivity loss in the context of CO2 storage in saline aquifers is salt precipitation driven by the evaporation of brine into the relatively dry injected CO2 stream. We present a novel compositional transport formulation based on overallcomposition variables which models salt as a separate solid phase which could potentially form through two essentially different ways, i.e., kinetic or equilibrium. To model formation drying-out and subsequent haliteprecipitation, an accurate and reliable fluid model ePC-SAFT, which can effectively account for ionic effects, is applied. In addition, a volume balance approach (i.e., depending on how far the salt saturation is from the solubility limit) is implemented to estimate solid saturation in a simulation cell.

The recommended master plan includes an integrated system of energy efficiency retrofits, a direct current solar/storage/electric vehicle microgrid, alternating/direct current houses, and water efficiency retrofits with rainwater capture. The recommended master plan is projected to be close to zero-net energy (95 percent) for homes, reduce carbon emissions by 65 percent at the block scale (including transportation), and reduce water use 60\u201370 percent. The integrated system of energy efficiency and a direct current solar/storage/electric vehicle (EV) charging microgrid is the first of its kind at the residential block scale. This breakthrough because the deep energy efficiency retrofit savings free up enough capacity in the solar supply and storage to enable residents to switch from natural gas to electricity for heating and domestic hot water and to provide EV charging for 33 percent of vehicle miles traveled. The savings in household transportation costs are a game changer because when combined with savings in the electric and water utility bills, the total cash flow savings are projected to fund the capital improvements of the proposed systems. This project\u2019s benefits include lower and more predictable utility bills; greater resiliency because the system can operate during outages, and vastly improved indoor air quality by reducing natural gas consumption. The local energy storage reduces peak demand for the utility. California benefits from a model that exceeds the targets for reductions in energy consumption and carbon emissions and the reductions in water use address California\u2019s severe water challenges.

Amine-based CO2 absorption technology is proposed in this study to be retrofitted into the power plant due to its high selectivity and high absorption capacity. However, the associated energy penalty to such technology is relatively high and energy intensive and exhibits process dynamic which necessitates more research to ensure a significant reduction in carbon capture costs achievable. The present work tackles these limitations by analysing the steady-state simulation via Aspen Plus (version 8.8) in determining the technical and economic parameters that make CO2 capture system more efficient, economic and less energy intensive. Optimization of the process was aimed towards minimal reboiler heat duty and maximum CO2 removal efficiency in having the least economic impact of the process. The optimal operating conditions resulted from this study were found to be at 30\u00a0\u00b0C (1\u00a0atm.) for the absorber and at 120\u00a0\u00b0C (2\u00a0atm.) for stripper.

The results showed that the soil C content during the late\u2010successional period was greater than that during the early\u2010successional period, that is, annual C storage rates for the first sequence (1\u201315\u2009years) for the 0\u201360\u2009cm depth profiles were \u22120.34, \u22120.27, \u22120.15 to 0.02\u2009Mg\u2010C ha\u22121 yr\u22121, in the \u226410, 11\u201320, 21\u201330, and >30 community densities.

Unconventional and conventional reservoirs provide opportunities for beneficial use such as enhanced recovery, supercritical CO2 (ScCO2) fracturing, and storage of gases such as CO2 and ancillary gases, or potentially hydrogen. The purpose of this study is to use Australian unconventional rock packages to understand the controls on CO2 reactivity and mineral trapping (the most secure form of storage) and compare the potential for CO2 storage. Characterization of core from the Surat, Eromanga, and Cooper basins, Australia, is used to populate CO2 and production water-rock reactivity models. Sensitivity to production water composition and temperature was also tested. Coal seam gas (CSG) reservoir interburden ranged from clay-rich mudstones to interlaminated sandstone and mudstone, and calcite cemented sandstones. The coal seam interburden samples contained high plagioclase and chlorite content. They were predicted to alter to carbonates calcite, ankerite, siderite, and dawsonite mineral trapping CO2. After 30 years, net mineral trapping varied from \u22120.1 to +0.3 kg CO2/m3, and pH was 4.6\u20134.9. Net mineral trapping after 1,000 years varied from 5.7 to 16.3 kg CO2/m3 and was 17.1 kg CO2/m3 with higher salinity water. The mineral content had the main control with different lithologies decreasing mineral trapping by 41 or 35% compared with a base case. Overlying plagioclase-rich sandstone trapped 17.1 kg CO2/m3 as calcite, ankerite, dawsonite, and siderite after 1,000 years with the pH increasing to 6. For the quartz-rich oil reservoir sandstone, however, only 0.3 kg CO2/m3 was trapped after 1,000 years. Gas shale and marine black oil shales contained high mica, chlorite, and feldspar content that could be converted to carbonate minerals, mineral trapping CO2. A marine black oil shale mineral trapped 8.3 and 13.9 kg CO2/m3 after 30 and 1,000 years, respectively, as siderite and ankerite.

Carbon capture storage (CCS) technology which involves carbonation of carbon dioxide into calcium carbonate with the aid of calcium oxide adsorbent is widely applied.

During this project, calcium oxide and calcium oxide-nickel oxide adsorbents were successfully synthesised through sol-gel method. The data needed for this analysis was obtained from carbonation of adsorbents at temperatures of 400, 500 and 600 oC with the aid of Thermogravimetric Analyser (TGA). The results showed that high adsorption rate and adsorption capacity could be achieved at the initial stage, chemical reactioncontrolled stage, at higher carbonation temperature as well as by addition of NiO catalyst.

The vertical mixing ratio profile measurements along the 115 m tall tower has been completed with occasional aircraft measurements up to 3000 m above the ground. The poster presents the Hungarian tall tower site and the temporal variation of carbon dioxide observed here. We discuss the region of influence determining the mixing ratio variability, the so-called concentration footprint, as well as that of the flux measurements. Methodological problems caused by the elevated monitoring levels, and their solutions, are also given. The environmental factors governing the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of the vegetation are analyzed by means of a process oriented ecosystem simulation model. It might be used to estimate the future behavior of the region as the climate is changing. On the basis of the measurements at Hegyh\u00e1ts\u00e1l a boundary layer model has been developed which can give rough surface-atmosphere carbon dioxide flux estimate for sites where only surface mixing ratio monitoring is available. TEMPORAL VARIATION OF CARBON DIOXIDE MIXING RATIO At Hegyh\u00e1ts\u00e1l, West Hungary (4657'N, 1639'E, 248 m also a NOAA flask sampling site [HUN]), the atmospheric mixing ratio of carbon dioxide has been being monitored in a plain, rural, mid-continental environment at four elevation levels (10 m, 48 m, 82 m, 115 m) on a TV/radio-transmitter tower since 1994. An early study (Haszpra, 1999) showed that the spatial representativeness of the night-time measurements are rather limited, however, the daytime footprint analysis based on the method of Gloor et al. (2001) indicates that the daytime values may be characteristic up to a region of 100 thousand km. Due to the geographical position of the station the CO2 mixing ratio shows remarkable diurnal and seasonal variations. The maximum daytime average concentrations are measured in December-January, well before the net uptake period of the biosphere, similarly to a few other Central European stations. The phenomenon emphasizes the importance of the advection in the formation of the regional CO2 concentration field. It is also supported by the temporal variation in the vertical profile of the CO2 mixing ratio. The extended spatial representativeness of the daytime data allows the combination of the data series from Hegyh\u00e1ts\u00e1l and another Hungarian CO2 monitoring station (K-puszta, 4658'N, 1933'E, 125 m) operated between 1981 and 1999. The 24-years long combined data series shows a 1.7 ppm/year linear increase from 343 ppm in mid-1981 to 384 ppm in mid-2005. The CO2 mixing ratio in the middle of this highly industrialized, densely populated continent is about 3.7 ppm higher on average than the corresponding marine boundary layer reference (GLOBALVIEW-CO2, 2004). The time series follows the interannual variation in the global background fairly well, however, the amplitudes of the fluctuations are higher indicating the importance of the biosphere in the process. NET ECOSYSTEM EXCHANGE Hegyh\u00e1ts\u00e1l is also the site of regional scale biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchange monitoring. The poster gives the results of the multiannual CO2 NEE measurements performed at the tall tower site. The eddy covariance measuring system is operated at 82 m elevation on the tower, above an area covered by agricultural fields and forest patches. NEE of CO2 is determined as the sum of the eddy flux at 82 m and the rate of change of CO2 storage below the measurement level. During the dormant season typical net exchange is around 1 g C m day, while the vegetation adsorbs around 2 to 4 g C m day in the growing season. During the period of 1997-2004 (year 2000 is missing) the region mostly behaved as a weak net CO2 sink on annual scale. Year-round NEE was in the range of -107\u00b148 g C m year and 69\u00b137 g C m year (Table 1). Climate data are presented on the poster to explain the interannual variability of NEE, gross primary production (GPP) and total ecosystem respiration (Reco). The region of representativeness of the direct flux measurements are estimated for daytime unstable conditions using the surface layer footprint model of Schmid (1994). The peak location of the footprint function is also estimated using the simple parameterized mixed layer footprint model of Kljun et al. (2004). The two different footprint estimates are compared well which means that the source area of the measured NEE signal is well established though the vegetation around the tower is rather heterogeneous Table 1.

The model was adopted to reconstruct the present state of carbon balance of the vegetation, and to give an estimate of the future changes in the carbon budget. As a first step the carbon budget of the semi-natural grassland located at the tall tower site was simulated. The results of the eddy-covariance measurement, specially designed for the grassland and covering 1999-2000, were used for the model validation. The first results are promising since the BIOME-BGC model was able to capture the order of magnitude of the measured NEE, GPP and Reco without any special refinement. The poster presents the most recent results together with the reference NEE data. BOUNDARY LAYER BUDGET MODEL The parallel measurements of NEE and CO2 mixing ratio has the unique opportunity to challenge the boundary layer budgeting in the region. It is assumed that during well mixed conditions the CO2 mixing ratio measured at the highest monitoring level on the tower (115 m) is a good estimate of the average CO2 concentration of the convective boundary layer (CBL). Daytime regional scale surface flux can be calculated using the mass conservation equation for the CBL (Denmead et al., 1992) from the measured changes in the CO2 mixing ratio and CBL height. The CBL model results available in the literature cover only a few days. We have made attempts to extend the temporal applicability of the CBL model in order to investigate the dependence of the model error on the input data. The CBL model was tested for 2003. We present the dependency of the model results on the different input parameters. REFERENCES Denmead, O. T., M. R. Raupach, F. X. Dunin, H. A. Cleugh, and R.

Sustaining Ohio\u2019s current coal-based power production while transitioning to a low-emissions economy will require the state to develop and introduce strategies for carbon capture and geologic storage, possibly in conjunction with CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR). Collectively these are referred to as carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). Ohio\u2019s oil and gas reservoirs may store between 205 and 878 million metric tonnes CO2 [Battelle, 2016], which is 2.6 to 5.2 times the 79 million tonnes of CO2 emitted from Ohio\u2019s power sector in 2016 [U.S. EPA, 2017]. To date, no large-scale CCUS operations have been conducted in Ohio. This allows time to develop a focused strategy to implement CCUS by building on similar projects outside the state while tailoring to local geography, geology, and risks. As part of the strategy, a field-specific risk framework for CCUS in depleted oilfields has been created. This presentation will describe the method used to conduct risk assessments and the results of risk assessments for potential CCUS projects at three legacy oilfields in Ohio. The fields are the East Canton Consolidated Oilfield, Morrow Consolidated Oilfield, and Gore Consolidated Oilfield with 3,483, 898, and 5992 wells, respectively. Field-scale well integrity studies have had to rely largely on historical data to assess the potential for fluid leakage related to CCUS projects. Several groups have developed methods to identify risky wells that may need to be monitored or remediated. These methods serve as analogs for determining the frequency of wellbore leakage in other fields. Methods to assess well integrity can be qualitative, semi-quantitative, or quantitative. This study defined risk as the product of the likelihood of occurrence and the severity of occurrence of leakage (Equation 1).

However, the scientific community has identified the means to alleviate the environmental burden through carbon capture and storage, and utilisation of CO2 for synthesis of value added chemicals. The latter greener approach for utilising CO2 as a C1 feedstock for organic chemical synthesis is extremely beneficial not only for the chemical industry but also for contributing to limit its emissions. The direct synthesis of butylene carbonate (BC) through cycloaddition reaction of CO2 to butylene oxide (BO) is of a great commercial interest. BC is an excellent reactive intermediate material used in industry for the production of surfactant, plasticisers, polymers and can also be used as a solvent for wood binder resins, degreasing, paint remover, lubricants and the foundry, sand binders as well as lithium battery because of its high polarity property. Several reaction routes have been attempted for BC production, e.g. phosgene, oxidative carboxylation, direct synthesis using homogeneous catalyst and direct synthesis using a heterogeneous catalyst. The latter being the most attractive route due to the inexpensive raw material, ease of catalyst recovery and avoidance of corrosive reagents, such as phosgene. In the present work, a facile and environmentally benign method has been developed for the synthesis of highly efficient graphene-inorganic heterogeneous catalyst, represented as Cu\u2013Zr/GO inorganic composite. The graphene-inorganic heterogeneous catalyst has been characterised using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and nitrogen adsorption/desorption method (for measuring BET surface area and pore size distribution). Copper-zirconia/graphene inorganic composite catalyst (Cu\u2013Zr\u2013GO) as heat treated at 723 K exhibited high catalytic activity as compared to other reported heterogeneous catalysts in the absence of any organic solvent with 71% yield of BC, and 87% selectivity towards BO at the reaction conditions of 423 K, 80 bar in 12 h. The use of Box-Behnken Design (BBD) from Response Surface Methodology (RSM) has been employed to investigate the single and interactive effect of several independent reaction variables that include temperature, pressure, catalyst loading, heat treatment and time, on the conversion of BO and yield of BC. Two quadratic regression models have been developed representing an empirical relationship between each reaction response and all the independent variables. The predicted models have been validated statistically and experimentally, where very high agreement has been observed between predicted and experimental results with approximate relative errors of \u00b11.25% for BO conversion and \u00b1 0.75% for BC yield.

A single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) is a graphene sheet rolled-over into a cylinder with typical diameter on the order of 1.4 nm similar to that of a C60 buckyball. A multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) consists of concentric cylinders with an interlayer spacing of 3.4 A and a diameter typically on the order of 10\u201320 nm. The lengths of the two types of tubes can be up to hundreds of microns or even centimeters. A SWNT is a molecular scale wire that has two key structural parameters. By folding a graphene sheet into cylinder so that the beginning and end of a (m; n) lattice vector in the graphene plane join together, one obtains an (m; n) nanotube.

The CCS process appears to be imminent in AustraliaI, as evidenced by current initiatives such as Carbonet, and supercritical CO2 pipelines represent the anticipated mode of CO2 transport from the capture to storage sitesII. A thorough literature review was conducted, which includes studies of the corrosion mechanism related to supercritical CO2 during transport, and the recent contributions from a dynamic field that is continuing to evolve throughout the course of this project. An empirical approach was used in this project to determine the effect of various input variables, including salt and acid impurities, temperature and pressure, on the subsequent corrosion rates of steel in the likely CCS relevant stream chemistry. A high throughput methodology was developed to screen a range of electrolyte chemistries in atmospheric (aqueous) conditions, and supplemented by tests in supercritical CO2. For this, a high pressure autoclave was also used to simulate the high pressure (>7.5MPa) during supercritical CO2 transport. This enabled an empirical model to be developed, in order to predict the expected corrosion rate as a function of electrolyte chemistry \u2013 serving as a platform for benchmarking CCS pipeline durability. The techniques in this study include potentiodynamic polarisation tests, weight loss tests, scanning electron microscopy, and optical profilometry. Generally, corrosion rates obtained from the presence of acid impurities and in the presence of an aqueous phase, were high. Corrosion attack was typically localised, with potential for severe attack in cases where co-speciation of acids with carbonic acid could occur. Experiments with increasing water concentration and pressure showed increased corrosion rates attributed to the increased solubility of CO2 in water and the behaviour of the corrosion product (iron carbonate). A correlation was also observed between experiments conducted in aqueous conditions compared to supercritical CO2, which gives merit to experimentation using high throughput methods. __________________________ Ihttp://www.co2crc.com.au/research/ausprojects.html IIJ.

Continuous data protection (CDP), capturing all data writes at file or block level, is an enabling technology to storage systems against malicious attacks or user mistakes, because it allows each block data to be undoable. Most of existing data protection systems or prototypes are not real CDP ones because there is a data exposure between subsequent snapshots. Therefore they provide less granular recovery points. In addition, some products work either at file system level or at application level which lack general purpose. This paper presents the design, implementation, and performance of a new block level continuous data protection system, TH-CDP. Besides providing the basic functions of true CDP, TH-CDP provides virtual volume image at any point in time without affecting the production system. Another distinctive feature of TH-CDP is its checkpointing mechanism. By encapsulating the checkpoint information into I/O request packet queue, TH-CDP can take checkpoints without temporarily halting normal business processing or any incoming request. In addition, TH-CDP uses log-structured technique to store changed block data on raw disk, thereby speeding up both data writing and space recycling. Extensive experiments on file systems, databases using IOzone, and TPC-C benchmark show that TH-CDP can effectively improve the convenience of checkpointing and recovery assurance process.

Numerous mineral owners have rights to drain oil and gas from shared underground reservoirs, and mineral owners in many states may use the surface to access minerals without paying surface owners any damages, provided their use is reasonable. These mineral owners also use underground resources in a manner that precludes or enhances certain future subsurface uses, such as natural gas and carbon dioxide storage, geothermal development, or other mineral development. Further, drilling an oil or gas well can prevent future surface use -- for example, many municipalities in Texas prohibit building on top of or within a certain number of feet of an abandoned well. Yet current and potential future surface and subsurface users often have no voice, or a very limited voice, in the decision to drill. Within the regulatory sphere, local, state, regional, and federal governments have some voice in oil and gas governance, yet none exercise full regulatory authority over the externalities caused by this development, leading to a type of regulatory commons in which numerous actors have partial control over a regulated activity but leave certain gaps.This Article explores this complex array of rights and regulations from a commons-based perspective and suggests solutions. To allow oil and gas development while avoiding inefficient externalities, more types of property owners should have individually-defined rights to the subsurface resource and should be able to negotiate with mineral owners; surface owners should receive damages for mineral owners' use of the subsurface; or the rule of capture, which allows for rapid extraction of oil and gas from a common pool and potential over-use of valuable land at the surface, should be modified.

Many states have mandates to develop climate action plans, of which forest carbon is an important component, and planners need current information on forest carbon stocks and rates of change at relevant spatial scales. To this end, we examine rates of average annual change in live aboveground tree carbon in different forest type groups and provide state-wide and regional summaries of current live tree carbon stock and rates of change for the forests of the conterminous United States. Forest carbon summaries are presented in a format designed to meet the needs of managers, policymakers, and others requiring current estimates of aboveground live tree carbon at state and regional scales. Results Regional average aboveground live tree carbon stocks (represented on a per area basis) are generally between 40 and 75 tC/ha but range from 12.8 tC/ha in the Great Plains to 130 tC/ha in the Pacific Northwest West (west-side of Cascades). Regional average annual change in live aboveground tree carbon varies from a low of \u2212\u20090.18 mtC/ha/y in the Rocky Mountain South to a high value of 1.74 mtC/ha/y in Pacific Northwest West. For individual states, carbon per unit area varies widely, from a low of 11.9 tC/ha in Nevada to a high of 96.4 tC/ha in Washington, with half the states falling between 50 and 75 tC/ha.

To address these important issues, the National Energy Technology Laboratory has developed a unique facility to better understand the behavior of CO2 in aqueous environments under high pressure. In this device, individual CO2 drops are observed during suspension in a countercurrent flow of seawater and dissolution rates of the drops are obtained by direct measurement through highpressure windows. Dissolution rates have been obtained under a range of conditions that include those that exist in the deep ocean down to 3000 m. Similar data were also obtained with elevated levels of dissolved CO2 in the seawater that simulate the conditions that may occur near a release point. It was observed that stable hydrate shells would form if sufficient dissolved CO2 was present. A model was developed based on the dissolution rates obtained at different background concentrations of CO2 that allows calculation of mass transfer coefficients and apparent solubilities of CO2 at different temperatures and pressures. The impact of different background concentrations on the mass transfer coefficient was also investigated. The model also accounts for the impact of a hydrate coating on the drop. The apparent solubilities obtained from our study were found to be higher than literature data. Utilization of our data for modeling may be desired to predict the fate of CO2 released into aqueous environments like the deep ocean, since they were obtained under more realistic conditions. FOURTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION DOE/NETL May 2-5, 2005 CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS INTRODUCTION Nonatmospheric sequestration of carbon dioxide is the subject of great national and international concern (Carbon Sequestration, 1999). Large potential sinks include geologic formations, soils and vegetation, and the deep ocean. In both geologic and oceanic systems the CO2 is often in contact with water, seawater or brines. Understanding the behavior and fate of CO2 in such aqueous systems is important for developing many of the potential options and for understanding the impacts of seepage or leakage of CO2 into aqueous environments, such as unintentional release of CO2 from a sub-oceanic storage reservoir into the deep ocean. The behavior of CO2 in water and salt water has been addressed in previous work (Aya, et al.1996; Hirai, et al., 1996a, 1996b; Holder et al., 2001; Mori, et al, 1997; Teng, et al., 1996; Radhakrishnan, et al., 2003; Teng, et al., 1998b). An important issue that impacts research in cold aqueous systems under pressure is the possible formation of the ice-like CO2 hydrate. The hydrate may be beneficial in that it could potentially seal any unintentional releases from sub-oceanic storage reservoirs as the CO2 migrates through the cold ocean floor sediments. It could also influence the behavior of any CO2 that enters the ocean environment at depths below about 500 m. For example, if it forms a thin shell on a CO2 drop, it could slow the dissolution of the drop. At depths above about 2700 m, this hydrate-encased drop would rise to shallower depths than a drop without a hydrate shell, thus transporting the CO2 farther up the oceanic water column and likely reducing the time before the CO2 reenters the atmosphere (Warzinski and Holder, 1999). While the research mentioned above has greatly contributed to our understanding of the behavior of CO2 in aqueous systems, there is still some uncertainty with respect to the rates of dissolution and mass transfer associated with a CO2 drop in an under-saturated aqueous system and on the impact of hydrate on these processes. At the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) a unique device is being used to study the behavior of CO2 under simulated free rise or free sinking conditions (Warzinski et al., 2004; Haljasmaa et al., 2005). This device, the High-Pressure Water Tunnel Facility (HWTF), is currently being used to measure the rates of dissolution of CO2 drops and the impact of hydrate at various conditions of temperature, pressure, salinity, and dissolved CO2. In this paper, the dissolution rates for CO2 drops obtained in the HWTF are presented. They are then used to determine mass transfer coefficients for CO2 drop dissolution in seawater both in the absence and presence of hydrate. By varying the background concentrations of dissolved CO2, the solubility (or metastable solubility) of liquid CO2 in seawater has also been determined. This is especially useful when hydrate formation occurs on the surface of a liquid CO2 drop, which can make the measurement of CO2 solubility difficult, since the solid phase can be inadvertently mixed and sampled with the aqueous phase. There are limited data on the solubility of CO2 in seawater (Teng, et al, 1998b; Stewart, et al, 1970) compared to the extensive studies on the solubility of CO2 in water (Chapoy, et al., 2004; Diamond, et al, 2003; Anderson, 2002; Crovetto, 1991). The present study provides this information under conditions that attempt to simulate the natural behavior of CO2 as it enters the deep ocean, either through unintentional releases or through an engineered system. EXPERIMENTAL The basic operation of the HWTF has been previously described (Warzinski, et al., 2004; Haljasmaa et al., 2005). It basically consists of a flow loop that is used to stabilize a rising or sinking object (bubble, drop or solid particle)in a visual observation section using a countercurrent flow of water and internal flow conditioning elements that prevent the drop from contacting the walls in the device (Warzinski et al., 2000). It also incorporates automated systems for controlling the position of the object in viewing FOURTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION DOE/NETL May 2-5, 2005 CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS windows and for measuring and recording the size, shape and motion of the object. Pressures to 34.5 MPa are possible. The experimental data reported in this paper are for rising CO2 (99.5% purity) drops suspended in a downward flow of 35 salinity artificial seawater that was prepared following the recipe given by Millero (1996). The same CO2 was also dissolved into the artificial seawater to prepare solutions of seawater with various levels of dissolved CO2. RESULTS Dissolution data We have previously presented limited experimental results from the HWTF on the dissolution of CO2 drops in water (Warzinski et al, 2004) and seawater (Zhang et al., 2004). Here we report additional data for CO2 drops at simulated depths from 500 m to 2500 m, temperatures from 2C to 14C and at dissolved CO2 concentrations of 0 wt%, 2 wt%, 4 wt% and 4.6 wt%. These data are shown in Figures 1 through 4, respectively. For the data at 0 wt% and 2.0 wt% dissolved CO2, nearly all of the points in Figures 1 and 2, respectively, are the averages of the results for two or more individual drops. At the higher CO2 concentrations fewer replicate experiments were performed. The error bars in these Figures represent the standard deviation of the data and in some cases are smaller than the symbol size. The error bars for temperature represent the deviations between individual experiments. Within any given experiment the variations in temperature and pressure are typically less than \"0.1C and \"0.01 MPa (\"2-m depth, respectively. The dissolution rates generally decrease with decreasing temperature, increasing depth and increasing amounts of dissolved CO2. No stable hydrate formation was observed except at 2500 m simulated depth and 2.0C, although hydrate formation is possible at any of these depths at temperatures below 10C. The dissolution rate data obtained at 0 wt%, 2 wt%, 4 wt% and 4.6 wt% dissolved CO2 were fit to first and second order polynomials of the form: dR/dt = aT + bT + c. Table 1 gives the values for a, b and c and the sample coefficients of determination. As evidenced in these data, a linear correlation fits the individual data sets for 0 wt%, 2 wt% and 4 wt% very well with nearly all r values greater than 0.98. The data sets at 4.6 wt% were not described as well by a first order polynomial which gave r values for the three shallower depths less than 0.50. Inspection of the 4.6 wt% data shows that even though some curvature of the individual data sets is apparent, all of the dissolution rates are close to 1.5 \u03bcmol/cms indicating that the effects of pressure and temperature are minimal at this higher level of dissolved CO2. Also noteworthy is the fact that the only time a stable hydrate shell formed on a drop was at the highest level of dissolved CO2. The point in Figure 4 represents the average of three separate drops. The shell on these drops became visibly less thick with time, as evidenced by the change from a rough, translucent shell to a nearly transparent shell in a matter of minutes. While the presence of a hydrate shell may not be discernable from the transparency of the shell, our visual observations show that when a drop with a hydrate shell is present in the HWTF the drop surface is more rigid than in the absence of the shell. That is, it is subject to less distortion (wobbling) by the flow in the HWTF. Hydrate shells, not even transitory ones were observed on any of the drops other than that noted.

This is caused by CP congeners with the same nominal mass, but with five carbon atoms more and two chlorine atoms less; for example C11H1737Cl35Cl6\n(m/z\u00a0395.9) and C16H2935Cl5\n(m/z\u00a0396.1). This can lead to an overestimation of congener group quantity and/or of total CP concentration. The magnitude of this interference was studied by evaluating the change after mixing a SCCP standard and a MCCP standard 1+1 (S+MCCP mixture) and comparing it to the single standards. A quantification of the less abundant C16 and C17 congeners present in the MCCP standard was not possible due to interference from the major C11 and C12 congeners in the SCCPs. Also, signals for SCCPs (C10\u2013C12) with nine and ten chlorine atoms were mimicked by MCCPs (C15\u2013C17) with seven and eight chlorine atoms (for instance C10H12Cl10\nby C15H24Cl8). A similar observation was made for signals from C15\u2013C17 CPs with four and five chlorine atoms resulting from SCCPs (C10\u2013C12) with six and seven chlorine atoms (such as C15H28Cl4\nby C10H16Cl6) in the S+MCCP mixture. It could be shown that the quantification of the most abundant congeners (C11\u2013C14) is not affected by any interference. The determination of C10 and C15 congeners is partly disturbed, but this can be detected by investigating isotope ratios, retention time ranges and the shapes of the CP signals.

The contribution of harvested wood products (HWPs) to increasing carbon uptake has been recognised and approaches to quantifying this pool developed. In New Zealand, harvesting has more than doubled since 1990 while log exports have increased by a factor of 11 due to past afforestation and comparatively little expansion in domestic processing. This paper documents New Zealand\u2019s application of the IPCC approaches for reporting contributions of the HWP pool to net emissions, in order to meet international greenhouse gas inventory reporting requirements. We examine the implications of the different approaches and assumptions used in calculating the HWP contribution and highlight model limitations. Results Choice of system boundary has a large impact for a country with a small domestic market and significant HWP exports. Under the Production approach used for New Zealand\u2019s greenhouse gas inventory reporting, stock changes in planted forests and in HWPs both rank highly as key categories. The contribution from HWPs is even greater under the Atmospheric Flow approach, because emissions from exported HWPs are not included. Conversely the Stock Change approach minimises the contribution of HWPs because the domestic market is small. The use of country-specific data to backfill the time series from 1900 to 1960 has little impact but using country-specific parameters in place of IPCC defaults results in a smaller HWP sink for New Zealand. This is because of the dominance of plantation forestry based on a softwood mainly used in relatively short-lived products. Conclusions The NZ HWP Model currently meets international inventory reporting requirements. Further disaggregation of the semi-finished HWP end uses both within New Zealand and in export markets is required to improve accuracy. Product end-uses and lifespans need to be continually assessed to capture changes. More extensive analyses that include the benefits of avoided emissions through product substitution and life cycle emissions from the forestry sector are required to fully assess the contribution of forests and forest products to climate change mitigation and a low emissions future.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "e6a8e25483c61244d94dfff3d5377feb7e4cff7a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2896774918", "DOI": "10.1007/s10098-018-1630-3", "CorpusId": 104648803}, "title": "Environmental assessment of a combined heat and power plant configuration proposal with post-combustion CO2 capture for the Mexican oil and gas industry", "abstract": "Combined heat and power (CHP) plants retrofitted with post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) are discussed for the Mexican oil and gas industry using a life cycle assessment.

It has been accepted that the main objective of natural analogue studies is to predict the long-term performance of a natural CO2 reservoir to be extrapolated to the operation of a CO2 deep geological storage, but these studies can also provide valuable information to select a site for CO2 storage. Thus, the comprehensive study performed in this Spanish basin has allowed the establishment of a guide to be applied to other similar natural systems with deep saline aquifers that are able to store CO2. This guide comprises 5 phases: (1) the compilation of existing information from the site; (2) the geological and structural study of the natural CO2 reservoir; (3) the characterisation of the main components (waters\u2013rocks\u2013gases) of the natural CO2 reservoir; (4) the identification of analogies between the natural CO2 reservoir and a potential site for CO2 geological storage; and (5) the implications for the long-term behaviour and safety of a CO2 storage system.

For this reason, it has been considered convenient to go deeper into both the identification of analogies and the assessment of their performance in storing CO2.

This report deals with the development of a methodology for estimating cost-curves of carbon sequestration from afforestation activities and its combination with existing cost-curves of carbon abatement in the energy sector, with an application to the Latin American region. For deriving the carbon supply curves, a bottom-up approach is used where the costs of carbon sequestration are first estimated on individual grids (geo-referenced area of 50 \u00d7 50 km), which are aggregated in a single cost curve. In evaluating the carbon sequestration benefits of forests, we intend to capture the lifecycle of the sequestered carbon by accounting the carbon uptake during forest growth, the carbon emissions during the harvest periods, and the residual carbon storage in short-and longlived products. From a number of model runs we show that (i) the cumulative carbon sequestration by 2010 could amount to about one fourth of the yearly emissions in the region\u2019s energy sector, given a carbon price of US$20/tC, (ii) the Latin American region on its own could fulfil the Kyoto Protocol demand on Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) sinks for 2008-2012 at a carbon price of US$26-32/tC, and (iii) when the supply curves of afforestation and energy are combined, the total emission reductions in 2010 are at least 15% larger than in the case of the energy sector alone.

To perform this task properly, a suitable g eolo ical model is important, which simulates the geometry and petro-elastical properties of the different formations. In this work we integrate numerical simulators of CO 2-brine flow and seismic wave propagation to model and monitor CO2 storage in saline aquifers. We also build a petrophysical model of a shaly s andstone based on porosity and clay content and considering the variation of properties with pore pr essu e and fluid saturation. The pressure map before the injection of CO 2 is assumed to be hydrostatic for which a reference porosity map is defined. The permeability is assumed to be anisotropic and is obtained fr om first principles as a function of porosity and grain sizes. The density is the usual arithmetic a v rage of the sandy and shaly components. The numerical simulator of the CO 2-brine flow is based on the Black-Oil formulation for two phase flow in porous media, which uses the Pressure-Volume-T e perature (PVT) behavior as a simplified thermodynamic model. The propagation of waves in porous media is described using a viscoelastic model that takes into account the dispersion and attenuation eff ects due to the presence of heterogeneities in the fluid and solid phase properties. We introduce the P-w ave attenuation following White\u2019s model of porous layers alternately saturated with brine and CO 2. S-wave attenuation is considered with a mechanism related to the P-wave one. Numerical examples of CO 2 injection and time-lapse seismics in the Utsira formation at the Sleipner field are analyzed.

This natural CCS process allows us to exploit the physical properties of straw and timber to build with carbon. The amount of CO2 banked into the system is more than is emitted through its making, resulting in a carbon negative footprint.

The ISOBIO project proposes an innovative strategy to bring bio-based construction materials into the mainstream. The use of bio-based aggregates for construction, which include insulation materials, hygrothermal and moisture buffering materials, binders, sol-gel and bio-based resins, will help create a decarbonised and healthier built environment.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "47c73733ac713f60c631140dc3b8f8455c1ba091", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3099653746", "DOI": "10.2118/202335-ms", "CorpusId": 229233469}, "title": "CO2 Storage with Enhanced Gas Recovery CS-EGR in Conventional and Unconventional Gas Reservoirs in Australia", "abstract": "\n Excessive greenhouse gas emission and natural gas shortage need to be tackled urgently nationally and globally. In this context, Carbon Capture Storage and Utilization (CCUS) has been proposed to: (1) mitigate the global warming by removing carbon from the atmosphere and, at the same time, (2) create value/reduce the cost by utilizing them for production. CO2 Storage with Enhanced Gas Recovery (CS-EGR) is well fit for the purpose of CCUS. This paper analyses the feasibility of CS-EGR in Australia by characterizing reservoir rock and fluid properties from both conventional and unconventional gas reservoirs, and by modelling the process of CO2 injection, gas production, and CO2 storage.\n This paper discusses technical aspects of injection and storage of CO2 and the behaviours of CO2 and methane together with enhancement of gas production. Although both conventional and unconventional gas reservoirs are covered, the emphasis is given to the unconventional gas. CO2 is more preferentially adsorbed to shale or coal than CH4, so the injected CO2 will displace CH4 which then can be recovered. It is also miscible with natural gas and is good for re-pressurizing reservoir. However, these processes are highly influenced by many factors, such as reservoir temperature and pressure, total organic content (TOC), porosity, permeability, pore size (distribution), injection operation, mineralogy, fracture, fluids and so on. Numerical simulation is a perfect tool to study how different parameters interact with each other and eventually affect the efficiency of CS-EGR.\n The authors undertake geological and petrophysical characterization of target formations in Australia. It is then followed by numerical modelling which takes consideration of reservoir characterization data and interaction between CO2, CH4, H2O and rock. The sensitivity analysis investigates the performance of CS-EGR at different scenarios and identifies the critical factors. It is worthwhile to mention that two gas injection methods, gas flooding, huff'n'puff, (or cyclic gas injection), are studied and compared.\n Based on previous studies, this paper moves a step further by: (1) incorporating reservoir characterization data from Australia gas field in numerical modelling and exploring the feasibility of CO2 Storage with Enhanced Gas Recovery in Australia; (2) investigating both unconventional gas reservoirs and conventional reservoirs and makes a comparison between them; (3) comparing two injection methods for all different reservoirs; (4) performing sensitive analysis of multiple parameters identified from analysis and literature. CS-EGR is promising in achieving \"net-zero emission\" for Australia.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "c8dc87966f37c3807a0284a2819e60ebf55954fd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2985168198", "DOI": "10.1080/1536383X.2019.1686616", "CorpusId": 209713017}, "title": "Characterization of amorphous hydrocarbon CDx films (x \u223c 0.5) for energy storage applications", "abstract": "Abstract Smooth hydrocarbon films formed on the vacuum chamber walls in tokamaks under the erosion of graphite elements during deuterium plasma discharges are the main accumulators of hydrogen isotopes in carbon matrices. Therefore, they can be considered as a promising material for hydrogen storage applications. In the present work, such hydrocarbon CDx films (x \u223c 0.5) produced in T-10 tokamak (NRC Kurchatov Institute, Russia) were studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), NEXAFS and EXAFS spectroscopies together with thermal desorption (TD) for the films\u2019 characterization and estimation of their hydrogen storage capacity. The C 1s X-ray absorption spectra of the CDx films were recorded for the first time using the BESSY II storage ring facility (Germany). The obtained NEXAFS spectra were found typical for CK-spectra of sp3 + sp2 hydrocarbon systems with a high H/C ratio. The role of Fe impurities from the tokamak chamber walls was elucidated as a catalytic effect \u201cfacilitating\u201d the thermal desorption of hydrogen (deuterium) from CDx films. The Fe K-edge spectra allowed to confirm a fractal (self-affined) structure of CDx films, with a minimal sp2 fractal aggregate \u223c2\u20133\u2009nm, and formation of 3D carbon sp3 + sp2 network, accumulated a large number of H-isotopes and CxHy hydrocarbons. It was found that the H storage and thermal desorption properties of the CDx films can be improved by their inherent Fe impurities, capable to reduce the barrier of TD and to increase the H/C storage capacity by several times even at room temperature.", "year": 2020}]}
