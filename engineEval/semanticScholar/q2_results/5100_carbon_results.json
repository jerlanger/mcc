It controls the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by precipitating the magnesium and calcium carbonates. The process is slow and takes place over a long period of time. However, if this process is accelerated, the atmospheric CO2 can be removed in sufficient volumes at a faster rate and converted to bicarbonates thus mitigating the greenhouse effect. A geochemistry-based capture and sequestration process that reacts CO2 with water to produce a carbonic acid solution is one of the methods to understand this phenomenon. This carbonic acid solution is then reacted with carbonate rocks to precipitate bicarbonates. The rate of reaction depends upon the temperature, flow rate and particle size. In the present study, the accelerated weathering of limestone was carried out using different sizes of limestone cuttings (4 mm, 500, 250, 100 and 50 \u00b5m) under different flow rates of carbonic acid (0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 L/min) for a duration of 2 h at a constant temperature of 80 \u00b0C. SEM and elemental analysis were done before and after the experiment. Results from the experiment showed that the highest flow rate (1.5 L/min) exhibits the greatest weight loss. This weight loss is brought about by the dissolution of calcium to release bicarbonate and carbonate ions. EDX analysis shows a reduction in both calcite and dolomite indicating dissolution of these two minerals. Acid attack on the samples forms dissolution patterns which are visible in SEM images. The principle mode of sequestration in limestone formation is ionic trapping. CO2 trapped in this way in the form of bicarbonate solution can be safely discharged in a water body or reservoir for storage.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "1b8bfa3811d6f0b79ba279aa3370bbd201c23015", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2754435762", "CorpusId": 15884456}, "title": "Power system and carbon capture under climate policy: a water impact analysis with TIAM-FR", "abstract": "An increasing body of literature assesses the attainability of stringent CO2 mitigation targets (e.g. van Vuuren et al., 2007), depending on a wide range of different reduction options, and the technology 'readiness' of advanced technologies, in particular the industrial scale of carbon capture and storage (CCS)and the combination of bio-energy, carbon capture and geologic storage (BECCS).

Various capture techniques have been developed for capturing CO2 from post combustion emission. One of the new approaches considered for capturing CO2 and hence reducing to atmospheric emissions is based on gas hydrate (crystallization) technology. The basis of the technology is the selective partition of the target component between the hydrate phase and the gaseous phase. It is expected that CO2 is preferentially trapped and encaged into the hydrate crystal phase compared to the other components. Previous study found that the gas/hydrate equilibrium pressure and temperature for the fl ue gas mixture in the range of 7.6 MPa and 11.0 MPa at 274 K and 277 K respectively, are inappropriate to the downstream oil and gas industrial reality because the operating cost will be expensive to compress the gas to the hydrate formation pressure. Suitable hydrate promoters including Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate (SDS) can be used to achieve moderate hydrate formation pressure and energy consumption appropriate to the industrial reality. In the presence of THF and SDS about 62.3 Nm3/m3 CO2 hydrate can be formed at 30 bar pressure and 274 to 277 K temperature within around 15 minutes reaction time.Many experiments result indicates that continuous hydrates formation will be feasible for scale-up to industrial settings including downstream oil and gas industry emission reduction if the technology assures an optimal contact between gas and liquid phases plus the proper hydrate promoter.

The document outlines the basic technology and the operational differences between the REO kiln and a conventional cement plant. We trust that you will find the results as exciting as we do and look forward moving this next generation cement technology to market. The REO kiln represents a paradigm shift in cement production that aims to capture virtually all greenhouse gas emissions from the facility while increasing production and energy efficiency. The process will consume more electrical energy, for oxygen production and carbon dioxide compression, but we anticipate significant reductions in category pollutants such as acid gases and particulates. We thank you for your support in this endeavor and look forward to future collaborations. Please do not hesitate to contact us if we may be of further assistance. The cement industry is challenged with developing methods for reducing anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere at a cost that does not suffocate growth. While some technologies can be retrofitted to existing plants, we look forward to the next generation of cement plant that improve efficiency while significantly reducing emissions of greenhouse gases and other category pollutants. Such a facility could be based on oxygen combustion and would represent a paradigm shift from existing technology. The objective of this report is to propose a roadmap for this next generation plant and to highlight potential areas of future research. We do not presume to think that we have identified every opportunity and challenge associated with these plants. Furthermore, we welcome comments and constructive criticism, and believe that the scientific and cement community can move forward together in a cooperative and productive manner.

The approach followed involves the configuration of a mixed integer linear programming optimization model, in which the objective function is to minimize the total cost of the CCS chain, considering constraints of mass balance, injection wells, intermediate storage sizing, flow and routing. The model functionality is illustrated through a case study based on a Norwegian CCS chain which is assessed for a planning horizon of 30 years, assigned in five-year long intervals. The model adopts the methodology developed previously by the authors for pipeline transport and geological storage of CO2 and introduces CO2 ship transport and intermediate storage at two design pressures (7 and 15 bar). It also includes a newly introduced CO2 conditioning step (compression and liquefaction) and a further injection mode, directly from ship. For the CCS chain analyzed, it is found that higher CO2 supply provides economy of scale gains, thus lower levelized cost. Pressure design for ship transportation plays a significant role on the cost of the chain with the trade-off between low conditioning costs and higher transport cost. In the Norwegian CCS case analyzed, individual pipelines from a single hub to each storage site are more economical than a single trunk-line with multiple connections to injection sites.

Woody encroachment and its potential impacts (e.g., livestock forage, wildlife habitat, hydrological cycling) have led to widespread brush management. Although woody plants may have substantial impacts on soils, uncertainty remains regarding woody encroachment and brush management influences on carbon (C) pools. Surface C pools (shallow soils and litter) may be particularly dynamic in response to encroachment and brush management. However, we have limited understanding of spatiotemporal patterns of surface C responses or how surface pools respond relative to aboveground C, litter, roots, and deep soil organic C. Spatial variability and lack of basic ecological data in woody-encroached dryland ecosystems present challenges to filling this data gap. We assessed the impact of western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis) encroachment and removal on C pools in a semi-arid sagebrush ecosystem. We used spatially-intensive sampling to create sub-canopy estimates of surface soil C (0\u201310\u00a0cm depth) and litter C pools that consider variation in tree size/age and sub-canopy location for live juniper and around stumps that were cut 7\u00a0years prior to sampling. We coupled the present size distribution of junipers with extensive existing allometric information about juniper in this region to estimate how landscape-level C pools would change through time under future management and land cover scenarios. Juniper encroachment and removal leads to substantial changes in C pools. Best-fit models for surface soil and litter C included positive responses to shrub basal diameter and negative responses to increasing relative distance from the bole to dripline. Juniper removal led to a net loss of surface C as a function of large decreases in litter C and small increases in surface soil C. At the landscape scale, deep soil C was the largest C pool (77\u00a0Mg\u00a0C\u00a0ha\u22121), with an apparent lack of sensitivity to management. Overall, encroachment led to substantial increases in C storage over time as juniper size increased (excluding deep soil C, ecosystem C pools increased from 13.5 to 30.2\u00a0Mg\u00a0C\u00a0ha\u22121 with transition from sagebrush-dominated to present encroachment levels). The largest pool of accumulation was juniper aboveground C, with important other pools including juniper roots, litter, and surface soil C. Woody encroachment and subsequent brush management can have substantive impacts on ecosystem C pools, although our data suggest the spatiotemporal patterns of surface C pools need to be properly accounted for to capture C pool responses. Our approach of coupling spatially-intensive surface C information with shrub distribution and allometric data is an effective method for characterizing ecosystem C pools, offering an opportunity for filling in knowledge gaps regarding woody encroachment and brush management impacts on local-to-regional ecosystem C pools.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "e8805e7dd5a518f420eae5447833cb08ce943725", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 139088767}, "title": "A Chemical Engineering Perspective on the Challenges and Opportunities of Delivering Carbon Capture and Storage at Commercial Scale", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "a489a2409d715b64320c30cfc8ad84f008e3fa00", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3143576283", "DOI": "10.1063/5.0045051", "CorpusId": 233587227}, "title": "Pore-scale simulation of miscible viscous fingering with dissolution reaction in porous media", "abstract": "Global climate change is happening but may be mitigated by the technology of geological carbon dioxide ( CO 2) sequestration. To gain comprehensive insights into this approach, we perform pore-scale simulations of displacement between two miscible fluids in porous media using a new multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann model. This study marks the first attempt to investigate viscous fingering dynamics in miscible displacement, considering the coexistence of viscosity contrast and dissolution reaction. Simulation results capture different fingering patterns that depend on dissolution (Damkohler number Da), diffusion (Peclet number Pe), and viscosity contrast (viscosity ratio R). From simulations of unstable viscous flows, dissolution is found to delay fingering onset, slow down fingering propagation, and inhibit or reinforce the late-stage fingering intensity. In simulations with stable viscosity contrasts, the displacement features fingering phenomena when dissolution is fast enough. In addition, we conduct a parametric study to assess the impact of Pe, R, and Da. The results suggest that increasing Pe or R destabilizes fingering, but increasing Da first suppresses and gradually intensifies fingering. Finally, for every fixed Da, we determine the phase boundary between stable and unstable regimes in a Pe\u2013R phase plane. A unified scaling law is developed to approximate boundary lines obtained under different Da values. By comparing reactive and nonreactive cases, we classify four distinct regimes: stable, unstable, reactive stable, and reactive unstable.

Through an in situ adsorption/desorption process the displaced methane (CH4) is produced and the adsorbed CO2 is permanently stored. This process is called Enhanced Coal Bed Methane recovery (ECBM) and it is a technique under investigation as a possible approach to the geological storage of CO2 in a carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) system. ECBM recovery is not yet a mature technology, in spite of the growing number of pilot and field tests worldwide that have shown its potential and highlighted its difficulties. The problems encountered are largely due to the heterogeneous nature of coal and its complex interaction with gases. These issues, which represent the motivation of this research work, need to be addressed both at laboratory and field test scales. The aim of this thesis is therefore to develop experimental and modeling tools that are able to provide a comprehensive characterization of coal required first to understand the mechanisms acting during the process of injection and storage and secondly to assess its potential for an ECBM operation. In particular, sorption data of CO2, CH4 and N2 on several coals from different coal mines worldwide have been measured at conditions typically encountered in coal seams. CO2 maximum sorption capacity per unit mass of dry coal has been found to range between 5% and 14% weight and to depend on coal rank in a non-monotonic way. Moreover, for a specific coal, competitive sorption isotherms of the binary and ternary mixtures of these gases have been obtained, showing that CO2 adsorbs always more than CH4, and CH4 more than N2. This property is of key importance for ECBM application. In order to investigate the coal volumetric behavior upon exposure to an adsorbing gas, two approaches have been followed. In the first, the utilization of a visualization technique allowed to measure the unconstrained expansion of a coal disc, confirming that indeed coal swells when exposed to a gas that is able to adsorb on its surface and penetrate into its structure, whereas exposure", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "4631aaf7fb6a25ae868164c8a42213a043e3ba99", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2401998162", "CorpusId": 114293041}, "title": "Comprehensive commitment to the work on carbon capture and potential CO2-chains in 2007", "abstract": "-The Norwegian government places \ngreat emphasis on capture and storage of CO2 as a measure to reach \nthe targets set for Norway in the Kyoto Protocol.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "091dbad2a4e0ea9a1d2c80bfa873777fb3f00733", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2110185115", "DOI": "10.7846/JKOSMEE.2012.15.3.263", "CorpusId": 111166348}, "title": "Analysis of Modality and Procedures for CCS as CDM Project and Its Countmeasures", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide, emitted by human activities since the industrial revolution, is regarded as a major contributor of global warming.

The inclusion of CCS as clean development mechanism (CDM) project activities has been considered at UNFCCC as financial incentive mechanisms for those developing countries that may wish to deploy the CCS. Although the Conference of the Parties serving as the Meeting of the Parties to the UNFCCC`s Kyoto Protocol (CMP), at Cancun in December 2010, decided that CCS is eligible as CDM project activities, the issues identified in decision 2/CMP.5 should be addressed and resolved in a satisfactory manner.

The CMP, by its decision 7/CMP.6, invited Parties to submit their views to the secretariat of Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA), SBSTA prepared a draft modalities and procedure by exchanging views of Parties through workshop held in Abu Dhabi, UAE (September 2011).

According to the adopted modalities and procedures for CCS as CDM project activities, it is possible to implement relevant CCS projects in Non-Annex I countries, including Korea, as long as legal and regulatory frameworks are established.

The nuclear option is especially debatable - issues such as waste management and decommissioning receive much attention. In addition, the many stakeholders interested in nuclear power display very divergent views on its sustainability. Since the turn of the century, nuclear power has received much attention globally, with many nations? governments taking consideration of the potential benefits of new nuclear adoption. Conversely, the Fukushima nuclear disaster has led to new nuclear resistance in other nations, such as Germany, where plans have been made to stop nuclear power generation completely. This research aims to help inform the debate on nuclear power and the future UK electricity mix. A multi-criteria decision support framework (developed by the SPRIng Project) has been used for these purposes, taking into account technical, economic, environmental and social criteria.The methodology used in this work has involved: stakeholder consultation; use of future electricity scenarios; sustainability assessment of current and future electricity options (Pressurised Water Reactor, European Pressurised Reactor, European Fast Rector, coal, gas, solar and wind power, and coal carbon capture and storage [CCS] power); assessment of future electricity scenarios based on both sustainability impacts and stakeholder (expert and public) preferences for the sustainability indicators and electricity technologies. The sustainability assessment of future nuclear power options and coal CCS power have been carried out here for the first time in a UK-specific context.Based on the public and expert opinions on the importance of different sustainability indicators, results of the scenario analysis suggest that the scenario with a high penetration of low-carbon technologies (nuclear [60%] and offshore wind power [40%]) is the most sustainable. For the sample considered in this study, this finding is not sensitive to different stakeholder and public opinions on the importance of the sustainability indicators. However, when the stakeholder preferences for individual technologies are considered, scenarios with high penetration of renewables (26-40% solar and 20-48% wind) become the preferred options. This is due to the favourable stakeholder opinion on solar and wind power. In that case, the scenario with high penetration of nuclear is never the preferred option due to the low to moderate stakeholder preference for nuclear power.Therefore, the results from this research suggest that the ?sustainability? of different electricity options and scenarios is highly dependent on stakeholder preferences and priorities. Thus, for successful future deployment of these options and implementation of energy policy measures, transparency of information on the impacts of electricity options is key in ensuring that stakeholder opinions are founded in the actual rather than the perceived impacts of these options.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "740b99883a707ca4a6d725244bdd8693e2ec7ed0", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/ac13f1", "CorpusId": 237292537}, "title": "Reducing CO2 emissions by targeting the world\u2019s hyper-polluting power plants", "abstract": "Combusting fossil fuels to produce electricity is the single largest contributor to sector-level, anthropogenic carbon pollution.

The results show that Finland can achieve the 85\u201395% emission reduction target by 2050 through different pathways. Critical factors are the increase in efficiency in energy use throughout society, a significant increase in the use of renewable energy, electrification of the energy system, and the possibility to use carbon capture and storage (CCS) in bioenergy production and industrial processes. All analysed pathways show that economic welfare measured by GDP will increase. Technological development is the most important driver behind the growth.

The developed cycle of a negative CO2 emission power plant allows the production of electricity using gasified sewage sludge as a main fuel. The negative emission can be achieved by the use this type of fuel which is already a \u201czero-emissive\u201d energy source. Together with carbon capture installation, there is a possibility to decrease CO2 emission below the \u201czero\u201d level. Developed models of a novel gas cycle which use selected codes allow the prediction of basic parameters of thermodynamic cycles such as output power, efficiency, combustion composition, exhaust temperature, etc. The paper presents results of thermodynamic analysis of two novel cycles, called PDF0 and PFD1, by using different thermodynamic codes. A comparison of results obtained by three different codes offered the chance to verify results because the experimental data are currently not available. The comparison of predictions between three different software in the literature is something new, according to studies made by authors. For gross efficiency (54.74%, 55.18%, and 52.00%), there is a similar relationship for turbine power output (155.9 kW, 157.19 kW, and 148.16 kW). Additionally, the chemical energy rate of the fuel is taken into account, which ultimately results in higher efficiencies for flue gases with increased steam production. A similar trend is assessed for increased CO2 in the flue gas. The developed precise models are particularly important for a carbon capture and storage (CCS) energy system, where relatively new devices mutually cooperate and their thermodynamic parameters affect those devices.

Recently, the emphasis of NASA's plans has changed to focus on the prolonged pioneering of space, rather than focusing on a single crewed mission as the ultimate goal. A sustainable, pioneering vision of space would include in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) in multiple forms and at multiple destinations: atmospheric capture of Mars CO2 and/or volatiles for consumables and propellants, regolith for bulk and refined materials, and in-situ manufacturing at the Moon, Mars, and other bodies. These resources would enable a reduction in the logistical needs from Earth for future missions, thus preparing the way for a sustained presence on Mars. Although the EMC initially relies only on propellant production for the Mars ascent vehicle via ISRU, one of its primary objectives is to prospect at every EMC destination to understand the potential for ISRU; this will permit true pioneering to be enabled after the first crew arrives at Mars. Recent and ongoing analysis has considered the possible prospecting measurements that can be performed at the asteroid returned to cis-lunar space by the Asteroid Robotic Redirect Mission (ARRM), at the lunar surface, at Phobos and Deimos, and on the surface of Mars to identify available resources for future use. These opportunities will be available on missions currently in the Evolvable Mars Campaign construct, and will also facilitate the testing and demonstration of resource acquisition, processing, storage, and useage technologies that can play a role in later missions. This analysis has also led to the identification of several objectives that should be targeted during the missions building up to and including the initial crewed missions. These objectives are mapped to strategies for incorporating ISRU to support resource cycle closure and reduce mass requirements from Earth. This analysis has yielded engineering constraints, based on ISRU, that impact the evaluation of landing sites for missions to the surface of Mars. The terrain of a particular site must be sufficiently flat to permit ISRU systems, as well as ancillary systems such as power and propellant storage tanks, to be landed, moved into position, set up, and operated. Water must be accessible in a form that can be acquired via ISRU, in quantities that align with demands. The chosen method of acquiring and processing water should align with the available resources at a particular site, and that site must have sufficient quantities to meet the requirements (based on crew consumables and propellant demands). Lower altitude landing sites are preferred, as the increase in density can facilitate carbon dioxide acquisition from the atmosphere. Another preference is for sites with a greater ability to move regolith for civil engineering purposes; for example, this would be conducive to both bulk regolith uses (such as the manufacture of berms), and processed regolith uses (such as microwave sintering).", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "ff55a475bfce5d0c73326689fa31ce176384e7a9", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.29017/scog.32.3.855", "CorpusId": 247558865}, "title": "Carbon Capture And Storage (Ccs) - Enhanced Oil Recovery (Eor): Global Potential In Indonesia", "abstract": "Total global CO2 emissions from fossil-fuel will still increase in the next ten decades.

The model was first developed as a central presentation tool, later into an integrated assessment source-to-sink matching tool (based on the \u2018String of Pearls\u2019 framework), and continues to evolve to give regional summaries for large-scale carbon sequestration potential cost and performance metrics. The model\u2019s development is part of the larger Southwest Regional Partnership on Carbon Sequestration consisting of over 20 organizations, including geological surveys, national labs, federal and state agencies, and is one of seven such partnerships organized by the National Energy Technology Laboratory. The Integrated Assessment (IA) model development team at Sandia National Laboratories continues to expand and refine the model as the larger project continues to include additional source and sink data, technology assessments, and looks to employ increasingly standardized cost metrics. Additionally, the model is able to help decision makers (e.g., policy analysts and interested energy companies) determine where a CO 2 source (e.g., power plant) could be built given a set of planning constraints based on current power plant locations, sink availability, and existing pipeline infrastructure right-of-ways. The working results indicate that the cost of capturing carbon dioxide is by far the majority of a potential project\u2019s overall capital cost. For example, the capture, transportation and storage-associated cost breakdown of a plant in northern New Mexico may be 95%, 2% and 3% of the initial cost estimate, respectively. The IA also develops overarching results such as regional CO 2 sequestration totals, relative cost issues, and sink lifetimes across an initial fiftyyear time horizon. The initial results indicate the region may support anywhere from several decades to over ten thousand years\u2019 worth of CO 2 sequestration potential capacity depending upon the assumptions regarding CO 2 source and sink resources. To sequester this much CO 2, however, may have substantial parasitic energy penalties ranging from 15 to 40% associated with capturing the CO 2 from, for example, power plants. The IA team, as part of the larger SWP, continues to include additional and more refined capture cost data from a larger working group across all of the regional partnerships in an effort to develop a more \u2018seamless story\u2019 for carbon sequestration at a high level. These standardization efforts also allow for common technological progress to be included in the partnership\u2019s modeling efforts to address the cost and energy penalty issues. Ultimately, however, many of the costs will be highly site-specific for power plant-scale carbon sequestration projects.

More land will need to be brought into cultivation in order to provide the same amount of food if the intensity of farming is reduced and the resultant loss of ecosystem services (ES) outweighs the reduction in other burdens. Nevertheless, losses of nutrients, especially nitrogen (N), from agriculture are a serious concern and the current cost of the environmental footprint of agriculture is significant compared with the value of the food it produces.

In this context, this thesis aimed at testing the feasibility and identifying the essential limiting factors relevant for an up-scaled waste treatment process based on biological nitrogen removal (BNR). To evaluate the treatment of common solvents, aerobic and anoxic biodegradability of 9 amines were assessed by screening tests. Aerobic biodegradability was estimated by the OECD standard test. Anoxic biodegradability was estimated by a new batch test in syringes with biofilm carriers, measuring volume expansion due to produced N2. Results showed striking differences in aerobic (fresh and seawater) and anoxic biodegradability. The anoxic syringe test identified easily, slowly and not biodegradable amines. Monoethanolamine (MEA) and MEA-based reclaimer (RW) waste were successfully treated in moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs). The performance of postand predenitrification was compared, whereas pre-denitrification was identified as the preferred choice of method. Notably, MEA and RW could then serve as a sole carbon source. Essential inhibitory factors were identified by comparing nitrifying activity of MBBRs with or without exposure to organic loading while monitoring the population by pyrosequencing. Organic loading led to heterotrophic enriched and nitrifying MBBRs with 80% efficiency. Nitrification was inhibited at amine concentrations ranging from 9 to 120 mM, while denitrification was stimulated at concentrations up to 100 mM. Heterotrophic enriched nitrifying MBBRs were 5-20 times more sensitive to MEA or organics.

Several approaches to limit the release of CO2 have been investigated and are gradually being implemented. One approach is the introduction of renewable energy, such as solar or wind power. However, as fossil fuels will still remain the mainstay of energy production over the next few decades, carbon capture and storage (CCS), the capture and sequestration of CO2 under the sea or in disused gas and oil wells, is viewed by many as an important way to limit man-made climate change. Notwithstanding, the permanence of stored CO2 in the Earth\u2019s crust for many thousand years is problematic, as the whole process is very energy consuming and the risk of deadly accidental leaks is very high. An alternative to sequestration is presently being investigated at the IASS (Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies) within the framework of the Earth, Energy and Environment \u2013 E3 Cluster, i.e., the combination of CO2 with hydrogen, obtained from natural gas (methane (CH4)) by pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is a procedure that allows the capture of carbon (C) in pure form as solid carbon black, which can subsequently either be used industrially or safely stored. This concept is aimed at circumventing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when utilizing CH4 resources either as natural gas or in the form of clathrates, of which huge reserves, exceeding natural gas reserves are expected to exist. The hydrogen (H2) and the already spent CO2 from fossil burning can be combined to form methanol. Methanol as a liquid fuel, either used directly or converted into a higher hydrocarbon, can replace oil in applications such as fuel for transport or as the starting material in the manufacture of many chemicals now derived from oil.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "09c68b55b2773782a9b6dd66b9caeb315f5372b9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2388677619", "CorpusId": 34011860}, "title": "Scaling and Cost Dynamics of Pollution Control Technologies: Some Historical Examples", "abstract": "The past forty years have seen significant diffusion of end-of-pipe pollution control devices as numerous developed countries have sought to reduce local air pollutants from coal-fired power.

This well is located 13 km away from the injection point of the Tomakomai CCS project and 21 km from the epicenter of September 6th, 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake (M 6.7).

Owing to these interesting properties, compounds derived from orthocarborane have received a great deal of attention as promising materials in a wide range of applications, such as catalysis, hybrid materials, optoelectronic materials, doping agents in conducting polymers, potentiometric sensors, and boron-neutron-capture therapy (BNCT) . Whilst a number of studies on the design and synthesis of ortho-carborane-based compounds have focused on small molecular systems, polymers bearing carborane moieties are recently attracting great interest because the incorporation of carborane moieties into a polymer backbone could lead to the modulation of the electronic and optical properties of the polymer. Although the majority of polymeric carboranes developed so far have been utilized in main-chain, conjugate polymers, the development of side-chain polymers has rarely been reported; this scarcity is in spite of various advantages of this type of polymer including the ability to control the polymer architecture in terms of molecular weight, functionality, and the degree of incorporation that may lead to intriguing properties. In this regard, polyolefins with pendant ortho-carboranemoieties can be considered as a novel class of such sidechain carboranyl polymers. As single-site catalytic systems based on Group 4 organometallic complexes have been an effective and straightforward method for the preparation of functionalized polyolefins, it could be anticipated that the catalytic (co)polymerization of a-olefins bearing electron-deficient, bulky carborane groups may lead to the production of carboranyl polymers with well-defined structures. To this end, the copolymerization of ethylene with w-orthocarboranyl-a-olefin as a co-monomer using a [Me2SiACHTUNGTRENNUNG(h5C5Me4) ACHTUNGTRENNUNG(h1-N-tBu)TiCl2] (CGC)/methylaluminoxane (MAO) catalytic system was explored to develop a carboranefunctionalized polyethylene. In particular, it was found that the resulting polymer displayed not only photoluminescence under UV irradiation but also luminescence quenching in the presence of nucleophilic anions, thus revealing potential chemodosimetric sensing properties. Herein, the synthesis, characterization, and luminescent properties of polyethylene with side-chain ortho-methyl-carboranes are described. The ortho-carborane-substituted a-olefin, 1-methyl-2-(oct7-en-1-yl)-closo-1,2-carborane (1) was employed as a co-monomer. Carborane 1 was prepared from the reaction of 8bromo-1-octene in the presence of a catalytic amount of lithium iodide and the lithium salt generated in situ from 1-methyl-ortho-carborane and nBuLi in good yield after purification (70 %). The identity of 1 was confirmed by multinuclear NMR spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy. Whilst the H and C NMR spectra showed the expected resonances corresponding to the methyl and the octenyl substituents at the 1and 2-carbon positions of ortho-carborane, respectively, the B NMR signals detected in the region of d 4~ 10 ppm in a 1:1:2:2:4 ratio confirmed the presence of a closo-carborane cage. The copolymerization reactions of ethylene and 1 were achieved at different co-monomer concentrations using a CGC/MAO catalytic system at 75 8C under atmospheric ethylene pressure (Scheme 1).

There are numerous forecasts for national electric energy demand made by various institutions and authors. All of them (until 2030) assume electric energy production on the basis of primary stable energy carriers, thus, hard coal and lignite. These carriers are burdensome for the environment, since they are characterized by excessive greenhouse gases emission. The growing demand for direct energy, in accordance with ecological conditions, will require the use of clean technologies as well as disposal and deposition of CO2 \u2013 that is, CCS technologies (Carbon Capture and Storage). Since Poland joined the European Union in 2004, we have to face and prepare for all the changes which the European Commission has planned for the EU countries. The essential issue is the reduction of greenhouse gases, especially carbon dioxide. There are many technologies allowing to capture CO2 from the stream of gases, and consequently, its sequestration by means of storage in the oceans, deep geological layers or mineral carbonation. In 2006 the EU\uf02d27 emitted greenhouse gases in the total amount of more than 5.14 mld ton of CO2 equivalent. The greatest emittant of greenhouse gases in the power economy is the power industry, which emitted 1.59 mld ton of CO2 equivalent. The emission of greenhouse gases in Poland amounted to 400.5 mln ton of CO2 equivalent, out of which 330 mln ton is CO2 emission. The international community \u2013 the UN, the EU and many developed countries \u2013 already in 1990s (and earlier), intended to counteract the negative impact of greenhouse gases and dust emission. The problem of the environment protection is presently a matter of great importance, as far as the strategy of global economy development. It has been the subject-matter of numerous conventions, protocols, conferences, directives, regulations and etc. Polish power industry and energo-chemical industry in 2008 were entitled to emit about 201 mln ton of CO2 (additional in the reserves for the new investments).

Using a new DOSCOE (Dispatch-optimized system cost of electricity) model, we generalize System LCOE. DOSCOE can handle any mixture of dispatchable and non-dispatchable sources. It can analyze systems which contain storage, have legacy infrastructure, or have imposed policies. DOSCOE thus updates System LCOE to be applicable to more realistic electricity grid models. DOSCOE uses a linear program to find the capacity and generation mix which yields minimum LCOE. Running this linear program multiple times yields System LCOE curves. DOSCOE shows that to cost-effectively remove the last 10-20% of fossil fuels requires a moderate price on carbon and either low-cost nuclear power or carbon capture and sequestration.

Forest carbon growth rates begin to slow before the age of 100 years with little to no growth after 100 years. Source: Lippke et al, 2011 The role of forests in carbon and climate mitigation may seem to be very straightforward. Since trees capture carbon as they grow and forests store massive quantities of it, it is easy to conclude that trees and forests should be treated as carbon sinks and left alone. But this kind of thinking reflects an incomplete understanding of the role of forests in carbon mitigation. In reality, forests have multiple roles to play in carbon mitigation, and forest management can help to optimize those roles (Bowyer et al, 2011). A range of recent studies of forest carbon relationships have argued that a policy of active and responsible forest management is more effective in capturing and storing atmospheric carbon than a policy of hands-off management that precludes periodic harvests and use of wood products (Fahey et al 2009, Lippke et al 2011, Perez-Garcia et al 2005, Society of American Foresters 2011).

In this work, the first-principles calculations were performed to investigate the adsorption behaviors of CO2, H2, N2 and CH4 on the penta-BN2 monolayer with different charge density/electric field intensity, which aims to explore the possibility of penta-BN2 sheet as an alternative CO2 capture material. The results show that the CO2 is physisorbed on the neutral penta-BN2 sheet, whereas the interactions between the CO2 and the penta-BN2 surface would be significantly strengthened after introducing appropriate negative charge density/electric field. Interestingly, the CO2 adsorption/desorption processes are spontaneous, reversible and could be effortlessly controlled by introducing/removing extra electrons or external electric field into/from the penta-BN2 nanosheet. The adsorption strength of H2, N2 and CH4 is weaker than that of CO2 on penta-BN2 sheet under the condition of charge/electric field. Namely, the CO2 could be effectively captured and separated from the mixtures of H2, N2 and CH4 with the assistance of negative charge/electric field. These theoretical conclusions could provide a helpful guideline in search of materials with excellent CO2 capture capacity.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "5c2ad3663d1d0f4b7d4c7d9f48c3377cdcab5417", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2129739410", "DOI": "10.1109/CET.2011.6041434", "CorpusId": 44393933}, "title": "Carbon-capture and storage benefits: NOx reduction in O2/CO2 pulverized fuel combustion", "abstract": "Fuel combustion in a mixture of O<inf>2</inf>/CO<inf>2</inf>-recycled is an emerging technology for cost-effective power generation with carbon capture and sequestration that has extra benefits of NO<inf>x</inf> emission reductions and lower flue gas cleanup cost.

All of the greenhouse gases play a role in protecting the earth from rapid loss of heat during the nighttime hours, but abnormally high concentrations of these gases are thought to cause overall warming of the global climate. Governments around the world are now pursuing strategies to halt the rise in concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (Climate Change 2007). Presently it is estimated that more than 30 billion metric tons of CO2 is generated annually by the human activities in the whole world. It is reported that approximately 80 percent of the total which is about 24 billion tons is unfortunately originated from only 20 countries. Table 1 shows a list of the most contributed countries in CO2 emissions. In addition to the efforts for reduction of CO2, a new technology to collect and store CO2 is being aggressively developed. The technology is so called CCS which means Carbon dioxide Capture & Storage. Many scientists have concluded that the observed global climate change is due to the greenhouse gas effect, in which man-made greenhouse gases alter the amount of thermal energy stored in the Earth's atmosphere, thereby increasing atmospheric temperatures. The greenhouse gas produced in the most significant quantities is carbon dioxide. The primary source of man-made CO2 is combustion of fossil fuels. Stabilizing the concentration of atmospheric CO2 will likely require a variety of actions including a reduction in CO2 emissions. Since the Industrial Age, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has risen from about 280 ppm to 377ppm, a 35 percent increase. The concentration of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere is approximately 391 ppm by volume as of 2011 and rose by 2.0 ppm/yr during 2000-2009. Forty years earlier, the rise was only 0.9 ppm/yr, showing not only increasing concentrations, but also a rapid acceleration of concentrations. The increase of concentration from pre-industrial concentrations has again doubled in just the last 31 years.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "0e561ea0b150255a85f2049506b6a56aa86df7c9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2609874562", "CorpusId": 67688290}, "title": "Carbon Capturing Potential of Wood Substitution in Domestic and Office Furniture in India", "abstract": "The changes in temperature have been attributed to increasing concentrations of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other green house gases in the atmosphere and major concerned at present. Greenhouse gases naturally act as a blanket \u201cknown as Greenhouse Effect\u201d of the Earth and facilitate for maintaining about 33 degrees Celsius temperature. Over the past century, the Earth\u201fs temperature has increased by about 0.50 degrees Celsius. The carbon concentration in the atmosphere may be reduced by two approaches. Keeping the atmospheric CO2 concentration below 450\u2013600 ppmv poses an unprecedented challenge to humanity and can be attained by two main approaches: (1) to reduce emissions; (2) to capture CO2 and store it, i.e., through sequestration. Carbon sequestration involves two steps: (1) CO2 capture from the atmosphere (2) storage. The present study deals with the second approach storage. The study concludes that in India the requirement of raw materials such as wood, metal and plastic for furniture annually was 11.6 Mm 3 , 4.46 Mm3, 1.78 Mm3 respectively. Based on the analogy as defined in the methodology, the replacement of 1 M 3 metal or plastic by wood would save 2 tons of carbon dioxide emission. Therefore, this results of the saving of 624000 tonnes CO2 emission against 5% of replacement of each matal and plastic as furniture raw material by wood. This study advocate, use of wood as raw material for furniture, which have a significant potential for mitigating the climate change impacts.", "year": 2014}]}
