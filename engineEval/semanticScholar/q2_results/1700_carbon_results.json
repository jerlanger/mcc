The empirical basis of the study are explorative stakeholder interviews which were conducted with experts from politics, economics, civil society and science and analysed within a discursive and attitudinal framework using qualitative content analysis. These stakeholder positions are assumed to represent dominant social perceptions and reflect chances and risks for acceptance. The results indicate different positions while pursuing the common goal of addressing climate change. The general conflict concerns strategies towards a low-carbon society, especially the speed of phasing-out fossil energies. Regarding the combination of hydrogen and carbon capture and storage as instrument in the context of the energy transition, the stakeholder interviews indicate controversial as well as consensual perceptions. The assessments range from rejection to deeming it absolutely necessary. Controversial argumentations refer to security of supply, competitiveness and environmental protection. In contrast, consensus can be reached by balancing ecological and economic arguments, e.g. by linking hydrogen technologies with renewable and fossil energy sources or by limiting the use of carbon capture and storage only to certain applications (industry, bioenergy).

This paper outlines technology options for phasing out coal emissions in the United States by approximately 2030. We focus on coal for physical and practical reasons and on the U.S. because it is most responsible for accumulated fossil fuel CO(2) in the atmosphere today, specifically targeting electricity production, which is the primary use of coal. While we recognize that coal emissions must be phased out globally, we believe U.S. leadership is essential. A major challenge for reducing U.S. emissions is that coal provides the largest proportion of base load power, i.e., power satisfying minimum electricity demand. Because this demand is relatively constant and coal has a high carbon intensity, utility carbon emissions are largely due to coal. The current U.S. electric grid incorporates little renewable power, most of which is not base load power. However, this can readily be changed within the next 2-3 decades. Eliminating coal emissions also requires improved efficiency, a \"smart grid\", additional energy storage, and advanced nuclear power. Any further coal usage must be accompanied by carbon capture and storage (CCS). We suggest that near-term emphasis should be on efficiency measures and substitution of coal-fired power by renewables and third-generation nuclear plants, since these technologies have been successfully demonstrated at the relevant (commercial) scale. Beyond 2030, these measures can be supplemented by CCS at power plants and, as needed, successfully demonstrated fourth-generation reactors. We conclude that U.S. coal emissions could be phased out by 2030 using existing technologies or ones that could be commercially competitive with coal within about a decade.

The objective of this paper is to assess some low-temperature post-combustion technologies for the capture of CO2 from combustion gases. Two methods for the liquefaction and separation of CO2 are discussed: The use of the low-temperature exergy of liquefied natural gas (LNG), while regasifying the LNG, and a refrigeration cycle with helium as the working fluid. Each of these methods is evaluated at three CO2 concentrations: 30%, 13%, and 4%. The results showed that an increase in the concentration of CO2 in the combustion gases causes a large increase in the overall exergetic efficiency and a large decrease in the cost of CO2 capture and energy penalty of the capture process. In addition, these advantages can be seen when the liquefaction method is changed from helium refrigeration cycle to LNG regasification. For a 30% CO2 concentration using LNG, the overall exergetic efficiency is 41.2%, and the cost of CO2 capture is 45.5 $/tCO2 with a CO2 capture rate of 96.3%.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "e072a00f53d10f831cfbf5740345e1b09e973eb7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3010872964", "DOI": "10.1111/sum.12589", "CorpusId": 216175013}, "title": "Soil and geologic formations as antidotes for CO2 sequestration?", "abstract": "Rapid and far\u2010reaching transitions are required to combat climate change and its impacts.

Despite the many studies that have been performed on clathrate hydrates, the actual molecular mechanism of both their homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation has yet to be fully clarified. Here, by means of molecular simulations, we demonstrate how the interface of hexagonal ice can facilitate the heterogeneous nucleation of methane clathrate hydrate from an aqueous methane solution. Our results indicate an initial accumulation of methane molecules, which promote induction of defective structures, particularly coupled 5-8 ring defects, at the ice surface. Structural fluctuations promoted by these defective motifs assist hydrate cage formation next to the interface.

A variety of engineering studies have been completed that cover these aspects when a plant is operating at full load while operating at a 90 percent capture rate. These studies investigate the basic integration of the these systems, the energy penalty and the effect of capital costs; however, none of these studies comprehensively explore the ability of the capture plant and the balance of the integrated system to respond dynamically to changes in load or capture rate. These load changes occur due to a change in demand for electricity in the system, generation by variable, intermittent resources, or if the plant is equipped with the ability to store solvent to implement price arbitrage. The integrated carbon capture system can be broken down into three general modes: full capacity, load following and peak power generation. Each of these modes presents unique challenges to integration with the CCS system. The load following mode requires the ability to accommodate different ramp rates that are reflected in flue gas flow and composition. Operation at partial load will affect the quality of steam sent to the solvent regeneration unit. Depending on the setup of the steam turbine system, at lower loads multiple extractions points may be necessary or an increase of the amount of extraction steam will be required due to the reduction in steam quality. Using Aspen Dynamics, a CO 2 capture system using a monoethanolamine (MEA) absorption process is simulated at various plant loads to determine the overall effects on the efficiency of the CCS unit and the balance of the system. In addition, the dynamic behavior of the CCS unit on power output and emissions is shown to demonstrate that the capability of a coal-fired power plant to load follow is not hindered by the addition of a carbon capture unit. The solvent storage mode can be further broken to two operation modes. The first is peak power production, which occurs when the solvent is capturing CO 2 from the flue gas, but is minimizing or delaying regeneration to a future time through storage. This mode is used to take advantage of peak power prices by maximizing power output of the plant and maintaining a 90 percent capture rate. The regeneration mode entails the solvent being released from the storage tanks and sent to the reboiler column. Solvent storage has been shown in previous studies to have the ability to increase operating profits, but these studies have neglected to incorporate the capital costs associated with this type of operation mode and the operational issues and complexity associated with the large swings in quantities of steam required for the solvent regeneration. By including the capital costs, this study determines that a system with large duration solvent storage is not economically viable given the flexible demands of the system and current electricity price spreads. This thesis presents a framework for considering the flexible operations of a coal-fired power plant with an integrated carbon capture and sequestration system. By exploring the operational limitations of the integrated system and the economic costs, an evaluation is made of the viability of different CCS operational schemes. This study finds that the CCS unit can match the dynamics of the base coal plant and also increase the operational flexibility of the system. The increased capital expenditure to meet peak demand is viable for larger steam turbine configurations in electricity systems with high peak prices and plants with short duration solvent storage.

The paper asks to what extent and how existing UN, EU, and Swedish climate policy instruments incentivize BECCS research, development, demonstration, and deployment in Sweden. The analysis is followed by a tentative discussion of needs for policy reform to improve the effectiveness of climate policy in delivering BECCS. Drawing on a tripartite typology of policy instruments (economic, regulatory, and informational) and the ability of these instruments to create supply-push or demand-pull, the article finds that: (1) no instruments create a demand-pull to cover operational expenditure; (2) economic instruments provide partial support for research and the capital expenditure associated with demonstration, and; (3) regulatory instruments provide partial clarity on environmental safeguards and responsibilities. A few regulatory barriers also continue to counteract deployment. The article concludes that the existing policy mix requires considerable reform if BECCS is to contribute substantially to the Swedish target for net-zero emissions. Continued effort to dismantle regulatory barriers must be complemented with a strong demand-pull instrument that complements the current focus on supply-push incentives.

The understanding of the responsible microbial processes and their environmental regulation is not only of great scientific interest. It also has substantial economic and social relevance, inasmuch as these processes directly or indirectly affect the quantity and quality of the stored oil or gas. As outlined in the following chapter, in addition to the conventional hydrocarbons, new interest in such deep subsurface systems is rising for different technological developments. These are introduced together with related geomicrobiological topics. The capture and long-termed storage of large amounts of carbon dioxide, carbon capture and storage (CCS), for example, in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, is considered to be an important options to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. On the other hand, the increasing contribution of energy from natural and renewable sources, such as wind, solar, geothermal energy, or biogas production leads to an increasing interest in underground storage of renewable energies. Energy carriers, that is, biogas, methane, or hydrogen, are often produced in a nonconstant manner and renewable energy may be produced at some distance from the place where it is needed.

In CGS, CO2 is captured from large point-source emitters (e.g., coal fired power stations), purified, and injected deep underground into geological formations for disposal. However, the CO2 has a lower density than the resident formation brine and thus migrates upward due to buoyancy forces. To prevent the CO2 from leaking back to the surface, four trapping mechanisms are used: (1) structural trapping (where a tight caprock acts as a seal barrier through which the CO2 cannot percolate), (2) residual trapping (where the CO2 plume is split into many micrometer-sized bubbles, which are immobilized by capillary forces in the pore network of the rock), (3) dissolution trapping (where CO2 dissolves in the formation brine and sinks deep into the reservoir due to a slight increase in brine density), and (4) mineral trapping (where the CO2 introduced into the subsurface chemically reacts with the formation brine or reservoir rock or both to form solid precipitates). The efficiency of these trapping mechanisms and the movement of CO2 through the rock are strongly influenced by the CO2-brine-rock wettability (mainly due to the small capillary-like pores in the rock which form a complex network), and it is thus of key importance to rigorously understand CO2-wettability. In this context, a substantial number of experiments have been conducted from which several conclusions can be drawn: of prime importance is the rock surface chemistry, and hydrophilic surfaces are water-wet while hydrophobic surfaces are CO2-wet. Note that CO2-wet surfaces dramatically reduce CO2 storage capacities. Furthermore, increasing pressure, salinity, or dissolved ion valency increases CO2-wettability, while the effect of temperature is not well understood.

This process reverses the flow of carbon to the atmosphere with the intention of returning the carbon to long-term geologic storage. Models suggest that most of the injected CO2 will be \"trapped\" in the subsurface by physical means, but the most risk-free and permanent form of carbon storage is as carbonate minerals (Ca,Mg,Fe)CO3. The transformation of CO2 to carbonate minerals requires supply of the necessary divalent cations by dissolution of silicate minerals. Available data suggest that rates of transformation are highly uncertain and difficult to predict by standard approaches. Here we show that the chemical kinetic observations and experimental results, when they can be reduced to a single cation-release time scale that describes the fractional rate at which cations are released to solution by mineral dissolution, show sufficiently systematic behavior as a function of pH, fluid flow rate, and time that the rates of mineralization can be estimated with reasonable certainty. The rate of mineralization depends on both the abundance (determined by the reservoir rock mineralogy) and the rate at which cations are released from silicate minerals by dissolution into pore fluid that has been acidified with dissolved CO2. Laboratory-measured rates and field observations give values spanning 8 to 10 orders of magnitude, but when they are evaluated in the context of a reservoir-scale reactive transport simulation, this range becomes much smaller. The reservoir scale simulations provide limits on the applicable conditions under which silicate mineral dissolution and subsequent carbonate mineral precipitation are likely to occur (pH 4.5 to 6, fluid flow velocity less than 5 m/year, and 50-100 years or more after the start of injection). These constraints lead to estimates of 200 to 2000 years for conversion of 60-90% of injected CO2 when the reservoir rock has a sufficient volume fraction of divalent cation-bearing silicate minerals and confirms that when reservoir rock mineralogy is not favorable the fraction of CO2 converted to carbonate minerals is minimal over 104 years. A sufficient amount of reactive minerals is typically about 20% by volume. Our approach may allow for rapid evaluation of mineralization potential of subsurface storage reservoirs and illustrates how reservoir scale modeling can be integrated with other observations to address key issues relating to engineering of geologic systems.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "b8c9c7a55df291040cf4a7eb15219c44394075b2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2775985464", "DOI": "10.1190/1.3377789", "CorpusId": 130100179}, "title": "A comparison of passive seismic monitoring of fracture stimulation from water and CO2 injection", "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is used to create pathways for fluid migrationandtostimulateproduction.Usually,wateristheinjected fluid, although alternative fluids such as carbon dioxide CO2 have been used recently.

Hydraulic fracturing is usually monitored using passive seismic arrays, detecting microseismic events generated by the fracturing. It is of interest to compare the amount of seismicity that CO2 injection can generate in comparison with water. With this in mind, we have analyzed a passive seismic data set monitoring the injection of water and supercritical CO2 under very similar conditions, allowing us to make a direct comparison between the fluids.We examined event locations and event magnitudes, and we used shear-wave splitting to image the fractures that are generated.

One solution is circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion technology combined with a high-efficiency once-through water-steam cycle. Foster Wheeler\u2019s CFB technology is today commercially available up to 800 MWe capacities with ultra-supercritical steam parameters. Simultaneously, the Flexi-Burn CFB technology is being developed to provide capability to flexible operation in air firing and oxy-combustion for carbon capture. CFB technology can offer an attractive solution for the reduction of CO2 emissions as it will provide the advantages like fuel flexibility and low emissions as the air fired CFB technology offers today. Experiments done at pilot test facilities provide information about the CFB performance on oxy-combustion, and the acquired knowledge is being incorporated in boiler modeling and design tools. One of the European R&D initiatives on CCS is the Technological Centre for CO2 Capture and Transport, which is supported by the Spanish Government through the Fundacion Ciudad de la Energia (CIUDEN). CIUDEN is a research and development institution created by the Spanish Administration in 2006 and fully conceived for collaborative research in CO2 capture, transportation and storage. The Technology Development Centre for CO2 Capture comprises two technologies on oxy-combustion: Pulverized Coal (PC) and Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB). This paper will focus on the design and main characteristics of the 30 MWth oxy-CFB boiler. Foster Wheeler is the technology provider of the Flexi-Burn CFB unit, for which commissioning is planned during the second half 2011. The CFB unit design allows either the operation under conventional combustion with air or under oxy-fuel conditions. The size of this experimental boiler is sufficient to allow the scaling of the results to commercial units. In this way, multiple fuels and operating conditions can be tested economically in this experimental unit. The results will validate the design of a future 330 MWe supercritical Oxy-Combustion Power Station (OXY-CFB-300 Compostilla Project) intended to demonstrate the CCS technology in commercial scale. The Compostilla OXY-CFB-300 Project is one of the 6 CCS demonstration projects funded under the European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR) of the EU. The Project is based on a future 330 MWe Circulating Fluidised Bed (CFB) supercritical oxy-combustion plant, with CO2 storage in a deep geological formation. The first phase of the project, granted by the EEPR program and lead by the Spanish utility ENDESA, includes all studies and characterization work needed on the capture, transport and storage as well the costs, financing, regulatory and permitting required, prior to the final investment decision of the plant by the end of 2012 for the construction phase. ** Flexi-Burn is a trademark of Foster Wheeler Energia Oy, registered in the US, EU, Finland.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "52348fc0aaf3e6f2a594420a53bd69f6d823f83a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1974285561", "DOI": "10.2134/jeq2011.0076", "CorpusId": 10613495, "PubMed": "21546663"}, "title": "Agroforestry systems and environmental quality: introduction.", "abstract": "Investments in agroforestry research during the past three decades-albeit modest-have yielded significant gains in understanding the role of trees on farmlands, and the ecological and economic advantages of integrated farming systems. While early research focused mostly on farm or local levels, broader-level ecosystem services of agroforestry systems (AFS) have raised high expectations in recent years. The nine papers included in this special collection deal with three of such environmental benefits of AFS: water-quality enhancement, carbon sequestration, and soil improvement. These benefits are based on the perceived ability of (i) vegetative buffer strips (VBS) to reduce surface transport of agrochemical pollutants, (ii) large volumes of aboveground and belowground biomass of trees to store high amounts of C deeper in the soil profile, and (iii) trees to enhance soil productivity through biological nitrogen fixation, efficient nutrient cycling, and deep capture of nutrients. The papers included have, in general, substantiated these premises and provided new insights. For example, the riparian VBS are reported to increase the reservoir life, in addition to reducing transport of agrochemicals; the variations in C storage in different soil-fraction sizes suggest that microaggregate (250-53 \u03bcm) dynamics in the soil could be a good indicator of its C-storage potential; and the use of vector analysis technique is recommended in AFS to avoid consequences of inaccurate and overuse of fertilizers. The papers also identified significant knowledge gaps in these areas. A common theme across all three environmental quality issues covered is that more and varied research datasets across a broad spectrum of conditions need to be generated and integrated with powerful statistical tools to ensure wide applicability of the results. Furthermore, appropriate management practices that are acceptable to the targeted land users and agroforestry practitioners need to be designed to exploit these environmental benefits. The relative newness of research in environmental quality of AFS will pose some additional challenges as well. These include the lack of allometric equations for tree-biomass determination, absence of standardized norms on soil sampling depth, and limitations of fixed-effect models arising from issues such as pseudo-replication and repeated measures that are common in studies on preexisting field plots. Overall, this special collection is a timely effort in highlighting the promise of AFS in addressing some of the environmental quality issues, and the challenges in realizing that potential.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "1fd229f1cc8b3a82a2f1ba135c21be52ab793f2b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2905055029", "DOI": "10.1016/j.jcis.2018.12.063", "CorpusId": 58569104, "PubMed": "30583204"}, "title": "Magnesium oxide modified nitrogen-doped porous carbon composite as an efficient candidate for high pressure carbon dioxide capture and methane storage.", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "d5227d08c7429964561ef9ee4624e5e5b59812cc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2245187726", "CorpusId": 155373031}, "title": "The Corporatisation of International Responses to Climate Change: The Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute", "abstract": "This article examines the legal and policy implications of the recent establishment of the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute ('Global CCS Institute') which is a new global entity whose primary aim is to accelerate the commercial deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage ('CCS') technology and projects around the world.

The most dominant source of anthropogenic CO2 contributing to the rise in atmospheric concentration since the industrial revolution is the combustion of fossil fuels. These emissions are expected to result in global climate change with potentially severe consequences for ecosystems and mankind. In this context, these emissions should be restrained in order to mitigate climate change. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a technological concept to reduce the atmospheric emissions of CO2 that result from various industrial processes, in particular from the use of fossil fuels (mainly coal and natural gas) in power generation and from combustion and process related emissions in industrial sectors. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) regards CCS as \u201can option in the portfolio of mitigation actions\u201d to combat climate change (IPCC 2005). However, the deployment of CO2 capture at power plants and large industrial sources may influence local and transboundary air pollution, i.e. the emission of key atmospheric emissions such as SO2, NOX, NH3, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC), and Particulate Matter (PM2.5 and PM10). Both positive as negative impacts on overall air quality when applying CCS are being suggested in the literature. The scientific base supporting both viewpoints is rapidly advancing. The potential interaction between CO2 capture and air quality targets is crucial as countries are currently developing GHG mitigation action plans. External and unwanted trade-offs regarding air quality as well as co-benefits when implementing CCS should be known before rolling out this technology on a large scale. The goal of this chapter is to provide an overview of the existing scientific base and provide insights into ongoing and needed scientific endeavours aimed at expanding the science base. The chapter outline is as follows. We first discuss the basics of CO2 capture, transport and storage in section 2. In section 3, we discuss the change in the direct emission profile of key atmospheric pollutants when equipping power plants with CO2 capture.

The results of three experiments with students as participants show that whether or not interest groups receive an opportunity to express their opinions in the decision-making process (i.e., group voice) affects acceptance of CCS policy decisions, with inferred trustworthiness of the decision maker mediating this effect. Decision-making procedures providing different interest groups with equal opportunities to voice their opinions instigate more trust in the decision maker and, in turn, lead to greater willingness to accept decisions compared to no-voice procedures (i.e., unilateral decision-making-Study 1) and unequal group-voice procedures (i.e., when one type of interest group receives voice, but another type of interest group does not-Study 2). Study 3 further shows that an individual's own level of knowledge about CCS moderates the desire for an opportunity for members of the general public to voice opinions in the decision-making process, inferred trustworthiness of decision makers, and policy acceptance. These results imply that people care about voice in decision-making even when they are not directly personally involved in the decision-making process.

Most studies find the potential for 70 to 80 percent reductions in CO2 emissions on a life-cycle basis, depending on the technology. Because of this potential, utilities and policymakers are considering the wide-spread implementation of CCS technology on new and existing coal plants to dramatically curb greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the power generation sector. However, the implementation of CCS systems will have many other social, economic, and environmental impacts beyond curbing GHG emissions that must be considered to achieve sustainable energy generation. For example, emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and particulate matter (PM) are also important environmental concerns for coal-fired power plants. For example, several studies have shown that eutrophication is expected to double and acidification would increase due to increases in NOx emissions for a coal plant with CCS provided by monoethanolamine (MEA) scrubbing. Potential for human health risks is also expected to increase due to increased heavy metals in water from increased coal mining and MEA hazardous waste, although there is currently not enough information to relate this potential to actual realized health impacts. In addition to environmental and human health impacts, supply chain impacts and other social, economic, or strategic impacts will be important to consider. A thorough review of the literature for life-cycle analyses of power generation processes using CCS technology via the MEA absorption process, and other energy generation technologies as applicable, yielded large variability in methods and core metrics. Nonetheless, a few key areas of impact for CCS were developed from the studies that we reviewed. These are: the impact of MEA generation on increased eutrophication and acidification from ammonia emissions and increased toxicity from MEA production and the impact of increased coal use including the increased generation of NOx from combustion and transportation, impacts of increased mining of coal and limestone, and the disposal of toxic fly ash and boiler ash waste streams. Overall, the implementing CCS technology could contribute to a dramatic decrease in global GHG emissions, while most other environmental and human health impact categories increase only slightly on a global scale. However, the impacts on human toxicity and ecotoxicity have not been studied as extensively and could have more severe impacts on a regional or local scale. More research is needed to draw strong conclusions with respect to the specific relative impact of different CCS technologies. Specifically, a more robust data set that disaggregates data in terms of component processes and treats a more comprehensive set of environmental impacts categories from a life-cycle perspective is needed. In addition, the current LCA framework lacks the required temporal and spatial scales to determine the risk of environmental impact from carbon sequestration. Appropriate factors to use when assessing the risk of water acidification (groundwater/oceans/aquifers depending on sequestration site), risk of increased human toxicity impact from large accidental releases from pipeline or wells, and the legal and public policy risk associated with licensing CO2 sequestration sites are also not currently addressed. In addition to identifying potential environmental, social, or risk-related issues that could impede the large-scale deployment of CCS, performing LCA-based studies on energy generation technologies can suggest places to focus our efforts to achieve technically feasible, economically viable, and environmentally conscious energy generation technologies for maximum impact.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "d64f7a2f257f4ff775b3e041fd636375112078a7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2254131862", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-008044704-9/50360-8", "CorpusId": 155375167}, "title": "Carbon dioxide capture and storage: Public perception, policy and regulatory issues in the Netherlands", "abstract": null, "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "fd06c8ee83b29b85a788d0de1eeba4aa4dbc31fd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2593464287", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.6b04515", "CorpusId": 32481758, "PubMed": "28240022"}, "title": "Role of the Freight Sector in Future Climate Change Mitigation Scenarios.", "abstract": "The freight sector's role is examined using the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) for a range of climate change mitigation scenarios and future freight demand assumptions.

Over the 21st century, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from freight are projected to grow faster than passenger transportation or other major end-use sectors, with the magnitude of growth dependent on the assumed extent of long-term decoupling. In climate change mitigation scenarios that apply a price to GHG emissions, mitigation of freight emissions (including the effects of demand elasticity, mode and technology shifting, and fuel substitution) is more limited than for other demand sectors. In such scenarios, shifting to less-emitting transportation modes and technologies is projected to play a relatively small role in reducing freight emissions in GCAM.

The model incorporates power generation as well as CO2 emissions from a fleet of generating stations (hydroelectric, fossil fuel, nuclear, and wind). The model is formulated as a mixed integer program and is used to optimize an existing fleet as well as recommend new additional generating stations, carbon capture and storage, and retrofit actions to meet a CO2 reduction target and electricity demand at a minimum overall cost. The model was applied to the energy supply system operated by Ontario power generation (OPG) for the province of Ontario, Canada. In 2002, OPG operated 79 electricity generating stations; 5 are fueled with coal (with a total of 23 boilers), 1 by natural gas (4 boilers), 3 nuclear, 69 hydroelectric and 1 wind turbine generating a total of 115.8 TWh. No CO2 capture process existed at any OPG power plant; about 36.7 million tonnes of CO2 was emitted in 2002, mainly from fossil fuel power plants. Four electricity demand scenarios were considered over a span of 10 years and for each case the size of new power generation capacity with and without capture was obtained. Six supplemental electricity generating technologies have been allowed for: subcritical pulverized coal-fired (PC), PC with carbon capture (PC+CCS), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), IGCC with carbon capture (IGCC+CCS), natural gas combined cycle (NGCC), and NGCC with carbon capture (NGCC+CCS). The optimization results showed that fuel balancing alone can contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions by only 3% and a slight, 1.6%, reduction in the cost of electricity compared to a calculated base case. It was found that a 20% CO2 reduction at current electricity demand could be achieved by implementing fuel balancing and switching 8 out of 23 coal-fired boilers to natural gas. However, as demand increases, more coal-fired boilers needed to be switched to natural gas as well as the building of new NGCC and NGCC+CCS for replacing the aging coal-fired power plants. To achieve a 40% CO2 reduction at 1.0% demand growth rate, four new plants (2 NGCC, 2 NGCC+CCS) as well as carbon capture processes needed to be built. If greater than 60% CO2 reductions are required, NGCC, NGCC+CCS, and IGCC+CCS power plants needed to be put online in addition to carbon capture processes on coal-fired power plants. The volatility of natural gas prices was found to have a significant impact on the optimal CO2 mitigation strategy and on the cost of electricity generation. Increasing the natural gas prices resulted in early aggressive CO2 mitigation strategies especially at higher growth rate demands. \u00a9 2009 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 2009", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "36504c0dc4ce4eeca8cde648abb2bbd06cac2e30", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2914556635", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-019-02375-z", "CorpusId": 159239437}, "title": "Public support for carbon dioxide removal strategies: the role of tampering with nature perceptions", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) describes a suite of controversial approaches to mitigating climate change that involve removing existing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

Using a moderated mediation analysis, we find that support for different CDR strategies is, in part, a function of how much each strategy is perceived to tamper with nature. Support for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air capture (DAC) was lower than support for afforestation and reforestation (AR), as BECCS and DAC were perceived to tamper with nature more. These effects were particularly strong among individuals generally opposed to the idea of humans interfering with natural processes. Moreover, we find evidence that describing the risks and benefits of each CDR strategy dampens support; for AR and BECCS, this effect was again mediated through perceptions of tampering, while for DAC, the effect of describing these tradeoffs appeared to operate independently of perceived tampering.

Tree species diversity and carbon stocks were positively related, implying a potential functional relationship between the two, and a \u2018win\u2013win\u2019 scenario for conservation; however, lower biomass areas also contain diverse species assemblages meaning that carbon-oriented conservation may miss important areas of biodiversity. Despite these variations, we find that total tree abundance and biomass is skewed towards a few locally dominant species, with eight and nine species (5.7% of the total) accounting for over half the total measured trees and carbon, respectively. This finding implies that carbon production in these areas is channelled through a small number of relatively abundant species. Our results provide key insights into the structure and functioning of these heterogeneous ecosystems and indicate the need for novel strategies for future measurement and monitoring of carbon stocks and biodiversity, including the use for larger plots to capture spatial variations in large tree density and AGC stocks, and to allow the calibration of earth observation data.\n", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "a0aff7e300316b3fd0f2b9f536ca2a0b51a22f51", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2513487355", "DOI": "10.1515/AOTER-2015-0011", "CorpusId": 38615258}, "title": "Technical and economic aspects of oxygen separation for oxy-fuel purposes", "abstract": "Oxy combustion is the most promising technology for carbon dioxide, originated from thermal power plants, capture and storage.

One of the recurring criticisms with the carbonation reactions is their sluggishness, as it is commonly admitted that converting silicates into carbonates within geologic reservoirs may take up to several thousands of years, i.e., a duration which is hardly compatible with the goal of achieving net zero emissions by mid-century. Last year, a study that generated substantial interest suggested that after 2 years, more than 95% of the CO2 injected over the course of a pilot project of CO2 injection in lava flows in Iceland might have been mineralised into carbonates. While such results could have been considered as a green light for industrial applications, a new high-profile study based on the same pilot experiment tempered this idea, as it revealed unexpected modifications of deep ecosystems in response to CO2 injection, evidencing a bloom of chemolithoautotrophic bacteria, which have the ability to promote autotrophic C-fixation. Stated in other words, part of the CO2 that was initially thought to be mineralised under the form of stable carbonates might instead have been converted into (much more labile) biomass. Assessing the respective contributions of carbonates and biomass to the C-sequestration should therefore represent a prerequisite prior to large-scale carbon capture and storage through mineral carbonation, to make sure that the cure is not worse than the disease.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "12b1f86eacf453058c628c72084248ac7c8b99cd", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "4503996", "MAG": "2244158810", "DOI": "10.1038/srep12152", "CorpusId": 7665420, "PubMed": "26179858"}, "title": "The Kallisti Limnes, carbon dioxide-accumulating subsea pools", "abstract": "Natural CO2 releases from shallow marine hydrothermal vents are assumed to mix into the water column, and not accumulate into stratified seafloor pools.

Mineral carbonation (MC) is emerging as a potential CCS technology solution to sequester CO2 from smaller/medium emitters, where geological sequestration is not a viable option. In MC processes, CO2 is chemically reacted with calciumand/or magnesium-containing materials to form stable carbonates. This work investigates the current advancement in the proposed MC technologies and the role they can play in decreasing the overall cost of this CO2 sequestration route. In situ mineral carbonation is a very promising option in terms of resources available and enhanced security, but the technology is still in its infancy and transport and storage costs are still higher than geological storage in sedimentary basins ($17 instead of $8 per tCO2). Ex situ mineral carbonation has been demonstrated on pilot and demonstration scales. However, its application is currently limited by its high costs, which range from $50 to $300 per tCO2 sequestered. Energy use, the reaction rate and material handling are the key factors hindering the success of this technology. The value of the products seems central to render MC economically viable in the same way as conventional CCS seems profitable only when combined with EOR. Large scale projects such as the Skyonic process can help in reducing the knowledge gaps on MC fundamentals and provide accurate costing and data on processes integration and comparison.

Their main purpose is to study the effectiveness of CO2 storage. Russia is one of the world\u2019s largest producers of CO2 emissions. However, CO2 capture and storage issues are not studied by Russian enterprises due to the absence of environmental taxes.
