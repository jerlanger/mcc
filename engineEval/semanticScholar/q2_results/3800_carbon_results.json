In many parts of the world, forest management has shifted from a focus on timber production to multi-purpose forestry, combining timber production with the supply of other forest ecosystem services. However, it is unclear which forest types provide which ecosystem services and to what extent forests primarily managed for timber already supply multiple ecosystem services. Based on a comprehensive dataset collected across 150 forest plots in three regions differing in management intensity and species composition, we develop models to predict the potential supply of 13 ecosystem services. We use those models to assess the level of multifunctionality of managed forests at the national level using national forest inventory data. Results Looking at the potential supply of ecosystem services, we found trade-offs (e.g. between both bark beetle control or dung decomposition and both productivity or soil carbon stocks) as well as synergies (e.g. for temperature regulation, carbon storage and culturally interesting plants) across the 53 most dominant forest types in Germany. No single forest type provided all ecosystem services equally. Some ecosystem services showed comparable levels across forest types (e.g. decomposition or richness of saprotrophs), while others varied strongly, depending on forest structural attributes (e.g. phosphorous availability or cover of edible plants) or tree species composition (e.g. potential nitrification activity). Variability in potential supply of ecosystem services was only to a lesser extent driven by environmental conditions. However, the geographic variation in ecosystem function supply across Germany was closely linked with the distribution of main tree species. Conclusions Our results show that forest multifunctionality is limited to subsets of ecosystem services. The importance of tree species composition highlights that a lack of multifunctionality at the stand level can be compensated by managing forests at the landscape level, when stands of complementary forest types are combined. These results imply that multi-purpose forestry should be based on a variety of forest types requiring coordinated planning across larger spatial scales.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "5558f806a6bb2e1d239f0201e7880a375385c7ec", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 210955197}, "title": "Technology commercialization: Experience of the U.S. and Possibilities for Oil and Gas Industry in Russia", "abstract": "US are leading the way in technology commercialization, while Russia lags far behind.

The glycoluril units of CB[7] are the preferential sites for the adsorption of CO2 gas molecules. The cooperative binding of CO2 molecules inside the cavity of CB[7] has been observed. The geometrical analysis reveals that the carbon atom of CO2 is in close proximity to the nitrogen atom of the glycoluril of CB[7] and the CO2 oxygen atom is in close contact to the carbonyl carbon of the glycoluril unit. The calculated results show that four CO2 and four CH4 molecules can reside inside the CB[7] cavity. However, five N2 gas molecules can be accommodated inside the CB[7] cavity.

Tropical forest ecosystem is believed to comprise a large number of carbon (C) compared to other natural ecosystem where the majority of C stored in the aboveground vegetation. Estimating carbon is a comprehensive approach to mitigate climate change. However, accurate information on aboveground carbon storage is still not enough. Lacking of standard conversion equation of the aboveground biomass (AGB) to carbon estimation in Malaysia contributes to the problem. Difficulties in the methodology plus the high density of plant species has made it tough to be executed. The study has taken place in a tropical lowland forest which is Bubu Forest Reserve (FR). Summarized inventory data were used with a modified equation to estimate total AGB and carbon stock.

First, we look at the use of CCS in scenarios of different Energy-Economy and Integrated Assessment Models. These scenarios look at two climate policy targets and different assumptions regarding the availability of intermittent renewables for power production and the primary bio-energy supply. The results show that, if assumed available, CCS played an important role in the mitigation strategies of all models, although the projected deployment levels vary widely across the models. Cumulative CO2 capture projections during the 21st century range from about 600 to 3050 GtCO2 across all models and investigated scenarios (i.e. 15-80 times current emission levels). Interestingly, models often project increasing amounts of CO2 capture towards the end of this century, which implies that CCS is considered attractive beyond 2100 by many models. In the second chapter, we look at results of a single energy-system simulation model (TIMER) to analyse CCS deployment as a function of uncertainty in techno-economic parameters. For this, we collected a wide range of data from the existing literature regarding the performance and investment cost of power plants and CO2 capture units, transport and storage cost as well as storage capacity estimates. For this uncertainty analysis we run the model for the full uncertainty range of each individual parameter in combination with different fossil fuel price developments. Furthermore, we test the combined uncertainty of plant performance and investment, transport and storage cost on a medium fossil fuel price level. To reflect stringent climate policy all scenarios assumed a carbon price which rises to 165 $2005/tCO2 in 2025 and stays constant over the remaining study horizon (2050). CCS deployment was shown to be strongly dependent on the uncertainty in the cost and performance parameters looked at. The combined uncertainty of the cost and performance parameters resulted in a range of 8-244 GtCO2 captured cumulatively from power production until 2050. The most important individual uncertainty was the investment cost for advanced power plants with and without CCS. The impact of the uncertainty range for CCS storage capacity was found to be small until 2050. However, under pessimistic storage capacity assumptions the impact of this parameter could become more severe when looking at a longer time horizon, as in this scenario analysis a few regions (including China) already used up a large part of their storage capacity until 2050. Subsequently, we looked at the macro-economic impacts of two mitigation strategies with and without CCS for the power sector of Western Europe and The Netherlands. The scenarios without CCS relied more on other low-carbon technologies, including renewables. For both regions, we calculate the difference in impacts on employment, Gross Value Added (GVA) and import dependency between the two strategies using a Multi-Regional Input-Output Model (MRIO). Depending on whether CCS is included or excluded different sectors will increase or decrease production. The differences for employment and GVA could be notable for specific sectors such as construction or sectors providing fuel inputs if these are produced domestically. Results can differ depending on the regional scope and the precise composition of the portfolio including CCS and the alternative scenario. In both the Netherlands and Western Europe import dependency was found to be higher if CCS is part of the mitigation portfolio. The economy wide impacts on GVA and employment need to be investigated further with more dynamic macro-economic models to better understand the impact of lower cost when CCS is included in the mitigation portfolio.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "304358b975a42aa3c059953f2a3ee8921729fbf3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2883843540", "CorpusId": 158924061}, "title": "National and Sectoral GHG Mitigation Potential: A Comparison Across Models", "abstract": "Determining comparability of effort between mitigation actions and targets proposed by different countries is an ongoing issue for international climate negotiations. A number of indicators have been proposed to reflect comparability of effort and differences in national circumstances; key amongst these are greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (per capita), GDP per capita, as well as GHG mitigation potential. This paper focuses on mitigation potential to provide a comparative assessment between six OECD member economies: Australia, Canada, the EU, Japan, Mexico and the US. GHG mitigation potential is defined to be the level of GHG emission reductions that could be realised, relative to the projected emission baseline in a given year, for a given carbon price. Data for the selected countries were obtained across the time horizon of 2005-2050 from a total of 19 models, including models that are used to inform climate policy-makers in each of these economies. The paper examines the implications of model structure, and assesses how baseline scenarios vary between the models, before analysing the GHG mitigation potential estimates. GHG mitigation potential is compared for carbon prices of USD 20, 50 and 100/tCO2e. For an assumed carbon price of USD 50/tCO2e, mitigation potential in Japan is estimated to be relatively lower than for the other five economies, ranging from 5-20% emission reduction from baseline in 2020. Although noticeably fewer models report data for Mexico at this price level, the models show deeper potential reductions in the range of 25-37% at the same carbon price. Mitigation potential estimates for Australia, Canada and the US show a wider range of 14-39% reduction relative to 2020 baselines. The EU shows a relatively tighter range of 16-29% emission reductions to 2020. The results of this study show greater emission reduction potentials in the year 2050 than in the year 2020 across the six economies examined, reflecting structural and technical changes that occur over time, including the availability of carbon capture and storage from 2030. In general, the paper finds closer agreement across the models for mitigation potential in 2020 than for later years, reflecting greater uncertainty as projections extend into the future.

CO2, on estime que ce potentiel est plus faible au Japon que dans les cinq autres economies, ou la reduction des emissions devrait se situer en 2020 entre 5 et 20 % par rapport au scenario de reference. Les modeles fournissant des donnees sur le Mexique -- sensiblement moins nombreux pour ce niveau de prix -- font apparaitre des possibilites de reduction plus importantes, comprises entre 25 et 37 % pour un prix identique du carbone. Les estimations effectuees pour l\u2019Australie, le Canada et les Etats-Unis revelent une fourchette plus large, le potentiel de reduction allant de 14 a 39 % par rapport aux scenarios de reference pour 2020.

Particularly, CO2 injection is the best option due to its superior miscibility effect with oil and in consideration of geological storage of the greenhouse gas. In this study, CO2 injection into a tight oil reservoir for IOR is assessed and a pilot project is underway. The reservoir is located in the G89 Block of Shengli Oilfield East China, which has very poor water injectivity due to very low permeability of less than 5 mD in average, and has been producing via natural depletion since 2005. The original reservoir pressure was over 40 MPa, and the reservoir temperature of 126 . A CO2 injection and storage program has been proposed, and CO2 will be from a coal-fired power plant 30 km away under a Sinopec\u2019s CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) scheme. Laboratory investigation includes PVT experiments, slim tube test and core flooding/displacement experiments, in order to study the miscibility effect and displacement efficiency via CO2 injection at various conditions. Reservoir simulations were performed to predict the IOR potentials of CO2 injection at different pressures, namely at immiscible, miscible and near-miscible modes. The MMP (Minimum Miscibility Pressure) of the reservoir oil is determined as over 29 MPa, while the reservoir pressure at the beginning of CO2 injection was around 23 MPa after several years\u2019 depletion. Therefore, CO2 flooding at a near miscible mode will prevail. A field pilot of CO2 injection at current reservoir conditions (at near-miscible mode) is designed and its performance is presented in the paper. Introduction Injection of CO2 into oil reservoirs may develop different displacement or flooding processes, namely miscible, immiscible and near-miscible, which mainly depend upon the operating pressure, oil and reservoir characteristics. Miscible displacement is the most preferable mechanism for oil recovery with respect to high displacement and sweeping efficiency (Jeschke et al. 2000). However, miscible displacement is only realizable at pressure greater than MMP; therefore miscibility can be difficult to develop in many cases, such as mature oilfields due to the depletion of reservoir energy, and in low permeability reservoirs where a large pressure drop or difference may develop from injector to producer. The miscibility of oil and CO2 is also affected by compositions of crude oil and purity of CO2, rock heterogeneity and gravity segregation (Johns et al. 2002). Compared with miscible flooding, immiscible flooding is less effective, particularly for reservoirs with serious heterogeneity, in which high permeability channels, inverse mobility ratio and viscous \u201cfingering\u201d can lead to early gas breakthrough (Aziz et al. 2009; Zhang et al. 2010). For those reservoirs with relatively low pressure and less favorable for miscibility, a near-miscible process might be developed to maximize the interactions of oil and CO2 and achieve high oil recovery. In recent years, the concept of near-miscible CO2 flooding has been received more and more attention. The research of near-miscibility effect can be tracked back to early 1980s\u2019, when Orr and colleagues (Orr et al. 1981) published their studies on phase behavior of CO2/crude oil mixture, they indicated that the inflexion point in the slim-tube experimental curve may not necessarily signify the transition from immiscible to miscible displacement, instead it can represent a near miscible state because a full miscibility is not achieved, whereas this \u201cnear-miscible\u201d phase behavior can be also good for effective oil displacement. Shyeh-Yung and J-G, J (1991) pointed out that a near-miscible CO2 IOR process has potential to economically recover oil. Hadlow (1992) stated that application of CO2 flooding in reservoirs where a near miscible condition exists can be one of the most significant opportunities for utilization of CO2. Case studies by Thomas et al. (1994) showed that many reservoirs historically designed as miscible flooding would be better described as near miscible.

The kinetics of the carbonation reaction is characterized by several peculiarities, including incomplete conversion, a first fast stage followed by a productlayer diffusion controlled slow stage, an abrupt transition between the two stages, pore reduction and modification of the reactive/pore surfaces. Even though several kinetic models (grain models, random pore models) have been proposed to simulate the carbonation kinetics, the identification of a kinetic model capable to accurately predict the whole conversion vs time curves, particularly at short times, has been a challenging task. In this work a random pore model accounting for a continuous sorbent pore size distribution was developed and applied to the carbonation reaction, including the reaction rate dependence on the equilibrium carbon dioxide partial pressure and the reaction order switch (from zeroth to first order). Such model is predictive once the intrinsic rate constant, the product-layer diffusivity and the initial pore size distribution are known. The simulation results include the conversion versus time curves, as well as the evolution of the pore size distribution and of the pore and reaction surfaces over time, and are compared with experimental data of conversion over time, obtained through a high-pressure thermo-gravimetric analyzer, at a carbon dioxide pressure of 5 bar. The simulation results show that the presented model is capable to predict accurately the whole conversion-time curves, particularly at short times, both in the fast and in the product-layer diffusion regimes, and to represent the abrupt transition due to the pore closure.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "a7b93f20c698ec9c53261ec90cf855e7e4666693", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2060570630", "DOI": "10.1038/NCLIMATE1103", "CorpusId": 85262738}, "title": "Sociology: Learning lessons on carbon storage", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage demonstration projects are focused on learning about technologies through conventional 'learning by doing'.

On the one hand, positivist and relativist scholars agree that the political commitments of the social researcher should not impinge on scientific enquiry, while on the other hand, feminist and Marxist scholars not only take stands in diverse technoscientific debates, but even claim their agendas to be more credible than those of orthodox scientists. Such perspectives stress that all research is partisan in one way or another because it involves questions of who controls, manipulates, and establishes decisions, facts, and knowledge. With this in mind, it is possible to identify different forms of partisan research including capture by participants, de facto and overt partisanship, and mercenary scholarship. These different forms of partisan scholarship are characterised by differences in the motives underlying epistemological choices of research topic and method, personal commitments to the fields studied, use of research findings in controversies, and positioning of results in wider debates. Two examples help to illustrate partisan scholarship: first, a study of new technologies for managing climate change (carbon dioxide capture and storage); and second, the construction of the new underground metro system in Athens and its accommodation of accessibility standards. Both cases entail partisan positions and raise similar concerns about the orthodox epistemological assumptions underpinning sociotechnical systems, especially when it comes to technoscientific controversies.

A steering committee with eighteen scientists from eleven countries was appointed by the EASAC participating academies (Box \u200b(Box1).1). The first workshop concentrated on nuclear energy and explored its possible future scientific and technological developments, while the second workshop addressed renewable energies, energy systems and storage (Table\u00a01).

Whilst energy efficiency was an essential issue throughout the discussions and special consideration was given to the energy efficiency of engines and appliances, particular attention was given to the future of electricity grids, electricity storage and fuel cells. Lastly, concerning energy consumption, there was an important focus on energy for transport. \n \nOne important conclusion from this project is that the energy issue should not be split up into independent contributions: electricity, heat, mechanical work, etc. The transformation to a largely CO2-free energy supply requires that the chemical energy forms are replaced predominantly by electricity. Even more than in the past, an energy policy and development strategy requires keeping in mind the total picture\u2014energy generation, energy transportation and energy usage and each area calls for increased research. Even if a timespan for this transition of more than thirty years does seem long, we nevertheless have to conclude that fossil energy will still be in the energy mix for a long time globally. Therefore, we have to accept the unavoidable need to develop carbon capture and storage techniques, even if Europe could escape to employ this technology. MacElroy (2016) points out clearly the present situation and what research is needed for the future for closing the carbon cycle. Furthermore, the technological development in nuclear energy could alleviate the question of long-term storage of high level nuclear waste. Nuclear fusion research has the chance within the next decade to demonstrate the feasibility of this concept and to demonstrate that a fusion reactor could be an option in the long-term energy mix which is highlighted in the article by Horvath and Rachlew (2016). \n \nWind and solar power have shown a remarkable growth in many countries inside and outside Europe. In countries like Germany, the added installed power level matches peak demand. The efficiency of the solar cells has reached levels where solar cell panels could give considerable contributions to the energy mix in most European countries. Still, new materials might emerge with even better photovoltaic properties. Several basic science research areas within the fields of solar and biofuels are highlighted. The article by Inganas and Sundstrom (2016) highlights the possible development for photovoltaics to enter in a large scale with more efficient, resilient and economic solar panels and takes a look into the research development of the materials needed. The scene of the many functionalities of biofuels is painted by Aro (2016) in her article, which highlights where worldwide research is flourishing. \n \nThe introduction of intermittent electricity sources into the production requires more planning and changes to the distribution net which is modelled and discussed in the paper by Kuhn et al. (2016). In many countries most of the fossile contributions come from the transport sector which would need a transformation to electric vehicles and/or a combination with fuel cells. Both these issues are discussed in the articles by Furfari (2016) and by Niakolas et al. (2016). \n \nSome basic science and major technology research areas have not been included, such as development of chemical and electrical storage systems, and development of new materials (for nuclear reactors, for batteries, for solar panels, for cables), in order to focus this issue more towards the generation of the energy needed for the future. \n \nIn summary, the seven papers included give an overview of fields in energy research which could promise essential progress in low-carbon energy supply and use.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "13678d437e284faa9e5e4af93423fd20064fc8a7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3017098071", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.iecr.9b06177", "CorpusId": 218822801}, "title": "Concentrated Carbon Dioxide (CO2) from Diluted Sources through Continuous Temperature Swing Adsorption (TSA)", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) and most CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) routes require concentrated CO2 streams for efficient compression, pipeline transport, injection or chemica...", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "ca2d6360b067384c3adc65fa34cdef24a15f269c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2508029176", "DOI": "10.3390/EN9090669", "CorpusId": 16554181}, "title": "Comprehensive Exergy Analysis of Three IGCC Power Plant Configurations with CO 2 Capture", "abstract": "We have conducted comprehensive exergy analyses of three integrated gasification combined cycle with carbon capture and storage (IGCC-CCS) power plant configurations: (1) a baseline model using Selexol\u2122 for H 2 S/CO 2 removal; (2) a modified version that adds a H 2 -selective membrane before the Selexol\u2122 acid gas removal system; and (3) a modified baseline version that uses a CO 2 -selective membrane before the Selexol\u2122 acid gas removal system.

Though routes to decarbonizing fossil fuel use, such as carbon capture and storage, have been proposed and have been demonstrated at commercial scale, current CCS CO 2 storage quantities are very small and no large-scale practical route to providing fossil fuel energy, without the CO 2 emissions attendant with fuel production and use has been proposed. Here we look at some of the boundary conditions and possible routes to production of emissions free energy from fossil fuels, and specifically petroleum reservoirs.

(1) In terms of growth, the two industries are at opposite ends of the spectrum: the \"industry\" for capturing, sequestering, and storing C[O.sub.2] is incipient at best, whereas the natural gas industry is fully developed, having gone through almost a century of development, regulation, and restructuring. Natural gas is an integral part of the U.S. economy, accounting for almost a fifth of U.S. power generation, as well as being the major source of energy for residential heating purposes. (2) More impressively, the natural gas industry has an incredible infrastructure: over 420,000 natural gas wells in the United States alone (3) produce 18.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas (4) that is transported through 285,000 miles of pipeline to its various users. (5) The United States also imports some 16% of its natural gas, nearly all of it from Canada via pipeline. (6) Somewhat ironically, it is the combustion of natural gas, along with all other fossil fuels, that has given rise to the infant industry of C[O.sub.2] capture and storage (CCS). CCS represents a major tool in the effort to reduce anthropogenic C[O.sub.2] emissions into the atmosphere, especially for the United States, which relies on fossil fuels for over 85% of its energy needs. (7) And while CCS is only one of a portfolio of measures being considered by policymakers, (8) because it can be used for any large point source of C[O.sub.2], ranging from coal-fired power plants (9) to cement production or the iron and steel industry, (10) CCS is '\"the critical enabling technology\" that can significantly reduce C[O.sub.2] emissions while still allowing the United States to rely on coal and other fossil fuels in the near future. (11) This is particularly salient for coal, given that the United States possesses the largest recoverable coal reserves on the planet. (12) Thus CCS presents what may be the most feasible and broadly applicable method for reducing C[O.sub.2] outputs that the United States currently possesses in the short- to medium-term. Many authors and institutions have focused on analyzing CCS because nearly all of the industry's pieces currently exist or are technologically feasible; all that is left is for someone to put them together. (13) It is at this point, however, that difficult questions arise: what will the CCS \"industry\" look like? Who will own the C[O.sub.2]? How will it be economically feasible? And how will the industry be regulated? While the natural gas industry is not the only analog to CCS, (14) a close examination of the industry and its lessons for CCS has yet to occur. This paper seeks to do exactly that: Part I contains a detailed case study of the natural gas industry and its past and present regulation; Part II gives a brief description of the CCS industry's various moving parts; Part III draws lessons from the case study to the CCS industry; and Part V offers some conclusions. I. THE NATURAL GAS INDUSTRY A. Present Industry Structure The natural gas industry is made up of a fairly straightforward structure, starting with natural gas production and processing. Though the discovery and processing of natural gas are deeply involved processes, they are outside the scope of the present analysis. (15) Thus the relevant analysis of the natural gas industry begins once the gas has been discovered, processed, pressurized, and ready for transport. 1. Pipelines Pipelines transfer natural gas from the major production and processing regions of the United States to the major consumption areas. (16) Figure 1 demonstrates this principle as well as the extent of the natural gas pipeline infrastructure. Pipeline costs vary widely: factors such as the area's congestion, terrain (e. \u2026", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "760ab272b92716cb87215b1df7cea2d44074838d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2430235802", "DOI": "10.3303/CET0918150", "CorpusId": 114972867}, "title": "Pathways to a sustainable European pulp and paper industry: Trade-offs between different technologies and system solutions for kraft pulp mills", "abstract": "Earlier studies have shown that for chemical pulp mills there are many technologies and system solutions which can increase energy efficiency and thus reduce the process energy demand and consequently also the global emissions of CO2. Which technology pathway (combination of technologies and system solutions) holds the greatest potential for future profits and reduction of global CO2 emissions depends both on mill-specific conditions and on the surrounding energy system through e.g. policy instruments and energy market prices. In this paper the trade-off, in terms of system revenue and global CO2 emission consequences, between different technology pathways for utilization of excess heat at chemical kraft pulp mills is investigated for a case depicting a typical Scandinavian mill of today. The trade-off is analysed for four future energy market scenarios having different levels of CO2 charge. The technology pathways included in this study are (1) increased electricity production in new condensing turbines, (2) production of district heating, (3) increased sales of biomass in the form of bark and/or lignin, and (4) carbon capture and storage (CCS). Lignin extraction and CCS are considered as new and emerging pathways and the other pathways are considered to be well-tried. The results show that well-tried pathways such as increased electricity production in new turbines, selling bark and district heating production are economically robust, i.e. they are profitable for all of the studied energy market scenarios. The new and emerging technology pathways such as carbon capture and storage and lignin extraction hold a larger potential for reduction of global CO2 emissions, but their economic profitability is more dependent on the development of the energy market. All in all, it can be concluded that to realize the larger potential of reduction of global CO2 emissions a high carbon cost alone may not be sufficient. Other economic stimulations are required, e.g. technology-specific subsidies.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "2a3d0c869ebf9b401c49d12ad994995f2e423340", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fclim.2021.705032", "CorpusId": 238639488}, "title": "Potential for Negative Emissions by Carbon Capture and Storage From a Novel Electric Plasma Calcination Process for Pulp and Paper Mills", "abstract": "The pulp and paper industry has a high potential to contribute to negative emissions through carbon capture and storage (CCS) applied to existing processes. However, there is a need to investigate how CCS solutions also can be combined with implementation of other emerging technologies in pulp and paper mills. This paper investigates the integration of a novel calcination process in two kraft mills and evaluates its potential combination with capture and storage of CO2 from the calcination plant. The alternative calcination process uses electric gas-plasma technology combined with steam slaking and allows replacing the conventional fuel-driven lime kilns with a process driven by electricity. The novel calcination process generates a pure, biogenic, CO2 stream, which provides an opportunity to achieve negative emissions at relatively lower costs. The potential reduction of greenhouse gas emissions when replacing the lime kiln with the plasma calcination concept depends strongly on the emissions intensity of grid electricity, and on whether fossil fuel or biomass was used as a fuel in the lime kiln. If fossil fuel is replaced and electricity is associated with very low emissions, avoided CO2 emissions reach ~50 kt/a for the smaller mill investigated in the paper (ca 400 kt pulp per year) and almost 100 kt/a for the larger mill (ca 700 kt pulp per year). Further emission reductions could then be achieved through CCS from the electrified calcination process, with capture potentials for the two mills of 95 and 164 kt/a, respectively, and capture and storage costs estimated to 36\u201360 EUR/tCO2.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "533a8d763c058de4278742d7510ad56600e5c341", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3198119188", "DOI": "10.3390/atmos12091111", "CorpusId": 239652808}, "title": "Health Risk and Environmental Assessment of Cement Production in Nigeria", "abstract": "The cement manufacturing industry has played a fundamental role in global economic development, but its production is a major facilitator to anthropogenic CO2 release and solid waste generation.

The Ministry for Mines and Steel Development asserts that the nation possesses total limestone deposits of around 2.3 trillion MT with 568 MMT standing as established reserves and 11 MMT used. Cement industries are largely responsible for releasing air pollutants and effluents into water bodies with apparent water quality deterioration over the years. Air pollution from lime and cement-producing plants is seen as a severe instigator of occupational health hazards and work-related life threats, negatively affecting crop yields, buildings, and persons residing in the vicinity of these industries. World Bank observed in 2015 that 94% of the Nigerian populace is susceptible to air pollutants that surpass WHO guidelines. In 2017, World Bank further reported that 49,100 premature deaths emanated from atmospheric PM2.5, with children beneath age 5 having the greatest vulnerability owing to lower respiratory infections, thereby representing approximately 60% of overall PM2.5-induced deaths.

Biotic introductions have occurred concurrently with climate change, altering the seed bank and propagule pressure from surroundings. Designing seed mixes with high diversity will increase the likelihood that species will be present that respond favorably to changes. Second, more research is needed on persistence as a long\u2010term measure of stability. What is perhaps most important to restoration is how persistent restorations are on decade to century scales, and restorations are now of sufficient quantity and age to test questions about persistence. Third, the importance of stochastic processes due to priority effects has been supported by recent studies and have challenged the deterministic assembly model. Target species establishment could be improved by changing the order of introduction of species. Finally, grasslands provide many ecosystem services to society, including nutrient capture, food production, carbon storage, tourism and recreation, and nectar and pollen production. Grasslands are important culturally as outdoor science laboratories. For these reasons, I suggest that grasslands provide an excellent model system for restoration ecology.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "b8b7f987daa59744473dd2e527336f71514c1199", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3017378367", "DOI": "10.18178/ijscer.8.2.126-132", "CorpusId": 218473345}, "title": "Sustainable Concrete: A Review", "abstract": "The demand for cement and concrete is highly increasing due to urbanization and increase in the world\u2019s population.

Using supplementary cementitious materials as partial replacement of cement, is one of the main opportunities to reduce the amount of cement usage in concrete. The paper also reviews other factors that can increase sustainability of cement and concrete industry, which include utilizing recycled aggregates and other recycled materials, optimize concrete mix design, structural optimization, replacement of fossil fuels, carbon capture and storage, increasing durability of concrete, extending the service life of existing infrastructures, water management, implementing regulations as well as other opportunities such as carbonation, alternative binders, energy storage and energy harvesting. These solutions can play an important role in producing more sustainable concrete and thus, reducing GHG emissions, conserving natural resources, decreasing wastes and conserving energy. \uf020", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "01c516c1e14605b1fdea626bc53396ec3259bd43", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2272678113", "CorpusId": 22441272}, "title": "Soil Co2 Efflux and Soil Carbon Content as Influenced by Thinning in Loblolly Pine Plantations on the Piedmont of Virginia", "abstract": "The thinning of loblolly pine plantations has a great potential to influence the fluxes and storage of carbon within managed stands. This study looked at the effects of thinning on aboveground carbon and mineral soil carbon storage, 14-years after the thinning of an 8-year-old loblolly pine plantation on the piedmont of Virginia. The study also examined soil respiration for one year following the second thinning of the same stand at age twenty-two. The study was conducted using three replicate .222 hectare stands planted using 3.05 by 3.05 meter spacing in 1980 at the Reynolds Homestead in Critz, VA. Using two different sample collection methods it was determined that soil carbon was evenly dispersed throughout thinned plots, and that random sampling techniques were adequate for capturing spatial variability. Soil carbon showed a significant negative correlation with soil depth (p=0.0001), and by testing the difference between intercepts in this relationship, it was determined that thinning significantly increased soil carbon by 31.9% across all depths (p=0.0004). However, after accounting for losses in aboveground wood production, thinning resulted in an overall 10% loss in stand carbon storage. However, this analysis did not take into account the fate of wood products following removal. Soil respiration, soil temperature, and soil moisture were measured every month for one year near randomly selected stumps and trees. In order to account for spatial variation, split plots were measured at positions adjacent to stumps and 1.5 meters away from stumps. Soil temperature and moisture were both significantly affected by thinning. Regression analysis was performed to determine significant drivers in soil CO2 efflux. Temperature proved to be the most significant driver of soil respiration, with a positive correlation in thinned and unthinned stands. When modeled using regression, thinning was a significant variable for predicting soil respiration (p < 0.0009), but explained only 3.4% of the variation. The effects of thinning were responsible for decreased respiration, however, when coupled with increased temperatures, soil respiration was elevated in thinned stands.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "e64a324c6e43b2e488b96960e5e574303e7df739", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2883043439", "DOI": "10.1088/978-0-7503-1581-4", "CorpusId": 139830358}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "7efd27c7869af8baf0b5d0db873d6f62f80def7b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "74427025", "CorpusId": 127794617}, "title": "Quantifying the Impact of Proposed Carbon Emission Reductions on the U.S. Energy Infrastructure", "abstract": "The U.S. is actively considering the adoption of ambitious targets for greenhouse gas emissions that would require a reduction in energy-related carbon dioxide releases of 80% or more by the year 2050. Achieving such a goal will entail a rapid transition away from reliance on petroleum for transportation and high carbon fuels for electricity generation towards alternative transportation fuels and low-carbon electrical generating technologies, including solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Even with adoption rates for these technologies that are all near or even beyond the limits of plausibility, it will be impossible to achieve the desired emission reductions while simultaneously maintaining reasonable economic growth unless, in addition, the energy efficiency of the economy improves at a rate significantly above the historical trend. If that trend were to persist, however, and in addition nuclear and coal with CCS were both removed from the supply mix, the desired emission reductions could be achieved only if per capita economic output were to decline, even with an installed base of solar and wind capacity many times greater than the current level. Lester and Finan, \u201cThe Impact of Carbon Emission Reduction Targets\u201d July 2009 2 Introduction This paper examines the implications for the U.S. energy infrastructure of the targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions now being actively considered by the U.S. government. The Waxman-Markey legislation recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives calls for U.S. carbon emissions to decline 83% from their level in 2005 by 2050. At various times President Obama has similarly called for emission reductions of over 80% by mid-century, and in July the President agreed with the other G8 leaders that the developed countries, including the U.S., should reduce their emissions 80% by 2050. These targets are loosely derived from integrated scientific and economic assessments of the consequences for the earth\u2019s climate of elevated atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. The problem of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions will affect all countries. Here we examine what would be required for the U.S. to achieve reductions in this general range. It is widely recognized that an effective strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions must focus on the energy sector, whose releases of carbon dioxide account for 80% of all U.S. anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. There are two essential elements of a strategy for reducing energy-related carbon emissions: first, improving the efficiency of energy use (energy productivity) or, equivalently, reducing the \u2018energy intensity\u2019 of the economy; and second, \u2018decarbonizing\u2019 the nation\u2019s energy supply infrastructure \u2013 that is, reducing the carbon intensity of the energy system by moving away from primary reliance on petroleum for transportation and high carbon fuels for electricity generation towards alternative transportation fuels and low or zero-carbon electrical generating technologies. It is evident that these two elements of an overall strategy are interdependent. The more rapid the transition to low carbon energy supplies, the less we will need to rely on energy end-use efficiency gains to achieve a given emission reduction target, and vice versa. There is in fact a fixed relationship between the two if a target for economic output is specified together with the carbon reduction goal. The relationship between these four factors \u2013 carbon 1 H.R. 2454: American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, Section 702 2 Climate change avoidance strategies must also reduce emissions of potent non-carbon greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide.

Linking separate emissions trading schemes together can further drive down the costs of abating pollution by creating a wider market, but there are a number of issues\u2014political, technical, and environmental\u2014which can either prevent a link from being established or can cause a link to have harmful effects. This paper examines how easily a U.S. emissions trading scheme, designed along the lines of recent legislative proposals with input from industry leaders, environmental advocates, and the Obama administration, could be linked to the largest existing emissions trading scheme, the European Union\u2019s Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). This paper concludes that very little or no harmonization is required on a number of issues, such as cost containment, allocation methodology, coverage and non-compliance penalties, and that the thornier issues of cap and price levels and offset use can either be resolved or do not present insurmountable hurdles given the potential benefits of establishing a link. The political economy of linking, in terms of the domestic pressures affecting governments seeking a link, is examined and, while a complex set of incentives face both the U.S. and the EU, it appears that overall a link is not merely possible but likely within a decade of the creation of a U.S. system. However, this paper strongly urges that the issues raised are considered by policymakers when crafting a U.S. ETS in order to facilitate linking in the long run. \uf02a James Chapman is currently working in the London office of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP.

Hydrogen is the intermediary between primary energy sources and end products in many chemical processes such as ammonia generation, refining, and biogas processing, and is currently mainly produced by reforming of natural gas. Hydrogen from electrolysis can both make a strong environmental impact on these industries and also improve utilization of intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind and solar by leveraging otherwise stranded resources. Hydrogen can also enable improved integration of the electrical grid with the transportation sector and industrial processes, by serving as a storage medium until needed (Figure 1). Because of hydrogen's end use flexibility, electrolysis is a key component of Europe's strategy for energy storage and management of these renewable energy sources on the electrical grid. Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis is especially well suited to energy capture because of the dynamic range and ability to quickly ramp up and down from near zero output to full capacity. PEM electrolysis was largely developed in the 70's by GE for life support applications where reliability and reproducibility were key. As the technology was translated to commercial markets it started to compete with the incumbent alkaline water electrolysis on cost, safety (no mixing of O2 and H2), ease of maintenance (no caustic) and operational flexibility (differential pressure operation, idling). While the resulting commercial success of PEM electrolysis suggests that the current state of the technology is sufficiently mature, the truth is that while PEM electrolyzers have demonstrated > 50,000 hrs lifetimes and > 99% reliability in the field, the technology and manufacturing techniques have not changed significantly from those early days. In traditional industrial applications the customer rarely cares about efficiency as much as reliability. At the same time, the robustness and manufacturability of the technology (cell, stack and system engineering), have allowed the systems to be scaled from laboratory scale (0.01kg/day) to megawatt scale (100kg/day) with no loss in performance or reliability. To date the research community has mostly focused on advancing PEM fuel cell technology, producing staggering PGM reduction, improvement in efficiency and translation to high throughput manufacturing. Thus electrolysis technology development has lagged behind PEM fuel cells, providing significant opportunities for continued improvements. Thinner membranes, reduced PGM usage, and improved manufacturing techniques have all demonstrated viability for electrolysis, and have the potential to make higher cost and performance impact. As the application areas for PEM electrolysis start to shift from traditional markets to fueling and renewable energy capture, efficiency, capital cost and ethical resource use become significant factors. Thus advancing the state of the art, translating laboratory advances to commercial PEM stacks and then manufacturing them at scale, while maintaining reliability becomes paramount. Questions that arise are: How do you test reliability, without testing for 50,000 hrs? How do you pick research \"winners\" at the rotating disk electrode (RDE) level and develop them to large scale PEM membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs). Where is the gap in research at the laboratory scale based on commercial failures? This talk will discuss the challenges in continued scale up, translating laboratory scale findings to commercial systems as well as some of recent advancements and impact on cost.

In the meantime, several studies have evaluated regional strategies for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation. Although these studies propose scenarios that meet the climate policy pledges, most of them are based on measures that have not been commercially demonstrated yet, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS). The aim of this work is to develop a low-carbon scenario for the energy sector in Sao Paulo, Brazil (whose emissions are significant at the regional and national level) until 2050 and to verify if a proven, technology-based approach meets the current policy goals. Although the analysis is based on a developing country, Sao Paulo state is the most developed region in Brazil. Consequently, the analysis presented in this work may be replicated in other regional settings, with distinct development stages, which demand increasing energy futures. In the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, energy demand increases 2.6% per year until 2050, and emissions consequently increase 2.8% per year, reaching 235 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (tCO2). If four alternatives proposed in the low-carbon (LC) scenario were implemented, 28% of the BAU emissions would be avoided. However, even with this LC scenario, Sao Paulo would not meet the state pledge, remaining 44% above the policy emission cap. This result means that more audacious measures are needed to achieve an effective result. Such measures must push the current technical, scientific, and industrial knowledge and may require a biodiesel share over 20% in diesel blend, extensive increases in renewable energy supply, CCS, and bioenergy associated with CCS.

Northern peatlands can be subdivided into bogs and fens based on their hydrology and biogeochemistry. Peatland hydrology and biogeochemistry are tightly coupled to climate and, therefore, may be very sensitive to climate variability and change. To address the fate of the large peatland soil C storage under a future changed climate, a peatland C model, the McGill Wetland Model (MWM), was coupled to a land surface climate model (the wetland version of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme, CLASS3W), referred as CLASS3W-MWM. We evaluated the CLASS3W-MWM for a bog (Mer Bleue, located at 45.41\u00b0N, 75.48\u00b0W, in eastern Canada) and a poor fen (Deger\u00f6 Stormyr, located at 64\u00b011\u2032N, 19\u00b033\u2032E, in northern Sweden). CLASS3W-MWM captured the magnitude and direction of the present day C cycling very well for both bogs and fens. Moreover, the seasonal and interannual variability were reproduced reasonably well. Root mean square errors (RMSE) were <0.65 and the degree of agreements (d*) were >0.8 for the components of net ecosystem production (NEP) for both the Mer Bleue bog and the Deger\u00f6 Stormyr fen. The performance of the coupled model for both bog and fen is similar to that of the stand-alone MWM driven by observed weather rather than simulated surface and soil climate. This modelling study suggests that northern peatlands are hydrologically and thermally conservative ecosystems. It was also shown that C cycling for bogs and fens was more sensitive to changes in air temperature than precipitation. Changes in temperature within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected range switch the peatlands from a present-day C sink to a source, but projected changes in precipitation still maintain the peatlands as a C sink, although to a somewhat lesser degree. Increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration enhances C sequestration for both bogs and fens. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that northern peatlands respond to changes in temperature, precipitation and doubled CO2 concentration in a highly non-linear way. The sensitivity of C cycling in northern peatlands with respect to changes in air temperature, precipitation and the concentration of atmospheric CO2 together is not a simple addition or subtraction of the sensitivity of the individual changes. Therefore, the sensitivity of a combination of changes in temperature, precipitation and doubled CO2 concentration is very different from the sensitivity of peatlands to each environmental variable on their own. Our sensitivity analysis suggests that fens have a narrower tolerance to climate changes than bogs.

Thus, the critical points and near-critical region of CO2 flow were numerically analyzed.

The large volume of carbon dioxide (CO2) needed to be sequestered along with its relatively benign health effects present a sharp contrast to the limited volumes and hazardous nature of high-level radioactive waste (RW). There is well documented capacity in North America for 100 years or more of sequestration of CO2 from coal-fired power plants. Aside from economics, the challenges of GCS include lack of fully established legal and regulatory framework for ownership of injected CO2, the need for an expanded pipeline infrastructure, and public acceptance of the technology. As for RW, the USA had proposed the unsaturated tuffs of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, as the region\u2019s first high-level RWD site before removing it from consideration in early 2009. The Canadian RW programme is currently evolving with options that range from geologic disposal to both decentralized and centralized permanent storage in surface facilities. Both the USA and Canada have established legal and regulatory frameworks for RWD. The most challenging technical issue for RWD is the need to predict repository performance on extremely long timescales (104\u2013106 years). While attitudes toward nuclear power are rapidly changing as fossil fuel costs soar and changes in climate occur, public perception remains the most serious challenge to opening RW repositories. Because of the many significant differences between RWD and GCS, there is little that can be shared between them from regulatory, legal, transportation or economic perspectives.

The approach to calculation of the resource (available pore space) for carbon dioxide storage shares much in common with the process used to estimate oil, gas, or indeed aquifer water volume. The calculation involves the following stages: measurement of gross rock volume, calculation of net (porous) rock volume, calculation of void space, and finally determination of how much of the void space could be filled with carbon dioxide. The accuracy with which the first three calculations can be made is determined by the quantity and quality of the data available. Typically, gross rock volume is not measured directly but instead combines geographic location data with time domain information from seismic reflection surveys then subject to interpretation of the horizons of interest. Net to gross and porosity tend to be measured very accurately for individual wells or parts of wells but as formation architecture is both heterogeneous and anisotropic, further uncertainties are introduced in the upscaling process from single or multiple wells to field (storage site). However, the most difficult step in the calculation is the final one; what proportion of the void space can be occupied by CO2? Theoretically, the whole of the pore space could be occupied by CO2, but in practice, it will not be possible to remove all of the water or petroleum from a system used for carbon storage.

To achieve that full potential will require use of CO2 from combustion and gasification systems, such as fossil fuel power plants, where capture of CO2 is more costly.

However, the adaptability of energy-storage and return feet to uneven ground and the effects on biomechanical and clinical parameters have not been investigated in detail. Objectives: To investigate the design-related ability of prosthetic feet to adapt to cross slopes and derive a theoretical model. Study design: Mechanical testing and characterization. Methods: Mechanical adaptation to cross slopes was investigated for six prosthetic feet measured by a motion capture system. A theoretical model linking the measured data with adaptations is proposed. Results: The type and degree of adaptation depends on the foot design, for example, stiffness, split toe or continuous carbon forefoot, and additional ankle joint. The model used shows high correlations with the measured data for all feet. Conclusions: The ability of prosthetic feet to adapt to uneven ground is design-dependent. The split-toe feet adapted better to cross slopes than those with continuous carbon forefeet. Joints enhance this further by allowing for additional inversion and eversion. The influence on biomechanical and clinical parameters should be assessed in future studies.

Globally, effects in total cost often average out, but different regions are affected quite differently from the underlying uncertainty in costs for key abatement technologies. Regions can be either affected because they are well suited to deploy a technology for geophysical reasons or because of repercussions through international energy markets. The absolute impact of uncertainty on consumption increases over the time horizon and with the ambition of emission reductions. Uncertainty in abatement costs relative to expected abatement costs are however larger under a moderate ambition climate policy scenario because in this case the marginal abatement occurs in the electricity sector where the cost uncertainty is implemented.

Elemental capture spectroscopy logs were analyzed to investigate possible correlations between adsorption capacity and mineralogy. The maturity of the shale was characterized using average random vitrinite reflectance data yielding values ranging from 0.78 to 1.59 (upper oil to wet gas and condensate hydrocarbon maturity values). Total organic carbon (TOC) content ranges from 0.69 to 14%. Calculated CO2 adsorption capacities at 2.75 MPa range from a low of 0.4 m3/t (14.1 ft3/t) to more than 4.2 m3/t (148.3 ft3/t). A direct linear correlation between measured TOC and the adsorption capacity of the shale has been determined; CO2 adsorption capacity increases with increasing TOC. Data also suggest that CO2 is preferentially adsorbed (5.3:1) and would displace CH4, leading to a potential method for enhancing natural gas recovery in gas shales. Initial estimates of the volume of CO2 sequesterable in the shale based on these data indicate a capacity of as much as 25 billion t in the deeper and thicker parts of the Devonian shales across Kentucky.

Synergies exist between high technology used in the space sector and in the characterization of underground environments such as repositories, because of common objectives with respect to instrument miniaturization, low power requirements, durability under extreme conditions (in temperature and mechanical loads) and operation in remote or otherwise difficult to access environments.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "b2b1ac8cb12ac8ee02de38eeafeb168ef3446bd1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2739742147", "CorpusId": 116009086}, "title": "Does Carbon Capture and Storage Lock People into Fossil Fuel Use? \u2013 A Cradle to Grave Analysis", "abstract": "Existing studies on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) only focus on costs and carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction that arise at the power plant and geological storage.

I show that the true costs vary between 60 and 90 US-Dollars per ton of CO2. Since it is not evident whether CCS is an efficient mitigation option, it is compared to a variety of renewable energy sources. On average, it is cheaper to avoid one ton of CO2 by means of wind energy, but costs arising from the use of solar energy are higher.

Biochar can potentially deplete atmospheric carbon (C) levels and enhance C sequestration to combat climate change. Lower mineralization and higher recalcitrance of biochar enhance the C sequestration and reduce the release of CO2. Biochar application to the soil reduces N2O and CH4 emissions and increase microbial growth and activities. The recalcitrance and C sequestration potential of different biochars were investigated by using recalcitrance index (R50), H/C and O/C molar ratios, and proximate analyses in this chapter. Biochar+silica composite pyrolyzed at 600 \u00b0C (BC+S600), ball-milled biochar+silica composite pyrolyzed at 600 \u00b0C (MBC+S600), and eggshell+biochar composite pyrolyzed at 600 \u00b0C (EP-BC600) were highly recalcitrant, exhibiting R50 values above 0.7. Interestingly, BC+S600 and MBC+S600 exhibited the highest values of C sequestration potentials as well (95.59% and 21.17%, respectively). However, pyrolysis temperature, feedstock type, soil characteristics, and biochar application rates affect the efficiency of biochar for GHG mitigation, its recalcitrance, and C sequestration potential. Thus, the efficiency of biochar for C sequestration can be enhanced with advanced smokeless biomass pyrolytic techniques for safe energy production and climate change mitigation.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "9462529939ca433e62d6dbd57931586eafec0370", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2900418514", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.201802996", "CorpusId": 187574300}, "title": "Lessons Learned From Development Of The First Norwegian CSS Project", "abstract": "Gassnova is working to establish what could become Europe's first industrial CCS project.
