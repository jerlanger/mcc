Timber structures act as carbon storages and timber construction is sometimes claimed as a solution to mitigate climate change. This article attempts to estimate (a) the volume of carbon stored in wooden structures of new buildings annually, and (b) the role of new wooden buildings as a compensator of human-caused annual CO2 emissions in Finland and globally. Annual share from the total CO2 emissions stored in wooden buildings is called building sink effect (BSE). The BSE was 0.61 in Finland in 2017, and global BSE is even smaller. In order to achieve a global BSE of 1%, approximately 450 million m3 of wood products, corresponding to 85% of the global production of lumber, all structural engineered wood and construction logs, should be long-term stored in buildings. New wooden buildings have almost indistinguishable mitigative influence on annual CO2 emissions. However, timber construction is an important factor in a strategy towards more climate smart future, and substitution effects multiply the effects of physical carbon storages. Still more powerful actions, such as emission cuts or reforestation, have to be implemented to see real climate effects.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "43ed83e8a7b06585e33ac2fc3e6df8a0471dea63", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3185918069", "DOI": "10.1016/J.APENERGY.2021.117418", "CorpusId": 237661676}, "title": "Hubs and clusters approach to unlock the development of carbon capture and storage \u2013 Case study in Spain", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "b06cc80995a094418d2769e48f40feac548f8530", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2997082360", "DOI": "10.1029/2019JG005430", "CorpusId": 212985024}, "title": "High Seasonal Variability in Sediment Carbon Stocks of Cold\u2010Temperate Seagrass Meadows", "abstract": "Seagrass meadows have a high ability to capture and store atmospheric CO2 in the plant biomass and underlying sediment and thereby function as efficient carbon sinks. The seagrass Zostera marina is a common species in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, a region with strong seasonal variations in climate. How seasonality affects carbon storage capacity in seagrass meadows is largely unknown, and therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess variations in sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) content over a 1\u2010year cycle in seagrass meadows on the Swedish west coast. The TOC was measured in two Z. marina sites, one wave exposed and one sheltered, and at two depths (1.5 and 4 m) within each site, every second month from August 2015 to June 2016. We found a strong seasonal variation in carbon density, with a peak in early summer (June), and that the TOC was negatively correlated to the net community production of the meadows, presumably related to organic matter degradation. There was seasonal variation in TOC content at all sediment sections, indicating that the carbon content down to 30 cm is unstable on a seasonal scale and therefore likely not a long\u2010term carbon sink. The yearly mean carbon stocks were substantially higher in the sheltered meadow (3,965 and 3,465 g m\u22122) compared to the exposed one (2,712 and 1,054 g m\u22122) with similar seasonal variation.

A full fuel cycle analysis is used to compare the energy use and carbon (C) emissions of different fuel and vehicle strategies. Fuel and vehicle costs are presented as well as cost-effectiveness estimates. Lowest hydrogen fuel costs are achieved using fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage. The fuel supply cost for a H2 fuel cell car would be close to those for an advanced gasoline car, once a large-scale supply system has been established. Biomass, wind, nuclear and solar sources are estimated to be considerably more expensive. However fuel cells cost much more than combustion engines. When vehicle costs are considered, climate policy incentives are probably insufficient to achieve a switch to H2. The carbon dioxide (CO2) mitigation cost would amount to several hundred US$ per ton of CO2. Energy security goals and the eventual need to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations could be sufficient.

The predictability of the continuity of the reservoir and confining units can be improved by applying principles of sequence stratigraphy, including integration of lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, paleoenvironmental proxies, and a novel application of fluvial aggradation cycles (FACs). We evaluate the storage and confinement potential for the Lower Cretaceous Waste Gate Formation and mid-Cretaceous Potomac Formation/Group in New Jersey and Maryland, which we divide into three major reservoirs (Waste Gate-Potomac Unit I, Potomac Unit II, and Potomac Unit III). We use new core data to ground-truth well-logs and paleoenvironmental changes, sequence stratigraphic stacking patterns (including FACs), and pollen biostratigraphy to update previous well-log correlations in New Jersey and extend these correlations into deep holes in Maryland. While individual sand beds are typically local in extent, zones of sands are broadly correlative over distances of 60 km. These regionally traceable sand-prone zones should be useful for carbon storage. Cenomanian Potomac Unit III sands are relatively thick (\u223c 70 m) in New Jersey, but generally thin (average of \u223c 50 m) into Maryland; they are near the updip limit for supercritical storage (800 m) in New Jersey and Maryland and may not be suitable due to updip migration above the supercritical level.

The authors highlight recent optimizations of cell components as well as systems-level architecture. Science, this issue p. eaba6118 BACKGROUND Alleviating the worst effects of climate change requires drastic modification of our energy system: moving from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy sources. The challenge is not the amount of renewable energy available\u2014energy potential from solar and wind exceeds global energy consumption many times over. Rather, the key to a 100% renewable energy supply lies in the integration of the growing share of intermittent sources into a power infrastructure that can meet continuous demand. The higher the share of renewables, the more flexible and interconnected the energy system (the electric grid, the gas and heat networks, etc.) needs to be. Critically, a future energy system where the supply of electricity, heat, and fuels is based solely on renewables relies heavily on technologies capable of converting electricity into chemicals and fuels suitable for heavy transport at high efficiencies. In addition, higher electrolysis efficiency and integrated fuel production can decrease the reliance on bioenergy further than conventional electrolysis can. ADVANCES Electrolysis is the core technology of power-to-X (PtX) solutions, where X can be hydrogen, syngas, or synthetic fuels. When electrolysis is combined with renewable electricity, the production of fuels and chemicals can be decoupled from fossil resources, paving the way for an energy system based on 100% renewable energy. Solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) technology is attractive because of unrivaled conversion efficiencies\u2014a result of favorable thermodynamics and kinetics at higher operating temperatures. SOECs can be used for direct electrochemical conversion of steam (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), or both into hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO), or syngas (H2+CO), respectively. SOECs can be thermally integrated with a range of chemical syntheses, enabling recycling of captured CO2 and H2O into synthetic natural gas or gasoline, methanol, or ammonia, resulting in further efficiency improvements compared with low-temperature electrolysis technologies. SOEC technology has undergone tremendous development and improvements over the past 10 to 15 years. The initial electrochemical performance of state-of-the-art SOEC single cells has more than doubled, while long-term durability has been improved by a factor of \u223c100. Similar improvements in performance and durability have been achieved on the stack level. Furthermore, SOEC technology is based on scalable production methods and abundant raw materials such as nickel, zirconia, and steel, not precious metals. Performance and durability improvements as well as increased scale-up efforts have led to a hundredfold gas production capacity increase within the past decade and to commissioning of the first industrially relevant SOEC plants. Over the next 2 to 3 years, plant size is expected to further increase by a factor of almost 20. In recent years, SOEC systems have been integrated with downstream synthesis processes: examples include a demonstration plant for upgrading of biogas to pipeline quality methane and the use of syngas from an SOEC plant to produce fuels for transport via the Fischer-Tropsch process. OUTLOOK Improved understanding of the nanoscale processes occurring in SOECs will continue to result in performance and lifetime gains on the cell, stack, and system levels, which in turn will enable even larger and more efficient SOEC plants. In Germany, the share of intermittent renewables in the electricity supply has passed 30%, while in Denmark, intermittent sources account for almost 50% of the electricity supply. As this happens for a growing number of countries, demand for efficient energy conversion technologies such as SOECs is poised to increase. The increasing scale will help bring down production costs, thereby making SOECs cost-competitive with other electrolysis technologies and, given sufficiently high CO2 emissions taxation, cost-competitive with fossil-based methods for producing H2 and CO. SOECs offer an opportunity to decrease the costs of future renewable energy systems through more efficient conversion and enable further integration of renewables into the energy mix. Solid oxide electrolyzers: From nanoscale to macroscale. The splitting of H2O or CO2 occurs at solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC) electrodes. Multiple cells are combined into SOEC stacks, which are in turn combined into SOEC plants. When renewable electricity is used, the production of transport fuels and chemicals can be decoupled from fossil resources. SOECs operate at elevated temperatures, resulting in electrolysis efficiencies unattainable by other electrolysis technologies. In a world powered by intermittent renewable energy, electrolyzers will play a central role in converting electrical energy into chemical energy, thereby decoupling the production of transport fuels and chemicals from today\u2019s fossil resources and decreasing the reliance on bioenergy. Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOECs) offer two major advantages over alternative electrolysis technologies. First, their high operating temperatures result in favorable thermodynamics and reaction kinetics, enabling unrivaled conversion efficiencies. Second, SOECs can be thermally integrated with downstream chemical syntheses, such as the production of methanol, dimethyl ether, synthetic fuels, or ammonia. SOEC technology has witnessed tremendous improvements during the past 10 to 15 years and is approaching maturity, driven by advances at the cell, stack, and system levels.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "2070c0ebfc61a3cb49fcb95b1d530cfe82f4a906", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2955327072", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-030-15868-2_1", "CorpusId": 198412762}, "title": "Large Scale Utilization of Carbon Dioxide: From Its Reaction with Energy Rich Chemicals to (Co)-processing with Water to Afford Energy Rich Products.

It is near the coastal economic zone of Guangdong province where a large number of CO2 emission sources are located. Carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery (EOR) represents an opportunity to promote offshore carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) deployment because CO2 flooding offers a method to recover additional oil while simultaneously sequestering anthropogenic CO2. In this paper, a comprehensive multiparameter \u2018quick look\u2019 and potential evaluation method was proposed to screen and assess offshore CO2 EOR potential. A screening scheme for the CO2 EOR potential of reservoirs of the PRMB was also proposed using additional parameters, including reservoir properties and engineering design incorporating a dimensionless screen model and calculations. The results show that the suitability of reservoirs for CO2 EOR and storage varies and could be categorized into four priority grades. Approximately 30 of the oil reservoirs from 10 oilfields were preferentially identified by applying the screening method for reservoirs with predicted higher ultimate recovery potentials. It was predicted that 3227\u00d7 10t of additional oil could be produced from these reservoirs and that 3617\u00d710t of CO2 could be simultaneously stored. The sensitivity analysis shows that injection pressure (Pinj) would be more sensitive than production pressure (Pp) and well distance (L) on the CO2 EOR and storage efficiency, indicating that EOR operations with higher Pinj may improve oil production.

The results of this study showed that calcite formation is associated with the partial destruction of Ca silicates, and that carbonation was proportional to reaction time. The calculated capture efficiency was proportional to the reaction time, whereas carbonation did not seem to significantly depend on particle size in the studied conditions.

The research consisted of four steps over a time period of 1.5 year, from early 2011 to mid-2012. The first step consisted of four related qualitative and quantitative research activities to provide a social characterization of the areas: desk research, stakeholder interviews, media analyses, and a survey among representative samples of the local community. The aim was to identify: stakeholders or interested parties; factors that may drive their perceptions of and attitudes towards CCS. Results were used to as input for the second step, in which a new format for public engagement named \u2018focus conferences\u2019 was tested at both sites involving a small sample of the local community.

The survey was largely identical to the survey in step 1 to enable the monitoring of changes in awareness, knowledge and opinions over time.Results provide insight in the way local CCS plans may be perceived by the local stakeholders, how this can be reliably assessed at early stage without raising unnecessary concerns, and how results of this inventory can be used to develop effective local communication and participation strategies.

Duyar The accumulation of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere due to industrialization is being held responsible for climate change with increasing certainty by the scientific community. In order to prevent its further accumulation, CO2 must be captured for storage or conversion to useful products. Current materials and processes for CO2 capture rely on the toxic and corrosive methylethanolamine (MEA) absorbents and are energy intensive due to the large amount of heat that needs to be supplied to release CO2 from these absorbents. CO2 storage technologies suffer from a lack of infrastructure for transporting CO2 from many point sources to the storage sites as well as the need to monitor CO2 against the risk of leakage in most cases. Conversion of CO2 to useful products can offer a way of recycling carbon within the industries that produce it, thus creating processes approaching carbon neutrality. This is particularly useful for mitigation of emissions if CO2 is converted to fuels, which are the major sources of emissions through combustion. This thesis aims to address the issues related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) by coupling a CO2 conversion process with a CO2 capture process to design a system that has a more favorable energy balance than existing technologies. This thesis presents a feasibility study of dual function materials (DFM), which capture CO2 from an emission source and at the same temperature (320C) in the same reactor convert it to synthetic natural gas (SNG), requiring no additional heat input. The conversion of CO2 to SNG is accomplished by supplying hydrogen, which in a real application will be supplied from excess renewable energy (solar and/or wind). The DFM consists of Ru as methanation catalyst and nano dispersed CaO as CO2 adsorbent, both supported on a porous \u03b3-Al2O3 carrier. A spillover process drives CO2 from the sorbent to the Ru sites where methanation occurs using stored H2 from excess renewable power. This approach utilizes flue gas sensible heat and eliminates the current energy intensive and corrosive capture (amine solutions) and storage processes without having to transport captured CO2 or add external heat. The catalytic component (Ru/\u03b3-Al2O3) has been investigated in terms of its suitability for a DFM process. Process conditions for methanation have been optimized. It has been observed that the equilibrium product distribution for CO2 methanation with a H2:CO2 ratio of 4:1 can be attained at a temperature of 280C with a space velocity of 4720 h. TGA-DSC has been employed to observe the sequential adsorption and reaction of CO2 and H2 over Ru/\u03b3-Al2O3. It was shown that H2 only reacts with a CO2-saturated Ru/\u03b3-Al2O3 surface but does not adsorb on the bare Ru surface at 260C, consistent with an Eley-Rideal type reaction. In this rate model CO2 adsorbs strongly on the catalyst surface and reacts with gas phase H2. Kinetic tests were employed to confirm this observation and demonstrated that the rate dependence on CO2 and H2 was also consistent with an Eley-Rideal mechanism. A rate expression according to the EleyRideal model at 230C was developed. Activation energy, pre-exponential factor and reaction orders with respect to CO2, H2, and products CH4, and H2O were determined in order to develop an empirical rate equation in a range of commercial significance. Methane was the only hydrocarbon product observed during CO2 hydrogenation. The activation energy was found to be 66.084 kJ/g-mole CH4. The empirical reaction order for H2 was 0.88 and for CO2 0.34.

However, large-scale inversion requires high, often prohibitive, computational costs associated with a number of large-scale coupled numerical simulation runs and large dense matrix multiplications. As a result, traditional inversion techniques have limited utility for problems that require fine discretization of large domains and a large number of measurements to capture small-scale heterogeneity, like $$\\text {CO}_2$$CO2 monitoring in the subsurface.

Transient pressure and heat tracer measurements from multiple dipole pumping tests are simulated with the TOUGH2 simulator and are used to estimate the heterogeneous permeability field and the corresponding uncertainty. For this scenario, we investigate the worth of combining heat and pumping tracer data for characterization.

The rates of carbon accumulation in above-ground and below-ground biomass were estimated to be 11.85 t C/ha/yr and 11.71 t C/ha/yr, respectively.

Specifically, for a solvent consisting of 1,3-dimethylimidazolium cations and formate anions, evolution of hydrogen (H(2)) and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) was observed within a few picoseconds when BO-MD trajectories were carried out at an elevated temperature of 3000 K. The observed dehydrogenation involved a reaction between a formic acid solute and a nearby solvent formate anion. The observed mechanism contrasts with the unimolecular mechanism proposed in the gas phase. Specifically, in the ionic liquid, the reaction is initiated from a C-H bond dissociation of a formate anion to produce a short-lived hydride anion, which subsequently captures the acidic proton of a nearby formic acid molecule. The present BO-MD computations suggest that the high reducing ability of formic acid in the ionic liquid is due in part to its acid-dissociated form: the formate anion, which is encouraged to dissociate into a hydride anion and CO(2) by the strong electrostatic field of the ionic liquid solvent.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "cf45be814a0e774ad9c762fe594174d42a15158c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "115063246", "CorpusId": 107538756}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage: bury the myth and focus on alternatives", "abstract": "In theory, carbon capture and storage (CCS) mitigates the effects of climate change by pumping carbon dioxide underground.

This is because fossil fuel energy is now and will be in the foreseeable future the major energy in Guangdong. CCS may have other benefits such as helping energy security and bring new business opportunities. The feasibility of CCS development in Guangdong is ensured by the existence of sufficient CO2 storage capacity in offshore sedimentary basins in the northern South China Sea. A safe CO2 storage is achievable as long as the selection of storage sites and the storage operations are in restrict quality control. The increased cost and energy penalty associated with CCS could be reduced through technical R&D, the utilization of captured CO2, and the utilization of infrastructure of offshore depleted oil fields.

Fossil fuel-based power plants accounted for approximately 40% of all CO2 emissions from the United States in 2008 and therefore represent an important factor to address atmospheric CO2 emissions. Once captured, CO2 storage in geologic formations represents a potential scale-appropriate solution. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs, un-mineable coal seams, and deep (>2,500 feet) saline formations are being explored as targets for large scale geologic storage of CO2. Of these, deep saline formations may represent the largest potential sink. The national-scale version of the Water, Energy and Carbon Sequestration Simulation Model (WECSsim \u00a9 ) presents the engineering and cost uncertainties involved with scaling up CO2 capture and storage (CCS) at the national level while accounting for the substantial uncertainty with specific geological parameters. This paper presents the ranges of costs for CCS due to variations in plant type, capture technology, and geological storage formation uncertainties. Several national-level CO2 storage supply curves were developed to illustrate how sensitive both storage costs and storage volumes are to engineering, economic and geologic performance assumptions. Initial results indicate the avoided cost of CO2 for the U.S. range from 82 to 136 $/tonne for 1 gigatonne (Gt) of CO2. These costs correspond to cumulative annual emissions reductions of 1.5 to 0.6 Gt of CO2 per year at $100 / tonne.

Land availability for biomass cultivation, processing, and conversion is quantified based on a land-use analysis, avoiding all competition with land used for food production, human habitation, and other protected areas. We find that secondary biomass sources provide a valuable supplement to primary biomass, augmenting indigenous biomass supplies. In initial phases of deployment, we observe that infrastructure is initially clustered near cities, and other sources of low cost, secondary biomass, but as CDR targets are increased and indigenous secondary biomass supplies are exhausted, infrastructure begins to move closer to potential biomass planting areas with higher yield. In minimising the cost of CDR on a cost per tonne CO2 removed basis, we find that the availability of secondary biomass, land availability, and yield are key factors that drive the cost of CDR. Importantly biomass conversion efficiency of a BECCS plant has an inverse effect on CDR costs, with less efficient plants resulting in lower costs compared to their more efficient counterparts.

Samples activated by KOH exhibited better adsorption characteristics (such as higher values of SBET, Vtotal, Vmicro, etc.) than those activated by ZnCl2.

Among them coal will increase its share because of its vast reserves, its relatively even global distribution and its low prices compared to oil and gas. On the other hand the burning of coal emits larger quantities of CO2 than oil and gas. As CO2 is the leading cause for global warming, the use of coal for power generation demands a clean coal technology with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Therefore in this work it is suggested to combine a coal gasification unit with a Graz Cycle power plant, an oxy-fuel technology of highest efficiency. The firing of the syngas from coal gasification with pure oxygen avoids the expensive pre-combustion CO2 sequestration and leads to a working fluid of CO2 and steam, where CO2 is captured by simple steam condensation. In contrast to this, the more conventional technology is to send the syngas to a water-shift reactor and a CO2 scrubber so that a fuel containing mainly hydrogen is obtained which can be fired in a conventional combined cycle plant. In order to evaluate these two competing technologies a thermodynamic simulation as well as an economic cost analysis of both power cycles is performed. It turns out that the achievable efficiency of the Graz Cycle plant is \u2014 despite of the increased oxygen demand \u2014 far higher than that of a plant of conventional capture technology due to the avoidance of shift reaction and scrubbing.

The potential of CCS in the industrial sectors is considered to be significant to mitigate CO2 emission to the atmosphere. IEA has estimated that, in a scenario to halve global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2050 compared to 2007 level, nearly half of all CCS deployed (up to more than 10Gt/yr) would be in industrial processes. In the study, the environmental performance of CCS deployment in blast furnace (BF), top gas recycling blast furnace (TGRBF) and COREX processes which are technologies for producing pig iron has been evaluated by Hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA). In terms of BF with a capture unit of chemical absorption by MEA solvent, expect for the GWP, other environmental impacts showed increases. As for TGRBF with PSA (pressure swing adsorption), while GWP and TAP decreased compared to TGRBF without CCS, the other environmental impacts were increased. COREX with physical absorption by Selexol solvent showed same trend with the BF+MEA. The net reduction of GWP was 26% in the BF+MEA, 31% in the TGRBF+PSA, and 48% in the COREX+Selexol when performing CCS technologies into pig iron production in life cycle boundary.

Large scale centralized power plants have been the main research focus of CCS, but the potential of CCS in the industry and petroleum refineries is also significant. Moreover, a large transition from centralized power generation to distributed generation (DG) may be seen in the future. If stringent CO2 emissions reduction is needed, DG systems will have to consider options that enable large CO2 emissions reduction, such as CCS. In this context, this thesis investigates the technical and economic performance of CO2 capture in industries and distributed energy systems for the short-mid term future (ST/MT) and the long term future (LT). The techno-economic assessment and comparison of CO2 capture technologies was performed for iron and steel, cement, and refineries and petrochemical sectors. The assessment is based on an extensive literature review, covering studies from both industries and academia. Key parameters, e.g. capacity factor, energy prices, interest rate, economic plant lifetime, CO2 compression pressure, and grid electricity CO2 intensity, were standardized to enable a fairer comparison of technologies. In the iron and steel sector, the results indicate that a cost of 40-65\u20ac/tCO2 avoided at a CO2 avoidance rate of 0.7-0.8tCO2/t hot rolled coil (40-45% of the total carbon input to the plant) are possible in the ST/MT. In the LT, advanced add-on capture technologies may not offer significant economic advantages over conventional ones. Instead, advanced steelmaking technologies will incorporate CO2 capture as part of production efficiency improvement while achieving significantly lower steel production costs compared to existing technologies. In the cement sector, 65-70\u20ac/tCO2 avoided at a CO2 avoidance rate of 0.6tCO2/t clinker (60% of onsite emissions) are possible in the ST/MT. In the LT, the costs may be reduced to 25-55 \u20ac/tCO2 avoided, but the CO2 avoidance rate may be somewhat lower. For petroleum refineries and petrochemical sectors, 50-60\u20ac/tCO2 avoided at CO2 avoidance rate of about 80% can be achieved in the ST/MT. In the LT, advanced oxyfuel CO2 capture with an integrated power plant may enable 30\u20ac/tCO2 avoided or lower. Regarding CO2 capture in distributed energy systems, the energy efficiency reduction due to CO2 capture (energy penalty) in the ST/MT vary significantly by fuel type, energy system type and its application, ranging from 11% to 33%. CO2 avoidance costs are around 40-140\u20ac/tonne for systems larger than 100 MWLHV (fuel input) and 50-160 \u20ac/tonne for 10-100MWLHV. In the LT, the CO2 capture energy penalty may be reduced to around 4-9%. CO2 avoidance costs are around 10-90 \u20ac/tonne for systems larger than 100MWLHV, 25-100\u20ac/tonne for 10-100MWLHV and 35-150\u20ac/tonne for 10MWLHV or smaller. CO2 compression and distributed transport costs may become a bottleneck mainly at smaller scales (more than 50\u20ac/tCO2 transported for systems with 1MWLHV natural gas input or smaller). The results indicate that any industrial and distributed CO2 emission sources should be included for the consideration of CCS both in the short and the long term, but the technical and economic feasibility is more case-dependent than in the centralized power sector.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "7b27b4a2fc437f9edbcbd5d4537f750fd843bb1e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "198311172", "CorpusId": 108204338}, "title": "Life Cycle Assessment of Power Generation Technologies with CO2 Capture", "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage has large a potential to mitigating the CO2 emissions caused by fossil fuel powered power plants. CCS reduces the energy efficiency of the plant and increases the demand on chemicals and infrastructure. It is though not only the direct emissions from the power plants that have an impact on the environment. The entire supply chain of the power plant has an impact, and it is therefore necessary to evaluate the entire life cycle of the plant. This thesis consists of a full process LCA of post-combustion absorption based carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies for both coal power plants and natural gas power plants. The assessed CCS technologies are based on the solvents MEA, MDEA and chilled ammonia. MEA is the most commonly used solvent in post-combustion capture, while MDEA and chilled ammonia represents novel CCS technologies that are still under development. It was shown that a 90% capture rate was possible for all of the assessed capture technologies. It was further shown that the total global warming potential (GWP) could be decreased with above 60%. 90% reduction is not possible because of indirect emissions in the supply chain. The reduction in GWP comes at a cost of decreasing energy efficiency, which further leads to an increase in consumption of materials and infrastructure. This causes the non-GHG related impacts to increase, compared to a base scenario without CCS. CCS technology based on MDEA was calculated to be the technology with the lowest impact, mainly because it has the lowest energy requirement. Chilled ammonia was assessed as the technology with the largest impacts. The reason for this is that the chilling process is very energy intensive and therefore decreases the efficiency more, compared to the other technologies assessed.

To this end, a novel PSA-based warm gas CO2-removal technology is compared to a state-of-the-art integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power plant with dual-stage Selexol unit for carbon capture using computational methods. The carbon capture in the Selexol case is limited to 83.40 % due to the high methane content in the syngas. The Selexol efficiency is 31.11 %-HHV resulting in a cost-of-electricity (COE) of 148.6 $/MWh with transport, storage, and monitoring (TSaM). Integration of the warm gas CO2-removal technology increases the efficiency to 34.20 %-HHV. Optimization of the water gas shift reactors using thermodynamic gas stability analysis and kinetic reaction modeling results in an efficiency of 35.63 % leading to a reduction in COE to 127.2 $/MWh with TSaM. With the here introduced Ro number, the catalyst volume of isothermal shifting can be reduced by up to 73 %. Due to a higher capture yield of the PSA-technology, carbon capture of 88.6 % can be achieved. In order to reach the U.S. Department of Energy target of 90 % carbon capture, three options are addressed: (1) combustion of syngas in the CO2 purification section while raising steam, (2) syngas reforming in an external adiabatic reformer and (3) syngas recycling to the gasifier.

Among these measures, the use of biomass, which is considered one of the most cost-effective renewables and, in addition, carbon neutral, combined with CO 2 capture and storage will play an important role toward reducing the fossil-based CO 2 emissions.

The addition of an amine capture system to both the coal-fired and biomass cofiring plants further reduces the efficiency of the plants by more than 10% points. Analyzing the effect of various CO 2 capture process parameters on the heat, solvent and cooling water requirements, and on the overall plant performance, it was found that the concentration of amine in the solution is the most important parameter. The results showed that the net electrical efficiency increases for systems using higher amine concentrations.

This fraction is expected to depend on the time since injection, the location of injection, and the future atmospheric concentration of CO2. We approximate the evasion of injected CO2 at specific locations using a nonlinear convolution model including explicitly the nonlinear response of CO2 solubility to future CO2 concentration and alkalinity and Green's functions for the transport of CO2 from injection locations to the ocean surface as well as alkalinity response to seafloor CaCO3 dissolution. Green's functions are calculated from the results of a three-dimensional model for ocean carbon cycle for impulses of CO2 either released to the atmosphere or injected a locations deep in the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. CO2 transport in the three-dimensional (3-D) model is governed by offline tracer transport in the ocean interior, exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere, and dissolution of ocean sediments. The convolution model is found to accurately approximate results of the 3-D model in test cases including both deep-ocean injection and sediment dissolution.

Experiments were carried out on a laboratory-scale stainless steel plate and leak signals were obtained from a circular hole in the center of this flat-surface structure. In order to reduce the influence of the ambient noise and dispersion of the acoustic wave on the localization accuracy, ensemble empirical mode decomposition is deployed to extract the useful leak signal. The time differences between the signals from the adjacent sensors in the array are calculated through correlation signal processing before estimating the corresponding distance differences between the sensors. A hyperbolic positioning algorithm is used to identify the location of the circular leak hole. Results show that the circular sensor array has very good directivity toward the circular leak hole.

The main objective of the work in the Low Carbon Finland 2050 platform project was to identify cost-effective and robust pathways for moving into a low carbon economy by 2050, by creating a set of different scenarios for the future society and economy. The report outlines the work carried out with the VTT TIMES model, which is a global partial equilibrium techno-economic energy systems model. On the global level, the analysis considers also the energy system impacts on the depletion of known mineral resources for critical high-tech metals, many of which are closely associated with the key energy technologies of the future. The work builds on the prior work of Koljonen and Simil\u00e4 (2013), but presents a further elaboration of the different storylines and pathways to a low carbon economy. In the different pathways not only the technology portfolios are changed but also the structure of the whole economy, including substantial changes in the Finnish energy intensive industries, community structures, and even consumer behaviour. The sensitivities to uncertainties in the energy system\u2019s development with respect to key technologies and energy sources are also assessed with the help of the TIMES model. Such key sensitivity parameters include agreements on global climate policies, the viability and potential role of carbon capture and storage, sustainability of biomass resources, and the future of nuclear power in Europe. Taking into account these uncertainties, the low carbon pathways are characterised with respect to their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. Achieving the targets for a low carbon economy is technically feasible under many different technology pathways. However, the results clearly indicate that the transition can occur most smoothly and with lowest impacts on the economies when a reasonably high diversity in the energy supply system is maintained. That would imply also the need for employing CCS, both within the energy sector and energy intensive process industries. Bioenergy remains the most important renewable energy source in all scenarios. The analysis indicates that a very high reliance on non-biomass renewables would require rapid technological development with a break-through in energy storage technology, and would entail considerable uncertainties with respect to both economy and technology.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "4a8e57df5e01bef0061fdd4093b32cfebd7170b1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2578990943", "CorpusId": 157390769}, "title": "Targeting for Minimum Low and Zero-carbon Energy Resources in Carbon-constrained Energy Sector Planning Using Cascade Analysis", "abstract": "This work presents targeting techniques for energy sector planning with carbon (CO2) emission constraints.

The chemical phenomena are modelled on the basis of a simplified approach, which assumes that pollutant conversion is governed by oxygen storage and release dynamics. The transport phenomena, i.e. heat transfer, gas-phase mass transfer, washcoat diffusion, and pressure drop, are modelled on the basis of correlations adapted from the literature. The model is validated using lambda scan tests and a cold-start driving cycle, carried out with a honeycomb catalyst and a ceramic foam catalyst. The experimental data show a decline in methane conversion for lean mixtures, which is modelled by an inhibition term of methane oxidation from nitric oxide. The proposed model may capture the performance of both substrates with sufficient accuracy, both under cold-start and under hot-mode conditions. The model-based comparison of the two substrates shows that the ceramic foam presents inferior carbon monoxide conversion in the extra-urban part of the cycle. Although the gas-phase mass transfer in the ceramic foam is faster than with the honeycomb monolith, diffusion in the washcoat pores is much slower. As a result, the mass-transfer-limited conversion efficiency of the foam is lower. This is primarily attributed to the higher washcoat thickness of the foam sample tested.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "ee4a7fa930eddbb06c835b258bf2624d08b70adc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2878747342", "DOI": "10.17226/25170", "CorpusId": 134419118}, "title": "Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage Approaches for Carbon Dioxide Removal and Reliable Sequestration", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "792fd777ceb666035e50dc7ad6a0b92ca334dbaf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2595136362", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.201601555", "CorpusId": 131881561}, "title": "Quantitative Prediction of Injected CO2 at Sleipner Using Wave-equation Based AVO", "abstract": "Summary In the context of carbon capture and storage (CCS), quantitative estimation of injected CO2 is of vital importance to verify if the process occurs without any leakage. From a geophysical perspective this is challenging as a CO2 plume has a severe imprint on seismic data.

In this abstract a wave-equation based AVO technique is discussed and successfully demonstrated on a seismic dataset from the Sleipner site. The technique solves the exact wave-equation which means that tuning effects are properly modelled.

A site suitable for commercial-scale storage was characterised, compatible with current and future industrial carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) sources in the northern UK. Pre-characterisation of the site, based on existing information acquired during hydrocarbon exploration and production, has been achieved from publicly available data. The project concept is to store captured CO 2 at a rate of 5 Mt per year for 20 years in the Blake Oil Field and surrounding Captain Sandstone saline aquifer. This commercial-scale storage of 100 Mt CO 2 can be achieved through a storage scenario combining injection of CO 2 into the oil field and concurrent water production down-dip of the field. There would be no encroachment of supercritical phase CO 2 for more than two kilometres beyond the field boundary and no adverse influence on operating hydrocarbon fields provided there is pressure management. Components of a storage permit application for the site are presented, developed as far as possible within a research project. Characterisation and technical investigations were guided by an initial assessment of perceived risks to the prospective site and a need to provide the information required for the storage permit application. The emphasis throughout was to reduce risks and uncertainty on the subsurface containment of stored CO 2 , particularly with respect to site technical performance, monitoring and regulatory issues, and effects on other resources. The results of selected risk assessment-led site characterisation investigations and the subsequent risk reassessments are described together with their implications for the understanding of the site. Additional investigations are identified that could further reduce risks and uncertainties, and enable progress toward a full storage permit application.

It seems that C-S-H generated by the pozzolanic...", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "b140754f4594cc37fe276f921c761f28feae7a85", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2581895262", "DOI": "10.3390/SU9020168", "CorpusId": 17713755}, "title": "New Coal-Fired Plants Jeopardise Paris Agreement", "abstract": "Global greenhouse gas emissions need to peak soon and be reduced practically to zero in the second half of this century in order to not exceed the climate targets adopted in the Paris Agreement. However, there are currently numerous coal-fired power stations around the world at different stages of construction and planning that could be completed in the next decade. If all these plants are actually built, their expected future emissions will make it very difficult to reach these targets, even in an optimistic scenario with the deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies. Policy makers around the world need to react quickly and help to redirect investment plans for new coal-fired power stations towards low-carbon technologies.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "860154ee89d2f711e0a50fd096c2a1d7114282ce", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3134852566", "DOI": "10.1007/s10450-021-00306-y", "CorpusId": 232083644}, "title": "Adsorption for efficient low carbon hydrogen production: part 1\u2014adsorption equilibrium and breakthrough studies for H2/CO2/CH4 on zeolite 13X", "abstract": "Reforming of fossil fuels coupled with carbon capture and storage has the potential to produce low-carbon H2 at large scale and low cost. Adsorption is a potentially promising technology for two key separation tasks in this process: H2 purification and CO2 capture. In this work, we present equilibrium adsorption data of H2 and CH4 on zeolite 13X, in addition to the already established CO2 isotherms. Further, we carry out binary (CO2\u2013CH4) and ternary (H2\u2013CO2\u2013CH4) breakthrough experiments at various pressures and temperatures to estimate transport parameters, assess the predictive capacity of our 1D column model, and compare different multi-component adsorption models. CO2 adsorbs strongly on zeolite 13X, CH4 adsorbs less, and H2 adsorbs very little. Thus, H2 breaks through first, CH4 second (first in the binary breakthrough experiments) and CO2 last. Linear driving force (LDF) mass transfer coefficients are estimated based on a single breakthrough experiment and mass transfer is found to be fast for H2, slower for CH4, and slowest for CO2. The LDF parameters can be used in a predictive manner for breakthrough experiments at varying pressures, temperatures, flows, and, though with lower accuracy, even compositions. Heat transfer inside the column is described well with a literature correlation, thus yielding an excellent agreement between simulated and measured column temperatures. Ideal and real adsorbed solution theories (IAST and RAST, respectively) both model the observed breakthrough composition profiles well, whereas extended isotherms are inferior for predicting the competitive behavior between CH4 and CO2 adsorption. This study provides the groundwork necessary for full cyclic experiments and their simulation.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "5e06048a5a2aaf35c2e75f011fe17c3e75df3e42", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3365585", "CorpusId": 219845727}, "title": "The Role of Industrial Carbon Capture and Storage (Ccs) in Emission Mitigation", "abstract": "Abstract not provided to SSRN.", "year": 2019}]}
