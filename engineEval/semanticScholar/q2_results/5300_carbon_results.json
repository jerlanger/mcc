To mimic the dynamic process, two sandstones, Bentheimer and Nugget, were subjected to two successive drainage and imbibition (D-I) cycles and X-ray computed tomography scanned at each residual state to capture the wettability evolution at static conditions in the same pore geometry. Both sandstones contain similar grain size distributions, pore size distributions, and pore interconnectivity but differ in that the Nugget formation contains approximately half the porosity of the Bentheimer sandstone, and the pore network contains dead-end pores. scCO2 size distributions, strain calculations, and geometric contact angle measurements were used to characterize the curvature of scCO2 in different pore types between cycles. An increase in geometric contact angle was the greatest when advancement along the pore network of the same ganglion occurred between cycles while strain increased the most with pore-filling trapping. Moreover, Nugget sandstone results in a greater aggregated residual saturation and shows a clear increase in scCO2 sizes with an additional D-I cycle while scCO2 in the Bentheimer core shows a more complex response with some ganglion increasing and some decreasing in size with an additional D-I cycle. From this work, we suspect the pore geometry is playing a role in scCO2 size distributions and use this information to suggest using water pulses to enhance trapping capacity in lower porosity sandstones.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "4cf16e71bde67a8f3ee32da90936999f8aa544fd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2774372900", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-70548-4_317", "CorpusId": 102539191}, "title": "CO 2 Adsorption on Activated Carbon Based Olive Stone: A Comparison of Langmuir and Freundlich Models", "abstract": "Capture and storage of greenhouse gases, such as CO2, are a major technological and environmental challenge of the present time.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "eaf60321dbd297d5eb4d4b478916ecd489f4b21f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2761318080", "DOI": "10.15341/MESE(2333-2581)/06.03.2017/003", "CorpusId": 54998940}, "title": "Analysis of Civil Liability Regarding CCS: The Brazilian Case", "abstract": "Overview Global energy demand is still increasing based on consumption of fossil fuels, and its consequences such as greenhouse gases emissions (for instance CO2 emissions) are concerns for humanity due to the global warming.

CIUDEN is a research and development institution created by the Spanish Administration in 2006 and fully conceived for collaborative research in carbon capture, transport and storage, thus contributing to the strengthening of the industrial and technological base in Spain and by extension in Europe. The Technology Development Centre for CO2 Capture comprises two different technologies on oxycombustion: Pulverized Coal (PC) and Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB). This paper will focus on the design, characteristics, and initial operation of the 30 MWth oxy-CFB boiler. Foster Wheeler is the technology provider, and equipment supplier, of the 30 MWth Flexi-Burn\u00ae CFB unit, which was first fired with anthracite coal in September 2011. This CFB unit design allows multiple fuels to be tested either under conventional combustion with air or under oxyfuel conditions (Flexi-Burn\u00ae concept). Particular requirements of a testing unit are required, including a wide range of measurement points and the option to vary the operating conditions with the maximum flexibility and versatility possible. This paper includes the description of the facility and the testing program of CIUDEN Technology Development Centre for CO2 Capture in Northwestern Spain, in particular the 30MWth oxy-CFB. The configuration combines CFB\u2019s intrinsic advantages (fuel flexibility and low SOx and NOx emissions) with oxygen-firing for CCS. It must be pointed out that the CFB technology appears to be ideally well suited to oxygen-firing combustion. This oxy-CFB installation, which is the first of its class, will provide a real basis for the design and operation of flexible and competitive oxycombustion facilities at the demonstration scale, thus accelerating the deployment of CCS technologies.

An option for accomplishing that aim is the CO2 capture, utilization and storage technology (CCUS). It involves capturing CO2 from flue gas, transporting it, utilizing it for economically productive activities (CCU \u2013 carbon capture and utilization), and/or permanently disposing it in nonatmospheric sinks (CCS carbon capture and storage). Some technologies, such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) allow simultaneous CCUS [7], because CO2 is a well-recognized asset in the petroleum industry for the enhancement of oil extraction. Its use for enhanced oil recovery is a process that seeks to improve the flow and recovery rate of hydrocarbon from a reservoir (CO2-EOR) [5]. Unlike other options for CO2 utilization (e.g. use as a chemical feedstock), EOR can provide long-term storage and is able to increase the production of an economically valuable resource [6]. CO2-EOR is expected to produce additional 5\u201320% of the original oil in place (OOIP) [4] and it is also identified to have a strong potential to reduce the overall CCS cost, however the cost benefits are strongly dependent on the oil price and the considered EOR injection period [2]. CO2-EOR is usually a large-scale project and requires techno-economic evaluation before its deployment, a particularly important issue in this assessment is the availability of a low-cost source of CO2. The issue of selection of sources of CO2 for projects CCS-CO2-EOR is raised in a number of references [1\u20132, 4\u20137].

The Bowen ratio/energy balance (BREB) technique was used to determine CO2 fluxes over a moderately grazed mixed-grass prairie at Mandan, North Dakota, USA, over a 6-year period from 1996 to 2001. Above-ground biomass and leaf area index (LAI) were measured about every 21 days throughout the growing period. Root biomass was determined to 1.1 m depth in mid-July each year. Peak aboveground biomass typically occurred between mid-July to early August and ranged from 782 kg/ha in 1998 to 2173 kg/ha in 1999. Maximum LAI ranged from 0.4 in 1998 to 0.9 in 1999. Root biomass ranged from 11.8 Mg/ha in 1997 to 17.4 Mg/ha in 1996. Maximum daily CO2 fluxes generally coincided with periods of maximum LAI and above-ground green biomass. The average time period for CO2 uptake was 5 May to 3 October. Annual CO2 fluxes ranged from a low of 13 g CO2/m 2 in 1998 to a high of 247 g CO2/m 2 in 2001, nearly a 20-fold difference, and averaged 108 g CO2/m . The cumulative annual flux over all 6 years was 646 g CO2/m 2 or 176 g CO2-C/m . These results indicate that the strength of the carbon sink for this moderately grazed prairie site is about 30 g CO2-C/m /yr, which is quite small, but considering that the site was grazed and still remains a sink for carbon, it is significant. Carbon dioxide flux measurements have shown grasslands to be a net sink for atmospheric CO2 (Kim and others 1992, Dugas and others 1999, Frank and others 2000, Frank and Dugas 2001, Sims and Bradford 2001, Suyker and Verma 2001). Tropical forests are the largest terrestrial biomass sink for C, containing about 40% of the total C stored in terrestrial ecosystems (Dixon and others 1994). Grassland ecosystems comprise about one fifth of the earth\u2019s land surface and contain more than 10% of the global C stocks (Eswaran and others 1993). Temperate-region grassland ecosystems are well suited for storing soil organic carbon because of their extensive fibrous root systems, which makes these ecosystems important C sinks that must be considered for balancing the global C budget (Rastetter and others 1992, Sundquist 1993, Gifford 1994, Schimel 1995, Keeling and others 1996, Batjes 1998, Fan and others 1998). Native grasslands are highly resilient due to the highly diverse mixture of species that are adapted to the harsh conditions common to temperate grasslands. These factors make grasslands effective sequesters of atmospheric CO2 even though they generally occupy landscape sites that have less productive soils than cropland and are found in regions that receive limited precipitation. Seasonal flux measurements have shown that grasslands are a sink for atmospheric CO2, especially during periods of peak biomass accumulation. Kim and others (1992) reported average daily CO2 fluxes for a prairie site dominated by warm-season tallgrasses of 4.1 g CO2/ m/day from May through October. During the grassland senescence phase, the CO2 budget was in balance with the atmosphere, but during droughts and after senescence, the grassland was a source of CO2 with a flux of nearly 3 g CO2/m /day. Dugas and others (1999) reported an annual CO2 flux for a tallgrass prairie site of 0.7 g CO2/m /day. Frank and Dugas (2001) estimated an annual CO2 flux for a nongrazed mixed-grass prairie of 167 g CO2/m . The generally low productivity of grassland soils and the low precipitation amounts and nitrogen availability limit the potential of grassland ecosystems to capture and store C (Cole 1996, Houghton and others 1999). Others claim that the carbon budgets of grasslands are near equilibrium (Sims and Singh 1978, Bruce and others 1999). Estimating carbon storage potential of grasslands is difficult and requires long-term measurements because of the extensive vegetation diversity and climate variability in which they occur. Assuming the CO2 budget for this moderately grazed prairie site is near equilibrium, the objective of this research was to determine the annual CO2 flux for a moderately grazed mixed-grass prairie", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "91b9f94d37e4f426bfbff5069ae0d5aa07e755ee", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3164153309", "DOI": "10.1016/J.CARBON.2021.05.039", "CorpusId": 236245264}, "title": "Synergistically optimizing electronic structure and reducing ions transport resistance by oxygen functional groups and defects in carbon for superior sodium capture and potassium storage capability", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "d8aee52466b3467a2d9c9da613aee1b254bce627", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2470625387", "CorpusId": 99909507}, "title": "Palm-polyetheretherketone porous carbons as sorbents for gas adsorption applications", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) emission is attributed as the major contributing factor for global warming. Absorption with amine solutions is the technology that is currently used for CO2 capture in industries. Adsorption is seen as a viable alternative technology for CO2 capture due to the techno-economic reasons against the amine based technology. In this study, palm shell being one of the abundant biomass in Malaysia, was used together with polyetheretherketone (PEEK) as precursors for the preparation of porous carbons via microwave induced potassium carbonate chemical activation. The porous carbons were investigated as potential sorbents for high temperature CO2 capture and methane storage. Design expert software version 7.1.6. using central composite design coupled with surface response methodology was used in predicting and optimization of the preparation conditions of the porous carbons for CO2 capture. Effects of microwave power, amount of PEEK and irradiation time on the sorbent performance for CO2 adsorption were investigated. The characteristics of the porous carbons were studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, pH, thermogravimetric and derivative thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, nitrogen adsorption, proximate and ultimate analysis. The ideal CO2 adsorption capacities of porous carbons were determined using volumetric method at temperatures of 30 oC, 70 oC, 105 oC and 170 oC and pressures of 1 - 4 bar, while methane (CH4) adsorption was tested only at 30 oC. Microwave power was found to be the most significant factor influencing the porous carbon for CO2 adsorption. The optimum conditions were microwave power of 500 W, irradiation time of 6.89 min and amount of PEEK 21.91%. Highest CO2 uptake of 2.97 mmol CO2 adsorbed/g adsorbent was achieved by M4P2 (400 W of microwave power, 6 min irradiation time and 20% amount of PEEK) among the sorbents at 30 oC and 1 bar. Highest CH4 uptake of 1.144 mmol CH4 adsorbed/g adsorbent was also recorded by M4P0 (400 W of microwave power, 6 min irradiation time and 0% amount of PEEK) sorbent at 30 oC and 1 bar. The CO2 equilibrium data correlated well with Sips isotherms. In all scenarios studied, increase in temperature led to a decrease in CO2 adsorption while increase in pressure led to an increase in CO2 adsorption. The sorbents remained stable after seven CO2 adsorption/regeneration cycles. As a conclusion, the findings revealed the potential of palm shell-PEEK as CO2 and CH4 sorbents which needs improvement for further gas adsorption applications.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "e3100e1be3125a36c8ed40d0db80f20986317666", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2071216357", "DOI": "10.2478/NANOME-2012-0001", "CorpusId": 53541278}, "title": "Nanomaterials and the Environment:Global impact of tiny materials", "abstract": "It is an honor to introduce this inaugural volume of the new open access journal Nanomaterials and the Environment (NATE). The association of nanomaterials with the environment is a rapidly emerging and often controversial area, and it is important to have a journal that brings together key developments in this expanding scientific and engineering field, which disseminates new ideas and technical advances to audiences across the globe. Nanomaterials offer superior performance to their larger counterparts by scaling down the size of materials to a point where the surface atoms dominate the properties of the material or through a substantial increase in surface area. Whilst the early 1990s saw the explosion of nanomaterial research and development, natural nanomaterials have been present in society and nature for far longer. Though the exposure and impact of such nanomaterials on plant life and organisms is still under investigation, it is the contemporary, targeted large scale production and use of nanomaterials that represents a significant concern through nanomaterial release, migration, transformation and interaction with plants and organisms throughout the environment [1]. Through the implementation of responsible use of nanomaterials and extensive investigations of nanomaterial interaction with the environment, such risks can be mitigated or avoided, thus leaving the research community, industry and endusers to benefit from the use of nanotechnology. Increasing interest has developed in the use of nanomaterials in a wide variety of environmental applications, including, but not limited to, wastewater, groundwater, soil and air purification [2-6], drug delivery in the environment [7,8], capture and storage or recycling of greenhouse gases, critical metals and chemicals [9-13], the development of barriers, filters and sensors [14-18]. This has led to a phenomenal number of publications, patents and nanotechnology-based devices with an environmental consideration and is occurring alongside the emergence of standardized testing criteria, which is helping to inform legislation. The launching of NATE provides an exciting opportunity for a host journal that focuses specifically on environmental applications, implications, and other issues that link nanomaterials and the environment. This is a unique journal, with tremendous expected impact in the scientific literature and easy accessibility for scientists, stakeholders, and the public interested in the area of nanotechnology and nanomaterials. Exciting advances in open access publishing have rapidly unfolded as well, and we will take advantage of the best of these practices: rapid and transparent peer review; free access to readers around the world; indexing and database inclusion; low publication costs; and innovative dissemination through social media. The journal\u2019s advisory board has gathered a number of key academics in the field of nanoscience and the effect of nanomaterials in the environment, including Professor Sir Harold Kroto, 1996 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry for discovery of buckminster fullerenes (nanoscale all-carbon spheres). Our first original research article in NATE comes from Prof. Sakthi Kumar of Toyo University in Japan. Kumar and coauthors demonstrate that the biological sources, seed shell and meal, which are the byproducts of Jatropha biodiesel industry, can be efficiently utilized for the synthesis of near uniform gold nanoparticles, thus providing a green, renewable source of a reduction chemical in the synthesis of high purity, high quality nanomaterials.

The combustion of fossil fuels for energy production and transportation is a large contributor to the problem. One of the ways to reduce the amounts of CO2 being released from combustion is carbon capture and storage (CCS). Post-combustion is the capturing method which has been deemed the easiest to apply to existing power plants in a short period of time. Absorption of CO2 by MEA is the most common method used in post-combustion carbon capture, but there are still many aspects of the process that are not fully understood. Understanding the absorption mechanisms will make it easier to make more economical and environmentally friendly choices in the future. In this thesis the oxidative degradation of monoethanolamine (MEA) has been studied using an open batch setup. The stability of MEA has been studied under different temperatures and concentrations of oxygen in the gas stream. These experiments give a matrix of experiments performed at 55, 65 and 75 \u00b0C, with oxygen concentrations of 6, 21, 50 and 98% in the gas stream. To monitor how well the experimental results could be trusted, the water balance was maintained throughout the experiments, and the pH was measured in the flasks capturing volatile degradation compounds. To get a detailed picture of the degradation, the weight percent of nitrogen and the CO2 concentration has been found in the end samples, and the alkalinity and MEA concentration was found for all the samples. 11 known degradation compounds have been monitored for the different experiments, and the conditions these compounds are formed at have been compared with the suggested reaction mechanisms. 4 of the products were analyzed as anions using Ion chromatography (IC), and 7 secondary reaction products were analyzed as part of a degradation mix in LC-MS. The dependency of these compounds to temperature and oxygen conditions has been discussed. The primary degradation compounds seems to show a more direct correlation to oxygen flow or temperature, while the secondary degradation reaction shows a bigger variation of temperature and oxygen dependency relative to the conditions of the experiments. Various analytical methods for determination of the known compounds were used to determine the concentration of the degradation compounds in the experiments. The accuracy of these methods was investigated, and the results investigated for both LC-MS, GC-MS and IC-EC, showed large variations.

The main purpose of this research was to comparatively determine carbon storage in the soil and litter of three forest systems in the Western Amazon (Brazil): upland forest, shrublands and grasslands. Duration of Study: Dry and rainy periods between 2005 and 2012. Methodology: Diverse soil analysis including density, porosity, particle-size, total carbon (TC and TOC) were developed according to traditional methods. Multivariate analysis (MANOVA) and Tukey\u2019s test were applied to the results. Results and Conclusion: Total C storage C ranged from 23 to 26 Mg ha in the grasslands to 28 to 37 Mg ha in the shrublands.

This study aimed to explore the potential of canopy spectra of coastal wetland vegetation in estimating the organic carbon content of aboveground vegetation (OCCAV). A total of 54 representative vegetation quadrats were selected from coastal wetlands in Jiangsu Province, China, and their canopy reflectance spectra were measured using an in situ field spectrometer. In particular, two advanced spectral algorithms, fractional-order derivative (FOD) and optimal band combination algorithm, were used for spectral pre-treatments. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to establish the OCCAV estimation models. Accuracies of the models constructed by the processed spectral parameters were compared with that of the models corresponding to five traditional pre-treatment methods and 15 common vegetation indices. Results showed that the FOD method captured subtler spectral characteristics than the first and second derivatives. The optimal estimation accuracies of PLSR and SVM models were obtained based on 0.75 and 1.50 order derivative spectra, respectively, and the ratios of performance to interquartile range (RPIQ) of the models were 2.57 and 2.97, respectively. Moreover, the optimal band combination algorithm effectively extracted the sensitive spectral parameters related to OCCAV, and the accuracy of the model established based on the spectral parameters extracted by this algorithm was generally better than that of the model obtained by the common vegetation indices. The optimal estimation result was achieved by the SVM model based on the optimized ratio vegetation index, with an RPIQ of 3.10. In summary, this research provides a theoretical basis for future studies on estimating the organic carbon and carbon storage of wetland vegetation based on large-scale canopy hyperspectral images and also helps to improve the knowledge of the carbon cycle of wetland ecosystems.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "3ddd12cdb7cf25c1cbc9ce71aaee2c95ff58c633", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2885996301", "DOI": "10.1002/9781119231059.CH4", "CorpusId": 106384005}, "title": "In Situ Diffraction Studies of Selected Metal-Organic Framework Materials for Guest Capture/Exchange Applications", "abstract": "CO2 is known to be the main anthropogenic contributor to the global climate change, and carbon mitigation approaches are critical for maintaining a sustainable future [1, 2].

The use of kenaf as adsorbent is seen as an attractive and innovative method, and it has been used for various adsorptions. Adsorption is a promising technology that has the ability to capture carbon dioxide (CO2), the predominant contributor of global climate change. Inspired by the established and well\u2013known amine\u2013based absorption process of carbon capture and storage technology, the development towards new adsorbent by introducing amine functional group has been studied. Therefore, this study explores the potential of modified kenaf as adsorbent by incorporating amine functional group on the surface and investigates the CO2 adsorptive characteristics of amine\u2013modified kenaf adsorbent using pressure swing adsorption system (PSA). The preparation of amine\u2013modified kenaf was conducted via the incipient wetness impregnation technique. The physical and structural characteristics of amine\u2013modified kenaf were determined via micromeritics 3 flex, field emission scanning electrons microscopy, energy dispersive x\u2013ray, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analyzer. The results show that the types of amine, amine loading concentration, and impregnation time affect the physical and structural properties of kenaf and thus affecting the capability for capturing CO2. Screening of various types of amines via PSA revealed that tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA) has recorded the highest CO2 adsorption (0.914 mmol/g). Further examination on amine loading divulged that kenaf to TEPA ratio of 1:2 presents the highest CO2 adsorption (2.086 mmol/g) with 5 hour impregnation time. To examine the utilization of amine\u2013modified kenaf adsorbent in PSA system, pressure bed, adsorption time, and feed flowing rate were evaluated. The result revealed that these parameters affect the gas adsorption of amine\u2013modified kenaf adsorbent. The regeneration study had shown that kenaf adsorbent could sustain the repeated adsorption/desorption cyclic operations. This study also found that physical and chemical adsorption occurred during the adsorption of CO2 on raw kenaf and amine\u2013modified kenaf.

The CCUS associated with natural gas processing carries the lowest cost compared to other industries because production of concentrated CO2 streams is already part of the gas production process. Transport and storage remain the highest cost components of CCUS for natural gas production. Ranges of storage and transportation costs based on different publicly available data are ~US$2\u201340/tCO2 and ~US$2\u201310/tCO2 respectively.

It was found that the dissolution efficiency of Mg was 64 and 72 % at 200 and 300 g/l, respectively. The increase of dissolution efficiency with a solid to liquid ratio could be explained by the removal of passive product layer caused by particle-particle interaction. At a solid to liquid ratio of 300 g/l, the highest carbonation efficiency achieved was 65.4 %. Magnesite instead of hydromagnesite was found after carbonation due to the CO\u2082 pressure caused by the decomposition of ammonium salts above 70 \u00b0C. Additionally, the carbonation efficiency was doubled by using (NH\u2084)\u2082CO\u2083compared to that using NH\u2084HCO\u2083.\n\nA preliminary evaluation was conducted to estimate the OPEX, including energy consumption, chemical costs and feedstock cost, based on the experimental results from the two process routes developed. In order to get low OPEX, the optimization process conditions, such as solid to liquid ratio and reaction time, were determined. Then, experiments at these optimized conditions were conducted. The dissolution efficiency of Mg from serpentine with particle size 75-150 pm using 2.8 M NH\u2084HSO\u2084at 100 g/l solid to liquid ratio for 1h was around 80 %. The carbonation efficiency was 96 % when the molar ratio of Mg: CO\u2082 containing NH\u2074+ salts: NH\u2083was 1: 1.5: 2. Thus, the mass balance of the process showed that 3.0 t' of serpentine, 0.2 t of NH\u2084HSO\u2084and 0.1 t of NH\u2083 were required to sequester 1t of CO\u2082and produce 1.9 t of magnesite. Moreover, 1.7 t of high Si content (46.9 wt. %) and 0.3 t of high Fe content (60 wt. %) were produced.\n\nFinally, a cost evaluation study including CAPEX and OPEX was made using Aspen plus software to simulate the optimized CCSM process with recyclable ammonium salts for a 100 MW coal-fired power plant. For the input of 60 t/h CO\u2082, 93 % of them can be sequestered by the process with 29.5 % energy consumption and the total carbon capture and storage costs was 71.8 US$/t CO\u2082sequestered, excluding the product sale.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "3493bd53441378d83a0fa4147770773cef8b046f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2246670513", "CorpusId": 111698258}, "title": "Demonstrating Pre-combustion CO2 Capture Using Solvent Technology", "abstract": "Demonstrating capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) from emission sources on a pilot plant scale is a significant step towards commercialisation of carbon capture and storage technology.

Today's electricity generation is highly dependent on combustion of fossil fuel. This leads to emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Increased atmospheric CO2 concentration results in higher average surface temperature and climate change. \n \nA short- and medium term method to decrease the carbon dioxide emissions is carbon capture and storage.This method captures carbon dioxide from point sources of emissions and then stores the carbon dioxide in geological formations. In this thesis two different types of combined cycles that are well suited for carbon capture and storage are introduced and analysed. The cycles are the Graz cycle and the Semi Closed Oxy-fuel Combustion Cycle (SCOC-CC). The net power output of the conceptual designs analysed here are around 100 MW, which is in the mid-size power output range. The simulation of the two cycles shows promising results and high efficiencies. The Graz cycle net efficiency is around 49% and the SCOC-CC net efficiency is around 46%. \n \nThe combustion in the cycles takes place using only oxygen as oxidizer instead of air. The combustion products will mainly be steam and carbon dioxide. This influences the properties of the working media in the gas turbines used in the cycles. \nTraditional design tools for the gas turbine therefore needs modification. The thesis describes the conceptual design tool used to design the compressor part of the gas turbines. The tool is based on a one dimensional model that uses empirical data to compute losses. The thesis also describes the development of a two dimensional compressor design method. \n \nTwo different layouts of the gas turbine were studied for the SCOC-CC, a one shaft configuration and a two shaft configuration. The one shaft configuration resulted in a compressor design that was relative bulky, with 18 stages. The two shaft configuration resulted in a more favourable compressor design with 14 stages. \n \nThe design of the gas turbine for the Graz cycle has both benefits and disadvantages originating from the fact the working fluid in the Graz cycle has a higher fraction of steam compared to the SCOC-CC. This difference in the working fluid will result in that the turbomachinery will be smaller for the Graz cycle compared to the SCOC-CC. This however also results in that the heights of the blades in the rear stages of the compressor will be relatively small. This will result in a higher amount of losses generated in the rear stages.

Support for research and development and for structural change in transmission infrastructure will allow Australia's natural endowments in renewable energy to be efficiently brought to account. The interaction of the emissions trading scheme with support for research, development and commercialisation will assist transition to a near-zero emissions energy sector by mid century. The future for coal-based electricity generation, both domestic and exported, and for mitigation in developing Asia depends on carbon capture and storage becoming commercially effective.

To have a high likelihood of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, large-scale mitigation of GHG has to start being implemented and cause emissions to fall well before Year 2030. The process industry, including the iron and steel industry, is inherently carbon-intensive and carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the few options available to achieve the required reductions in carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Despite its high technological maturity, CCS is not being implemented at the expected rates due inter alia to the low value creation of CCS for process industries, which is often attributed to uncertainties related to carbon pricing and the considerable investments required in CO2 capture. This thesis deals with the concept of partial carbon capture, which is governed by market or site conditions and aims to capture a smaller fraction of the CO2 emissions from an industrial site, thereby lowering the absolute and specific costs (\u20ac per tonne CO2) for CO2 capture, as compared to a conventional full-capture process. Depending on the scale and market conditions these savings hold true especially for a process industry that has large gas flows with concentrations of CO2 \u226520 vol.% and access to low-value heat. Integrated steel mills typically fulfill these conditions. The value of partial capture for the steel industry is assessed in a techno-economic study on the separation of CO2 from the most carbon-intensive steel mill off-gases. The design for partial carbon capture using a 30 wt.% aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA) solvent is optimized for lower cost. Powering the capture process exclusively with excess heat entails a cost of 28\u201335\u00a0(\u00b14)\u00a0\u20ac/tonne CO2-captured and a reduction in CO2 emissions of 19%\u2013\u00a043% onsite, depending on design and CO2 source. In contrast, full capture requires external energy to reduce the CO2 site emissions by 76%, entailing costs in the range of 39\u201354 (\u00b15) \u20ac/tonne CO2-captured. Furthermore, the use of excess heat has impacts on the cost structure of partial carbon capture, i.e., increasing the ratio of capital expenditures to operational expenditures, as well as on the relationship between carbon and energy intensity for primary steel as an industrial product. The present work concludes that near-term implementation of partial carbon capture in the 2020s will be economically sustainable if average carbon prices are in the range of 40\u201360 \u20ac/tonne CO2 over the entire economic life-time of the partial capture unit (ca. 25 years). Once implemented, partial capture could evolve to full capture over time through either co-mitigation (e.g., with biomass utilization or electrification) or efficiency improvements. Alternatively, partial capture could act as a bridging-technology for new, carbon-free production. In summary, partial carbon capture is found to be readily available and potentially economically viable to initiate large-scale mitigation before Year 2030. Partial capture may represent a starting point for the transition to the carbon-constrained economies of the future in line with the 1.5\u00b0C target.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "2b8b81d537796768a21242e99a1e52a833305e0f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3204011747", "DOI": "10.1007/s40518-021-00195-3", "CorpusId": 244213971}, "title": "Decarbonising Industry via BECCS: Promising Sectors, Challenges, and Techno-economic Limits of Negative Emissions", "abstract": "\n \n This paper reviews recent literature on the combined use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in the industries of steel, cement, paper, ethanol, and chemicals, focusing on estimates of potential costs and the possibility of achieving \u201cnegative emissions\u201d.\n \n \n Bioethanol is seen as a potential near-term source of negative emissions, with CO2 transport as the main cost limitation.

Selective anthropogenic enrichment of the atmospheric carbon pool is causing dire environmental problems, thereby necessitating remediation by mitigation. Algae possess efficient carbon concentrating mechanisms and consequently high photosynthetic rates which make them suitable candidates for biosequestration of CO2. Globally, nearly half of the atmospheric oxygen is generated by algal photosynthesis despite the fact that algae account for less than 1% of photosynthetic biomass. In water bodies, algae are responsible for creating the \u2018biological pump\u2019 that transports carbon from the upper sunlit waters to the depth below. A diverse array of photoautotrophs ranging from prokaryotic cyanobacteria to eukaryotic algae such as Chlorophytes, and even protists like euglenoids, contribute to this \u2018biological pump\u2019. It operates in a variety of aquatic ecosystems ranging from small freshwater ponds to the oceans where it has been most extensively studied.

The purpose of this study was to simulate the seismic response of the BCS after injecting 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 during a one-year period of injection. This was done using Gassmann fluid substitution and seismic forward modeling. A geological model for the baseline scenario was generated based on logs from well SCL-8-19-59-20W4.

Numerical stack sections for both scenarios were obtained and subtracted to study the change in the seismic response after injecting CO2. The difference section shows the location and the spatial distribution of the plume.

Carbon sequestration levels may however differ greatly among meadows depending on, among other factors, the plant community composition. Tropical seagrass meadows are often intermixed with macroalgae, many of which are calcareous, which may compete with seagrass for nutrients, light, and space. While the photosynthetic CO2 uptake by both seagrasses and calcareous algae may increase the overall calcification in the system (by increasing the calcium carbonate saturation state, \u2126), the calcification process of calcareous algae may lead to a release of CO2, thereby affecting both productivity and calcification, and eventually also the meadows\u2019 carbon storage. This study estimated how plant productivity, CaCO3 production, and sediment carbon levels were affected by plant community composition (seagrass and calcareous algae) in a tropical seagrass\u2010dominated embayment (Zanzibar, Tanzania). Overall, the patterns of variability in productivity differed between the plant types, with net areal biomass productivity being highest in meadows containing both seagrass and calcareous algae. Low and moderate densities of calcareous algae enhanced seagrass biomass growth, while the presence of seagrass reduced the productivity of calcareous algae but increased their CaCO3 content. Sedimentary carbon levels were highest when seagrasses were mixed with low or moderate cover of calcareous algae. The findings show that plant community composition can be an important driver for ecosystem productivity and blue carbon sequestration.", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "df871e3afc5d932985b348628a5cd93d7e85a195", "externalIds": {"MAG": "582941688", "CorpusId": 92763269}, "title": "System design and thermodynamic evaluation of natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) systems including carbon capture and storage (CCS) and metal hydride based hydrogen storage", "abstract": "Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) systems including Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) and Metal Hydride (MH) based hydrogen storage seem to be an attractive technology for near future power production owing to reduced Greenhouse Gases emissions, increased flexibility and relatively high efficiency. The system design and the thermodynamic evaluation including a second law analysis of large scale natural gas combined cycle systems including CCS combined with MH based hydrogen storage has not been studied so far. The major challenges in the development of these system models are related to process design, system integration and heat management due to the different nature of the metal hydride charging (exothermic) and discharging (endothermic) reactions. The current work presents a thermodynamic system analysis of such a system using ASPEN Plus steady state models. A pre-combustion capture option is chosen in order to facilitate hydrogen co-production and hydrogen storage. In order to understand the effect of capture and H2 storage on NGCC plants, the study has been performed by developing three system models; a reference NGCC system model including a triple steam pressure Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), a NGCC system model including pre-combustion CO2 capture utilizing a Gas Heated Reformer - Auto Thermal Reformer (GHR-ATR) and a Sorption Enhanced Water Gas Shift (SEWGS) and lastly a NGCC system with both CO2 capture and MH based H2 storage. Parameters of applied equipment are defined on the assumptions and parameters based on the activities of three CCS R&D projects. The NGCC system with both CO2 capture and MH based H2 storage includes the system design and the analysis of the system performance of a high temperature and low temperature MH during charging and discharging. The MH system model includes most relevant features of the MH storage system for this application like gas cleaning, adsorption/desorption kinetics and isothermal operation. Magnesium hydride (MgH2) and sodium alanate (Na3AlH6) has been selected as respectively the high temperature and low temperature metal hydride based on operating conditions and MH properties. Heat transfer oil is used to facilitate heat transfer between the MH system and the HRSG. Charge and discharge operation with a hydrogen split of 50% of the hydrogen rich stream has been assumed based on current daily load curves and the practical operation range of NGCC systems. The total input of natural gas was maintained constant during the different cases. An electrical efficiency of 59.9% and a net power output of 431.2 MW has been obtained for the reference NGCC system which is comparable to similar systems described in literature. The NGCC including CCS shows a net power output of 348.2 MW and an electrical efficiency of 48.4% with a Carbon Capture Ratio (CCR) of 0.953. The large reduction in electrical efficiency of (-11.5%) with respect to the reference NGCC system is related to the large power requirement for the Air Separation Unit (ASU), the CO2 compressor and the additional steam requirement for the reforming of natural gas and the rinse and purge process of the SEWGS unit. The overall electrical efficiency of the NGCC system including CCS for the magnesium hydride (MgH2) case and the sodium alanate (Na3AlH6) case are respectively 48.1% and 47.4%. The reduction in the performance with respect to the NGCC system including CCS is relatively low for a hydrogen storage capacity of 50%. This makes metal hydride based hydrogen storage an interesting technology to increase the reliability and flexibility of future power production with less capital and operational costs. The observed difference in the overall electrical efficiency between both MH cases can be explained by the differences in heat utilization during adsorption and desorption of hydrogen. The obtained results and the composite curves show a high sensitivity between the selection of the steam pressure levels in the steam cycle and the operating conditions of the MH storage system to the overall performance. Therefore, it is recommended to do a more profound sensitivity analysis on the steam pressure level in order to improve system performances of both storage systems. Furthermore, a major constraint for both charging cases is the small temperature difference obtained between the hot curve and cold curve in the economizer section of the HRSG resulting in a large required economizer. A 2nd law analysis shows the major irreversibilities for the different cases in the combustor, the air compressor, the gas turbine and the GHR-ATR. The additional losses in the GHR-ATR substantiates the large reduction in power output in the CO2 capture system. The total exergy efficiency of the MgH2 storage system is 64.7% and is comparable to other storage systems integrated in NGCC systems like Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES). Further investigations are required to predict accurately the irreversibilities in the subcomponents of the system due to incorrect exergy calculations by Aspen Plus and an inappropriate formulation to calculate the chemical exergy.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "394a5b70f52c490448a9c873c26395da1b18d80d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2132097214", "DOI": "10.5194/HESS-14-2099-2010", "CorpusId": 4977822}, "title": "Modeling the monthly mean soil-water balance with a statistical-dynamical ecohydrology model as coupled to a two-component canopy model", "abstract": "Abstract. The statistical-dynamical annual water balance model of Eagleson (1978) is a pioneering work in the analysis of climate, soil and vegetation interactions. This paper describes several enhancements and modifications to the model that improve its physical realism at the expense of its mathematical elegance and analytical tractability. In particular, the analytical solutions for the root zone fluxes are re-derived using separate potential rates of transpiration and bare-soil evaporation. Those potential rates, along with the rate of evaporation from canopy interception, are calculated using the two-component Shuttleworth-Wallace (1985) canopy model. In addition, the soil column is divided into two layers, with the upper layer representing the dynamic root zone. The resulting ability to account for changes in root-zone water storage allows for implementation at the monthly timescale. This new version of the Eagleson model is coined the Statistical-Dynamical Ecohydrology Model (SDEM). The ability of the SDEM to capture the seasonal dynamics of the local-scale soil-water balance is demonstrated for two grassland sites in the US Great Plains. Sensitivity of the results to variations in peak green leaf area index (LAI) suggests that the mean peak green LAI is determined by some minimum in root zone soil moisture during the growing season. That minimum appears to be close to the soil matric potential at which the dominant grass species begins to experience water stress and well above the wilting point, thereby suggesting an ecological optimality hypothesis in which the need to avoid water-stress-induced leaf abscission is balanced by the maximization of carbon assimilation (and associated transpiration). Finally, analysis of the sensitivity of model-determined peak green LAI to soil texture shows that the coupled model is able to reproduce the so-called \"inverse texture effect\", which consists of the observation that natural vegetation in dry climates tends to be most productive in sandier soils despite their lower water holding capacity. Although the determination of LAI based on complete or near-complete utilization of soil moisture is not a new approach in ecohydrology, this paper demonstrates its use for the first time with a new monthly statistical-dynamical model of the water balance. Accordingly, the SDEM provides a new framework for studying the controls of soil texture and climate on vegetation density and evapotranspiration.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "83698f8a58aec883c73705151df7feae499e04d4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1529601463", "CorpusId": 109106727}, "title": "Assessing industrial energy use and CO2 emissions : Opportunities for energy efficiency, biomass and CCS", "abstract": "A large body of literature deals with issues related to monitoring of industrial energy use and CO2 emissions, assessment of the potentials of low-carbon technologies and the development of long term scenarios. However, in these assessments knowledge gaps and large uncertainties continue to exist. More analysis can improve the evaluation of past energy and climate policies and help to develop policies for the future. Primarily, our understanding of current and past industrial energy use needs to be improved. Furthermore, historical findings of industrial energy use need to be better integrated with the projections of long-term industrial energy use to quantify the potentials of improving energy efficiency. Finally, the technical and economic potentials of other low-carbon technologies need to be studied in order to understand to which extent they can contribute to CO2 emission reductions in the industry. In this thesis, the opportunities of the industrial use of biomass and application of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) are studied in relation to the potentials for energy efficiency improvement. For these technologies, most analyses quantify the potentials for a specific industrial process only and only few of them quantify the sector level potentials of technologies by covering as many countries as possible. These knowledge gaps form the starting points of our research where we address three research questions related to industrial energy use and CO2 emissions: (i) What is the current industrial energy use (based on energy use data and production volumes available at sector and plant level) and what are the short-term energy efficiency improvement potentials in industry in OECD and non-OECD countries based on best practice technologies? (ii) Which rates of annual energy efficiency improvements did the industry sectors achieve in the past and to which extent can energy efficiency technologies accelerate the rates of improvement in future? (iii) Which industry sectors have the largest technical and economic potentials for CO2 capture and storage (CCS) and biomass use and to what extent can these technologies contribute to the reduction of industrial CO2 emissions? The thesis provides for the first time a compilation of benchmark curves for a substantial number of sectors. For those sectors producing numerous products (e.g., iron and steel sector), the analysis is complemented by developing Energy Efficiency Index (EEI) values which is an indicator relating a sector\u2019s total final energy use according to the international energy statistics to its energy use if all of its processes were operated at the level of BPT. This combination of methodologies allows to provide estimates of current energy use and the energy saving potentials for sectors which are often excluded from such analysis. Specific to the chemical and petrochemical sector, we analyzed its current and BPT energy uses by estimating EEI values based on two approaches. For various industry sectors, our research quantifies the short term potentials of energy efficiency, but both analyses are subject to uncertainties and therefore data quality needs to be improved for target setting and country comparisons. The thesis provides valuable information for the industry sector with regard to the technical and economic potentials of energy efficiency technologies, CCS and biomass use. As opposed to literature which often focuses on generic process designs, the thesis quantifies the potentials at sector level by covering a large share of industrial fossil fuel demand and the related CO2 emissions. The research also identifies the R&D focus areas and the policy needs required to develop these technologies as well as the extent to which energy efficiency technologies, CCS and biomass can jointly contribute to meet the goals of ambitious climate policies for the industry sector. The sector level analyses, however, need to be improved and supported by plant level analysis since we rely on various assumptions and generic data.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "5a18f38253f2a7df3719f3e800b749be182fefa0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2378038531", "CorpusId": 167235434}, "title": "China's Energy Saving and Carbon Dioxide Emission Reduction Potential of Main Industries Technology and Its Realizing Way", "abstract": "This paper analyses the energy predication and consumption patterns since the 21st century in China,especially in the energy consumption of the energy-intensive industries.Meanwhile,it compares the gap between China's per unit product energy consumption of the relatively energy-intensive industries with the international advanced level.To the gap and major problems,it probes into China's potential of the energy-intensive industries in energy-saving and carbon emission reduction.Through energy-saving and carbon dioxide emissions of the energy-intensive industries,in the national total targets that reduce 40% to 45% of carbon dioxide of per unit GDP in 2020,it probes into the contribution rate and the contribution scale of the energy saving industrial technology of the relatively energy-intensive industries.Through technological progress of the coal,the iron and steel,the non-ferrous metals,the building materials,the petrochemical,the chemical,the coal mining,the oil and gas mining and other major energy-intensive industries,it is forecasted that the energy-saving potential of industrial technology would realize 51560\u00d7104-52000\u00d7104 tec and would reduce carbon dioxide by a total size of 125800\u00d7104-126880\u00d7104 t.Carbon dioxide emissions in the entire unit of GDP would decrease by 40% to 45% of the national target in 2020,the energy saving and carbon emission of industrial technology accounts for the contribution rate of 15.5%-16.5%,and will not be able to assume primary responsibility for achieving national target.In addition,China's industrial technology for energy saving potential and carbon emission reduction for further expansion,the future path of the main energy saving was discussed.Included the steady progress of the CCS projects(Carbon Capture and Storage)in the energy-intensive industries,backward technology and equipment and new material to speed up the elimination industry to achieve economies of scale enterprise development,strong industry association to promote industrial parks and guide the development of circular economy,strengthen the establishment of cleaner production organization and promote comprehensive utilization of resources.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "6a655f2315cd54aec6e4d594396a0cb71fa5e0c3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2312449291", "DOI": "10.1190/SEGAM2014-1081.1", "CorpusId": 111517937}, "title": "Towards a new Approach for Time-lapse Seismic Using Permanent Seismic Source ACROSS and Elastic Full Waveform Inversion", "abstract": "Source repeatability is one of the most important problems in time-lapse seismic and reservoir monitoring. We introduce a new time-lapse approach using a permanent seismic source ACROSS (Accurately Controlled and Routinely Operated Signal System) and elastic full waveform inversion. The ACROSS source, fixed in cement at surface, can produce repeatable, extremely precise two-component seismic signal. We first performed field data observation at a Kashiwazaki test field, Niigata, Japan using two ACROSS sources with sweep frequency ranging between 5-50 Hz. Signals from each ACROSS source are clearly separated owing to an accurate source control, and transfer functions (or shot gathers) corresponding to each ACROSS are generated. The waveforms arriving before surface waves, mostly P-wave related, show little waveform changes over time and confirm excellent source repeatability. With the assumption that two ACROSS sources are installed at a CCS (carbon capture and storage) field, we performed 2D simulation study using time-lapse elastic full waveform inversion (FWI) for differential P-wave velocity. Since ACROSS precisely controls the sweep source signature, it is more suitable to apply elastic algorithm than conventional acoustic method. To simplify the multi-component and multiparameter problems on elastic FWI, we invert only for P-wave velocity residual using so-called scalar potential of the elastic wavefields to prevent from crosstalks caused by Pand S-wave interference. The synthetic FWI result shows sharp delineation of P-wave velocity residual associated with fluid replacement.

Therefore, a CO 2 capture rate of 88% only results in a reduction of greenhouse gases by around 67% - 78%. b) Depending on the growth rates and the market development renewables could develop faster and become cheaper than CCS plants in the long term. c) From an energy economic perspective the development of the electricity generation and the resulting demand for new plants over time is the crucial factor determining the potential for CCS in Germany. This means that retrofit of CCS and capture ready concepts are gaining more and more importance.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "397a11de6a5593da49fe842276a8a6a68cc7cfa3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2319779691", "DOI": "10.5026/JGEOGRAPHY.120.944", "CorpusId": 131304546}, "title": "Relative Permeability of Water and Supercritical CO2 System under Steady-state Flow Conditions in Porous Sandstones", "abstract": "Relative permeability curves of water and supercritical CO2 (scCO2) were obtained for two porous sandstones under steady-state flow conditions. The present measurements provide accurate relative permeability values for water and scCO2, which is important to better understand the behavior of CO2 injected into the deep saline aquifer when carrying out carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS).\u2003We have developed a new method for measuring the volume of scCO2 and water under the same pressure and temperature conditions as in the porous rock employing a high-pressure water-CO2 separator. Water saturation in the sandstone was determined with a mass balance analysis measuring changes of the surface boundary between water and scCO2. We measured Berea sandstone and Tako sandstone, which were cored and shaped into a cylinder form. The mixed fluid of water and scCO2 was injected into a rock sample that was previously saturated with CO2-saturated water. The flow volumes of the water and scCO2 were measured for different saturation conditions by changing the mixing ratio of the fluids at the sample inlet. All measurements were made at 40\u00b0C and 10 MPa, including those for the water-CO2 separator. The injection flow rate was 0.5 ml/min. By plotting the ratios of water and scCO2 of the inflow and outflow with respect to elapsed time, we can determine whether the flow is steady or unsteady.\u2003The relative permeability curve is obtained by plotting the relative permeability values with respect to the degree of water saturation. The results for Berea sandstone suggest that the relationship between relative permeability and the relative saturation of water and scCO2 correspond well to those of the previous study. However, the results for Tako sandstone deviate from the predicted curve of the previous study. This is likely to be due to the heterogeneity of Tako sandstone.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "b2b7350939e31a4f9d70155e01be3db6fb9bb4a8", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 15014386}, "title": "Of Oil Yields from Enhanced Oil Recovery (eor) and Co 2 Storage Fossil Energy Techline, \" Secretary Chu Announces up to $154 Million for Nrg Energy's Carbon Capture and Storage Project in Texas. \"", "abstract": "capacity in depleted oil reservoirs.

Various carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies are available worldwide but post combustion CO2 capture with chemical absorbents is considered today to be the most advanced and mature technology for mitigating CO2 emissions from burning fossil fuels. Implementing CCS has the potential of reducing and reversing the effects of CO2 on global warming and climate change.In reactive absorption, carbon dioxide chemically reacts to form chemical bond and is thereby moved from a gas to a liquid phase. The chemical reaction is reversible and CO2 is released from the solvent during regeneration by raising the temperature. Thereby almost pure CO2 is collected, compressed and sent to storage and the regenerated solvent is sent for re-use. Amines are usually employed as absorbents for CO2 capture and monoethanolamine (MEA), diisopropanolamine (DIPA), N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and 2-amino-2- methyl-1-propanol (AMP) are commonly used. However, due to problems associated with alkanolamines, such as their degradation in oxygen rich atmospheres, considerable energy need for solvent regeneration, environmental issues and recycling efficiency, the quest to find alternative candidates is very important.In this work spectroscopic methods, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), are used, to both qualitatively and quantitatively characterize a range of absorbents for CO2 capture including primary, secondary, tertiary or blended amine systems in addition to amine-amino acid absorbents.Liquid phase speciation is one of the most important experimental data for thermodynamic and kinetic modeling of absorption systems. First a comprehensive standard method for liquid phase speciation in amine and amino acid-CO2-H2O systems by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is presented and validated against measurements on monoamine, diamine and amine-amino acid systems. This method was then used for all our measurements presented in the current work. These measurements provide valuable information about the parameters that should be considered when studying different amine, amine-amino acid-CO2-H2O system by NMR spectroscopy.Carbamate stability is a very important parameter for determining the absorption capacity and regeneration energy requirement. Therefore, 13C-NMR was employed to study the carbamate formation and to estimate the apparent carbamate stability constant in aqueous solutions of CO2 and sterically hindered amine, 2-amion-2-methyl-propan-ol, (AMP) at different temperatures. In order to determine the apparent carbamate stability constant of AMP, a method for separating amine/protonated amine and bicarbonate/carbonate was developed and presented in our work. The apparent carbamate stability constant was reported to be loading and temperature dependency.Phase change solvents for CO2 capture was another important topic where our research was also focused. Liquid phase speciation of blended aqueous solutions of DEEA/MAPA/CO2/H2O as well as unblended MAPA/CO2/H2O and DEEA/CO2/H2O system is presented here. One of the most important information we can gain from 13CNMR spectroscopy is the ability to distinguish between primary, secondary, di-carbamate and carbonate/bicarbonate species. Blended system of DEEA/MAPA can form two liquid phases after being loaded with CO2 and both phases were analyzed quantitatively by NMR spectroscopy.Qualitative and quantitative NMR experiments to investigate the liquid phase speciation in amino acids (Glycine, L-Alanine, Taurine, L-Serine and L-Proline) neutralized by equimolar quantities of monoethanolamine amine (MEA) and 2-amino-2-methyl-1- propanol (AMP) were performed at 25\u00b0C for different CO2 loadings. AMP was found to have better performance in neutralizing the amino acids and enhancing the bicarbonate/carbonate formation.Further, studies were performed to develop calibration models for prediction of various systems using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Multivariate data analyses were performed to develop the models. Online analysis of monoethanolamine solvent in a pilot plant was demonstrated by application of the developed model using a mobile setup for extractive sampling to an FTIR analyzer. These results showed the possibility of developing a comprehensive multivariate calibrated model such as Partial Least Square (PLS) for on-line prediction and is well suited for analysis of amine solvents, both in the lab and for online process monitoring.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "3466658da5f30db2781f2c5c554f32e71214b313", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2923200640", "DOI": "10.25073/2588-1140/VNUNST.4807", "CorpusId": 188601841}, "title": "Synthesis of FeCo-MIL-88B and Investigate Its Potential for CO2 Capture", "abstract": "Cobalt dopping Fe-MIL-88B were successfully synthesized -in solvothermal procedure using DMF as solvent and with/without NaOH.

Crystallizations conducted in NaOH medium, however, results in rod like with 2-end octahedral shape crystals. The BET specific surface area is 139cm2/g. The TGA data indicated that the presence of Co resulted in an increase in thermal stability of synthesized samples compared to parent Fe-MIL-88B.

The most significant impurity in raw biogas is typically carbon dioxide, composing up to 50% of biogas volume. Carbon dioxide capture is therefore an important part of the upgrading process which in turn raises the question of the availability of final carbon storage. This problem can be addressed by using calcium hydroxide solution or other lime-based solvents as scrubber in carbon dioxide capture via carbonation where precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC) is formed as a by-product. This paper reviews the viability of packed column, bubble column, and spray column for simultaneous biogas purification by CO2 capture and PCC synthesis, as well as examining various parameters that affect both carbon dioxide capture and the production of PCC. Among the three reviewed types of contactors, only packed column is deemed unsuitable for the simultaneous process. The optimal condition for both carbon dioxide scrubbing efficiency and PCC yield can be obtained by using a high liquid flow rate, low gas flow rate, and high solvent concentration.

To describe the fracture reactivation, the modified Barton\u2013Bandis model is applied. In order to generate hydro-geomechanically heterogeneous fields, the negative correlation between porosity and Young\u2019s modulus/Poisson\u2019s ratio is applied.

In Netherlands, the option of CCS has been the subject of debate for a long time, as three unsuccessful projects \u2013 two onshore in Barendrecht and the Northern regions, and one offshore near the Port of Rotterdam \u2013 demonstrate. Nevertheless, CCS has been accorded an important place in the current Dutch climate policies, being expected to contribute up to 7 Megaton of CO2 reduction. This is reflected in a fresh crop of CCS project plans. For the most, these plans have a long way to go from the drawing board to actual operations due to the technical, economic, legal and societal challenges ahead. In this article we review the status and possibilities of CCS in Netherlands based on an analysis of existing literature in the relevant disciplines. First, a brief overview of the technology options for carbon capture and storage or utilization is given. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the governmental support for CCS, given the vital role that fit-for-purpose legal frameworks and policy instruments will play in CCS deployment. Technical, legal and policy uncertainties translates into factors inhibiting CCS investment and so the paper then presents a CCS investment project to illustrate how such risks affect the business case for CCS. Finally, bearing in mind that societal acceptance has proved to be a major barrier for CCS, both in Netherlands and elsewhere, the conditions that enhance public acceptance of CCS are examined. Our work shows that while CCS is technically a straightforward proposition, its deployment has historically been hindered by the lack of a sound business case and a compelling and stable socio-technical narrative. The main argument in favor of CCS today is that it offers a transition pathway for rapidly and massively reducing CO2 emissions beyond what could be accomplished by alternative methods like electrification and renewable fuels in near future. The introduction of new financial instruments, increased government support and an improvement in social engagement appear to have enhanced the prospects of CCS in Netherlands, but we feel it is premature to assume that this time everything is different.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "8f44f8c5e8f81cd7ebe1cff36dae2e522d5057ae", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2055113005", "DOI": "10.6110/KJACR.2011.23.12.769", "CorpusId": 97089278}, "title": "A Comparative Study on the Effect of THF and Oxidized Carbon Nanotubes for Methane Hydrate Formation", "abstract": "ABSTRACT:Methane hydrate is formed by physical binding between water molecules and methane gas, which is captured in the cavities of water molecules under the specific temperature and pressure. 1 m 3 hydrate of pure methane can be decomposed to the methane gas of 172 m 3 and water of 0.8 m 3 at standard condition.

The results show that when the oxidized carbon nanofluids of 0.03 wt% was, the amount of gas consumed during the formation of methane hydrate was higher than that in the THF aqueous solution. Also, the oxidized carbon nanofluids decreased the hydrate formation time to a greater extent than the THF aqueous solution at the same subcooling tempera-ture.Keywords:Methane hydrate(\uba54\ud0c4 \ud558\uc774\ub4dc\ub808\uc774\ud2b8), Tetrahydrofuran(THF), Oxidized carbon nanofluids(\uc0b0\ud654\ud0c4\uc18c\ub098\ub178\uc720\uccb4), Formation(\uc0dd\uc131), Subcooling(\uacfc\ub0c9\ub3c4)", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "db5ecb974cb6c236d6ac5f65576bfb1aeca55171", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2591941093", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-52311-8_12", "CorpusId": 210082053}, "title": "Waste-to-Energy", "abstract": "This chapter shows that municipal and other waste forms make a significant contribution to GHG emissions and have an adverse impact on other environmental factors (e.g., health, water quality, air, etc.) in those regions where waste management systems are rudimentary or non-existent. Waste-to-energy provides a very limited amount of electricity or heat on a global basis and has virtually no contribution in either Africa or Latin America. There is a wide variety of Municipal solid waste (MSW) production rates between countries in Africa related to GDP per capita, and variations in national policies. In Latin America the average values of MSW production rates are significantly higher but are less related to GDP per capita than other socio-economic factors that are difficult to identify. Landfill gas and biogas projects are increasing in frequency within Africa and Latin America. For small communities, biogas digesters using animal and human manure could provide cooking solutions while also providing supplementary benefits to sewage treatment. A number of programmes are in place in Africa to increase the use of biogas in domestic applications. Therefore, instead of carbon capture and storage in landfills, which generally occurs at the beginning of the resource flows, the principle of carbon capture, transformation and reuse adding waste-to-energy paths in the cycle could be further developed and applied throughout the whole socio-industrial metabolism.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "b08c2720449bcd32f005386c28cfd36f5d712af5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3196422614", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2021.103438", "CorpusId": 239710856}, "title": "An investigation on the solvent based carbon capture and storage system by process modeling and comparisons with another carbon control methods for different ships", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "6cfe6bfd362824dfad0e2258a5ab30d1c2b98669", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2940784473", "DOI": "10.1017/9781316480724.002", "CorpusId": 149699222}, "title": "Climate Change and the Role of Carbon Capture and Storage in Mitigation", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "020df1cfb146ad4bd9db10e80e09cb4dabf76f61", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2219982133", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.1424402", "CorpusId": 155482147}, "title": "Generation Portfolio and Investment Timing Until 2030: A Real Options Approach for Germany", "abstract": "Political restraints and proceeding effects of global warming cause the need for a change in electricity generation in Europe and its member states.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the German power plant portfolio until 2030 taking into account investment flexibility. The analysis is based on the real options approach. Results show that total capacity investments compensate phased-out generation capacity over time and that the share of renewables in the future generation portfolio slightly increases.

Using data from a novel large-scale survey, we analyse the determinants of acceptance of these measures in Germany. We also provide experimental evidence on how additional information on these measures changes the respondents' acceptance. We show that the acceptance differs strongly between the three measures. Afforestation is strongly favoured over CCS-S and SSI. This ranking holds independent of the amount of information provided.

Various power systems based on high-temperature fuel cells have been proposed, especially hybrid systems combining a fuel cell with a gas turbine, and research on carbon capture and storage technology to prevent the emission of greenhouse gases is already underway. This study suggests a new method to innovatively enhance the efficiency of a molten carbonate fuel cell/micro gas turbine hybrid system including carbon capture. The key technology adopted to improve the net cycle efficiency is off-gas recirculation. The hybrid system incorporating oxy-combustion capture was devised, and its performance was compared with that of a post-combustion system based on a hybrid system. A molten carbonate fuel cell system based on a commercial unit was modeled. Externally supplied water for reforming was not needed as a result of the presence of the water vapor in the recirculated anode off-gas. The analyses confirmed that the thermal efficiencies of all the systems (MCFC stand-alone, hybrid, hybrid with oxy-combustion capture, hybrid with post-combustion capture) were significantly improved by introducing the off-gas recirculation. In particular, the largest efficiency improvement was observed for the oxy-combustion hybrid system. Its efficiency is over 57% and is even higher than that of the post-combustion hybrid system.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "f55278df7005c117f5ceb89b956e82e762e8e9d9", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "7793669", "DOI": "10.3389/fpls.2020.591297", "CorpusId": 229333429, "PubMed": "33424886"}, "title": "Oxalate Carbonate Pathway\u2014Conversion and Fixation of Soil Carbon\u2014A Potential Scenario for Sustainability", "abstract": "It is still an important aspect of global climate research to explore a low-cost method that can effectively reduce the increase of CO2 concentration in the global atmosphere. Oxalotrophic bacterial communities exist in agricultural or forest soil with ubiquitous oxalate as the only carbon and energy source. When soil oxalate is oxidized and degraded, carbonate is formed along with it. This process is called the oxalate carbonate pathway (OCP), which can increase soil inorganic carbon sink and soil organic matter content. This soil carbon sink is a natural CO2 trapping system and an important alternative if it is properly managed for artificial sequestration/storage. As the main driver of OCP, the oxalate degrading bacteria are affected by many factors during the oxalate conversion process. Understanding this process and the synergy of oxalogenic plants, saprophytic decomposers, and oxalotrophic bacteria in agricultural or forest soil is critical to exploiting this natural carbon capture process.

For example, one can alter performance in applications like carbon capture or methane storage by orders of magnitude by only modifying the pore structure (1,2). For these applications it is therefore important to identify the optimal pore geometry and use this information to find similar materials. However, the mathematical language and tools to identify materials with similar pore structures, but different composition, has been lacking. Here we develop a pore recognition approach to quantify similarity of pore structures and classify them using topological data analysis (3,4). Our approach allows us to identify materials with similar pore geometries, and to screen for materials that are similar to given top-performing structures. Using methane storage as a case study, we also show that materials can be divided into topologically distinct classes -- and that each class requires different optimization strategies.

The assessment identified 14 metals for which the deployment of the six technologies will require 1% or more (and in some cases, much more) of current world supply per annum between 2020 and 2030. Following a more critical examination, based on the likelihood of rapid future global demand growth, limitations to expanding supply in the short to medium term, and the concentration of supply and political risks associated with key suppliers, 5 of the 14 metals were pinpointed to be at high risk, namely: the rare earth metals neodymium and dysprosium (for wind technology), and the by-products (from the processing of other metals) indium, tellurium and gallium (for photovoltaic technologies).

For the carbon dioxide flooding process, the crude oil displacement generally shows a better performance with the increase of the pressure. However, carbon disposal is always complex. It could encounter organic solid phase precipitation and deposition in near miscibility environment. The law of multiphase and multicomponent diversification in the whole processes is still poorly understood. We thus used the method of slim tube to get dynamic data during the process. Indeed, the interval of near minimum miscibility pressure was determined. Analysis results of injectivity index and productivity index show that the reservoir blockage primarily appears as the displacement pressure is higher than the near minimum miscibility lower limit pressure and plays an important role in the production capacity.

We conducted a twelve-month study on ants in the Sabangau TPSF in Indonesian Borneo using baited traps, to compare community composition across three disturbance categories (forest gaps, forest edge and relatively undisturbed interior forest) and between dry and wet season. The three disturbance categories supported distinct ant communities across seasons. Differences in canopy cover likely underlie these changes in ant community composition. Surveying was more effective in the dry season, because ant capture rates were higher and more indicator taxa were identified than in the wet season, but overall ant community composition did not differ significantly between seasons. These findings suggest a potentially useful role of ants as ecological indicators in TPSF.
