The research investigates the technical, economic, and environmental performances of three biofuel production routes, namely Fischer\u2013Tropsch synthesis (FTS), bio-synthetic natural gas (bioSNG) and oxymethylene ethers (OMEx) synthesis using flowsheets developed in Aspen Plus. It constitutes the first attempt to holistically evaluate both the techno-economic performance and the environmental benefits of employing BECCS in fuel generation. For an input of 1020 dry tonnes per day of woody biomass, the FTS route yields 275 t d\u22121, the bioSNG route yields 238 t d\u22121 and the OMEx route yields 635 t d\u22121 of fuel and the energy efficiency is in the range of 44.9% to59.7% without CCS and 44.0% to 58.2% with CCS.

In 2015, the shares of electricity generation generated from coal, hydro, oil and biomass were 48.1%, 47.40%, 3.65% and 0.85%, respectively. The government of Cambodia has set up the Power Development Plan (PDP) 2020 which mainly emphasizes the development of renewable energy and coal-based power. The drastically increasing share of coal-based electricity generation in the recent years is providing an alarming signal in terms of the increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the power sector. Recently, renewable energy and efficient technologies have played an important role in GHG emission\u2019s reduction. The aim of this paper is to quantify the potentials of renewable energy and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) mitigation options in the power sector of Cambodia. In this study, the Long-range Energy Planning (LEAP) model is used to analyze the electricity generation mix and CO 2 mitigation during 2015 to 2050. The BAU scenario is constructed in this study following the power development targets of PDP2020, and the share of renewable energy-based power generation is assumed to reach 44% by 2050. Three countermeasure (CM) scenarios of CO 2 mitigation (namely, CM1, CM2, and CM3) are modeled along with the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario. Two countermeasure scenarios, namely CM1 and CM2 considering an additional 5% of power generation based on solar PV and biomass-based technologies have been constructed in this study respectively. In the CM3 scenario, the CO 2 mitigation effects of replacing 50% of conventional coal-fired power plants with the efficient carbon capture storage (CCS) technology in coal power plants have been analyzed. The results demonstrate that in the BAU scenario, electricity supply and CO 2 emissions from the power sector will increase to 65.9TWh and 14,683.5kt-CO 2eq , respectively, in 2050.

CCS typically involves injection of supercritical CO2 into abandoned oil and gas reservoirs or saline aquifers with sufficient porosity and permeability. CO2 is trapped by a number of mechanisms which differ in security with storage in carbonate minerals (geological carbon storage) being the most secure long term mechanism. Consequently, it is important to understand the behaviour of reactive flows and what influences the mineralisation process to occur so that the CCS process can be optimised as a tool for reducing the greenhouse effect. \nIn this work, we present a novel methodology based on 3D models of connected pore structures extracted from micro computed tomography (microCT). The pore geometry is used to build a representative volume in which fluid flow and mineral precipitation takes place. We numerically solve the governing equations of coupled advection-diffusion-reaction using Finite Element Discretisation. The performed simulations describe advection and diffusion of an injected CO2 brine as well as reaction of this fluid phase with the pore walls to form carbonate minerals.

Since the parameters in the Pitzer equations are unknown for some species involved in the equilibrium, new expressions that correlate the virial parameters in the Pitzer equations with the ionic radii and charges of the species are derived. Further, since some ionic radii are unavailable in the literature, new expressions are derived to estimate these unknown ionic radii. Furthermore, a case study involving MEA, DEA and NH3 is investigated using the expressions that correlate the parameters in the Pitzer equations with the ionic radii and charges. Finally, a mineral carbonation process involving NH3 as the chemical solvent is simulated in Aspen Plus, and this process aims to investigate the precipitation of calcium carbonate using the fly ash generated in power plants. \nAs a conclusion, the calculated activity and osmotic coefficients of the aqueous species obtained using the equations that correlate the virial coefficients in the Pitzer equations with the ionic radii and charges are in good agreement with the experimental data from the literature up to a temperature 150 \u00b0C. Likewise, the expressions derived to estimate the unknown ionic radii produces results that are in good agreement with the literature data. Furthermore, the case study involving MEA, DEA and NH3 shows that the correlating equations accurately predict speciation and partial pressures up to a solvent mass fraction of about 20%. Finally, a comprehensive analysis involving the conversion of the pure CO2 produced in the amine capture plants into a solid is presented, and as a result this new process is capable not only of reducing the electricity consumption of the MEA capture plant by about 18%, but also to produce a product that may be potentially reutilized in industry, namely the PCC.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "413b471e3f777540302cd8273ab503336035ec3d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "631724750", "CorpusId": 135607425}, "title": "Carbon Nanotubes Deposited by Hot Wire Plasma CVD and water assisted CVD for Energetic and Environmental Applications", "abstract": "Nanoscience and Nanotechnology have experienced a tremendous growth in few years. Nanotechnologies are the design, characterization, production and application of structures, devices and systems by controlling shape and size at nanometer scale. Carbon exists in several forms, depending on how the carbon atoms are arranged, their properties vary. One of the carbon forms is carbon nanotubes, which are capped at each end by half of a fullerene, and have aroused great interest in the research community because of their exotic electrical, thermal and mechanical properties. MWCNTs and SWCNTs were discovered in 1991 and 1993, respectively, by Ijima. A single-wall carbon nanotube can be described as a graphene sheet rolled into a cylindrical shape so that the structure has one-dimensional axial symmetry. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have unique characteristics that allow them to act as electrodes in charge storage devices, sensors and traps for pollutants, among others. On the one hand, for applications that require a certain amount of energy in pulse form, the traditional capacitors used in electronic circuits are not suitable because they cannot store enough energy in the volume and weight available. However, given the characteristics of CNTs that have a narrow size distribution, large specific surface area, low resistivity and high stability, CNTs have been regarded as a suitable material for electrodes in supercapacitors. On the other hand, the development of new systems, based in CNTs, which could overcome some of the current limitations in the capture of emerging pollutants in fluids, such as nanometric particles (being, moreover, difficult to detect) and organic pollutants at very low concentrations, is an additional objective of the present thesis. Water plasma and nitrogen plasma treatments were performed to remove amorphous carbon and to functionalize the surface of CNTs with different oxygen or nitrogen groups. Conditions of plasma treatments were optimized by adopting a Box-Wilson experimental design. Various microscopic and spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize the morphology, structure and elemental compositions before and after the plasma treatments. Electrochemical measurements show that water plasma treatment significantly increases the active surface area of CNTs, and nitrogen plasma is more effective to improve the charge transfer. Both nitrogen and water plasma raise the capacitance of CNTs notably in comparison to untreated CNTs. Manganese dioxide was deposited by galvanostatic method on untreated CNTs and plasma treated nanotubes. The MnO2 structure changes from nanoflower (as deposited) to needle like or to a layer coating on the surface of CNTs depending on the voltage applied during the cycling measurements. CNTs treated with 75 W plasma power and 10 Pa nitrogen pressure, and further functionalized with MnO2, exhibit the highest specific capacitance obtained in this thesis; 955 Fg-1 at 10 mVs-1. This value is almost 87% of the theoretical value for MnO2. The structural evolution of CNTs during water assisted growth has also been studied. The obtained length of CNTs was ~ 800 \u00b5m on silicon wafer. Transfer of ultralong CNTs on conductive adhesive aluminum tape was carried out using a novel methodology that lowers the series resistance of the electrode. The specific capacitance of CNTs/Al increases from 87 to 148 Fg-1 for untreated and water plasma treated CNTs/Al, respectively. In addition, we found that for a successful and faster growth of CNTs on copper substrate, strong adhesion of the buffer layer (Al2O3) is essential. A multilayered setup (Cu/Ni/Ti/Al2O3) prior to catalyst deposition boosts the growth rate and quality of CNTs. Vertically-aligned CNTs were synthesized on quartz fiber filters for environmental applications. Three chlorinated VOCs; trichloroethylene, chloroform and 1,2-dichlorobenzene were used to study the adsorption/desorption properties of CNTs/QF. The ability to detect or remove organic pollutants increases after the water plasma treatment, which functionalizes the CNTs surface and removes the catalyst from the top of CNTs (inner cavities are available for use). We found that molecules with aromatic rings present stronger interactions with CNTs (Phi-stacking).", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "5487d21ac542ecd1412f3ba62c6e00d2b1129050", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s12667-017-0242-z", "CorpusId": 195250412}, "title": "The impact of policy measures on future power generation portfolio and infrastructure: a combined electricity and CCTS investment and dispatch model (ELCO)", "abstract": "This paper presents a general electricity-CO$$_{2}$$2 modeling framework that is able to simulate interactions of the energy-only market with different forms of national policy measures.

This thesis addresses both large-scale wind integration (Papers 1\u20133) and development of new energy technologies (Paper 4) in service of this goal. Compressed air energy storage (CAES) could be paired with a wind farm to provide firm, dispatchable baseload power, or serve as a peaking plant and capture upswings in electricity prices. Paper 1 presents a firm-level engineering-economic analysis of a wind/CAES system with a wind farm in central Texas, load in either Dallas or Houston, and a CAES plant whose location is profit-optimized. Of a range of market scenarios considered, the CAES plant is found to be profitable only given the existence of large and infrequent price spikes. Social benefits of wind/CAES include avoided construction of new generation capacity, improved air quality during peak demand, and increased economic surplus, but may not outweigh the private cost of the CAES system nor justify a subsidy. Like CAES, pumped hydropower storage (PHS) ramps quickly enough to smooth wind power and could profit from arbitrage on short-term price fluctuations exacerbated by large-scale wind. Germany has aggressive plans for wind power expansion, and Paper 2 analyzes an investment opportunity in a PHS facility in Norway that practices arbitrage in the German spot market. Price forecasts given increased wind capacity are used to calculate profit-maximizing production schedules and annual revenue streams.

In Chapter 1 the editors briefly present the scale of the (CO2) abatement required at a global level and the potential role of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), within that context the remainder of this book focuses on the UK scale. In Chapter 2 entitled \u2018\u2018Underground Storage of Carbon Dioxide\u2019\u2019 the concept of geological storage covering issues such as storage site identification, characterization and selection, storage capacity, long term monitoring and verification of storage, storage safety and security and the integrity of wells in the UK context have been reviewed. In Chapter 3 (Engineering Feasibility of Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage) the costs and effectiveness of capture and recovery of CO2 for a range of known technologies (such as physical and chemical absorption and adsorption, gas separation membrane technology, flue gas recycling/ oxyfuel boilers) have been reviewed. This chapter also presents some more novel routes to CO2 capture and utilization that are currently less well developed. In Chapter 4 (Geological Carbon Dioxide Storage and the Law) existing legal regimes at international European Community and national levels, identifying problem areas and areas for proposed change have been examined. Issues addressed include where and when these various Conventions apply, the legality of CO2 storage as an option, requirements for permits or licences and liability. Chapter 5 (The Public Perception of Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage in the UK) assesses public perception associated with the options for CCS in the UK. Chapters 6 (A Regional Integrated Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage: North West of England Case Study) and 7 (A Regional Integrated Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage: East Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside Case Study) present the results from the two case study regions. The case studies incorporate a geological review of the suitability and potential of possible storage reservoirs in the region, a set of scenarios exploring alternative power generation pathways for each region and a Stakeholder Multi-Criteria Assessment (MCA) of these scenarios.

In the recent years, global concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is increasing rapidly. CO2 emissions have an impact on global climate change. Anthropogenic CO2 is emitted primarily from fossil fuel combustion. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one option for reducing CO2 emissions. There are three major approaches for CCS: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture and oxyfuel process. Post-combustion capture offers some advantages as existing combustion technologies can still be used without radical changes on them. There are several post combustion gas separation and capture technologies being investigated, namely; (a) absorption, (b) cryogenic separation, (c) membrane separation (d) micro algal biofixation and (e) adsorption. Apart from establishing new techniques, the exploration of capture materials with high separation performance and low capital cost are paramount importance. However, the application of adsorption from either technology, require easily regenerable and durable adsorbents with a high CO2 adsorption capacity. It has recently been reported that the cost of the CO2 capture can be reduced by using this technology. In this paper, the research progress (from experimental results) in adsorbents for CO2 adsorption, storage, and separations were reviewed and future research directions were suggested as well.

Russia is one of the largest emitters and Estonia has one of the highest CO2 emissions per capita in the world. Russia has not ratified yet Paris Climate Agreement.

Estonian burnt oil shale could be used as an effective sorbent in the proposed CO2-mineralization process, binding up to 0.18 kg CO2 per kg of waste. The onshore CCUS scenario was proposed for CO2 emissions produced and captured by Kunda Nordic Cement plant (KNC), Eesti and Balti power plants, and Latvenergo TEC-2, the largest CO2 emitters in Estonia and Latvia.

Among the technologies today available for CO2 capture, calcium looping exploits the reaction that takes place at medium temperatures between lime (CaO) and CO2 to form limestone (CaCO3) which can be reversed at higher temperatures to release pure CO2. The process is based on well-known technology but its application for CO2 capture has been suggested only recently and is less established than other CO2 capture technologies such as chemical absorption using amines or ammonia as solvents. A reason for this is that fuel is needed to provide high temperature heat. Thus carbon capture by calcium looping can represent a competitive solution where fuel is available in large quantities like in coal power plants. In addition, since a certain quantity of spent sorbent is obtained from the calcium looping, an interesting application arises when this spent lime can be further used for other purposes. This is the case of the cement industry where lime from the calcium looping can reduce the demand of fresh limestone and the energy consumption for its calcination into lime. The aim of this thesis is to investigate the process integration opportunities of carbon capture by the calcium looping technology mainly from a thermodynamic point of view and for the two most relevant application cases: coal power plant and cement industry. Pinch analysis is used as a tool for estimating the consequences of calcium looping application on the process heat and power balances under ideal heat recovery conditions. For this purpose, process modelling and simulation is conducted to obtain temperature and heat load information of the different system parts. \n \nThe work is organised in two parts discussing the integration aspects of calcium looping with a state of the art coal power plant and a combined power and cement production plant respectively. Three configurations are considered for integration of calcium looping with the coal power plant: two cases assuming a separate steam cycle to recover the excess heat from the calcium looping process (each case with different complexity of the steam cycle) and one case where heat from the coal plant and calcium looping process are recovered and used in the same steam cycle. To assess the integration effect of carbon capture the penalty on the power plant thermal efficiency is used as an indicator. For comparison oxy-fuel coal combustion technology and subsequent CO2 separation by water condensation is also investigated. The case where calcium looping and the coal power plant are integrated with the same steam cycle achieves the best result in terms of electrical efficiency, with a penalty of 5.3%-points compared to a reference coal plant without calcium looping (from 42.8% to 37.5%). The analysis of integration between coal power plant, cement production plant and calcium looping is conducted considering two cases: the first where the cement plant output is kept equal to the reference plant, and the second where the cement output is adjusted to completely replace the limestone input with the spent sorbent from the calcium looping. The integration effects are assessed considering different indicators, such as the thermal efficiency penalty with respect the reference power plant, the specific fuel consumption for cement production, the reduction in specific GHG-emissions from the combined cement and power production. In the case of limestone free cement production the further integration of cement production with coal power plant and calcium looping contributes to a minor reduction in thermal efficiency (from 37.5% to 37.3%).", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "63ef13cc91bf241081af007c357fe5da09a76913", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1755266000", "DOI": "10.11606/D.85.2007.TDE-27112007-141320", "CorpusId": 166441745}, "title": "Restaura\u00e7\u00e3o de mata ciliar pela viabiliza\u00e7\u00e3o de cr\u00e9dito de carbono: uma proposta s\u00f3cio-ambiental para comunidade de baixa renda", "abstract": "Due to intensification in climate changes by antropogenic causes, to the recognition of the environmental importance of the Gallery Forest and its intense degradation, this work presents an analysis of the possibilities of carbon credit attainment by low-income community, as part of an incentive program for the restoration of these areas.

Many individuals would be interested in saving energy (and thus also carbon dioxide as well as money), but they lack information on their consumption. Indeed, feedback on household electricity usage is typically only provided by monthly (or even annual) utility bills and therefore remains opaque to most households. Few people know how much electricity they consume, and even fewer have any idea how much electricity they use for a particular purpose (eg lighting). And even those who do have a fair understanding of their consumption patterns rarely receive guidance about the changes that would have the biggest impact on their electricity bills. Fortunately, emerging \" smart \" information and communication technologies can help to make electricity consumption visible to individuals [1]. For instance, next-generation digital electricity meters (\" smart meters \") enable detailed electricity consumption information to be captured, processed, and communicated at frequent intervals (eg once per second). As smart meters are replacing traditional electricity meters in large parts of Europe, there is now a unique opportunity to realize comprehensive consumer feedback systems that consist of much more than mere remote metering applications. At ETH Zurich we seized the opportunity offered by this development. Within the eMeter project we connected smart meters to smartphones [2]. As they are almost always connected to the Internet and within reach of the user, using smartphones to visualize electricity consumption eliminates the need for costly in-house displays. The resulting system not only fits unobtrusively into the home environment, but also provides fine-grained electricity consumption information in real-time, enabling occupants to better understand their electricity consumption. The sensing and feedback system we developed consists of three loosely coupled components that are responsible for data acquisition, data handling, and data visualization. The first component consists of a state-of-the-art smart electricity meter that monitors the total household load. We extended the meter's functionality by incorporating a gateway module implemented on an embedded computing device equipped with flash storage and a WiFi communication module. This matchbox-sized gateway module also holds the second component of our system, a web server with a database.

As the body of scientific knowledge on the physics and chemistry of coal combustion grew, it was used to direct the improvements to efficiency required and, later, the control of pollutants produced during the combustion of coal. This involves not only the control of emissions of particulates, SOx and oxides of nitrogen but also of trace elements, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and, increasingly, CO2.

The Devonian black shales serve as both the source and trap for large quantities of natural gas; total gas in place for the shales in Kentucky is estimated to be between 63 and 112 trillion cubic feet. Most of this natural gas is adsorbed on clay and kerogen surfaces, analogous to the way methane is stored in coal beds.

This widespread production results in significant anthropogenic environmental impacts, the awareness of which has spurred advances in material development to lower these burdens. However, proposed changes are often not assessed in the context of the data variability and uncertainty inherent in the environmental impact quantification methods employed. As such, the probability that any suggested strategy will result in a desired effect is not addressed. This work aims to quantitatively examine data variability, an inherent characteristic of elements in supply chains, and data uncertainty, a function of data quality for the system being modeled, in assessments of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions from concrete production. Data variability is determined through ranges in requisite input values from the literature; data uncertainty is assessed through application of an established pedigree matrix method. Statistical analysis of the emissions from concrete production incorporating sources of variability and uncertainty are examined through Monte Carlo simulations. Concrete mixtures, representing a feasible structural concrete for use in California infrastructure and three alternative mixtures are assessed, as are three GHG emissions mitigation strategies, namely, a change in thermal energy fuel mix, a change in electricity grid, and use of carbon capture and storage. The distributions of emissions derived through statistical analyses are used to examine the probability of efficacy of these strategies, as well as potential co-benefits on air emissions. Results show each constituent change and each mitigation strategy considered would lead to a reduction in GHG emissions if only mean values are compared; however, the probability of these reductions varies.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a potentially important technology for the mitigation of industrial CO2 emissions, however the majority of the subsurface storage capacity is in geological strata for which there is relatively little information, the so-called saline aquifers. Published estimates of the potential storage capacity of such formations, based on limited data, often give no indication of the uncertainty, despite there being substantial uncertainty associated with the data used to calculate such estimates. Using only publicly available data, a group of experts independently estimated the storage capacity of 7 regional saline aquifers. The experts produced a wide range of estimates for each aquifer due a combination of using different published values for some variables and differences in their judgements of the aquifer properties such as area and thickness. The range of storage estimates produced by the experts shows that there is significant uncertainty in such estimates, in particular the experts' range does not capture the highest possible capacity estimates, meaning that by not accounting for uncertainty, such regional estimates may underestimate the true storage capacity.

We focus on two particular issues; the carbon efficiency and payback time of bioenergy use in BECCS and the potential constraints on the supply of bioenergy. The simplistic vision of BECCS is that one ton of CO2 captured in the growth of biomass equates to one ton of CO2 sequestered geologically, but this cannot be the case as CO2 is emitted by variable amounts during the life cycle from crop establishment to sequestration below ground in geological formations. The deployment of BECCS is ultimately reliant on the availability of sufficient, sustainably sourced, biomass. The two most important factors determining this supply are land availability and land productivity. The upper bounds of the area estimates required correspond to more than the world's harvested land for cereal production. To achieve these estimates of biomass availability requires the rapid evolution of a multitude of technological, social, political, and economic factors.

Accompanying the economic and societal benefits of this period was the recognition of the damage resulting from smog owing to excessive burning of coal, which affected both human health and the natural environment. These pivotal centuries laid the foundation for the advancement of scientific knowledge and discovery which underpinned both engineering developments and the sciences of the natural world, including earth science, atmospheric science, and meteorology.

Conveniently, forests and woodlands are important sinks of carbon through sequestration which involves carbon dioxide capture and storage. Miombo woodlands are the most widespread savanna vegetation in the Sub-Saharan Africa, and like other vegetation they are likely to have a marked degree of carbon sequestration.

Env. Sci. 2017 26 | Mganga et al. Introduction The western part of Tanzania is dominated by miombo woodlands. Miombo is a word which is used by ecologists to describe woodland ecosystems dominated by trees of the genera Brachystegia, Julbernadia and Isoberlinia of the family Leguminosae, subfamily Caesalpinioideae (Desanker et al., 1995). Like other vegetation, miombo woodlands are very useful in environmental conservation specifically carbon sequestration (Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT), 1989). Carbon sequestration is the process of removing carbon from the atmosphere and depositing it in a reservoir such woodlands and forests, and soils (Magdoff et al., 1996). Miombo woodlands have carbon densities ranging between 15 and 100 t C ha-1 in woody biomass (Frost, 1996). In Mozambique, Grace et al. (2007) reported carbon storage of 26 t ha1 in standing biomass of miombo woodlands. The Eastern Arc miombo woodlands of Tanzania have been reported to have carbon storage potential between 25 and 80 t C ha-1 (Shirima, 2009). Furthermore, Munishi et al. (2010) reported carbon stock averaging 19.2 t C ha-1 in miombo woodlands of the southern highlands of Mbeya Region. Despite the usefulness of miombo woodlands, their survival is mainly threatened by disturbances such as fire, deforestation, charcoal extraction and agriculture (Chidumayo and Gumbo, 2010). Of these factors, fire is the major determinant of carbon stock (Chidumayo, 2002). Fire frequency is the component of fire regime which influences many ecological processes (Sugihara et al., 2006). Miombo woodlands account for more than half of the global area burned annually (Mouillot and Field, 2005) with a frequency of 2 to 4 years (Mouillot et al., 2005). This burning leads to more release of carbon into the atmosphere than the amount used by vegetation during photosynthesis (Brown, 2002). For example, wildfires emit 2\u20133 Petagram (Pg) (1 Pg = 984206527.6111 tonne) of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere from 3\u20134 million km2 of the globe each year (Giglio et al., 2006). Basically the western part of Tanzania is among the highly ranked national-wise in terms of high fire frequencies in the period between 2000 and 2010 (National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), 2010). Yet, varied findings on how fires influence carbon stock in forests and woodlands have been reported. In the United States of America, a study conducted on oaks of the Black Rock Forest showed that more carbon was stored in unburnt plots than in burned plots (Pe\u00f1afort, 2001). In miombo woodland of Mozambique and Zimbabwe 2 Mg of C ha-1 were reported in woody plants that were subjected to high fire intensity, while under low fire intensity the stock of carbon was 65 Mg ha-1 (Ryan and Williams, 2011). Furthermore, in Indonesia biomass loss of 14, 889,411.07 tonnes by wildfires emitted 7,150,234.98 megagram (Mg) of carbon (Murdiyarso et al., 2002). On the other hand, in Australia intense frequent fires increased carbon storage in forest plantations through enhancement of regeneration by sprouting, seeding and prevention of competition with the ground flora (Forestry Tasmania, 2010). Also, forest fires are known to increase soil nitrogen, microbial biomass and temperature thereby promoting the growth of plants (Kimmins, 1996; DeLuca and Zouhar, 2000). Some miombo species are well adapted to frequent fires, hence likely to have enhanced carbon sequestration. This is because some plant species in miombo woodlands have protected meristems, below-ground reproductive organs and seeds that can survive fire in which heat/or smoke triggers maturation and germination by breaking the hard-seed coat dormancy (Bond and Midgley, 2003). Despite these findings, there is limited information on the impacts of frequent disturbances from annual bushfires which is needed to develop relevant management actions (Williams et al., 2008). It follows therefore that the aim of the present study was to determine tree carbon in Ilunde forest after consecutive exposure to frequent fires for 10 years. J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2017 27 | Mganga et al. Material and methods The Study area The present study was confined to frequently burnt miombo woodland of Ilunde, which is located between latitudes 5o 00 and 6o 00 S, and longitudes 30o 00 and 31o 00 E. On the other hand, fire suppressed miombo woodland of Kitwe located between latitudes 4o 54' and 4o 55' S, and longitudes 29o 36' and 29o 37' E was used as a control (Figures 1 and 2). Kitwe forest has been protected from fires by the collaborative initiatives of the United Republic of Tanzania (URT), Hardwood Forest Fund and United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for about ten years ago. Sampling of trees In each of the two forests namely; Ilunde and Kitwe, 30 circular concentric plots were established. Systematic random sampling was used and this was to ensure that the population is evenly sampled. The sampling intensities for Ilunde and Kitwe forests were 0.03% and 2.4%, respectively. Financial status, time limitation and purpose of the forest inventory may necessitate the sampling intensity to be as low as 0.01% (Malimbwi and Mugasha, 2002; Malimbwi et al., 2005). In each forest, the distance between the concentric plots was 100 m. Radius with 15 m was used to sample trees with DBH \u2265 20cm, radius with 10 m was used to sample trees with DBH \u2265 10 cm but less than 20 cm and radius with 5 m was used to sample trees with DBH \u2265 5 cm but less than 10 cm (Vesa et al., 2010). In the present study, a tree is defined as a woody species with diameter at breast height (DBH) of \u2265 5 cm as adopted from studies that were carried out in miombo woodlands of the Eastern Arc Mountains by Chamshama et al. (2004); Zahabu (2008), and in Mozambique by Ryan and Williams (2011). DBH of trees were measured using diameter calipers. Estimation of carbon stock The above-ground biomass of all live trees was calculated from the following biomass allometric model developed for plant species in miombo woodlands: Ln W = -1.002937 + 1.382159 \u00d7 ln DBH + 0.640364 \u00d7 ln H (Stromgaard, 1986) Where: Ln = natural logarithm W = biomass (kg/tree) DBH = diameter at breast height (m) H = total tree height (m) The model was chosen because it was developed to be used in the Zambezian miombo woodlands within the DBH range of 5 cm and above. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Zambezian_ Miombo_woodlands). Tree biomass was assumed to be 50% carbon (Munishi and Shear, 2004), which was estimated as carbon sequestered in tonnes/hectare. Fire frequency in Ilunde forest Wildfire frequencies accumulated for about ten years in Ilunde forest are presented in Figure 3. The average number of wildfires per annum was 35 (Mganga and Lyaruu, 2016). Statistical analysis The effect of fire frequency carbon sequestration was assessed by comparing the stock of tree carbon in the two forests using paired t-test (Motulsky, 1998), as recommended by Pardini et al. (2004); Zhao et al. (2012). Results and discussion In the present study, the mean tree carbon stock of 6.06 \u00b1 0.42 t haand 14.08 \u00b1 0.99 t hawas recorded in Ilunde and Kitwe forests respectively (Figure 4). Tree carbon stock was significantly higher in the control (Kitwe) than in Ilunde forest (P < 0.05, t = 10.3, DF = 102). Enormous biomass in Kitwe forest possibly resulted from enhanced sprouting of saplings into trees after fire suppression. According to Knox and Clarke (2005), some resprouting species store extra energy in their roots to aid recovery and regrowths after disturbance. However, in the present study the values of forest carbon are lower than that have been reported in other miombo woodlands, for example, by Grace et al. (2007), Shirima (2009) and Munishi et al. (2010). J. Bio. Env. Sci. 2017 28 | Mganga et al. The difference in the stock of forest carbon could be attributed to high degree of disturbance particularly wildfires and illegal tree cutting in the study area. Also, it is likely that only little time had passed since fire suppression in Kitwe forest to allow massive woody carbon accum", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "26e3e5fc09a867fd2477bccacb424c8647ec44de", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2788489321", "CorpusId": 134436785}, "title": "Cost-effective, near-term deployment of carbon capture and storage from biorefineries in the United States", "abstract": "Capture and permanent sequestration of biogenic CO2 emissions play a pivotal role in stringent climate change mitigation. Bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) technologies, in particular, can remove atmospheric CO2 emissions while producing valuable energy products such as fuels, electricity, and gaseous hydrocarbons. Yet, most near-term assessments of climate change mitigation opportunities assume BECCS is either too costly or commercially unavailable. In contrast, biogenic CO2 capture and sequestration from industrial fermentation is already deployed at commercial scale, including several corn ethanol facilities in the United States. Such capture opportunities target pure streams of biogenic CO2 from existing biofuel infrastructure, resulting in a low cost of capture and sequestration. Moreover, existing and proposed policies in the United States, including California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) and the 2016 Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Act (S.3179, the CCUS Act), could provide sufficient financial incentive for industry-wide deployment of CCS for saline aquifers. Here, we study the abatement potential and costs of biogenic CO2 capture and sequestration from biorefineries in the United States using process engineering, spatial optimization, and lifecycle assessment. We minimize the total cost of capture, compression, transportation, and sequestration, building from existing spatial pipeline optimization models [1]. We consider two options for CO2 transport: pipelines, and trucking, which recent work has shown is cost-effective at low CO2 volumes [2]. Preliminary results identify ~44 Mt of biogenic CO2 emitted annually from 217 facilities, most of which can be captured for under $30/tCO2. We also find strong evidence for economies of scale in pipeline transportation. Recent financial incentives under California\u2019s LCFS (~$75150/tCO2 abated) and proposed in the U.S Senate ($50/tCO2 stored in saline aquifers) suggest a substantial near-term opportunity to permanently sequester biogenic CO2, given proper policy incentives. This opportunity can catalyze the growth of carbon capture, transport, utilization, and sequestration across the U.S. and improve the lifecycle impacts of conventional ethanol.

The primary reason for this phenomenon is the greenhouse gas effect that primarily comes from the destruction of the forest cover and conventional energy production. This would cause extreme weather conditions, consequently imperilling the natural habitats, ecosystems and all the Earth\u2019s activities. Emission of an enormous amount of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) has become the primary reason for global warming; so, it is vital to advance towards novel techniques to alleviate the issue. Within a portfolio of options, CO2 sequestration has gained growing attention \u2013 aimed at carbon capture and storage in geological formations. In this context, CO2 sequestration in coal reservoirs is identified as an effective method, because the process is associated with enhanced coalbed methane (ECBM) extraction \u2013 that further offsets the cost of CO2 storage in coal reservoirs. The successful implementation of the process would certainly lead to a pollution-free world and ultimately a better future, through the mitigation of the greenhouse gas effect.\n\nAlthough the fundamental physics of CO2 sequestration have been evolved over several decades, there are some grey areas and unexplored aspects, that need further improvement through investigations. For instance, the injection of CO2 into coal affects its structural properties, and consequently, the efficiency of the sequestration process as well as the long-term integrity of the reservoir. The coal-CO2 interaction is a complicated physico-chemical and thermodynamic process that depends on multiple parameters, which in turn makes the evaluations quite challenging. A deep understanding of the structural alterations, in terms of coal hydro-mechanical properties, is thus essential to optimize the process, while minimizing the reservoir damage. Considering the above aspects, this research aims to comprehensively characterize the alterations in hydraulic and mechanical parameters of CO2-interacted coal, through a combination of systematic experimental, numerical and statistical analyses, integrated with advanced image analysis techniques and chemical analyses. The study is specifically focused on analysing the fully-coupled CO2 flow\u2013adsorption\u2013deformation process in coal and investigating the consequent hydro-mechanical modifications occur in coal structure, due to the complex coal-CO2 interaction.\n\nInitially, the fully-coupled process in a single coal matrix block was modelled, in which the multiple diffusion mechanisms in matrix pore network were simulated using a theoretically-extended diffusion modelling approach, and the consequent CO2 adsorption-induced matrix swelling was modelled and validated with experimental results. The analysis was then extended on a fractured coal geometry at the coal constituent-scale, through the inclusion of a 3D \u2013 discrete fracture matrix (DFM) network, in which the alterations in local fracture aperture and the subsequent fracture permeability were investigated. In general, the results conclude that the CO2 interaction-induced hydro-mechanical alterations of a fractured coal seam are largely geometry-dependent and highly-localized; thus, should be resolved accurately through a fully-coupled DFM modelling approach. Next, a series of experimental, numerical and statistical studies was conducted to further assess the CO2-interaction-induced complex mechanical property alterations in coal. The alterations in compressive strength, Young\u2019s modulus, brittleness index and dynamic moduli were experimentally investigated, in which the temporal and localized mechanical alterations were specifically analysed in detail. A numerical model was developed to evaluate the free and adsorbed CO2-induced compressive strength alterations in coal, under both confined and unconfined conditions. The compressive strength was determined with the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion, where a theoretically-modified cohesion model was derived, by integrating the effective stress change and the surface energy change \u2013 caused by CO2 interaction. Further, a statistical analysis was conducted using advanced soft computing techniques to predict the mechanical property alterations in coal, under different CO2 interaction conditions. The studies combinedly conclude that CO2 interaction results in adverse mechanical alterations in coal and the developed numerical and statistical models are capable of accurately simulating/capturing this behaviour. Finally, the conclusions, recommendations for future research and an insight into the field-application of CO2 sequestration technique were provided based on the results of the combined analyses.\n\nOverall, the outcome of this research is intended to provide knowledge and insight into the productivity and safety of the CO2 sequestration in coal reservoirs, by conclusively evaluating the CO2 interaction-induced structural alterations in coal, in terms of its hydro-mechanical properties. The information, results and conclusions given herein can be utilised by researchers to build upon and will be beneficial on reducing the global warming and climate change, through effectively minimising the atmospheric CO2 level.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "fd9e100bc4a6ec486109144c186d0dd587c09319", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2588875474", "CorpusId": 136152176}, "title": "Impact of chemical and mechanical processes on wellbore integrity in CO2 storage systems", "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), involving the capture of CO2 at large point sources, such as power plants, followed by long-term storage in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs or saline aquifers remains a key option for reducing CO2 emissions while fossil fuel use continues. For CCS to be effective, the injected CO2 must remain confined to the target reservoir by a suitable caprock formation. However, the wellbores needed to access the reservoir inevitably penetrate this natural caprock seal, forming obvious pathways for potential leakage of CO2. Moreover, the artificial barriers created in wellbores to prevent unwanted fluid migration typically consist of steel and Portland-based cement, which both are prone to chemical attack by CO2-rich fluids. Wellbores also experience changes in temperature and stress state during CO2 injection, which can lead to the development of mechanical damage, such as fractures in cement seals or debonding at material interfaces, creating pathways for CO2-rich fluids to penetrate the wellbore. This PhD thesis is a predominantly experimental study, aimed at investigating the effect of CO2 on the mechanical and chemical integrity of wellbores in geological storage systems for CO2. In particular, this study addresses effects of mechanical damage and chemical alteration (and their interplay) on the transport properties of fractured cement and of casing-cement interfaces, which present widely perceived leakage risks. The main objectives include a) determining the effect of CO2-induced reactions on the mechanical properties of fractured wellbore cement, b) characterizing the key chemical reactions in cement-steel-CO2-brine systems, c) determining the effect of these reactions on the transport properties of debonding defects at casing-cement interfaces in wellbores, d) understanding the underlying reactive transport processes on the metre length-scale, and e) determining whether chemical reactions that involve a solid volume increase and develop a force of crystallisation may be used to remediate or prevent wellbore leakage (e.g. by mechanically eliminating or reducing defect apertures to the point where CO2-induced reactive transport leads to self-sealing behaviour). These aims are addressed using batch reaction experiments, permeametry experiments, conventional triaxial compression tests, long-range reactive flow-through experiments, numerical reactive transport simulations, and uniaxial CaO hydration-deformation (force of crystallisation) experiments.

Produced natural gas, shallow groundwater, and soil vadose gas samples were collected at the CONSOL Energy Inc. CO2 Sequestration Pilot Test Site located in Marshall County, WV to test the feasibility using carbon isotope signatures to detect potential leakage of CO2 into overlying formations. CO2 was injected into the Upper Freeport coal seam at a depth of 396 m below valley bottom surface intermittently from September 2009 to December 2013. Water and gas samples were collected for isotopic analysis over a 12-month period (August 2013-August 2014). One set of water and gas samples collected in August 2013 was during an extended period of injection. The rest of the samples were collected during times the system was down or during the post-injection monitoring period that began in January 2014. The distinct carbon isotope signatures of the injected CO2, soil CO2, and coal bed CO2 allows us to use \u03b413C as a natural tracer to detect any potential leakage from the injection coal bed into the overlying coal bed, aquifers and shallow soil zone. The range of the carbon isotope values observed in each of the overlying systems (i.e. overlying Pittsburgh coal seam, groundwater aquifer and shallow soil) indicate carbon originated from natural sources and processes within individual systems. There appears to be no influence of the injected CO2 on the \u03b413C values of the overlying systems.

As part of the BGS opportunities fund programme, this project has, for the first time, evaluated interactions between fluids saturated with carbon dioxide/Sherwood Sandstone/microbes (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) in transport experiments, using BGS developed apparatus under pressurised subsurface conditions. This pilot study has highlighted the impacts of differences in the physical characteristics of core Sherwood Sandstone samples collected adjacent to each other in a core sample, and the ability of P. aeruginosa to survive in CO2 saturated artificial groundwater and the potential to form a biofilm in an environment suitable likely to be found at a carbon capture and storage location. These results demonstrate that in this short study, the injection of P. aeruginosa into the biotic experiment does not appear to impact on the physical transport properties of the Sherwood Sandstone, although the presence of CO2 appears to enhance the mobilisation of a number of chemical species. However, in other work which utilised the same organism and rock type but without introduction of CO2 saturated fluid, post-inoculation injection changes were observed. These included short but rapid saw-tooth like changes in the pressure profile (Wragg et al, 2012).

Among all the fossil fuels used at thermal power plants, coal produces the greatest amount of C O2 per unit calorific value as compared with the other fossil fuels. Thus, coal fired power plants seem to be one of the significant sources of C O2 emission and are required to reduce CO2 emission into the atmosphere effectively and economically. The oxy-fuel combustion technology is expected to be one of the options for C O2 capture from coal fired power plant. Our feasible study results on this area suggested that the oxy-fuel coal combustion process is one candidate of the cost -effective CO2 capture processes. In the process of capturing CO2 by the oxy-fuel combustion, O2 is separated from the combustion air by air separation unit and is used for burning the pulverized coal in the furnace. And it is theoretically possible to concentrate the CO2 concentration in the flue gas up to 90% or higher at the boiler outlet. The flue gas, which mostly consists of C O2, is recirculated for the sake of transporting the pulverized coal to the burners through the pulverizers and of controlling the flame temperature. In our previous studies, the oxy-fuel process can help the NOx emission to reduce drastically, compared with the conventional air combustion process. On the basis of our previous study results for oxyfuel combustion, we are performing the demonstration project in Australia called \u201c Callide Oxyfuel Project\u201d. The project is now under way for applying oxy-fuel combustion to an existing plant by way of demonstration and is implemented at the power generation system in Callide-A power plant No.4 unit with a capacity of 30MWe in Australia.

Waste fines, representing more than 20% of current US crushed limestone production (410 tonnes/yr), could provide an inexpensive or free source of AWL carbonate.

The Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) mandates parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (2012) \" to develop a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention \" that will provide the global framework for managing the climate change problem, in particular the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions after 2020.

The targets, allocation of mitigation commitments and resources, and modalities of implementation of the post-Kyoto climate agreement will significantly affect not only the environmental and resource pillar of sustainable development but also the economic and social pillars. International negotiations are underway in both of these areas. Some progress has been made but there is still a long way to go until formal agreements can be signed.

First, there are differential benefits to examining the percepions of members of the general public and of individuals living ear potential CCS sites. To examine whether there is public support or national policies including CCS, research should be conducted ith members of the general population. To examine whether there s public support for a specific CCS site, research should be conucted in the nearby community. Although we agree with Malone t al. that opinions expressed in a research setting may not transate into action (e.g., organizing rallies for or against CCS), such oncerns apply to studies conducted with members of the genral public and to studies with individuals living near potential CS sites. Even if most people may not act on their beliefs, demoratic governments should consider public opinion when making ecisions about whether or not to include CCS in a national energy ortfolio, and where to locate CCS sites. Indeed, many existing pubic policies are informed by public opinion (Brace and Boyea, 2008; urstein, 2003; Lax and Phillips, 2009; Wald, 2008).

Benefits from biodiversity to humans are various, and essential services provided to the society includes material goods such as food, timber, medicines, and fiber; as well as various services appreciated to underpin ecological functions such as flood control, climate regulation, nutrient cycling, maintaining hydrological cycles, cleaning water and air, soil formation and soil storage (MEA, 2005), added to the cultural, social, aesthetic and ethical values (Swift et al., 2004), pollination and pest control, carbon sequestration and storage (Hooper et al., 2005; Barton and Pretty, 2010). These functions are appreciated to secure long-term flows of benefits from nature by providing resilience to disturbance and environmental change (Hooper et al., 2005) and other economic and social contributions which are essential to human being (Gallai et al., 2009). Increasing domination of ecosystems by humans is steadily transforming them into poor systems (Vtousek et al., 1997; Sala et al., 2000). Humans have extensively altered the global environment, changing the global biogeochemical cycles, transforming land and enhancing the mobility of biodiversity, while fossil-fuel combustion and deforestation increased the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide (Stuart et al., 2000). Changes in biodiversity and its links to ecosystem properties affect the cultural, intellectual, aesthetic and spiritual values that are important to society; in addition to economic impacts related to the reduction of food resources, fuel, structural materials, medicinal or genetic resources as well as abundance of other species that control ecosystem processes, leading to further changes in community composition and vulnerability to invasion (Stuart et al., 2000). The imperative to reduce human impacts on biodiversity has wide political recognition in various countries. There is an increasing array of national, regional, and international policy mechanisms aimed at biodiversity conservation (Rands et al., 2010). Creation of protected areas, species protection and recovery measures for threatened species, ecosystem restoration, ex situ and in situ conservation services, incorporating consideration of biodiversity conservation into management practices in sectors such as agriculture, forestry and fisheries, capture of benefits by local communities, public awareness, communication and education, integration of biodiversity conservation and development are some of the action taken for biodiversity conservation (MEA, 2005) cited among others. Rwanda, like other countries of the Albertine lift namely Uganda, Tanzania, Democratic Republic of Congo, Burundi and Zambia, has a remarkable variety of ecosystems inhabited by a variety of flora and fauna species (GoR, 2010), with many endemic species. Conservation efforts are based on the creation of protected areas, integration of communities in conservation activities, revenue sharing and establishment of various laws such as the law governing biodiversity (GoR, 2013) and the list of protected animals and plants (GoR, 2008). Biodiversity conservation education has been a priority of the government, and since 2010, Rwanda Environmental management Authority introduces the environmental education in its strategy and action plan for 2010 \u2013 2015, where conserving, preserving and restoring ecosystems as well as protecting biodiversity and ensuring sustainable use of natural resources were given the priority (REMA, 2010).

Consequently, pre-service teachers might not be able to acquire enough skills in biodiversity conservation and may fail to understand what biodiversity conservation is and why we have to conserve. This shall in turn affect sustainable biodiversity conservation, as they shall not be well skilled to teach this subject in primary and secondary education of Rwanda. Therefore, there is a need of study of the level of understanding of pre-service teachers vis-\u00e0-vis biodiversity conservation in Rwanda. This study has the aim to measure the level of knowledge, awareness, and attitude of preservice teachers towards biodiversity conservation. The main goal of the research was to contribute to the quality education in Rwanda, while respecting biodiversity conservation strategies.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "15e9c620f22e2575e8b043332353a12a587762d5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2917243474", "DOI": "10.11575/PRISM/32014", "CorpusId": 134091126}, "title": "Carbon Capture in Alberta: Costs, Benefits, and Policy", "abstract": "Alberta\u2019s industrial and power sectors have many facilities classified as large emitters, with highconcentration carbon dioxide emissions from large point sources. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a technically feasible technology that reduces greenhouse gas emissions in existing industries by reducing high-concentration carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from large point sources, and is recognized as a key factor for reaching international climate change targets. Alberta hosts two commercial-scale CCS projects jointly funded by the provincial government and private industry, but there are no additional projects for the foreseeable future. CCS deployment is often obstructed by high project costs and risks in developing an emerging technology to commercial scale. This research reexamines CCS in Alberta and provides governments with the opportunity to consider complementary policies for CCS deployment that can benefit Albertans as a whole. This research presents a Multiple Account Benefit-Cost Analysis of carbon capture and storage projects in Alberta, from the perspective of Albertans. There is a significant cost to private firms and industry to invest in CCS. However, as carbon prices escalate to $50 per tonne by 2022, CCS becomes more economical for the cement industry, hydrogen processing, ammonia and chemical production. When impacts in the taxpayer, environment, social, and economic activity accounts are considered, there is an overall benefit to Albertans in using CCS to reduce emissions. However, public perception of CCS projects remains a crucial factor. To reduce barriers to CCS development and increase investment in CCS, a policy strategy is needed. The policy strategy needs to address both the market failures that lead to emissions and underinvestment in research. Therefore, in addition to carbon pricing, environmental taxation such as tax credits specifically for CCS projects can encourage research and development. To also signal government support to the public and investors, existing provincial and federal government incentives for low-carbon and clean-energy projects should extend to include CCS in both the industrial and power sectors.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "1afcf60409bc2426117c898e883a34ba86b4d26b", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "1247605", "DOI": "10.1007/BF03188746", "CorpusId": 33532117, "PubMed": "17778374"}, "title": "New Books", "abstract": "This book contains the proceedings of the International Symposium on \u00abSynthesis and Applications of Isotopically Labeled Compounds\u00bb held in Kansas City, Missouri, U.S.A. from June 6 to 11, 1982.

It first presents a conceptual framework synthesized from the business studies, entrepreneurship, evolutionary economics, innovation studies, management science, organization studies, political science, and sociology literature. This framework suggests that corporate approaches to clean technology innovation will cut across the four dimensions of organizational multiplicity and stakeholder involvement, information sharing, coordination and control, and market orientation. It then explores how eight firms\u2014the Algal Carbon Conversion Flagship and Aurora Algae (biofuel), DONG and Statoil (carbon capture and storage), Tesla and Volkswagen (electric vehicles), and Siemens and Vestas (offshore wind turbines)\u2014approach clean technology development with \u201copen innovation\u201d attributes mixed with \u201cclosed\u201d attributes. Although the study finds striking similarities among the particular approaches embraced by each corporate actor, it also notes that approaches are technology and firm specific, and the potential for different permutations leads to an almost endless number of possible stylistic combinations. The innovation profiles depicted also reveal conflict and competition among various stakeholders, the implication being that corporate innovation in the energy sector remains a conflicted, disjointed, and messy process.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "b9baf4309a1b16655a5abc6728f3e01e5e684fbf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "301883248", "CorpusId": 108248661}, "title": "MULTI-CRITERIA ASSESSMENT MODEL FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE SYSTEMS", "abstract": "A flexible and transparent multi-criteria model is being developed to evaluate the sustainability of carbon capture technologies and chains: to guide policy makers, investors and technology developers on important challenges and opportunities.

Numerous industrial methods exist, but developing alternative, greener and more energy-efficient methods is essential. Two pieces of work were investigated in this thesis towards developing alternative methods and are presented as two individual chapters, each with their own introduction, results, discussion, conclusion and future work sections. A general introduction to carbon dioxide and the vitality of decreasing carbon dioxide emissions acts as a preface to these chapters and is presented in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 examines promoting Carbon Dioxide Utilisation with new chromium(III) salophen complexes and Chapter 3 investigates a novel electrochemical carbon capture and mineralisation methodology. \n \nA range of chromium(III) salophen complexes were synthesised and were found to catalyse the synthesis of cyclic carbonates from carbon dioxide and terminal or internal epoxides at ambient conditions.

First, renewable energies give more CO2 savings in replacing fossil fuels in the power sector than producing hydrogen for heat generation in the industry sector. Therefore, significant quantities of green hydrogen will not be available until renewable energies have replaced fossil fuels in power generation.

This dissertation presents three applications of satellite geodesy in environmental and climate change. Three satellite geodesy techniques are used: high-precision Global Positioning System (GPS), the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). In the first study, I use coastal uplift observed by GPS to study the annual changes in mass loss of the Greenland ice sheet. The data show both spatial and temporal variations of coastal ice mass loss and suggest that a combination of warm atmospheric and oceanic condition drove these variations. In the second study, I use GRACE monthly gravity change estimates to constrain recent freshwater flux from Greenland. The data show that Arctic freshwater flux started to increase rapidly in the mid-late 1990s, coincident with a decrease in the formation of dense Labrador Sea Water, a key component of the deep southward return flow of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). Recent freshening of the polar oceans may be reducing formation of Labrador Sea Water and hence may be weakening the AMOC. In the third study, I use InSAR to monitor ground deformation caused by CO2 injection at an enhanced oil recovery site in west Texas. Carbon capture and storage can reduce CO2 emitted from power plants, and is a promising way to mitigate anthropogenic warming. From 2007 to 2011, \u223c24 million tons of CO2 were sequestered in this field, causing up to 10 MPa pressure buildup in a reservoir at depth, and surface uplift up to 10 cm.

Although China has made substantial progress in renewable energy deployment and has promised to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, the increasing CO2 emissions reflect a paradox in China's energy revolution, suggesting that second-best choices are necessary. Large-scale deployment of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) can avoid stranding assets in existing fossil energy industries and thus incur less resistance from incumbents. With an estimated storage capacity of 3120 GtCO2, China has great potential to deploy CCUS. The more quickly CCUS scales up, the less the cost of mitigation in the future. Although China has issued many policies to promote CCUS development and achieved significant progress through demonstration projects, barriers still exist for its large-scale deployment. Barriers include the lack of CCUS-specific legal and regulatory models, relatively high investment requirements, and low public perception and acceptance towards CCUS. To effectively promote this second-best choice, institutional reforms are critical, including enabling climate change legislation, carbon tax policy, risk avoidance and risk sharing measures, compensation, and strengthened public engagement. Key policy insights Large-scale deployment of Negative Emission Technologies will be needed in China and beyond to address the climate emergency. Market distortions impede renewable energy development in China, making large-scale deployment of CCUS an essential second-best choice. Detailed legal and regulatory rule changes can reduce market uncertainties and provide a legal foundation and mandate for CCUS development. Particularly when source control measures \u2013 such as renewable energy deployment, industrial restructuring and energy efficiency improvements \u2013 face bottlenecks, the scaling up of negative emission technologies is essential.

Excessive application of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has been pervasive in this region, and the unrecovered N eventually escaped from croplands in forms of nitrous oxide (N2O) emission and N leaching. Mitigating these negative impacts is hindered by a lack of practical information on where to focus and how much mitigation potential to expect. At a large scale, process-based crop models are the primary tools for predicting variables required by decision making, but their applications are prohibited by expensive computational and data storage costs. To overcome these challenges, we built a series of metamodels to learn the key mechanisms regarding the carbon (C) and N cycle from a well-validated process-based biogeochemical model, ecosys. The trained metamodel captures over 98% of the variability of the ecosys simulated outputs for 99 randomly selected counties in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana. To identify hotspots with high mitigation potential, we introduce net societal benefit (NSB) as an indicator for synthesizing the loss in yield and social benefits through emissions and pollutants avoided. Our results show that reducing N fertilizer by 10% leads to 9.8% less N2O emissions and 9.6% less N leaching at the cost of 4.9% more SOC depletion and 0.6% yield reduction over the study region. The estimated total annual NSB is $395 M (uncertainty ranges from $114 M to $1271 M), including $334 from social benefits (uncertainty ranges from $46 M to $1076 M), $100 M from saving fertilizer (uncertainty ranges from $13 M to $455 M), and \u2212$40 M due to yield changes (uncertainty ranges from \u2212$261 M to $69 M).

Although the uncertainty range suggests that developing such a high-resolution framework is not yet settled and the scenario based estimations are not appropriate to inform the management practices for individual farmers, our efforts shed light on the new generation of analytical tools for life cycle assessment.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "932f1d3d66b95aee6b6b35beb3ae75e76b9cfa19", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2009458053", "DOI": "10.1021/ES803421U", "CorpusId": 129441215}, "title": "Models of carbon storage get real", "abstract": "New simulations of carbon capture and storage are helping scientists edge toward implementing the greenhouse-gas-cutting technology on a large scale.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "a41ffe3f50115cb4d80ceb59b5832f98a45b66bf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2960434849", "CorpusId": 199109176}, "title": "Mitigating Carbon Dioxide Emissions in the Cement Industry Through Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "The cement industry is responsible for 7% of industrial energy use, the third largest energy consumer in the world. The industry is also responsible for 7% of global carbon dioxide emissions, the second largest industrial emitter. With current trends continuing, global cement usage will rise with population and urbanization. The low-carbon transition of the cement industry requires innovative technologies and producer cooperation. Carbon capture and storage, known as CCS, is a safe and sustainable solution to significantly reduce the amount being released into the atmosphere. Through CCS, carbon dioxide reacts with natural alkaline minerals, such as fly ash, to create carbonate (a mineral). Carbonate is then stored in concrete as an aggregate where it will never the atmosphere.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "a9e4e731aa9232c0810e7ddacc830ce363589ee4", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 18588876}, "title": "Opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions through livestock wastemanagement in Florida", "abstract": "M anagement of livestock wastes can affect greenhouse gas emissions through attenuating both methane and nitrous oxide emissions, as well as by displacing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel use that can be avoided through biogas production and use. Methane is naturally produced from the anaerobic decomposition of livestock manure and is a potent greenhouse gas with 21 times the greenhouse warming potential of CO2, on a mass ratio basis (U.S. EPA 2007). Nitrous oxide is naturally produced as a result of the nitrogen cycle where organic nitrogen in manure and urine undergoes nitrification and denitrification. Nitrous oxide is an even more potent greenhouse gas, with a greenhouse warming potential 310 times that of CO2 on a mass ratio basis (U.S. EPA 2007). Unfortunately, estimates for N2O emissions are uncertain and methods to reduce these emissions are not well developed. In contrast, methods for reducing CH4 emissions have received more attention. Anaerobic digestion in a closed vessel allows microbial degradation of manure to biogas containing CH4. Biogas can be used as a renewable fuel to displace fossil fuel consumption, which not only lessens CH4 emissions from manure management but also lowers fossil CO2 emissions. Methane emissions from livestock include enteric emissions and manure management emissions (IPCC 1996). Enteric emissions of CH4 occur principally from the ruminant activity in cows (dairy and beef) and are a function of feed quality and intake. Other than reducing cow numbers, there is little opportunity to reduce enteric CH4 emissions. In contrast, CH4 emissions from livestock manure management are impacted by chosen management options. EPA (2007) estimates that manure management contributed 41.3 Tg of CO2eq from CH4 emissions and 9.5 Tg of CO2eq from N2O emissions to the U.S. greenhouse gas emissions inventory in 2005. Liquid handling of manure and long-term manure storage increase CH4 emissions. Dry handling systems, dry storage, and short-term storage lower CH4 emissions. Anaerobic digestion of manure with biogas capture can result in lower CH4 emissions, yet some leakage of biogas (estimated to average 1%) prevents complete elimination of CH4 emissions from livestock manure management. IPCC (1996) has developed methods for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from livestock manure management that account for climate, animal type, regional development, and management practices. Generally, the number of animals, the average manure volatile solids (VS) production, and the maximum methane yield (Bo) of the VS are combined with an emission factor to estimate methane emissions. Emission factors have been developed based on both scientific studies and measurements, as well as through model development and calculations. The emission factors vary with region, climate, animal type, and manure handling, thus adding a level of uncertainty to greenhouse gas emissions estimates. For cattle, IPCC (1996) has developed both Tier 1 methods (simple) and Tier 2 methods (more complicated) for estimating emissions.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "34ea0b1a53148b4c480825f3ec18fa7e15ac2b53", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 237251279}, "title": "Revisio\u0301n sobre captura y almacenamiento de carbono para ingenieri\u0301a de la construccio\u0301n", "abstract": "Global warming and climatic changes due to pollution have triggered the global efforts to reduce the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide.
