Carbon capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS) is an established and crucial emission reduction technology capable of achieving near\u2010zero\u2010emission from fossil fuels. Hydrogen, a zero\u2010carbon fuel, provides energy security while improving air quality. However, hydrogen is commonly derived from fossil fuels with significant associated CO2 emission. Hence, this study investigates the feasibility of integrating CCUS in the hydrogen industry, particularly from technical, sustainability, and policy perspectives. This study also critically reviews existing CCUS and hydrogen production technologies and discusses the prospects and challenges of each. Studies show that CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2\u2010EOR) and CO2 enhanced coal\u2010bed methane recovery (CO2\u2010ECBM) are promising CCUS technologies in China, while producing clean hydrogen from fossil fuels with CCUS and water electrolysis are ideal development route.

Besides, CO2 hydrogenation integrated chemical production is becoming increasingly popular to achieve carbon emission reduction and low\u2010carbon economy. However, the relatively high costs and lack of hydrogen transportation infrastructure is currently the major bottleneck restricting the development of CCUS and hydrogen industry.

It then briefly explores the policy implications and possible macro-economic costs of moving to a low-carbon energy system. Technological transitions are relevant to climate change and energy because the energy system is a major technological system in society, and to reduce its carbon emissions dramatically, as is required if dangerous anthropogenic climate change is to be avoided, will require a full technological transition. There are many low-carbon technologies with the potential for large-scale deployment. Simulations suggest that the decarbonisation of the electricity system, involving any or all of carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and renewables, with increasing use of electricity in the residential and transport sectors, will be required. There may also be a role for bioenergy and hydrogen. In all cases strong public policies will be required to achieve large cuts in carbon emissions, involving carbon pricing, technology support and removing barriers to lifestyle and behaviour changes. Currently, while many different policies have been implemented, they have not been strongly enough applied to achieve sustained emissions reduction. Most models suggest that the macroeconomic costs of substantial cuts in carbon emissions are relatively small (1-4% GDP by 2050) compared to the costs of unabated climate change.

Traditional solutions for reducing emissions, including energy efficiency, using alternative fuels, and clinker\u2010to\u2010cement ratio reduction, are insufficient to ensure the necessary mitigation. Based on the concept of material efficiency, this study identifies new alternatives for reducing CO2 emissions by adopting a set of technological solutions to increase the industrialization of cement\u2010based products and the use of fillers considering a cradle\u2010to\u2010use approach. Besides, increasing the filler content in mortars and plain concrete is a desirable strategy, because it increases the carbonation rate, accelerating the CO2 sequestration from the atmosphere. Based on data from the Brazilian cement industry technology roadmap, this study quantitatively evaluates, up to 2050, the CO2 mitigation potential and the reduction of cement consumption for each adopted technological solution. The marginal abatement costs are also included to quantify each considered solution's cost\u2010effectiveness and compared with alternatives like carbon capture and storage.

Area-based estimates of terrestrial biomass and carbon are best captured when biophysical measures of horizontal and vertical vegetation structure can be obtained. Given the highly complementary nature and quasi-synchronous data acquisition of the 2000 Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), the Landsat-based 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD), and data sets from the national LANDFIRE project, an exceptional opportunity exists for exploiting data synergies afforded by the fusion of these high-resolution, spatially explicit data sources. Whereas the thematic layers of the NLCD and LANDFIRE are suitable for characterizing horizontal structure (i.e., cover type, canopy density, etc.), SRTM provides information relating to the vertical structure, i.e., primarily height. Currently, a project funded under the NASA \u201cCarbon Cycle Science\u201d program \u2013 \u201cThe National Biomass and Carbon Dataset 2000 \u2013 NBCD2000\u201d \u2013 is underway to generate a high-spatial resolution ecoregional database of circa-2000 vegetation canopy height, aboveground biomass, and carbon stocks for the conterminous U.S. from these data sets. In order to develop regression tree models for spatially extensive estimates of vegetation height and aboveground live dry biomass from the remote sensing data, reference data from the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program, and selected airborne lidar-derived vegetation parameters are used. The estimation of carbon storage in vegetation is based on the established biomass-to-carbon conversion of [carbon = 0.5 * biomass]. The NBCD2000 project follows the same ecoregional mapping zone approach employed by the NLCD and LANDFIRE projects.

We adapt the method developed by Bachu (2003) to the Indonesia geological characteristics.

In DICE, CO2 emissions are controlled to the extent in which a hypothetical optimal carbon tax justifies CO2 reduction by firms: in our analysis, CCS is used when the optimal tax level is higher than the price of CCS. The analysis assesses the economic optimality of CCS use with a range of different assumptions. The simulation particularly focuses on the difference of results originating from two sets of general assumptions on climate change modeling, reflecting the current debate on the economics of climate change (see for example, Heal, 2008): (1) Parameterization of the standard DICE; (2) Alternative assumptions whose hints are drawn from Stern (2007). In the standard DICE cases, the model calculation shows that at the price level of $25/tCO2 ($92/tC), CCS is introduced around in the middle of the twenty-first century. With the alternative assumptions (e.g., near-zero discount rate), CCS begins to be utilized massively earlier in the century. The two sets of results lead to contrasting policy implications on the future CCS use; this is particularly problematic in the CCS context since its benefits are not always clear-cut (e.g., limitedness of secondary benefits besides CO2 reduction, uncertainties about the validity of technology itself).

By using an analytical dynamic optimization model, I analyze the optimal paths of CCS use, CCS's social costs, and their difference from the operational costs. The second piece of this dissertation performs a numerical simulation of potential CCS use by using a modified version of DICE (Dynamic Integrated model on Climate and Economy), one of the most widely used integrated assessment models on climate change.

In order to fulfill this sensitive task, the IPCC formed an extended peer community of participants, including not only professional scientists but also other stakeholders such as nongovernmental organization (NGO) members, and the project made some success with a relative good reception by a broad range of people.

The geological, technical, and economic feasibility for CO2 storage has been assessed in terms of carbon sequestration in geological structures and the legal framework for safe geological storage of fossil CO2.

Based on the examination of geological characteristics, the most fitting is the middle Cambrian reservoir in the Baltic sedimentary basin, and one of the most prospective structural traps is the geological structure of Dobele, with an estimated storage capacity of 150 Mt CO2. This study revealed that the storage capacity of the middle Cambrian reservoir (up to 1000 Mt CO2) within the borders of Southwestern Latvia is sufficient for carbon capture and safe storage for the whole Baltic region, and that geological structures in Latvia have the capacity to store all fossil CO2 emissions produced by stationary sources in the Baltic States for several decades.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "c36d78b02fba64a07395cac86613574b1b39589e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2781924912", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJRMMS.2017.11.018", "CorpusId": 134967800}, "title": "Yield envelope assessment as a preliminary screening tool to determine carbon capture and storage viability in depleted southern north-sea hydrocarbon reservoirs", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "bd8763d478f6222910fb5d372cf892c943b01bab", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3126921879", "DOI": "10.1039/D0FD00139B", "CorpusId": 234332809, "PubMed": "34259689"}, "title": "Curing time: a temporally explicit life cycle CO2 accounting of mineralization, bioenergy, and CCS in the concrete sector.", "abstract": "The decarbonization of concrete production requires a multi-pronged approach including the abatement of CO2 emissions from cement production as well as storage of CO2 within concrete itself.

Nowadays, just about one-ten-thousandth of the global annual emissions are being captured and geologically-stored, and therefore with today&#8217;s emission panorama, CCS large-scale deployment is more pressing than ever. In this study, a 3D model that represents the key reservoir uncertainties for a CCUS pilot was constructed to investigate the feasibility of CO2 storage in the Unayzah Formation in Saudi Arabia. The study site covers the area of the city of Riyadh and the Hawtah and Nuayyim Trends, which contain one of the most prolific petroleum-producing systems in the country. The Unayzah reservoir is highly stratified and it is subdivided into three compartments: the Unayzah C (Ghazal Member), the Unayzah B (Jawb Member), and the Unayzah A (Wudayhi and Tinat Members). This formation was deposited under a variety of environments, such as glaciofluvial, fluvial, eolian, and coastal plain. Facies probability trend maps and well log data were used to generate a facies model that accounted for the architecture, facies distribution, and lateral and vertical heterogeneity of this high complexity reservoir. Porosity and predicted permeability logs were used with Sequential Gaussian Simulation and co-kriging methods to construct the porosity and permeability models. The static model was then used for CO2 injection simulation purposes to understand the impact of the flow conduits, barriers, and baffles in CO2 flow in all dimensions. Similarly, the CO2 simulations allowed us to better understand the CO2 entrapment process and to estimate a more realistic and reliable CO2 storage capacity of the Unayzah reservoir in the area. To test the robustness of the model predictions, geological uncertainty quantification and a sensitivity analysis were run. Parameters such as porosity, permeability, pay thickness, anisotropy, and connectivity were analyzed as well as how various combinations between them affected the CO2 storage capacity, injectivity, and containment. This approach could improve the storage efficiency of CO2 exceeding 60%. The analyzed reservoir was found to be a promising storage site.

But most available technologies are still on the study or laboratory-scale level, so that considerable R&D efforts are needed to achieve commercialization level. The Graz Cycle originally presented in 1995 by Jericha [1] is an oxyfuel technology and promises highest efficiency using state-of-the-art turbine materials and improved thermodynamic developments in a comparatively complex interaction of rotating machinery, condensers and heat exchanger components. But although detailed conceptual design for all main components has been presented, there is still a large step towards a Graz Cycle pilot demonstration plant. In order to facilitate construction of a demonstration plant we consider the performance of a near-term Graz Cycle process design based on modest cycle data and available turbomachinery components using a simplified flow scheme. The work is supported by on-going development work for a first generation oxyfuel turbine that has already been undertaken by Clean Energy Systems, Inc. [2]. Their further work on a second generation oxyfuel turbine received $30 million funding support from the U.S. Department of Energy in September 2010 [3]. Two near-term Graz Cycle plants are presented based on basic and advanced operating conditions of the proposed commercially available turbine. Besides the turbine the additional equipment for a first-generation cycle is discussed. The predicted optimum net efficiency is 23.2% (HHV). A near-term zero-emission power plant can only be commercially attractive if it will be deployed in a niche market. Therefore an economic analysis commensurate with an early pre-FEED conceptual study is carried out for the U.S. Gulf Coast where revenue from multiple product streams that could include power, steam, CO2 and water, as well as argon and (potentially) nitrogen from the ASU is provided. The economic analysis suggests that a capital investment of $94 million can secure construction of a 13.2 MWe zero emission oxyfuel power plant and yield a 14.5% (unlevered) return on capital invested.Copyright \u00a9 2011 by ASME", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "68d8bdf3707e363579401faf199ec69722a1f43d", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1016/j.biombioe.2022.106406", "CorpusId": 247366812}, "title": "Carbon dioxide removal potential from decentralised bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and the relevance of operational choices", "abstract": null, "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "6999ea6c5cbcf3551a7f195889f5826d5f5c39c8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2169787167", "DOI": "10.1557/MRS.2012.222", "CorpusId": 138028596}, "title": "Super-capacitors take charge in Germany", "abstract": "Yury Gogotsi, Drexel University Philip Ball, p.ball@btinternet.com T yellow-and-white Stadtbahn trams criss-crossing the streets of Mannheim in southern Germany look unremarkable, but some of them are literally carrying what could be the key to greener public transportation. The electrically powered vehicles use 30% less energy than their equivalents in most other cities because they contain onboard systems for capturing the energy that would otherwise be squandered when the trams brake. This energy is converted into electricity, which is then stored in devices called supercapacitors mounted on the tram roof. Supercapacitors are power-storage devices that can supply onboard electrical power in hybrid vehicles. Unlike batteries, supercapacitors can be charged and discharged in seconds and can withstand many hundreds of thousands of such charging cycles. This makes them ideal for energy-saving applications that capitalize on transient opportunities for recharging, such as energy capture during braking, and that require power to be delivered in short bursts of perhaps half a minute or less. They can, for example, help with acceleration or can restart engines that cut out to reduce fuel use and pollution in stop-and-go traffi c. Whereas batteries store energy in chemical form\u2014in substances that can react to release electrical energy\u2014capacitors store it by simply piling up electrical charge on two electrodes. The larger the electrodes and the closer they are, the more energy that can be stored. An ordinary capacitor consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating (dielectric) layer. But a supercapacitor (sometimes called an ultracapacitor) holds its charge a little differently. Typically it contains two conductive porous electrodes\u2014usually made of carbon\u2014 immersed in a liquid electrolyte and separated by a very thin insulating fi lm, usually made of a porous polymer. The charge is stored by adsorption of ions onto the high-surface-area electrodes. When the electrodes are charged, this produces a layer of oppositely charged ions on their surfaces: a so-called electrical double-layer, which is why this type of supercapacitor is often called a doublelayer capacitor. The potential of supercapacitors to assist in powering vehicles was displayed in dramatic fashion in the 24-hour speed race at Le Mans this June, when Toyota fi elded a hybrid TS030 that used them for energy-capture during braking. The devices performed perfectly, but a crash scuppered the vehicle\u2019s bid for glory. The Mannheim trams are rather more sedate, but with their own onboard power, they can keep running across short gaps or disruptions in the electricity line, for example due to ice or where overhead power lines cannot be deployed for aesthetic or technical reasons. The energy source can also be tapped to drive air conditioning, automatic windows, or passenger doors. These trams have been reaping the benefi ts of supercapacitors since 2003 and are now joined by a host of other publictransportation systems in Germany and beyond. Supercapacitor technology is deployed, for example, on Spanish and French trains and hybrid buses all over the world, on construction equipment such as cranes, and on garbage-collection trucks. On buses, it can reduce the effective carbon-dioxide emissions by around 30%, while the Munich-based heavy-vehicle manufacturer MAN estimated that their supercapacitor-fi tted coaches each save around $4,500 a year on fuel costs. Reducing fuel consumption and emissions during the \u201cdead time\u201d of standing at stops, intersections, and traffi c lights is a particularly pressing concern for buses. Since 2001, MAN has been developing hybrid supercapacitor buses called the Lion\u2019s City Hybrid. The current commercial model, available since 2010, cuts diesel consumption by up to 30%, and is now being used on a small scale in Paris and some other European cities. In principle, buses can recharge their supercapacitors not just during braking, but also at every bus stop by making contact with overhead charging lines for just a few seconds. So far the take-up of the technology has been relatively modest. But it looks set to expand both as energy-saving and low-emission technologies become more imperative and as the technical capabilities of supercapacitors improve. Supercapacitors are not by any means a panacea for green transportation: they have a lower total energy density than batteries by one or two orders of magnitude, for example. But they have a higher power density, delivering much more power over a short period of time. \u201cThere is no single perfect energystorage solution, no \u2018one size fi ts all,\u2019\u201d said materials scientist Yury Gogotsi at Drexel University in Philadelphia. \u201cA \u2018battery of the future\u2019 may be a batterysupercapacitor hybrid having the long lifetime, fast charging, and high power of a supercapacitor combined with a high energy density of a battery.\u201d The main producers of supercapacitors worldwide are Nesscap Energy, based in South Korea, and the California-based company Maxwell Technologies.

It\u2019s an innovative approach to reduce greenhouse gas emissions responsible for global warming. If statistics are candid then CCS will contribute to 1/6th of total CO2 emission reduction come 2050 \u2013 as quoted by the International Energy Association. CCS enables capture of CO2 from energy intensive industries viz. cement, iron and steel, chemicals and refining, its transport via ships and pipelines and its subsequent storage. The three methods employed for CO2 capture are pre-combustion, post combustion and oxyfuel. Pre-combustion and post combustion involves capturing CO2 before and after combustion respectively. The last method represents storing all the gases produced as a result after burning the fuel in more oxygen. Critics assert post-combustion as the best and there-by affirm it to be applied to any power plant burning carbon based fuel. The liquefied CO2 is transported and stored by EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) practicing companies for tertiary recovery by reducing the oil density and hence mobilizing the oil. These are also used for Enhanced Coal Bed Methane recovery (ECBM), for extracting methane gas. CCS involves storage in deep geologic zones like deep saline formations and depleted oil reservoirs. It is also deployed at commercial natural gas processing, fertilizers production, synfuel production and hydrogen production facilities. Its future endeavors includes storage in basalt and shale basins although much has not been said about the same. Currently, there are 12 active CCS projects, 8 of which are being practiced in US. Investment for carbon capture is scrutinized for being expensive and a wastage of money which could be utilized in perfecting renewable sources like wind energy and solar energy.

Aquifers are particularly attractive CO2 sinks, in part due to their extensive storage capacities, favourable petrophysical characteristics, and their proximity to CO2 source nodes. To date, studies of CO2\u2013water\u2013rock interactions have almost exclusively focussed on CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers. However, in locations lacking suitable saline reservoirs, such as in southeast Queensland, Australia, where aquifers are generally of low salinity, alternative storage options are being considered. One such option under active assessment is the lower interval of the Jurassic-aged Surat Basin, comprising the Precipice Sandstone, a potential low-salinity primary reservoir, the overlying Evergreen Formation, an interformational seal, and the uppermost Hutton Sandstone, an internally-baffled unit with mixed reservoir-seal characteristics. A detailed mineralogical study of the targeted reservoir system, utilising and comparing several investigatory techniques, including optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and hyperspectral logging (HyLogger), revealed differing lithologies for the three units and provided insight into their CO2 storage characteristics. The Precipice Sandstone is geochemically poorly-reactive, with a clean, quartzose mineralogy dominated by quartz and kaolins. The Evergreen Formation is geochemically reactive, containing abundant feldspar, smectite, chlorite, carbonate and kaolinite. Nonetheless, the fine-grained nature and generally poor reservoir quality indicate an effective interformational seal. The Hutton Sandstone is a heterogeneous unit with mixed reservoir-seal characteristics and reactive intervals containing smectite, chlorite, feldspars and lithics, in addition to common Ca\u2013Fe\u2013Mn\u2013Mg carbonates. Variable clay matrix content and porosity, and locally-significant cementation, indicate a heterogeneous unit with the capacity to buffer emplaced CO2, providing an additional vertical component of capture and storage to the Surat Basin reservoir system. The CO2\u2013water\u2013rock interactions in low-salinity host formations remain largely unexplored for conditions relevant to CO2 injection and storage. In particular, there are uncertainties surrounding the impact of these interactions on mineralogy and rock quality characteristics of both reservoir and seal lithologies in the near-wellbore environment. Batch-reaction experiments conducted under simulated reservoir conditions (T = 60 \u00b0C, P = 120 bar) for 16\u201318 days, coupled with highresolution mineralogical and microstructural studies of rock samples, established that injection of CO2 into low-salinity formations will result in geochemical reactions that are highly dependent on lithology.

Coal is conveyed to a gasifier furnace by CO2 and changed to coal gas by adding oxygen; a methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) method is applied to initiate a cleanup procedure of the coal gas. A water-gas shift converter is employed to heat up the coal gas. The cathode gas of the MCFC is composed of CO2 and O2 with a composition of 66.7/33.3 (noble cathode gas composition). The magnitude of the system\u2019s electrical power output is assumed to be that of a 300 MW class. The calculated net efficiency of the 2.2 MPa pressurised system reached a 60.1% high heating value (HHV) without CO2 recovery. The 2.2 MPa pressurised system, however, has a short lifetime limited by the shortening of electrodes. For this reason, a further 0.15 MPa pressurised system (low pressurised system) efficiency is recorded which has a more promising shortening time of the electrodes. The net efficiency of the low pressurised system is 51.9% HHV without CO2 recovery. Since the coal is gasified using oxygen and the cathode gas of the MCFC is composed of CO2 /O2 , the system\u2019s exhaust gas only includes CO2 , thus the system is ready for the recovery and storage of carbon dioxide (Carbon Capture and Storage ready, CCS ready). For the purpose of estimating the net efficiency with CO2 recovery, a liquid form of CO2 with a pressure of 10MPa is assumed. Using the 2.2 MPa pressurised system, the net efficiency including the consumption of CO2 compression and liquefaction is evaluated at 58.2% HHV. Another simple CO2 closed system configuration without gas turbine is proposed; the net efficiencies of the 2.2 MPa and the 0.15 MPa system including the consumption of CO2 liquefaction are determined at 56.4% and 50.3% HHV, respectively. According to the calculation results, a high efficiency system with CO2 recovery is possible by applying the noble cathode gas in the IG/MCFC systems.Copyright \u00a9 2008 by ASME", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "fe3b2fed836e690ae317a29378cc63cb2641ed70", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3129611837", "DOI": "10.1177/1468087421993359", "CorpusId": 233977120}, "title": "A numerical study of the effects of oxy-fuel combustion under homogeneous charge compression ignition regime", "abstract": "The European Union (EU) has recently adopted new directives to reduce the level of pollutant emissions from non-road mobile machinery engines.

RIVER aims to apply oxy-fuel combustion with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology to eliminate NOx emissions and to capture and store carbon emissions. As part of this project, a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis has been performed to investigate the effects of oxy-fuel combustion on combustion characteristics and engine operating conditions in a diesel engine under Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) mode. A reduced chemical n-heptane-n-butanol-PAH mechanism which consists of 76 species and 349 reactions has been applied for oxy-fuel HCCI combustion modeling. Different diluent strategies based on the volume fraction of oxygen and a diluent gas has been considered over a wide range of air-fuel equivalence ratios. Variation in the diluent ratio has been achieved by adding different percentages of carbon dioxide for a range from 77 to 83\u2009vol.% in the intake charge. Results show that indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) has reduced from 32.7% to 20.9% as the CO2 concentration has increased from 77% to 83% at low engine loads while it doesn\u2019t bring any remarkable change at high engine loads.

A field and laboratory study. Geologica Ultraiectina (315)", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is considered a key technology to reduce worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). One CCS option is to inject CO2 into subsurface coal beds. When combined with simultaneous, enhanced, production of methane naturally present in the coal, this process is referred to as enhanced coalbed methane production (ECBM). However, ECBM is not yet a well-established, mature technology. Demonstration projects are essential for testing the applicability of the ECBM technique under field conditions. The first part of this thesis (Chapters 2 and 3) is therefore concerned with reporting the results of the first field test in Europe. Two important observations were made during the field operations, 1) a reduction of injectivity into the coal seam with time, considered to be caused by permeability reduction due to swelling of the coal upon CO2 exposure, and 2) low production rate of CBM, indicating slow diffusion in the coal matrix. It is concluded that understanding the transport of the gas/fluid through the coal is key to determining the success of future ECBM sites. The second part of the thesis (Chapters 4-6) is therefore dedicated to laboratory investigations of the swelling behaviour of the coal matrix, and its dependency on coal rank, moisture content, and stress state or confinement. The first type of experiment (Chapter 4 and 5) involved measurements of strain development with time at reservoir PT-conditions performed on unconfined block-shaped coal matrix fragments, exposed to CO2, methane and argon, using a high-pressure-temperature, see-through, optical cell located under a microscope. The experimental results confirmed different swelling behavior in coals exposed to different substances: carbon dioxide leads to higher strain than methane, while exposure to argon leads to very little swelling. Another result followed from the development and application of a spherical diffusion model (Chapter 5), characterized by a single valued (uniform) diffusion coefficient. The model provides a satisfactory fit to the experimental data up to the point where equilibrium is reached, and effective diffusion coefficient values were obtained that are within the range of previously published literature values. Rank effects on diffusion were expected but could not be discerned. The present experiments on moisturized samples (Chapters 4 and 5) seem to confirm the role of moisture as a competitor for adsorption sites, showing that the role of water can not be ignored in ECBM operations. The second type of experiment reported here involved measuring stress-strain development in confined, pre-pressed samples of granular bituminous coal, at reservoir PT-conditions. These experiments revealed a previously unrecognized, largely irreversible, swelling effect. We attribute the irreversible swelling phenomenon to a stress-history effect of pre-pressing. This effect may be relevant for coals that have undergone deep burial after formation, or for naturally stressed coal in tectonic zones. The thesis is concluded with a synthesis (Chapter 7) which draws together the results of both the field and laboratory tests, and with recommendations. It is inferred that ECBM offers possibilities for storing CO2 underground, but this will require that several conditions are met.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "ea04a56aeb9335245e6348ceed3f33dbc9367daf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2084175514", "DOI": "10.1080/15567249.2010.545795", "CorpusId": 155023529}, "title": "Alternative Energy Technologies for Long-term Power Generation Expansion Planning and CO2 Mitigation in Thailand", "abstract": "In 2009 electricity production in Thailand was heavily dependent on fossil fuels (more than 92.73%). Domestic natural gas fields are a plentiful energy resource but it is projected to be available only for the next decade. Using domestic natural gas would reduce national energy security. However, coal will dominate in electricity generation in Thailand due to its low price. Utilization of coal results in increasing CO2 emissions. To comply with the low-carbon society policy of the Royal Thai Government, a high target of achievement in alternative energy share of 20.40% in total energy consumption in 2022 has been proposed. The obvious answer to this challenge is to take advantage of Thailand as an agriculture-based country, especially in domestic renewable energy and clean power generation. Thailand\u2019s renewable power development plan strategy is considered by increasing the share to 2.40% in 2024. Electricity generation in this scenario is compared with future fossil-based power plants with carbon capture and storage and nuclear power in the long-term energy planning. Finally, the low carbon socity scenario for the emission abatement policy is introduced to mitigate emissions. Results are presented in total supply system cost, the incremental cost of CO2 mitigation and the co-benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation when compared to the business-as-usual scenario.

Performance and cost models of an amine (MEA)-based CO2 absorption system for post-combustion flue gas applications have been developed, and integrated with an existing power plant modeling framework that includes multipollutant control technologies for other regulated emissions. The integrated model has been applied to study the feasibility and cost of carbon capture and sequestration at both new and existing coal-burning power plants. The cost of carbon avoidance was shown to depend strongly on assumptions about the reference plant design, details of the CO2 capture system design, interactions with other pollution control systems, and method of CO2 storage. The CO2 avoidance cost for retrofit systems was found to be generally higher than for new plants, mainly because of the higher energy penalty resulting from less efficient heat integration, as well as sitespecific difficulties typically encountered in retrofit applications. For all cases, a small reduction in CO2 capture cost was afforded by the SO2 emission trading credits generated by amine-based capture systems. Efforts are underway to model a broader suite of carbon capture and sequestration technologies for more comprehensive assessments in the context of multi-pollutant environmental management.

This is due, in part, to it being a fossil fuel with associated greenhouse gas emissions, and its very poor long-term historical track record regarding gas \ufb02aring and fugitive methane and other light-hydrocarbon gas emissions. However, major environmental concerns have also arisen regarding the development of unconventional natural gas resources using hydraulic fracture stimulation, its large environmental and community impacts, water usage and potential contamination and induced seismic activity leading to increased surface impacts. There are however a number of technological opportunities identi\ufb01ed and available for deployment for a number of years that could enable the industry to improve its sustainability credentials. Seriously developing these opportunities could convince public opinion that the natural gas sector should be part of long-term plans to develop and maintain a near-zero emissions energy sector. Most of the identi\ufb01ed opportunities are obvious, such as eliminating \ufb02aring, improving production ef\ufb01ciency by gaining a better understanding of sub-surface reservoirs and \ufb02uid movements, and reducing its surface footprints, carbon capture sequestration and utilization, and more collaboration with the renewables sector to build hybrid power and energy storage plants.

The proven high efficiency circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) technology offers a solution for carbon dioxide reduction both in re-powering and in greenfield power plants. CFB technology has the advantages of a more uniform furnace heat flux, excellent fuel flexibility and offers the opportunity to further reduce carbon dioxide emissions by co-firing coal with bio-fuels. Development and design of an integrated Flexi-Burn dual-oxidant CFB boiler and balance of plant system was conducted in both air mode and oxyfuel mode. Through proper configuration and design, the same boiler can be switched from air mode to oxyfuel mode. The dual-oxidant CFB system incorporates features to maximize plant efficiency and power output when operating in the oxy-firing mode through firing more fuel in the same boiler. Existing boiler design tools are being modified to incorporate the features of oxy-combustion, so that various design options can be evaluated.

Measurements of carbon isotope variations in climate archives and isotope-enabled climate modelling foster the understanding of the carbon cycle. Perturbations in atmospheric CO2, and in its isotopic ratios (\u03b413C, \u220614C) are removed on different time scales and by partly different processes. We investigate these differences on timescales of up to 100,000 years in idealized pulse release experiments with the Bern3D-LPX Earth system model of intermediate complexity and by analytical solutions from a box model. Isotopic perturbations are initially removed much faster from the atmosphere than perturbations in CO2 as explained by aquatic carbonate chemistry. On longer time scales, the CO2 perturbation is removed by carbonate compensation and silicate rock weathering. In contrast, the \u03b413C perturbation is removed by the relentless flux of organic and calcium carbonate particles buried in sediments. The associated removal rate is significantly modified by spatial \u03b413C gradients within the ocean influencing the isotopic perturbation of the burial flux. Space-time variations in ocean \u03b413C perturbations are captured by three Principal Components and Empirical Orthogonal Functions. Analytical impulse response functions for atmospheric CO2 and \u03b413CO2 are provided. Our results show that changes in terrestrial carbon storage are unlikely the sole cause for the abrupt, centennial CO2 and \u03b413C variations recorded in ice during Heinrich Stadials HS1 and HS4 of the last glacial period. Ocean processes likely played a significant role. The \u03b4113 offset between the penultimate and last glacial maximum reconstructed for the ocean and atmosphere is most likely caused by imbalances between weathering, volcanism and burial fluxes.\n", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "0de0260ccb224b443aed327a6f2f4a92a1d9c8f1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2187747626", "CorpusId": 16943617}, "title": "Expanding the Potential for Saline Formations: Modeling Carbon Dioxide Storage, Water Extraction and Treatment for Power Plant Cooling", "abstract": "The National Water, Energy and Carbon Sequestration simulation model (WECSsim) is being developed to address the question, \" Where in the current and future U.S. fossil fuel based electricity generation fleet are there opportunities to couple CO 2 storage and extracted water use, and what are the economic and water demand-related impacts of these systems compared to traditional power systems? \" The WECSsim collaborative team initially applied this framework to a test case region in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico. Recently, the model has been expanded to incorporate the lower 48 states of the U.S. Significant effort has been spent characterizing locations throughout the U.S. where CO 2 might be stored in saline formations including substantial data collection and analysis efforts to supplement the incomplete brine data offered in the NatCarb database. WECSsim calculates costs associated with CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) for the power plant to saline formation combinations including parasitic energy costs of CO 2 capture, CO 2 pipelines, water treatment options, and the net benefit of water treatment for power plant cooling. Currently, the model can identify the least-cost deep saline formation CO 2 storage option for any current or proposed coal or natural gas-fired power plant in the lower 48 states.

The First State of the Carbon Cycle Report (SOCCR): The North American Carbon Budget and Implications for the Global Carbon Cycle", "abstract": "North America is currently a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere, contributing to the global buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and associated changes in the Earth\u2019s climate. In 2003, North America emitted nearly two billion metric tons of carbon to the atmosphere as CO2. North America\u2019s fossil-fuel emissions in 2003 (1856 million metric tons of carbon \u00b110% with 95% certainty) were 27% of global emissions. Approximately 85% of those emissions were from the United States, 9% from Canada, and 6% from Mexico. The combustion of fossil fuels for commercial energy (primarily electricity) is the single largest contributor, accounting for approximately 42% of North American fossil emissions in 2003. Transportation is the second largest, accounting for 31% of total emissions. There are also globally important carbon sinks in North America. In 2003, growing vegetation in North America removed approximately 500 million tons of carbon per year (\u00b150%) from the atmosphere and stored it as plant material and soil organic matter. This land sink is equivalent to approximately 30% of the fossil-fuel emissions from North America. The imbalance between the fossil-fuel source and the sink on land is a net release to the atmosphere of 1350 million metric tons of carbon per year (\u00b1 25%). Approximately 50% of North America\u2019s terrestrial sink is due to the regrowth of forests in the United States on former agricultural land that was last cultivated decades ago, and on timberland recovering from harvest. Other sinks are relatively small and not well quantified with uncertainties of 100% or more. The future of the North American terrestrial sink is also highly uncertain. The contribution of forest regrowth is expected to decline as the maturing forests grow more slowly and take up less CO2 from the atmosphere. But this expectation is surrounded by uncertainty because how regrowing forests and other sinks will respond to changes in climate and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is highly uncertain. The large difference between current sources and sinks and the expectation that the difference could become larger if the growth of fossil-fuel emissions continues and land sinks decline suggest that addressing imbalances in the North American carbon budget will likely require actions focused on reducing fossil-fuel emissions. Options to enhance sinks (growing forests or sequestering carbon in agricultural soils) can contribute, but enhancing sinks alone is likely insufficient to deal with either the current or future imbalance. Options to reduce emissions include efficiency improvement, fuel switching, and technologies such as carbon capture and geological storage. Implementing these options will likely require an array of policy instruments at local, regional, national, and international levels, ranging from the encouragement of voluntary actions to economic incentives, tradable emissions permits, and regulations. Meeting the demand for information by decision makers will likely require new modes of research characterized by close collaboration between scientists and carbon management stakeholders.

SynThESiS And ASSESSmEnT OF ThE nORTh AmERiCAn CARBOn BudgET Understanding the North American carbon budget, both sources and sinks, is critical to the United States Climate Change Science Program goal of providing the best possible scientific information to support public discussion, as well as government and private sector decision making, on key climate-related issues. In response, this report provides a synthesis, integration, and assessment of the current knowledge of the North American carbon budget and its context within the global carbon cycle. The report focuses on the carbon cycle as it influences the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Methane (CH4), nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gases are also relevant to climate issues, but their consideration is beyond the scope and mandate of this report. The report is organized as a response to questions relevant to carbon management and to a broad range of stakeholders charged with understanding and managing energy and land use. The questions were identified through early and continuing dialogue with these stakeholders, including scientists; decision makers in the public and private sectors, including national and sub-national government; carbon-related industries, such as energy, transportation, agriculture, and forestry; and climate policy and carbon management interest groups. The questions and the answers provided by this report are summarized below. The reader is referred to the indicated chapters for further, more detailed, discussion.

WhAT iS ThE CARBOn CyClE And Why ShOuld WE CARE? The carbon cycle, described in Chapters 1 and 2, is the combination of many different physical, chemical, and biological processes that transfer carbon between the major storage pools (known as reservoirs): the atmosphere, plants, soils, freshwater systems, oceans, and geological sediments. Hundreds of millions of years ago, and over millions of years, this carbon cycle was responsible for the formation of coal, petroleum, and natural gas, the fossil fuels that are the primary sources of energy for our modern societies. Humans have altered the Earth\u2019s carbon budget. Today, the cycling of carbon among atmosphere, land, and freshwater and marine environments is in rapid transition and out of balance. Over tens of years, the combustion of fossil fuels is releasing into the atmosphere quantities of carbon that were accumulated in the Earth system over millions of years. Furthermore, tropical forests that once held large quantities of carbon are being converted to agricultural lands, releasing additional carbon to the atmosphere as a result. Both the fossil-fuel and land-use related releases are sources of carbon to the atmosphere. The combined rate of release is far larger than can be balanced by the biological and geological processes that naturally remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it in terrestrial and marine environments as part of the Earth\u2019s carbon cycle. These processes are known as sinks. Therefore, much of the CO2 released through human activity has \u201cpiled up\u201d in the atmosphere, resulting in a dramatic increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2. The concentration increased by 31% between 1850 and 2003, and the present concentration is higher than at any time in the past 420,000 years. Because CO2 is an important greenhouse gas, the imbalance between sources and sinks and the subsequent increase in concentration in the atmosphere is very likely causing changes in Earth\u2019s climate (IPCC, 2007). Furthermore, these trends in fossil-fuel use and tropical deforestation are accelerating. The magnitude of the changes raises concerns about the future behavior of the carbon cycle. Will the carbon cycle continue to function as it has in recent history, or will a CO2-caused warming result in a weakening of the ability of sinks to take up CO2, leading to further warming? Drought, for example, may reduce forest growth. Warming can release carbon stored in soil, and warming and drought may increase forest fires. Conversely, will elevated concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere stimulate plant growth as it is known to do in laboratory and field experiments and thus strengthen global or regional sinks? The question is complicated because CO2 is not the only substance in the atmosphere that affects the Earth\u2019s surface temperature and climate. Other greenhouse gases include CH4, nitrous oxide, the halocarbons, and ozone, and all of these gases, together with water vapor, aerosols, solar radiation, and properties of the Earth\u2019s surface, are involved in the evolution of climate change. Carbon dioxide, alone, is responsible for approximately 55-60% of the change in the Earth\u2019s radiation balance due to increases in well-mixed atmospheric greenhouse gases and CH4 for about another 20% (values are for the late 1990s; with a relative uncertainty of The rate of CO2 released to the atmosphere is far larger than can be balanced by the biological and geological processes that naturally remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it in terrestrial and marine environments.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be captured and injected into subsurface reservoirs in a process known as geologic carbon sequestration (GCS). Geologic carbon sequestration in saline reservoirs offers the greatest storage capacity in the United States and worldwide. Numerical modeling offers planners a useful tool to evaluate the feasibility of GCS in saline and other reservoirs. With its database of CO2 properties, TOUGH2 and its ECO2N module is an excellent simulator for evaluating the CO2 movement in the subsurface. Radial simulations (along the r-z axis) of brine injected into a thick saline reservoir show a smooth exponential increase in pressure over time near the injection well. However, CO2 injected into a thick saline reservoir does not show the same smooth pressure increase. After some time, the pressure near the injection well levels off, remains steady, and then decreases slightly. The maximum pressure increase at the well is lower for CO2 injection than for brine injection because brine is more viscous. In addition, the maximum pressure increase occurs before the end of the CO2 injection period. Okwen et al. (2011) demonstrated this effect for fully penetrating wells and attributed this pressure response to the contrast in fluid density (native brine versus CO2) and permeability anisotropy (horizontal to vertical permeability). In this paper, we seek to demonstrate that the effect is also observed in partially penetrating wells. Partially penetrating wells are important because they offer a well design that can maximize the storage volume of the buoyant CO2 in thick reservoirs.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "4c28fca371725825e6156f8de64f2f153c9a07e0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1973513056", "DOI": "10.1063/1.4906715", "CorpusId": 108639689}, "title": "Multiscale modeling of integrated CCS systems", "abstract": "The world will continue consuming fossil fuel within the coming decades to meet its growing energy demand; however, this source must be cleaner through implementation of carbon capture, transport and storage (CCTS).

As a result, we confirmed characteristics of oxyfiring such as total heat absorption, combustion characteristics, emissions of NOx, SOx, carbon-in-ash, operational flexibility from 15MWe (50%L) to 30MWe (100%L) and behavior of injected CO2 at the injection site. Total heat absorption of the boiler under oxyfiring was 2 to 3MW higher because of decreasing heat loss in flue gas and rising temperature of boiler feed water by a flue gas cooler. NO was decomposed in the furnace under oxyfiring because flue gas was recirculated. On the other hand, reaction between SO2 and absorbent such as Ca, Mg in ash was not so active regardless of high concentrated SO2 under oxyfiring. Carbon-in-ash was almost 40%~70% in oxyfirng compared with in airfiring because of longer residence time in the furnace.

Historically, CO2 was first stored in reservoir indirectly back in 1970s during Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) process. Subsequently in 1996, the Sleipner CO2 storage project was officially implemented in Norway providing reference to future CO2 storage projects. As one of the main players in the oil and gas industries, PETRONAS has been proactive in finding an end-to-end technology development for CCS. It has recently identified the S field, a non-associated gas field, located 250km Offshore Sarawak Malaysia as a potential pilot hydrocarbon production and CO2 storage gas field one of the strategic technology pilot project to mature both surface and subsurface technologies. The S field, a carbonate build up platform is considered heterogeneous type of reservoir with porosity ranging from 15% to 40% and permeability ranging from 10md to 1300md. The S field contains 70% CO2 gas contents with some amount of impurities, N2, H2S and Hg. As a baseline development strategy to support this technology project, pure CO2 injection was considered, taking into account the separation technology efficiency to separate CO2 from other contaminants gas back into the same reservoir aquifer. However, due to some limitation on the surface technologies, traces of impurities might be present in the system. There is a possibility of CO2 being co-injected with other impurities, such as H2S. The presence of H2S in the injected CO2 stream need to be evaluated and quantified to ensure the storage plan is not affected. Changes in base CO2 solubility may ultimately affect storage integrity and capacity. Understanding the impact of H2S impurity on CO2 solubility in brine is one of the key parameters to ensure successful any CO2 sequestration project. To understand this effect, an extensive laboratory experiments on CO2 solubility has been conducted to quantify the impact of H2S (up to 5% level of H2S concentration) to the system.

The principle is to capture the produced CO2 from heavy industrial sources and securely store it into deep geological formations. Since the purpose is to permanently remove the stored CO2 from the carbon cycle, therefore it is important to improve the understanding of the processes and develop confidence in long-term carbon storage performance. The free phase CO2 tends to migrate upwards and lies beneath the caprock, due to buoyancy from its low density. Therefore the structural geometry of the seal plays a significant role in the plume migration and trapping mechanism. Various mechanisms stop the CO2 from further migration such as dissolution and residual trapping, which are detected by numerical simulations (Ennis-King et al., 2005) and also by structural closures, stratigraphic pitchouts and hydrodynamic traps which are detectible while making the geological modelling (Bachu et al., 1994). In real cases and in scales of tens of kilometers, the topography changes more, and the caprock structure is identified by domes and anticlines (Gasda et al., 2012) which are in a seismic observation range of 10m (Jackson et al., 2010). The topography variation below 10m is called rugosity, which is not evident in seismic investigations but can be detected using LiDAR scanning of outcrops and geostatistical earth models (Jones et al., 2009; Pringle et al., 2010; Newell and Shariatipour 2016). This study looks at the impact of small and large scale topographical changes at the caprock-reservoir interface on the residual, structural and dissolution trapping mechanisms.

MRST (MATLAB Reservoir Simulation Toolkit) is developed by the computational geoscience group within the applied mathematics groups at SINTEF ICT (Bao et al., 2017). Vertical equilibrium models is assumed in both sets of simulation. Under this assumption, CO2 plume flow in 3D can be approximated in terms of its thickness to obtain a 2D simulation model which consequently decreases the computational costs. In comparison to the time period in which the lateral migration is being investigated, the CO2 and resident brine are separated quickly and form two separate layers. 1.

Unfortunately, the increased amount of anthropogenic carbon emitted during the energy production leads to environmental issues, including climate change. Thus, reducing carbon dioxide emissions in order to stabilize atmospheric CO2 levels is crucial, and this would not be achieved without significant changes in the energy conversion processes and the implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Currently, the geological storage of carbon dioxide is considered to be the most economical method of carbon sequestration, while mineral carbonation is a relatively new and less explored method of sequestering CO2. The advantage of carbon mineral sequestration is that it is the most permanent and safe method of carbon storage, since the gaseous carbon dioxide is fixed into a solid matrix of Mgbearing minerals (e.g., serpentine) forming a thermodynamically stable solid product. The current drawback of carbon mineral sequestration is its relatively high cost. Therefore, this study focuses on tailored synthesis of high purity precipitated magnesium carbonate (PMC) to mimic commercially available CaCO3-based filler materials, while sequestering CO2.

First, as the oil and gas industry is facing increasing regulation, there is a need to put more control in the industrial process and to assess the impact on the marine environment. The applications are diverse, including: early warnings of \"blow-out\" from offshore installations, detection of leaks from underwater gas pipelines, gas leakage detection from Carbon and Capture and Storage facilities (a process aimed at mitigating the release of large quantities of CO2 in the atmosphere), and seabed monitoring. Second, this technology has a role to play in oceanography for a better understanding of natural occurrences of gas release from the sea floor such as methane seeps. This is of major importance for the assessment of the exchange of gas between the ocean and the atmosphere with application to global warming. All those phenomena involve the formation and release of bubbles of different sizes. These are strong sources and scatterers of sound. Within this context, this thesis draws on a two part study. The first part experimentally addresses the accuracy of a passive acoustic inversion method for the quantification of gas release. Such a technique offers the advantage of lower power requirements for long term monitoring. It is common practice for researchers to identify single bubble injection events from time histories or time frequency representations of hydrophone data, and infer bubble sizes from the centre frequency of the emission. This is well suited for gas release at a low flow rate, involving solitary bubble release. However, for larger events, with overlapping of bubble acoustic emissions, the inability to discriminate each individual bubble injection events makes this approach inappropriate. Using an inverse method based on the spectrum of the acoustic emissions allows quantification of such releases with good accuracy. The inverse scheme is tested using data collected in a large test tank and data collected at sea during the QICS (Quantifying Impacts of Carbon Storage) project.The second part of the thesis addresses the problem of quantifying gas releases using active acoustics. Single beam echosounders are commonly used instruments in fisheries acoustics. When investigating gas release from the seafloor, they are frequently employed to study the spatial distribution of the gas releases. However, few studies make use of these data to quantify the amount of gas being released. Here, using the common multi-frequency ability of these systems, an inverse method aimed at determining gas volumes is developed. This is tested against simulated data and the method shows good performances in scenarios with limited data sets (data collected at limited number of frequencies). Then, using data collected at sea from methane seeps to the west of Svalbard (from two research cruises), the method is applied and compared to independent measurements of gas fluxes.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "735d1dc1fa9f5a52b9d8140b970c108a7cb5a37b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2055810109", "DOI": "10.4067/S0718-58392013000400010", "CorpusId": 85328917}, "title": "Soil organic carbon storage and dynamics after C3-C4and C4-C3vegetation changes in sub-Andean landscapes of Colombia", "abstract": "The soil C capture capacity and organic matter turnover rate vary\naccording to photosynthetic pathways; therefore the evaluation of C at\nsites suffering changes from C3 to C4 vegetation and vice versa, is\nimportant to identify impacts of land use change on C cycle.

This is probably the main reason why the obvious choice to counteract climate change has been overlooked so long, namely to help mother nature to do what it has always been doing. A novel way of using olivine against climate change is proposed, not as a chemical in a technology, but in the same way it works in nature. Chemical weathering of olivine and other calcium and magnesium silicates has always been the main mechanism to keep the C0 2 levels of the atmosphere within reasonable bounds, with storage of organic carbon a distant second. At present this mechanism cannot cope with the increased input of C0 2 caused by the burning of fossil fuels. In order to reach a new balance we must increase the rate of weathering as well. This can be done by mining abundant rock types that weather easily, grind them, and spread the powder in a thin veneer over large areas in wet tropical climates, where weathering rates are highest. The reaction that is relevant to combat climate change is the transformation of C0 2 into the bicarbonate in solution. Ultimately these bicarbonate solutions will reach the oceans and precipitate as carbonate sediments, but this is a slow process which extends well beyond the time span of concern.

In this respect, the aim of this study is to evaluate the life cycle water use of oxy-fuel CO capture, transport and storage via a 600 MW coal fired oxy-fuel power plant in China.

Sensitivity analysis is performed in this research and indicates that the variation of tap water use affects the water intensity immensely. Furthermore, the use of the membrane method for air separation decreases the overall water use 14.21% respectively.

The study commenced with a survey of the current CO 2 situation in the pulp and paper industry. The different CO 2 reduction, capture, storage and utilization options were investigated. Mineral carbonation and its potential for CO 2 sequestration in Finland were further explored and preliminary experiments were conducted to set the scene for mineral carbonation in industrial processes. The pulp and paper industry accounts for approximately 15% of the fossil fuel derived carbon dioxide emissions in Finland. Heat and power generation and use of fossil fuels in processes are the most significant sources of CO 2 emissions in the forest industry. Improving energy efficiency, switching to non-fossil energy sources, lowering energy consumption and improving power-to-heat ratio are examples of ways to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions at pulp and paper mills. Carbon dioxide can be captured, stored and sometimes used in another process or product so that it does not reach the atmosphere. Capture technologies are mainly based on absorption, adsorption, cryogenics and membranes. The primary alternatives for long-term CO 2 disposal are underground storage, ocean sequestration and storing carbon dioxide as inert solids. The captured CO 2 can be used in various industrial applications such as pH control and brownstock washing. Mineral carbonation appears to be the best option for long-term storage in Finland if the kinetics of the reaction can be improved. The Finnish pulp and paper mills are large point emitting sources with long annual operating times and are therefore suitable for CO 2 capture. The captured CO 2 would be transported to the carbonation facility by a pipeline. Based on the emissions and locations of individual pulp and paper mills, a tentative plan for a CO 2 grid was drawn up.

Dissociation of hydrate towards under saturated fluid phases involves the same level of contraction. Hydrate phase transitions are generally fast (scales of seconds) compared to mineral dissolution and precipitation and it is unlikely that a time shifted explicit coupling to geo mechanical analysis will be able to capture the appropriate dynamic couplings between flow and changes in stress. The need for geo mechanical integrity of the storage site therefore requires a reservoir simulator with an implicit solution of mass flow, heat flow and geo mechanics. And since carbon dioxide involved in hydrate is also involved in different geochemical reactions we propose a scheme where all possible hydrate formation (on water/carbon dioxide interface, from water solution and from carbon dioxide adsorbed on mineral surfaces) as well as all different possible dissociations are treated as pseudo reactions but with kinetics derived from advanced theoretical modelling. The main tools for generating these models have been phase field theory simulations, with thermodynamic properties derived from molecular modelling. The detailed results from these types of simulations provides information on the relative impact of mass transport, heat transport and thermodynamics of the phase transition which enable qualified simplifications for implementation into RCB.

Specifically, within this IMOGEN-JULES framework, we focus on and characterise the global and regional effectiveness of land-based (BECCS and/or\u00a0AR) and anthropogenic methane\u00a0( CH4 ) emission mitigation, separately and in combination, on the anthropogenic fossil fuel carbon dioxide\u00a0( CO2 ) emission budgets\u00a0(AFFEBs) to\u00a02100. We use consistent data and socio-economic assumptions from the IMAGE integrated assessment model for the second Shared Socioeconomic Pathway\u00a0(SSP2). The analysis includes the effects of the methane and carbon\u2013climate feedbacks from wetlands and permafrost thaw, which we have shown previously to be significant constraints on the AFFEBs. Globally, mitigation of anthropogenic CH4 emissions has large impacts on the anthropogenic fossil fuel emission budgets, potentially offsetting (i.e.\u00a0allowing extra) carbon dioxide emissions of 188\u2013212\u2009Gt\u2009C. This is because of (a)\u00a0the reduction in the direct and indirect radiative forcing of methane in response to the lower emissions and hence atmospheric concentration of methane and (b)\u00a0carbon-cycle changes leading to increased uptake by the land and ocean by CO2 -based fertilisation. Methane mitigation is beneficial everywhere, particularly for the major CH4 -emitting regions of India, the USA, and China. Land-based mitigation has the potential to offset 51\u2013100\u2009Gt\u2009C globally, the large range reflecting assumptions and uncertainties associated with BECCS. The ranges for CH4 reduction and BECCS implementation are valid for both the 1.5\u00a0and 2\u2009 \u2218 C warming targets. That is the mitigation potential of the CH4 and of the land-based scenarios is similar for regardless of which of the final stabilised warming levels society aims for. Further, both the effectiveness and the preferred land management strategy (i.e. AR\u00a0or BECCS) have strong regional dependencies. Additional analysis shows extensive BECCS could adversely affect water security for several regions. Although the primary requirement remains mitigation of fossil fuel emissions, our results highlight the potential for the mitigation of CH4 emissions to make the Paris climate targets more achievable.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "e58e6d1ed487b8f8406e2f4321902c07958a9886", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1976752557", "DOI": "10.1007/S13132-010-0014-7", "CorpusId": 153881359}, "title": "Public Energy R&D Priorities in Small EU Member States: Evidence from Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands", "abstract": "This article investigates energy R&D specialisation in Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands. The analysis is made taking into consideration the correlation between energy balances, public energy R&D spending and long-term energy policy objectives. Special attention is directed towards the prospective of developing cleaner forms of energy production. Governments in the European Union are increasingly accepting the implications of climate change and taking measures to transform their economies to a low carbon future. In this context, energy research development and demonstration (RD&D) are important policy instruments to meet national energy and climate policy objectives. Long-term public investments in RD&D play a central role in achieving these goals. It suggests that despite an increase in recent years, the three selected countries award a relatively low importance to energy research. When looking at research areas which receive public funding, it emerges that renewable energy and energy efficiency are highly prioritised, when compared to other areas such as fossil and nuclear energy. In all three countries, biomass research in particular is awarded extensive importance. It appears that changing preferences in society (relative to the incumbent need to reduce green house gases) are driving the political priorities towards funding more climate-friendly energy technologies. The three countries remain, to a large extent, dependent on fossil fuels in their energy balance. The paper concludes that increased attention on new renewable energy source and carbon capture and storage is needed if policy makers are determined in their intentions to direct their societies towards a low carbon future.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "407055d1450b5e5c1cd54a741381c2b87f360a21", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2077391078", "DOI": "10.1109/MSPEC.2013.6545129", "CorpusId": 110931387}, "title": "Fighting coal to a draw [Data Flow]", "abstract": "Renewables are making progress, but not enough to dent emissions.

The results indicate that the compound real options approach has an advantage over both the traditional net present value (NPV) and single\u2010option method when handling multistage investments. Although the present carbon price level is not high enough to encourage CCS investment, the critical carbon price will decrease when considering the upside potential inherent in the CCS investment. Further analyses indicate that the timing of the second phase of a CCS project and other factors will also affect the critical carbon price and the value of a CCS investment. These findings will be useful for decision making associated with CCS investment, and related policy making in an uncertain environment. \u00a9 2018 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "cd1d067fc31c9d0b505293f891d90dcc6a8789fb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3164777032", "DOI": "10.2139/SSRN.3815113", "CorpusId": 236665414}, "title": "Communicating site technical, permitting and planning readiness for CO2 storage operations using the ALIGN-CCUS framework of Storage Readiness Levels", "abstract": "CO2 Storage Readiness Levels are presented to communicate those storage site technical appraisal, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project planning and permitting activities that have been completed, and what remains to be achieved for a CO2 storage site to become operational.
