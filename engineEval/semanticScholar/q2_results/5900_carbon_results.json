The Hot-CAP features a concentrated carbonate solution (e.g., K{sub 2}CO{sub 3}) for CO{sub 2} absorption and a bicarbonate slurry (e.g., KHCO{sub 3}) for high-pressure CO{sub 2} stripping to overcome the energy use and other disadvantages associated with the benchmark monoethanolamine (MEA) process. The project was aimed at performing laboratory- and bench-scale experiments to prove its technical feasibility and generate process engineering and scale-up data, and conducting a techno-economic analysis (TEA) to demonstrate its energy use and cost competitiveness over MEA. To meet project goals and objectives, a combination of experimental, modeling, process simulation, and economic analysis studies were applied. Carefully designed and intensive experiments were conducted to measure thermodynamic and reaction engineering data relevant to four major unit operations in the Hot-CAP (i.e., CO{sub 2} absorption, CO{sub 2} stripping, bicarbonate crystallization, and sulfate reclamation). The rate promoters that could accelerate the CO{sub 2} absorption rate into the potassium carbonate/bicarbonate (PCB) solution to a level greater than that into the 5 M MEA solution were identified, and the superior performancemore\u00a0\u00bb of CO{sub 2} absorption into PCB was demonstrated in a bench-scale packed-bed column. Kinetic data on bicarbonate crystallization were developed and applied for crystallizer design and sizing. Parametric testing of high-pressure CO{sub 2} stripping with concentrated bicarbonate-dominant slurries at high temperatures ({>=}140{degrees}C) in a bench-scale stripping column demonstrated lower heat use than with MEA. The feasibility of a modified process for combining SO{sub 2} removal with CO{sub 2} capture was preliminarily demonstrated. In addition to the experimental studies, the technical challenges pertinent to fouling of slurry-handling equipment and the design of the crystallizer and stripper were addressed through consultation with vendors and engineering analyses. A process flow diagram of the Hot-CAP was then developed and a TEA was performed to compare the energy use and cost performance of a nominal 550-MWe subcritical pulverized coal (PC)-fired power plant without CO{sub 2} capture (DOE/NETL Case 9) with the benchmark MEA-based post-combustion CO{sub 2} capture (PCC; DOE/NETL Case 10) and the Hot-CAP-based PCC. The results revealed that the net power produced in the PC + Hot-CAP is 609 MWe, greater than the PC + MEA (550 MWe). The 20-year levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the PC + Hot-CAP, including CO{sub 2} transportation and storage, is 120.3 mills/kWh, a 60% increase over the base PC plant without CO{sub 2} capture. The LCOE increase for the Hot-CAP is 29% lower than that for MEA. TEA results demonstrated that the Hot-CAP is energy-efficient and cost-effective compared with the benchmark MEA process.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "d330b2d020a4ed4805c99725fae3cf467d2fa103", "externalIds": {"MAG": "238265502", "DOI": "10.2172/960197", "CorpusId": 107727265}, "title": "DOE FY 2010 Budget Request and Recovery Act Funding for Energy Research, Development, Demonstration, and Deployment: Analysis and Recommendations", "abstract": "The combination of the FY 2010 budget request for the Department of Energy (DOE) and the portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) funds likely to be available in 2010 would (assuming that they would be split evenly between FY 2010 and FY 2011) result in a doubling in funding available for energy research, development, and deployment (ERD and D) from $3.6 billion in FY 2009 to $7.2 billion in FY 2010. Without the stimulus funds, DOE ERD and D investments in FY 2010 would decrease very slightly when compared to FY 2009. Excluding the $7.5 billion for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loans in FY 2009, the FY 2010 budget request for deployment represents a 33 percent decrease from the FY 2009 levels from $520 million to $350 million. This decrease is largely due to the large amounts of funds appropriated in ARRA for DOE deployment programs, or $23.6 billion, which are three times greater than those appropriated in the FY 2009 budget. These very substantial funding amounts, coupled with the broad range of institutional innovations the administration is putting in place and movement toward putting a price on carbon emissions, will help accelerate innovation for a broad range of energy technologies. DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and the Energy Innovation Hubs are important initiatives that could contribute to two weak points of the government's energy innovation effort, namely funding high-risk projects in transformational technologies and in companies that have not traditionally worked with the government and strengthening the integration of basic and applied research in priority areas. Increasing the funding for different types of energy storage research, providing some support for exploring opportunities in coal-to-liquids with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and coal-and-biomass-to-liquids with CCS, and reducing funding for fission RD and D are other actions that Congress could take in the short-term. Energy storage may play a crucial role in the future of the power and transportation systems, which together consume two thirds of primary energy in the United States. A recent National Academy of Science report recommended carrying out detailed scenario assessments of the penetration of unconventional fuels from coal and coal and biomass with CCS. And the research plan provided for nuclear fission does not justify spending as many funds as were requested. The proposed funding for FY 2010 and the resources from ARRA, however, do not guarantee that the United States will finally enjoy the predictable and consistent publicly-funded energy technology innovation effort that it needs. The Obama administration must put in place a comprehensive energy technology innovation strategy that will ensure that an expanded ERD3 effort is both sustainable and efficient. This commission would be charged with, inter alia, developing a strategy that optimizes the integration of the various stages of innovation (research, development, demonstration, early deployment), as well as integrates efforts across technology areas.

There are various capturing principles, whereas to date most of the pilot plants are based on amine absorption. One commonly used primary amine is monoethanolamine (MEA). During the process of carbon capture, the solvent is subject to various degradation mechanisms due to oxidation, thermal strain, and unwanted side reactions within the system. After reclaiming the usable solvent for recycling, these degradation products accumulate as waste and need to be treated accordingly. Depending on the solvent, different degradation products may be found in this so called reclaimer waste, with ammonia as a dominant end product. Volatile products may also be emitted through the exhaust gas. Estimates from a full-scale amine-based capture plant predicts approximately 0.2 ppm amine and 20 ppm ammonia in the emissions. For a full-scale capture plant removing 1 million tons CO2 annually, these concentrations implicate emissions of significant environmental impact. Effluents from those various sources within the capture plant can be treated biologically to obtain nitrogen removal as well as general detoxification. Our studies have shown that MEA, as well as MEA-based reclaimer waste, can be treated with biological nitrogen removal, which is a well-established method within the field of wastewater treatment.

This paper provides a techno-economic assessment of an industrial-scale calcium looping (CaL) process with simultaneous TCES and CO2 capture. The process is assumed to make profit by selling dispatchable electricity and by providing CO2 capture services to a certain nearby emitter (i.e., transport and storage of CO2 are not accounted). Thus, the process is connected to two other facilities located nearby: a renewable non-dispatchable energy source that charges the storage and a plant from which the CO2 in its flue gas flow is captured while discharging the storage and producing dispatchable electricity. The process, which offers the possibility of long-term storage at ambient temperature without any significant energy loss, is herein sized for a given daily energy input under certain boundary conditions, which mandate that the charging section runs steadily for one 12-h period per day and that the discharging section can provide a steady output during 24 h per day. Intercoupled mass and energy balances of the process are computed for the different process elements, followed by the sizing of the main process equipment, after which the economics of the process are computed through cost functions widely used and validated in literature. The economic viability of the process is assessed through the breakeven electricity price (BESP), payback period (PBP), and as cost per ton of CO2 captured. The cost of the renewable energy is excluded from the study, although its potential impact on the process costs if included in the system is assessed. The sensitivities of the computed costs to the main process and economic parameters are also assessed. The results show that for the most realistic economic projections, the BESP ranges from 141 to \u221220 $/MWh for different plant sizes and a lifetime of 20 years.

The study employed a combination method of experiments and numerical simulation to investigate the dissolution mechanism and impact factors of CO2 in these saline aquifers. The results showed (1) CO2 solubility in different types of water chemistry were shown in ascending order: MgCl2-type water < CaCl2-type water < Na2SO4-type water < NaCl-type water < Na2CO3-type water < distilled water. These results were consistent with the calculated results undertaken by TOUGHREACT with about 5% margin of error. CO2 solubility of Shiqianfeng Fm. saline was 1.05\u00a0mol/L; (2) compared with distilled water, the more complex the water\u2019s chemical composition, the greater the increase in HCO3\u2212concentration. While the water\u2019s composition was relatively simple, the tested water\u2019s HCO3\u2212concentrations were in close accord with the calculated value undertaken by the TOUGHREACT code, and the more complex the water\u2019s composition, the poorer the agreement was, probably due to the complex and unstable HCO3\u2212 complicating matters when in an aqueous solution system including both tested HCO3\u2212concentration and calculated HCO3\u2212concentration; (3) the CO2 solubility in the saline at the temperature conditions of 55\u00a0\u00b0C and 70\u00a0\u00b0C were 1.17 and 1.02\u00a0mol/L. When compared with the calculated value of 1.20 and 1.05\u00a0mol/L, they were almost the same with only 1 and 3% margin of error; concentrations of HCO3\u2212 were 402.73\u00a0mg/L (0.007\u00a0mol/L) and 385.65\u00a0mg/L (0.006\u00a0mol/L), while the simulation results were 132.16\u00a0mg/L (0.002\u00a0mol/L) and 128.52\u00a0mg/L (0.002\u00a0mol/L). From the contrast between the tested data and the calculated data undertaken by the TOUGHREACT code, it was shown that TOUGHRACT code could better simulate the interaction between saline and CO2 in the dissolution sequestration capacity. Therefore, TOUGHREACT code could be used for the inter-process prediction of CO2 long-term geological storage of CO2; (4) The Ca2+ concentration and SO42\u2212concentration in saline water had less effect on the solubility of CO2 and HCO3\u2212concentration. In addition, TDS and pH values of saline affected not only the solubility of CO2, but also the conversion of CO2 to HCO3\u2212 due to that they can affect the activity and acid-base balance. So in fact, we just need to consider that the TDS and pH values are main impact factors in the dissolution sequestration capacity of CO2 geological sequestration in deep saline aquifers.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "f65486fc7990740574aad08a21b4128f9664ec21", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1814669775", "DOI": "10.1190/1.3167780", "CorpusId": 128379604}, "title": "Introduction to this special section Unconventional resources and CO2 monitoring", "abstract": "Have you heard the news?

However, the amount of natural gas flared globally has been shown to contribute approximately 1.2% of the global CO2 emissions, which is given to be more than one-half of the certified emissions reductions under the Kyoto Protocol (ICF International 2006). There are several technologies and techniques now available for separation of CO2 (or acid gases) from gas mixture, either as flue gas from power plants or from natural gas. In addition to deployment of these technologies, the captured or separated CO2 must be disposed of in such a manner as to prevent it from seeping back into the atmosphere. This is required to achieve the aims of the CDM from the use of fossil fuels. Among the fossil fuels, natural gas has been shown to contain the least amount of CO2 emitted per tonnage of fuel burnt as compared with coal and oil. In addition to the CO2 emitted during combustion, natural gas on production also contains a certain amount of impurities, including CO2 gas. The maximum level of CO2 permitted in natural-gas fuel is typically less than 3%. Hence, all natural gas is treated to remove the solids and free liquids and to reduce water-vapor content to acceptable levels and, especially, to meet pipeline specifications. Hence, natural gas must be purified through the removal of CO2 and other acid gases and impurities (where present) because these impurities can form acids in the presence of water to corrode pipelines and other equipment. In addition, higher concentrations of CO2 in natural gas reduce the heating value or energy level, which is below pipeline specifications, necessitating its removal before distribution to the end consumer. Natural gas has been a main source in meeting the world\u2019s energy demand, contributing an estimated 23.81% in 2010 to the world energy supply mix (Rufford et al. 2012, page 123). This contribution is projected to increase because natural gas is considered the cleaner fossil fuel compared with coal and oil. The deployment of appropriate CO2-capture technology in processing natural gas stands to improve its value as the cleaner fossil fuel.

One potential solution to this interrelated problem is the idea to capture the carbon dioxide (CO2) from large stationary emission sources, such as power plants, and permanently store it deep underground. In this way CO2 emissions can be prevented from reaching the atmosphere, whilst allowing for a continued use of fossil fuels, until other alternatives (i.e. wind, solar, biomass) are developed on a wider scale. This process is also referred to as carbon capture and storage (CCS). The literature review in this thesis identifies the need to present a more in-depth picture of the entire process of governance of CO2 storage. \n The aim of this research is therefore to examine the extent to which the current legal and regulatory frameworks are able to mediate between managing the environmental risks of CO2 storage and the development/deployment of CCS in Europe. The analysis is underlined by the governance network theory (GNT), borrowing also elements from the theory of bounded rationality. Along with an extensive doctrinal legal scholarship, data analysis is also supported by 15 in-depth interviews with key CCS stakeholders in Europe. The results show that there is a wide consensus that the current legal and regulatory frameworks are robust enough, albeit the existence of uncertainty in regards to a number of legal provisions. There is also wide agreement between stakeholders in regards to the ability of operators to manage the environmental risks of CO2 storage. The discussion of these results show the applicability of the GNT as a framework for studying the management of environmental risks of CO2 storage, and the development and deployment of CCS technology in conjunction. Implications drawn from these findings also show that the management of environmental risks of CO2 storage and the future of CCS technology depends heavily on the effective relationship between the government agencies (i.e. competent authority) and project developers. Furthermore, good communication and engagement with other stakeholders, in particular the general public, will also be significant in the future development/deployment of CCS projects in Europe. When these relationships are good, this research argues that efficiency gains of governance are realised.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "4805b0108d9627f314ca6f1bdd99276b1d0ab05b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "34424495", "CorpusId": 54582959}, "title": "Redesign of plant production systems for Australian landscapes", "abstract": "While rural production has played a major role in Australia\u2019s economic development, it has had a profoundly detrimental impact on the quality of land and water resources. Australia\u2019s geological history has created a unique, ancient, very flat continent that has accumulated enormous amounts of salts in the soils, regolith, lakes and groundwater. Most of our rivers and groundwater systems are sluggish, with only a small capacity to move salt from the continent. Thus, our farming systems must be able to work in a landscape that is old, flat, salty and driven by a dry, highly variable climate. Unfortunately, most of our European style of agriculture, pastures and annual crops is ill suited to this landscape. The resulting land and water damage is well documented. Much of the degradation is the consequence of agro-ecosystems that leak carbon, water and nutrients. This poses a major challenge for agronomy and soil science: to find plant production systems that can capture this waste and turn it into wealth creating products and ecosystem services as part of the development of a new rural landscape. To achieve this goal, soil science and agronomy will need to lift its gaze beyond the crop plot, soil profile pit to the dynamics of soil and plant community processes at the scale of catchments and landscapes. Background and matters of principle Soil/plant function is central to ecosystem function and ecological sustainability. Soil is a seething foundry in which matter and energy are in constant flux as it provides the support services for ecosystem primary production. A rich mix of mineral particles, biota, organic matter, gases, water and nutrients, soil constitutes a self-regulating biological factory essential for initiation and maintenance of life. Soil/plant interactions determine the partitioning of rainfall, snowmelt or irrigation into overland flow, infiltration, storage, and deep drainage and, in turn, groundwater recharge. The way soil accepts, stores, and transmits water and associated solute, strongly influences the nature of rivers, springs, lakes and wetlands. Organisms in soil recycle residues, converting them to nutrients and other compounds, thereby providing the primary cleaning and recycling function for ecosystems. This critical role of soil/plant interaction in ecosystem and landscape function has rarely been the focus of soil science and agronomy. Much of both disciplines have been directed to serving a single production focus in agriculture. This is reflected in the fact that most soil science and agronomy departments at our universities have been historically married to agriculture, with only fleeting connections with ecology and the earth sciences. Few have been formally associated with ecology, ecosystem studies or earth science, although a trend towards association with natural resource management is increasing. In the move towards ecologically sustainable development over the past decade there has been a clear recognition that this single, very narrow focus on agricultural production has led to degradation of the natural resource and the environment. There is now increasing awareness that ecologically sustainable land and water management requires a shift to an ecological approach that studies agricultural production in the agroecosystem in which it is cast within the broader landscape. Soil/plant interaction and function are fundamental to ecosystem health and environmental quality. It is therefore imperative that the soil science and agronomy community moves its attention to increasing knowledge and understanding of these lifesustaining processes in the soil, the catchment and the landscape. The challenge before agricultural scientists is to direct their thinking and effort to the processes in the soil/plant system that are critical to a better understanding of ecosystem function as a basis for more sustainable management of Australia\u2019s land and water resources. In this way, soil science and agronomy can play a key role in providing the scientific knowledge urgently required for more sustainable management of our ecosystems in the Australian landscape.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "bac58a7276b9801753815846cac86dbbdf20347b", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "8385709", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.iecr.1c01174", "CorpusId": 237370921, "PubMed": "34475634"}, "title": "Sustainable Hydrates for Enhanced Carbon Dioxide Capture from an Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle in a Fixed Bed Reactor", "abstract": "An increase in temperature of up to 2 \u00b0C occurs when the amount of CO2 reaches a range of 450 ppm. The permanent use of mineral oil is closely related to CO2 emissions. Maintaining the sustainability of fossil fuels and eliminating and reducing CO2 emissions is possible through carbon capture and storage (CCS) processes. One of the best ways to maintain CCS is hydrate-based gas separation. Selected type T1-5 (0.01 mol % sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) + 5.60 mol % tetrahydrofuran (THF), with the help of this silica gel promotion was strongly stimulated. A pressure of 36.5 bar of CO2 is needed in H2O to investigate the CO2 hydrate formation. Therefore, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether (EGME at 0.10 mol %) along with SDS (0.01 mol %) labeled as T1A-2 was used as an alternative to THF at the comparable working parameters in which CO2 uptake of 5.45 mmol of CO2/g of H2O was obtained. Additionally, it was found that with an increase in tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) supplementation of CO2, the hydrate and operating capacity of the process increased. When the bed height was reduced from 3 cm to 2 cm with 0.1 mol % TBAB and 0.01% SDS (labelled as T3-2) in fixed bed reactor (FBR), the outcomes demonstrated a slight expansion in gas supply to 1.54 mmol of CO2/g of H2O at working states of 283 K and 70 bar. The gas selectivity experiment by using the high-pressure volume analysis through hydrate formation was performed in which the highest CO2 uptake for the employment of silica contacts with water in fuel gas mixture was observed in the non-IGCC conditions. Thus, two types of reactor configurations are being proposed for changing the process from batch to continuous with the employment of macroporous silica contacts with new consolidated promoters to improve the formation of CO2 hydrate in the IGCC conditions. Later, much work should be possible on this with an assortment of promoters and specific performance parameters.

Even with its unprecedented growth, the question of security is also of paramount concern among the users of cloud services. There is a huge demand for new protocols and tools in order to enhance and assess the security strength of its service. Notwithstanding the present methods used for encrypting the files in cloud they are not highly efficient. Hence this enhanced technique is proposed to overcome all these challenges and improve the environmental benefits. In this method, initially the authentication of the user is verified. Once the authentication of the user is verified successfully dual encryption is performed on the cloud stored files using ElGamal cryptosystem and Hyper Elliptical Curve Cryptography (HECC). The aim for using the proposed system is for analysis of security which can be enhanced through the technique of sharing many keys amongst the two parties. Integer selection is an important attribute which defines the proper security to the cloud storage. For ensuring high security, this integer selection is performed by utilizing BAT algorithm. After the encryption, the suggested technique uses the HECC algorithm. In HECC, key generation is done by point addition and point doubling based elliptic curve cryptography. The dual encryption in this method provides efficient security to the cloud data. The proposed technique performance is evaluated in reference with environmental protection, storage cost, computation cost and execution time and is implemented in JAVA. The experimental results show the efficacy of the system as it utilizes only less time for both encryption and decryption of sensitive data.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "27f1c3f1884438ca4fb447cd03d5902da6346df2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1969712471", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.20140100", "CorpusId": 129301213}, "title": "MVA Techniques and Application at the Citronelle SECARB Phase III site, Alabama", "abstract": "The Southeast Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership Anthropogenic Test at Southern Company\u2019s Plant Berry 25MW Post-combustion CO2 Capture Unit is the largest, active, fully-integrated commercial prototype coal-fired carbon capture and storage projects in the USA.

In this paper, we investigate the core-scale numerical model presented by Golfier et al. (J. Fluid Mecha., 2002), which uses the Darcy-Brinkman-Stokes (DBS) flow formulation. This model uses a simplified Kozeny-Carmen formulation and a simplified linear formulation to describe the evolution of permeability and mass exchange coefficient as a function of porosity at the core-scale, respectively. This assumption is equivalent to neglecting the impact of pore-scale non-uniform dissolution on the prediction of the dissolution processes overall behavior. However, recent pore-scale dissolution studies have observed many different dissolution regimes, which calls into question the accuracy of the assumptions in Golfier et al. (2002) \u2019s model. To investigate the legitimacy of this assumption, we first used our inhouse pore-scale numerical simulator (GeoChemFoam) to observe the dissolution in the uniform and dominant wormhole regimes at the pore-scale, and then developed representative permeability (K) and mass exchange coefficient (\u03b1) relations derived from the pore-scale models and applied them to the corescale model.

The thesis consists of two parts. In the first part, by using the concept of exergy, a framework was constructed through which the practicality (feasibility) of an energy conversion/extraction method can be systematically evaluated. This framework, based on exergy analysis and cumulative degree of perfection, is described by analyzing a low emission underground coal gasification (UCG) process. For the evaluation of energy conversion processes we introduce a new concept, viz. recovery factor, which is a better indicator of the exergetic viability of a conversion process than the traditionally used efficiency factors. In the second part, various issues related to the aquifer storage of CO2 are studied. Aquifer storage is considered as an option for low emission fossil fuel utilization. Each chapter is summarized as follows: In chapter 2, various options are considered to reduce CO2 emissions when utilizing deep coal by applying UCG, i.e., (1) in combination with carbonation of synthetic minerals (CaO), (2) conventional UCG followed by ex-situ separation of CO2 and (3) upgrading the product gas using naturally occurring minerals (wollastonite). A chemical equilibrium model was used to analyze the effect of the process parameters on product composition and use it for an exergy (useful energy) analysis. The result is presented in terms of theoretical (ideal unit operations), practical (state of the art technology), and zero-emission (applying current CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) to all sources of CO2 emission) recovery factors. The results show that underground gasification of deep coal can optimally extract 52-68 % of the coal chemical exergy, but zero-emission extraction gives a negative recovery factor, indicating that it is not practical with the current state of the art CCS technology. Using in-situ CaO, which will enhance the H2 production, is theoretically feasible with a recovery factor around 80%, but is not exergetically feasible with the current state of technology, i.e. with a negative practical recovery factor. Ex-situ upgrading of the conventional UCG product gas with wollastonite is exergetically feasible for both practical and zero-emission cases according to the equilibrium model. Slow attainment of chemical equilibrium makes its application questionable. In chapter 3, based on recent successful low-pressure underground coal gasification pilot experiments that use alternating injection of air (oxygen) and steam, a mathematical model is written to evaluate the potential of alternating injection UCG in large scale hydrogen production. This chapter extends an existing steady state model to a transient model that can describe an alternating injection of air and steam for deep thin coal layers. The model includes transient heat conduction, where the produced heat during the air injection stage is stored in the coal and surrounding strata. The stored heat is subsequently used in the endothermic gasification reactions during the steam injection. Comparison of the results with field data show that product composition and temperature oscillation can be predicted with a reasonable accuracy. The stored heat can deliver additional energy that can maintain the gasification during the steam injection period for a limited time. During the steam injection cycle, at low pressure the volumetric flow and the hydrogen content of the product gas are both high, but at higher pressures while the hydrogen composition is still high, the coal conversion rate decreases considerably. The exergy analysis confirms that alternating injection of air/steam describes a practical process for UCG at low pressure. However, injection of a mixture of steam and oxygen results in a practical recovery factor of 50% and produces 0.15 kg CO2 per MJ of exergy, which is higher than the practical recovery factor (40%) of the alternating injection process, which produces 0.12 kg CO2 / MJ of exergy. In the second part of the thesis, two issues related to aquifer storage of CO2 are discussed: injectivity problems due to salt precipitation, and storage capacity and long term storage due to dissolution of CO2 in water. In chapter 4, the negative saturation (NegSat) method, which is a combination of negative flash and multicomponent single/two-phase flow in porous media, is studied. It has been shown to be beneficial in numerical simulations of phase appearance/disappearance for mixtures that consist of volatile components, i.e., components that appear in both liquid and gas phases. The method is extended to a three phase system of CO2 -water-NaCl, in which NaCl appears as a nonvolatile dissolved component (NaCl) and as an immobile precipitated solid phase. The extended method is of practical use to assess carbon dioxide storage options. A detailed thermodynamic analysis of the NegSat method is given and the possibility to extend it to injection in brine aquifers is demonstrated. Precipitation of salt occurs due to evaporation of water into supercritical CO2 . Precipitation decreases the permeability near the injection well forming a dried-out zone. With the ensuing permeability change, the injection pressure needs to be increased to maintain the CO2 injection rate, which requires more compression energy and hence influences the exergetic viability of the carbon dioxide sequestration process.. To address this issue, first a thermodynamic model is optimized to predict the phase behavior of the CO2 -water-NaCl system with reasonable accuracy. Then the NegSat method for two-phase flow is modified to include salt precipitation. The model is solved to analyze the effect of various physical parameters on the injectivity of CO2 . Finally an exergy analysis is performed to quantify the effect of salt precipitation on the compression power requirement for CO2 injection into high pressure-high temperature-high salinity aquifers. Exergetic applicability of carbon capture and sequestration for low emission carbon dioxide fuel consumption, can presently only be achieved if the energy-intensive step of nitrogen-CO2 separation prior to injection can be avoided. In chapter 5, the enhanced mass transfer of CO2 in water for a CO2 saturated layer on top of a water saturated porous medium is studied experimentally and theoretically. Dissolution of carbon dioxide in water has a large effect on the capacity of an aquifer for carbon dioxide storage. Without the dissolution effect the storage capacity of aquifers is low. A high pressure cylinder with a length of 0.5 m and a diameter of 0.15 m is used in pressure decay experiments. The relatively large size of the vessel minimizes the pressure measurement errors that can happen due to temperature fluctuations and small leakages. The experimental results were compared to the theoretical result in terms of onset time of natural convection and rate of mass transfer of CO2 in the convection dominated process. In addition a non-isothermal multicomponent flow model in porous media is solved numerically to study the effect of the heat of dissolution of CO2 in water on the rate of mass transfer of CO2 . The effect of the capillary transition zone on the rate of mass transfer of CO2 is also studied theoretically. The simulation results including the effect of the capillary transition zone show a better agreement with experimental results compared to the simulation result without considering a capillary transition zone. The simulation results also show that the effect of heat of dissolution on the rate of mass transfer is negligible. The overall conclusion is that, for the current state of technology, use of underground coal gasification with a similar carbon foot print as the use of natural gas is not possible. It is to be expected that technological developments will make it possible in the future to use coal with a low carbon footprint.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "b0cd3cd20d5d68777f263121f169374af1576e7d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2890778597", "CorpusId": 134358234}, "title": "Transient performance of combined cycle power plant with absorption based post-combustion CO2 capture: dynamic simulations and pilot plant testing", "abstract": "The thesis presents transient performance analysis of chemical absorption processes for reducing CO2 emissions from natural gas combined cycle power plants (NGCCs), which can contribute to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere and mitigate climate change.

Contributions comprised development and validation of high fidelity dynamic process models and evaluation of process dynamics of commercial scale NGCC with PCC power plant, including analysis of the performance of decentralized control structures for PCC units. In addition, experimental transient testing was conducted at a large-scale state-ofthe-art pilot plant for the evaluation of control structures applied to the chemical absorption process. Additional contributions included design of validation cases for dynamic process models of chemical absorption processes. The main methods employed were dynamic modeling and simulation and experimental transient testing. The thesis results include five peer-review research articles. High efficiency thermal power plants using novel solutions for operational flexibility improvements and CO2 emission reductions will be needed now and in the future to balance the variable renewable energy within decarbonized power systems. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies can significantly reduce the carbon intensity of thermal power plants. The carbon intensity of state-of-the-art combined cycle power plants is around 365 g CO2/kWh, while for NGCC with PCC it is calculated to be around 50 g CO2/kWh. A 600 MW NGCC with PCC was designed and evaluated. The process configuration selected included one heavy-duty gas turbine and a triple-pressure reheat heat recovery steam generator in the combined cycle power plant, and a chemical absorption post-combustion CO2 capture unit with 30 wt% MEA as chemical solvent. The resulting net LHV electric efficiency of the integrated process was 52.8% and the specific reboiler duty at design point was 3.73 MJ/kgCO2. In order to identify scenarios for flexible operation of thermal power plants with CCS, a study on power markets and technical requirements was conducted. Technical grid requirements and frameworks for power units to provide ancillary services and bidding in balancing markets in four different power areas in EU were identified. In order to assess the transient performance of the NGCC with PCC, it was required to develop high fidelity physical dynamic process models. The selected tool for dynamic process modeling was the open physical modeling language Modelica. The focus of the study was to evaluate flexible operation of the chemical absorption process when integrated with power plant operations, with focus on power plant load variations. A detailed literature review proved necessary to validate dynamic process models of post-combustion chemical absorption of CO2 with large-scale pilot plant data for flue gas with low CO2 content characteristic of GT flue gas. However, the availability of suitable data sets for validation was scarce. Therefore, a set of validation cases for dynamic process model of the post-combustion CO2 capture process with chemical absorption using 30 wt% MEA was designed with data from operations of the large-scale amine plant at Technology Centre Mongstad.

Carbon sources: For this article, we are worried with large stationary sources of CO2, e.g. fossil fueled power plants, cement manufacturing, ammonia production, industrial boilers, refineries, natural gas wells. Carbon capture: The separation and entrapment of CO2 from large stationary sources. CO2 storage: The injection of CO2 into geologic or oceanic reservoirs for timescales of centuries or longer. CO2 capture and storage CO2 is emitted basically from the burning of fossil fuels, both in large combustion units such as those used for electric power generation and in smaller, distributed sources such as automobile engines and furnaces used in residential and commercial buildings. CO2 emissions also result from some industrial resource extraction processes, as well as from the burning of forests during land clearance. CCS would most likely be applied to large point sources of CO2, such as power plants or large industrial processes. Some of these sources could supply decarbonized fuel such as hydrogen to the transportation, industrial and building sectors, and thus reduce emissions from those distributed sources. CCS involves the use of technology, primarily to collect and concentrate the CO2 produced industries and energy related sources, transport it to a suitable storage location, and then store it away from the atmosphere for a long period of time. CCS would thus allow fossil fuels to be used with low emissions of greenhouse gases. Application of CCS to biomass energy sources could result in the net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere (often referred to as \u2018negative emissions\u2019) by capturing and storing the atmospheric CO2 taken up by the biomass, provided the biomass is not harvested at an unsustainable rate. ________________________________________________________________________________________________________ Concise Definition of Subject One of the approaches for mitigating or reducing potential global climate change due to anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is to capture CO2 from fossil fuel using sources, and to store it in geologic or oceanic reservoirs.

But predictions on reservoir time and space scales are difficult to validate because data are generally sparse and will only be useful for a small part of the relevant time period. Laboratory scale data are valuable to validate the numerical models. In this paper we focus on the comparison of experimental and numerical determination of CO2 mass transfer in a laboratory experiment. We developed an experimental protocol for the determination of density-driven mass transfer of CO2 in water-saturated Hele-Shaw cells with different apertures. We used a CCD camera to capture images of the initiation of density-driven convection caused by dissolution of CO2 in water and the subsequent development of convective fingers. The visualization of the phenomenon allowed consistently stopping the experiment when dissolved CO2 first reached the bottom of the cell. We determined the total mass of dissolved CO2 during the experiment using a catalytic combustion-based total carbon analyzer (TCanalyzer). This experimental procedure was repeated several times for uncertainty analysis. Thus a combination of quantitative and qualitative experimental results for the same Hele-Shaw cell configuration was obtained for validation of corresponding numerical simulation results. A numerical simulation of the phenomenon was carried out using the STOMP-WCS simulator. We found that in order to accurately simulate numerically the phenomenon occurring in the Hele-Shaw cell, existent variations in the cell apertures should be taken into account. Thus we observed a good agreement between the experimental and numerical results in terms of total dissolved CO2 mass, timescale of mass transport and morphology of the convection fingers. In addition correlations are obtained between total dissolved CO2 mass, arrival time of dissolved CO2 to bottom of the cell, and the Rayleigh number. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Chemical-looping combustion is a method intended to capture CO2 without an energy consuming gas separation process. Gas separation is avoided by using circulating oxygen carriers to transfer oxygen from an air reactor to a fuel reactor. Thus, the fuel and the combustion air are never mixed. \nA thermal analysis of the process identified several oxygen carrier systems with properties suitable for chemical-looping combustion applications. Such properties include high ability to convert different fuels, stability in air and sufficiently high melting temperature. Systems fulfilling these criteria were; metal oxides based on Ni, Cu, Fe, Mn, Co, W and sulphates of Ba, Sr and Ca. \nIn the experimental part of this work, Ni- and Fe-based particles were analyzed with respect to both chemical and physical properties important for oxygen carriers in chemical-looping combustion, as well as gas conversion in a fluidized bed. \nOxygen carriers of NiO, supported by NiAl2O4, are suitable for converting gaseous fuels with a high content of CH4. The main reasons are their high reactivity and high melting temperature. The Ni-based oxygen carriers investigated here were prepared from commercially available raw materials in contrast to the pure chemicals which have generally been used before. Oxygen carriers prepared by spray-drying, a production method suitable for large-scale particle preparation, displayed similar properties as oxygen carriers produced by the small-scale freeze-granulation method. Thus, up-scaling of particle production is not expected to present any difficulties. To reduce the risk of fragmentation and attrition of Ni-based oxygen carriers in a circulating chemical-looping combustion system, the strength can be improved by an addition of Ca(OH)2, by increasing the sintering temperature or by extending the sintering time. Materials with MgO added during particle preparation or with MgAl2O4 as supporting agent resulted in a considerably increased CH4 conversion. All oxygen carriers showed high reactivity with CH4 and O2 and a for a promising oxygen carrier of NiO/NiAl2O4, it was concluded that in an ideal reactor without gas solid-phase mass transfer limitations, full CH4 yield should be reached with a solids inventory in the fuel reactor of less than 10-20 kg/MW at 950\u00b0C. \nFe-based oxygen carriers are cheap, abundant and environmentally sound and therefore well suited for chemical-looping combustion with solid fuels, where the expected lifetime of the oxygen carriers is comparatively short. Several industrial iron-based materials and a natural iron ore with properties well suited for chemical-looping combustion with solid fuels were identified. Generally, these materials displayed a high conversion of syngas, the main intermediate when solid fuels are gasified by steam, in combination with a high mechanical strength.

Curbing global emissions from fossil fuels has become a major and urgent priority. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has been proposed as a method to capture greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from large point source fossil fuel combustion and store these emissions away from the atmosphere to reduce the impact on the climate. CCS involves capturing the predominant GHG produced in fossil fuel combustion, CO2, at the point source and transporting it to a location where is can be stored for thousands of years to limit its impact on the climate. Geological storage is considered to be the most advanced and realistic option for CO2 storage, and is the focus of this thesis. \nThe aim of this thesis is to assess the risks and opportunities for CO2 storage in the UK offshore region, where the majority of UK CO2 storage capacity is expected to exist in saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. A review of the technical considerations for geological CO2 storage is presented and the potential storage capacities and risks to secure storage in the UK are identified. Fluid flow simulation and coupled fluid flow-geomechanical modelling are used to assess several aspects of storage, based on the assessment of the potential risks for storage in the UK. These include assessment of current capacity estimates for CO2 injection into the largest potential source of UK storage capacity the Bunter Saline Aquifer; opportunities for brine extraction to increase capacity in saline aquifers and the potential for a reduction in capacity and risk of leakage through fracture pressure hysteresis in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs. \nThree key results are identified from the work. Firstly, significantly lower capacities are modelled for the Bunter Aquifer, compared to both static estimates and more complex models in the literature. This is due to the potential variability in parameters, such as the compressibility and fracture pressure, which control capacity. Estimates for the capacity in the Bunter from the modelling range between 3.1 and 8.7 Gt CO2 which corresponds to between 20 and 56 years of storage capacity for the UK, this is compared to an initial estimate of 90 years of storage capacity from static estimates. Fracture pressure estimation is uncertain and fracture pressure is a significant control on capacity in the generic modelling it is shown to reduce capacity by 32 \u2013 60% with a 20% reduction in fracture pressure. The most conservative fracture pressure assumption for the modelled capacities in the Bunter Aquifer would indicate a reduced capacity as low as 2.5 Gt CO2 . Potential variability in the fracture pressure is the second major finding of this work and is intrinsically related to variability in capacity. Coupled fluid flow geomechanical modelling indicates that the fracture pressure in depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs with similar stress conditions and material parameters to those found in the UK North Sea could be up to 19% lower during injection compared to the depletion fracture pressures. This is without including the effect of thermally induced tensile stresses developed due to the injection of cold CO2 which may reduce fracture pressures further. Finally, capacity modelling in the Bunter Aquifer has also identified a potential legacy risk for CO2 storage in a large aquifer such as the Bunter. The peak fracture pressure risk is not observed in the model until 6 \u2013 136 years after injection has stopped, and occurs great distances from the injection point. This poses questions as to the methodology for monitoring this risk, the potential remediation options and the impact on other activities within the aquifer. \nThe research highlights several areas where further investigation are essential for constraining CO2 storage capacity and leakage risks, with the primary uncertainty relating to the quantification of fracture pressure in both saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "628ebccca9cb1901607ea19330773368f1988df5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1487143739", "DOI": "10.3233/IJR-120109", "CorpusId": 106520742}, "title": "Real Options as a Decision-making Tool in Climate Finance Evaluated with a Case Study on CCS", "abstract": "Climate action is a challenging task and uncertainties in climate science make decision making extremely difficult.

While no single measure may alone be sufficient for climate change mitigation, Carbon Capture and Sequestration/Storage (CCS), along with energy efficiency improvements, renewable energy, enhancement of biological sinks, and other measures, may be able to achieve the emissions reductions needed to achieve climate stabilization. In addition, there will be important decisions in climate adaptation areas too, further adding to the complexities of decision making for climate action. In this paper, a normative case study is incorporated to determine the cost of CCS action in India. While arriving at the costs, a provision for the financial risk of storage has also been added. Given the costs, Real Options analysis is undertaken to arrive at a decision. The Real Options valuation is done using the Black-Scholes method.

However, lack of confidence in geologic CO2 storage security remains a barrier to CCS implementation. Leak rates of 0.01% yr -1 , equivalent to 99% retention of the stored CO2 after 100 years, are referred to by many stakeholders as adequate to ensure the effectiveness of CO2 storage 1\u20133 . Secure storage must allow global average temperatures, driven by excess CO2, to decrease well below 2\u00b0C; these timescales are typically modelled to be 10,000 years 4 . Thus, leakage rates must remain below an average linear rate of 0.01% yr -1 for that timespan. Many studies that assess global industry-wide risk of subsurface gas leakage do not specifically consider subsurface CO2 retention mechanisms 5,6 , despite experimental measurements showing that residual trapping may immobilise a significant proportion of the CO2 almost immediately on injection 7 . The published studies that incorporate subsurface CO2 retention into their risk assessments are for site-specific, real or hypothetical, hydrogeological models 8,9 , rather than industry-wide, regional, or global scenarios. Here, we present a numerical program that calculates CO2 storage security and leakage to the atmosphere over 10kyr. This links processes of geologically measured CO2 subsurface retention (residual and dissolution trapping), and CO2 leakage estimates (based on measured surface fluxes from appropriate analogues). We model 12 GtCO2 of cumulative storage based on the EU\u2019s 2050 target 10 , commencing injection in 2020, and calculate CO2 retention for well-regulated onshore and offshore scenarios, and for a hypothetical onshore, poorly regulated scenario. Simulations using base-case, expert chosen values for model input parameters give total leakage after 10,000 years of between 2 and 23% of the stored CO2, equating to simplified time-averaged linear leak rates of between 0.0002% yr -1 and 0.002% yr -1 , respectively. Uncertainty on the results, introduced through uncertainties in the input parameters, is quantified using Monte Carlo analysis. These Monte Carlo results show that CO2 storage in regions with moderate abandoned well densities and that are regulated using current best practice will retain 96% of the injected CO2 over 10,000 years in more than half of the cases, and will lose 9.6% of the injected CO2 in fewer than 5% of cases. An unrealistic unregulated case, with unknown and inadequately abandoned wells shows a 50% probability that leakage is below 0.003% yr -1 over 10kyr, meaning more than 70% of the CO2 is securely retained over 10kyr.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "e598f3e40eae8408f07c4376e649f9824a014977", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2369173845", "CorpusId": 156700410}, "title": "Analysis on Energy-Saving & Emission-Reduction Effects of Technological Progresses in Coal-Fired Power Industry of China", "abstract": "The coal-fired power industry in China is facing some grave challenges such as tougher environmental protection requirements and increasing pressures of emission reduction.This paper firstly establishes a hybrid CGE model by linking the engineering sub-model of coal-fired power generation with an energy CGE model to simulate the complex system of energy,economy and environment in China.Based on the calculation within the established model,it presents predictions on China's electricity demand by 2030 under the strict policy of energy saving and emission reduction,and forecasts the energy saving,pollutant gas emission and greenhouse gas emission of China after the advanced coal-fired power technologies are adopted.The results indicate that the SO2 emission issue in China will completely meet the requirements of pretect environment by 2030 and that the coal-fired power industry should focus on researching and developing the high-efficient desulfurization technology in recent years.From the view of sustainable development,the CCS technology(carbon capture storage) should be gradually introduced to the domestic coal-fired power sector both in the mid and long term.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "bf81c43451c7dd3a146c46e490266586ca6f8b4c", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.13187/bgt.2018.2.159", "CorpusId": 239563492}, "title": "Nature-Similar Technologies of the Biogeosystem Technique in Solving a Global Social and Environmental Problem", "abstract": "Soil fertility is associated with the soil health, which determines the environment-forming (ecological) functions of the terrestrial-soil ecosystem \u2013 biological quality of products, and minimized ecoand sociosphere eco-toxic load.

To reduce GHG concentration in atmosphere, carbon capture and storage (CCS) has emerged as a promising bridge technology, by capturing CO2 from the major sources such as cement factories, fossil fuel-based production plants, etc. and subsequently storing it in subsurface. CCS technology greatly reduces CO2 concentration and restricts and protects subsequent migration by safely storing within geologic formations for millions of years. The CO2 is injected into suitable geological formations at depths below 800 m or more, and various trapping mechanisms would prevent further migration of the stored CO2 to the surface.

While it will be problematic to employ a prescriptive approach for all storage sites, regulators are aiming to identify a common practice and inform a set of recommendations and guidelines necessary for large scale commercial projects. Reservoir characterisation is not a new science, drawing on tried and tested practices such as sequence stratigraphy, advanced geophysical mapping, formation evaluation, engineering and Modelling, long used in the oil and gas industry. Understanding subsurface fluid behaviour at a CO2 storage site will use the same methods but place a particular emphasis on characterizing injectivity, effects of vertical permeability, large scale hydrodynamics, geochemical interactions and long term containment. In the case of saline aquifer storage, it may be challenging as these characteristics must be addressed over large areas often with very little data available. A few significant research papers have laid the foundations for site selection methodology. [2-4]. Similarly, a few case studies have fully documented their workflows in the public domain as \u201cbest Practice\u201d site characterisation for CO2 storage sites [5]. All advocate a mulitidiciplinary approach bringing together available data in order to identify potential risks. This in turn identifies where more data needs to be gathered in order to reduce uncertainties. When this is not practical, characterisation will depend heavily on analogues and multi-case scenario modelling to perform sensitivity analysis and provide ranges rather than a definitive answer to questions surrounding injection rates, migration times, total capacity, and trapping. As may be observed from the few Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects either underway, or proposed, site characterisation, in a risk management framework, is undeniably site and project specific. The level of characterisation needs to be risk appropriate, as well as source and sink appropriate. What defines an adequate or \u201cfit for purpose\u201d site assessment will become evident as more and more practical examples can be examined.

CO2 could be utilized to enhance production of shale gas. By doing so, subsurface storage of CO2 becomes economical. For instance, in the case of Utica formation, economically producible gas-in-place of 104 Trillion cubic feet (Tcf) becomes an incentive to store up to 10 Gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 (Godec et al. 2014). The storage mechanism of nanoporous shales is highly dependent of its surface properties; 80% of the storage capacity or gas-in-place is estimated to be due to sorption of fluid on the pores\u2019 surface area (Ambrose et al. 2012). In-situ sorption capacity can be calculated from sorption measurements at elevated pressure. However, conversion of the laboratory data to storage capacity requires a prior knowledge of the nanopore structure, which is characterized by the pore volume, pore-size distribution (PSD), and specific surface area (SSA). Nanostructure of shales can be inverted from low pressure adsorption measurements. N2 adsorption at 77 K is most commonly measured for this purpose due to the availability of the gas and well-established analysis methods. The first part of this thesis compares the continuum and statistical thermodynamicsbased analysis methods applied on shales. Although IUPAC recommends the application of statistical thermodynamics-based analysis (Thommes et al. 2015), it must be noted that resulting parameters are highly model dependent. Although none of the methods is perfectly applicable to shales, we observe systematic differences between the resulting PSD and SSA from the methods investigated. The second part of this thesis confirms the need of complementing N2 results with CO2 adsorption at 273 K, particularly for the evaluation of sorption capacity of organic-rich shales. Comparison between N2 and CO2 adsorption shows that CO2 can access much smaller pores than N2. And CO2-derived SSA and pore volume is much larger than N2-derived SSA and pore volume.

Studying the potential of industrial emission reduction has great significance in estimating the carbon emission peak of China on the one hand, and adjusting its strategy in international climate change negotiations. By employing the economic accounting method, this article estimates the emission reduction potential of China\u2019s Industrial sector for the period of 2010\u20132050. It reveals that, taking 2030 as the year when the emission reaches the peak, the total reduction can be 8.38 billion tons (bts) for the period of 2010\u20132030, with 3.12 bts from structural reduction while 5.26 bts from intensity reduction. Afterwards, reduction will continue with a total amount of 6.59 bts for the period of 2030\u20132050, where the structural reduction accounts for 2.47 bts, and intensity reduction 4.115 bts. If both industrial and energy consumption structures are improved during the above period, the reduction potential can be even greater, e.g. the emission peak can arrive five years earlier (in the year of 2025) and the peak value can decline by about 8% as compared to the original estimation. Reviewing the trajectory of emission changes in developed countries indicates that the industry sector can contribute to the overall reduction targets through the dual wheels of structural reduction and intensity reduction, even beyond the emission peak. This article concludes with the following policy suggestions. (1) Our estimation on the emission peak of the industrial sector suggests that China should avoid any commitment earlier than 2030 on the timeline of the overall emission peak; (2) the great potential of industrial emission reduction can improve the situation of China in climate change negotiation, where the intensity reduction can serve as an important policy option. (3) Reduction potential can be further enhanced through technology advancement, which requires furthering of market oriented reforms and improvement of institutional design. (4) To secure the reduction effects of the industrial structure adjustment, the balanced development among different regions should be encouraged in order to avoid the reverse adjustment caused by industrial transferring.

Trees need water to grow and, at the same time, they change the quality and the quantity of runoff by modifying water and nutrient cycling. The understanding of the interactions between forest and water is fundamental to assess the consequences of natural and anthropogenic pressures, such as climate change and forest management, on the provision of forest products and services.Due to the complexity of ecosystems, models are often used to understand the interactions between different system components under a changing environment. ForSAFE is a dynamic, mechanistic ecosystem model simulating the storage and fluxes of chemical elements in forest ecosystems. It was developed to better understand the effects of environmental changes on the chemistry of forest biomass, soil and soil water at the forest plot level.The first two studies in this thesis are examples of the application of ForSAFE in forest stands in Southern Sweden. The model is used to simulate the effects of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on different ecosystem indicators, including indicators of soil water quality. The studies show that nutrient leaching below the rooting zone is positively related to the nutrient availability at the site, soil disturbances and the amount of organic material left in the forest after tree felling or a storm. Both types of disturbance produce a temporary increase of the acidity of the soil solution, but long-term effects where not predicted by the model. Compared to harvesting, a higher nutrient release in the soil solution can occur after storms due to root lifting causing increased mineralisation, a larger amount of biomass left at the site due to technical and economic constraints and larger canopy openings. In addition, sea-salt episodes can increase the acidity of the soil solution in the first years after the storm. When considering other ecosystem services, trade-offs can exist between the reduction of nutrient loads in the soil solution and the accumulation of carbon in the forest.The conclusions drawn from the application of ForSAFE at the forest plot level are valid for the soil water chemistry in the unsaturated zone. In this thesis, an effort has been made to expand the model simulations from the plot to the hillslope scale to understand how forest ecosystems can affect the chemistry of the streams. A new hydrology concept was integrated in ForSAFE-2D that simulates two-dimensional flows of water and chemical elements from the forest to the stream.ForSAFE-2D allows a better representation of the moisture content by simulating an increasing water saturation level in deeper soil layers and towards the stream. The simulated transport of a tracer along a hillslope shows that the model is capable of capturing the average concentrations of the tracer in the stream. This capability is based on a correct representation of the long-term average runoff and of tracer concentrations in the soil solution.The results also highlight some of the issues that should be addressed by follow-up research studies. The partitioning of water between base flow and peak flows suggests that the simulation of flow paths by ForSAFE-2D should be re-evaluated. A correct representation of flow paths will be crucial when simulating the transport of elements or compounds which change concentration with depth or distance from the stream (e.g. dissolved organic matter). In addition, the effects of saturation on weathering, as well as decomposition, show that the regulation of these processes at increasing moisture contents should be updated. Finally, the process regulating the allocation of carbon and nutrients to foliage should be revised to increase the share of foliage in the tree biomass and thereby correct the simulation of evapotranspiration.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "93427fb3eb0c1c375844e688e150ad7f17994faf", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/corr/abs-2009-11693", "ArXiv": "2009.11693", "MAG": "3089227370", "CorpusId": 221878967}, "title": "A Variational Auto-Encoder for Reservoir Monitoring", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) is an important strategy in mitigating anthropogenic CO$_2$ emissions.

Marine geological storage of CO2 involves the capture of CO2 from major point sources (such as a power plant) and the transport of CO2 to storage sites in marine geological structures such as a deep sea saline aquifer. Since 2005, we have developed relevant technologies for marine geological storage of CO2 . Those technologies include possible storage site surveys and basic designs for CO2 transport and storage processes. To design a reliable CO2 marine geological storage system, we devised a hypothetical scenario and used a numerical simulation tool to study its detailed processes. The process of transport CO2 from the capture sites to the storage sites can be simulated with a thermodynamic equation of state. We compared and analyzed the relevant equation of state, including the Benedict-Webb-Rubin-Starling (BWRS), Peng-Robinson (PR), Peng-Robinson-Boston-Mathias (PRBM) and Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK) equations of state. To evaluate the predictive accuracy of the equation of state, we compare the results of numerical calculations with experimental reference data. In a supercritical state (above 31.1\u00b0C and 73.9bar), which corresponds to the thermodynamic conditions of CO2 reservoir sites, the BWRS, PR, and PRBM equations of state showed a good predictive capability. On the other hand, the SRK equation of state showed a high error rate of 300% in the supercritical state. This paper analyzes the major design parameters that are useful for constructing onshore and offshore CO2 transport systems. On the basis of a parametric study of the hypothetical scenario, we suggest relevant variation ranges for the design parameters, particularly the flow rate, diameter, temperature, and pressure. Using the hypothetical scenario, we also studied how the thermodynamic conditions of CO2 affect on the fluid flow behavior and thermal characteristics of a pipeline transport system.

The model considers a simplified representation of the main transmission network and representative days to simulate operations considering the variability of demand and renewable resources at different geographical locations. We perform a scenario analysis assuming different ambitious renewable energy and emission reduction targets by 2050. As observed in other studies, we show that the incremental cost of reducing CO2 emissions without carbon capture or offset alternatives increases significantly as the system approaches zero emissions. Indeed, the carbon tax is multiplied by a factor of 4 to eliminate the last Mt of CO2 emissions, i.e., from 2000 to almost 8500 USD/tCO2 in 2050. This result highlights the importance of implementing technology-neutral mechanisms that help investors identify the most cost-efficient actions to reduce CO2 emissions. Our analysis shows that Carbon Capture and Storage could permit to divide by more than two the total system cost of a 100% renewable scenario.

Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is one of the key mitigation actions that have been proposed to meet this goal. Capture of CO2 can be effectively applied to large point sources, like natural gas production facilities, in order to separate CO2 from other gaseous products as a concentrated stream which can be readily transported to a storage site. Cryogenic CO2 removal methods have been widely studied recently as a technology which offers some advantages in comparison with conventional solutions in case of those natural gas reserves that were previously considered uneconomic due to the presence of significant amounts of acidic gas components (carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide). Furthermore, cryogenic CO2 removal methods can capture CO2 in a liquid form, making its geological storage relatively easy. Some cryogenic removal technologies are based on the formation of solid CO2 while in other processes particular attention is required to avoid the formation of dry ice. As a result, in both cases, it is necessary to be able to predict the conditions at which CO2 can freeze-out. A thermodynamic method has been proposed for modeling the solubility of carbon dioxide in pure light hydrocarbons and hydrogen sulfide and in multicomponent mixtures. It is based on the use of a cubic equation of state (EoS) for the calculation of fugacity coefficients in the liquid and vapor phases. The Soave-Redlich-Kwong and the Peng-Robinson EoSs have been chosen in this work since they are widely used in natural gas processing systems.

Applying Carbon Capture (CC), offers a solution, yet this option was never found economically feasible for these small-scales (5-500kWe). Indeed, the postcombustion chemical absorption process requires a considerable amount of energy, degrading the plant performances. The heat required to regenerate the solvent in the stripper column is the main contribution to the CC energy consumption. Therefore, to make carbon-clean mGTs more efficient and thus economically profitable, this energy penalty must be minimized. Next to a better integration of the different mGT and CC heat streams, selection of the appropriate solvent and process configuration will help reducing this energy penalty. In this respect, this work is a pre-study on the impact of the solvent and process selection on the energy consumption for the CC plant coupled with an mGT. Two amine(s)-based solvents are selected and investigated in this preliminary study: monoethanolamine (MEA) and a mixture of methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) with piperazine (PZ) implemented considering an InterCooling Absorber (ICA) configuration. To compare the potential of both solvents, the performance of an mGT, namely the Turbec T100, coupled with a chemical absorption plant is assessed for both cases using Aspen Plus. Firstly, the operating parameters, such as the solvent mass flow rate and the stripper pressure, have been optimized for the conventional MEA process, resulting in a decrease in the Specific Reboiler Duty from 4.53 MJ/kgCO2 to 3.86 MJ/kgCO2. Next, the use of MDEA/PZ instead of MEA, after selecting the most suitable solvent composition and operating parameters, resulted in a specific reboiler duty of 3.22 MJ/kgCO2, corresponding to a 29.1% decrease compared to the conventional MEA process. Finally, the ICA configuration does not show any real improvement in CC performances.", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "3003ce02bc1ac39a8d2c74434c3cbccef1e7728a", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 12742396}, "title": "CO 2 Abatement Strategies for Polygeneration Systems : Process Integration and Analysis", "abstract": "Several decarbonised polygeneration systems exploiting carbon capture and storage (CCS) or CO2 reuse technologies for the conversion of primary resources into clean fuels, chemicals, electricity and heat are systematically analysed for techno-economic feasibility.

These indicators include the effect of process configurations and operating conditions on the economic potential (EP), energy efficiency, decarbonisation potential, economic risks, value of products and sensitivity in EP due to carbon taxations.

In this study, the simultaneous production of hydrogen and separable solid carbon from methane was experimentally achieved in a bubble column filled with molten potassium chloride. The melt acted as a carbon-separating agent and as a pyrolytic catalyst, and enabled 40 h of continuous running without catalytic deactivation with an apparent activation energy of 277 kJ/mole.

These release events of CO2 can lead to a serious environmental hazard. Therefore, it is necessary to detect accidental CO2 leakage more accurately and to decrease the risk of CCS. Artificial carbon dioxide injection into a shallow aquifer system was carried out with two injection type imitating short- and long-term CO2 leakage events into a shallow aquifer. One is pulse type leakage of CO2 (6 hours) under a natural hydraulic gradient (0.02) which imitate the point leaking situation developed along the vertical preferential pathway such as fracture or a crack in an injection pipe and the other is long-term continuous injection (30 days) under a forced hydraulic gradient (0.2) which indicated situation that CO2 leakage can be happened at a wide-ranging areas. Injection and monitoring tests were performed at the K-COSEM site in Eumseong, Korea where a specially designed well field had been installed for artificial CO2 release tests. Total 45 monitoring wells which include 4 multi-depth monitoring well nests for depth-discrete gas monitoring at unsaturated zone and also 4 multi-depth monitoring well nests for groundwater monitoring at saturated zone were installed at the site aligned with the regional groundwater flow direction. CO2-infused and tracer gases dissolved groundwater was injected through a well below groundwater table and monitoring were conducted in both saturated and unsaturated zones. Real-time monitoring data on CO2 concentration in saturated zone and unsaturated zone using NDIR sensor and OL-AP (open loop-air purging system), temperature using TLS (thermal logging system) and hydraulic parameters (pH and EC) were collected. Also, periodical measurements of several gas tracers (He, Ar, Kr, SF6), TIC (total inorganic carbon), carbon isotope (\u03b413C) were obtained. The pulse type short-term injection test was carried out prior to the longterm injection test. Results of the short-term injection test, under natural hydraulic gradient, showed that CO2 plume migrated along the preferential pathway identified through hydraulic interference tests. On the other hand, results of the long-term injection test indicated the CO2 plume migration path was aligned to the forced hydraulic gradient. Compared to the short-term test, the long-term injection formed detectable CO2 concentration change in unsaturated wellbores. Results of process-based analysis based on concentration data of O2 and CO2 indicated that CO2 concentration in unsaturated zone before injection affected by both biological respiration and CO2 dissolution. However, the origin of CO2 is changed to by exogenous addition ever since CO2 injection carried out. As time passed after shut down the injection event, the CO2 concentration reverts to its original position. Recovery data of tracer gases made breakthrough curves. From the interpretation results of recovery data, the physical processes such as phase-partitioning and degassing process governing mass balance problem of leaking CO2 in shallow groundwater system was identified. The monitoring results indicated that detection of CO2 leakage into groundwater was more effectively performed by using a pumping and monitoring method in order to capture by-passing plume.

Given these uncertainties, extensive monitoring of CO2 injection projects is required. We developed a unique laboratory facility for the observation of subsurface CO2 leakage evolution. A thin transparent tank is filled with different sizes of glass-beads to form controlled layered stratigraphies; then the medium is saturated with water mixed with a universal pH indicator. The flow-controlled injection of CO2 is carefully controlled using pressure transducers with precise needle valve and, time-lapse photography permits capturing the evolution of gas invasion and diffusion. Results show the nature of CO2 gas migration in the near surface, the effect of fine-grained layers such as the cap-rock, water acidification near conduits and subsequent diffusion, the convection of carbonated water. In addition to this trial to understand salient characteristics on subsurface CO2 leakage, applicability of borehole based resistivity tomography is assessed. The measurement system for resistivity tomography is attached to the CO2 gas migration monitoring system. An adequate inversion scheme is proposed based on 3-D forward modeling. The array types are dipole-dipole and modified pole-dipole, which were specially designed for this lab-scale test. A mixture of in-line and cross surveys is employed. Produced resistivity images are compared with time-lapse digital images taken during CO2 gas leakage simulation. The visible feasibility check for the borehole resistivity tomography in detecting subsurface CO2 leakage is expected. CO2 leakage where we observe the phenomena related to CO2 injection at an imaginary vertical section of underground sample. Photos were taken at regular intervals and we attempted to capture the evolution of gas invasion and diffusion. Although our study was with normal pressure and temperature conditions and small scale physical modeling, coupled hydro-chemo-mechanical (HCM) processes, which are difficult to simulate through numerical modeling, could be observed. This study provides a foundation for understanding the real phenomena related to CO2 geological sequestration. For monitoring CO2 storage sites, use of geophysical tomography methods has been studied (Arts et al., 2000). Use of the geophysical methods performed on the ground surface is limited because the effective storage depth is about 1000 m. When CO2 is dissolved in the water, the concentration of carbonated water is increased. This lowers the resistivity of the medium. On the other hand, CO2 gas migration displaces water in pores and this increases the resistivity of the medium. CO2 gas migration due to storage or leakage changes the resistivity of the medium, and it can be monitored through resistivity tomography (Nakatsuka et al., 2010). If a resistivity survey can catch the complex phenomena caused by subsurface CO2 leakage, it should be considered as a concrete option for monitoring CO2 storage sites. We attached a resistivity measurement system based on borehole resistivity tomography to the CO2 gas migration monitoring system. We attempted to get resistivity images when the phenomena related to CO2 leakage were taking place in the tank. These images were compared with the photos. We analyze and discuss the applicability of the resistivity survey.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "b7a10b206d71a4e05d5a2943f238fda1c7b3e65d", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1021/acsami.1c07198", "CorpusId": 235746294, "PubMed": "34227798"}, "title": "Li2S In Situ Grown on Three-Dimensional Porous Carbon Architecture with Electron/Ion Channels and Dual Active Sites as Cathodes of Li-S Batteries.", "abstract": "Li2S-based Li-S batteries are taken as promising energy storage systems due to the high theoretical specific capacity/energy density and nature of a matching Li-metal-free anode. However, the cyclic stability of the Li2S-based Li-S battery is seriously prevented by the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Meanwhile, due to the poor electrical conductivity of Li2S, the Li-S battery displays slow reaction kinetics. In this work, we design 3D-porous carbon (PC) architecture as a host for inhabiting the LiPS shuttle based on physical capture. Furthermore, this porous carbon architecture is modified by introducing two kinds of heteroatoms (N and S) to form dual active sites (named as NSPC) for chemically binding LiPSs and accelerating their conversion. The polyvinyl pyrrolidone-coated Li2SO4\u00b7H2O is embedded in the NSPC skeleton and further forms the Li2S/NSPC cathode via a carbothermal reduction process. In consequence, the NSPC architecture possesses continuous electron/ion channels and abundant active sites, which are beneficial to the fast diffusion of Li+ and timely conversion of sulfur species. As a result, the as-prepared Li2S/NSPC cathode exhibits a high initial discharge capacity of 690 mAh g-1 at a high rate of 1C and keeps a capacity of 587 mAh g-1 after 200 cycles with a good capacity retention rate of 85% and low fading rate of 0.075% per cycle.
