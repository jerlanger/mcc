The process shows promising results facing to solve two of the main challenges within the future energy scenario: CO2 capture from fossil fuel combustion processes and energy storage in renewable-based plants. This thesis is focused in the assessment of the Calcium-Looping allowing a better understanding of the process integration for both applications. Post-combustion CO2 capture based on Calcium-Looping process consist of reacting the CO2 present in the flue gas exiting the fuel power plant with CaO particles according the carbonation reaction, which produces solid CaCO3 as product. CO2 capture efficiencies over 90% have been proved at MWth pilot-scale. After carbonation, solids are sent to a separated reactor where CaO is regenerated according the endothermic calcination reaction. The heat to carry out the reaction is provided by fuel oxy-fuel combustion to ensure a pure CO2 stream exiting the reactor, which after a purification process is ready to be stored or used in another process. The regenerated CaO is sent again to the carbonator reactor for a new CO2 capture cycle. On the other hand, by integrating the Calcium-Looping as thermochemical energy storage system in solar thermal power plants, the process starts performing the calcination reaction from concentrated solar power. CO2 and CaO streams produced are stored separately for later use. When energy is demanded, both components are brought together to the carbonator where the stored energy is released by the carbonation reaction. The carbonation is highly exothermic and therefore a proper integration of the heat released (i.e. for power production) is fundamental for the process efficiency. In spite that both applications are based on the same process, the specific operation conditions required leads to a different behaviour which suggest that the process must be analysed in detail according to each application. This thesis is focused on the development of models and process integration schemes based on lab-scale results under specific conditions selected from the analysis of the potential industrial scale implementation. It involves a multidisciplinary approach combining chemical reactions and process engineering to advance in the response of the challenges posed. This document is structured as follow: the first section introduces the reader to the Calcium- Looping applications, stressing the research opportunities that have motivated the present thesis. This leads to the formulation of the objectives of the work, which are addressed in the presentation and the discussion of the main results of the work. After the conclusions, new research lines to be faced in the near future are summarized. EnglishEl proceso de Calcium-Looping se basa en la reaccion multiciclica de calcinacion-carbonatacion del carbonato de calcio, el cual es uno de los materiales mas abundantes de la tierra. El proceso muestra resultados prometedores para su aplicacion como sistema de captura de CO2 poscombustion, asi como usado en sistemas de almacenamiento termoquimico de energia en plantas renovables. La presente tesis esta enfocada en el analisis del proceso de Calcium-Looping avanzando en la integracion del proceso para ambas aplicaciones. La captura de CO2 poscombustion basada en Calcium-Looping consiste en hacer reaccionar el CO2 presente en los gases de combustion de una planta de potencia con particulas de CaO de acuerdo a la reaccion de carbonatacion, la cual produce CaCO3 como producto. Eficiencias de captura superiores al 90% han sido demostradas a escala piloto. Despues de la carbonatacion, los solidos son enviados a otro reactor donde el CaO es regenerado mediante la reaccion de endotermica de calcinacion. El calor necesario para llevar a cabo la reaccion es obtenido mediante oxicombustion para asegurar una corriente de CO2 pura al a salida del reactor, la cual despues de un proceso de purificacion esta lista para ser almacenada o usada en oro proceso. El CaO regenerado se envia de nuevo al reactor de carbonatacion para un nuevo ciclo de captura. Por otro lado, integrando el proceso de Calcium-Looping como sistema de almacenamiento termoquimico de energia en planas termosolares, el proceso comienza llevando a cabo la reaccion de calcinacion a partir de energia solar concentrada. Como consecuencia de la reaccion, CO2 and CaO son producidos y almacenados por separados para su posterior uso. Cuando es necesaria la produccion de energia, ambos productos de la calcinacion son llevados a un nuevo reactor donde la energia solar almacenada es liberada mediante la reaccion de carbonatacion. Esta reaccion es altamente exotermica por lo que una adecuada integracion del calor liberado es fundamental para la eficiencia del proceso. A pesar de que ambas aplicaciones estan basadas en el mismo proceso, las condiciones especificas requeridas llevan a un comportamiento diferente, lo que sugiere que el proceso debe ser analizado en detalle de acuerdo a cada aplicacion. Esta tesis se centra en el desarrollo de modelos y esquemas de integracion de procesos basados en resultados a escala laboratorio obtenidos a partir de condiciones que simularian la implementacion del proceso a escala industrial. Esto conlleva un enfoque multidisciplinar que combina reacciones quimicas e ingenieria de procesos para avanzar en la respuesta a los retos planteados.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "212f8587b3bf232407b50cd6c20fa019d1300bc9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2968446717", "CorpusId": 202196514}, "title": "Consequence Study of C02 Release from Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) UsingFLUENT-CFD Modeling", "abstract": "Consequence study of accidental C02 released from Carbon Capture and Storage \n(CCS) pipelines is carried out due to the possibility of pipelines failure and the hazard \nimposed from the accidents to human and environment.

A mitigation option to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from existing power plants with fossil fuel combustion is the sequestration of carbon dioxide and storage in geological formations, in the ocean or for use in industrial processes. CO2 capture from combustion exhaust gases by mineral carbonation using a fluidised bed is studied in this project. CFD modelling has been used to study the efficiency of CO2 capture in a fluidized bed reactor containing a solid sorbent Calcium Oxide (CaO). This present work seeks to maximize CO2 conversion by a systematic modification of the flow domain. In particular, it is intended to use a convergent-divergent geometry to control the velocity of particles in the reaction domain thereby keeping the particles in the domain as long as possible. This is expected to improve the performance of the system as more time is allowed for any remaining CO2 to react with CaO and then be removed in the calcination stage. Further the effect of other key parameters such as particle size, CO2 concentration of flue gas and mass loading of solid sorbent have also been investigated. \n \nA Lagrangian/Eulerian scheme has been developed for this purpose, which uses a particle tracking model to describe CaO particle trajectories and mass, momentum and energy exchange with the carrier gas, entering the reactor in a typical flue gas composition. A steady-state condition is assumed, with each trajectory representing a parcel of particles of a given mass and diameter. The number of particles entering the fluidised bed is kept constant, and the fluidization velocity is chosen so that particles remain in the reactor. As the carbonation progresses, heavier well-reacted particles are collected at the bottom of the reactor. In the case of a non-uniform size distribution, fine particles would escape from the top of the reactor; in order to keep such particles within the domain the geometry was modified to increase the residence time of particles and to obtain maximum conversion. CO2 reduction of the order of 90% was achieved in a single pass, with a mass loading of 2.5 times of equivalent solid sorbent to CO2 in gas.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "6efdeda8a331350354a0c04909e58d42c3392056", "externalIds": {"MAG": "905871713", "CorpusId": 127089012}, "title": "Evaluating Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Technology Options with an Energy-Economy Model", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (C02) capture and storage technologies, which allow for the capture of COz from fossil-fuel-burning power plants and long-term storage in saline aquifers, provide an alternative of a de-carbonated economy rather than the complete replacement of our fossil fuel based economy with renewable technologies.

Despite the growth of alternatives, these fuels will continue to play a major role in the energy sector for many decades. In accordance with international agreements, action to curtail C02 emissions is necessary, including carbon capture, reuse and storage. For this purpose, some of the leading technologies are oxy-combustion for power generation and partial oxidation for syngas production. Both require significant quantities of oxygen, whose production can impose considerable energy and economic penalties. Alternative technologies, such as intermediate-temperature ceramic membranes, operating under reactive conditions, promise to ameliorate both. Challenges include the long term stability of the material, reactor design and integration into the overall system. The goal of this thesis is to develop a framework for the thermochemical and electrochemical modeling of oxygen-conducting membranes that can be used in reactor design, based on experimental measurements and detailed surface exchange kinetics and charged species transport. La0. 9Cao. 1Fe03 _ (LCF) perovskite membranes have been used because of their long term stability in a reducing environment. Using experimental measurements, we examine the impact of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methane on oxygen permeation and defect chemistry. While LCF exhibits low flux under non-reactive conditions, in the presence of fuel oxygen permeation increases by more than one order of magnitude. Our experiments confirm that hydrogen surface 3 oxidation is faster compared to carbon monoxide. With methane, syngas production is slow and oxygen permeation is limited by surface exchange on the permeate side. Adding C02 to the fuel stream doubles the oxygen flux and increases syngas production by an order of magnitude. Our modeling analysis shows that different oxidation states of Fe participate in the electron transfer process. To account for this dependency, oxygen transport is modeled using a multi-step (fuel dependent) surface reaction mechanism that preserves thermodynamic consistency and conserves site balance and electroneutrality. Charged species diffusion is modeled using the dilute-limit Poisson-Nernst-Planck formulation that accounts for transport due to concentration gradient as well as electromigration. We use the experimental data to extract kinetic parameters of the model. We couple the aforementioned model with CFD of the gas-phase transport and thermochemistry in an effort to develop a numerical tool that allows the design of membrane reactors that exhibit high oxygen permeation and fuel conversion.

One very promising approach in reducing CO2 emissions is CO2 capture at a power plant, transport to an injection site, and sequestration for long-term storage in any ofa variety of suitable geologic formations. Most common amine solutions used in absorbing CO2 are the alkanolamines such as MEA, DEA and MDEA. Meanwhile, application of sterically hindered amines (SHA) such as AHPD, AEPD, and AMP in gas treating technology are also being studied, as to compare with alkanolamines, in terms ofthe feasibility ofbeing applied for future application in CO2 absorption approach. After all, all amine solutions whether it is lean or saturated with CO2 are corrosive. Due to the effect, all plants that operate CO2absorption have to counter the case ofcorrosion effectively with the improved method, day by day. With this in mind, it is here to present as a research to minimize corrosion by taking into account of the emerging sterically hindered amines(SHA), as the chosen SHA is 2amino-2-ethyl-l,3-propanediol (AEPD), due to the high uptake on CO2 absorption , and stable form of carbamate formed during the reaction with CO2.

In 2009, as a collaboration with the CO2SINK research project on CO2 sequestration taking place in Ketzin, Germany, TNO installed a permanent seismic array that has now already been recording passive data for 2 years during the CO2-injection. The correlation of the large real datasets requires a prior assessment on the feasibility of SI with ambient noise for time-lapse monitoring of the C02 storage process. Using a 1D layered acoustic velocity model of the Ketzin storage site as well as the layout of the TNO\u2019s permanent array, we perform passive experiments that involve finite-difference modelling of passive wavefields from random noise sources and the cross-correlation of these passive synthetic data to retrieve reflection responses. By repeating the experiment for base and monitor velocity scenarios from CO2 saturation changes in the reservoir, we study the influence of various noise parameters (the number of sources, the sources\u2019 duration, the spatial distribution) on the retrieved base and monitor reflection responses as well as their induced amplitude differences. We show that, for a sufficient number of sources with sufficient durations, the accuracy of the retrieved reflection responses from the CO2 reservoir are close enough to the reference responses from an active surface shot. More generally, the retrieved reflections are improved when more sources lie at or close to stationary points. In addition, when the sources characteristics are identical for both the base and the monitor passive experiments, the amplitude differences between the retrieved base and monitor reflection responses exhibit clear information on reflection changes from the reservoir. However we show that, when the sources\u2019 characteristics, such as their spatial random distribution only, are not close enough for the base and the monitor passive experiments, the induced amplitude differences are difficult to interpret. Processing of the recorded body-wave noise prior to cross-correlation might be then necessary. We conclude that the repeatability of the passive noise is crucial for time-lapse interpretation. Finally, we choose an ideal noise configuration to enhance repeatability of the passive experiments when using different random distributions of the sources. In this special case, plotting picked amplitudes from the retrieved reflection responses for different velocity scenarios illustrates the potential of monitoring the velocity changes from SI with ambient noise.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "da404f9bbf86891e3b5a6408a00801340e1a646d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2238967988", "CorpusId": 139008701}, "title": "Physicochemical study of absorption of CO2 into electric arc furnace slag", "abstract": "Increase in the COz concentration in atmosphere due to the combustion of fossil fuels has \ncaused serious global warming.

It was found that \nCOz was not decomposed during the grinding, but the sorption of it occurred on the ground \nsample. In both cases of CaO and waste concrete, formation of CaC03 was confirmed. While, \nin the case of metal powders, the COz absorption into ground powders was firstly occurred, \nthereafter, it decomposed to form metal oxides and carbon. COz sorption into the samples \ndepended on the newly exposed surface area that was formed by grinding. It was found that \nthe newly exposed surface area increased linearly with the increase in the grinding time. \nHowever, the dry grinding resulted to the agglomeration of particles in the latter stage of \ngrinding. The agglomeration of particles has then led to the limitation of the COz absorption. \nIn the next stage, the behavior of C02 absorption into EAF normal and stainless steel \nreducing slag was investigated with wet grinding method. The slag was wet ground under \nCOz atmosphere by a vibrating ball mill which has larger capacity than the centrifugal ball \nmill. The amount and the initial rate of C02 absorption for the wet grinding were higher than \nthose for the dry grinding. The optimum ratio of fillings to vessel's volume was found to be \naboct 112. C02 was stored into the slag mainly as CaC03 and EO desorption of C02 was \nobserved. Thus, this indicates that the C02 can be stored permanently inside the slag with this \nmethod. This study also revealed that the increase in the interfacial area between COz and the \nslurry of water and slag was necessary to enhance COz absorption. It was found that the \nabsorption capacity of C02 into the normal and stainless steel reducing slag using this method \non the most optimum grinding condition was 0.21 and 0.3 1 kg CO~lkgsl ag respectively. \nTo profoundly investigate the mechanism of COz absorption, study on the absorption \nbehavior of C02 into EAF normal and stainless steel oxidizing slag with wet grinding method was also conducted. The results showed that the conversion ratio of CaO to CaC03 was not \nsolely affected by the CaO content in the slag, but by the CaO/A1203 ratio in the slag. The \nconversion ratio linearly increased with the increase in the Ca01A1203 ratio. The rate of CO2 \nabsorption in the slag with wet grinding method was highly depended on the dissolution \nbehavior of ca2+ ion from the slag into water and the interfacial area between the COz gas and \nwater. The rate increased with the increase in the both factors. The dissolution behavior of \n2+ . Ca d.~ fferedb etween each slags depended on the main phases reaction in the slag. Thus, the \nmain phases in each slags affected the overall reaction of the C02 absorption. The \n2Ca0.A1203.Si02 was found to hinder the absorption of CO2 into the slag. While CaO.Si02 \nand 2Ca0.Si02 phases in the slag were favorable for the CO2 absorption. It was found that \nthe absorption quantity of CO2 into the stainless steel oxidizing slag with low A1203 content \non the most optimum grinding condition was about 0.26 kg CO&g slag.

The United States oil and gas industry has a long experience in transporting, injecting, and effectively storing CO2 in tertiary oil recovery operations usually known as Enhanced Oil Recovery. As a result, there already exists a legal and regulatory framework that addresses many - but not all - of the issues that will need to be addressed if carbon capture and storage is to be adopted by policymakers as part of a carbon regulation regime. A review of that existing framework allows identification of those aspects that appear adequate to govern the sale, transport, and injection of CO2 for carbon capture and storage purposes as well as those that do not. Building on this analysis, the authors conclude that the current legal framework will be largely adequate from a transactional and interim standpoint to allow parties to structure a relatively seamless transition from CO2 storage that is an incidental result of oil production operations to those incremental injections of CO2 intended solely for permanent underground storage. The authors also suggest some possible approaches for crafting new rules to fill potentially remaining legal or regulatory gaps. I. INTRODUCTION In recent years, an increasing number of governments around the world have begun to regulate atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) in one fashion or another. Others, including the United States, are actively debating whether to implement carbon regulation,1 and if so, under what terms and conditions. One potentially important tool for reducing CO2 emissions is the separation and \"capture\" of the CO2 produced in the generation of electricity from coal; piping it to storage sites where it would be injected for permanent storage in underground geological formations. This process is known as carbon capture and storage or \"CCS\" (sometimes also referred to as \"carbon capture and sequestration\" or \"carbon capture and disposal\"). While interest in CCS is relatively new, the underground injection and effective storage of large quantities of CO2 is not. As explained below, the United States' oil and gas industry has been transporting CO2 by pipeline for injection as a tertiary, or enhanced oil recovery (EOR) technique, for nearly forty years.2 In addition, significant quantities of CO2 have been piped to industrial facilities for use in various processes as well as for distribution by rail or truck to large numbers of CO2 end users nationwide. As a result, there is already in place a CO2 industry infrastructure comprising over approximately 13,000 permitted CO2 injections wells (over 6,000 of which are active) and thousands of miles of CO2 pipeline with associated CO2 handling facilities, all of which represents a major investment of private financial and intellectual capital. Estimates of the amount of CO2 injected each year in American EOR activities are in excess of fifty million metric tonnes,3 with cumulative injections since 1972 estimated at over 600 million metric tonnes.4 The current annual injection quantity is thus roughly equivalent to the amount of CO2 that might be captured from the first twenty newly constructed 500 MW coal-fired power plants that capture eighty percent of their CO2 output.5 This CO2 is currently being injected through over 6,100 active injection wells6 and makes possible daily oil production of about 245,000 barrels.7 While the majority of current CO2 supply comes from naturally-occurring geologic formations that have been developed much like an oil or gas field, the C02-based EOR business originated in the 1970s with anthropogenic sources of CO2 and even today some CO2 supply remains anthropogenic in origin, captured by separation from natural gas production or from certain industrial facilities. Moreover, while EOR operations strive to recycle and reuse the maximum amount possible of the initially-injected CO2, a large percentage of the injected CO2 - on the order of fifty percent or more8 - cannot be recovered for reuse under current technology and remains stored in the underground formation as an incident of the oil production operation. \u2026", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "d0960e1c5938fd38872513db9bf5be7121baa15b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2065049465", "DOI": "10.1088/1755-1307/6/17/172025", "CorpusId": 128562742}, "title": "A geothermal site combined with C02-storage", "abstract": "Introduction: Following two geothermal projects in Bleiswijk (for glashouses,1700 m depth) and the Hague (6000 houses), students of Delft University, Department of Applied Earth Sciences, started a feasibility study where casing drilling with composite pipe and CO 2-injection are combined with the production of geothermal energy. An anticlinal structure is present below the campus, which holds the Jurassic aged Rijswijk and Delft highly permeable sandstone members at a depth between 1.8 and 2.4 km. This member can produce about 150 m 3 of water per hour at 75\u00b0 C. In urban environments, small operational footprints are essential for drilling a productionand a CO 2injection well (Fig.1a). By using new light-weight composite materials for wells with casing drilling technology, only small drilling rigs are required. The composite material is less susceptible to corrosion and enables co-injection of CO 2 with the returning water (Wolf et al. 2007). Geology: Several hydrocarbon exploration wells have been drilled around Delft, of which one on the University Campus. 2D and 3D seismic have been shot to primarily explore the regionally oil bearing Rijswijk formation above the Delft sandstones. The sands are part of the Upper Delfland formation and of Upper Jurassic (Kimmeridge) age. The overburden (1650 m) consists of mainly Cretaceous, Tertiary and Quaternary chalks, limestones, claystones, clays, siltstones, and sandstones. The target Delft sandstone for heat production and CO 2 storage is composed of sheets of amalgamated transgressive and coastal-barrier sands, rapidly alternating with clays, which were deposited on a Late-Kimmeridgian discordance. The 3D seismic shows an anticlinal structure of the Rijswijk sandstone member (fig 1b) covered by the mentioned sediments. No major structural phenomena, like faults, block faulting, erosion planes, etc., do cross the Delft sandstone in the area of interest. First studies by Smits (2008), de Boer (2008) and Eldert (2008) show promising reservoir qualities for the sandstone member; high permeability and porosity. Based on the petrophysics of the neighboring wells, the geothermal prognosis and reservoir properties for the area have been reconstructed: 1) At a depth of 2300 m, it is expected to produce water with a temperature of about 75\u00b0C. 2) A productionand injection rate over 150 m /hr should be feasible. 3) With carefully planned productionand injection wells, the original warm water and colder CO 2-saturated re-injected water will not interfere for at least 30 years (fig. 1c). The local geology of small oilfields shows that geothermal heat production and CO2-storage options in the sandstone members are positive; i.e. a potential large reservoir volume with high permeabilities and a proper seal. Surface Infrastructure and implementation of geothermal energy: The University Campus has an on-site79 MW power plant with two cogeneration units for base-load and three gas boilers for peak demand. The geothermal heat will contribute up to 5 MW continuously (95000 GJ), cutting CO 2 emission with 5000 tons annually, while reducing costs for base-load heat production. For optimal heat gain, the productionand injection well should be co-located with the power-plant. This gives spatial constrains on operations and the drilling of 2.5 km deep large-diameter holes with heavy equipment should be avoided. Unconventional Drilling: The casing drilling with composite pipe here introduced finds its origin at Delft University and is further developed by an industrial consortium (Acquit BV). It resulted in a light weight concept where a composite casing pipe is combined with the casing drilling methodology. This almost buoyant casing pipe needs considerably less working space and existing civil pile drilling units can be used to drill wells (Leijnse, 2008). The composite casing pipe has a better insulation, improved skin and a better endurance for corrosion (CO 2-rich return water). Further, for monitoring, it is possible to implement P,Tsensors. Overall construction and operation costs can be significantly reduced, but the composite casing will be more expensive. Second phase CO 2-Injection Delft University has applied for the geothermal exploration license under and around its campus grounds. The \u201cfirst phase\u201d exploration is focusing on the construction of a normal geothermal system. In the second phase, a research program for CO 2 capture and storage will be realized. For removing the CO 2 from the power plants\u2019 flue gas, several capture techniques are studied. One of the options is adding CO 2 at low pressure (about 20 bar) as being 10% of the re-injected water volume (Smits, 2008). Gas can diffuse into the water achieving undersaturated conditions before it reaches the target member.

Now more and more, researchers see it as one possible option to achieve long-term stabilization of carbon dioxide concentrations. \"This is the impulse from Kyoto. Suddenly, things come up that were unthinkable a couple of years ago,\" explained Baldur Eliasson, head of the Energy and Global Change section of ABB Corporate Research, Ltd., in Baden, Switzerland. Projects that offer economic benefit, such as using captured C02 for enhanced oil recovery or enhanced coalbed methane recovery, are being actively pursued. In Norway, advanced membrane absorption techniques for capture of C02 from offshore gas turbines are being developed. Financial benefit is being achieved by circumventing the country's high carbon taxes. A similar capture technique, which aims to separate C02 from cogeneration power plants and then to sell the gas to greenhouse owners, is being explored in The Netherlands. The most prominent new development project in power generation technology is under way in Norway. The huge energy, chemicals, and metals conglomerate Norsk Hydro is planning a 1300megawatt (MW) installed capacity hydrogen power plant. Almost three times the power-generating capacity of a standard European power plant, it will produce 10% of Norway's electricity. The facility will be built at Karmoy, on the country's west coast. Underground storage of C02 is currently the most advanced storage option. On the basis of two years' experience with C02 injection into an aquifer under the Norwegian North Sea, an international European research project is establishing guidelines for regulators\u2014a best-practices manual to help them make decisions about future injection projects.

The objective of this thesis is to present several methods and processes to separate carbon dioxide from flue gases for sustainable sequestration. As a result the increase of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere by emission can be reduced. The sequestration can either be terrestrial or marine. There are four options for terrestrial sequestration: 1) in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, 2) in saline formations and aquifers, 3) in minerals and 4) in unminable coal seams. For marine storage the carbon dioxide either dissolves in the seawater or forms lakes of hydrates in depths below 3000m. Health, safety and environmental issues have to be considered seriously. First of all, it is necessary to capture the carbon dioxide from the flue gas after combustion, in order to optimize the utilization of limited storage capacities. When capturing carbon dioxide the following processes will be discussed: 1) absorption using monoethanolamine, 2) pressure swing adsorption, 3) gas separation membranes and 4) the carbonation-calcination process. These separation processes lead to intense facility costs, which undergo an economic evaluation in this thesis.

Degassing of CO2 and radon isotopes (222Rn-220Rn) from soil, gas vents and thermal water discharges was investigated in the natural analog of Campo de Calatrava Volcanic Field (CCVF; Central Spain) to determine the CO2-Rn relationships and to assess the role of CO2 as carrier gas for radon. Furthermore, radon measurements to discriminate between shallow and deep gas sources were evaluated under the perspective of their applicability in monitoring programs of carbon storage projects. C02 flux as high as 5000 gm-2d-1 and 222Rn activities up to 430kBqm-3 were measured; 220Rn activities were one order of magnitude lower than those of 222Rn. The 222 Rnj220Rn ratios were used to constrain the source ofthe Campo de Calatrava soil gases since a positive correlation between radon isotopic ratios and CO2 fluxes was observed. Thus, in agreement with previous studies, our results indicate a deep mantle-related origin of CO2 for both free and soil gases, suggesting that carbon dioxide is an efficient carrier for Rn. Furthermore, it was ascertained that the increase of 222Rn in the soil gases was likely produced by two main processes: (i) direct transport by a carrier gas, Le., C02 and (ii) generation at shallow level due to the presence of relatively high concentrations of dissolved U and Ra in the thermal aquifer of Campo de Calatrava. The diffuse CO2 soil flux and radon isotopic surveys carried out in the Campo de Calatrava Volcanic Fields can also be applicable to geochemical monitoring programs in CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) areas as these parameters are useful to: (i) constrain C021eakages once detected and (ii) monitor both the evolution of the leakages and the effectiveness of subsequent remediation activities.

In oxy-combustion, CH4/0 2/CO 2 mixtures burn at low temperatures (~1700 K), high pressures (~40 bar), where laminar burning velocities are about 7 times lower than in traditional CH4 /Air mixtures. Thus oxy-fuel combustors are more prone to blowoff and dynamic instabilities. In this thesis we examine turbulent oxy-combustion flame stabilization physics at the large and small scales using experimental studies and numerical simulations. Experimental measurements are used to establish the stability characteristics of flame macrostructures in a swirl stabilized combustor. We show that the transition in the flame macrostructure to a flame stabilized along both the inner and outer shear layers (Flame IV), scales according to the extinction strain rate, similar to air flames. To achieve accurate scaling, extinction strain rates must be computed at the thermal conditions of the outer shear layer, emphasizing the role of heat interactions with the wall boundary layer. Care must be exercised while modeling the chemical structure of oxy-flames. We show that the kinetics of CO2 (used as a diluent in oxycombustion) is important in determining the consumption speed and flame extinction strain rate. Specifically, the extinction strain rate was found to be heavily impacted by the reaction C02+ H CO + OH. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) models, first validated for various combustor geometries, fuels and oxidizers, are used to examine the stabilization mechanisms of these flames. First, we demonstrate the importance of choosing the correct global chemical kinetics mechanism in predicting the flow structures in multi-dimensional simulations and develop a priori criterion of selecting a reduced mechanism based on the extinction strain rate. Besides flame macrostructures, recirculation zone lengths are found to linearly scale with extinction strain rates. This scaling holds regardless of fuel or oxidizer type, Reynold's number, inlet temperature, or combustor geometry. It is thus very important that a chemical mechanism is able to correctly predict extinction strain rates if it is to be used in CFD simulations. We use the validated LES 3 framework to model the transition to Flame IV in the swirl combustor for methane oxy-combustion mixtures. The 3D turbulent flame structure strongly resembles a ID strained adiabatic laminar flame structure in the combustor interior, and nonadiabatic flames near the combustor wall. The results support the earlier conclusions regarding the use of the extinction strain rate and the wall thermal boundary condition in scaling and modeling turbulent combustion dynamics.

How does potential future carbon legislation affect the decision to add carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology? Finally, can the impact of uncertain carbon legislation be minimized? We find that SO2, NOx, PM, and Hg emission standards would have to be far more stringent than twice current standards to justify the increased costs of the IGCC system. A C02 tax less than $29/ton would lead companies to continuing to choose PC, paying the tax for emitted CO2. The earlier a decision-maker believes the carbon tax will be imposed and the higher the tax, the more likely companies will choose IGCC w/CCS.

These are (i) the potential for increased C~ emissiom from soil under conditions of global wanning, giving rise co a positive feedback on the greenhouse effect (Jenkinson el al., 1991), (ii) increased emission of other radiatively-active trace gases from soil as a consequence of land management practices [(e.g .. greater N10 emission and less CH. consumption with increased N fcrtili~cr use (Bronson and Mosier, 1993; Robenson, 1993)], and (iii) the potential for increasing C storage in soils to explain wh.ac appears co be a contemporary midlatirude C01 sink of 1.3-2.4 Pg yr\u00b7 ' C (rans et al., 1990) and to help ameliorate furure increases of C02 in the atmosphere (Barnwell Ct al., 1992). In this paper we will examine processes determining the carbon balance in agriculrural soils. focusing in particular on the role of land managemem practices in influencing these processes. Our objectives are co provide a perspective on which practices are ~ost likely to be important for shifting the balance cowards greater storage of catbon ln soils and reducing the net emission of C01 and maximizing the net capture of ~ in soil, and w examine the interactions bccween managemeot and environmental controls on soil C ~r conditions of global clima.te change. ,:,. \\ .:: tJ.

La complexite intrinseque des systemes multiphasiques et l'heterogeneite des formations geologiques sur des echelles multiples representent un challenge majeur pour comprendre et modeliser les deplacements immiscibles dans les milieux poreux. Les descriptions a l'echelle superieure basees sur la generalisation de l'equation de Darcy sont largement utilisees, mais ces methodes sont sujettes a limitations pour les ecoulements presentant de l'hysterese. Les avancees recentes en terme de performances computationnelles et le developpement de methodes precises pour caracteriser l'espace interstitiel ainsi que la distribution des phases ont favorise l'utilisation de modeles qui permettent une resolution fine a l'echelle du pore. Ces modeles offrent un apercu des caracteristiques de l'ecoulement qui ne peuvent pas etre facilement observees en laboratoire et peuvent etre utilise pour expliquer la difference entre les processus physiques et les modeles a l'echelle macroscopique existants. L'objet premier de la these se porte sur la simulation numerique directe : les equations de Navier-Stokes sont resolues dans l'espace interstitiel et la methode du volume de fluide (VOF) est employee pour suivre l'evolution de l'interface. Dans VOF, la distribution des phases est decrite par une fonction fluide pour l'ensemble du domaine et des conditions aux bords particulieres permettent la prise en compte des proprietes de mouillage du milieu poreux.\nDans la premiere partie de la these, nous simulons le drainage dans une cellule Hele-Shaw 2D avec des obstacles cylindriques. Nous montrons que l'approche proposee est applicable meme pour des ratios de densite et de viscosite tres importants et permet de modeliser la transition entre deplacement stable et digitation visqueuse. Nous interessons ensuite a l'interpretation de la pression capillaire a l'echelle macroscopique. Nous montrons que les techniques basees sur la moyenne spatiale de la pression presentent plusieurs limitations et sont imprecises en presence d'effets visqueux et de piegeage. Au contraire, une definition basee sur l'energie permet de separer les contributions capillaires des effets visqueux. La seconde partie de la these est consacree a l'investigation des effets d'inertie associes aux reconfigurations irreversibles du menisque cause par l'interface des instabilites. Comme prototype pour ces phenomenes, nous etudions d'abord la dynamique d'un menisque dans un pore angulaire. Nous montrons que, dans un reseau de pores cubiques, les sauts et reconfigurations sont si frequents que les effets d'inertie menent a differentes configurations des fluides. A cause de la non-linearite du probleme, la distribution des fluides influence le travail des forces de pression, qui, a son tour, provoque une chute de pression dans la loi de Darcy. Cela suggere que ces phenomenes devraient etre pris en compte lorsque que l'on decrit l'ecoulement multiphasique en media poreux a l'echelle macroscopique. La derniere partie de la these s'attache a demontrer la validite de notre approche par une comparaison avec des experiences en laboratoire : un drainage instable dans un milieu poreux quasi 2D (une cellule Hele-Shaw avec des obstacles cylindriques). Plusieurs simulations sont tournees sous differentes conditions aux bords et en utilisant differents modeles (modele integre 2D et modele 3D) afin de comparer certaines quantites macroscopiques avec les observations au laboratoire correspondantes. Malgre le challenge de modeliser des deplacements instables, ou, par definition, de petites perturbations peuvent grandir sans fin, notre approche numerique apporte de resultats satisfaisants pour tous les cas etudies.\n-\nProblems involving multiphase flow in porous media are of great interest in many scientific and engineering applications including Carbon Capture and Storage, oil recovery and groundwater remediation. The intrinsic complexity of multiphase systems and the multi scale heterogeneity of geological formations represent the major challenges to understand and model immiscible displacement in porous media. Upscaled descriptions based on generalization of Darcy's law are widely used, but they are subject to several limitations for flow that exhibit hysteric and history- dependent behaviors. Recent advances in high performance computing and the development of accurate methods to characterize pore space and phase distribution have fostered the use of models that allow sub-pore resolution. These models provide an insight on flow characteristics that cannot be easily achieved by laboratory experiments and can be used to explain the gap between physical processes and existing macro-scale models. We focus on direct numerical simulations: we solve the Navier-Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation in the pore space and employ the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) method to track the evolution of the interface. In the VOF the distribution of the phases is described by a fluid function (whole-domain formulation) and special boundary conditions account for the wetting properties of the porous medium. In the first part of this thesis we simulate drainage in a 2-D Hele-Shaw cell filled with cylindrical obstacles. We show that the proposed approach can handle very large density and viscosity ratios and it is able to model the transition from stable displacement to viscous fingering. We then focus on the interpretation of the macroscopic capillary pressure showing that pressure average techniques are subject to several limitations and they are not accurate in presence of viscous effects and trapping. On the contrary an energy-based definition allows separating viscous and capillary contributions. In the second part of the thesis we investigate inertia effects associated with abrupt and irreversible reconfigurations of the menisci caused by interface instabilities. As a prototype of these phenomena we first consider the dynamics of a meniscus in an angular pore. We show that in a network of cubic pores, jumps and reconfigurations are so frequent that inertia effects lead to different fluid configurations. Due to the non-linearity of the problem, the distribution of the fluids influences the work done by pressure forces, which is in turn related to the pressure drop in Darcy's law. This suggests that these phenomena should be taken into account when upscaling multiphase flow in porous media. The last part of the thesis is devoted to proving the accuracy of the numerical approach by validation with experiments of unstable primary drainage in a quasi-2D porous medium (i.e., Hele-Shaw cell filled with cylindrical obstacles). We perform simulations under different boundary conditions and using different models (2-D integrated and full 3-D) and we compare several macroscopic quantities with the corresponding experiment. Despite the intrinsic challenges of modeling unstable displacement, where by definition small perturbations can grow without bounds, the numerical method gives satisfactory results for all the cases studied.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "3fd794572019dabb2c19eafba8afd850b9e3753f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2044593177", "DOI": "10.1021/CEN-V083N040.P011A", "CorpusId": 110283861}, "title": "Compressing, Storing CO 2 Could Minimize Climate Change", "abstract": "Capturing and storing the carbon dioxide generated by power plants and factories could help mitigate climate change, says a United Nations report approved on Sept. 25.

Recently completed investigations of reduced gravity slosh behavior have demonstrated the limitations of utilizing parabolic flights on specialized aircraft with respect to the specific objectives of the experiments. Although valuable data was collected, the benefits of longer duration low-gravity environments were clearly established. The proposed research provides the first data set from long duration tests in zero gravity that can be directly used to benchmark CFD models, including the interaction between the sloshing fluid and the tank/vehicle dynamics. To explore the coupling of liquid slosh with the motion of an unconstrained tank in microgravity, NASA's Kennedy Space Center, Launch Services Program has teamed up with the Florida Institute of Technology (FIT), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and the NASA Game Changing Development Program (GCD) to perform a series of slosh dynamics experiments on the International Space Station using the SPHERES platform. The Synchronized Position Hold Engage Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) testbed provides a unique, free-floating instrumented platform on ISS that can be utilized in a manner that would solve many of the limitations of the current knowledge related to propellant slosh dynamics on launch vehicle and spacecraft fuel tanks. The six degree of freedom (6-DOF) motion of the SPHERES free-flyer is controlled by an array of cold-flow C02 thrusters, supplied from a built-in liquid C02 tank. These SPHERES can independently navigate and re-orient themselves within the ISS. The intent of this project is to design an externally mounted tank to be driven inside the ISS by a set of two SPHERES devices (Figure 1). The tank geometry simulates a launch vehicle upper stage propellant tank and the maneuvers replicate those of real vehicles. The design includes inertial sensors, data acquisition, image capture and data storage interfaces to the SPHERES VERTIGO computer system on board the flight article assembly.

During the immature stage DCs endocytose fluids and particles from the surrounding interstitial environment, such as the skin, deeper organs, and mucous membranes. Maturity is reached after antigen uptake stimulates the loading of foreign peptides on their major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) molecules, which then are expressed on the cell surface. DCs cease antigen uptake and presentation at some point after the uptake of a maturation stimulus (antigen); at this point the DC is fully mature. It has been estimated that these cells have a 24 hour maturation period. However, recent experiments suggest that this period is longer than 24 hours. Introduction: Dendritic cells (also called Langer hans cells) are found in the peripheral fluid of organs and mucous membranes (Funnel 2002). DCs develop from cells known as nonproli:ferating precursors, which in turn have evolved from proliferating progenitor cells, which are located mainly in the bone marrow (Steinman et al. 1999). Fig 1 These flourescently-tagged DCs exemplify the branching, \"dendritic\" nature of this type of cell (Mellman et al. 1998). A DC is characterized by its stellate or dendritic (branching) shape (Fig 1). It has a dark nucleus and clear cytoplasm, within which can be found Birbeck granules, whose function are currently under study(Funnel 2002). In the immature stage, a DC circulates throughout tissues and lymphoid organs, endocytosing material such as self antigens and proteins from its surroundings (Steinman and Nuzzen 2001 ). An immature DC is stimulated to begin maturation upon endocytosis of a stimulating antigen, (a foreign substance) such as bacterial peptides. Stimulated epidermal DCs leave the skin and migrate to draining lymph nodes via lymphatic vessels upon bacterial invasion (Shartman 2000) where they initiate an immune response by stimulating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (Morrow 2001). Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules are used by DCs to capture and present peptides to T -cells. Class I molecules predominantly bind peptides from endogenously synthesized cytosolic proteins and class II molecules present peptides derived from internalized degraded material (Nordeng et al. 1996). During the intermediate stage of maturation, the DC processes and loads the antigen's peptides onto its MHC II molecules and transports them to the cell surface (Mellman et al. 1998). Once the DC has completed its task of processing and loading large numbers of the antigen peptides it is considered a mature cell (Banchereau and Steinman 1998) like the one in Figure 2. In this mature state, the peptides presented on its MHC II loaded membrane can be found and Fig 2: As dendritic cells mature, antigens are loaded onto MHC II molecules and sent to the surface of the membrane for presentation. In these pictures, MHC II molecules are stained green, and can be seen to emerge on the membrane as the cell goes from (a) the immature state to (b) the intermediate state, and finally to (c) the mature state (Mellman et al. 200 1 ). recognized by lymph node T cells. The branched shape of the DC provides more surface area for presentation of peptide toT cells (Mellman and Steinman 2001). Each helper T cell (T H) has its own specific T cell receptor designed for a single ligand. Helper T cells are attracted by the chemochines released by the DC and are activated when they encounter this specific combination ofMHC II and antigen peptide (Cyster et al. 2000). Once stimulated, the bound T cell releases interleukin-2 (IL-2) to stimulate other T cells in the vicinity, initiating a larger immune system response. The time period between initial stimulation and complete maturation has not been determined, but has been estimated to be about 24 hours (Inaba et al. 1992). The purpose of this study is to determine the maturation time for an antigen stimulated DC. Pigeon cytochrome C (PCC) is used as the antigen. The cessation of endocytosis acts is the indicator of maturation (Mellman and Steinman 2001 ). Dendritic cell study is spread throughout many areas of medical research. Specialized DC therapy may play a role in preventing post-donation organ rejection by interacting with donorreactive T cells to minimize rejection side effects (Takayama et al. 1999). DCs may play a role in vaccines against cancer (Curti et al. 2001). Researchers hope to use DCs to fight tumors by isolating patient DCs, culturing/priming them with tumor antigen, and then vaccinating the patient with their \"educated\" DCs (Skin Cancer Foundation 2002). DCs may someday help HIV, AIDS, and other patients with immunosuppressive conditions, battle infections against opportunistic fungi. Success has already been achieved against the fungus Pneumocystis carinii (Ashkenas 2001). Research is underway for using DCs to vaccinate against multiple myeloma (Yi et a1. 2001 ). DCs could someday help prevent or treat diabetes. Specially engineered DCs may be used to destroy T-cells which are killing the host's insulin-producing cells (Rossi 2002). However, much research remains to be conducted before these procedures can be optimized. This is why further research on the details of DC behavior, such as maturation timing, is so badly needed. Materials and Methods: Cell Line: In these experiments AND3 hybridoma T cells were used to recognize I-Ek MHC class II molecules expressing PCC 98\u2022104 (the segment of processed PCC peptide containing amino acids 98 through 104) on the cell membrane. Dendritic cell strain C3D2F1 was used because it could present 1-Ek MHC class II molecules. These DCs therefore had the potential ofbeing fed PCC and presenting the peptides on I-Ek MHC II molecules in a manner that could stimulate AND3 T cells to release IL-2. DCs were isolated in the lab from mouse bone marrow, following lab protocol by Inaba et al(1992). T H cells were hybridomas (modified T cells that were fused with AND3 lymphoma cells)(Pharmingen) to ensure cell immortality. T cell hybridomas were cultured in RPMI (a culture media named after the Roswell Park Memorial Institute) 1640 (Gibco) with I 0% heat-inactivated FCS (fetal calf serum), 2mM L-glutamine (Gibco ), 1mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco), 1 mM non-essential amino acids (Gibco), 0.75 mM essential amino acids (Gibco), 50 mM BME (basal medium eagle's) (Sigma), 0.075 glucose (Gibco), and lOmM HEPES (N-2Hydroxyethylpiperazine-N' -2-ethanesulfonic acid) (Gibco ). Cells were incubated at 5% COH2, 37\u00b0C. Cells were given fresh media every other day. Cell thawing: Dendritic cells had been frozen for storage in 1.0 ml vials containing approximately lxl 07 dendritic cells. Cell vials were removed from liquid nitrogen and placed immediately on ice, to prevent shock during their transition from the storage room to the water bath area. Vials were shaken in a 37\u00b0C water bath until all but a small ice pellet thawed. Cells were then placed in cold growth media, allowed to sit on ice for 5 minutes, then centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes. After aspirating the media, cells were re-suspended at a concentration of 2x1 0 by first tapping in residual media and then adding warmed growth media. Antigen Presentation: Antigen presentation assays were done by exposing post-maturation-stimulated DCs to antigen molecules at intervals between 0 and 24+ hours and washing out antigen three hours later following preparation, buffering, and concentrations as described in the antigen presentation laboratory protocol by Buus et al(1986). Intervals varied for each assay; the first covered from 2 to 10 hours after exposure, the second from 14 to 28 hours, the third from 24 to 3 6 hours, and the fourth from 6 to 20 hours. DCs were first given LPS (lipopolysaccharide: a bacterial membrane component extracted from L. monocytogenes), or ovalbumin as their maturation stimulus. These samples were then each pulsed with PCC, (which also contains LPS) at intervals between 0 and 36 hours. T cells responsible for recognizing antigen-loaded MHC lis were immediately added to DCs at a 1:1 ratio and incubated at 37\u00b0C, 5% C02 for 24 hours. In this experiment, presentation of PCC was tested by antigen presentation assays using the AND3 hybridoma T cells, which released IL-2 when stimulated by contact with presented PCC peptides. Levels ofhybridoma activation were measured by averaging anti-IL2 ELISA concentrations from all the wells of each time period or standard, a total which represented the antigen presentation of approximately 90 DCs per group. Cluster disruption technique: In later experiments it became necessary to ensure that all DCs had truly received a maturation stimulus at the same time. As an additional maturations stimulus, a P1000 pipet was used to triturate DC samples ten times three hours after the addition of antigen. This disturbance stimulated the cells to enter the intermediate phase without antigen uptake. ELISA: Twenty-four-hour supernatants from antigen presentation (AP) assays were collected by micropipet and transferred to fresh plates after centrifugation of the original plates at 1500 RPM for 5 minutes. Supernatants were frozen at -80\u00b0C overnight before use. Anti-IL-2 ELISA protocol was followed according to manufacturer instructions (Pharmingen) to measure T cell stimulation. Plates were read with an optical density of 450 nm. Antigens/reagents: Anti-CD3, anti-CD28, anti-IL-2 (biotinylated and unconjugated) were obtained from Pharmingen; PMA (phorbol-myristate-acetate), calcium ionophore, ovalbumin, PCC, and LPS were purchased from Sigma. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase was from Zymed. Controls: Each experiment's plate contained wells with several positive and negative controls for both dendritic cells and T cells. Positive DC controls included maturation only by PCC to ensure that these DCs were indeed capable of processing", "year": 2003}]}
