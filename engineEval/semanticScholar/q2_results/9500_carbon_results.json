The emission of CO 2 gas, which is a green house gas, as a result of this combustion has led to increase in CO 2 concentration in atmosphere. Carbon sequestration can be defined as the reduction of CO 2 by capture from the point sources like power plants and subsurface storage. The subsurface CO 2 storage can be achieved by injection of CO 2 for sequestration in aquifers by means of mineral trapping and hydrodynamic trapping (Gunter et al., 1996), depleted oil and gas reservoirs by taking advantage of naturally available seal, coal seams, or viscous oil recovery by CO 2 flooding. According to EPA\u2019s Energy CO 2 inventory, the state of Alaska emitted 41 Million tons of CO 2 during the year of 2000. The combustion of fossil fuels from industrial and electric utilities contributed around 20 Million tons to the total CO 2 emissions.

The long-term climate goal set by the Swedish Government is that Sweden should be climate-neutral by Year 2045, i.e., that net emissions from Swedish sources should be zero. Large Swedish point sources of fossil CO2 emissions include oil refineries, integrated steel mills, cement and chemical production plants. However, the majority of the large point sources of CO2 are pulp and integrated pulp and paper mills, with their emissions being primarily of biogenic origin. Due to the magnitude of emissions from the pulp and paper industry, there is significant potential for negative emissions by means of BECCS. This work assesses the investment cost and CO2 reduction potential of carbon capture from the Swedish process industry. The capital cost for CO2 capture is estimated for a standard MEA-based CO2 absorption process. The CO2 absorption process is applied to key industries \u2013 pulp and paper, oil and gas, steel, cement and chemical production \u2013using process modelling for design and cost estimates. The capital cost (CAPEX) is subsequently estimated using a detailed individual factor estimation method. The treated volume flow of gases and the flue gas CO2 concentration are important factors in determining the cost of CO2 capture. For a given volume flow, the higher the CO2 concentration the higher the investment cost, owing to the increased flows of liquid solvent and captured CO2. Operating expenditures (OPEX), which are dominated by the cost of heat supply for solvent regeneration, but also include other utilities, maintenance, and labour, are evaluated with the assumption that all utilities are delivered by external systems. Waste heat utilization is estimated based on the type of industry, but not considering for individual industrial plants. This approach is used to exemplify the effects of OPEX on the total CO2 capture cost and its sensitivity to economic assumptions. Costs for transport and storage are taken from literature for conditions relevant for storage near Sweden and added to the capture cost in order to obtain estimates of the total CCS cost. Figure 1 gives the cumulative investment as a function of the system capacity for annual reduction in CO2 through CCS, including both CO2 capture and transport. The sources are sorted in ascending order of specific CAPEX. A considerable reduction in CO2 emissions can be achieved by targeting the large point sources that have a specific CAPEX <20 \u20ac/tCO2, around 12.5 MtCO2/a, at a cumulative investment cost for capture of roughly 2,000 M\u20ac, or an average specific CAPEX of 17 \u20ac/tCO2. Swedish steel mills, cement plants, and the recovery boilers of large pulp mills are shown to offer low, specific investment costs (10\u201320 \u20ac/tCO2). Furthermore, considering the significant levels of biomass-related emissions that emanate from the relatively numerous large pulp mills in Sweden, there is significant potential for implementing BECCS. The potential for achieving negative CO2 emissions from the recovery boilers of the pulp mills included in this study amounts to 13.6 MtCO2/a", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "4db84c452b3cc270f1477e278946a73c87a17205", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2965258946", "CorpusId": 201304194}, "title": "CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE (CCS) IS EXPECTED TO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN MEETING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "2e6c01019acb4113b031d297f690ed2827075d50", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2741626618", "DOI": "10.1007/s13762-017-1475-z", "CorpusId": 103144275}, "title": "Ammonia emission from CO2 capture pilot plant using aminoethylethanolamine", "abstract": "Amine post-combustion carbon capture technology is based on washing the flue gas with a solvent that captures CO2.

First, we show a simple volumetric equation that gives the CO2 storage capacity in a depleted gas reservoir, which considers the same volume of CH4 at reservoir pressure and temperature conditions produced from the reservoir. Next, the validity and the limitations of this equation are investigated using a numerical reservoir simulation with the various reservoir characteristics of reservoir heterogeneity, aquifer water encroachment, and rock compaction and its reversibility. Regardless of the reservoir heterogeneity, if a reservoir is subjected to a weak or moderate aquifer support, the volumetric equation provides an estimate of the CO2 storage capacity as structurally trapped gas within 1% of that estimated from numerical simulations. The most significant factor influencing the CO2 storage capacity is the reversibility of rock compaction, rather than the degree of rock compaction. If reservoir rocks have a strong hysteresis in their compaction and expansion behaviour, the material balance equation will overestimate the amount of structural CO2 trapping. All the simulation results show a fairly consistent amount of trapped CO2 as a dissolved component in water, which is 15%\u223c17% of the structurally trapped CO2.

In contrast, the record from the earliest known metasedimentary rocks, extending back in time beyond 3.86 Ga show sequences of banded ironstones without the extensive mechanical disturbances that might be expected from planetary scale impacts. These rocks, and others like them which are slightly younger, also contain ubiquitous chemofossils with carbon isotopic composition suggestive of biochemically advanced microbial life forms (Mojzsis et al., 1996). These conflicting observations together with new data obtained from the studies of the martian meteorites require a re-evaluation of the events in Earth-Moon space in this critical time interval. Two possibilities exist. The bombardment, if assumed to have been caused by invading objects from outer space, could have been sufficiently episodic so that the effects have been missed in the discontinuous sequences investigated from the early Archaean. Life could in each of the occult major impact events have been extinguished only to arise again in the intervening quiescent time intervals of a few ten or hundred million years. Or it could have found a niche for survival in the deep ocean or crust, and spread again from there between each pair of major assaults (Sleep et al., 1989). The other possibility, supported by the lack of observable effects on Earth and Mars, is that the late lunar bombardment was not a solar system-wide process, but was largely limited to the lunar orbit. If the Moon formed from material ejected at impact between Earth and another planet, complete accretion of this material could have been delayed inside the Roche limit and by metastable storage in the Lagrangian points of the Moon's orbit, and the impacting bodies could have been such delayed residual material fiom the formation of the Moon. If the Moon was captured from solar orbit (Gerstenkorn, 1955), the late impactors could have been a set of appropriately small original satellites of Earth, swept up as the Moon, receded from Earth in its present prograde orbit (Alfvbn and Arrhenius, 1972), In any of these cases the impact velocities, because of the similarity in orbital elements could have been sufficiently low to retain the ejecta below escape velocity, and with escaping material, unless perturbed, returning to the orbital points of ejection, minimizing capture by Earth. Contributing to the concept of the late lunar bombardment as a parochial lunar event (Mojzsis, 1998) is the observation that the Martian surface, if represented by the meteorite ALH 84001, has not been remelted since the cts, stallization age of 4.5 Ga. All of the processes discussed above are highly speculative and each one suffers from dynamic difficulties. However, their main features can be experimentally tested. If the objects bombarding the Moon were derived from outer space or from the asteroid belt, the impact debris on the Moon as well as any captured by the Earth should be recognizable from its characteristic transition metal signature; initial results of a search for platinum group elements in the oldest Archaean metasediments are reported by Mojzsis (1998); a con-esponding search of the lunar impact material is planned.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "77bf2679f8bb5a7be709087b8e1c940db76481a7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2944401743", "DOI": "10.1007/s10653-019-00318-2", "CorpusId": 148569440, "PubMed": "31069597"}, "title": "CO2 capture through electro-conductive adsorbent using physical adsorption system for sustainable development", "abstract": "The most critical energy and environmental challenge that our planet is facing today is to minimize the dependence on fossil fuels.

Activated carbon (AC) adsorption is one the most effective, environment friendly and techno-economic process for the carbon capture. In the current research, an electro-conductive-activated carbon was prepared by mixing powdered activated carbon (PAC) with an electro-conductive polymer (ECP). Different ratios of 0, 25, 50, 75 and 100\u00a0wt% of ECP with PAC were used for the different analyses of activated carbons in a gas mixture of CO2/N2 using a physical adsorption system. Adsorption and desorption analyses, capacities of the process and desorption effects were examined. Electro-conductive polymers (ECP) were mixed with AC samples, where breakthrough time was increased up to 400% when mixed with the PAC for CO2 adsorption. Following adsorption analysis, desorption of activated carbons was conducted with different potentials. It was revealed that mixing could help the PAC sample to overcome the packing issue to increase the breakthrough capacity and the volumes before and after the breakthrough adsorption in the packed bed systems. The desorption rates of the PAC sample were also enhanced, and fast desorption was observed when mixed with ECP.

Our objective was to quantify soil organic carbon dynamics during a 9-year period in four irrigated, cotton-based cropping systems sown on permanent beds in a Vertosol with restricted subsoil drainage near Narrabri in north-western New South Wales, Australia. The experimental treatments were: cotton\u2013cotton (CC); cotton\u2013vetch (Vicia villosa Roth. in 2002\u201306, Vicia benghalensis L. in 2007\u201311) (CV); cotton\u2013wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), where wheat stubble was incorporated (CW); and cotton\u2013wheat\u2013vetch, where wheat stubble was retained as in-situ mulch (CWV). Vetch was terminated during or just before flowering by a combination of mowing and contact herbicides, and the residues were retained as in situ mulch. Estimates of carbon sequestered by above- and below-ground biomass inputs were in the order CWV\u2009>>\u2009CW\u2009=\u2009CV\u2009>\u2009CC. Carbon concentrations in the 0\u20131.2\u2009m depth and carbon storage in the 0\u20130.3 and 0\u20131.2\u2009m depths were similar among all cropping systems.

The discrepancy between measured and estimated values of sequestered carbon suggests that either the value of 5% used to estimate carbon sequestration from biomass inputs was an overestimate for this site, or post-sequestration losses may have been high.

Treatments in three replicates comprising manure-treated and chemical fertilizer-treated groups (two factors), each having seven sub-treatments of different combinations of inorganic nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and rice straw, were randomly distributed. Results showed that the treatments of manure (pig manure from 1980 to 1996 and oil rape cake thereafter) + N + P + K (MNPK) and chemical fertilizer + N + P + K (CNPK) produced the highest and the most stable yields for both rice and wheat within the respective fertilizer treatment group. Potassium fertilization was necessary for yield sustainability in the ecosystem. Treatments of straw (as rice straw) + N (CRN) and manure + straw + N (MRN) produced more stable yield of rice but less stable of wheat. It was therefore recommended that straw should be only incorporated during the rice season. SOC contents in all treatments showed increasing trends over the period, even in the control treatment. Predicted SOC in chemical fertilizer-treated plots (mostly yet attainable) ranged from 16 to 18\u00a0g C kg\u22121, indicating the high carbon (C) sequestration potential of the soil as compared to the initial SOC. SOC in manure- or straw-treated plots ranged from 17 to 19\u00a0g C kg\u22121, which had been attained roughly 10\u00a0years after the experiment was initiated. Nutrient balance sheet showed that there was P surplus in all P-treated plots and a steady increase in Olsen-P over a 24-year period in 0\u201315\u00a0cm soil, which contributed little to crop yield increases. It was therefore suggested that P fertilization rate should be decreased to 30\u201340\u00a0kg P ha\u22121 year\u22121. Comparison of yields among the treatments showed that wheat was more responsive to P fertilizer than rice. Thus P fertilizer should be preferably applied to wheat.

Some key technology development was also studied in this paper to gain some feeling about the technology development and application trend. Introduction In the oil depletion and global warming trends, how to reduce the Green House Gas (GHG) or carbon emission has become a major concern for everyone. According to the forecast by IEA [1], the carbon emission will reach 57GT in 2050. It is no doubt that global warming effect and climate anomalies has created great impact and deterioration to our living environment, the fluctuation of energy price also slow down and distortion the development of global economic. The issue about the energy and environment has become the most urgent problem need to be solved by our community. Most of the country already put their efforts to develop new energy technology, covered from the supply side to create new energy source and demand side to save energy. We need more actively to promote the development of the so-called low carbon technology or approach to reduce the carbon emission, such as adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, employment of renewable energy or alternative energy, improvement of energy efficiency, and/or application of nuclear power as shown in Figure-1. Then we can reach the vision for GHG deduction and sustainable development. In order to implement the low-carbon technologies, most of the country has set up the strategy to develop the so-called zero emission building or energy smart community as the major mission. Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) also fund a low carbon model town project to launch the low carbon town mission in APEC region through the development of low carbon town concept [2].

Among the pathways for reducing CO2 emissions is the application of carbon capture, transport and storage (CCS) technologies. This study undertakes a scoping-level evaluation of the economic viability of transport and storage location options for CO2 captured from an iron and steel plant located in Port Kembla, NSW, situated on the eastern coast of Australia. Both pipeline and ship transport of CO2 are considered, as well as two injection locations: the Darling Basin in NSW and the Gippsland Basin in the state of Victoria, Australia. The cost of CO2 transport and storage are estimated for four specific transport and storage options in south-east Australia, including the cost of pipelines/shipping, boosters, wells, other facilities, monitoring, energy and on-costs. The cases consider either a single CO2 source (emissions from Port Kembla) to a single pipeline or shipping port, or the contribution by the CO2 source from Port Kembla to a collection of CO2 sources including other CO2 sources in NSW, into a pipeline network. The sensitivity of the results to several economic and design parameters, such as flow rate, and project lifetime, is also assessed. \n \nScoping level cost estimates for transport and storage of the CO2 are lowest for the hub transport case injecting at the Gippsland basin and highest for the case involving shipping with injection in the Gippsland basin. For the single-source cases, transport via pipeline to the Darling basin is a slightly more attractive option in terms of unit costs. Although pipeline transport to both the Darling and Gippsland basins are very close in terms of transport and storage costs (less than 0.2% difference), the cost of transporting to the Darling basin is less sensitive to variations of the cost parameters explored in this study. \n \nThe lowest transport and storage costs found in this study were for the pipeline hub transport cases, more than 35% lower on average than for the single source cases. Regardless of the sensitivity scenario, the hub transport cases were between two-thirds and half of the cost of the shipping case. This highlights the importance of economies of scale in CO2 transport, achieved by employing larger diameter pipelines. This leads to decreases in both the unit capital costs by allowing larger capacities of transport, as well as in operating expenses by decreasing pressure losses along the pipelines, thus requiring less energy for compression. \n \nAlthough the shipping transport option presented the highest cost of the cases considered, there is still a case to be made for ship transport if the project duration is short. As ship transport is less CAPEX intensive (35% of total cost), this mode of transport becomes competitive with pipeline transport if the project duration is decreased, or if the discount rate is increased. Further, shipping also becomes more competitive for longer transport distances. For example, if the hub transport options would take several years to implement, a case could be made for utilising ship transport for a few years while the hub pipeline is constructed, and then transporting via the hub once it is available.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "a7587c96498a247154362bfe35ff30d2b0a047ff", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2991269198", "DOI": "10.1007/s11104-019-04367-5", "CorpusId": 208261095}, "title": "Effects of land use change on turnover and storage of soil organic matter in a tropical forest", "abstract": "Aims Land-use change of tropical forests causes loss of soil organic matter and plant productivity.

Results The Imperata grassland maximizes soil carbon stocks for up to 10\u00a0years due to considerable root litter inputs, but additional organic matter storage is limited over the following 20\u00a0years, due to high grass litter decomposability in the less acidified soil. The conversion of Imperata grassland to oil palm plantation causes greatest loss of soil organic matter, whereas Acacia plantation on Imperata grassland or the Macaranga forest maximizes soil carbon stocks due to input of recalcitrant forest litters and reduced microbial activities in the acidified soils. Conclusion Farmers could adopt short-term (<10\u00a0years) grass fallow or longer-term (>10\u00a0years) fallow under Acacia plantation on Imperata grassland or Macaranga regeneration forest to maximize soil organic matter storage.

By variation of the metal oxide, organic linker, functional group, and framework topology, a series of isoreticular MOFs (IRMOF1, Mg-IRMOF1, Be-IRMOF1, IRMOF1-(NH2)4, IRMOF10, IRMOF13, and IRMOF14) are systematically examined, as well as UMCM-1, a fluorous MOF (F-MOF1), and a covalent-organic framework (COF102). The affinity with CO2 is enhanced by addition of a functional group, and the constricted pore is formed by interpenetration of the framework; both lead to a larger isosteric heat and Henry's constant and subsequently a stronger adsorption at low pressures. The organic linker plays a critical role in tuning the free volume and accessible surface area and largely determines CO2 adsorption at high pressures.

One of the most promising technologies for CO2 capture is based on the adsorption process using solid sorbents. As a member of this family, the metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) are well recognized for their extraordinary surface area, ultrahigh porosity, and most importantly the flexibility to tune the porous structure as well as the surface functionality. For more efficient utilization of MOFs sorbents, several hybrid systems based on MOFs with other solid sorbents have been investigated in order to utilize the synergism between the two sorbents and therefore ultimately improve the overall performance in CO2 separation. Moreover, sorbents such as activated carbons, reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) provide the added feature of high surface area and easily functionalized sites, which contribute to the tuning of the final properties of the composite material. The rGO is an important carbonaceous functional materials that has attracted considerable attention owing to its high aspect ratio, high mechanical strength, unique electrical properties, and chemical stability.

To minimize the undesirable impact of carbon dioxide emissions on the environment, many new technologies are being developed to reduce its emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels. A promising technology is the multi-cyclic Carbonation and Calcination Reaction (CCR) process. The CCR process utilizes a calcium-based sorbent in a high temperature reaction (carbonation) to capture the CO2 from the flue gas stream. The subsequent calcination reaction releases a pure, dry stream of CO2, which can be sequestered. A 20 pph-scale facility firing coal has been constructed at The Ohio State University to demonstrate the CCR process. A number of calcium-based sorbents were tested at this facility. The effect of residence time and Ca/C ratio were evaluated and over 90% CO2 capture was achieved on a once-through basis. One of the calcium based sorbents has exhibited stable reactivity for CO2 capture over multiple cycles. Introduction CO2 is one of the major greenhouse gases contributing to global climate change. In the United States, coal-combustion for electricity generation is responsible for approximately onethird of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions. There are three main approaches to capturing CO2 generated from fossil fuels: precombustion capture system, post-combustion capture system and oxy-combustion [1]. Precombustion capture systems process the primary fuel in a reactor to produce separate streams of CO2 for storage and H2, which is used as a fuel. Post-combustion system separates CO2 from flue gas generated by combustion of fossil fuels. Oxy-combustion uses oxygen instead of air for combustion, producing a flue gas that is mainly H2O and CO2, which is readily captured. Both pre-combustion and oxy-combustion produce a CO2 stream by making significant design changes to a conventional boiler, which is a good strategy for new power plants. For existing electric power plants, post-combustion capture might be the best option. A number of technologies are currently being developed to separate CO2 from coal combustion flue gas. These include sorbents/solvents separation, membrane separation and cryogenic distillation. The calcium based solid sorbents technology has received increasing attention [2-5]. This technology utilizes a calcium-based sorbent in a carbonation reaction at high temperature to capture the CO2 from the flue gas stream and releases a pure, dry stream of CO2 in the subsequent calcination reaction for sequestration. One of the advantages of this technology over low temperature process (such as amine scrubbing) is that the heat released at the temperatures of 600~700 C during the carbonation process is utilized. In this work, a 20 pph-pilot scale facility was constructed to demonstrate the calciumbased carbonation/calcination reactions (CCR) process. The objective of this work includes (1) testing the feasibility of this process; (2) determining CO2 capture capacity of different calcium-based sorbents over multi-cycles; and (3) determining the effect of residence time and calcium/carbon ratios on CO2 removal. Test facility The experiments were conducted in the facility shown in Figure 1. The system consists of a 20lb/hr coal-fired stoker furnace, a rotary calciner, sorbent and ash injection systems, upstream and downstream gas sampling systems, fans, particulate control devices and data acquisition, control systems and associated instrumentation. The sorbent is injected at temperatures between 600-700 C, which is the optimal temperature window for the carbonation reaction. The carbonated sorbent is then separated from flue gas and sent to the rotary calciner for regeneration. The calciner regenerates the spent sorbent for a subsequent CO2 capture cycle. The calciner, which is 20 ft. long and 2 ft in diameter, is electrically-heated. The maximum calciner operating temperature is 980 C.

To safeguard the storage containment, the integrity of all wells needs to be scrutinized.\n Development wells in the identified depleted gas field are more than 40 years old and were not designed with consideration of high CO2 concentration in the reservoir. In consequence, the possibility of well leakage due to accelerated corrosion channeling and cracks, along the wellbore cannot be ignored and require careful evaluation. Rigorous process has been adopted in assessing the feasibility for converting existing gas producers into CO2 injectors. The required defined basis of designs for gas producer and CO2 injection wells differs in a great extent and this governs the re-usability of wells for CO2 injection or necessity to be abandoned. Three (3) new CO2 injectors with fat to slim design approach, corrosion resistant alloy (CRA) material and CO2 resistant cement are designed in view to achieve lifecycle integrity.

In dwarf shrublands dominated by Calluna vulgaris, the aboveground carbon allocation is associated with community age and phase of development. As the Calluna community grows older, a shift to net biomass loss occurs and it was hypothesized this would result in carbon stock increases within the soil.MethodsThe interaction of community age with ecosystem carbon stocks was investigated through a chronosequence study on three Calluna communities, aged 11, 18 and 27\u00a0years.ResultsAboveground Calluna carbon stock increased significantly from the 11\u00a0year community (0.73\u00a0kg C m\u22122) to the 18\u00a0year community (1.11\u00a0kg C m\u22122) but did not significantly change from 18 to 27\u00a0years (1.0\u00a0kg C m\u22122), indicating a net carbon gain that corresponded with the growth phase of the Calluna plants. Moss was also found to be a relatively large contributor to aboveground carbon stock (e.g. 30\u00a0% in the Young community). Moss has often been excluded in aboveground assessments on Calluna heathlands which may have led to previous stock underestimation. Belowground carbon stocks to 25\u00a0cm were six to nine times greater than in the aboveground pools.

CO2 and H2S removal and gas sweetening in remote offshore locations is for the most part non-existent and CO2 is either being released into the atmosphere, within the acceptable operation limit of the platform, or being captured using conventional techniques with physical solvents such as in the selexol, rectisol, or sulfinol processes. Approximately 429.61 kg of CO2 exists in a 42-gallon barrel of distillate fuel oil and a CO2 coefficient of 0.0549 kg exists in 1 cubic foot of gas thereby emphasizing the need for an engineering solution on floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) units [1]. With strict regulation on greenhouse gases, it is increasingly paramount to utilize engineering measures to provide a contingency plan in mitigating carbon footprint with emerging novel technologies. \n \nThe purpose of this study is to retrofit an existing FPSO with a CO2 capture plant; the efficiency of the capture plant, its capture capacity, and energy requirement based on experimental data will be thoroughly investigated during the scale up procedure. \n \nThe research proceedings will require the use of a plethora of simulation suites which include Autodesk Fusion 360 for plant design. Further simulation will be carried out with numerical suites using Mathcad Prime 3.0 to study the scale up procedure from experimental to industrial sized adsorption unit complete with dimensions, energy requirement, capture capacity, and thermal values. \n \nThe FPSO in figure 1 above presented by (Araujo et al., 2016) indicates the availability of a capture plant as part of the process train on an FPSO. Efficiency loss contribution to the system may be deduced but also it is relevant to note the custom nature of the FPSO design being independent in its operation mode compared to other profiles. The availability of the stage compressors, dehydration units, and steam generation plant as part of the FPSO operation aid in minimising the need for additional equipment for the adsorption plant, however investigation has to be made on the redirecting of processes to serve the additional components highlighted above. \n \nPrimary results have shown a low tendency for dual adsorption from the initial kinetic stoichiometric balance which could also be due to the force field parameters and charges affecting the active sites. For the current concept the fixed bed experimental model from the Research and Innovation Centre on CO2 and H2 is scaled up numerically to a fixed bed height of 6.56 feet, and filled with precipitated silica impregnated with PEI solution pressurized with CO2 inflow rated at 13 lb/hr at a fixed 1.2 Bar 60\u00b0C. \n \nThe operational nature of the FPSO will be modified to account for the changes requested in gas sweetening and capture programs or enhanced oil recovery. Results from the simulation will also assist in providing a tangible and relatable understanding to the complexity of solid sorption technology integration within existing processing plants. The findings of this study will help comprehend the viability of an integrated adsorption plant within an existing process train.

The Midwestern Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (MRCSP) is one such Partnership covering 10 states across midwestern and northeast coastal USA. Since its inception in 2003, MRCSP has completed Phase I (2003-2005) involving assessment of regional emission sources and sequestration sinks and Phase II (2005-2011) involving multiple small-scale pilot tests to evaluate the feasibility of CCUS across the region. Under Phase III, which started in 2009, the MRCSP team has focused on detailed evaluation of a large-scale demonstration project of CO2 Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and associated storage. Work has also continued on the assessment of storage potential across the region by the MRCSP team. \n \nThis paper provides the overarching final conclusions of the large-scale test and implications for commercial deployment. The test was conducted in the CO2-EOR fields in northern Michigan, in the Silurian age carbonate reef complex, operated by Core Energy, LLC. The CO2 supply for the EOR is from processing of the natural gas from overlying Antrim Shale formation. The CO2 is pipelined about 16 km to the injection wells and a central processing facility. The overall reef complex consists of more than 800 fields, but EOR started in a single field in the mid-1990s and has currently expanded to ten fields. In 2012, MRCSP started a comprehensive program of characterization, measurement, accounting, modeling, and monitoring to research all aspects relevant to CO2 utilization and storage in the complex with a goal of injecting at least 1 million metric tons of CO2. The reef complex includes fields which have undergone EOR (late-stage life cycle), those undergoing EOR (operational), and those where injection is underway sans production (new fields). This allowed MRCSP to deploy an evolving portfolio of characterization, monitoring, and modeling approaches, which could be customized based on individual field settings (geologic, size, production history, well configurations, and EOR plans) and incorporate lessons learned from initial reefs. The large-scale test and the MRCSP Phase II were concluded in 2020 and an extensive set of final technical and topical reports are available for future researchers and commercial CCUs developers. With the conclusion of the MRCSP Program, Battelle has started a new program to enable and accelerate CCUS deployment, called the Midwest Regional Carbon Initiative (MRCI, midwestccus.org), which covers 20 states across midwestern and northeastern US.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "eac51e0fe2281967f1660e042969517863cfdb6a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2240423079", "CorpusId": 112602805}, "title": "ABSTRACT: An Offshore Carbon Repository in Miocene Strata under Texas State Waters, Gulf of Mexico Basin: Initial Results", "abstract": "As the nation\u2019s leading CO2 emitter from coal-fired utilities (>150 million metric tons, 2006) and a significant user of domestic coal for electricity generation (146 million MWh, 2006), Texas has a strong interest in developing effective CO2 management options.

This eliminates the atmospheric nitrogen from the process, leading to a flue gas consisting mainly of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Further on, the CO2 can be separated for storage purposes. A major drawback of the conventional oxy-fuel combustion technology consists in the high amount of flue gas that has to be recirculated in order to control the temperature level inside the furnace. A novel oxy-fuel firing concept based on a combination of pulverized coal burners operating under non-stoichiometric conditions is investigated as a solution for lowering the necessary flue gas recirculation rate, while keeping the temperature inside the furnace at feasible levels. This paper presents a numerical analysis of the most relevant aspects for this new firing concept, such as process specifics and limitations, burner design criteria, aerodynamic characterization of the near burner zone, flame ignition and temperature. First the process is defined via thermodynamic calculations which are necessary to establish the operating conditions and to generate sets of parameters for the design phase of the burners. Subsequently the parameters generated in the first phase are used as boundary conditions for the design of the burners via CFD simulations. The CFD code used in this study is updated for oxy-firing conditions with the recent developments in terms of gas phase reactions, char conversion modeling and radiative heat transfer in high temperature atmospheres with elevated CO2 concentration. Additionally, the most relevant aspects regarding the validation of the CFD code against in-flame experimental values are presented and discussed.

This study aims to evaluate the spatial patterns and storage of SOC in the shrublands and the relationships of climatic variables and soil pH on the Tibetan Plateau.Materials and methodsWe used 177 profiles of soil samples obtained from 59 shrubland sites on the northeast Tibetan Plateau from 2011 to 2013. Ordinary least squares regressions, curve estimation, and multiple linear regressions were used to evaluate controlling factors on SOC stock. Kriging interpolation was used to upscale sit-level measurements to the whole study area.Results and discussionWe found that SOC storage in the northeast Tibetan shrublands was 1.36\u00a0Pg C in the top 1\u00a0m with an average SOC stock of 12.38\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22122. SOC stock decreased from east to west and south to north but generally increased significantly with the mean annual temperature (MAT) and the mean annual precipitation (MAP), and tended to decrease with soil pH. Although similar relationships were also observed in alpine shrublands, the trends among SOC stock, MAP, and MAT were not observed in desert shrublands. Our results indicate that a reduction in soil pH accelerates the C sequestration potential. Furthermore, global warming contributed to C sequestration in alpine shrublands, specifically, SOC stock increased 8.44\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22122 with an increased unit of MAT in alpine shrublands just considering temperature effects. Meanwhile, the C sequestration was different among different regions due to the uneven increases in precipitation. However, in desert shrublands, MAP and MAT did not significantly affect SOC stock.ConclusionsThe results indicate that though a reduction in soil pH could contribute to C sequestration, MAT and MAP have different effects on SOC stock in different Tibetan Plateau shrublands. Increased MAT and MAP were 0.05\u00a0\u00b0C and 1.67\u00a0mm every year on the Tibetan Plateau, which will increase C sequestration in alpine shrublands, but might have limited impacts on desert shrublands, which help us comprehend soil C cycling in the global climate change scenario.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "43465994b194f6172b643655a082cf26164ef51e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "5569266", "CorpusId": 135397284}, "title": "Pattern formation in multiphase flow through porous media: continuum models and phase diagrams", "abstract": "Carbon capture and geologic storage, dissociation of methane hydrates in permafrost, infiltration of water in soil, and enhanced oil recovery, are some relevant examples of multiphase flow in porous media.

In the first part of this work two OCs, Cu and Mn oxides CuO and Mn2O3, were selected for evaluation using DFT calculations in respect of oxygen uncoupling. Oxygen vacancy formation energies and diffusion barriers both in bulk and at the vicinity of the surface were calculated and tendency of reduction under different conditions was studied using atomistic thermodynamics. It is found that the lowest vacancy formation energy at the surface is always lower than in the corresponding bulk which favors particles having high surface to bulk ratio in terms of reduction. On the other hand, diffusion is not expected to be the rate determining step. Atomistic thermodynamics approach reveals that Mn2O3 is readily reduced into Mn3O4 at relatively low temperatures whereas the reduction of CuO is not straightforward and is likely dependent on additional adsorbed reducing agents, such as fuel molecules. Additionally the effect of applying lateral structural straining to the oxygen diffusion barriers were studied.

The results show that bubbles/droplets under high-pressure conditions reach a steady state faster than low pressure. The measured volumetric mass transfer coefficient increases with the Reynolds number (based on the liquid slug) and is nearly independent of the injection pressure for both the gas and liquid phases. In addition, kLa significantly enlarges with increasing high pressure at the supercritical state. Compared with various chemical engineering applications using millimeter-sized capillaries (with typical kLa measured ranging from \u22480.005 to 0.8 s-1), the microfluidic results show a significant increase in the volumetric mass transfer of CO2 into water by two to three orders of magnitude, O (102-103), with decreasing hydrodynamic diameter (of \u224850 \u03bcm).", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "d38ce6c11c1834a5f0398f70df708e7f9c658510", "externalIds": {"MAG": "76763111", "CorpusId": 107933516}, "title": "Offshore renewable energy powered CO2 injection: a small carbon footprint solution", "abstract": "The work contained herein is the culmination of two months of research and development (R and D).

This fourth volume represents the work of the fourth team, which took the name of team ScarF, an acronym that stands for Small Carbon Footprint designers. The task was to develop a concept design and to propose a solution that would address some of the many challenges associated with CCS. The team comprised a naval architect, an offshore engineer, a hydrodynamicist, a mariner/seafarer and a structural engineer. It was hoped that this would bring a fresh, new and unencumbered perspective to the topic. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has been a field of vigorous R and D for some 30 years now. This book contains a novel concept design proposal that provides a means to effect this carbon storage in an environmentally friendly and safe manner. A high level overview of the concept design can be described thus - the concept entails offshore geological storage of carbon dioxide and the means to effect this storage is powered by marine renewable energy. A holistic approach was adopted by the group in addressing the subject of CCS. Division of labor and sharing of workload among team members made this complex and daunting topic surmountable. This book is intended primarily for those actively involved in research into the field of CCS. The intent is to put forth a compelling case and to provide a progressive outlook that veteran researchers on this topic may not commonly think about. It is equally relevant and readable by legislators, policy makers and anyone with a vested interest in issues pertaining to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions arising from the use of fossil fuels.

While carbon management can be achieved through a number of technological and engineering approaches ranging from energy efficiency (i.e., highly energy integrated system and process intensification) to renewable energy (wind, solar, hydrogen), CO2 capture & storage (CCS) has been identified as having a key role in the energy transition.\n Captured anthropogenic CO2 can be permanently stored in saline aquifers and depleted reservoirs. Saline aquifers (normally unsuitable for industrial or human exploitation) offer the largest storage capacity; however, there is, usually, lack of geological characterization leading to high risks due to large uncertainty. On the other hand, depleted gas fields, close to economical life cessation, are deemed an excellent alternative as safe and long-term storage is already proven and immense geological characterisation has been gathered during production life. Moreover, there is great potential to repurpose the existing offshore infrastructure (pipelines, platforms, and wells) as to minimize capital expenditure and delaying decommissioning costs. Repurposing existing production systems can also be an efficient way to achieve rapid deployment of CCS at large scale.\n In this paper, we present the key engineering challenges, risks, and opportunities in the re-use of existing oil and gas offshore infrastructure for CO2 transport and injection. We highlight the complex operational constraints and interactions between different components of the transportation network.

The range of applications of bacteriophage can be extended by their immobilization on inert surfaces. A novel method for the oriented immobilization of bacteriophage has been developed. The method was based on charge differences between the bacteriophage head, which exhibits an overall net negative charge, and the tail fibers, which possess an overall net positive charge. Hence, the head would be more likely to attach to positively charged surfaces, leaving the tails free to capture and lyse bacteria. Cellulose membranes modified so that they had a positive surface charge were used as the support for phage immobilization. It was established that the number of infective phages immobilized on the positively charged cellulose membranes was significantly higher than that on unmodified membranes. Cocktails of phages active against Listeria or Escherichia coli immobilized on these membranes were shown to effectively control the growth of L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 in ready-to-eat and raw meat, respectively, under different storage temperatures and packaging conditions. The phage storage stability was investigated to further extend their industrial applications. It was shown that lyophilization can be used as a phage-drying method to maintain their infectivity on the newly developed bioactive materials.

Two main approaches for lowering this energy penalty are: (1) Development of low energy requirement CCS technologies and (2) Optimization of the steam cycle to minimize the impact of the energy use on the energy use on the plants power output. Much academic research has been focusing on CO2 capture technologies improvement, however, steam cycle optimization requires expertise from an industrial standpoint. Major modifications are required when conducting process integration between a coal fired power plant and a CCS facility. These changes include extraction of process steam for solvent regeneration and cooling of the flue gas to facilitate CO2 capture process (particularly with heat sensitive amine based CO2 absorption solvents).

The oil and gas upstream sector, accounting for approximately 60% of current world energy needs, faces existential threats to its market share\u2014where inaction and/or insistence on marginal improvisations on past practices do not offer constructive and, ultimately, impactful solutions that the industry is most capable of delivering.\n Central to the issues at hand are questions that demand unambiguous answers: What should be ambitious yet achievable goals for the upstream industry over the short and long term (e.g., by the year 2050) and what specific programs in the spirit of an Apollo project for oil and gas should be envisioned? The often-cited argument that upstream companies are \u201cextractors and not emitters,\u201d and thus its responsibility in climate matters confined only to the extraction process, is shortsighted and dilutes steps that could be taken to maintain the industry\u2019s leading role and capacity in providing the world\u2019s energy supplies.\n Net GHG Emissions\n As a basic premise, it is the net emissions of all greenhouse gases (GHG), not just CO2, that drive climate change. Hence, the upstream industry\u2019s overriding goal should be reduction and eventual elimination of net GHG emissions. Here the key operative words are \u201cnet GHG emissions,\u201d a distinction worth highlighting. This opens up numerous GHG management options, including CO2 capture and storage (CCS), utilization, and removal (CDR) pathways such as afforestation, reforestation, and bio-energy with CCS. This diverse portfolio enhances the ability of both market forces and new technologies to produce evergreen solutions for reducing net GHG emissions.\n Equally flawed as the \u201cupstream are only extractors\u201d notion is the idea that the oil and gas industry should be accepting a carbon-free world energy model fueled 100% by renewable energy sources. While renewables are an important part of the solution in addressing climate change, they are nowhere nearly capable of replacing what oil and gas offers in support of the modern lifestyle. Substantive life-style sacrifices, however, are unlikely at a global scale and so should not constitute the underlying assumption for an ecofriendly energy future. As a further tenet for clean energy, electric vehicles, power grids (currently 85% fueled by fossil and nuclear), and battery manufacturing plants should also be judged on net emission standards.\n There are no silver bullets in the fight against climate change. We need every bullet in our arsenal. Eliminating certain solution pathways, such as nuclear or fossil fuels, just makes a difficult task much more difficult and expensive. By the same token, the prospect of oil and gas playing an active role will only enhance the odds of achieving the ultimate goal\u2014to have a positive, substantive impact on climate\u00a0change.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "e64e2376ca892a8b77b4daf5fe387e0788b0dda2", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.2118/204330-ms", "CorpusId": 244764662}, "title": "Storage of CO2 and Coal Fly Ash using Pickering Foam for Enhanced Oil Recovery", "abstract": "\n CO2 foams have been used for a long time for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and carbon capture, utilization, and storage.

In this study, the geological storage of CO2 and coal fly ash (CFA) using Pickering foam for EOR was explored. The aim is to obtain an inexpensive method for EOR and storage of greenhouse gases and atmospheric pollutants.\n The Pickering foam was prepared using Waring blender method. The experiments were conducted to evaluate CO2/liquid interface enhancement by measuring the interfacial tension and interfacial viscoelastic modulus. As per the heterogeneous sandpack flooding experiments, the profile control capacity and the performance of oil displacement using CO2 foam enhanced by CFA were investigated. The amount of storage from dynamic aspects of CO2 and CFA was measured to demonstrate the storage law.\n The stability of aqueous foam was improved significantly after the addition of CFA. The half-life time of foam stabilized by CFA particles increased by more than about 11 times than that of foam without CFA particles. The interfacial dilatational viscoelastic modulus of CO2/foaming solution increased with CFA particle concentration increasing, indicating the interface transformed from liquid-like to solid-like. Flooding experiments in heterogeneous porous media showed that more produced fluid was displaced from the relatively low-permeability sandpack after the injection of CO2 foam with CFA. The oil recovery by CFA stabilized foam was improved by ~28.3% than that of foam without CFA particles.

Moso bamboo plantations, as a special forest type, are mainly distributed in southern China. There is little information about the carbon storage in moso bamboo plantations, it is now important to better understand the moso bamboo\u2019s carbon sequestration. The main objectives of this study were to investigate the spatial variation of aboveground biomass carbon (AGC) and soil organic carbon (SOC) in moso bamboo plantations and to compare carbon storage in moso bamboo plantations under different management options.Materials and methodsA total of 73 moso bamboo plots were selected in Anji County, which is a famous \u201cbamboo town\u201d in northwest Zhejiang province, China. The diameter at breast height and the age of each moso bamboo in the selected plots were measured in order to calculate the AGC. SOC was analyzed using sulfuric acid\u2013potassium dichromate solution. One-way ANOVA was applied to analyze the significant difference of AGC and SOC under different management options. Geostatistics and geographical information were used to study the spatial dependence characteristics of AGC and SOC.Results and discussionThe AGC values were very variable, ranging from 9.92 to 38.70\u00a0Mg\u2009ha\u22121, with an average of 20.85\u00a0Mg\u2009ha\u22121. The SOC values were from 34.8 to 176.17\u00a0Mg\u2009ha\u22121. Both the AGC and SOC values were followed normal distributions. Moso bamboo plantations contributed about 16.5\u00a0% of total forest biomass carbon in Zhejiang Province, indicating its important influence on regional carbon budget. Geostatistical analysis revealed that the AGC had moderate spatial autocorrelation. A nested model (a spherical model with a Gaussian model) was chosen to describe the variogram. Spatial patterns for AGC were found in Anji County, with relatively high AGC values were found in the southwestern part of Anji County, and low values were located in the eastern and central parts of the county. While no clear spatial autocorrelation trend was observed in the semivariogram of SOC, indicating a random distribution pattern for SOC in the study area. Meanwhile, the Pearson\u2019s correlation between AGC and SOC in bamboo plantation was weak (r\u2009=\u20090.064, p\u2009=\u20090.496), due to moso bamboo\u2019s special growth process and different management options by human beings.ConclusionsIn this study, moderate spatial dependency was found for AGC, while the spatial autocorrelation of SOC was poor.

Current global geologic CO2 storage is about 40 Mt/yr and data from these existing projects do not adequately demonstrate CO2 storage feasibility at the scale of gigatons per year. In this study, we investigate gigaton-scale geologic CO2 storage feasibility using data from thousands of produced water disposal wells in the U.S. To evaluate gigaton-scale geologic CO2 storage feasibility, we investigate three main questions: (i) Is it technically feasible to inject gigatons of CO2 every year in the subsurface? (ii) How many wells are needed to inject a gigaton of CO2? (iii) What is the expected increase in pressure in subsurface when such a large amount of CO2 is injected? For this study, data from produced water disposal wells in the onshore region of the Texas Gulf Coast and Louisiana are analyzed. The data analysis shows that both at the national scale and the Gulf Coast regional scale, it is technically feasible to store gigatons of CO2 per year. Produced water injection wells with injection rates equivalent to 1 MtCO2/yr already exist, and with such rates, relatively few wells are needed to reach the 1 GtCO2 per year goal. Finally, we can expect low pressure buildup even for high-rate injection wells in suitable storage/disposal formations. In summary, this study provides a detailed analysis of produced water data and implications for gigaton-scale CO2 storage.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "fe0ef2657576c95d61107c59010b634b36d85d61", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2979505659", "DOI": "10.3390/c5040062", "CorpusId": 204790119}, "title": "Challenges and Opportunities of Carbon Nanomaterials for Biofuel Cells and Supercapacitors: Personalized Energy for Futuristic Self-Sustainable Devices", "abstract": "Various carbon allotropes are fundamental components in electrochemical energy-conversion and energy-storage devices, e.g., biofuel cells (BFCs) and supercapacitors.

However, all biodevices require a sustainable source of energy, bringing widespread attention to energy research. In this review, we detail the progress in BFCs and supercapacitors attributed to carbon materials. Self-powered biosensors for futuristic biomedical applications are also featured. To develop these energy devices, many challenges needed to be addressed. For this reason, there is a need to: optimize the electron transfer between the enzymatic site and electrode; enhance the power efficiency of the device in fluctuating oxygen conditions; strengthen the efficacy of enzymatic reactions at the carbon-based electrodes; increase the electrochemically accessible surface area of the porous electrode materials; and refine the flexibility of traditional devices by introducing a mechanical resiliency of electrochemical devices to withstand daily multiplexed movements. This article will also feature carbon nanomaterial research alongside opportunities to enhance energy technology and address the challenges facing the field of personalized applications.

Although the ocean within each EEZ has a vast capacity to absorb anthropogenic CO2 and therefore potentially be used as a carbon sink, it is not mentioned within the Kyoto Protocol most likely due to inadequate quantitative estimates. Here, I use two methods to estimate the anthropogenic CO2 storage and uptake for a typically large EEZ (Australia).ResultsDepending on whether the Antarctic territory is included I find that during the 1990s between 30\u201340% of Australia's fossil-fuel CO2 emissions were absorbed by its own EEZ.ConclusionThis example highlights the potential significance of the EEZ carbon sink for national carbon accounts. However, this 'natural anthropogenic CO2 sink' could be used as a disincentive for certain nations to reduce their anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which would ultimately dampen global efforts to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Since the oceanic anthropogenic CO2 sink has limited ability to be controlled by human activities, current and future international climate change policies should have an explicit 'EEZ' clause excluding its use within national carbon accounts.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "549cfeda91734feaf4e5b8a68b361a9a6ca5ac17", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2908870910", "DOI": "10.1007/s11027-018-9832-x", "CorpusId": 158587094}, "title": "Assessing \u201c4 per 1000\u201d soil organic carbon storage rates under Mediterranean climate: a comprehensive data analysis", "abstract": "Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is considered a proxy of soil health, contributing to food production, mitigation, and adaptation to climate change and other ecosystem services.

In this framework, the \u201c4 per 1000\u201d initiative invites partners implementing practical actions to reach a SOC stock annual growth of 4\u2030. For the first time, we assessed the achievement of 4\u2030 objective in Mediterranean agricultural soils, aiming at (i) analyzing a representative data collection assessing edaphoclimatic variables and SOC stocks from field experiments under different managements in arable and woody crops, (ii) providing evidence on SOC storage potential, (iii) identifying the biophysical and management variables associated with SOC storage, and (iv) recommending a set of mitigation strategies for global change.

The transport element could either be by pipeline, ship, or a combination of both, and the choice of transportation strategy will depend on several factors. Such as location of emission source, location of suitable storage sites and the volume of CO2 to be transported. In the ongoing Norwegian Longship project, the transport concept under planning is shipping of CO2 from one or two emission sites to an import hub located at Kollsnes, Norway. From Kollsnes, the CO2 is to be transported to an offshore aquifer through a pipeline. The scope of the ongoing project ''CO2LOS II'' (CO2 Logistics by Ship Phase II) is to reduce the cost of CO2 ship transportation by utilizing new technology and investigate optimization possibilities in the logistic chain. The project focuses on all activities between capture and permanent storage. Within this setting, this article encompasses a qualitative/quantitative assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the transport chain. This associated GHG emission is expected to be significantly lower than the quantities of CO2 stored, still it is worthwhile to estimate. \n \nThe investigation has shown that it is the electricity consumption of the CO2 liquefaction plant that is the major contributor of GHG emissions from the transport chain followed by the fuel consumption of the ship, while the CO2 boil-off from intermediate storage tanks and the ship's cargo tanks is not a major contributor to the emissions in the transport chain. Therefore, the effort should be to reduce the fuel or power consumption or to change the fuel type to a lower carbon intensive fuel or power mix.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "6d66bdc4dafa8694fb61d2d15ff64ac50a8b899e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2902430114", "DOI": "10.4236/jpee.2018.612001", "CorpusId": 134188682}, "title": "CCS Membrane Development at CIUDEN\u2019s Technology Development Centre for CO 2 Capture", "abstract": "CO2 concentration to the atmosphere has risen faster than ever in the last century.
