The results of this work has shown that oxygen enriched air combustion is a viable technique for carbon capture and storage providing CO2 enriched flue gas that will reduce the size of an amine scrubbing plant.

To capture CO2, a blend of a Task Specific Ionic Liquid containing amine moiety mixed with an ionic liquid in polymer form is a potential candidate to replace the existing amine mixture.

The industrial sector accounts for over a fifth of UK primary energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. Energy intensive industry is uniquely restricted in the way it uses energy and emits greenhouse gasses. In this thesis, the potential of radical measures to achieve significant energy demand reduction and emissions abatement in UK energy intensive industry is assessed. Adopted is a multidisciplinary approach combining thermodynamic and techno-economic analysis techniques. Bottom-up assessments are applied to key energy intensive sectors of industry to capture the diverse and interactive array of technological characteristics invisible from a top-down perspective. Detailed projection models are built to design and analyse technology roadmaps for the sectors out to 2050. In an illustrative roadmap assessment, the technological pathways of radical process transition and carbon sequestration were each shown to achieve about 80% abatement in 2050 from 1990 emissions levels. Radical process transition achieved greater abatement before 2030 and this was reflected in lower cumulative emissions over the full period. Higher risk is associated with carbon sequestration from its reliance on timely access to CO2 transport and storage technology to compensate for lower short-medium term abatement. Although, combining carbon sequestration with high levels of biomass combustion indicated the largest potential abatement to 2050. Abatement economics in the iron and steel sector are notably sensitive to resource costs and the carbon trading price. The carbon trading price influences relative production costs in favour of higher abating pathways, but increases absolute costs. This signals the need for supportive policy measures that accelerate technology development and deployment while mitigating the risk of the carbon trading price to competitiveness. Some carbon capture technologies reduce relative production cost even in the absence of a carbon price, but this excludes the cost of CO2 transport and storage. Meanwhile, radical process transition pathways have a higher dependence on the future prices of natural gas, electricity, and scrap. Future work should focus on expanding the economic appraisal to other sectors and to indirect costs, as well as incorporating wider material efficiency strategies and running different future scenarios.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "3b675f3e1e66d1d26578f2b4fa429a6d2a485584", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2787698736", "DOI": "10.4018/IJSESD.2018040102", "CorpusId": 158881759}, "title": "The Awareness and Impact of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) on Climate Change in Malaysia", "abstract": "This article aims to investigate the level of public awareness and perception regarding carbon capture and storage (CCS) and climate change in Malaysia.

Based on the results of 10 advanced energy models, it provides an overview of the results of the scenarios analysed in the CASCADE MINTS project. Three policy approaches are compared in order to address the question how to achieve significant CO2 emission reductions through the application of CCS technologies. The analysis shows that CCS can provide an important contribution to mitigating climate change. Up to 30% of global CO2 emissions could be captured in 2050, while for Europe, due to a more limited growth of the power sector than in some other world regions, this would amount to some 22% of total CO2 emissions. The carbon constraint policies not only induce the large-scale introduction of CCS systems in the electricity sector, but they also accelerate the penetration of renewable energy sources and nuclear. Policies that provide flexibility, for instance through emission trading, are more cost-effective than those obliging CCS to be installed with all new fossil power plants. Therefore, it is recommended to employ mixes of the different CO2 emission reduction options available, also depending on regional circumstances. The uncertainties, particularly in storage capacities, are large. Using conservative estimates in line with the IPCC Special Report, the CASCADE MINTS project arrives at the conclusion that the availability of storage capacity does not impose limits to the amount of CO2 stored in the time frame to 2050.

The global-scale deployment of NETs like Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) can be hampered by climate constraints that are not taken into account by Integrated assessment models (IAMs) used to produce those pathways. Among the various climate constraints, water scarcity appears as a potential bottleneck for future land-based mitigation strategies and remains largely unexplored. Here, we assess climate constraints relative to water scarcity in response to the global deployment of BECCS. To this end, we confront results from an Earth system model (ESM) and an IAM under an array of 25 stringent mitigation pathways. These pathways are compatible with the Paris Agreement long-term temperature goal and with cumulative carbon emissions ranging from 230 Pg C and 300 Pg C from January 1st onwards. We show that all stylized mitigation pathways studied in this work limit warming below 2 \u00b0C or even 1.5 \u00b0C by 2100 but all exhibit a temperature overshoot exceeding 2 \u00b0C after 2050. According to the IAM, a subset of 17 emission pathways are feasible when evaluated in terms of socio-economic and technological constraints. The ESM however shows that water scarcity would limit the deployment of BECCS in all the mitigation pathways assessed in this work. Our findings suggest that the evolution of the water resources under climate change can exert a significant constraint on BECCS deployment before 2050.

Results show that although the CLM could partly capture the seasonal patterns of LAI for temperate grasslands, shortcomings lie in a delayed end date of growing season and a problematic senescence existed in early summer.

To date, the reservoir fluids of principle concern to rock physics community have been hydrocarbon fluids (oils and gasses) and brine. It is now apparent that a better understanding of CO 2 is of paramount importance. CO 2 Properties It is well known that CO 2 is not a simple fluid. Whilst gaseous (~2kg/m 3 ) at surface temperatures and pressures, it exhibits supercritical (sc) behaviour beyond 7.4MPa and 31\u00b0C (464kg/m 3 ) which correspond to approximately 840 m depth at a normal onshore geothermal gradient of 25\u00b0C/km. At that geothermal gradient a liquid phase of CO 2 (680-690 kg/m 3 ) may precede the supercritical phase transition. In the reservoir column, CO 2 could vary in density by almost three orders of magnitude and be in all four fluid states (vapour, gas, liquid and super critical (scCO 2). In addition to this, CO 2 is a non-polar compound and thus has no intermolecular interactions when pure. However, when mixing with polar molecules such as water/brine a quadrupole is induced on the CO 2 molecule [1]. This will affect the behaviour (viscosity, supercritical point etc) of the CO 2 fluid according to the molecules with which it\u2019s interacting.

Transport to the storage site will probably be by pipeline, although part of the transport route could be by ship. Once at the storage site, the CO2 will be injected into a deep underground storage reservoir such as a depleted oil or gas field, or a suitable structure in a saline water-bearing reservoir rock (saline aquifer) via a well or wells.

At present, most of the researches are focusing on decreasing the dependency on fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy.

To solve this problem, three CO2 emission reduction strategies can be used, namely CO2 capture and storage (CCS), CO2 utilisation and CO2 conversion.

The IST method captured the behaviour of the coal-carbon dioxide system for representative ranges of pressure and temperature and generated sorption isotherms for any temperature within the range. For the investigated pressure and temperature range, a good fit was found between the experimental points and the regression curve. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that the equation well captured the behaviour of the coal-CO2 systems studied. The value of limiting absolute sorption was found to be inversely proportional to the mineral matter content. No relationship was established between the petrography of the investigated samples and the sorption (or storage) capacity of the coal.

MOFs have great potential in CCS because they can store greater amounts of CO2 than other classes of porous materials, and their chemically-adjustable organic and inorganic moieties can be carefully pre-designed to be suitable for molecular recognition of CO2. Taking into account the nature of physisorption and inherent polarity of CO2 molecules, addressing materials with both a large surface area and polar pores for strong CO2 binding affinity is an effective method. Decorating the pores of MOFs with some specific functional groups by directly using functionalized organic linkers or postsynthetic modification, that have high binding affinity to CO2 molecules, is among the most promising strategies has been pursued to achieve high-performance CO2 uptake. This review highlights the literature reported on MOFs with amide-decorated pores for CO2 capture, showing the effects of amide groups on uptake capacity, selectivity and adsorption enthalpies of CO2.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "4ac0b3f90fdbee1094231d7240e2dabc309d64fc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1915706793", "DOI": "10.5327/RBG.V38I1.1359", "CorpusId": 129539535}, "title": "Modelo din\u00e2mico de seq\u00fcestro geol\u00f3gico de CO2 em reservat\u00f3rios de petr\u00f3leo", "abstract": "The geologic formations, which can be utilized for CO 2 storage include: deep saline aquifers, oil and gas reservoirs and coal bed reservoirs.

Conversely, using seven diverse integrated assessment models, we project global energy CO2 emissions trajectories on the basis of near-term mitigation efforts and two assumptions on how these efforts continue post-2030. Despite finding a wide range of emissions by 2050, nearly all the scenarios have median warming of less than 3\u2009\u00b0C in 2100. However, the most optimistic scenario is still insufficient to limit global warming to 2\u2009\u00b0C.

First, emissions are more sensitive to the choice of integrated assessment model than to the assumed mitigation effort, highlighting the importance of heterogeneous model intercomparisons. Differences across models reflect diversity in baseline assumptions and impacts of near-term mitigation efforts. Second, the common practice of using economy-wide carbon prices to represent policy exaggerates carbon capture and storage use compared with explicitly modelling policies.

However, the quantification of the environmental impacts of energy and transportation services from novel technologies and biomass production systems are yet to be extensively studied on a case-specific basis. We use a life cycle assessment approach to quantify environmental impacts of four bioenergy systems based on eucalyptus plantations established in abandoned pastureland in Brazil. The alternative bioenergy systems deliver energy and transportation services in Europe (cradle-to-gate analysis), including modern technologies for production of heat, electricity (with and without carbon capture and storage), and advanced liquid biofuels. We find that all bioenergy systems can achieve sizeable climate benefits, but in some cases at increased pressure in other impact categories. The most impacting activities are biomass transport stages, followed by eucalyptus stand establishment, and pellet production. An estimate of the potential large-scale bioenergy deployment of eucalyptus established in marginal areas in Brazil shows that up to 7 EJ of heat, 2.5 EJ of electricity, or 5 EJ of transportation biofuels per year can be delivered. This corresponds to a climate mitigation potential between 0.9% and 2.4% (0.29 and 0.83 GtCO2 per year) of the global anthropogenic emissions in 2015, and between 5.7% and 16% of European emissions, depending on the specific bioenergy system considered.

The mechanism of fracturing under the effect of SC-CO2 jet was explored, and the effects of various influencing factors were analyzed and discussed. The results indicated that higher velocity jets of SC-CO2 not only caused hydraulic-fracturing ring, but also resulted in the increase of stress in the shale rock. It was found that, with the increase of perforation pressure, more cracks initiated at the tip. In contrast, the length of cracks at the root decreased. The length-to-diameter ratio and the aperture ratio distinctly affected the pressurization of SC-CO2 jet, and contributed to the non-linear distribution and various maximum values of the stress in shale rock.

The level of political and industrial support and social protest played a key role in building project legitimacy, while the types of narratives and their credibility determined the distinct trajectories of hydraulic fracturing and carbon capture and storage in France. The conflicts over enhanced oil recovery techniques are also explained through the critical assessment of the governance framework that tends to exclude civil society stakeholders.

Given the intensive nature of agricultural activities in areas where rain-filled wetlands are common, further work is needed to increase our understanding of the effects of these activities on wetland C capture and storage. Key knowledge gaps relating to the effect of management actions on wetland C sequestration include: (a) the benefits of integrated wetland management; (b) the appropriateness of different grazing regimes and the effect of total grazing pressure; (c) the effects of fire; and (d) the extent to which wetland function (C storage) can be restored following agricultural activities, such as cropping.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "2367815c13261fedb3fe3a99fde0a27fca06e63f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "224517895", "DOI": "10.2172/976985", "CorpusId": 56217027}, "title": "A Brief Technical Critique of Ehlig- Economides and Economides 2010: \"Sequestering Carbon Dioxide in a Closed Underground Volume\"", "abstract": "In their 2010 paper, \u201cSequestering Carbon Dioxide in a Close Underground Volume,\u201d authors Ehlig-Economides and Economides assert that \u201cunderground carbon dioxide sequestration via bulk CO2 injection is not feasible at any cost.\u201d The authors base this conclusion on a number of assumptions that the peer reviewed technical literature and decades of carbon dioxide (CO2) injection experience have proven invalid.

The isotope composition of injected CO2 and water are useful tracers for migration and water-rock-gas interactions during such operations. However, quantification of carbon and oxygen equilibrium isotope effects at elevated pressures and temperatures are so far scarce. They thus need more investigations under p/T conditions that are characteristic for reservoirs and overlying aquifers. With this, the main objective of the project was to improve stable carbon and oxygen isotope methods for monitoring CO2 storage sites and their impact of injected CO2 on reservoir geochemistry under controlled laboratory settings. An important finding was that isotope fractionations of carbon between CO2 and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) were not significantly different from each other in experiments with pure CO2 and pressures between 59 and 190 bar. Furthermore, influences of rock types (limestone, dolomite and sandstone) and fluid salinities were found to be negligible for carbon isotope fractionation between CO2 and DIC. Another finding was that water oxygen isotope ratios changed systematically in response to different CO2/H2O molar ratios in closed system equilibration experiments.

Sixty to seventy percent of carbon dioxide emissions originate from fossil fuel power plants. Power companies in the UK, along with oil and gas field operators, are proposing to capture this anthropogenic CO2 and either store it in depleted reservoirs or saline aquifers (carbon capture and storage, CCS), or use it for 'Enhanced Oil Recovery' (EOR) in depleting oil and gas fields. This would involve extensive onshore and offshore pipeline systems. The decline of oil and gas production of reservoirs beyond economic feasibility will require the decommissioning onshore and offshore facilities post-production. This creates a possible opportunity for using existing pipeline infrastructure. Conversions of pipelines from natural gas service to CO2 service for EOR have been done in the United States. However, the differing sources of CO2 and the differing requirements for EOR and CCS play a significant part in allowing the re-use of existing infrastructure. The effect of compositions, the phase of transportation, the original pipeline specifications, and also the pipeline route require major studies prior to allowing re-use. This paper will first review the requirements for specifying the purity of the CO2 for CCS and to highlight the implications that the presence of impurities and the current water specifications for pipelines has on the phase diagram and the associated physical properties of the CO2 stream.

Mineral carbonation presents opportunities for the recycling of steel slags and other alkaline residues that are currently landfilled. The Carbstone process was initially developed to transform non-hydraulic steel slags (stainless steel slag and basic oxygen furnace slags) in high quality construction materials. The process makes use of accelerated mineral carbonation by treating different types of steel slags with CO2 at elevated pressure (up to 2 MPa) and temperatures (20 to 140\u00b0C). For stainless steel slags raising the temperature from 20 to 140\u00b0C had a positive effect on the CO2 uptake, strength development and the environmental properties (i.e. leaching of Cr and Mo) of the carbonated slag compacts. For BOF slags raising the temperature was not beneficial for the carbonation process. Elevated CO2 pressure and CO2 concentration of the feed gas had a positive effect on the CO2 uptake and strength development for both types of steel slags. In addition also the compaction force had a positive effect on the strength development.

An additional advantage is that the carbonated materials sequester 100 to 150 g CO2/kg slag.

However, their use is currently limited because of a prohibitive computational cost and storage requirements. To overcome this problem, an online coarsening algorithm is evaluated in the oceanic component (NEMO\u2010GELATO\u2010PISCES) of CNRM\u2010ESM2\u20101. This algorithm allows to compute biogeochemical processes at a coarse resolution (0.75\u00b0) while inheriting most of the dynamical characteristics of the eddy\u2010admitting OBGCM (0.25\u00b0). Through the coarse\u2010graining process, the effective resolution of the ocean dynamics seen by the biogeochemical model is higher than that which would be obtained from an OBGCM run at 0.75\u00b0.

Momentum is growing in support of carbon capture and storage at the federal level and has been addressed by states neighboring South Dakota. However, carbon capture and storage projects pose a number of unanswered issues, one of the most important of which is subsurface pore space ownership. Property rights are generally functions of state law, and South Dakota has not yet addressed this issue. The uncertainty with how pore space property rights will be recognized in South Dakota impedes the development of carbon capture and storage projects within the state and prevents the creation of a new, valuable use of land. This comment considers surrounding state legislation on pore space ownership and examines existing subsurface case law in South Dakota to support the notion that pore space ownership should rest with the surface estate. I. INTRODUCTION Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a process by which carbon dioxide is \"captured\" before it is released into the atmosphere and pipelined underground for permanent storage in subsurface geologic reservoirs. (1) Climate change is a driving force behind development of carbon capture and storage. (2) Pending climate change legislation creates incentives for CCS by establishing a cap-and-trade system (3) to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. (4) It is possible that the United States could not meet the proposed restrictions on carbon dioxide emissions without using CCS. (5) Furthermore, the Electric Power Research Institute believes that CCS is one of the most significant technologies needed to be commercially deployed to reduce carbon dioxide emission rates to 1990 levels. (6) CCS is a promising technology made increasingly relevant by financial incentives created to reduce carbon dioxide levels. (7) Regional carbon sequestration projects are researching potential locations where geologic storage of carbon dioxide may be appropriate. (8) At least one area of northwestern South Dakota has been specifically noted as being appropriate for such a storage project. (9) Given the momentum building around CCS at the national level, (10) and potential storage located in our state, (11) South Dakota needs to clarify subsurface property rights in order to promote development of projects within the state. (12) The critical issue that specifically needs to be addressed at the state level is the question of ownership of subsurface pore space used for storage of the sequestered carbon dioxide. (13) This question arises when the mineral estate has been severed from the surface estate. (14) Most jurisdictions have not yet determined which interest holder prevails and can therefore grant sequestration rights. (15) With the exception of federal lands, subsurface property rights issues are functions of state law and will therefore be jurisdiction-specific. (16) As CCS projects gain momentum, property rights issues, including ownership of pore space, will be increasingly important concerns. (17) The resolution of this issue also determines who is entitled to compensation in the event of condemnation. (18) For a carbon capture and storage project to be feasible in South Dakota, the question of pore space ownership must be answered. (19) This comment discusses carbon capture and storage generally and the subsurface property rights issue raised in South Dakota in particular. (20) Part II of this comment provides background on climate change and carbon sequestration. (21) Part II also discusses momentum building around CCS through federal legislation and assesses South Dakota's potential role as a storage site for sequestered carbon dioxide. (22) Finally, Part II provides an overview of proposed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulation of geological sequestration. (23) Part III answers the question of pore space ownership in South Dakota by building on basic principles of South Dakota subsurface law and analyses of other jurisdictions' subsurface law. \u2026", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "2de45a224769297e764725ba2075a47b4941bdb4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2884373281", "DOI": "10.1021/ACS.IECR.8B02378", "CorpusId": 105726110}, "title": "Techno-Economic Evaluation of a Small-Scale Power Generation Unit Based on a Chemical Looping Combustion Process in Fixed Bed Reactor Network", "abstract": "This paper reports the techno-economic analysis of a small-scale power generation unit integrating chemical looping combustion (CLC) with inherent CO2 capture and power sections.

Post-combustion process reference is based on the absorption/desorption process with a solution of monoethanolamine (MEA) 30wt% in water. However, this benchmark molecule has some drawbacks and especially the high regeneration energy which is around 4 GJ/ton CO2. For this reason, there is a need to innovate and optimize solvents for CO2 capture in order to minimize the regeneration energy and to improve the solvent capture efficiency. The choice of the promising molecules depends on many physical and chemical characteristics (like absorption capacity, kinetics reaction between amine, reaction enthalpy and solvent stability and toxicity). This work focuses on the absorption capacity and the reaction rates of single and blended amines. Five commercially available amines with 30wt% and 50wt% concentrations in water (monoethanolamine (MEA), diethanolamine (DEA), methyldiethanolamine (MDEA), 2-amino-2-methylpropanol (AMP) and piperazine (PZ)) were screened experimentally based on equilibrium CO2 absorption capacity and CO2 absorption rate data; the results show that experimental data for single amines are in good agreement with literature values. From the solvent combinations, four piperazine-based blends show strong indication of better performance than 30wt% MEA reference. These are: 10wt%-MEA/20wt%-PZ 10wt%-DEA/20wt%-PZ 10wt%-AMP/20wt%-PZ 10wt%-MDEA/20wt%-PZ 10wt%-DEA/20wt%-PZ system shows the highest rate of 1.68mmol/mol-s with 0.88molCO2/molamine capacity while 10wt%-AMP/20wt%-PZ blend recorded the highest CO2 absorption capacity of 0.99molCO2/molamine. 10wt%-DEA/20wt%-PZ and 10wt%-AMP/20wt%-PZ blends are respectively75% and 98% higher than CO2 absorption capacity of 0.50molCO2/molamine for 30wt% MEA. Also, these blends are respectively 54% and 34% higher than CO2 absorption rate of 1.09mmol/mol-s for 30wt% MEA. Equilibrium solubility data for 10wt%-AMP/20wt%-PZ blend is higher twice than the cyclic loading capacity reported for 30wt% MEA reference under CO2 partial pressure of 12kPa. This experimental work showed that solvents with high performance can be obtained through amine blends. This will be of importance towards improving the post-combustion capture technology.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "fbcb13c638a89a6625c4c24014b0b84331d8b7af", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3048778578", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2020.1803039", "CorpusId": 225432288}, "title": "Progressive supply-side policy under the Paris Agreement to enhance geological carbon storage", "abstract": "ABSTRACT As the Paris Agreement moves towards implementation, we explore opportunities it presents to move part of the climate change mitigation challenge upstream into supply-side climate policy. Supply-side climate policies have been sparsely employed to date, although interest is growing in approaches that can curtail and end fossil fuel production. Rather than focussing on fully eliminating fossil fuel production, we set out an alternative supply-side approach that involves fossil fuel producers taking progressive action to reduce and eliminate the climate impacts of their products. Our proposal uses the Paris Agreement\u2019s framework for finance and international cooperation to establish supply-side climate action that supplements demand-side climate policies, and thereby enhance climate ambition. The concepts presented rely on large-scale geosequestration technologies that can deposit carbon into geological reservoirs at rates progressively aligned to those at which carbon is being extracted by fossil fuel producers. Convergence of extraction and deposition rates is a necessary condition for achieving net-zero CO2 emissions while still enabling some essential uses of fossil carbon. We propose an evolutionary approach to policy development, starting as a technology-support mechanism using results-based finance before transitioning into systematic measures under, firstly, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, and, ultimately, decarbonised fuel standards. Collectively these could incentivise fossil fuel resource holders to manage both outflows and inflows of carbon in the geosphere, and in doing so, create, foster, accelerate and maintain an urgently needed market for geological CO2 storage. Key policy insights Balancing rates of carbon extraction from the geosphere (e.g. fossil fuel production) and rates of carbon deposition in stable geological reservoirs can achieve net-zero emissions alongside efforts to reduce emission flows to the atmosphere. Framing the climate mitigation challenge around carbon stock management on the supply-side of fossil fuel markets offers new ways to enhance climate ambition by mobilizing the financial and technical resources of fossil fuel producers in deploying carbon capture and storage. International cooperation under the Paris Agreement offers a powerful opportunity to establish tradeable units that support establishment of a liquid market in verified carbon storage.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "2d861a7f917f838730de61bee04065a903f55199", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2141736497", "DOI": "10.1111/J.1475-4762.2008.00853.X", "CorpusId": 145563716}, "title": "Black gold to green gold: regional energy policy and the rehabilitation of coal in response to climate change", "abstract": "Energy production has come under increasing scrutiny as concerns about energy security and climate change have risen.

Previous studies have sought to explore how renewable energy may develop under multi-level governance, but this paper pays attention to a traditional fossil fuel source, coal, which is still an important means of electricity generation.

All such processes require a net input of energy to drive endothermic reactions, but some are slow and others require extreme operating conditions.

The Svartsengi geothermal power plant operations have pioneered the simultaneous production of electricity and hot water from a geothermal reservoir. The Blue Lagoon is a warm geothermal pool using brine from the power plant. This paper reports on the processes and procedures at the Blue Lagoon and the Svartsengi power station, aimed at increasing sustainability of the geothermal resource by injecting the geothermal brine back to ground, to ensure the geothermal resource sustainability in the area. This paper also discusses and explains in details the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from geothermal plant operations in Iceland. When the steam from a geothermal reservoir emerges from the ground, it comes up with enough energy to drive turbine generators for electricity production. However, this involves releasing several greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, including hydrogen sulphide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2). This research spotlights a geothermal power plant in Hellishei\u00f0i, Iceland, and the use of the CarbFix procedure of capturing and storing carbon dioxide, reducing CO2 emissions from the harnessing of geothermal resources for electricity. CarbFix is a carbon capture and storage (CCS) or carbon mineralization procedure aimed at binding CO2 to rock. This procedure has been used at Hellishei\u00f0i power plant for the past decade in Iceland. Scientists have also developed the SulFix procedure, to capture sulphate H2S in ground. These procedures, SulFix and CarbFix, reduce outlet of greenhouse gases by storing them in basalt rock \u2013 also referred to as mineral carbonation or carbon capture and storage. This involves dissolving the greenhouse gases in water, and re-injecting them back into the ground through boreholes, in Hellishei\u00f0i. This current research also shows the geology in these areas and reports on calculations that have found re-injection of greenhouse gasses to ground to be economically feasible. The paper covers several scenarios that have already been tested to determine the financial feasibility of capture and storage. These have involved calculating the estimated internal rate of return (IRR), the return on investment (ROI) and the present value (NPV). Economic calculations have been made, showing the CarbFix project to be a feasible option contributing to decreased greenhouse gas emissions.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "824f037a51495904588e66fbfebf2a13d094af1e", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 115150724}, "title": "Cryogenic CO 2 Capture as a Cost-Effective CO 2 Capture Process", "abstract": "The cryogenic CO2 capture (CCC) process appears to consume 30% or more less energy and money than other major competing carbon capture processes. The process cools CO2-laden flue gas to desublimation temperatures (-100 to -135 \u00b0C), separates solid CO2 that forms from the flue gas from the light gases, uses the cold products to cool incoming gases in a recuperative heat exchanger, compresses the solid/liquid CO2 to final pressures (100-200 atm), and delivers a compressed CO2 stream separated from an atmospheric pressure light-gas stream. The overall energy and economic costs appear to be at least 30% lower than most competing processes that involve air separation units (ASUs), solvents, or similar technologies. In addition, the CCC process enjoys several ancillary benefits, including (a) it is a minimally invasive bolt-on technology, (b) it provides highly efficient removal of most pollutants (Hg, SOx, NO2, HCl, etc.), (c) possible energy storage capacity, and (d) potential water savings.

However, there is considerable uncertainty that is present in our understanding of the behavior of CO2 that is injected into the sub-surface. In this work, uncertainty analysis is performed using Monte Carlo simulations for capacity estimates and leakage potential for a saline aquifer. Six geologic parameters are treated as uncertain: porosity, irreducible water saturation, the endpoint relative permeability of CO2, residual gas saturation, viscosity of water, and viscosity of the brine. The results of the simulations for capacity indicate that there is a large uncertainty in capacity estimates, and that evaluating the model at using the mean values of the individual parameters does not give the same result as the mean of the distribution of capacity estimates. Sensitivity analysis shows that the two parameters that contribute the most to the uncertainty in estimates are the residual gas saturation and the endpoint relative permeability of CO2. The results for the leakage simulation suggest that while there is a non-zero probability of leakage, the cumulative amount of CO2 that leaks is on the order of fractions of a percent of the total injected volume, suggesting that essentially all the CO2 is trapped. Additionally, the time when leakage begins is on the order of magnitude of thousands of years, indicating that CCS has the potential to be a safe carbon mitigation option. Any development of regulation of geologic storage and relevant policies should take uncertainty into consideration. Better understanding of the uncertainty in the science of geologic storage can influence the areas of further research, and improve the accuracy of models that are being used.
