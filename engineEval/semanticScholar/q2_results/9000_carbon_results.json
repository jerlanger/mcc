The performance of the TES to supply winter heat instead of electrical resistance heat is analysed. Dividing the reactor into a few units (connected in series) for better heat output and storage capacity as developed by the authors is compared to one unit or parallel unit solutions. The heating system components are an exhaust air heat pump, solar collectors and a heat recovery ventilation unit (HRV). The TES is used as heat source during colder periods, which implies improved efficiency and coefficient of performance (COP). Around 70% of electrical resistance heat, assisting an exhaust air heat pump during cold periods, can be substituted with heat from the TES according to the simulation model.

Therefore CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) technologies are seen as an important option for the future operation of coal fired power plants from an environmental but also from an economical point of view. Compared to other CO2 capture technologies (post -combustion and pre-combustion) for coal-fi red power generation, the oxyfuel combustion CO2 capture is not a CO2 selective method [1] but the CO2 is enriched by recirculating the flue gas back to the combustion. Therefore, the main purpose of flue gas cleaning is to control the non-C O2 components for both CO2 capture and the boiler operation, instead of a pretreatment procedure for the selective capture of CO2 from flue or fuel gases. A special focus is thereby on the desulphurization of the flue gas. In order to test the oxyfuel process Vattenfall has constructed an experimental large-scale pilot test facility. For flue gas desulphurization, a wet FGD system designed by Babcock Noell GmbH using the Babcock and Wilcox \u0301s tray absorber technology with three spray levels and an external oxidation tank to avoid in-leakage of oxidation air into the system is used.

CO2-Argon-Steam-Oxy (CARSOXY)-fuel gas turbines are an innovative example that integrates CCS with gas turbine powergen improvement. Replacing air-fuel combustion by CARSOXY combustion has been theoretically proven to increase gas turbine efficiency. Therefore, this paper provides a novel approach to continuously supply a gas turbine with a CARSOXY blend within required molar fractions. The approach involves H2 and N2 production, therefore having the potential of also producing ammonia. Thus, the concept allows CARSOXY cycles to be used to support production of ammonia whilst increasing power efficiency. An ASPEN PLUS model has been developed to demonstrate the approach. The model involves the integrations of an air separation unit (ASU), a steam methane reformer (SMR), water gas shift (WGS) reactors, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) units and heat exchanged gas turbines (HXGT) with a CCS unit. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the ASU-SMR-WGS-PSA-CCS-HXGT model. The results provide a baseline to calibrate the model in order to produce the required CARSOXY molar fraction. A MATLAB code has also been developed to study CO2 compression effects on the CARSOXY gas turbine compressor. Thus, this paper provides a detailed flowsheet of the WGS-PSA-CCS-HXGT model. The paper provides the conditions in which the sensitivity analyses have been conducted to determine the best operable regime for CARSOXY production with other high valuable gases (i.e., hydrogen). Under these specifications, the sensitivity analyses on the (SMR) sub-model spots the H2O mass flow rates, which provides the maximum hydrogen level, the threshold which produces significant CO2 levels. Moreover, splitting the main CH4 supply to sub-supply a SMR reactor and a furnace reactor correlates to best practices for CARSOXY. The sensitivity analysis has also been performed on the (ASU) sub-model to characterise its response with respect to the variation of air flow rate, distillation/boiling rates, product/feed stage locations and the number of stages of the distillation columns. The sensitivity analyses have featured the response of the ASU-SMR-WGS-PSA-CCS-HXGT model.

Nucleation and growth of salt crystals driven by the evaporation of formation water into under-saturated (dry) super-critical CO2 stream results in the changes in the porosity and permeability of the near well-bore area. Permeability reduction is the main reason of the injectivity loss in the context of CO2 storage in saline aquifers. According to recent studies, during CO2 storage, salt crystals form in two different forms: 1) single, large crystals in the aqueous phase, and 2) aggregates of micrometer size salt crystals in the gas phase. All the previous numerical studies at pore-scale addressed the formation of single, large crystals in the aqueous phase.

Change of channel width imposes little effects on the overall heat transfer coefficient, while influences the total heat exchange greatly. MPBE with longer channel length allows smaller overall heat transfer coefficient.

Experimental investigation and modeling of multiphase CO2 pressurized releases.", "abstract": "CO2 handling operations are gaining importance in the worldwide discussion mainly because of the large strategies that are currently being developed to govern the Global Warming. \nIn this sense, the CO2 is considered one of the most important GHG (Greenhouse Gas) since it is also actually emitted in large quantities from anthropogenic sources. These emissions arise mainly from combustion of fossil fuels and biomass in power generation, gasification, industrial processes, natural gas processing, petroleum refining, building and transport sectors. \nThe deployment of the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technique is currently under analysis as a mean of limiting these emissions and so the atmospheric concentration of the CO2. \nThe CCS chain is subdivided into three main systems: the system of capture and compression, the transport system and the storage system. This technology therefore involves the handling of the CO2 to store it in a reservoir, instead of allowing its release to the atmosphere, where it contributes to the Climate Change. \nTherefore, an essential element of the CCS chain is the transportation of large amounts of captured CO2 to the storage site. This is usually achieved by means of large infrastructures mainly consisting of pressurized pipelines that may typically be several hundred kilometers long. \nGiven the significant amounts of CO2 involved and because of this substance at high concentrations is an asphyxiant, the safety of CO2 pipelines is of primarily importance to the public acceptance of CCS as viable means for tackling the impact of the Global Warming. \nThis works moves therefore from the fact that central to QRA (Quantitative Risk Assessment) procedure of pressurized pipeline carrying CO2 is the accurate prediction of the flow parameters concerning an accidental release induced by a rupture. From this point of view, there is naturally the possibility of pipeline rupture that may be driven by many factors like human errors, component failures, corrosion, earthquakes and many others external interferences. \nIn what concerning the CO2 releases modeling, it should be underlined the lack of a comprehensive model able to manage all phenomena that are expected to take place during a rapid depressurization. In the case of CO2 pipeline, the model must be capable of handling multiphase flows also at sonic conditions as well as the peculiar thermodynamic behavior that may invoke the occurrence of the solid phase. \nThe main target is to have a comprehensive, reliable and easy applicable (from a QRA perspective) model to be used in assessing hazard profiles related to a CO2 pipeline rapid depressurization. \nIn this sense, available models lack the whole dynamics and the formation and sublimation of solid CO2 expect for sophisticated and detailed CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamic) simulation that are substantially inappropriate to face the emergencies and the investigation of general scenarios. \nThe model availability is also still limited by the lack of experimental data that are used to drive the model formulation and its validation. The few accessible experimental series give contradictory results in what concerning the peculiar CO2 behavior under transient pressure fields and in correspondence of choked flow conditions thus requiring further investigations. \nMoving from these considerations, the present study has the aim of covering the existing gaps in what concerning the availability of a descriptive model. \nThe study is introduced by a detailed theoretical investigation of specific phenomena the CO2 undergoes when subjected to a rapid depressurization. Examples of these may include the occurrence of multiple choked flow states depending on the established thermodynamic equilibrium (liquid-vapor, solid-vapor) and the investigation of specific thermodynamic pathways that are linked to the solid phase appearance. \nA section pertaining to the experimental campaign follows. In this sense the data availability is enhanced by the collection of self-made data series especially linked to moderate pressures (up to 65-70 barg). The experimental arrangement allows for the investigation of different charging states, matching the operative CO2 conditions. Collected data are then used to support the model development in the assessment of specific discharge and thermodynamic parameters that are needed to close the mathematical structure. \nThe proposed model, that is the main target of this investigation, is illustrated and discussed in a specific section with details on the adopted assumptions, the mathematical structure and the numerical approach. The structure covers all main mechanisms related to the rapid CO2 depressurization including phase change mechanisms (boiling, solidification and sublimation), heat transfer and friction effects as well as a reliable thermodynamic description of the expansion pathway to atmospheric conditions. \nResults are first checked against the collected laboratory scale experimental data especially in what concerning the prediction of the main depressurization variables requested by the QRA procedure (stagnation and orifice pressure and temperature profiles, mass flow rate evolution, total discharge time). \nA model extension oriented to large scale geometries and different orifice sizes and operative conditions is then proposed. Main discharge parameters are analyzed and their sensitivity to variations in the domain and orifice sizes is assessed with specific light on the relative amounts of dense phase produced and the total discharge time. \nThe mathematical model is then supplemented of some features concerning non-equilibrium phenomena that do not allow for a mere thermodynamic description. Among these the behavior in the spinodal region, the structural entropy increase in the passage across the triple point and the irreversibilities in the phase change mechanisms are investigated. The target is to firstly check if the additional complication is reasonable from the QRA perspective to then move to variations in the release parameters that emerge because of this extended approach. \nA final section is dedicated to the model application to some real existing CCS and EOR (Ehnanced Oil Recovery) projects worldwide making available the main discharge parameters and profiles for different pipeline lengths and orifice sizes. A specific investigation on the solid CO2 is performed in addition to the collection of useful comprehensive parameters to be used in QRA studies.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "6380f3d8459949b5bf5edcccf3591999745d3d81", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2912998989", "DOI": "10.5772/INTECHOPEN.78339", "CorpusId": 139510656}, "title": "Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis as a Promising Technology for Hydrogen Production and Energy Storage", "abstract": "Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis is industrially important as a green source of high-purity hydrogen, for chemical applications as well as energy storage.

Compared to light oil, heavy oils have a much larger carbon footprint and hence, from environmental point of view, are more attractive targets for CCS. Heavy oil reservoirs are usually produced by thermal recovery techniques which only exacerbates adverse environmental effects of oil production from these reservoirs. Heavy oil reservoirs can therefore be good candidates for combining CCS and EOR. Examples of such reservoirs are found on North Slope, Alaska, where huge heavy oil resources exist in shallow reservoirs at exceptionally low reservoir temperature because of permafrost. This paper presents the results of a series of coreflood studies using a heavy crude sample from a permafrost region. The experiments compare CO2 storage capacity of the rock sample at reservoir conditions under different injection strategies and determine the additional recovery as a result of CO2 injection. The results show that CO2 injection doubled the heavy oil recovery by plain waterflood however the storage capacity of the rock was not significantly affected by the injection strategy.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a99f72e7eeb245f6b27ca5f67543b519a1d362af", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2983982686", "CorpusId": 210280527}, "title": "Synthesis, Characterization and Modificationof Metal Organic Framework-235 forCarbon Dioxide Adsorption", "abstract": "Reducing anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emission and lowering the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has quickly become one of the most urgent environmental issues in this era.

Though routes to decarbonizing fossil fuel use, such as carbon capture and storage, have been proposed and have been demonstrated at commercial scale, current CCS CO2 storage quantities are very small and no large-scale practical route to providing fossil fuel energy, without the CO2 emissions attendant with fuel production and use has been proposed.

Nitrogen addition might have stimulated both emissions and consumption of CH4 but the sink or source strength depended highly on soil water content. We concluded that the application of mineral-N and manure input may play an important role with reference to global warming provided the season can support substantial crop productivity that may reduce the amount of N2O loss per unit yield.

The conduit system acts as a mixing chamber where the injected materials are sorted and rearranged. Information on the sediments and their transport processes can be obtained by investigating the source areas, by inspection of cave sediments, and by monitoring clastic sediment discharged from springs as a function of flow conditions. The engine that drives the sediment transport system is storm recharge in the ground water basin drained by the conduit system. Fine-grained clastics move during ordinary storms and can be captured easily at springs, but movement of coarser materials requires high-intensity, therefore infrequent, storms so that most of the sediment flux is episodic with long periods of storage interspersed with short periods of movement.

In contrast to current carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies which require external input energy or mass to extract and store the waste without efficient utilization, this study proposes a thermally regenerative CO2-induced pH-gradient cell (TRCPC) that simultaneously utilizes CO2 and low-grade heat for waste-to-electricity conversion. CO2 is absorbed in one side of the symmetric electrolyte and causes a change in pH of the cell to induce voltage generation, achieving a peak power density of 0.578 Wm\u22122. After discharging, the system can be regenerated using low-grade heat while the CO2 can then be stored and transported. This research proposes a promising method with economic and environmental benefits that converts CO2 and waste heat into electricity before further CO2 storage. The massive increase in waste CO2 has aroused widespread social concern because of its intense impacts on the global environment and climate. Incessant combustion of carbon-based fuels, as the primary energy sources, produce relentless CO2 and ubiquitous waste heat; a majority of this waste heat is regarded as low-grade heat (<100 \u00b0C) and is usually dumped to the environment without use. To reduce the CO2 level and alleviate the global warming issue, numerous research efforts have been made to develop carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies with the use of thermal energy and nucleophile absorbents. For example, monoethanolamine can be employed to absorb CO2, and heat is then used to separate monoethanolamine and CO2. 9 However, the operating temperature of that process is usually above 200 \u00b0C, which inevitably increases the energy penalty cost. Recently, electrochemical systems have also received a great deal of attention, but external electricity is usually needed in the regeneration process. Evidently the previous studies mainly focused on the use of extra energy (e.g., heat or electricity) to purify and store CO2. A few exceptions, such as molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFCs) and solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs), enable electricity generation during the CCS process, but they consume external fuel supply. The relatively high working temperature, inflexible assembly, and expensive electrode catalyst material further inhibit their wide-scale implementation. Therefore, it is paramount to construct a flexible, cost-effective, and scalable system that utilizes waste (CO2 and low-grade heat) in CCS to produce electricity without an external energy supply. However, previous attempts at this strategy are still in their infancy and suffer short discharge time or low power density. Herein, a new low-grade thermally regenerative CO2induced pH-gradient cell (TRCPC) is proposed to recycle waste CO2 and thereby produce durable electricity. It was designed by using pH-sensitive electrodes in a carbonate-based absorbent, which has unique advantages, including low cost and nontoxicity, and can be regenerated by using low-grade heat to allow system cyclability. The TRCPC achieved a satisfying peak power density of 0.578 Wm\u22122 with a long discharge time, which is over 10 times longer than that reported in previous contributions. The structure and working mechanism of TRCPC are presented in panels a and b of Figure 1, respectively. A symmetric cell with two MnO2/MnOOH electrodes is initially filled with 0.5 M sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) for both anolyte and catholyte.

Water shortage and low nitrogen reduce canopy growth and dry matter production, which is compensated in part by an increase in the fraction of assimilates partitioned to storage. Conversely, high nitrogen and ample water encourage growth of the canopy, increase assimilation of carbon dioxide but reduce the proportion of assimilates stored as sugar. This paper sets out to examine simple relationships between sugar yield, total dry matter and soil nitrogen in rain-fed and irrigated sugar beet crops (Beta vulgaris L.) from 46 field experiments spanning 12 years and a range of soil types, in order to improve prediction of sugar yields.Two partitioning functions were fitted to the data. The first represents a useful alternative formulation of the allometric growth function that overcomes some of the difficulties in the interpretation of the parameters. This model adequately described the seasonal progress of sugar yield (Y) in relation to total dry matter (W), but it was difficult to postulate biological mechanisms as to how the parameters should vary in relation to varying soil nitrogen or to drought. The second partitioning function, given by Y = W \u2212 (1/k) log(1 + kW), also described the data well, but had the more useful parameter, k, the decay rate of the fraction of assimilates partitioned to structural matter. This was shown to be greater in crops which had experienced significant drought and was inversely proportional to the amount of nitrogen taken up by the crops. Relationships between k and amounts of nitrogen fertilizer applied and/or amounts of residual nitrogen in the soil at sowing, however, were more variable. These could be improved by additionally taking account of soil type and rainfall following nitrogen fertilizer application in late spring. The models are a useful extension to yield forecasting models because they provide a simple means of estimating sugar yield from total dry matter in relation to factors that affect partitioning of assimilates such as drought and soil nitrogen availability.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "8c254a6a0328011a8bf33509570294f339d4f69a", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "5002052", "MAG": "2512317680", "DOI": "10.1186/s13021-016-0060-y", "CorpusId": 18922603, "PubMed": "27635152"}, "title": "Comparison of national level biomass maps for conterminous US: understanding pattern and causes of differences", "abstract": "BackgroundAs Earth observation satellite data proliferate, so too do maps derived from them.

All the maps did well in the dominant forest type with maximum agreement between them. The comparison of difference between maps S and K with regional maps suggests that these maps were able to capture the disturbance and not so much regrowth pattern.ConclusionsThe study provides a comprehensive systematic approach to compare and evaluate different real data products using examples of four AGB maps. Although ostensibly the four maps map the same variable, they have different spatial distribution at different scale. Except the 2003 map, one can use other maps at the coarser spatial resolution.

Data on the extent of forests compiled from various sources were used in the calculations. Productivities were simulated using species-specific growth and yield simulators for the main trees species planted in the country. Biomass expansion factors, root-to-shoot ratios, wood densities, and carbon fractions compiled from literature were applied. C stocks in necromass (deadwood and litter) and harvested wood products (HWP) were also included in the calculations.ResultsPlantation forests stocked 231 Mt C in 1990 increasing to 612 Mt C in 2016 due to an increase in plantation area and higher productivity of the stands during the 26-year period. Eucalyptus contributed 58% of the C stock in 1990 and 71% in 2016 due to a remarkable increase in plantation area and productivity. Pinus reduced its proportion of the carbon storage due to its low growth in area, while the other species shared less than 6% of the C stocks during the period of study. Aboveground biomass, belowground biomass and necromass shared 71, 12, and 5% of the total C stocked in plantations in 2016, respectively. HWP stocked 76 Mt C in the period, which represents 12% of the total C stocked. Carbon dioxide removals by Brazilian forest plantations during the 26-year period totaled 1669 Gt CO2-e.ConclusionsThe carbon dioxide removed by Brazilian forest plantations over the 26\u00a0years represent almost the totality of the country\u00b4s emissions from the waste sector within the same period, or from the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector in 2016.

It is generally assumed that the rise in CO2 levels in the atmosphere is the main culprit, although several other greenhouse gases (GHG) also play a role. Next to limitation of CO2 emissions by higher efficiency, developing alternative energy sources or changing our wasteful style of living, there are two general approaches to combat climate change.

Among methods to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, the best known are CCS (carbon capture and storage) and \u2018geological storage\u2019, which has nothing to do with geology, except for the receptacle being of natural origin [4]. There are two processes by which CO2 has been removed from the atmosphere throughout geological time, primarily by weathering reactions of Ca- and Mg-silicates, and to a lesser extent by storage of organic carbon in coal beds, oil and natural gas, and carbonates. Thus, enhanced weathering is a logical step to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. To that purpose, abundant rock types available in large volumes are ground to increase reactivity, possibly mix with pyrolized wood known as \u2018biochar\u2019 (Brazil: \u2018terra preta\u2019), and spread the mix in climate zones that favor rapid weathering, ie. the wet tropics.

The objective of this research was to eliminate an enrichment step to allow detection of bacteria directly in food and water samples in 30 min. A high-flow-rate, fluidized bed to capture and concentrate large (bacteria and spores) and small (protein) molecules was developed. This format, ImmunoFlow, is volume independent and uses large beads (greater than 3 mm in diameter) when capturing bacteria to prevent sample clogging when testing food samples. Detection of bound targets was done using existing enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) protocols. Four antibodies (anti-Escherichia coli O157:H7, -Bacillus globigii, -bovine serum albumin [BSA], and -ovalbumin [OVA]) were covalently coupled to various glass and ceramic beads. Very small amounts of BSA (<1 ng) and OVA (0.2 to 4.0 \u03bcg) were detected. Various industrial and environmental samples were used to observe the effect of the sample composition on the capture of anti-B. globigii and anti-E. coli O157:H7 modified beads. The lower limit of detection for both E. coli O157:H7 andB. globigii was 1 spore/cell independent of the sample size. The activity of anti-B. globigii modified beads declined after 3 days. Anti-E. coli O157:H7 modified beads declined in their capture ability after 2 days in various storage buffers. Storage temperature (4 and 25\u00b0C) did not influence the stability.

Capture and storage or utilization are required to mitigate adverse environmental effects. Aqueous amine-based CO2 capture solvents are currently considered the industry standard, but deployment to market is limited by their high regeneration energy. In that context, water -lean solvent systems such as CO2 binding organic liquids (CO2BOLs) are being developed to reduce this energy requirement for CO 2 capture. Many water-lean solvents such as CO2BOLs are currently limited by the high viscosities of concentrated electrolyte solvents, thus many of these solvents have yet to move towards commercialization. Historically, viscosity reduction has been achieved by systematic methods such as introduction of steric hindrance on the anion to minimize the intermolecular cation-anion interactions, fine-tuning the electronics, hydrogen bonding orientation and strength, and charge solvation. Conventional standard t rial-and-error approaches, while effective, are time consuming and economically expensive. We rethink the metrics and design principles of low-viscosity CO2 capture solvents using a combined synthesis and computational modeling approach. We critically study the effects of viscosity reducing factors such as orientation of hydrogen bonding, introduction of higher degrees of freedom, and cation or anion charge solvation, and assess whether or how each factor affects viscosity of CO2BOL CO2 capture solvents. Ultimately, we found that hydrogen bond orientation and strength is the predominant factor influencing the viscosity in CO 2BOL solvents. With this knowledge, a new CO2BOL variant, 1-MEIPADM-2-BOL, was synthesized and tested, resulting in a solvent that is approximately 60% less viscous at 25 mol% CO2 loading than our base compound 1-IPADM-2-BOL.

The transport of timber from the forest to primary milling facilities may in particular create emissions that reduce the net sequestration value of product carbon storage. However, attempts to quantify the effects of transport on the net effects of forest management typically use relatively sparse survey data to determine transportation emission factors. We developed an approach for systematically determining transport emissions using: 1) -remotely sensed maps to estimate the spatial distribution of harvests, and 2) - industry data to determine landscape-level harvest volumes as well as the location and processing totals of individual mills. These data support spatial network analysis that can produce estimates of fossil carbon released in timber transport.ResultsTransport-related emissions, evaluated as a fraction of transported wood carbon at 4 points in time on a landscape in western Montana (USA), rose from 0.5% in 1988 to 1.7% in 2004 as local mills closed and spatial patterns of harvest shifted due to decreased logging on federal lands.ConclusionThe apparent sensitivity of transport emissions to harvest and infrastructure patterns suggests that timber haul is a dynamic component of forest carbon management that bears further study both across regions and over time.

Experimental and natural field\u2010based studies have come up with nonconsistent patterns of biodiversity\u2013ecosystem function, supporting either niche complementarity or selection effects hypothesis. Here, we used aboveground carbon (AGC) storage as proxy for ecosystem function in a South African mistbelt forest, and analyzed its relationship with species diversity, through functional diversity and functional dominance. We hypothesized that (1) diversity influences AGC through functional diversity and functional dominance effects; and (2) effects of diversity on AGC would be greater for functional dominance than for functional diversity. Community weight mean (CWM) of functional traits (wood density, specific leaf area, and maximum plant height) were calculated to assess functional dominance (selection effects). As for functional diversity (complementarity effects), multitrait functional diversity indices were computed. The first hypothesis was tested using structural equation modeling. For the second hypothesis, effects of environmental variables such as slope and altitude were tested first, and separate linear mixed\u2010effects models were fitted afterward for functional diversity, functional dominance, and both. Results showed that AGC varied significantly along the slope gradient, with lower values at steeper sites. Species diversity (richness) had positive relationship with AGC, even when slope effects were considered. As predicted, diversity effects on AGC were mediated through functional diversity and functional dominance, suggesting that both the niche complementarity and the selection effects are not exclusively affecting carbon storage. However, the effects were greater for functional diversity than for functional dominance. Furthermore, functional dominance effects were strongly transmitted by CWM of maximum plant height, reflecting the importance of forest vertical stratification for diversity\u2013carbon relationship. We therefore argue for stronger complementary effects that would be induced also by complementary light\u2010use efficiency of tree and species growing in the understory layer.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "37cc8e3ced2f76e7c07f95c258c5931d8c5024eb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2027148022", "DOI": "10.1021/la101377u", "CorpusId": 22610922, "PubMed": "20527946"}, "title": "Characteristics of hydrogen storage by spillover on Pt-doped carbon and catalyst-bridged metal organic framework.", "abstract": "Metal dispersion is a crucially important factor for hydrogen spillover storage on metal/carbon materials. For Pt on carbon (Pt/C), dispersion into nearly 2 nm clusters or nanoparticles is necessary to facilitate spillover. On an effective Pt/C spillover sorbent, temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) results reveal the highest hydrogen signal is from the high-energy Pt edges, steps or (110) surfaces, even though the (111) faces are more abundant. Previous theoretical studies showed the high-energy sites (including the 110 face) are by far the most preferred for effective splitting of hydrogen. These are in significantly smaller fractions for larger particles, and thus the larger particles are less efficient. In addition, the rate-limiting step for spillover on effective Pt/C is identified by the susceptibility to isotopic differences, first-order behavior and isolation from catalyzed H(2)/HD/D(2) equilibrium measurements; we conclude it is the spillover step or surface diffusion. We extended our analysis to a review of our previous work, spillover on metal organic frameworks (MOFs). This has been achieved by bridging a commercial H(2) dissociation catalyst (Pt/C) to MOFs, large enhancement factors (up to 8) were observed. Unlike Pt/C sorbents, sample-to-sample consistency in storage capacity on the bridged MOF samples is difficult to achieve. Inconsistency in the enhancements by spillover is shown; however, significant enhancement factors are still observed when samples are prepared and activated properly.

Selecting appropriate equations from a fitted model is a process which can involves several\n criteria, some widely used and others used to a lesser extent. This study analyzes six selection criteria for models fitted to six sets of individual biomass collected from woody indigenous species of the Tropical Atlantic Rain Forest in Brazil. Six models were examined and the respective fitted equations evaluated by the residual sum of squares, adjusted coefficient of determination, absolute and relative estimates of the standard error of estimate, and Akaike and Schwartz (Bayesian) information criteria. The aim of this study was to analyze the numeric behavior of these model selection criteria and discuss the ease of interpretation of them. The importance of residual analysis in model selection is stressed.ResultsThe adjusted coefficient of determination ($$ R^{2}_{adj.} $$Radj.2) and the standard error of estimate in percentage (Syx%) are relative model selection criteria and are not affected by sample size and scale of the response variable. The sum of squared residuals (SSR), the absolute standard error of estimate (Syx), the Akaike information criterion and the Schwartz information criterion, in turn, depend on these quantities. The best fit model was always the same within a given data set regardless the model selection criteria considered (except for SSR in two cases), indicating they tend to converge to a common result. However, such criteria are not always closely related across different data sets. General model selection criteria are indicative of the average goodness of fit, but do not capture bias and outlier effects. Graphical residual analysis is a useful tool to this detection and must always be used in model selection.ConclusionsIt is concluded that the criteria for model selection tend to lead to a common result, regardless their mathematical formulation and statistical significance.

Therefore, we assessed the importance of land use on soil carbon stocks by measuring various C fractions and root biomass (0\u20136 m) in slash-and-burn systems and (semi-) permanent cultures. An extensive root system down to at least 6 m depth was present under various secondary vegetation stands and slashed and burned fields recently taken into cultivation as well as under a primary forest. Shallower rooting patterns were evident under (permanent) oil palm (4.5 m) and (semi-permanent) passion fruit plantations (2.5 m). Carbon storage in soils of traditional slash-and-burn agriculture up to 6 m depth (185 t ha-1) was not significantly lower than under a primary forest (196 t ha-1) but declined significantly under (semi-) permanent cultures (to 146\u2013167 t ha-1). Compared to above-ground C losses, soil C losses due to slash-and-burn agriculture may thus be small.

CCS has the potential to make a critical contribution to reducing the amount of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere as the most effective, safe, and low-cost long-term CO2 storage technology.One of the key requirements in CCS is long-term zonal isolation. Subsurface pressure and temperature changes can compromise the stability and integrity of the cement sheath around a CO2 injection well. Compromising well integrity can quickly lead to CO2 leakage at the surface, putting containment at risk. That's why the cement sheath used in the wellbore must be exceptionally durable and able to maintain its integrity for hundreds of years.Portland cement has been used successfully for decades in oil and gas well cementing.

The Technology Development Centre for CO2 Capture comprises two different technologies on oxycombustion: Pulverized Coal (PC) and Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB). This paper will focus on the design and main characteristics of the 30 MWth oxy-CFB boiler. Foster Wheeler is the technology provider of the Flexi-Burn\u00ae CFB unit, for which commissioning is planned in July 2011. The CFB unit design allows either the operation under conventional combustion with air or under oxycombustion conditions (Flexi-Burn\u00ae concept). The size of this experimental boiler is sufficient to allow the scaling of the results to commercial units, while maintaining relatively low initial investment and operating expenses. In this way, multiple fuels and operating conditions can be tested economically in this experimental unit. The design of the CFB boiler considers the particular requirements of a testing unit, including a wide range of measurement points and the option to vary the operating conditions with the maximum flexibility and versatility possible, to meet the necessary requirements and boundary conditions. By the same token, the ease of maintenance and inspection of all unit components have been maximized as well as increasing the instrumentation to gather additional data from future operation. The paper includes the description of the facility and the testing program of CIUDEN Technology Development Centre for CO2 Capture in Northwestern Spain, in particular the 30 MWth oxy-CFB system. The configuration combines CFB\u2019s intrinsic advantages (fuel flexibility and low SOx and NOx emissions) with oxygen-firing for carbon capture and storage (CCS). It must be pointed out that the CFB technology appears to be ideally well suited to oxygen-firing combustion. This installation, which is the first of its class, will provide a real basis for the design and operation of flexible and competitive oxycombustion facilities at the demonstration scale, thus accelerating the deployment of CCS technologies. This will allow results to be scaled up, and applied to a 300 MWe oxyCFB supercritical oxycombustion Power Station (OXYCFB300 Compostilla Project) in order to validate CCS technology at a utility scale.

In a northern hardwood forest ecosystem, experimental N deposition has decreased the extent of forest floor decay, leading to increased soil C storage. To better understand the microbial mechanisms mediating this response, we examined the functional genes derived from communities of actinobacteria and fungi present in the forest floor using GeoChip 4.0, a high-throughput functional-gene microarray. The compositions of functional genes derived from actinobacterial and fungal communities was significantly altered by experimental nitrogen deposition, with more heterogeneity detected in both groups. Experimental N deposition significantly decreased the richness and diversity of genes involved in the depolymerization of starch (\u223c12%), hemicellulose (\u223c16%), cellulose (\u223c16%), chitin (\u223c15%), and lignin (\u223c16%). The decrease in richness occurred across all taxonomic groupings detected by the microarray. The compositions of genes encoding oxidoreductases, which plausibly mediate lignin decay, were responsible for much of the observed dissimilarity between actinobacterial communities under ambient and experimental N deposition. This shift in composition and decrease in richness and diversity of genes encoding enzymes that mediate the decay process has occurred in parallel with a reduction in the extent of decay and accumulation of soil organic matter. Our observations indicate that compositional changes in actinobacterial and fungal communities elicited by experimental N deposition have functional implications for the cycling and storage of carbon in forest ecosystems.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "5f1afa823eae7fb388ed457b9d0bc45a031d87a2", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fphy.2022.870205", "CorpusId": 247942205}, "title": "Superalkalis for the Activation of Carbon Dioxide: A Review", "abstract": "The activation of carbon dioxide is essential not only for global carbon balance but also for its conversion into fuel.

Carbon capture technologies can be applied at the pre-combustion, oxy-fuel combustion, and post-combustion stages, the latter being the most widely used due to its flexibility. Among the several CO2 separation processes available for carbon capture, absorption is the most widely used where amine solutions are used as absorbents. This paper highlights the use of a wetted wall column fabricated by Siy and Villanueva (2012) and simulated flue gas to determine the performance of CO2 absorption in terms of the percentage of CO2 absorbed, the steady state time, and the overall gas mass transfer coefficient. The concentrations used were 1, 5, 10, and 15% NH3(aq) at a constant temperature range of 12-17oC, solvent flow rate of 100 mL/min, and simulated flue gas flow rate of 2 L/min. It was found that increasing the solvent concentration resulted in a proportional increase both in the percentage of CO2 absorbed and the overall gas mass transfer coefficient. The average percentage of CO2 absorbed ranged within 52.25% to 95.29% while the overall mass transfer coefficient ranged from 0.1843 to 0.7746 mmol/m2\u2219s\u2219kPa.

The present study represents a part of a series of system evaluations being carried out at NETL to aid in prioritizing technological advances along research pathways to the realization of utility-scale SOFC systems, a transformational goal of the fuel cell program. In particular, the system performance of utility-scale NG fuel cell (NGFC) systems with and without carbon dioxide (CO2) capture is presented. The NGFC system analyzed features an external auto-thermal reformer (ATR) feeding the fuel to the SOFC system consisting of planar anode-supported SOFC with separated anode and cathode off-gas streams. In systems with CO2 capture, an air separation unit (ASU) is used to provide the oxygen for the ATR and for the combustion of unutilized fuel in the SOFC anode exhaust along with a CO2 purification unit to provide a nearly pure CO2 stream suitable for transport for usage in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations or for storage in underground saline formations. Remaining thermal energy in the exhaust gases is recovered in a bottoming steam Rankine cycle while supplying any process heat requirements. A reduced order model (ROM) developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is used to predict the SOFC performance. The ROM, while being computationally effective for system studies, provides other detailed information about the state of the stack, such as the internal temperature gradient, generally not available from simple performance models often used to represent the SOFC. Such additional information can be important in system optimization studies to preclude operation under off-design conditions that can adversely impact overall system reliability.

The effects of commonly used manure treatments on the persistence of these pathogens have rarely been compared. The objective of this study was to compare the persistence of artificially inoculated M. paratuberculosis, as well as other naturally occurring pathogens, during the treatment of dairy manure under conditions that simulate three commonly used manure management methods: thermophilic composting at 55\u00b0C, manure packing at 25\u00b0C (or low-temperature composting), and liquid lagoon storage. Straw and sawdust amendments used for composting and packing were also compared. Manure was obtained from a large Ohio free-stall dairy herd and was inoculated with M. paratuberculosis at 106 CFU/g in the final mixes. For compost and pack treatments, this manure was amended with sawdust or straw to provide an optimal moisture content (60%) for composting for 56 days. To simulate liquid storage, water was added to the manure (to simulate liquid flushing and storage) and the slurry was placed in triplicate covered 4-liter Erlenmeyer flasks, incubated under ambient conditions for 175 days. The treatments were sampled on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 for the detection of pathogens. The persistence of M. paratuberculosis was also assessed by a PCR hybridization assay. After 56 days of composting, from 45 to 60% of the carbon in the compost treatments was converted to CO2, while no significant change in carbon content was observed in the liquid slurry. Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Listeria were all detected in the manure and all of the treatments on day 0. After 3 days of composting at 55\u00b0C, none of these organisms were detectable. In liquid manure and pack treatments, some of these microorganisms were detectable up to 28 days. M. paratuberculosis was detected by standard culture only on day 0 in all the treatments, but was undetectable in any treatment at 3 and 7 days. On days 14, 28, and 56, M. paratuberculosis was detected in the liquid storage treatment but remained undetectable in the compost and pack treatments. However, M. paratuberculosis DNA was detectable through day 56 in all treatments and up to day 175 in liquid storage treatments. Taken together, the results indicate that high-temperature composting is more effective than pack storage or liquid storage of manure in reducing these pathogens in dairy manure.

Combining the transport and storage sections leads to inconsistent calculations.

Such minerals are enriched in calcium, magnesium and iron and are known to dissolve in CO2-enriched, low-pH water. With more reactive sheet silicates, the intraformational baffles provide a source of potentially mobilised cations for subsequent carbonate precipitation.

That integration will require a wide range of data interactions and data flows and an increasingly more intelligent energy network that must address renewable energy integration as well as energy network capacity, safety and efficiency. It will also require an increasing involvement from the end-user with a greater potential for influencing behaviour change. But the questions remain? What capacities of energy storage are required?

The energy infrastructure requires investment, and re-design, to continue to meet predicted UK demand whilst aiding in a reduction in CO2 emissions and improving supply security. Four outline transition pathways have been developed that depict a diverse range of realistic predictions for the transition of the UK gas and electricity infrastructure to a low carbon economy from 2008 until 2052.

Assessments of C and nutrient balances and cycling within agroecosystems or of greenhouse gas emissions often assume average C and nutrient mass fractions in manure, disregarding the impact that manure storage may have on C and nutrient losses from the system. To quantify such losses, in order to refine our models of C and nutrient cycling in smallholder (crop-livestock) farming systems, an experiment was conducted reproducing farmers\u2019 practices: heaps vs. pits of a mix of cattle manure and maize stover (2:3\u00a0v/v) stored in the open air during 6\u00a0months. Heaps stored under a simple roof were also evaluated as an affordable improvement of the storage conditions. The results were used to derive empirical models and graphs for the estimation of C and nutrient losses. Heaps and pits were turned every month, weighed, and sampled to determine organic matter, total and mineral N, P and K mass fractions. Soils beneath heaps/pits were sampled to measure mineral N to a depth of 1\u00a0m, and leaching tube tests in the laboratory were used to estimate P leaching from manure. After 6\u00a0months, ca. 70% remained of the initial dry mass of manure stored in pits, but only half of or less of the manure stored in heaps. The stored manure lost 45% of its C in the open air and 69% under roof. The efficiencies of nutrient retention during storage varied between 24\u201338% for total N, 34\u201338% for P and 18\u201334% for K, with the heaps under a roof having greater efficiencies of retention of N and K. Laboratory tests indicated that up to 25% of the P contained in fresh manure could be lost by leaching. Results suggest that reducing the period of storage by, for example, more frequent application and incorporation of manure into the soil may have a larger impact on retaining C and nutrient within the farm system than improving storage conditions.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "3e6478b72e9fb486a5f6d23bd7108c0f84372a7d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2593112037", "CorpusId": 131836713}, "title": "Cost Effective Greenhouse Gas Mitigation in the Ontario Dairy Sector", "abstract": "COST EFFECTIVE GREENHOUSE GAS MITIGATION IN THE ONTARIO DAIRY SECTOR James Hawkins Advisor: University of Guelph, 2014 Professor A.

A linear programming model is developed to account for emissions both from the farm as well as from the production of feed and other inputs upstream. The results indicate that changing rations can reduce GHG emissions from milk production by up to 35% from original levels, with a corresponding decline in farm gross margin of 23.4%. The cause of the declines in GHG emissions is because corn silage is replaced by high quality perennial forage (alfalfa hay). This allows for an increase in carbon storage in land, due to the enhanced carbon storage capacity of perennial forages as opposed to annual crops (i.e. corn), and due to lower capital and chemical inputs. The implications are that there is large potential for reducing GHG emissions from milk production in Ontario due to the potential for perennial forages to capture and store carbon in soil. This necessitates that perennial forages replace corn silage as the primary source of roughage in dairy rations. Current rations have corn silage as about 20% of dry matter intake.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "aede402084e48066756ca37e22940ea8085fe35c", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "7227094", "MAG": "2996746440", "DOI": "10.1186/s13021-019-0134-8", "CorpusId": 209410763, "PubMed": "31858282"}, "title": "The accuracy of species-specific allometric equations for estimating aboveground biomass in tropical moist montane forests: case study of Albizia grandibracteata and Trichilia dregeana", "abstract": "BackgroundApplication of allometric equations for quantifying forests aboveground biomass is a crucial step related to efforts of climate change mitigation. Generalized allometric equations have been applied for estimating biomass and carbon storage of forests. However, adopting a generalized allometric equation to estimate the biomass of different forests generates uncertainty due to environmental variation. Therefore, formulating species-specific allometric equations is important to accurately quantify the biomass. Montane moist forest ecosystem comprises high forest type which is mainly found in the southwestern part of Ethiopia. Yayu Coffee Forest Biosphere Reserve is categorized into Afromontane Rainforest vegetation types in this ecosystem. This study was aimed to formulate species-specific allometric equations for Albizia grandibracteata Tuab. and Trichilia dregeana Sond. using the semi-destructive method.ResultsAllometric equations in form of power models were developed for each tree species by evaluating the statistical relationships of total aboveground biomass (TAGB) and dendrometric variables. TAGB was regressed against diameter at breast height (D), total height (H), and wood density (\u03c1) individually and in a combination. The allometric equations were selected based on model performance statistics. Equations with the higher coefficient of determination (adj.R2), lower residual standard error (RSE), and low Akaike information criterion (AIC) values were found best fitted. Relationships between TAGB and predictive variables were found statistically significant (p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001) for all selected equations.

In addition, the volatility of renewables in generating and dispatching power entails a new focus on electricity security. This reinforces the importance of gas turbines in guaranteeing grid reliability by compensating for the intermittency of renewables.\n In order to achieve the Paris Agreement\u2019s goals, power generation must be decarbonized. This is where hydrogen produced from renewables or with CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) comes into play, allowing totally CO2-free combustion. Hydrogen features the unique capability to store energy for medium to long storage cycles and hence could be used to alleviate seasonal variations of renewable power generation. The importance of hydrogen for future power generation is expected to increase due to several factors: the push for CO2-free energy production is calling for various options, all resulting in the necessity of a broader fuel flexibility, in particular accommodating hydrogen as a future fuel feeding gas turbines and combined cycle power plants. Hydrogen from methane reforming is pursued, with particular interest within energy scenarios linked with carbon capture and storage, while the increased share of renewables requires the storage of energy for which hydrogen is the best candidate.\n Compared to natural gas the main challenge of hydrogen combustion is its increased reactivity resulting in a decrease of engine performance for conventional premix combustion systems. The sequential combustion technology used within Ansaldo Energia\u2019s GT36 and GT26 gas turbines provides for extra freedom in optimizing the operation concept. This sequential combustion technology enables low emission combustion at high temperatures with particularly high fuel flexibility thanks to the complementarity between its first stage, stabilized by flame propagation and its second (sequential) stage, stabilized by auto-ignition. With this concept, gas turbines are envisaged to be able to provide reliable, dispatchable, CO2-free electric power.\n In this paper, an overview of hydrogen production (grey, blue, and green hydrogen), transport and storage are presented targeting a CO2-free energy system based on gas turbines. A detailed description of the test infrastructure, handling of highly reactive fuels is given with specific aspects of the large amounts of hydrogen used for the full engine pressure tests.\n Based on the results discussed at last year\u2019s Turbo Expo (Bothien et al.

Thirdly, more advanced methods of enzyme immobilization were reported for the stabilization of enzyme activity. In another approach, new nanostructures were fabricated surrounding each enzyme molecule to prevent the enzyme denaturation more effectively. The successful enzyme stabilization has opened up a new potential for the practical enzyme applications, which were hampered due to poor enzyme stability. Finally, the effects of nano-environments on enzymes have been investigated beyond conventional understanding of polar, charge, hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. As an example, the crowding and confinement effects on enzyme activity were reported, which would eventually help to understand the mechanism of enzyme reactions in a cell environment that are highly crowded with biomolecules. American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) has opened sessions for the theme of second-generation nanobiocatalysis under the title of \u2018\u2018Nanoscale Science and Engineering in Biomolecular Catalysis (Interaction)\u2019\u2019 during the last 8 years. This special issue of Topics in Catalysis contains contributions from the participants in the sessions of nanobiocatalysis at AIChE Annual Meetings and in the symposia of \u2018\u2018Biological Fuel Cells\u2019\u2019 at the ECS Meetings. This issue is devoted to the recent developments in second-generation nanobiocatalysis and its potential applications in biosensors, J.

Due to the inherent use of coal in an integrated steel making process as a source of energy and as a reductant, total decarbonization of currently operating plants is extremely difficult. Most of the carbon used in steel making process is emitted to the atmosphere in the form of CO2. Obviously, the steel industry is emission intensive, contributing 7% of global CO2 emissions. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from steelmaking is necessary to meet the challenges of climate change. A portfolio of technologies and approaches will be needed to address the decarbonisation challenge, while supporting steel industry competitiveness. This paper explores the technologies and strategies to reduce CO2 emissions from an integrated steel plant. Improving energy efficiency of steel making process is the first step in emission reduction. However, it is limited by thermodynamic constraints. Based on the current state of development, Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCUS), Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) are found to be the suitable technologies from the breakthrough technologies identified by World Steel Association to reduce CO2 emissions from iron and steel making process. It has been estimated that CCS can reduce the CO2 emissions from an integrated steel plant potentially by 40%. Suitability of both chemical and biochemical technologies to utilise steel plant off gases for producing value added chemicals are investigated. Combination of CCUS and CCS may be an attractive option in terms of comprehensive emission reduction. Availability of hydrogen will improve utilisation of steel plant off gases. The economic feasibility of CO2 re-use options relies on the efficiency of carbon conversion, the value of the intended products and the availability of cheap renewable power and in some cases, hydrogen.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "e5e8692ec630fd7930022c78ddcfc1101f3a0d47", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2611398093", "DOI": "10.4236/MSCE.2017.54006", "CorpusId": 99739748}, "title": "Evaluation of Carbon Dioxide Absorption Characteristics Lithium Ortho-Silicate in Chemical Heat Storage", "abstract": "We report the development of technology that may contribute to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and improve the energy efficiency of the CO2 capture process. Lithium ortho-silicate is a suitable solid sorbent for capturing CO2. This reversible chemical reaction is also applicable to chemical heat storage. The absorption reaction characteristics of lithium ortho-silicate were studied by a thermogravimetric method and a volumetric method that demonstrated the influence of heat and mass transfer limitations in a packed bed designed to be as small as possible. We developed a method for measuring the absorption reaction characteristics in the experiments. In the experiments, a constant conversion fraction of 60% was observed. The reaction system was stable to repetition. The CO2 absorption rate depends on the CO2 pressure and reactor temperature. The absorption rate was determined at several reactor temperatures when the conversion fraction was 0.3. In this study, the maximum absorption rate was obtained at 670oC. It was demonstrated that lithium ortho-silicate is suitable for use in a chemical heat storage system.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "089ff4750af14cf567f0bbcf2bdd879c210fb72a", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 245149114}, "title": "Sequestration and Enhanced Methane Recovery with Respect to Gas Reservoir Properties of Australian Coals", "abstract": "Since 1995 coal seam methane (CSM) production in Australia has increased significantly, particularly in Queensland where currently about 40% of the state\u2019s gas consumption is supplied from coal seam methane; Queensland has CSM resources of about 150 to 500 kPJ (~250 TCF) and reserves of up to 6 kPJ (6 TCF). Carbon capture and sequestration may allow Australian dependence upon coal and gas for electricity generation to continue to rise without consequential major increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. However NSW and Queensland are deficient in suitable geological structures, for CO2 sequestration, such as depleted oil and gas reservoirs, close to the main sources of CO2 production, in particular power plants. In the absence of these geological reservoirs, extensive coal formations, particularly deep, unmineable seams, potentially with CSM potential, are favourable for sequestration. Both storage and flow properties of reservoirs are vital to the success of CO2 enhanced coalbed methane recovery (CO2-ECBM), with the ultimate aim of CO2 sequestration in coal seams. Reservoir characterization of about forty Australian coals from the Sydney and Bowen Basins were extensively measured and studied to enable the evaluation of their suitability for CO2 sequestration and ECBM. Coal rank for the samples varies from low volatile bituminous to high volatile bituminous (Ro max of 0.6 to 1.7%). The sample depths vary from less than 100 m to more than 1000 m. Using a newly developed system for measuring gas storage and flow properties at the appropriate depth/pressure conditions gives improved assessments of CO2 and CH4 flow behaviours.", "year": 2006}]}
