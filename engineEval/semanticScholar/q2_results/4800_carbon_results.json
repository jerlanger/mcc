One of the most effective mechanisms to tore CO2 captured from power plants is via geological injection of CO 2 into formations that contain calcium and magnesium silicate and alumino-silicate minerals and rocks. The mechanism that ensures permanent storage of CO 2 within rocks is mineral carbonation. When CO 2 is injected into mineral or rock formations rich i n calcium or magnesium silicates, they react with CO 2 to form calcium or magnesium carbonates, which is also known as carbon mineralization. Calci um and magnesium carbonates are stable and insoluble in water. However, the kinetics of in-situ mineral carbonation involve CO 2 hydration, mineral dissolution and formation of carbonates, an d the relative rates of these phenomena when coupled, are not very well understood. In this study, the coupled interactions of CO 2-reaction fluid-minerals were investigated to determine the optimal conditions for carbon mineral ization, and to identify the chemical and morphological changes in the minerals as they react to form carbonates. Carbon mineralization in various minerals and rocks such as olivine ((Mg,Fe) 2SiO4)), labradorite ((Ca, Na)(Al, Si) 4O8), anorthosite (mixture of anorthite (CaAl 2Si2O8), and basalt (rock comprising various minerals) were studied at high temperatures (T max = 185 C) and high partial pressures of CO 2 (PCO2, max = 164 atm) which are relevant for in-situ conditions. These minerals and rocks differ consid erably in their chemical compositions and reactivity with CO2. A systematic comparison of the effects of reaction time, temperature, partial pressure of CO2, and fluid composition on the conversion of these magnesium and calcium bearing minerals and rocks showed that olivine was the most reactive mineral followed by labradorite, anorthosi te, and basalt, respectively. Previous studies at Albany Research Center (Gerdem ann et al., 2007; O\u2019Connor et al., 2004) reported that a solution of 1.0 M NaCl + 0.64 M NaHCO3 was effective in achieving high extents of carbonation in olivine, heat-treated ser pentine, and wollastonite. However, the independent effects of NaCl and NaHCO 3 and their role in mineral carbonation were not sufficiently explained. In this study, the role of varying concentrations of NaCl and NaHCO 3 on carbon mineralization of various minerals was eluci dated. NaHCO3 buffered the pH and served as a carbon carrier, resulting in higher carbonate conversions. Except in the case of olivine, NaCl had a negligible effect on enhancing mineral carbon ati . Unlike NaHCO3, NaCl does not buffer the pH or serve as a carbon carrier, but Cl may serve as a weak chelating agent can complex with Mg or Ca in the mineral matrix to enhance diss olution. The competing effects of ionic strength and pH swings as the mineral dissolves and c rbonation further complicate the role of NaCl on mineral carbonation. Based on the experimental methodologies developed to study carbon mineralization in minerals and rocks at high temperatures and pressur , alternative applications such as the remediation of hazardous alkaline wastes such as as bestos containing materials were identified. Asbestos is composed of chrysotile, a fibrous hydra te magnesium silicate mineral and a form of serpentine known to cause respiratory illnesses. By treating asbestos containing materials with CO2 in the presence of 0.1 M Na-oxalate, dissolution o f chrysotile and precipitation of newer phases such as glushinkite (Mg(C 2O4)\u2022 2H2O) and magnesite (MgCO 3) occurred, which reduced the chrysotile content in asbestos. Based on the methodologies for studying mineral di ssolution and carbonation kinetics, and coupled mineral dissolution and carbonation beh avior, a scheme for connecting laboratory scale experiments with simulations to estimate the uncertainties associated with carbon mineralization was developed. The effects of temper ature, different dissolution rates, and varying levels of surface area changes due to passivation o r reactive cracking on the rates of carbon mineralization were simulated using PhreeqC, a comp uter program developed for geochemical speciation calculations (Parkhurst & Appelo, 1999). Various studies proposed that microfractures and cracks may occur in geologic formations due to the extensive growth of carbonate crystals (Kelemen & Hirth, 2012; Kelemen & Matter, 2008; Mat ter & Kelemen, 2009; Rudge et al., 2010). Other studies have suggested that the format ion of carbonates may plug the pore spaces and limit further reactivity (H\u00f6velmann et al., 201 2; King et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2004). The effects of changes in surface area due to the forma tion of microfractures or passivation due to carbonate growth on the rates of carbon mineralizat ion were also simulated. Overall the results of these studies demonstrate t he effect of various parameters on carbon mineralization and how these parameters can be connected to predict CO 2 storage in mineral formations. The frameworks to connect labor tory scale experiments with simulations to determine carbon mineralization rates and to assess th risks associated with CO 2 injection in reactive formations, can be used to direct future r esearch efforts to predict the fate of injected CO2 with greater accuracy for sensor placement and opt imization of CO2 monitoring technologies.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "e24b1a6aaaa67ac817fbf9b134dfafd34ec25a95", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3165116806", "DOI": "10.1029/2021GL092764", "CorpusId": 236406235}, "title": "Tree Canopies Reflect Mycorrhizal Composition", "abstract": "Mycorrhizae alter global patterns of CO2 fertilization, carbon storage, and elemental cycling, yet knowledge of their global distributions is currently limited by the availability of forest inventory data.

First, an optimization framework (based on comprehensive spatio-temporal techno-economic analysis) is used to map out optimal transition pathways if H2 were to be introduced in the Dutch transport sector. It is observed that a centralized supply network (with production facilities based on the Rotterdam area and H2 is trucked to other regions) will be necessary, in the base-case scenario with 25% market penetration of fuel cell vehicles by 2050. Second, a critical quantitative and qualitative assessment is carried out to understand when do (or can) other production technologies become economically competitive with steam methane reforming (SMR), to produce H2. For instance, in the case of coal gasification (CG), for a medium size plant (\u223c150 tpd), coal ($ /MMBtu) needs to be about 7$ cheaper than natural gas ($ /MMBtu) for CG, at its current state of the technology, to be economically competitive with SMR. Third, since the evolution and eventually the success of fossil-based H2 economy, especially during the transition period, may partly depend on the prospects for the carbon capture and storage (CCS), a qualitative assessment of the Dutch CCS potential and current activities is carried out.

CCS-technologies received wide attention after the signing of Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change (1997), which went into effect in 2005, and its instruments to reduce CO2 emissions. An important element of the Kyoto Protocol are the tradable certified emission reduction units (CERs), which are based on national emissions in 1990 and can be created via certain instruments and bought or sold as necessary. Thus, if a national economy produces more emissions now than it did in 1990, it will have to create or buy CERs.

We also examined the origin of fracture-filling calcite veins, the properties of self-sealing fluids, the influence of fluids on the compositions of mudstone, and established a bleaching model for the study area. Our results show that iron concretions are the oxidative products of precursor minerals (pyrite and siderite) during uplift and are linked to H2S and CO2 present in early stage fluids. The precipitation of calcite veins is the result of CO2 degassing and is related to CO2, CH4, and minor heavy hydrocarbons in the main bleaching fluids. In our model, fluids preferentially enter high-permeability fracture systems and result in the bleaching of surrounding rocks and precipitation of calcite veins. The infilling of calcite veins significantly decreases the permeability of fractures and forces the fluids to slowly enter and bleach the mudstone rocks. The Fe2+ released during bleaching migrates to elsewhere with the solutions or is re-precipitated in the calcite veins and iron concretions. The formation of calcite veins reduces the fracture space and effectively prevents fluid flow. The fluids have an insignificant effect on minerals within the mudstone. In terms of the chemistry of the mudstone, only the contents of Fe2O3, U, and Mo change significantly, with the content of U increasing in the mudstone and the contents of Fe2O3 and Mo decreasing during bleaching. \n \nThis article is protected by copyright.

The Boise Wallula paper mill is located near the township of Wallula in Southeastern Washington State. Infrastructure at the paper mill will be upgraded such that current steam needs and a significant portion of the current mill electric power are supplied from a 100% biomass power source. A new biomass power system will be constructed with an integrated amine-based CO2 capture plant to capture approximately 550,000 tons of CO2 per year for geologic sequestration. A customized version of Fluor Corporation\u2019s Econamine Plus\u2122 carbon capture technology will be designed to accommodate the specific chemical composition of exhaust gases from the biomass boiler. Due to the use of biomass for fuel, employing CCS technology represents a unique opportunity to generate a net negative carbon emissions footprint, which on an equivalent emissions reduction basis is 1.8X greater than from equivalent fossil fuel sources (SPATH and MANN, 2004). Furthermore, the proposed project will offset a significant amount of current natural gas use at the mill, equating to an additional 200,000 tons of avoided CO2 emissions. Hence, the total net emissions avoided through this project equates to 1,100,000 tons of CO2 per year. Successful execution of this project will provide a clear path forward for similar kinds of emissions reduction that can be replicated at other energy-intensive industrial facilities where the geology is suitable for sequestration. This project also represents a first opportunity for commercial development of geologic storage of CO2 in deep flood basalt formations. The Boise paper mill site is host to a Phase II pilot study being carried out under DOE\u2019s Regional Carbon Partnership Program. Lessons learned from this pilot study and other separately funded projects studying CO2 sequestration in basalts will be heavily leveraged in developing a suitable site characterization program and system design for permanent sequestration of captured CO2. The areal extent, very large thickness, high permeability in portions of the flows, and presence of multiple very low permeability flow interior seals combine to produce a robust sequestration target.

At the time the UNFCCC was established, the 24 members of the OECD in 1990 and 16 other European countries and Russia were considered liable for \u201cthe largest share of historical and current global emissions of GHG\u201d and taken up in Annex I to the UNFCCC. These Annex I countries and the European Union1 submit annually complete inventories of GHG emissions from the 1990 base year2 until the latest year for which full accounting is completed and reviewed (typically with a 2-year time lag), and these inventories are all reviewed to ensure transparency, completeness, comparability, consistency and accuracy3. This allows for most of these Annex I countries to track progress towards their reduction targets committed under the Kyoto Protocol (UNFCCC, 1997). Other (non-Annex I) countries are encouraged to submit their GHG inventories as part of their National Communications and Biennial Update Reports (BURs). The GHG inventories of nonAnnex I countries were required to cover CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions for 1 year (1990 or 1994), without specific documentation and only subject to a brief review. However, the Paris Agreement (UNFCCC, 2015) requires submission every 2 years of BURs4, which are subject to international consultation and analysis. Theoretically, UNFCCC should receive at the latest after 2 years national emissions inventories from each of the 197 countries, but as shown in Fig. 1a, not all countries did provide a national inventory and 154 countries did not provide a completed (i.e. year-2) time se1This includes the 28 Member States of the European Union (EU) as of 1 July 2013. 2For some economies in transition, another year such as 1988 or 1989 can be chosen under UNFCCC as the base year. These GHG emissions are mainly sources, but also include carbon stock sinks for which the human-induced part needs to be assessed with care (Grassi et al., 2018). 3These five principles of a good reporting practice are defined in the UNFCCC guidelines for national GHG inventory, e.g. https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/3c30/ a1bd769dee5299746e0af825c7ab4ed55fba.pdf.

In addition, many countries lack a welldeveloped statistical infrastructure, which is needed for an accurate bottom-up (BU) inventory. Figure 1b presents the latest year that is covered with a national inventory, with dates for quite a few countries more than 10 years ago: for most South-East Asian countries this is between 2004 and 2007 and for most African countries between 2000 and 2003. As such, the collection of national reports/communications does not provide a complete, consistent and comparable global dataset which can be used to understand the global budgets of the most important GHG emissions and their impact on climate. Very few bottom-up inventories of global anthropogenic emissions have been produced with continued effort for more than 2 decades. The Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC) (Boden et al., 2017; Andres et al., 2014) and the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) (Olivier and Janssens-Maenhout, 2016; Olivier et al., 2016) provide global totals, whereas the IEA provides CO2 estimates from fuel combustion only and the FAO CH4 from agriculture only. While CDIAC ceased operation in September 2017, the Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO2 (ODIAC) (Oda et al., 2018) continued to use the CDIAC data and combined these with geospatial proxies (including night light satellite maps) to provide CO2 grid maps, as EDGAR is also doing (using other geospatial proxies). In addition, the new Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) of Hoesly et al. (2018) builds upon existing inventories to provide a new gridded dataset of all emission species for the Climate Model Inter-comparison Programme CMIP6. The scientific community started to bring together these anthropogenic BU emissions with top-down estimates covering also the natural component to obtain the Global Carbon Budget (GCB) (Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 et al., 2018) and the Global Methane Budget (Saunois et al., 2016). These budgets are important input for the periodic global stocktake that the Paris Agreement envisages from 2023 onwards (with the submitted inventories for 2021). Even though significant progress in inventory compilation has been made, the overall uncertainty of the global total has become larger over time because the share of emissions from non-Annex I countries (with less developed statistical infrastructure) increased from less than 40 % in 1990 to more than 60 % in 2012, as shown in Fig. 2.

The EDGAR v4.3.2 global inventory illustrates the result of a bottom-up technology-based compilation of countryand sector-specific emission time series for 1970\u20132012. Furthermore, the monthly resolution and global grid maps at a spatial resolution of 0.1\u00d7 0.1 allow direct use in atmospheric models as well as in analyses of policy impacts. The first version of the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR v2) answered the needs of the air quality community to map technological parameters of air pollution sources and was published by Olivier et al. (1996). Since then, several updated versions (Olivier, 2002) have been released (EDGAR-HYDE, EDGAR v3.2, EDGAR 3.2 FT2000). Driven by the development of scientific knowledge on emission generating processes and by the availability of more recent information, the EDGAR v4 datasets were constructed including new emission factors and additional end-of-pipe abatement measures. The specification of the combustion technology and its endof-pipe abatement is more important for air pollutants and aerosols than for GHGs.

Promising strategies include the conversion of waste biomass to hydrogen, methane, liquid fuels, or electricity coupled with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). A key challenge for these projects is the need to connect geographically dispersed biomass supplies with geologic storage sites by either transporting biomass or CO2. We assess the cost of transport for biomass conversion projects with CCS using publicly available cost data for trucking, rail, and CO2 pipelines in the United States. We find that for large projects (order of 1 Mt/yr CO2 or greater), CO2 by pipeline is the lowest cost option. However, for projects that send most of the biomass carbon to storage, such as gasification to hydrogen or electricity production, biomass by rail is a competitive option. For smaller projects and lower fractions of carbon sent to storage, such as for pyrolysis to liquid fuels, CO2 by rail is the lowest cost option. Assessing three plausible example projects in the United States, we estimate that total transport costs range from $24/t-CO2 stored for a gasification to hydrogen project traversing 670 km to $36/t for a gasification to renewable natural gas project traversing 530 km. In general, if developers have flexibility in choosing transport mode and project type, biomass sources and storage sites can be connected across hundreds of kilometers for transport costs in the range of $20-40/t-CO2 stored.

A major characteristic of IAMs is that their geophysical sector determines the mean surface temperature increase over the preindustrial level, which in turn determines the damage function. Most of the existing IAMs are perfect-foresight forward-looking models, assuming that we know all of the future information. However, there are significant uncertainties in the climate and economic system, including parameter uncertainty, model uncertainty, climate tipping risks, economic risks, and ambiguity. For example, climate damages are uncertain: some researchers assume that climate damages are proportional to instantaneous output, while others assume that climate damages have a more persistent impact on economic growth. Climate tipping risks represent (nearly) irreversible climate events that may lead to significant changes in the climate system, such as the Greenland ice sheet collapse, while the conditions, probability of tipping, duration, and associated damage are also uncertain. Technological progress in carbon capture and storage, adaptation, renewable energy, and energy efficiency are uncertain too. In the face of these uncertainties, policymakers have to provide a decision that considers important factors such as risk aversion, inequality aversion, and sustainability of the economy and ecosystem. Solving this problem may require richer and more realistic models than standard IAMs, and advanced computational methods.

Mg has a wide range of atomic charges. In the case of GR\u2013Mg (m = 0, Mg atom), the binding energy of one H2 molecule is close to 0, whereas those for m = 1 (Mg+) and 2 (Mg2+) are 0.23 and 13.2 kcal/mol (n = 1), respectively.

When carbon is removed from forests through harvest, a portion of the harvested carbon is stored in wood products, often for many decades. The United States Forest Service (USFS) and other agencies are interested in accurately accounting for carbon flux associated with harvested wood products (HWP) to meet greenhouse gas monitoring commitments and climate change adaptation and mitigation objectives. National-level forest carbon accounting has been in place for over a decade, but there is an increasing need for accounting for smaller scale administrative units, including USFS National Forest System regions and individual National Forests. This paper uses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) production accounting approach to estimate HWP carbon storage from 1909 to 2012 for the USFS Pacific Southwest Region. For the Pacific Southwest Region as a whole, carbon stocks in the HWP pool were increasing at just below 1 million megagrams of carbon (MgC) per year beginning in the late 1940's until the early 1990's, with peak cumulative storage of 51 million MgC occurring in 1994. Net positive flux into the HWP pool over this period is primarily attributable to high harvest levels during the 1960's through 1980's. In the years between the late 1960s and 1990 timber harvest were at high but volatile levels, with high harvests of over 4.3 million ccf (3.2 million MgC) occurring five times during this period, harvest levels from National Forests have since declined to less than 1.1 million ccf (0.8 million MgC) per year, resulting in less carbon entering the HWP pool. Since 1995, emissions from HWP at solid waste disposal sites exceeded additions from harvesting, resulting in a decline in the total amount of carbon stored in the HWP pool. The Pacific Southwest Region's HWP pool is now in a period of negative net annual stock change because the decay of products harvested between 1909 and 2012 exceeds additions of carbon to the HWP pool through harvest. Together with estimates of ecosystem carbon, which are also being developed through the Forest Management Carbon Framework (ForCaMF), Regional level estimates of HWP carbon flux can be used to inform management decisions and guide climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts by the agency. Though our emphasis is on the Pacific Southwest Region as a whole, this accounting method can be applied more broadly at smaller land management units, such as National Forests.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "09e83a38163db9d514ee62dc27f77117934a5a27", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2410844134", "DOI": "10.4122/1.1000000156", "CorpusId": 114384536}, "title": "CO2 Capture via Carbonate Looping", "abstract": "Coal fired power plants account for 40% of worldwide CO2 emissions.

This is especially critical for entities with large areas of forested land, such as public agencies and land-based private companies, as the potentially significant amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere could be accounted for as a net reduction in an organization\u2019s annual GHG emissions. Although there are relatively few examples to draw from for incorporating forest carbon sinks in an organizational level GHG emissions inventory, this paper provides timely guidance and concrete examples in the following three areas: best practices for calculating carbon sinks, recent developments in carbon sink guidance and U.S. reporting programs, and recommendations for including carbon sinks in an organizational GHG emissions inventory. Recent developments in U.S. GHG reporting programs are critical for considering if and how to include forest carbon sinks in an organizational level emissions inventory. This paper includes a review of the latest emissions inventory guidance in the IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry, the GHG Protocol\u2019s Land Use, Land-Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF) Guidance for GHG Project Accounting, ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability\u2019s Urban Forestry Toolkit, and the California Climate Action Registry and Chicago Climate Exchange requirements for emissions reduction forestry projects. INTRODUCTION Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions accounting is an area of growing interest and concern for public agency and private organization managers because of the expanding opportunities in emissions reporting and GHG emission registries, the potential for carbon offsets production, and the growing pressure for GHG accountability in the public sector. Although it is quickly becoming more streamlined and standardized, the practice of GHG emissions accounting and reporting in the U.S. is still plagued with inconsistencies due to the variety of emerging policies and programs in different jurisdictions, and the disparity in reporting requirements for different public and private programs. Carbon sequestration is the process of incorporating atmospheric carbon into plants, soils, and water. Those resources or processes that incorporate atmospheric carbon are commonly referred to as \u201ccarbon sinks\u201d because of their ability to take up, as opposed to emit, GHG emissions. However, carbon sequestration calculations can be difficult to perform, due to data requirements, complexity of estimation methodologies and uncertainties. Many factors, including geographic location, temperature, humidity, and species dominance, will affect the rate of carbon sequestered by forested land in a given area. The calculation of affects impacting factors, but not directly connected with the carbon cycle or GHG effects, presents an additional level of complexity This paper on GHG emissions accounting provides an overview of accounting and reporting protocols for emissions inventories that may include carbon sinks; a review of carbon sinks and recommendations 2 for calculating carbon capture from biological sequestration; and insights into emerging standards and practices for carbon sinks reporting. STANDARDS, PROTOCOLS AND PRINCIPLES The current practice of GHG emissions accounting is guided by two main sources of standards and protocols: The Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol) of the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD); and The technical reports and methodology guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Although several programs for reporting, registering and trading emissions exist throughout the U.S. and abroad, they are mainly based on the standards and protocols of the GHG Protocol and IPCC guidelines, which are widely accepted as best practice in GHG emissions accounting. A third standard which is specific to cities and municipal agencies was developed by ICLEI-Local Governments for Sustainability (ICLEI). In April 2007, the USEPA released an inventory of U.S. GHG emission inventories and sinks for 1990 through 2005 (the U.S. national GHG inventory). The inventory makes use of the IPCC guidelines including the updates presented in 2006 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. The inventory developed included a key category analysis for the Inventory which was consistent with IPCC\u2019s LULUCF guidelines for a Tier 1 approach. This analysis looks at prioritized sink/source categories considered to be a significant influence on the total national inventory either in terms of emissions or trends in emissions. The Tier 1 analysis quantitatively identifies key categories from LULUCF categories as well as other, while qualitatively assessment of source categories not captured in the quantitative analysis. Accounting and Reporting Principles According to the Corporate GHG Accounting and Reporting Module (WRI/WBCSD March 2004), the following principles should be applied to the process of accounting for and reporting GHG emissions: \u201cRelevance Ensure the GHG inventory appropriately reflects the GHG emissions of the organization and serves the decision-making needs of users \u2013 both internal and external to the organization; \u201cCompleteness Account for and report on all GHG emission sources and activities within the chosen inventory boundary. Disclose and justify any specific exclusions; \u201cConsistency Use consistent methodologies to allow for meaningful comparisons of emissions over time. Transparently document any changes to the data, inventory boundary, methods, or any other relevant factors in the time series; \u201cTransparency Address all relevant issues in a factual and coherent manner, based on a clear audit trail. Disclose any relevant assumptions and make appropriate references to the accounting and calculation methodologies and data sources used; and \u201cAccuracy Ensure that the quantification of GHG emissions is systematically neither over nor under actual emissions, as far as can be judged, and that uncertainties are reduced as far as practicable. Achieve sufficient accuracy to enable users to make decisions with reasonable assurance as to the integrity of the reported information.\u201d", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "be8c2c09289c29f4773d148f362fb6ff576b02cc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "428086849", "DOI": "10.1201/B10163", "CorpusId": 108159840}, "title": "Green energy : technology, economics and policy", "abstract": "Section 1: Introduction (U.Aswathanarayana) Section 2: Renewable EnergyTechnologies (U.Aswathanarayana) Chapter 1 Renewables and climate change (U.

Two different cementing procedures are involved in the latter problem: primary cementing and squeeze cementing. Here we consider how to track the interface between two fluids during primary cementing. The main idea is to exploit the density difference between successive fluids pumped in order to design a tracer particle to sit at the interface.

Renewable hydrogen generation is a viable solution since this energy vector can be produced from electricity with a fast response and injected in the existing natural gas infrastructures, granting storage capacity and easy transport. Parallelly to the renewable-based energy production, fossil-based energy can be exploited with a low carbon impact, using methane from reservoirs to produce hydrogen capturing CO2. The mentioned scenarios will lead to hydrogen enrichment of natural gas, which impact on the infrastructures is being actively studied.

This report fi nds that by 2020, emission reductions of greater than 30 per cent below 1990 levels are possible, but only with a wide range of concerted actions in the energy, industry and land-use sectors. If the contributions from energy effi ciency in the residential, commercial and industrial sectors are combined into a single category, energy effi ciency emerges as the major source of greenhouse gas reduction to 2020. Renewable electricity with gas cogeneration could provide the largest potential \u201cwedge\u201d of supply-side reduction. Other large potential emission savings could be obtained from halting land clearing and cutting fugitive emissions from fossil fuel production and distribution. Urgent policy development and implementation, by both federal and state governments, is needed to facilitate these and other technologies and measures. 1. Interim greenhouse gas targets are vital To prevent runaway global warming, which would become very likely if global average temperatures exceed 2 \u030aC above pre-industrial levels, the world community must cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 60 per cent by 2050. In line with their responsibility for a greater share of historic emissions, developed countries would have to make reductions of at least 80 per cent in this time frame. To get on track to this target, interim targets are vital. These are particularly important in the light of evidence being published, which shows that global warming is accelerating under the action of several amplifi cation processes. A number of climate scientists and policy analysts are advising that developed nations must make GHG emission cuts of at least 30 per cent relative to 1990 levels by 2020, in order to make timely progress toward the long-term global target (Den Elzen, 2005). However, no Australian government, state or federal, has set interim reduction targets for dates earlier than 2050. The dearth of interim targets may be explained by both major Australian political parties\u2019 hope that domestic emissions may in future be addressed by unproven technology which aims to capture, transport and bury greenhouse pollution from coal-fi red power stations (carbon capture and storage, or CCS). Yet an interdisciplinary panel of experts found that almost two decades will pass before global pick up of CCS is possible, should the technology prove to be feasible (Ansolabehere et al., 2007). 2. Business-as-usual demand growth is not sustainable The baseline or reference case for this study is the business-as-usual (BAU) \u201cwith measures\u201d scenario published by the Australian Greenhouse Offi ce (AGO). This scenario envisages annual emissions growth from 565 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) in 2004, to 702 Mt in 2020, a total growth of 24 per cent. Such a rapid growth, if it actually comes to pass, poses an enormous challenge to an emissions reduction program. If such rapid growth is allowed to eventuate and continue beyond 2020, it would completely swamp any technological reduction measures that could be implemented over the next quarter-century. Nevertheless, we have used this AGO scenario as a baseline to 2020, while recognising that growth in energy demand and its associated emissions must be halted. 1 AAP Australian General News Wed 18 Apr 2007 6:52 pm.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "e9e668f294e4a854b89073674f2e9183b2eb85dc", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "7372955", "MAG": "3041316470", "DOI": "10.1155/2020/8815263", "CorpusId": 221033574, "PubMed": "32760214"}, "title": "Simulation of a Novel Tubular Microalgae Photobioreactor with Aerated Tangent Inner Tubes: Improvements in Mixing Performance and Flashing-Light Effects", "abstract": "At present, large-scale and high-efficiency microalgal cultivation is the key to realizing the technology for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and bioresource recovery. Meanwhile, tubular photobioreactors (PBRs) have great potential for microalgal cultivation due to their high productivity. To improve the mixing performance and flashing-light effect, a novel tube PBR with the inner tube tangential to the outer tube was developed, whose radial aeration pores are situated along the length of the inner tube. The direction of aeration, aeration rate, light/dark cycle period (L/D), light-time ratio, average turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and degree of synergy between the velocity and direction of the light field in the PBR were optimized by a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation and field synergy theory.

Meanwhile, field synergy theory can be extended and applied to the design of tubular microalgae PBRs, and the average synergy of the light and velocity gradients across the cross-section increased by 38% to 0.69. The tangential inner tube aeration structure generated symmetrical vertical vortices between the light and dark areas in the PBR, which significantly improved the mixing performance and flashing-light effect. This novel design can provide a more suitable microenvironment for microalgal cultivation and is promising for bioresource recovery applications and improving the yield of microalgae.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "c5ead06098a5f40d060becb082b6ca642da32a72", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3118614490", "DOI": "10.3390/SU13020758", "CorpusId": 234184294}, "title": "Green Technological Development and Deployment in the Association of Southeast Asian Economies (ASEAN)\u2014At Crossroads or Roundabout?", "abstract": "Southeast Asia faces one of the fastest growths in electricity demand in the world, driven by increasing incomes, urbanization and industrialization.

The deployment of CCS technologies will also act as an enabler of hydrogen energy as a green energy solution in the region in the longer term. Boosting public acceptance to nuclear energy, implementing energy efficiency improvement policies and eliminating fossil fuels consumption subsidies are feasible short-term and medium-term policies.

In this study, the current market needs for high temperature heat are considered based on UK industry requirements and work carried out in other studies regarding how industrial demand could change in the future. How these heat demands could be met via different nuclear reactor systems is also presented. Using this information, it was found that the industrial heat demands for temperature in the range of 500 \u2218 C to 1000 \u2218 C are relatively low. Whilst High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors (HTGRs), Very High Temperature Reactors (VHTRs), Gas-cooled Fast Reactors (GFRs) and Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs) have an advantage in terms of capability to achieve higher temperatures (>500 \u2218 C), their relative benefit over Liquid Metal-cooled Fast Reactors (LMFRs) and Light Water Reactors (LWRs) is actually smaller than previous studies indicate. This is because, as is shown here, major parts of the heat demand could be served by almost all reactor types. Alternative (non-nuclear) means to meet industrial heat demands and the indirect application of nuclear power, in particular via producing hydrogen, are also considered.

Many countries, including the United States, wrestle with balancing economic development and meeting critical near-term environmental goals while minimizing longterm environmental risks. One promising solution to the buildup of GHGs in the atmosphere, being pursued by the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and its industrial and academic partners, is carbon sequestration\u2014a process of permanent storage of CO2 emissions in underground geologic formations, thus avoiding CO2 release to the atmosphere. This option looks particularly attractive for point source emissions of GHGs, such as fossil fuel fired power plants. CO2 would be captured, transported to a sequestration site, and injected into an appropriate geologic formation. However, sequestration in geologic formations cannot achieve a significant role in reducing GHG emissions unless it is acceptable to stakeholders, regulators, and the general public, i.e., unless the risks involved are judged to be acceptable. One tool that can be used to achieve acceptance of geologic sequestration of CO2 is risk assessment, which is a proven method to objectively manage hazards in facilities such as oil and natural gas fields, pipelines, refineries, and chemical plants. Although probabilistic risk assessment (PRA) has been applied in many areas, its application to geologic CO2 sequestration is still in its infancy. The most significant risk from geologic carbon sequestration is leakage of CO2. Two types of CO2 releases are possible\u2014 atmospheric and subsurface. High concentrations of CO2 caused by a release to the atmosphere would pose health risks to humans and animals, and any leakage of CO2 back into the atmosphere negates the effort expended to sequester the CO2. Subsurface risks, attributable to subsurface releases, arise from the displacement of fluids by the injected CO2 that could damage nearby hydrocarbon resources or trigger small seismic events. There is also the potential for sequestered CO2 to leak into non-saline formations, which could cause problems with potable uses of this water. However, overall, risks from CO2 sequestration are believed to be small. Implementation of CO2 sequestration is being approached in phases. The DOE is currently sponsoring a series of pilot tests to generate important data that will elucidate the risks involved in geologic sequestration and lead to the development of risk management protocols. This phased approach should ensure that potential sources of leakage are identified, consequences are quantified, events with the potential to cause harm are analyzed to estimate their frequency and associated risk, and safeguards are put in place to further reduce risks for an operation for which risks already appear to be low.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "e60f04661e3cff5fe84168b0bb20ba3c13824bc6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2567863744", "DOI": "10.25560/38620", "CorpusId": 113829078}, "title": "Multi-period whole system optimisation of an integrated carbon dioxide capture, transportation and storage supply chain", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "8e23e86e57eb99b480f332445ea69154e71086e9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3012294712", "DOI": "10.1201/9781351170888-5", "CorpusId": 216462065}, "title": "Pinch Analysis Techniques for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "50df2c296d92a54484708aaffaf38ed16120ad0c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3003814034", "DOI": "10.1109/PESGM40551.2019.8973559", "CorpusId": 210992396}, "title": "Look-ahead dispatch considering the integrated carbon and electricity network constraints", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage technology are becoming a promising method to mitigate the CO2 emissions from the power generation sector.

Key Points \u2022 In addition to supplying electricity, each power generation technology brings with it a different set of grid services and attributes such as \u2013 low emission power, firm capacity, inertia, frequency control, flexibility and fault current support. \u2022 The National Electricity Market (NEM) consists of 5 state based grids that are only weakly interconnected and frequently operates at a more granular level than a nationally optimised system. \u2022 The characteristics of the NEM plays a significant role in determining the value of an additional asset placed on the system. \u2022 Each state grid will have unique asset requirements to ensure reliability and its characteristic generation profile will have a material impact on the overall NEM system.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "2848d40299f02eb7cde96b734e27346faffb9447", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3143968382", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2021.103312", "CorpusId": 233546626}, "title": "Potentials of the public engagement strategy for public acceptance and social license to operate: Case study of Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage Gundih Pilot Project in Indonesia", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "36720239ab91de82368ee90905cea6049a5d9ffd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2492537340", "DOI": "10.1201/B11645-4", "CorpusId": 133379370}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) activities in China", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "1dabfa9d573088eda81fb5b9f07b44520c46a354", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2906065846", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-95126-3_4", "CorpusId": 135046970}, "title": "Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions and the Phasing-out of Coal in Germany", "abstract": "The reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in particular CO2, is a major objective of the German energiewende. There has been broad consensus on this goal for many years now\u2014in contrast to the continuing discussion over the proposed shutdown of Germany\u2019s nuclear power plants. The German government\u2019s Energy Concept 2010 already aimed at a 80\u201395% reduction of GHG by 2050 (compared to the base year 1990). In contrast to other sectors such as transport, agriculture, and heating, the electricity sector is capable of reducing CO2 emissions at relatively moderate cost through renewable energy sources. When excluding the option of carbon capture, transport and storage (CCTS) technologies, achieving ambitious climate objectives in Germany (and elsewhere) implies phasing out both hard coal and lignite. This chapter provides an overview of Germany\u2019s GHG emission reduction targets in the electricity sector and the progress achieved so far. The electricity sector has the potential to lead the way in decarbonization, provided that the appropriate regulatory framework is in place. Due to insufficient price signals that can be expected to persist for the next decade, the European Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) will not be able to achieve this objective on its own but will require support from appropriate national instruments. Section 4.2 gives an overview of Germany\u2019s GHG emission reduction targets and their relation to European targets. Section 4.3 focuses on coal-fired electricity generation and its problematic role in the German energy sector. Section 4.4 discusses the influence of the EU-ETS as well as various additional national instruments, including a CO2 emissions performance standard (EPS), a CO2 floor price, and a phase-out law. In Section 4.5, we show that a medium-term coal phase-out is compatible with resource adequacy in Germany. The resulting structural change in the affected local basins can be handled through additional schemes, thus posing no major obstacle to the phase-out of coal.

A deeper integration of renewable energy sources is also needed if we are to mitigate the large amount of greenhouse gas emitted as a result of increasing world fossil fuel energy consumption. These new power technologies bring an increased need for distributed fast dispatch power and energy storage that counteract their intermittent nature. A novel technological approach to provide fast dispatch emission free power is the use of the Argon Power Cycle, a technology that makes carbon capture an integral part of its functioning principle. The core concept behind this technology is a closed loop internal combustion engine cycle working with a monoatomic gas in concert with a membrane gas separation unit. By replacing the working fluid of internal combustion engines with a synthetic mixture of monoatomic gases and oxygen, the theoretical thermal efficiency can be increased up to 80%, more than 20% over conventional air cycles. Furthermore, the absence of nitrogen in the system prevents formation of nitrogen oxides, eliminating the need for expensive exhaust gas after-treatment and allowing for efficient use of renewable generated hydrogen fuel. In the case of hydrocarbon fuels, the closed loop nature of the cycle affords to boost the pressure and concentration of gases in the exhaust stream at no penalty to the cycle, providing the driving force to cost effective gas membrane separation of carbon dioxide. In this work we investigated the potential benefits of the Argon Power Cycle to improve upon current stationary power generation systems regarding efficiency, air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. A cooperative fuel research engine was used to carry out experiments and evaluate engine performance in relation to its air breathing counterpart. A 30% efficiency improvement was achieved and results showed a reduction on engine heat losses and an overall increase on the indicated mean effective pressure, despite the lesser oxygen content present in the working fluid. Greenhouse gas emissions were reduced as expected due to a substantial increase in efficiency and nitric oxides were eliminated as it was expected. Numerical simulation were carried out to predict the performance and energy penalty of a membrane separation unit. Energy penalties as low as 2% were obtained capturing 100% of the carbon dioxide generated.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "bcb8d44cf3c2f82db17a3d774c6cd39957fb37b7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2798089119", "DOI": "10.4337/9781783477616.I.16", "CorpusId": 133810203}, "title": "Carbon capture and storage as a bridging technology", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "f329bcf2b43fab399ee0a3b7500cd7da13dfbb92", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3081384051", "DOI": "10.1002/ente.202000398", "CorpusId": 225305333}, "title": "Incentive Programs Caused by the Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage Technology Profit's Effect: Optimal Configuration and Energy Planning of Hybrid Microgrid Involving INVELOX Turbine", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "9362caa520e5112e41f6847451350e4e59283bf7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "588221580", "CorpusId": 107008990}, "title": "The Route to Carbon and Energy Savings: Transit Efficiency in 2030 and 2050", "abstract": "This report identifies a portfolio of strategies that transit agencies can take to reduce the energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of their operations and estimates the potential impacts of those strategies in 2030 and 2050.

Internationally and more recently nationally there has been real governmental recognition of the reality of climate change. Along with this recognition comes a growing need for mitigation options. One such method that will play a significant role in the immediate future is Carbon Capture and Sequestration/Storage (CCS). CCS is the process of separating carbon dioxide (CO2) from power generation, industrial, or other source, transporting it to a location, and storing it permanently. CCS refers to the storage of CO2 in a variety of locations: geologic formations, oceans, and industrial fixation sites. This Note examines the geologic sequestration of CO2 because it is the method most likely to be used on a large scale in the United States and, importantly, is currently unregulated. Geologic sequestration is the process of injecting CO2 in geologic formations, such as oil and gas fields, deep saline formations or unmineable coal seams, in order to remove the CO2 from the atmosphere and reduce climate change. To protect both the environment and the nation, a comprehensive system of regulation, composed of general federal regulation and specific state-based regulation, should be created.

Hence, it is challenged in the new smart grid environment, where demand side responses have important roles to play to encourage conventional energy efficiency and support the integration of renewable generation. In order to accommodate this new environment, the investigations of smart tariff designs and their applications in demand side response are therefore carried out from three main aspects. In a high carbon system dominated by controllable fossil generation where energy peaks typically coincide with those of networks, smart tariffs are developed by statistically tracking dynamic energy price variation tendencies and categorising real-time prices to form time-of-use patterns that capture the most significant price variations without compromising too much accuracy in total energy revenue from customers. In a low carbon system where energy peaks and network peaks may not be in synchronism at all times, additional complications will be raised when developing smart tariffs and optimal demand side response strategies. A new concept is developed in this thesis to allow shared utilization of energy storage between customers and distributed network operators to respond to conflicting energy price and network conditions. In this work, two operation models of storage share are implemented. One is fixed share between customers and network operators regardless of network conditions, and the other is dynamic share that storage capacity utilized by network operator changes with network condition. The consequential system benefit in terms of energy cost reduction and network cost saving is evaluated and converted into per unit cost reduction in the energy bill. Addition to technical solution in the form of storage, the benefit from household demand shifting, such as shifting wet appliances, in the presence of smart tariffs is evaluated. The value of household demand shifting is quantified as an equivalent storage capacity for the investigation of complementarity between technical and social interventions.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "9b13aa02787b7f294e519f1785ef142f33ca2bdc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2587281675", "DOI": "10.5071/23rdEUBCE2015-2AO.8.2", "CorpusId": 132670120}, "title": "Air/oxy biomass combustion with carbon capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "6294a6ff710306902f3131dbefc93379b2849f17", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1487561386", "DOI": "10.2139/SSRN.1956269", "CorpusId": 166772947}, "title": "Managing Regulatory Risks from Changing Climate Policy", "abstract": "Significant business risk derives from the likelihood that the policy and legal environment with respect to climate change will change quickly, imposing costs on greenhouse gas emitters and other businesses with large carbon footprints. Advice on how to manage this kind of risk is written largely on a tabula rasa; there is precious little \"law\" on climate change, conflicting signals on where law and policy will go next, and little guidance or signals from government on what to do to prevent or prepare for climate change. This short paper discusses management of the legal and regulatory risks posed by changes in law or policy for Canadian businesses. It does so in three areas of law in which the risks appear to be the most specific: (a) Canadian federal law and policy, (b) British Columbia provincial law and policy, and (c) securities disclosures law in the United States and Canada. The most dangerous policy risk faced by Canadian businesses stems ironically from the Canadian federal government's desire to avoid imposing costs from climate policy. The problem is that in this environment of policy uncertainty, Canadian businesses will still have to make decisions on capital expenditures, and prudent decision-making may still cause them to bet on a continued lack of Canadian federal seriousness on climate policy. In fact, the current proposed regulation requiring carbon capture and storage technology for coal-fired power plants nudges them towards making a bad bet on future policy. The regulation's unambitious carbon capture target of 30% ensures that money spent on carbon capture technology will be poorly spent on technology that will quickly become obsolete.Truly prudent business planning requires Canadian businesses to anticipate a future global policy environment in which greenhouse gas reductions will be taken much more seriously and will involve a carbon price, and that foreign pressures will force Canada to follow suit. This is still an ambitious proposition for publicly-traded companies that must justify capital expenditures to investors. As a result, the Canadian federal policy of trying to insulate Canadian businesses from geo-political realities with respect to climate change enables and encourages not only greenhouse gas-emitting behavior, but also the ultimately wasteful expenditure of money on capital investments that will prove ineffective in a post-climate change economy.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "5c72bee879dc73de6dc204456d18b5134d885b2e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2483571838", "CorpusId": 100551020}, "title": "MCFC-CCS: a radical new approach, with elimination of energy penalty", "abstract": "Molten carbonate fuel cells can make use of the carbon dioxide produced in fossil fuelled power plants to generate additional power.

The symposium was organized by Prof. Ying Li at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Prof. Fanxing Li at North Carolina State University. It was the largest symposium among the twenty symposia within the Division of Energy and Fuels at the 245th ACS National Meeting & Exposition. A total of 80 invited and contributed talks were presented at the symposium. Topics included fundamentals in CO2 activation and advanced processes and materials for CO2 capture, sequestration, conversion, and utilization.\nAnthropogenic CO2 emission from fossil energy conversion is one of the major contributors to global climate change. With projected increase in global energy consumption, advanced carbon capture, sequestration, and utilization approaches need to be developed. As a first step for CO2 mitigation, carbon capture can potentially be achieved, in a cost-effective manner, through new technologies that reduce the energy consumptions for separating diluted CO2 from conventional power plant flue gas. Alternatively, smart combustion or gasification processes such as oxy-fuel or chemical-looping are capable of producing concentrated CO2 for easy capture. Successful development and deployment of these aforementioned technologies require breakthroughs in advanced materials as well as innovative reactor concepts and process schemes. Sequestration of captured CO2 into geological formations such as saline aquifers is the next important step to ensure long term storage of CO2. Besides sequestration, a number of emerging ideas have shown promise to recycle and utilize CO2 as a carbon source for clean energy carriers or chemicals, mainly through catalytic processes. While CO2 is thermodynamically stable, renewable energy sources like solar can accomplish the challenging task of CO2 conversion and utilization. For example, it has been demonstrated that nanostructured photocatalysts are capable of converting CO2 and water into C1 fuels like CO, methane or methanol under solar radiation. Extensive research efforts are underway to enhance the CO2 conversion efficiency using these novel photocatalytic processes.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "4005c9e740be9f86ee33dc0aaabfa9a72b323d77", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2896581172", "DOI": "10.23919/PICMET.2018.8481866", "CorpusId": 52932995}, "title": "Assessing Patents based on Their Structural Significance in Patent Citation Network", "abstract": "This study proposes a patent assessment method based on a patent's structural role within a patent citation network. The proposed method includes two major steps: (1) assigning a weight to each citation of the patent citation network according to its traversal count within the network, and (2) obtaining a pivotalness value for each patent by summing the weights of its citations. A patent's pivotalness value is, therefore, the patent's traversal count within the network. If a citation may be deemed as a flow of knowledge or a step of technology evolution from the cited to the citing, the pivotalness value reflects a patent's significance in knowledge dissemination or technology evolution within the field. To observe this measure, this study selects for empirical analysis patents in the field of carbon dioxide capture, storage, recovery, delivery, and regeneration and collects a total of 34,083 US utility patents issued between 1976/1/1 and 2017/3/31 by the United States Patent and Trademark Office database.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "0614c6394ba6cf06b8671f5d8c5801fcd71c7e2a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2301353643", "DOI": "10.1016/J.JCT.2016.03.026", "CorpusId": 100893740}, "title": "Thermodynamic properties of a CO2 \u2013 rich mixture (CO2 + CH3OH) in conditions of interest for carbon dioxide capture and storage technology and other applications", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "434ac46ce24b42998cc2abfe1acdccac1371d145", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2567393016", "CorpusId": 132044369}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage under the Project-Based Kyoto Mechanism", "abstract": null, "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "bb5cf0c3cd13736d21475497f1f89ad13bab5286", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1111/risa.13727", "CorpusId": 232303376, "PubMed": "33738804"}, "title": "New Methods for Evaluating Energy Infrastructure Development Risks.", "abstract": "Many energy technologies that can provide reliable, low-carbon electricity generation are confined to nations that have access to robust technical and economic capabilities, either on their own or through geopolitical alliances. Equally important, these nations maintain a degree of institutional capacity that could lower the risks associated with deploying emergent energy technologies such as advanced nuclear or carbon capture and storage. The complexity, expense, and scrutiny that come with building these facilities make them infeasible choices for most nations. This paradigm is slowly changing, as the pressing need for low-carbon electricity generation and ongoing efforts to develop modular nuclear and carbon capture technologies have opened the door for potentially wider markets, including in nations without substantial institutional capacity. Here, using advanced nuclear technologies as our testbed, we develop new methods to evaluate national readiness for deploying complex energy infrastructure. Specifically, we use Data Envelopment Analysis-a method that eliminates the need for expert judgment-to benchmark performance across nations. We find that approximately 80% of new nuclear deployment occurs in nations that are in the top two quartiles of institutional and economic performance. However, 85% of potential low-carbon electricity demand growth is in nations that are in the bottom two quartiles of performance. We offer iconic paradigms for deploying nuclear power in each of these clusters of nations if the goal is to mitigate risk. Our research helps redouble efforts by industry, regulators, and international development agencies to focus on areas where readiness is low and risk correspondingly higher.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "443dc041be27cd388cb58c458014a2510531e56f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2063524257", "DOI": "10.1016/J.EGYPRO.2011.02.618", "CorpusId": 110351508}, "title": "Assessment of carbon capture and storage opportunities: Portuguese case study", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "e4cf3dfbb1633d3f3a04b99a2163a6a562d86ae9", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 54829988}, "title": "Modeling the geochemical impact of an injection of CO2 and associated reactive impurities (SO2 and O2) into a saline reservoir", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide storage in deep geological structures is a strategic technology to mitigate climate change and to promote green development.

This paper describes numerical simulations donewith TOUGHREACT that focus on the chemical reactivity of deep reservoir rock impacted by an injection of CO2 and associated reactive impurities (mainly SO2 and O2). A simplified two-dimensional radial geo-model ofthe near wellbore domain of a saline reservoir enabled us to predictits global geochemical behavior. Two CO2:SO2ratios were studied. The results show the high reactivity of the near-well zone when ancillary gases (SO2 and O2) are co-injected with CO2, which leads to thedissolution of carbonates and the precipitation of sulfateminerals.

The capture and storage of CO2 has been therefore attracting research interests globally. CO2 injection in submarine sediments can provide a way of CO2 sequestration as solid hydrates in sediments by reacting with pore water. However, CO2 hydrate formation may occur relatively fast, resulting decreasing CO2 injectivity. In response, nitrogen (N2 ) addition has been suggested to prevent potential blockage through slower CO2 -N2 hydrate formation process. Although there have been studies to explore this technique in methane hydrate recovery, little attention is paid to CO2 storage efficiency and geomechanical responses of host marine sediments. To better understand carbon sequestration efficiency via hydrate formation and related sediment geomechanical behaviour, this study presents numerical simulations for single well injection of pure CO2 and CO2 -N2 mixture into submarine sediments. The results show that CO2 -N2 mixture injection improves the efficiency of CO2 storage while maintaining relatively small deformation, which highlights the importance of injectivity and hydrate formation rate for CO2 storage as solid hydrates in submarine sediments.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "d73d2ff9170359a29f347f0383d61352981ddb21", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3035235994", "DOI": "10.3390/en13123075", "CorpusId": 225794492}, "title": "High-Efficiency Bioenergy Carbon Capture Integrating Chemical Looping Combustion with Oxygen Uncoupling and a Large Cogeneration Plant", "abstract": "Bioenergy with CO 2 capture and storage (BECCS) is a promising negative emission technology (NET). When using sustainably produced biomass as fuel, BECCS allows the production of power and heat with negative CO 2 emissions. The main technical challenges hindering the deployment of BECCS technologies include energy penalties associated with the capture process. This work evaluates the performance of an advanced CO 2 capture technology, chemical looping with oxygen uncoupling (CLOU), in conjunction with biomass-fired combined heat and power (CHP) generation. Results from a MATLAB/Simulink reactor model were incorporated in a plant and integration model developed in a commercial process simulation software to quantify the key performance indicators of the CLOU-integrated CHP plant. Both energy and exergy analysis were conducted. The results show a remarkably low efficiency penalty of 0.7% compared to a conventional reference plant, and a high carbon capture efficiency of 97%. The low efficiency penalty is due to the high moisture and hydrogen contents of the biomass, and the separation of combustion products and excess air streams in the CLOU process; these together provide an opportunity to recover a significant amount of heat by flue gas condensation at a higher temperature level than what is possible in a conventional boiler. The condensing heat recovery yields an 18 MW generator power increase (3 MW loss in net power output) for the CLOU plant; in the reference plant with conventional boiler, the same scheme could achieve an increase of 9 MW (generator) and a decrease of 8 MW (net).", "year": 2020}]}
