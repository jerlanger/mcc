A capacity expansion and dispatch model is used to assess large-scale electricity power systems for California designed to meet policy standards while minimizing total system costs. The results of the analysis show that despite its comparatively high capital cost, including gas with carbon capture and storage (Gas-CCS) in the mix of electricity generation resources greatly reduces the cost of decarbonization for California as early as 2030 and in 2045. Without Gas-CCS, enormous capacities of solar and battery resources are needed in the future to reliably balance the load of the system throughout the entire year, which results in a highly overbuilt and expensive electricity system. Gas-CCS is able to generate electricity during the night-time and throughout times of the year when solar is not readily available, resulting in cost-effective decarbonization of the grid. In addition or as an alternative to Gas-CCS, we show that bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and direct air capture with sequestration (DAC), may also have important roles in play in decarbonizing California\u2019s electricity sector.

Several CO2 separation and capture technologies exist today to produce CO2 for commercial markets. The capture technologies may be applied before of after combustion of fossil fuel depending on the capture concept. The main options considered for the long-term storage of CO2 are underground geologic formations. These include old oil and gas fields, coal formations and saline water aquifers. Deep oceans represent large potential sink for CO2, but environmental uncertainties make it less feasible in the short term. Several demonstration projects are underway to evaluate technical, economical and environmental aspects of CO2 sequestration. The estimated total cost with current technology for CO2 sequestration ranges from 40\u201360 US$ per tonne CO2 avoided. Most of the industrial applications do not offer long-term sink of CO2, and currently the need is very small compared to the amount of emitted CO2. CO2 capture and storage is more economical when applied on a large scale. The largest CO2 emitting plants in Finland are oil refineries, coal-fired power plants and steel works. By applying CO2 capture and storage technologies 80\u201390 per cent reduction of CO2 emissions can be achieved. The costs were estimated only for the electricity sector. The CO2 capture, transportation of CO2 (1 000 km, onshore) and offshore storage would double the cost of electricity for natural gas and triple the cost for coal fired power plants compared to the current market price of electricity in Finland.

Many countries are dependent on fossil fuels for energy generation, and fossil fuels remain a vast energy resource, widely distributed around the world. Coal in particular is abundant in regions that have large existing or projected energy demand and limited alternative energy options. With an average of two coal- fired power stations being built in the developing world every week, reduction in local pollution and emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from the combustion and processing of fossil fuels will remain one of the world's biggest challenges in the years ahead. The power sector will remain the main driver of global coal demand between now and 2035 in all three scenarios. Power generation accounts, respectively, for just over 80% and around 75% of the increase in world coal demand in both the Current and New Policies Scenarios. The IEA analysis of the international coal market shows that \"for all the talk about natural gas and renewables, coal unquestionably won the energy race in the first decade of the 21st century.\" Between 2000 and 2010 primary coal demand grew by 4.4% per year, which is well above the average of 2.7% for natural gas and 1.1% for oil. In 2010, world coal demand was almost 55% higher than in 2000, which is a bigger increase in both volume and percentage terms than for any other fuel category, including renewables. India has a long history of commercial coal mining covering nearly 220 years starting from 1774 by M/s Sumner and Heatly of East India Company in the Raniganj Coalfield along the Western bank of river Damodar. However, for about a century the growth of Indian coal mining remained sluggish for want of demand but the introduction of steam locomotives in 1853 gave a fillip to it. Within a short span, production rose to an annual average of 1 million tonne (mt) and India could produce 6.12 mts. per year by 1900 and 18 mts per year by 1920. The production got a sudden boost from the First World War but went through a slump in the early thirties. The production reached a level of 29 mts. by 1942 and 30 mts. by 1946(1).

Carbon Capture and Storage technologies offer the possibility for continued use of fossil fuels while almost eliminating the CO2 emissions. Oxy-fuel combustion is a promising CO2 capture technology which can be applied to electricity generation. Oxy-fuel combustion is currently being developed for power plants with pulverized coal combustion and for plants with circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion, the latter being the focus of this thesis. The large flexibility in heat extraction that CFB combustion offers through heat extraction possibilities within and outside the furnace enables combustion at low temperature (around 850\uf0b0C) even at high inlet oxygen concentrations. This potential to operate at high O2 inlet concentrations implies a possibility for a considerable reduction in the furnace dimensions. Furthermore, the high thermal capacity of the bed particles allows combustion with a relatively even temperature profile in the unit. \nBased on experimental data and previous modeling experience from air fired CFB combustion, this work develops modeling tools for assessing oxy-fuel CFB combustion across a wide range of operational conditions. Firstly, the additional requirements of oxy-fuel CFB boilers in comparison to air-fired CFB boilers are identified by means of modeling, closing the heat balance under different oxygen inlet concentrations for a 278 MWth CFB. Second, a generic model for combustion, valid for both air- and oxy-fired CFB combustion is proposed, including heterogeneous and homogeneous reactions and accounting for axial and lateral gas and solids mixing. The model results are compared with experimental data from two oxy-fuel-fired CFB units of 100 kW and 4 MW, yielding satisfactory results. Model simulations are carried out for a broad range of CFB-furnace operational conditions, investigating the progress of combustion using CO as an indicator. \nThe model predicts that in the 278 MWth unit, heat extraction from the return leg is required at inlet O2 concentrations above 29% and the net external solids flux must increase when applying inlet O2 concentrations beyond approximately 34%. The model and experimental results imply that for similar inlet concentrations of O2 (i.e. around 21%) oxy-firing results in a higher CO peak concentration, as compared to the air-fired condition. In addition, the modeling shows that both the CO peak concentration and lateral gas mal-distribution increase with increasing O2 inlet concentration.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "f47f658eb55a2210989586b796a2cdccc9a5c1fb", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1111/wej.12692", "CorpusId": 242458377}, "title": "Editorial", "abstract": "Happy new year to all our Water and Environment Journal readers and colleagues! 2021 has been named the Year of Sustainability.

These plans need to be future proof, costeffective, consistent with local and national goals, as well as ensuring the efficiency of resources. A point that is receiving much attention is the negative emissions strategies, reliant on removing CO2 from the atmosphere, followed by storage in the ocean, ground or land. Treeplanting has been indicated as one of the strategies that many companies have pledged too, but with so many promising millions of new trees the shortage of landbank to achieve this has been recognized. On the engineered technology side, many solutions have been proposed but still not widely demonstrated (e.g., direct carbon capture from atmosphere, enhancing ocean productivity, bioengineering crops for carbon capture and storage, etc). In a recent paper published in the Water and Environment Journal, Upendar et al. (2021) described the use of microalgae as a promising sustainable green technology to capture CO2 from the atmosphere. Regardless of how industries are aiming to improve on sustainability (e.g., negative emissions, resourceuse efficiency, adoption of clean technologies, etc.), there is a very large amount of options and routes available, leaving questions on what works and what solutions should be combined or not. We need to assess sustainability using economic, environmental and social metrics and integrate them in a way that makes sense, it is aligned with current initiatives, allowing for a benchmark against others in the same industry as well as to evaluate how the industry evolves. Some tools already exist (e.g., MolinosSenante et al., 2016) but there is more we can do to improve and communicate them among a range of audiences. One of the reasons why Sustainability is a hot topic in 2021 relates to the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) that will take place in Glasgow (1\u2013 12 November 2021). This follows up from the very successful COP21\u2014 also called the Paris agreement\u2014 where many world leaders agreed with taking measures to limit average global surface temperatures to \u2018well below 2\u00b0C\u2019 above preindustrial levels and emphasizes on \u2018efforts\u2019 to limit it to 1.5\u00b0C. The COP26 conference will focus on five topics: restoring nature, adaptation and resilience, clean energy, clean transport and finance, and there is much anticipation on the outputs of this event. Following on the topic of sustainability, our Water and Environment Journal will be transitioning from print to digital and over the next few weeks. Not only will this save precious environmental resources, but it will also open up access to a searchable backlog of hundreds of additional papers. Some of you might have noticed the Volume 34 Issue S1 with over a 1000 pages that enabled us to publish all the papers that have been already accepted in previous months so we can start the online issues afresh. I hope you enjoy this issue of the Water and Environment Journal.

The efficiency evaluation shows a sustainability score, which consists of 11 indicators within three dimensions: energy, environmental, economic dimension. 4 Scenarios are studied; (1) BAU, (2) the implementation of high-efficiency equipment and energy conservation in designated factories, (3) the implementation of solar PV rooftop, and fuel switching in a boiler system, (4) the combination of scenario 2 and 3. 4 steps of the indicator scoring start from targeting, scoring, weighting, to aggregating. For Thai industry, the analysis shows that the energy score is at 78.99 in the BAU scenario and can be improved to 93.92 when implementing EEP2018 and AEDP2018 measures. Also, it suggests that the corresponding environmental score can be improved from 52.60 in BAU scenario to 80.62 in scenario 4. For BAU scenario, the economic score is shown as 55.75 and gets improved to 73.67 in scenario 4. Consequently, the sustainability score of Thai industry is summarized as 58.73. With the implementation of the EEP2018 measures, the industry can increase a score to 71.14, 21.27% higher than that of BAU. However, for scenario as an implementation of AEDP2018, it is shown that the sustainability score will decrease to 64.48. Then, the industry implements both EEP2018 and AEDP2018 measures, increasing a score to 79.86. In particular, the chemical sector can reach a perfect score of 100 in all three dimensions. This shows a great contribution to meet the national target and bring the sustainable development to the country. However, the non-metallic products sector reveals the lowest score but it can be improved by implementation of additional measures suitable for the industry such as carbon capture storage (CCS) in the cement industry, material substitution, and material efficiency, etc.", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "8910fe2a1636b1e271b9c3442bff09de379e0d2c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2999745199", "CorpusId": 211223076}, "title": "Evaluating the use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage to achieve energy transition and decarbonization", "abstract": "Energy and climate are both at the heart of societal challenges. To ensure that we remain on a compatible trajectory with the 2\u00b0C or 1.5\u00b0C boundary, the Paris Agreement requires that GHG emissions need to peak as soon as possible, so that countries must aim to achieve neutral emission in the second half of this century. The challenges of climate change involve rethinking the world\u2019s energy system and notably, the success of a large-scale energy transition could involve more responsible exploitation of fossil resources One option still presented as a solution to reach ambitious decarbonization targets is carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, particularly when associated with bioenergy resources due to the negative emission the latter allow. A growing body of literature assesses the achievement of high CO2 emission reduction targets through the deployment of CCS on an industrial scale and the combination of these technologies with the increasing use of biomass. Indeed, faced with the threat of climate change and tensions over resources (energy or water), greater use of bioenergy is considered a possible track. BECCS is increasingly invoked in integrated assessment models (IAMs) as an option that delivers negative emissions, particularly if mitigation is delayed further (Jackson et al., 2017). In the latest IPCC Assessment Report (AR5), 101 of the 116 scenarios with a limited atmospheric concentration at 430-480 ppm rely on BECCS and about 67% of these have a BECCS share in primary energy exceeding 20% in 2100 (Fuss et al., 2014). However, avoiding the required Gt of CO2 emissions by investing in CCS technologies requires developing carbon storage capacities and, when associated with bioenergy, a plausible and sustainable potential for biomass resources. little is known about the global potential of emerging and future negative emissions technologies, nor about the sustainability and cost of large-scale deployment needed to meet \"safe\" climate stabilization targets. Furthermore, avoiding the gigatonnes of CO2 emissions expected from investing in CCS technologies will require developing significant carbon storage capacities. The results of the study published by Viebahn et al. (2015) strengthen the interest of this question by showing that \u201cthe most crucial pre-condition that must be met is a reliable storage capacity assessment based on site-specific geological data\u201d.

East Natuna Basin has source rocks in coals and carbonaceous shales Gabus, Barat and Arang formations with the Gabus Formation considered the most important with Middle Miocene to Lower Pliocene Terumbu Formation as the primary reservoir. The main seal in the basin is provided by the Pliocene-Quaternary Muda Formation. The Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) or Carbon Sequestration is a relatively new concept with the first commercial example was Weyburn Field, Canada in 2003. CCS is a process of capturing waste carbon dioxidefrom large point sources, such as fossil fuel power plants, transporting it to a storage site, and depositing it where it will not enter the atmosphere, normally an underground geological formation. This methodology is one of technologies to reduce gas emission. It will be useful to be applied in field with high CO2 content. This paper will briefly discuss the potentiality of Terumbu Formation as the CO2 storage in East Natuna Basin.

Based on several investigations, reported in literature, it is observed that the storage of hydrogen in solid form is more suitable option to overcome the challenges like its storage and transportation. In this form, hydrogen can be stored by absorption (metal hydrides and complex hydrides) and adsorption (carbon materials). Compared to absorption, adsorption of hydrogen on carbon materials is observed to be more favorable in terms of storage capacity. Taking in to account of these facts, in this short review, an overview on hydrogen adsorption on activated carbon and different allotropes of carbon like graphite, carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanofibers is presented. Synthesis processes of all the carbon materials are discussed in brief along with their hydrogen storage capacities at different operating conditions, and thermodynamic properties and reaction kinetics. In addition, different methods to improve hydrogen storage capacities of carbon materials are presented in detail. Finally, comparison is made between different carbon materials to estimate the amount of hydrogen that can be stored and retract practically.

Cells in a biofilm are protected from adverse external conditions. In natural environments, this attached mode of growth is more successful than the suspended mode, and a major portion of microbial activity takes place at surfaces. In porous media, biofilms are used as bioreactors (e.g, in wastewater treatment) and as biobarriers (e.g., in enhanced oil recovery). They are also used in the containment and degradation of contaminants in groundwater aquifers. It has been proposed that biofilms be used as biobarriers for the mitigation of carbon dioxide (CO2) leakage from a geological storage reservoir. \nThe concentration of greenhouse gases -- particularly carbon dioxide (CO2) -- in the atmosphere has been on the rise in the past decades. One of the methods which have been proposed to help reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions is the capture of CO2 from large, stationary point sources and storage in deep geological formations. The caprock is an impermeable geological layer which prevents the leakage of stored CO2, and its integrity is of utmost importance for storage security. As mentioned above, biofilms could be used as biobarriers which help prevent the leakage of CO2 through the caprock in injection well vicinity. Due to the high pressure build-up during injection, the caprock in the vicinity of the well is particularly at risk of fracturing. The biofilm could also protect well cement from corrosion by CO2-rich brine. \nThe goal of this work is to develop and test a numerical model which is capable of simulating the development of a biofilm in a CO2 storage reservoir. This involves the description of the growth of the biofilm, flow and transport in the geological formation, and the interaction between the biofilm and the flow processes. Important processes which are accounted for in the model include the effect of biofilm growth on the permeability of the formation, the hazardous effect of supercritical CO2 on suspended and attached bacteria, attachment and detachment of biomass, and two-phase fluid flow processes. The partial differential equations which describe the system are discretised in space with a vertex-centered finite volume method, and an implicit Euler scheme is used for time discretisation. The model is tested by comparing simulation results to experimental data. \nIn a test case simulation, the model predicts the extent of biomass accumulation near an injection well and its effect on the permeability of the formation. The simulations show that the biobarrier is only effective for a limited amount of time. Regular injection of nutrients would be necessary to sustain the biofilm. In future work, the model could be extended to account for the active precipitation of minerals by the biofilm which would lead to a more enduring barrier. The model also needs to be extended to account for more than one growth-limiting factor. This would allow for the simulation of injection strategies which aim at growing a biofilm at some distance from the injection well. \nBiofilme, die in einem porosen Medium wachsen, blockieren Poren und verandern dabei die Eigenschaften des porosen Mediums. Diese veranderten Eigenschaften werden bei der biologischen Filtration (z. B. bei der Abwasserbehandlung), bei der biologischen Altlastensanierung (z. B. fur die Erstellung hydraulischer Barrieren) und bei anderen Fragestellungen auf diesem Gebiet genutzt. Eine hydraulische Barriere biologischen Ursprungs konnte z. B. auch in einer geologischen Kohlendioxid-Lagerstatte eingesetzt werden, um das Entweichen von CO2 zu verhindern. \nCO2 ist das derzeit fur am Wichtigsten erachtete anthropogene Treibhausgas. Die globale Erderwarmung wird demnach sehr stark durch die in den letzten Jahrzehnten stattfindende Anreicherung von anthropogenen Treibhausgasen in der Atmosphare mitverursacht. Die Freisetzung von CO2 kann mit Hilfe effizienterer Technologien und alternativer Energiequellen reduziert werden. CO2-Emissionen konnen aber auch reduziert werden, indem man CO2 aus Kraftwerksabgasen abscheidet und in tiefen geologischen Formationen speichert. Bei den physikalischen Bedingungen, die in diesen unterirdischen Lagerstatten herrschen, liegt CO2 im uberkritischen Zustand vor, gekennzeichnet durch eine hohe Dichte und geringe Viskositat. Diese Lagerstatten enthalten oft salzhaltiges Wasser, das dichter ist als CO2. Eine moglichst undurchlassige geologische Deckschicht verhindert das Aufsteigen des leichteren CO2 an die Erdoberflache. Jedoch mussen, z. B. im Rahmen von Risikostudien, mogliche Storungen oder Risse in dieser Deckschicht betrachtet werden, die zu einem Entweichen des CO2 fuhren konnten. Die Deckschicht in der Nahe eines CO2-Injektionsbrunnens ist besonders gefahrdet. Der hohe Druckanstieg wahrend der ersten Injektionsphase, Zementkorrosion am Brunnen aufgrund des CO2-reichen Formationswassers und eventuelle Beschadigungen der Deckschicht wahrend der Erstellung des Bohrlochs sind als mogliche Ursachen fur gestorte Deckschichten zu nennen. Biobarrieren konnten verwendet werden, um solche Risiken zu minimieren, z. B. indem sie Risse in der Deckschicht abdichten oder den Bohrlochzement vor Korrosion schutzen. Eine Biobarriere kann aus einem Biofilm selbst bestehen, aber auch aus vom Biofilm begungstigten mineralischen Ablagerungen. \nDie vorliegende Arbeit behandelt im Wesentlichen die Entwicklung eines numerischen Modells, um die Anreicherung von mikrobieller Biomasse im Untergrund simulieren zu konnen. Das entwickelte Modell soll in der Lage sein, das Abdichten der beschadigten geologischen Deckschicht einer unterirdischen Kohlendioxid-Lagerstatte mit Hilfe von Biofilmen zu simulieren. Dafur mussen einerseits Stromungsprozesse und andererseits auch die mikrobielle Aktivitat sowie die Interaktion dieser Vorgange in porosen Medien richtig beschrieben werden. Die Anreicherung von Bakterien in einem porosen Medium beeinflusst die hydraulischen Eigenschaften des Mediums und als Folge davon auch die darin stattfindende Stromung. Im Gegenzug bestimmt die Stromung den Transport der mikrobiellen Nahrstoffe und damit auch die Verteilung mikrobieller Wachstumsraten. Dementsprechend ist die richtige Beschreibung der Wechselwirkung zwischen Stromung und mikrobiellen Prozessen eine wesentliche Herausforderung in der Modellbildung.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "43a98b7b3684f5b31e5f4731711cba0287706c93", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "2072827", "MAG": "1989844744", "DOI": "10.1289/EHP.115-A538", "CorpusId": 27948573, "PubMed": "18007974"}, "title": "Carbon Capture & Storage: Blue-Sky Technology or Just Blowing Smoke?", "abstract": "Towering 650 feet over the sea surface and spouting an impressive burning flare, it would be easy to mistake the Sleipner West gas platform for an environmental nightmare.

Located off the Norwegian coast, it ranks among Europe\u2019s largest natural gas producers, delivering more than 12 billion cubic feet of the fuel annually to onshore terminals by pipeline.

Many experts believe this practice, dubbed carbon capture and storage (sometimes known as carbon capture and sequestration, but in either case abbreviated CCS), could be crucial for keeping industrial CO2 emissions out of the atmosphere. Sleipner injects 1 million tons of CO2 annually into the Utsira Formation, a saline aquifer big enough to store 600 years\u2019 worth of emissions from all European power plants, company representatives say. \n \nWith mounting evidence of climate change\u2014and predictions that fossil fuels could supply 80% of global energy needs indefinitely\u2014the spotlight on CCS is shining as brightly as the Sleipner flare.

(A gigaton is a billion metric tons.) There is a sturdy cover of air around our planet. This thick air-tight blanket captures the heat of the earth we find today. CO2 is the main greenhouse gas which controls the temperature of atmosphere. Since 1880, due to increasing carbon percentage in atmosphere Earth temperature is increased by 2\u00b0 Fahrenheit. If we don\u2019t change anything, the effects of climate change as forest fires, the stifling heat waves, and sea level rise will continue to become severe. Here's the big, important thing about CO2: this is a greenhouse gas. That means CO2 in the atmosphere works to trap heat near Earth. It helps the Earth to hold on to some of the energy it receives from the Sun so that all the energy that comes from it does not return to space. If it were not for the effects of global warming, the oceans would be extremely solid. Earth would not be as beautiful a planet blue and green as life. Therefore, CO2 and other greenhouse gases are good to a certain level. As increase in CO2 concentration can help plants to grow faster. But CO2 is so good at trapping heat from the Sun, that even a small increase in CO2 in the atmosphere could cause the Earth to warm up even more. Currently we\u2019re using some techniques as Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), Direct Air Capture, Carbon Mineralization, and Ocean-based Concepts. But these are not very cost effective. For instance, direct air capture costs about $94-$232 per metric ton. It\u2019s not very productive, some researchers have found the way to convert CO2 into useful fuel. The purified carbon could also be used to make methanol, carbon nanofibers, or diesel fuel. But again, fuel formed this way is expensive than naturally available resources. It can cost around $94 and $232 per metric ton. Here is the possible solution to minimize this cost in our report.

CCS is one of the key technologies essential to achieve greenhouse gas reduction. This technology can also contribute to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) efforts by increasing oil production in mature fields. The liquefied CO2 (LCO2) to be sequestered is injected directly into subseabed geological formations through a flexible riser pipe using injection facilities contained onboard an LCO2 carrier ship. The primary characteristics of this LCO2 subseabed injection system are as follows: the presence of LCO2 injection equipment onboard the LCO2 carrier ship, a direct injection into subseabed geological formations through a flexible riser pipe, and the absence of any stationary sea surface structures at the offshore CO2 injection site. The advantage of ship-based transportation is flexibility in regard to i) multiple CO2 shipping locations and storage sites, ii) multiple injection sites from a large CO2 storage port, and iii) relocation of the injection site resulting from either termination of oil production or the site becoming filled with CO2. That is, ships can easily alter their shipping ports and routes to the offshore injection site(s), depending on requirements. Introduction Ship-based Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage. Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), one of the key technologies for greenhouse gas reduction, can be accomplished by the injection of liquefied CO2 (LCO2) into geological formations, both inland and offshore in subseabeds, a method that has been studied by the petroleum industry and national organizations. The proposed ship-based LCO2 subseabed injection system described herein is characterized by the presence of LCO2 injection equipment located onboard the LCO2 carrier ship, the absence of any stationary sea surface structures at the offshore CO2 storage site, and direct LCO2 injection into subseabed geological formations through a flexible riser pipe which remains submerged on the seabed until it is pulled up and connected to the LCO2 carrier ship for the LCO2 injection. The main stages and components needed for the proposed system are the following: initial liquefaction of CO2 and temporary storage at ports, offloading to a shuttle ship equipped with a dynamic positioning system (DPS) and injection equipment, and at the injection site, a flexible riser pipe whose ends are connected with the wellhead on the seafloor and the pickup system. The use of an unmanned offshore facility for mooring and injection results in lower facility construction/maintenance costs as well as increased safety of the entire operation.

One of the most vexing issues in connection with a cap-and-trade system is the difficulty in predicting the resulting market price for CO 2 emission permits. This price would be the effective carbon tax imposed on the world\u2019s economies. Critics of cap-and-trade regulation argue that, barring technological breakthroughs, the effective carbon tax could reach levels that would severely injure all energy intensive sectors of the economy. Such predictions are too dire. In fact, we estimate substantial reductions in CO 2 emissions could be achieved at a marginal cost in the range of $25 \u2013 $30 per metric ton (\u2018tonne\u2019). The imposition of a cap-and-trade system is likely to spawn a range of alternative CO 2 abatement strategies. Among these, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) at fossil fuel power plants is not only within technological reach, but current engineering estimates also suggest that it will be a cost-effective approach for eliminating most of the emissions from coal and natural gas power plants. Since power generation currently accounts for a sizeable share of the overall \u2018emissions pie,\u2019 CCS is bound to have a major role in limiting the effective carbon tax under a capand-trade system.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is not seeing the necessary rates of investment into full-scale demonstration projects and nearly one- half of new coal-fired power plants are still being built with inefficient technology. The power generation sector is expected to contribute more than one-third of potential CO2 emissions reductions worldwide by 2020 under the 2DS, and almost 40% of 2050 emission reduction.

I. INTRODUCTION he Indian power sector is growing at a rapid pace and coal is, and will continue to be, the primary energy source for the Indian power sector that underpins the country's economic development. About 68% of India's current power generation is from coal and that share is expected to remain in the same range for many years. A significant percentage of India's existing coal-fired power plants are aging and are no longer very efficient and reliable, especially those operated by state utilities. In recent years, India power generators have focused on increasing plant load factors (PLF, or capacity factors) to increase electricity output, but often at the expense of plant efficiency. Heat rates (i.e., fuel consumption per unit of electricity generated) higher than 3,000 kcal/kWh (i.e., efficiencies lower than about 28%) are common among the older, especially smaller (100-200 megawatt, MW) units operated by many Indian state utilities. Plant reliability and efficiency suffer as a result of: 1. The high-ash content of most Indian coals, which often exceeds 45%, and overall poor coal quality. 2. Limited maintenance of equipment. 3. Absence of incentives to maintain or improve efficiency and reliability. 4.

Applications of interest include monitoring carbon capture and storage and hydraulic fracturing operations. Also of interest is detecting flaws or breaks in degrading steel-casings\u2014such wells pose serious environmental hazards. The general principles of electrical methods with steel-cased wells are understood and several authors have demonstrated that the presence of steel-cased wells can be beneficial for detecting signal due to targets at depth. However, the success of a direct current (DC) resistivity survey lies in the details. Secondary signals might only be a few per cent of the primary signal. In designing a survey, the geometry of the source and receivers, and whether the source is at the top of the casing, inside of it, or beneath the casing will impact measured responses. Also the physical properties and geometry of the background geology, target and casing will have a large impact on the measured data. Because of the small values of the diagnostic signals, it is important to understand the detailed physics of the problem and also to be able to carry out accurate simulations. This latter task is computationally challenging because of the extreme geometry of the wells, which extend kilometers in depth but have millimeter variations in the radial direction, and the extreme variation in the electrical conductivity which is typically 5\u20137 orders of magnitude larger than that of the background geology.\n In this paper, we adopt a cylindrical discretization for numerical simulations to investigate three important aspects of DC resistivity in settings with steel-cased wells. (1) We examine the feasibility of using a surface-based DC resistivity survey for diagnosing impairments along a well in a casing integrity experiment. This parameter study demonstrates the impact of the background conductivity, the conductivity of the casing, the depth of the flaw, and the proportion of the casing circumference that is compromised on amplitude of the secondary electric fields measured at the surface. (2) Next, we consider elements of survey design for exciting a conductive or resistive target at depth. We show that conductive targets generate stronger secondary responses than resistive targets, and that having an electrical connection between the target and well can significantly increase the measured secondary responses. (3) Finally, we examine common strategies for approximating the fine-scale structure of a steel cased well with a coarse-scale representation to reduce computational load. We show that for DC resistivity experiments, the product of the conductivity and the cross-sectional area of the casing is the important quantity for controlling the distribution of currents and charges along its length.\n To promote insight into the physics, we present results by plotting the currents, charges, and electric fields in each of the scenarios examined.

In particular, Bio-Energy technologies linked to technologies for CO2 Capture and Storage (BECS) or to other carbon disposal technologies, if done on a sufficiently large scale, can achieve this result given a context of policy urgency that also yields advances in energy efficiency and the take up of ambient energy technologies (wind, solar, etc.) in line with low emissions energy scenarios (e.g. the fossil free energy scenario developed by the Tellus Institute for Greenpeace International (Lazarus et al. 1993). It has also been shown (Read 1999, 2000, 2000a) that, if account is taken of inter-temporal beneficial learning externalities, it is efficient to reward innovation in policy-desirable technology types (e.g. through project-based schemes that embody such technology types) by a greater amount than the penalty on emissions. Such dynamic efficiency can be achieved through establishing a secondary market for project based credits exchanged for a number of emissions permits M(t) (M > 1 for t < H, the time horizon for policy) and with the variation of M(t) over time corresponding to the dynamically efficient path. This results in the incentive for project based emissions reductions being M(t) times greater than the penalty on emissions. By making use of the initial allocation of permits in each time period, an aspect of emissions permit trading that has no efficiency function under either auctioning or \u2018grand-fathering\u2019, this arrangement enables project based credits to be administered flexibly whilst ensuring the integrity of the emissions cap. The purpose of this article is to link these two bodies of work to show how a dynamically efficient response to the threat of abrupt climate change can be implemented in a way that is compatible with the response to gradual climate change that has been negotiated in the Kyoto Protocol. The design of such a dynamically efficient mechanism is considered, having as its objective the promotion of the two technology types mentioned above. A particular institutional model for implementing such a mechanism is described that mimics managerial behaviour in the adoption of new technology, avoids the additionality requirement that burdens the operation of the CDM in its current form, and aims to achieve \u2018industry friendliness\u2019 as a necessary condition of effective implementation.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "305d909ad0b1682b3f7d4730b3e4ae6b1316a738", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2788240438", "CorpusId": 134151692}, "title": "CUBIERTAS FORESTALES Y ESCENARIOS DE CARBONO EN EL ESTADO DE M\u00c9XICO, 2002-2010", "abstract": "El estudio analiza escenarios de captura y emision de carbono en las cubiertas forestales del Estado de Mexico.

At present, flue gases exhausted from coal-fired plant must be separated to extract pure CO 2 before injecting it into coal seams. In order to enhance the efficiency of carbon capture and storage (CCS) from a coal-fired power plant, oxy-fuel combustion technology has been employed. This technology uses pure oxygen to burn the coal, and consequently CO 2 concentration in the flue gas is theoretically increased up to 95%. This study aims to simulate the CH 4 replacement mechanism in coal by using pure CO 2 and a synthesized flue gas (99% CO 2 and 1% SO 2 ) that is similar to the emission gas from the coal-fired power plants. A measurement procedure for gas adsorption is employed which, after establishing methane adsorption equilibrium of the coal samples, injects pure CO 2 or the synthesized flue gas into an adsorption cell in order to investigate CH 4 replacement properties. Coal samples used for the present experiments were taken from the coal seams of Vietnam, Japan, Australia, China and Indonesia. The samples were crushed to particle sizes ranging from 250 \u03bcm to 5 mm. The concentration of gases was taken from the adsorption cell and analyzed by using a gas chromatograph.

The project is supported under the US Department of Energy\u2019s Carbon Storage Assurance Facility Enterprise (CarbonSAFE) program. The IMSCS-HUB will collect 15 million metric tonnes (MT) per year or more in Iowa and Nebraska and transport it to saline and CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) storage sites in western Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas. Sources include multiple ethanol plants (approximately 1.8 MT/Year), coal fired electric plants (approximately 12.6 MT/Year), and natural gas fired electric plants (approximately 0.6 MT/Year). The passage of an updated tax credit for storage in February 2018 provides a strong economic driver for all of the sources in the hub to develop a hub project. The tax credit provides approximately $50/T for CO2 stored in saline storage units and $35/T for CO2 stored as part of CO2-EOR production. In addition, the inclusion of many bio-energy sources such as ethanol plants allows for early implementation of the project by taking advantage of inexpensive capture ($10/MT to $12/MT) and subsidies from California\u2019s Low Carbon Fuel Standard program. Capture cost estimates for the electric utilities is approximately $33/MT. Transport costs range from $0.6/MT to $5.40/MT. Storage costs range from $3/MT to $4/MT. The hub partners include Battelle, Advanced Resources International, Archer Daniels Midland, Nebraska Public Power District, and others. \n \nThe region of the project stretching from eastern Iowa to southwestern Nebraska acts as a source corridor, where sources add CO2 to the transport network. The transportation network will consist of a common carrier trunk line designed to connect the largest sources. Smaller sources will be connected through spur lines. The final routing will be selected using the location of existing rights away and environmental factors such as resource locations the critical species habitats. SimCCS and other tools will be used to finalize the routes. \n \nThe region of the project from southwestern Nebraska to southwest Kansas in a storage corridor where CO2 may be stored in either saline projects or CO2-EOR projects. South of Kansas the CO2 will be transported to Texas for utilization in CO2-EOR. Two saline storage sites and two EOR opportunities have been identified as anchor projects for the storage corridor. The anchor sites are at the northern and southern sides of the storage corridor and will act to validate the storage potential of the entire corridor. In Nebraska saline storage is being planned in Perkins county and CO2-EOR is being studied at Sleepy Hollow Field in Red Willow county. In Kansas, saline storage and CO2- EOR are being planned for Patterson-Heinitz-Hartland (Patterson) Field in Kearney County. Multiple storage formations occur vertically at each site allowing for stacked storage minimizing the surface footprint for monitoring and maximizes the use of storage resources at each site. \nData from new tests wells or seismic surveys for each of the sites has been used to create detailed geologic and reservoir models. Modeling for each of the anchor saline sites indicates at least a 50 million tonne storage capacity. The CO2-EOR projects are expected to utilize 2.2 MT and 3.9 MT of CO2 and produce 4.3 and 9.8 million barrels of oil for Sleepy Hollow and Patterson Fields, respectively. The inclusion of CO2-EOR along with saline storage adds an additional economic driver for the project with an estimated revenue of $128/MT and $154/MT of CO2 utilized. \nThe results of the first two phases of the project demonstrate the feasibility of the midcontinent hub concept that couples a diverse set of redundant sources to multiple saline and CO2-EOR projects. The results show that the economics and geology are favorable for early implementation of commercial scale CCUS. The existence of low carbon fuel standard subsidies, storage tax credits, and revenue from produced oil act as economic drivers to support the hub in addition to the climate benefit gained by storing CO2 the hub supports local agriculture and oil production helping to create public support. \n \nThis presentation will discuss the project development and project economics and how they relate to both stacked saline storage and CO2-EOR in the development of a storage hub. The development of a hub project allows the transport of CO2 from areas such as Iowa that have poor storage potential to areas such as western Nebraska, Kansas, and Texas that have high storage potential. This is critical to the implementation of CCUS in the midcontinent US. The presentation will also discuss the advantage of including redundant sources and sinks to develop a CO2 market that can sustain itself as a commercial enterprise after government funding ends.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "96361285f494225096b3ab61a77aca8f5041f11a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2621947416", "DOI": "10.33332/JGSM.GEOLOGI.16.1.15-21", "CorpusId": 199660617}, "title": "PROSPEK CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE (CCS) CEKUNGAN LUWUK-BANGGAI DARI SUDUT PANDANG GEOLOGI", "abstract": "Berdasarkan data kegempaan, daerah Cekungan Luwuk-Banggai kurang prospek terhadap pembangunan konstruksi carbon capture and storage (CCS).

CCS can be used for large point source emissions of\nCO2, like power plants using fossil fuels, where it removes CO2 from the flue gases.\nThis is most commonly done through the use of chemical absorption of CO2 in an\namine solvent called monoethanoloamine (MEA). After the absorption the solvent\nis regenerated and the captured CO2 is released in a stripping column, a process\nwhich is both expensive and energy consuming. The energy used for the regeneration\nreduces the output from the power plants imposing an energy penalty of up\nto almost 30%. Reducing the energy requirement in the carbon capture process is\ncrucial in order to make CCS commercially viable, and one possible way to do this\nis to use so-called phase changing solvents. This new family of molecules are amines\nthat in the presence of water and CO2 exhibit a triple phase vapour-liquid-liquid\nequilibrium. The liquid mixture separates into two liquid phases where one has a\nhigh CO2 and amine content while the other phase consists mainly of water. The\ntwo liquids can be separated without the addition of energy in a decanter so that\nonly a part of the flow is sent to the stripper. This opens up new possibilities for the\ndesign of absorption/desorption flowsheets for solvent based CCS that may reduce\nthe total energy requirement of the process. Creating flowsheets that can be used\nfor future reference and identifying important aspects and challenges of simulating\nCCS processes with phase-changing solvents is of importance. Apart from this the\naim of this project is to achieve a regeneration energy requirement below 2.0 GJ/-\ntonne CO2 captured and reduce the operating cost by 80% compared to an MEA\nreference process.\nThe project consisted of three parts where the first part was a literature study\nto identify and select solvents that exhibit the desired phase changing properties\nfollowed by property estimation of these solvents in Aspen Plus\u00ae. The estimated\nproperties were also validated using reference values. Secondly, different flowsheets\nwere created identifying different layout possibilities and a sensitivity analysis was\nperformed investigating the impact of the biggest uncertainties in assumptions made\nas well as differences in operating conditions. The third part was an economic and\nenvironmental assessment of the process and a comparison with an MEA reference\nprocess.\nIn a previous study ten potential phase changing solvents, referred to as D1-D10,\nhad been identified. From this list the solvents that were chosen for this project\nv\nwere (3-[1-(dimethylamino)propan-2-yl]aminopropyl)dimethylamine, called D6, and\n2-[2-(methylamino)ethyl]aminoethan-1-ol, called D9, based on their phase equilibrium.\nOf these two solvents, D9 overall showed the most promising results. A base\ncase flowsheet layout and two different variations were considered, where both variations\nreduced the energy demand compared to the base case. Flowsheet Layout 1\nwhere the decanter placement was changed from after to before the heat exchangers\nshowed the largest decrease in energy consumption. The best result was thus\nobtained from D9 using Layout 1 which has an operating cost of 30.10 EUR/tCO2\ncaptured, a reduction of over 37% compared to the MEA process. The regeneration\nenergy demand for this process was 1.46 GJ/tCO2 captured, which is well below\nthe target. The three environmental indicators used (Cumulative Energy Demand,\nGlobal Warming Potential and ReCiPe) all point to the processes using D9 being\nmore environmentally friendly than MEA. The results for D6 are not as promising\nas for D9, which is mostly due to the high reboiler duty of the D6 processes.\nWhen using flowsheet Layout 1 the reboiler duty is decreased also for D6 bringing\nall environmental metrics to levels lower than for MEA, although not as low as D9.\nHowever the operating cost is still high which is due to the high price of D6 offsetting\nthe benefits of reduced heat demand.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "3b55fce3ab61f78ee411b5d9a467a6472e9789f8", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.20944/preprints202011.0028.v1", "CorpusId": 228835897}, "title": "Pore Pressure Analysis for Distinguishing Earthquakes Induced by CO2 Injection from Natural Earthquakes", "abstract": "It is important to distinguish between natural earthquakes and those induced by CO2 injection at carbon capture and storage sites.

Here we simulated changes of pore pressure during CO2 injection at the Nagaoka site and compared them with estimated natural seasonal fluctuations of pore pressure due to rainfall and snowmelt as well as estimated pore pressure increases related to remote earthquakes. We clearly distinguished changes of pore pressure due to CO2 injection from those due to rainfall and snowmelt. The simulated local increase in pore pressure at seismogenic fault area was much less than the seasonal fluctuations related to precipitation and increases caused by remote earthquakes, and the lateral extent of pore pressure increase was insufficient to influence seismogenic faults. We also demonstrated that pore pressure changes due to distant earthquakes are capable of triggering slip on seismogenic faults.

Formation water (TDS = 5,390 mg/L) enriched with CO2 flowed through two types of Pennsylvanian Morrow B Sandstone: an ankerite\u2010siderite\u2010cemented sandstone (disseminated cement texture) and a calcite\u2010cemented sandstone (poikilotopic cement texture). The experiments produced little change in permeability in the ankerite\u2010siderite\u2010cemented sandstone, but permeability increased up to more than 1 order of magnitude in the calcite\u2010cemented sandstone. Ultrasonic measurements and cylinder\u2010splitting tests (also known as Brazilian tests) suggested negligible mechanical degradation of the ankerite\u2010siderite\u2010cemented sandstone.

Thus, dissolution of the disseminated ankerite\u2010siderite cement (0.28\u20130.30%) had minimal impact on modifying the flow network and the mechanical integrity of the sandstone, whereas dissolution of the poikilotopic calcite cement (0.89\u20131.13%, quantified with fluid chemistry and visualized with X\u2010ray microcomputed tomography) impacted the mechanical strength of the sandstone by disconnecting framework grains.

We develop a cooperative game-theoretic approach to: (i) examine the conditions needed for its construction to be decided, and (ii) determine the break-even CO2 value needed to build such a shared infrastructure. In particular, we highlight that, as biogenic emissions are overlooked in currently-implemented carbon accounting frameworks, BECCS and CCS emitters face asymmetric conditions for joining a shared infrastructure. We thus further examine the influence of these carbon accounting considerations by assessing and comparing the break-even CO2 values obtained under alternative accounting rules. We apply this modeling framework to a large contemporary BECCS/CCS case-study in Sweden. Our results indicate that sustainable and incentive-compatible cooperation schemes can be implemented if the value of CO2 is high enough and show how that value varies depending on the carbon accounting framework retained for negative emissions and the nature of the infrastructure operators. In the most advantageous scenario, the CO2 value needs to reach 112\u20ac/tCO2, while the current Swedish carbon tax amounts to 110\u20ac/tCO2. Overall, these findings position pragmatic policy recommendations for local BECCS deployment.

However, even that may not be sufficient, with many scientists now warning that it will likely also be necessary to reduce the existing atmospheric carbon dioxide load. That could be achieved using negative emissions technologies that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store or utilize it in some way. One promising technology is direct air capture (\u201cDAC\u201d) which uses liquid chemical solutions or solid sorbent filters to capture carbon dioxide from the air and concentrate it into a pure stream. \n \nCurrent DAC technologies are highly energy intensive and must be powered by renewable energy sources to achieve negative emissions.

From the fourth IPCC assessment (Alley et al. 2007) and the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA 2004), we now know that the deep oceans have accumulated 22 times more heat than has the atmosphere, ice melt is accelerating, wind patterns are shifting (that\u2019s particularly ominous), and nonlinear surprises are very likely in store for the climate system and for the impacts on systems such as forests and coral reefs (Epstein and Mills 2005; Stern 2006). The implications for public health and well-being are daunting, as illustrated in articles throughout this month\u2019s Environews section. \n \nWith weather turbulence turning heads on Wall Street, an emerging evangelical voice calling for \u201ccreation care,\u201d the specter of \u201cpeak oil,\u201d and a barrage of energy bills mounting Capitol Hill (the U.S. Congress), we appear to be on the verge of really taking the first steps toward confronting our energy budget. The goal of stabilizing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases requires a 60\u201380% reduction of emissions over the coming few decades. \n \nWhat follows are some considerations for crafting a comprehensive plan and some financial and policy instruments for implementation. Comparing life-cycle costs\u2014the health, ecologic, and economic dimension\u2014of proposed solutions can help differentiate safe solutions from those warranting further study, and from those with risks prohibiting wide-scale adoption. Solutions meeting multiple goals merit high ratings. \n \nEnergy conservation (demand side management) is clearly the first place to start. \u201cSmart\u201d urban growth; a smart grid (with optimizing meters and switches); hybrid vehicles; heat capture from utilities or \u201ccogeneration\u201d (two-thirds of produced energy is lost as heat); \u201cgreen buildings\u201d; and walking, biking, and improving public transport can get us halfway there\u2014and save money. \n \nDistributed generation (DG)\u2014power produced near the point of use\u2014with solar, wind, wave, geothermal heat pumps, and fuel cells can be fed into grids where they exist and, via \u201cnet metering\u201d regulations, generate income for the individual producer. Where energy is scarce and grids are few, stand-alone systems\u2014augmented with human power and stored in improved batteries\u2014can pump water, irrigate fields, power clinics, light homes, cook food, and drive development. Clean DG also improves resilience in the face of more weather extremes (i.e., adaptation to climate change), reduces carbon emissions (i.e., prevention or mitigation of climate change), stimulates green industries, and creates jobs. \n \nBiofuels hold a great deal of promise. However, converting corn to ethanol means less corn for animals and us, and may yield no net energy gain. Sugar ferments without adding energy (yeast suffices). But large plantations can deplete soils and groundwater and, in the Amazon, sugar for alcohol is pushing land clearing for soybean production deeper into the rainforest. In Indonesia, monoculture plantations of trees that produce palm oil are transforming and degrading vast swaths of prime forest, setting the stage for spreading fires and releasing biologically stored carbon from trees and peat. Cellulosic conversion of range grasses by microbe-generated enzymes may work, but land considerations still hold; recycling farm waste and garbage may yield the best results overall. \n \nBuilding green buildings with healthy surroundings will create a critical syzygy, aligning clean energy production with sustainable forestry (e.g., bamboo) and green chemistry (which avoids petrolbased carcinogens in the manufacture of carpets, paints, furniture, fertilizers, and pesticides). \n \nWhile it is unrealistic to think we can meet all of our energy needs without some fossil fuel use, natural gas is the cleanest burning and may be the best back-up source during the transition. Also, hydrogen gas (H2) can be separated from natural gas or methane (CH4) to use in fuel cells. \n \nTo implement such changes in our energy use, distribution, storage, and generation, corporations can change their products and practices (and many large ones, such as GE and Alcoa, have begun doing so). Financial institutions (e.g., bankers, insurers, managers of mutual and state pension funds) often have the longest time-line perspectives. Finance can be thought of as the central nervous system of the global economy: It is feeling the pain of huge losses from weather extremes, with insured losses rising from $400 million a year in the 1980s to $83 billion in 2005 (Epstein and Mills 2005), and they are cogitating on their response. Enlightened, self-interested actions of investors and insurers\u2014through requirements for loans, influence on building codes, and reduced premiums for proactive directors and officers of firms, for example\u2014could ripple through the entire global economy. \n \nGovernments must provide the incentives and create the infrastructure for the new economy. Credits for \u201cclean tech\u201d industries, progressive procurement practices (e.g., for hybrid fleets), and tax benefits for commercial models that defray upfront capital costs are among the incentives needed to launch infant industries and drive market shifts. Aligning rules, regulations, and rewards\u2014and dismantling the enormous financial and bureaucratic disincentives\u2014can help erect the necessary scaffolding for the low carbon economy. \n \nFinally, the United States must sign the Kyoto Protocol (United Nations 1998). Under its umbrella, we can help create a substantive global fund for adaptation and mitigation that can make the clean energy transition a \u201cwin\u2013win\u2013win\u201d for energy, the environment, and the global economy.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "df68a810e1e195d1a27f33007d48fbe3f42698e2", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 244486902}, "title": "USE OF FULL OXY-FUEL COMBUSTION AND ACCELERATED CARBONATION CURING FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IN CONCRETE MANUFACTURING", "abstract": "USE OF FULL OXY-FUEL COMBUSTION AND ACCELERATED CARBONATION CURING FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IN CONCRETE MANUFACTURING        Technical Thesis In CHE 4476 Presented to The Faculty of the University of Virginia Professor Anderson  In Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree Bachelor of Science in Chemical Engineering  Nirasha Abeysekera, Camille Cooper, Sarah Gill, David Reed  April 22, 2021", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "7253fb260891294bbec7eb75d3b9438a44d63b8b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3088593083", "DOI": "10.12972/ksmer.2016.53.5.511", "CorpusId": 238489478}, "title": "CO2 Monitoring in Stage 2C of CO2CRC Otway Project", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is recognized as a key technology that can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel combustion.

The discrepancies between literature data are attributed to metastable phases present in the equilibrium cells, as the data is usually taken in the carbon dioxide near critical region, close to carbon dioxide's dew point, and near the hydrate phase transition. For these reasons, it is important to observe and qualify all phases in the cell, as was done in this novel study with in situ Raman spectroscopy coupled to Midstream on a chip, to ensure accurate water content of the carbon dioxide fluid phase is being measured.", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "0cc94a10b92bd91b6bb4d07edbb0c24d19edd363", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2529733878", "CorpusId": 133282367}, "title": "Potential for terrestrial disposal of carbon dioxide in the U.S.", "abstract": "Many scientists are concerned about the possibility of global climate change of the continuing buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Capture and permanent disposal of carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2}) would help alleviate this potential problem. Abandoned oil and natural gas reservoirs and deep aquifers were investigated as potential disposal sites for CO{sub 2}. Currently abandoned oil and gas reservoirs could hold approximately 2.9 Gt of CO{sub 2}. Since the annual CO{sub 2} emissions from utility power plants is 2 Gt, these reservoirs would be filled in less than 1.5 years. The volume corresponding to ultimate reserves of oil and gas would hold roughly 100 Gt of CO{sub 2}. Therefore, the ultimate capacity for CO{sub 2} storage is approximately 50 years. Over half of the CO{sub 2} is emitted east of the Mississippi River, and most of the potential disposal sites are west of the Mississippi. Because of the high cost of transporting CO{sub 2} by pipeline over long distances, only a small fraction of the reservoir capacity would be useful. The capacity of deep aquifers for CO{sub 2} disposal is highly uncertain. A rough estimate for the US, derived from global estimates, is 5--500 Gt of CO{sub 2}.
