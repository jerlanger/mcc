Potato tubers are natural carbon reserves in the form of starch that have evolved to allow propagation and survival over winter. They form from stolons, below ground, where they are protected from adverse environmental conditions and animal foraging. We show that BRANCHED1b (BRC1b) acts as a tuberization repressor in aerial axillary buds, which prevents buds from competing in sink strength with stolons. BRC1b loss of function leads to ectopic production of aerial tubers and reduced underground tuberization. In aerial axillary buds, BRC1b promotes dormancy, abscisic acid responses and a reduced number of plasmodesmata. This limits sucrose accumulation and access of the tuberigen protein SP6A. BRC1b also directly interacts with SP6A and blocks its tuber-inducing activity in aerial nodes. Altogether, these actions help promote tuberization underground.", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "97f3b668fedb8f3830ce21d47f75c93a6140f90c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2737917159", "CorpusId": 102625243}, "title": "Thermodynamic properties for dissolution of CO2 in aqueous amine solutions", "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a solid option for CO 2 mitigation in the atmosphere.

Cities have become increasingly interested in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing carbon sequestration and storage in urban vegetation and soil as part of their climate mitigation actions. However, most of our knowledge on biogenic carbon cycle is based on data and models from forested ecosystems even though urban nature and microclimate are very different to those in natural or forested ecosystems. There is a need for modelling tools that can correctly consider temporal variations of urban carbon cycle and take the urban specific conditions into account. The main aims of this study are to examine the carbon sequestration potential of two commonly used street tree species (Tilia x vulgaris and Alnus glutinosa) and their soils by taking into account the complexity of urban conditions, and evaluate urban land surface model SUEWS and soil carbon model Yasso15 in simulating carbon sequestration of these street tree plantings at different temporal scales (diurnal, monthly and annual). SUEWS provides the urban microclimate, and photosynthesis and respiration of street trees whereas the soil carbon storage is estimated with Yasso. Both models were run for 2002\u20132016 and within this period the model performances were evaluated against transpiration estimated from sap flow, soil carbon content and soil moisture measurements from two street tree sites located in Helsinki, Finland. The models were able to capture the variability in urban carbon cycle due to changes in environmental conditions and tree species. SUEWS simulated the stomatal control and transpiration well (RMSE\u2009<\u20090.31\u2009mm\u2009h\u22121) and was able to produce correct soil moisture in the street soil (nRMSE\u2009<\u20090.23). Yasso was able to simulate the strong decline in initial carbon content but later overestimated respiration and thus underestimated carbon stock slightly (MBE\u2009>\u2009\u22125.42\u2009kg\u2009C\u2009m\u22122). Over the study period, soil respiration dominated the carbon exchange over carbon sequestration, due to the high initial carbon loss from the soil after the street construction. However, the street tree plantings turned into a modest sink of carbon from the atmosphere on annual scale as the tree and soil respiration approximately balanced photosynthesis. The compensation point when street trees plantings turned from annual source to sink was reached faster by Alnus trees after 12\u2009years, while by Tilia trees after 14\u2009years.

The InVEST Carbon Storage and Carbon Sequestration Model which integrates land cover maps, carbon pools, and economic value of carbon in currency units was used to quantify the amount of carbon sequestered after restoration and its economic value. The six restoration scenarios were established by tracing two corridors (1 and 2) in three different widths: 60m, 90m and 120m along waterways. With a higher number of pixels converted into forest due to the region\u2019s land use map and carbon density pool, the proposed corridor 1 derived scenarios restored a larger area than their corridor 2 counterparts and also presented higher values as results when looking at carbon sequestration and financial return (economic value).

Considering its limitations (such as the assumption that the amount of carbon will only change if there is a change in land use class) the InVEST Carbon Model showed itself to be a reliable to tool to quantify carbon sequestration and its economic value.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that global average CO2 concentration was 405 ppm in 2017, the highest concentration recorded in over 800,000 years. As chemical engineers, we are actively engaged in understanding the relationship between energy generation and atmospheric CO2 and seeking new ways to generate energy that do not produce CO2. In addition to developing these new alternative energy technologies, we are also engaged in removing CO2 from the effluent stream, thereby reducing the impact of burning fossil fuels or \u201ccapturing\u201d carbon when biofuels are consumed. Likewise, engineers are actively working on technologies that can remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Once the CO2 is obtained, it is important that it be utilized or stored so that it is not returned to the atmosphere or not added to the growing carbon stock already present. Sequestration techniques require the capture and storage of CO2, which means better understanding of the adsorption processes and the development of new sorbents that can achieve higher capture rates. Beyond that, CO2 can be used as a raw material from which chemicals can be produced, reducing the consumption of new fossil resources while simultaneously taking this greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. This issue was developed in part to expand on the current global conversation around climate change and the impact of emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The recent actions taken during COP 24 in Poland, although not as substantial as most would have liked, demonstrate the global objective to place limits on our carbon emissions, and scientists across the world are seeking new technical solutions that can guide policymakers on viable choices. Several of the manuscripts included in this special section can speak directly to those needs and opportunities. The current issue includes a compilation of recent submissions to Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy that investigates many facets of the CO2 challenge. In addition to the concerns expressed through the classical discussion of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), we evaluate both the relationship between carbon emissions and climate change and the use of policy to modify industrial behavior, as well as the impacts of bioenergy and other sources from a life cycle approach. The special section begins with a review article describing the driving forces for climate change, and in particular looks at opportunities for mitigation. The following five contributions provide further description of the use of policy to modify behavior and the relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth. These papers provide an excellent discussion on the relationship, or more precisely, the lack of correlation between economic benefit and carbon emissions, leading to recognition that the development of smart restriction on emissions will not necessarily impact the economic success of either a business or the nation, and by extension, provides a roadmap for environmentally friendly economic prosperity. In the next six contributions, authors address the issues of CCUS. In the first of these papers, the development of new sorbent materials and the analysis of their performance for CO2 capture are described. Following is a series of papers that consider new ways in which CO2 can be converted to chemicals or fuels through catalytic means. Thermodynamic analysis describes the preferred conditions under which CO2 can potentially be converted to desired products, taking this resource from the atmosphere and making it a viable feedstock. Finally, one contribution discusses CO2 storage in biological systems, which has the added advantage of providing a viable pathway for the production of useful products. The last section comprises five contributions that describe alternatives to traditional fossil fuel combustion and explores life cycle issues associated with these energy resources. Ranging from a discussion of energy diversification to a detailed analysis of two alternative energy strategies, this section considers a variety of options that can be explored as we transition to a low carbon future. Overall, this special section encompasses much of the current thinking related to the reduction of carbon emissions, the utilization of CO2 that can ameliorate its presence and provide useful products, and storage options. The discussions around the relationship between CO2 emissions, alternate energy choices, and economic growth suggest a path forward that should be of interest to all readers, but should be especially useful in working to develop long-term strategies in keeping with the suggestions of the COP 24 outcomes. Although not a comprehensive review, this special section provides a valuable starting point for those needing to better understand the current state of the art.

Several field cases have shown an increase in water injectivity during CO2 Water-Alternating-Gas (WAG) projects. Although there is consensus that the rock-fluid interaction is the main mechanism, modeling this process is still challenging. Our main goal is to validate a physically based model on experimental observations and use the validated model to predict CO2 injectivity alteration based on geochemical reactions in carbonate rocks.\n In this paper, we present a new method for CO2 reactive transport in porous media and its impact on injectivity. We hypothesize that if CO2 solubilizes in the connate water, then it induces a shift in chemical equilibrium that stimulates mineral dissolution. Consequently, porosity and permeability will increase, and cause alterations to well injectivity. We develop a predictive model to capture this phenomenon and validate the model against available data in the literature. We use UTCOMP-IPhreeqc, which is a fully coupled fluid-flow and geochemical simulator to account for rock/hydrocarbon/water interactions. In addition, we perform several experiments to test CO2/water slug sizes, mineralogy assembly, injected brine composition, and gravity segregation combined with the effect of heterogeneity.\n Coreflood simulations using chemical equilibrium and kinetics indicate mineral dissolution at reservoir conditions. The results suggest that the intensity of rock dissolution depends on formation mineralogy and brine composition as carbonate systems work as buffers. Additionally, we show that prolonged CO2 and brine injection induces petrophysical alteration close to the injection region. Our field-scale heterogeneous reservoir simulations show that permeability alteration calculated based on Carman-Kozeny correlation and wormhole formulation had the same results. Furthermore, we observed that water injectivity increased by almost 20% during subsequent cycles of CO2-WAG. This finding is also supported by the Pre-Salt carbonate field data available in the literature. In the case of continuous CO2 injection, the carbonate dissolution was considerably less severe in comparison with WAG cases, but injectivity increased due to unfavorable CO2 mobility. With the inclusion of gravity segregation, we report that the injectivity doubles in magnitude. The simulations show more extensive dissolution at the upper layers of the reservoir, suggesting that preferential paths are the main cause of this phenomenon.

Here, we designed and fabricated a series of Fe\u2010N\u2010C hybrids as anodes for LIBs, including iron (Fe) nanoparticles cores encapsulated in well\u2010defined nitrogenated holey graphitic structures (Fe@C2N) and Fe encapsulated in a three\u2010dimensional (3D) cage\u2010like organic network (Fe@CON). Such hybrids display promising lithium ion storage properties. In particular, benefitting from its 3D\u2010interconnected microporous structure and rich Fe\u2010N\u2010C species, one Fe@CON (e.g., HCF@3DP) exhibits a superb reversible capacity of 747.3 mAh\u2009g\u22121 at 0.1 C, excellent rate capability (e.g., 320.8 mAh\u2009g\u22121 at 10 C) and long cycling stability (over 400 cycles).", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "adac95e79af20a69efb0f1559eda117da616b710", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2409668306", "CorpusId": 99573552}, "title": "Design in the process of controlling and utilizing carbon dioxide in oil and gas well with the technology of carbon capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "824f087c3069c993abbc6d317e53e81f2c89c848", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3162309761", "DOI": "10.2139/SSRN.3820784", "CorpusId": 236661524}, "title": "Subsurface Characterization for Secure CO2 Storage in the Pennsylvanian-permian Storage Complex in the Midcontinent Region, U.S.A.", "abstract": "Subsurface characterization of target injection and confining zones is essential for developing a safe and successful Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) project.

The IMSCS-HUB project area is comprised of a carbon dioxide (CO2) source corridor that runs from eastern Iowa to western Nebraska and a stacked CO2 storage corridor that spans across western Nebraska and Kansas, representing the first large-scale CCUS project for the Midcontinent Region. The deep saline reservoirs and caprocks of the IMSCS-HUB stacked storage corridor subsurface make up a Pennsylvanian-Permian Storage Complex which is characterized by thick stratigraphic successions of marine and non-marine sedimentary rocks, (i.e. cyclothems). These stratigraphic successions provide alternating sequences of deep saline formations, oil-bearing reservoirs, shale, and evaporite units that are conducive to vertically stacked CO2 injection for geologic storage and enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Selected areas within the IMSCS-HUB storage corridor have been identified for detailed CO2 storage site characterization in southwest-central Nebraska (Sleepy Hollow Site), in western Nebraska (Madrid Site), and in western Kansas (Patterson Site). As part of the IMSCS-HUB project, characterization wells were drilled, whole and sidewall core were acquired, advanced geophysical well logs were collected, and well testing was conducted the knowledge gaps at the selected storage sites. Regional and site-specific subsurface analyses of the Pennsylvanian-Permian Storage Complex in the Midcontinent Region are conducted to validate caprock integrity through stacked-injection simulations, and to inform the post-injection monitoring plan. The lateral and vertical extents of the formations of interest are defined through well log analysis and geologic mapping. The stress regime is defined using image log data, mini-fracture tests, and drill stem tests. Petrophysical and geomechanical properties of reservoir and caprock intervals are determined through core laboratory testing, advanced well log analysis (sonic and image logs), and well testing (mini-fracture and drill stem tests). The well testing data is also used to determine the fracture pressure gradient/injection pressure constraints. The core laboratory testing includes routine core analysis (porosity, permeability, net confining stress, and grain density), mercury injection capillary pressure, effective permeability, threshold entry pressure, and triaxial compressive strength. The results of the subsurface characterization are used to construct and populate the static earth model and are key inputs for stacked-injection simulations. Three-dimensional simulations assess the baseline stresses in the subsurface and provide information on the fracture gradient to estimate the maximum permissible injection pressure, simulate the mechanical integrity of the caprocks, and evaluate the risk of induced seismic events using an injection scenario of 50 million metric tons, per the CarbonSAFE objective.

Key geological storage properties (pressure, temperature, depth and permeability) can affect injectivity and lead to variations in CO2 flow, which feed back into the pipeline transportation system. In previous storage models, the interface between the reservoir performance and the transportation infrastructure is unclear and the models are unable to provide details for flow and pressure management within a transportation network in response to changes in the operation of storage sites. Variation in storage demand due to daily and seasonal variations of fossil fuels uses and by extension CO2 flow is also likely to influence transportation infrastructure availability and the capacity to deliver. This work evaluates, at the level of infrastructure planning, the impact of geological uncertainty on CCS pipeline transportation and injection infrastructure. The analysis presented shows how to consider uncertainty in store properties in combination with CO2 flow variability to estimate the likely impact on pipeline infrastructure design. The operational envelope of the storage site infrastructure is estimated by combining the Darcy flow analysis of simple reservoir models with rigorous process simulation of the storage site wells. The proximity of wellhead conditions to the CO2 equilibrium line and the maximum velocities inside the well constrain the operational envelope of the storage site and limit the ability of the storage site infrastructure to handle CO2 flow variation. These factors, which are significantly influenced by variations in subsurface conditions, have also an impact on the design of the offshore pipeline infrastructure, needing to accommodate changes in pressure delivery requirements. Based on the evaluation of examples developed for different offshore transportation scenarios relevant to the United Kingdom, detailed insight on the expected impacts of store properties on pipeline transportation infrastructure design and operation is provided. For instance, it is found that enabling storage site flexibility is simpler in stores with an initial pressure above 20 MPa. Given reductions in reservoir permeability, the requirements for pressure delivery are strongly dependent on the store temperature. Although the analysis is performed for specific geological characteristics in the North Sea the evaluation methodology is transferable to other locations and can be used for site screening to identify sites which are more flexible in terms of uncertainty in store performance. \u00a9 2016 The Authors.

Such fluids, especially those in nanoscale confinements that are of the order of molecular dimensions, have properties that are remarkably different from their bulk counterparts, and this influences their equilibrium, transport as well as reaction behaviour. While the subject is more than a century old, until recently there was only modest emphasis on the fundamental understanding of confined fluid behaviour. However, the last two decades have seen a major resurgence of interest because of the rapid growth in the applications of new nanomaterials, and the emergence of a vast array of nanotechnologies that exploit the complex behaviour of a fluid in confinement. These applications span a battery of conventional as well as developing technologies pertaining to catalysis, adsorption and separation including membrane-based processes, gas storage, nanolubrication, biochemical lab-on-the-chip systems, micro-electromechanical devices and drug delivery, to name only a few. It is now well understood that the fundamental assumptions behind the conventional continuum modelling become questionable at the nanoscale, where the atomic-scale texture of the fluid and of the confining surface plays an increasingly important role. A striking example of this is the rapid transport in carbon nanotubes, which is attributable to their relatively smooth energy landscape, when compared with zeolites or other conventional nanoporous materials; or the role of the surface protein structure and charges in mediating transport and switching properties of biological ion channels. Confinement at the nanoscale also leads to inhomogenieties and the breakdown of the usual constitutive laws governing continuum analysis. Statistical mechanics, incorporating appropriate intermolecular interactions, forms the crux of our craft in dealing with these complexities; however, rigorous analytical theories based on mechanical models involving many-body interactions fast become intractable when moving beyond the very simplest of systems. Molecular simulation then becomes the technique of choice in tackling the enormous variety of problems encountered in relation to confined fluid behaviour in applications of the kind indicated above. This special issue of the journal brings together leading researchers in the area in a single forum, covering a variety of applications where the focus is on confined fluid behaviour. Despite the multidisciplinary nature of the subject and the wide range of systems involved, there is a common thread of molecular mechanics which binds the area and which we seek to capture in this issue. I believe the breadth and the variety of the contributions have helped greatly in achieving this goal. For example, papers from the groups of MacElroy and Baumgaertner discuss the complex issues related to water and ionic transport in carbon nanotubes, which have special relevance to ion channels and other biological systems. Systems involving water have also long been of interest in adsorption science because of the intriguing issues related to hydrogen bonding, wetting and electrostatic interactions with surface functional groups; in recent years, this interest has been enhanced because of their influence on the transport in nanofluidic devices. These issues are addressed in the works from the groups of Fuchs and Aluru, while the paper by Suman and Kumar discusses the role of hydrophobic interactions in dendrimer adsorption on solid surfaces. The rapid pace of development of new nanomaterials during the last two decades has sparked a parallel effort addressing the challenge in understanding their fascinating adsorption and transport properties. The contributions from several groups (Broadbelt and Snurr; Johnson; Sholl; Papadopoulos and Theodorou; Keil; Srebnik and Sheintuch) provide an important insight into the complex issues pertinent to adsorption and transport in metal organic framework materials, pore mouth modified and pristine zeolites as well as carbon nanotubes and related composite materials. In my own laboratory at The University of Queensland, there has been a sustained recent effort in developing tractable analytical theories of transport in idealised nanopore models for MCM-41 and related silica materials as well as in carbons, in conjunction with simulations; and Nicholson provides a lucid summary of the key results and theories.

This research aims to control methane and carbon dioxide by applying novel intelligent MSW management system.

The operation of new system includes series of cells built subsequently with porous bricks that confines waste cells. This approach implies integrated operation system that combines waste disposal, biogas evacuation, and biogas control. Bricks are made up of hydrophobic recyclable material that might be available on waste disposal site. In this research, a recyclable hydrophobic polymer (Styrofoam) was tested at laboratory to check its functionality for biogas collection. The test procedure on polymer medium entails the following findings: the permeability, the conductivity and diffusion coefficients, the convective flowrate, and the diffusive flux through polymer medium for carbon dioxide and methane. The influence of parameters such as water content, porosity, temperature variation, pressure gradient, and concentration gradient on gas movement (diffusion and convection) was also analyzed. Information obtained from the laboratory tests were formulated as knowledge bases. The fuzzy logic implicated knowledge bases and specific rules to have the output that represents the gas transport rates in hydrophobic polymer medium for a wide range of various environmental parameters. Genetic algorithm is used to optimize a transfer function that represents solutions for transfer rates for different ratios of biogas mixture. The mass and volume of biogas within the landfill time of service are determined for designing hydrophobic porous bricks for any ratio of CH 4 :CO 2 in landfill. After having the cells finished and closed the configuration of the new system satisfies confining the waste with hydrophobic porous walls that surrounds the waste and captures all available biogas generated at the landfill. The design includes a system of valves evacuating biogas from porous walls of the bricks. The process of evacuation might link the valves with a blower that is connected with a storage tank or an energy generator.

Such studies are, however, extremely scarce due to the lack of suitable historical data. We use repeat historical photographs from the 1900s, 1950s, and 2010 to assess general trends in the quantity and size distributions of the tree stock in urban Sheffield and resultant aboveground carbon storage. Total tree numbers declined by a third from the 1900s to the 1950s, but increased by approximately 50% from the 1900s\u20132010, and by 100% from the 1950s\u20132010. Aboveground carbon storage in urban tree stocks had doubled by 2010 from the levels present in the 1900s and 1950s. The initial decrease occurred at a time when national and regional tree stocks were static and are likely to be driven by rebuilding following bombing of the urban area during the Second World War and by urban expansion. In 2010, trees greater than 10 m in height comprised just 8% of those present. The increases in total tree numbers are thus largely driven by smaller trees and are likely to be associated with urban tree planting programmes. Changes in tree stocks were not constant across the urban area but varied with the current intensity of urbanization. Increases from 1900 to 2010 in total tree stocks, and smaller sized trees, tended to be greatest in the most intensely urbanized areas. In contrast, the increases in the largest trees were more marked in areas with the most green space. These findings emphasize the importance of preserving larger fragments of urban green space to protect the oldest and largest trees that contribute disproportionately to carbon storage and other ecosystem services. Maintaining positive trends in urban tree stocks and associated ecosystem service provision will require continued investment in urban tree planting programmes in combination with additional measures, such as revisions to tree preservation orders, to increase the retention of such trees as they mature.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "2e13c2721658089bc21cbf7aa5e01365c5da5606", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2170354241", "DOI": "10.1007/S40328-014-0059-3", "CorpusId": 130016331}, "title": "On seismic monitoring of $$\\hbox {CO}_{2}$$CO2 leakage from geological storages and its primary detection", "abstract": "Geological storage of $$\\hbox {CO}_{2}$$CO2 in mature sedimentary basins and deep saline water aquifer requires special considerations on the potential leakage pathways.

One of the reasons behind global warming is the high concentration of green house gases in the atmosphere, which is a bi-product of fossil fuel combustion caused by human activity. Climate change did not become a European Union priority before the 21st century when the climate- and energy package was published stating the European Union climate and energy targets for 2020. In addition to the goals, the measures that will be taken to reach them were presented. One such measure was Carbon dioxide Capture and geological Storage, also known as CCS. In order for CCS to serve its purpose within the EU it is of great importance that it is operated under the same conditions and consequently regulated at Community level. This is the reason why the CCS Directive was established for carbon dioxide storage, a directive that will enter into force on June 25th 2011. \n \nThis Master's thesis is focused on the CCS Directive\u2019s regulation of the financial liability of carbon dioxide storage. The directive, however, contains several unanswered questions with regards to the financial liability, questions that the member states are expected to regulate at national level according to the principle of subsidiary. These unanswered questions will be answered in this essay, using proposals according to de lege ferenda. Inspiration and guidance as to how the states can solve the unanswered questions about the financial liability for long-term storage has come from the Swedish nuclear law. The reason for applying the nuclear law to this de lege ferenda study is that carbon dioxide storage along with final storage of nuclear waste concern very long-periods of time, where the juridical person, with its financial liability for the activity, most likely will not see the end of the storage period. In both cases it is a requirement that funds are dedicated to future storage in order to avoid the state for being ultimately responsible to carry the cost. Consequently, the financial liability for nuclear waste and for carbon dioxide storage are both based on a question which require careful consideration; on the one hand, the public benefit that the activity brings, and on the other, the state\u2019s risk being ultimate responsible for the financial liability. This fundamental similarity between the purposes of the two legislations is in this case the clue to the de lege ferenda study, which brings realistic solutions to the CCS Directive\u2019s unanswered questions. The proposed de lege ferenda study has therefore answered the questions of for example the type of financial security the operator should apply and how the cost of the financial security should be estimated and securely set aside. However, it is not just the unanswered questions that the CCS Directive has required the Member States to regulate; this de lege ferenda study has come to answer. The study has also brought clarity to issues the states need to take into consideration when forming the national legislation. An example would in this case be the proposal to make the fee of the financial security a function of the amount of stored carbon dioxide.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "17c25073d370cc9a576ee075113a4558f692d43b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2501916923", "DOI": "10.1007/s10098-015-0995-9", "CorpusId": 114300721}, "title": "Recent advances in green energy and product productions, environmentally friendly, healthier and safer technologies and processes, CO2 capturing, storage and recycling, and sustainability assessment in decision-making", "abstract": "Abstract\nThis paper presents a short overview of some of the more current advances related to the productions of green energy and products; to environmentally friendly, healthier and safer technologies and processes; advances in CO2 capturing, storage, and recycling; and novel methods for sustainability assessment in decision-making.

This paper provides a synoptic discussion of the external drivers of stream temperature, the internal hydrologic processes that insulate and buffer channel watertemperatures, and the mechanisms of human influence on drivers and stream structure which ultimately alter the temperature regime of stream networks. Key management implications include: 1) in-channel water flow is a critical element for reestablishing desirable thermal regimes in streams; 2) in addition to modified riparian vegetation structure, human alteration of groundwater dynamics and channel morphology are critical pathways of human influence on channel-water temperature; 3) the potential success of stream temperature research and monitoring programs will be jeopardized by an inaccurate or incomplete conceptual understanding of complex temporal and spatial patterns of stream temperature response to anthropogenic influences; and 4) watershed assessment, including analyses of landuse history and analysis of historic vs. contemporary structure of the stream channel, riparian zone, and alluvial aquifer, is an important tool in developing effective management prescriptions for meeting water quality targets for in-channel temperature. Stream temperature directly influences the metabolic rates, physiology, and life history traits of aquatic species and helps to determine rates of important community processes such as nutrient cycling and productivity (Allen 1995). Natural or anthropogenic fluctuations in water temperature can induce a wide array of behavioral and physiological responses in aquatic organisms and more permanent changes in stream temperature can render formerly suitable habitat unusable for native species assemblages (Holtby 1988, Wissmar and others 1994a, Quigley and Arbelbide 1997). Because of the importance of stream temperature in regulating biochemical processes in lotic systems, preventing or mitigating anthropogenic changes in stream temperature has become a common concern for many resource managers (Coutant 1999). Unfortunately, management actions do not always adequately consider the multitude of interacting environmental processes that determine stream temperature regimes nor the wide variety of pathways by which human activities may affect stream temperature. In this paper, we attempt to succinctly describe a number of these important processes and pathways. Our most detailed discussions focus on heat energy exchange and transport within stream systems because, in our opinion, these processes provide great promise for successful stream temperature management yet are most often overlooked during the development management plans. Although the discussion and examples in this paper focus on the Poole and Berman Human influences on stream temperature 2 Pacific Norwest, USA, the ecological principles and processes discussed are applicable to lotic systems in general. Fluvial System Structure Current understanding of stream ecology indicates that streams are comprised of at least three integrated and interdependent components: the channel, riparian zone, and alluvial aquifer (Stanford and Ward 1988, Ward 1989, Stanford and Ward 1993, Gibert and others 1994, Findlay 1995, Ward 1998a, Ward 1998b). From this perspective, the \u201cedge\u201d of a river is not defined by its channel margin, but rather by the edge of the riparian zone (Gregory and others 1991). Similarly, the \u201cbottom\u201d of a river is not the stream bed, but the bottom of the alluvial aquifer (Ward 1998b). These components are set within the context of the catchment\u2019s surface and groundwater flow network. (Figure 1). Channel water temperature is ultimately determined by the interactions between external drivers of stream temperature and the internal structure of the integrated stream system. The presence and importance of specific drivers and stream characteristics vary across spatial scales and are determined in part by landscape context. Together, they interact to produce heterogeneity in stream temperature at a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Although other factors also affect stream temperature, the primary determinants of stream temperature are climatic drivers (such as air temperature and wind speed), stream morphology, groundwater influences, and riparian canopy condition (Sullivan and Adams 1991). Therefore, this paper focuses on the importance of stream morphology, groundwater influences, and riparian canopy conditions as factors that both markedly influence stream temperature and are also substantively altered by various human activities. The stream channel is the portion of a stream system that transports water across the earth\u2019s surface. The channel boundary is approximately the typical annual high water level on each stream bank. Some streams have multiple threads to their channels (Leopold and Wolman 1957, Kellerhalls and others 1976, Mosley 1987). This underscores the fact that a stream channel may be discontinuous in cross section, comprised of the main channel, side channels, and perhaps channels that are active only during the period of annual high flow. Where floodplains are present, the locations of channels change over time (Leopold and others 1964, Naiman and others 1992). Sometimes these changes occur gradually over decades as streams erode the outer banks along stream meanders and deposit sediment along the inner banks. In other instances, streams in flood stage rapidly cut new channels or re-capture previously abandoned channels (Nanson and Channel Riparian Zone Hyporheic Zone Phreatic Zone Streambed Preferential Flow Path (Paleochannel) Alluvial Aquifer Figure 1. Structural components of a stream system. Not all features exist in all streams. Poole and Berman Human influences on stream temperature 3 Knighton 1996). Channel migration processes are important for the creation and maintenance of floodplain complexity. This complexity, in turn, directly influences important in-stream dynamics (e.g., nutrient and carbon cycles, natural floodwater storage, and water temperature buffers) and enhances the variety of available aquatic and terrestrial habitats thereby supporting biological diversity (Sedell and Froggatt 1984, Harvey and Bencala 1993, Creuz\u00e9 des Chatelliers and others 1994, Abbe and Montgomery 1996). The riparian zone is the area of land influenced by moisture derived directly from the stream. For small streams, this area may only extend a short distance (10 to 10 m) laterally from the channel margin. However, for larger streams, the riparian zone extends much further (10 to 10 m), at least to the edge of the active floodplain (Gregory and others 1991). For the great rivers of the world such as the Mississippi and Amazon, the riparian zone sometimes extends even further (10 to 10 m) (Salo and others 1986). Riparian zones form the transition zone (or ecotone) between terrestrial and aquatic systems. Periodic flooding of the riparian zone encourages the exchange of water, nutrients, sediments, and energy between the river channel and the riparian zone. This exchange creates unique habitats, enhances natural productivity, and drives biological processes that contribute to the ecological complexity and integrity of stream systems (Ward 1998a). A stream\u2019s alluvium (sediments that have been deposited and sorted as the result of hydraulic processes) along with the groundwater contained therein form the alluvial aquifer (Creuz\u00e9 des Chatelliers and others 1994). Generally speaking, the alluvial aquifer includes the sediments that underlie the riparian zone (or floodplain) and the sediments that comprise the streambed. In streams that flow across bedrock, alluvial deposits (and therefore the alluvial aquifer) may be no more extensive than pockets of sediment trapped in depressions in the bedrock. In most large rivers, however, the upper substrate of the floodplain is built entirely from alluvial deposits which can be meters thick. Stream channels actively exchange water back and forth with their alluvial aquifer (Gibert and others 1994). Hyporheic groundwater is water that infiltrates into the alluvial aquifer from the stream, travels along localized subsurface flow pathways for relatively short periods of time (perhaps from 10 to 10 days), and re-emerges into the stream channel downstream without leaving the alluvial aquifer. The portion of the alluvial aquifer that contains at least some hyporheic groundwater (White 1993) is referred to as the hyporheic zone (Stanford and Ward 1988, Brunke and Gonser 1997). Therefore, there are two types of groundwater that influence streams, hyporheic groundwater and phreatic groundwater (water derived from the catchment aquifer). Phreatic groundwater feeding a river enters the alluvial aquifer and eventually mixes with hyporheic groundwater. Depending on subsurface flow dynamics, the groundwater released into the stream channel at a given point may be predominantly phreatic, predominantly hyporheic, or a mixture of both. The hyporheic zone can exert an extremely strong influence on the biological, chemical, and physical processes that occur in a river (Stanford and Ward 1993, Findlay 1995, Brunke and Gonser 1997). Water Temperature in Stream Channels Water temperature is not a simple measure of the amount of heat energy in a stream reach. Temperature is proportional to heat energy divided by the volume of water: Water Temp \u221d Heat Energy / Water Volume Conceptually, water temperature can be thought of as a measure of the \u201c", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "a511d5ccab0c7b45a3528cddc754b0656bdbafe6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1728325655", "CorpusId": 54948040}, "title": "Oxy-combustion in gas turbine applications", "abstract": "Faced with the increasing concern about the effect of greenhouse gases in global warming, Carbon Capture and Storage technologies are developed.

One possible solution to this is the natural formation of CO2 hydrates. Gas hydrate has an ice-like structure in which small gas molecules are trapped within cages of water molecules.

N deposition in combination with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and water limitation may alter C and N storage in urban forests. This review aimed to provide a better understanding of N and C storage under N deposition scenarios in urban forests.Results and discussionGlobally, fuel combustion and biomass burning contribute in approximately 70 and 16\u00a0% of the NOx emission respectively. It is also estimated that NHy and NOx are two to four times higher in urban forests compared to rural areas. However, higher N deposition may not always result in increased N and C storage in urban forests. In fact, urban forests may even show early symptoms of N and C losses under climate change. For example, urban forests in fire-prone areas require higher frequency of burning to reduce the threat of wildfires, leading to an acceleration of C and N loss. Additionally, chronic N deposition may result in an early N loss in urban forests due to faster N saturation and soil acidification in urban forests compared to rural forests. Studies of N deposition on urban forests using N isotope composition (\u03b415N) also showed that N loss from urban forests can occur through the direct leaching of the deposited NO3\u2212-N. We also noted that using different 15N signal of soil and plant in combination of tree ring \u03b415N may provide a better understanding of N movement in urban forests.ConclusionsAlthough urban forests may become a source of C and N faster than rural forests, N-limited urban forests may benefit from N deposition to retain both N and C stocks longer than non-N-limited urban forests. Appropriate management practices may also help to delay such symptoms; however, the main source of emission still needs to be managed to reduce both N deposition and rising atmospheric CO2 in urban forests. Otherwise, the N and C stocks in urban forests may further decline when prolonged drought conditions under global climate change increase the frequency of fires and reduce plant photosynthesis.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "d3c1158e7fbdec526f8d5fdf796c944e64fbaada", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3934/energy.2022011", "CorpusId": 248029878}, "title": "Analysing the systemic implications of energy efficiency and circular economy strategies in the decarbonisation context", "abstract": "\n The Paris Agreement goals require a rapid and deep reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions.

One such renewable source of energy is biomass, which has the added advantage of being a near-term source of hydrogen. While there are several potential routes to produce hydrogen from biomass thermally, given the near-term technical barriers to hydrogen storage and delivery, distributed technologies such that hydrogen is produced at or near the point of use are attractive. One such route is to first produce bio-oil via fast pyrolysis of biomass close to its source to create a higher energy-density product, then ship this bio-oil to its point of use where it can be reformed to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. This route is especially well suited for smaller-scale reforming plants located at hydrogen distribution sites such as filling stations. There is also the potential for automated operation of the conversion system. A system has been developed for volatilizing bio-oil with manageable carbon deposits using ultrasonic atomization and by modifying bio-oil properties, such as viscosity, by blending or reacting bio-oil with methanol. Non-catalytic partial oxidation of bio-oil is then used to achieve significant conversion to CO withmore\u00a0\u00bb minimal aromatic hydrocarbon formation by keeping the temperature at 650 C or less and oxygen levels low. The non-catalytic reactions occur primarily in the gas phase. However, some nonvolatile components of bio-oil present as aerosols may react heterogeneously. The product gas is passed over a packed bed of precious metal catalyst where further reforming as well as water gas shift reactions are accomplished completing the conversion to hydrogen. The approach described above requires significantly lower catalyst loadings than conventional catalytic steam reforming due to the significant conversion in the non-catalytic step. The goal is to reform and selectively oxidize the bio-oil and catalyze the water gas shift reaction without catalyzing methanation or oxidation of CO and H{sub 2}, thus attaining equilibrium levels of H{sub 2}, CO, H{sub 2}O, and CO{sub 2} at the exit of the catalyst bed. Experimental Bio-oil (mixed with varied amounts of methanol to reduce the viscosity and homogenize the bio-oil) or selected bio-oil components are introduced at a measured flow rate through the top of a vertical quartz reactor which is heated using a five zone furnace. The ultrasonic nozzle used to feed the reactants allows the bio-oil to flow down the center of the reactor at a low, steady flow rate. Additionally, the fine mist created by the nozzle allows for intimate mixing with oxygen and efficient heat transfer, providing optimal conditions to achieve high conversion at relatively low temperatures in the non-catalytic step thus reducing the required catalyst loading. Generation of the fine mist is especially important for providing good contact between non-volatile bio-oil components and oxygen. Oxygen and helium are also delivered at the top of the reactor via mass flow meters with the amount of oxygen being varied to maximize the yields of H{sub 2} and CO and the amount of helium being adjusted such that the gas phase residence time in the hot zone is {approx}0.3 and {approx}0.45 s for bio-oil and methanol experiments, respectively. A catalyst bed can be located at the bottom of the reactor tube. To date, catalyst screening experiments have used Engelhard noble metal catalysts. The catalysts used for these experiments were 0.5 % rhodium, ruthenium, platinum, and palladium (all supported on alumina). Experiments were performed using pure alumina as well. Both the catalyst type and the effect of oxygen and steam on the residual hydrocarbons and accumulated carbon containing particulates were investigated. The residence time before the catalyst is varied to determine the importance of the non-catalytic step and its potential effect on the required catalyst loading. Non-catalytic experiments (primarily homogeneous cracking) use a bed of quartz placed to capture any deposits that are formed in the volatilization and cracking zones. The inner reactor effluent is quenched by a flow of 10 SLPM He which serves to sweep the products quickly ({approx}0.03 s) to a triple quadrupole molecular beam mass spectrometer (MBMS) for analysis. The MBMS serves as a universal detector and allows for real time data collection. The study of pyrolysis by MBMS has been described previously. The dilution of the reactor effluent reduces the potential problems caused by matrix effects associated with the MBMS analysis. Argon is used as an internal standard in the quantitative analysis of all the major products (CO, CO{sub 2}, H{sub 2}, H{sub 2}O, and benzene) as well as any residual carbon, which is determined by subsequent oxidation of carbon (monitored as CO{sub 2}) after shutting off the feed and maintaining the oxygen/helium flow.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "790c683761a38470b3dbca8ffcb5e2530f5885d4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2046896954", "DOI": "10.1021/JF9608938", "CorpusId": 28839857, "PubMed": "10554290"}, "title": "Influence of Different Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide Concentrations during Storage on Production of Volatile Compounds by Starking Delicious Apples.", "abstract": "Starking Delicious apples were cold-stored in semicommercial chambers in normal atmosphere and in different controlled atmospheres in which oxygen and carbon dioxide were held at 1%, 2%, and 3% for 3, 5, and 7 months.

A file system view at the controller, together with the knowledge of which arriving block belongs to which file or inode, will enable the detection of file-level threats. In this paper, we present IDStor, an IDS for block-based storage. IDStor acts as a listener to storage traffic, out of the controller's I/O path, and is therefore attractive for integration into existing SAN-based storage solutions. IDStor maintains a block-to-file mapping that is updated online. Using this mapping, IDStor infers the semantics of file-level commands from the intercepted block-level operations, thereby detecting file-level intrusions by merely observing the block read and write commands passing between the hosts and the controller.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "2abb0edbf7bed8634b1b092e2c8311d66a06702d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2471281574", "CorpusId": 132708842}, "title": "ABSTRACT: CO2 Carbon Capture and Storage in the 21st Century: Pore Space to Commerciality - An Alberta Perspective", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "9bc404f205d609d814157d0d0f6a5f6a0673d8a7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2784186576", "DOI": "10.4172/2157-7617-C1-036", "CorpusId": 134760361}, "title": "The role for strategic environmental assessment (SEA) & environmental impact assessment (EIA) for carbon capture and storage in Japan", "abstract": null, "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "817370855b23df3fd43eee8c28613057a61a553a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2113499420", "DBLP": "conf/ideas/BrakatsoulasPT04", "DOI": "10.1109/IDEAS.2004.45", "CorpusId": 554651}, "title": "Modeling, storing and mining moving object databases", "abstract": "Urban areas get more and more congested everyday due to the increasing number of moving vehicles.

First, we use a backward-division model, which can rapidly solve the distortion of fish eye lens. Second, in order to maintain consistency of stitching, use the cylindrical projection. Third, we apply SIFT feature detection method to image mosaic process. To ensure the accuracy of matching, we use the RANSAC algorithm to purify the detected feature points. In addition, we use an image fusion method based on Lapalace pyramid. The original images captured by fisheye multi-cameras device are processed according to the procedure described in this paper, and then the cylindrical panoramic image is obtained.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "f6497cb677658a99578fc0bf6e236b763b9fe1f6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2060950913", "DOI": "10.1007/s003740000248", "CorpusId": 39984735}, "title": "Soil organic carbon stocks, storage profile and microbial biomass under different crop management systems in a tropical agricultural ecosystem", "abstract": "Abstract\u2002We investigated the soil organic C and N stocks, storage profiles and microbial biomass as influenced by different crop management systems in a tropical agricultural ecosystem.

Spermatozoa were collected from the vasa deferens of three mature Bryde's whales captured during the Japanese whale research in the north-west Pacific (May to August 2007) after death. The three semen extenders used for freezing were 1) a commercialized synthetic extender (AndroMed: AM), 2) Tris-based + 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 3) Tris-based + egg yolk (EY). The sperm samples from the three whales were frozen with the three extenders, and the post-thaw spermatozoa were stored at three different temperatures (35 C; 20-25 C, room temperature; and 5 C) for 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h. At each time-point, total and progressive motility (PM), viability (live or dead), the hypo-osmotic test, defective acrosomes and malformation were examined. Immediately after thawing, AM resulted in similar recovery rates (60.4 and 83.3%) in 2 of the 3 whales examined and had comparable post-thaw recovery rates to those obtained using the EY and BSA extenders. Immediately after thawing, the proportion of PM in EY (17.6%) was higher (P<0.05) than that in BSA (15.0%). In the hypo-osmotic test, the proportions of AM (26.0%) and BSA (25.2%) were higher (P<0.05) than that of EY (17.3 %). The three extenders had similar viabilities (36.7, 37.9 and 32.1%, respectively), but the viability of BSA was higher (P<0.05) than that of EY. The present study showed that a synthetic semen extender, AndroMed, could be used for cryopreservation of whale spermatozoa in addition to Tris-based extenders containing bovine serum albumin or egg yolk. Storage of the post-thaw Bryde's whale spermatozoa was better at 5 C than at room temperature or 35 C. The frozen-thawed Bryde's whale spermatozoa maintained their motility and viability for at least two days at room temperature and for four days at 5 C.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "7eb957d68e38687c72d979f4776c59dfb4125f24", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2599358662", "CorpusId": 157409658}, "title": "Reawakening A Paralysed CCS Agenda in Europe - A Study of Industry Stakeholders' Positions on Carbon Capture and Storage Technologies", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "b1f8643f0f7e0a8c6556953034b62f240d8ec0c2", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "8097903", "MAG": "3157695072", "DOI": "10.1186/s13021-021-00174-7", "CorpusId": 233733541, "PubMed": "33948762"}, "title": "Tree diversity and carbon stocks in agroforestry systems in northern Ethiopia", "abstract": "Background Agroforestry (AF) is an ancient tradition in Ethiopian dryland farming system. Several studies have examined system design, soil fertility management and system interactions, but the biodiversity and mitigation aspects of climate change have received less focus. We assessed the diversity of woody species, biomass carbon (C), and soil organic carbon (SOC) stock associated with indigenous dryland AF practices. A total of 197 smallholder farmers representing four AF practices (home garden, parkland, boundary plantation, and woodlot) from lowland, midland, and highland areas were systematically selected. The inventory of woody species was carried out on each farm's randomly formed plot. Results We identified a total of 59 woody species representing 48 genera and 32 families. Shannon diversity index (H') was highest in home garden and parkland AF, while woodlots had the highest mean total stock of biomass C (31\u00a0Mg\u00a0C\u00a0ha \u22121 ). C stocks for smallholding systems (total biomass C and SOC 0\u201360\u00a0cm) ranged from 77\u2013135\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha \u22121 . Total biomass C stocks were significantly correlated with abundance (Spearman r\u2009=\u20090.333; p\u2009=\u20090.002) but biomass components were not significantly correlated with H'. SOC soil depth stock (0\u201360\u00a0cm) was positively and significantly associated with H' (Spearman r\u2009=\u20090.291 & 0.351; p\u2009<\u20090.01). Conclusions We report greater species richness in home garden and parkland AF systems than in woodlots. While parkland AF produce lower biomass and SOC stock relative to other AF systems. The strategic use of home gardens and boundary planting can improve tree diversity and carbon storage in Ethiopian dryland ecosystems.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "637118d96507a4eba8bca9b566658cad9d4f8f0a", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 162176870}, "title": "Carbon Dioxide Sequestration Option on Alaskan North Slope", "abstract": "Conventional power plants generate electricity by combustion of fossil fuels. The emission of CO 2 gas, which is a green house gas, as a result of this combustion has led to increase in CO 2 concentration in atmosphere. Carbon sequestration can be defined as the reduction of CO 2 by capture from the point sources like power plants and subsurface storage. The subsurface CO 2 storage can be achieved by injection of CO 2 for sequestration in aquifers by means of mineral trapping and hydrodynamic trapping (Gunter et al., 1996), depleted oil and gas reservoirs by taking advantage of naturally available seal, coal seams, or viscous oil recovery by CO 2 flooding. According to EPA\u2019s Energy CO 2 inventory, the state of Alaska emitted 41 Million tons of CO 2 during the year of 2000. The combustion of fossil fuels from industrial and electric utilities contributed around 20 Million tons to the total CO 2 emissions. Due to absence of any CO 2 sequestration studies for Alaska, the current project, the study of CO 2 sequestration options in Alaska, will open new avenues for the assessment of carbon dioxide disposal options in Alaska.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "4db84c452b3cc270f1477e278946a73c87a17205", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2965258946", "CorpusId": 201304194}, "title": "CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE (CCS) IS EXPECTED TO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN MEETING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTION TARGETS", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}]}
