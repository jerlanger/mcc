In Europe, the recently proposed stricter emission reduction targets for 2030 are likely to increase the price for CO2 emission allowances. Various different GHG emission mitigation alternatives have been considered to enable decarbonisation of the iron and steel industry, such as energy efficiency, biogenic reducing agents, hydrogen and CCS. However, not all of these can be deployed for the most important production route \u2013 the blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace route (BF + BOF) \u2013 and all the solutions have advantages and disadvantages. CCS is currently the only mitigation option available for significantly reducing emissions from this energy-intensive industry. A full chain assessment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) applications for the iron and steel industry was performed in order to screen technology options and build a development pathway to low carbon steelmaking for future carbonconstrained world. A techno-economic assessment of application of CCS with various technologies in the iron and steel industry was carried out to create a knowledge base for a Nordic steel producer. The assessment was conducted for two different CO2 capture alternatives, namely post-combustion carbon capture and oxygen blast furnaces (OBF) with flue gas circulation. Processes were assessed by technical modelling based on the Aspen Plus process simulator and the economic evaluation toolkit CC-Skynet using two indicators: the break-even price of CO2 emission allowances for CCS and the impact of CCS on steel production costs. With the whole chain approach, including CO2 capture, processing, transport and storage, the results show a significant reduction potential at an integrated steel mill for all carbon capture technologies assessed. The application of an OBF would require a larger modification of the processes of the existing steel mill than that required by the application of post-combustion capture. The staged construction and implementation of CCS in order to minimise the financial investment risk was considered and several pathways for implementation were analysed. Only transportation of CO2 by ship was considered due to the coast-line location of the installation far from other emission sources, pipeline infrastructures and storage sites. Results show the cost structure and feasibility of the studied technologies. Cost break-even points for CCS at an integrated steel mill, for the plant owner and costs for globally avoided emissions are calculated. The direct site emissions were reduced by 0.28\u20132.93 Mt CO2/a. The cases resulting in significant reductions represent 48\u201373% of direct site emissions.

Over the years, the success of this technology has been relatively limited. Reasons for this include lack of acceptance of storage, but also a lack of economic feasibility. In many cases, projects need to be funded through subsidies or are justified on the basis of use for enhanced oil recovery. Meanwhile an enormous effort has been placed into lowering the cost of capture. Many R&D programs have set the target to reduce cost from typically 50 $/ton to 25 $/ton, while even now this kind of reductions have not been realized, to the contrary there has been an increase in reported cost.\n This paper addresses the background of the situation. It gives a literature overview of different technologies and the associated cost. A cost analysis is made of the different components in a CO2 capture plant. Comparison is made for the different technologies for post, pre- and oxy-combustion. The reasons for the high cost is analyzed and it is shown that no silver bullets exist. Several smart technologies are currently in development and the latest insights are given in how these technologies can reduce cost. A few studies are given that show why these technologies could not fulfill the initial expectations.\n The results show that there is a tendency that advantages of technology solutions are often off-set by disadvantages that are not foreseen at the early Research stages, often because the new systems are more complicated than the state-of-the-art. This includes engineering cost for mitigate these dis advantages. An example is the use of smart solvents with phase change involved. This process may lead to lower OPEX due to lower energy consumption, but cost is increased by the higher cost for doing the separation or for keeping the solvents from leaving the solvent.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "fea85d9f5b149691a9c4c20e41c49e14fc57da3a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2974084593", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3366005", "CorpusId": 201703041}, "title": "CCUS Scenarios for the Cement Industry: Is CO2 Utilization Feasible?", "abstract": "Driven by a green agenda, governments\u2019 commitment to reduce carbon footprint, and the need for value creation to support carbon capture, many novel carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies to convert CO2 into fuels, minerals or value-added chemicals have been reported. In a recent roadmap, the potential of CO2 utilization adds up to a maximum of 7 Gt of CO2 uptake per year by 2030 [1]. As the quantity of CO2 uptake by CCU is limited by the market, and given that the global emissions from the energy sector stood at 32.1 Gt in 2016 [2], the CCU option can only be complementary to CO2 storage, in order to achieve a significant decarbonisation through carbon capture. The cement industry is one of the major sources of CO2, corresponding to about 6-7% of global anthropogenic emissions. About 60% of these emissions come from mineral decomposition (CaCO3 to CaO), and the remainder is from fuel combustion. CO2 is therefore an unavoidable by-product of the process and in order to significantly reduce the climate impact of cement production, carbon capture is unavoidable. As consequence, the IEA points to CCS as the major contributor to emission reductions in the cement industry (56% by 2050, with up to 920 Mt of CO2 stored per year) to be deployed from 2020 [3]. In the framework of the H2020 CEMCAP project [4], a reference cement plant was defined based on the best available technique standard as defined in the European BREF-Document for the manufacture of cement. This reference plant has a clinker capacity of 3,000 t/d, which corresponds to a yearly cement production of 1.36 Mt per year, with a specific CO2 emission of 625 kg/t cement [5]. The best CCUS option for each cement plant is dependent on the plant location, as the local market demands, waste heat availability within the plant, and local availability of geological storage sites, for instance, will influence the economics of the CCUS chain. In order to evaluate the feasibility of CCUS technologies in connection to the cement industry, and to understand the interaction between utilization and storage, four illustrative scenarios are evaluated in this work. A scenario for CO2 geological storage in a deep saline aquifer is defined (CCS). For the scenario, it is assumed that the CO2 is transported to a storage formation on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The models presented in Jakobsen et al.

Therefore, in the present work the capability of a new molecular based equation of state (EoS) to describe these properties was evaluated by comparing the model predictions against literature experimental data. \n \nThe EoS considered herein is based on an accurate statistical associating fluid theory with variable range interaction through Mie potentials (SAFT-VR Mie EoS). The EoS was used to describe the vapor-liquid equilibria (VLE) and the densities of selected mixtures.

The viscosity model considered is the TRAPP method using the single phase densities, calculated from the EoS.

Captured CO2 is not pure and may contain several impurities, which affect the flow dynamics of the CO2 fluid in pipelines. To design efficient CO2 pipeline transportation systems, it is imperative to understand the effect of these impurities on the flow behaviour. Aspen HYSYS (V10) and HydraFlash were used to study the behaviour of 90 mol % CO2 and 10 mol % single impurity (N2, CH4, H2, H2S, SO2, Ar, CO, NH3, O2 and H2O). The Peng-Robinson equation of state (EoS), which has the lowest average absolute deviation (AAD) among cubic EoS for predicting CO2 fluid properties, was used in Aspen HYSYS. Three different 50 km pipelines were simulated; one horizontal pipeline and two pipelines with +300 and -300 m in elevation between inlet and outlet respectively. The mass flow rate is 266,400 kg/h and the internal and external diameters of the pipelines are 0.289 m and 0.324 m respectively. All impurities changed the parameters of the flowing fluid.

The role of CCUS as a tool to mitigate emissions has been increasingly studied and applied, for example at this series of conferences and through coordinated research around the world (e.g. Carbon Capture and Storage Flagship Program in Australia, Regional Carbon Sequestration partnerships in the US, and a whole range of projects in Norway such as Sleipner). \n \nThe overall value chain and processes typically encompass: \n\u2022 Capture technology (e.g. natural gas clean-up, coal combustion, industrial processes, hydrogen production) \n\u2022 Utilisation (e.g. EOR, production of chemicals, geothermal) \n\u2022 Transportation by pipeline and shipping \n\u2022 Geological storage (aquifer, depleted hydrocarbon fields, EOR, coal, basalts etc.) \n\u2022 Monitoring of storage over the longer term (leakage, environmental impacts) \nThese activities are underpinned by regulatory frameworks, international standards, government policy/legislation and social license to operate. \n \nWhile it is not expected that everyone employed or facing CCUS has expert levels of understanding of all facets of CCUS, few may be familiar or comfortable with the (a) technology (b) footprint (c) scale (d) impacts of the different parts of the CCUS process. How were these observations made? The CSIRO booth at the GHGT-14 Conference in Melbourne (2018) was set up to accommodate two virtual reality (VR) stations with a virtual tour of a carbon capture and storage journey (Figure 1). This was navigated in part by the visitor (i.e. wearing the VR headset) or controlled by the tour guide (operator) or both. The tour provides the visitor with a reasonable proxy for a carbon capture and storage plant. \n \nThe use of VR can make significant steps in overcoming this lack of built project in the early stages of full-scale development of CCUS (or other large-scale emerging industries) globally. VR could be used in obtaining social license as it could provide much clearer context for community groups where new developments might take place. Some aspects of the tour are highly conceptualized, in particular the space in the base of the well, the diameter of the well bore and the use of bubbles to mimic CO2 movement. Typically, the CO2 would be injected as a supercritical fluid, not bubbles, but that is harder to render for the purposes of the tour. \n \nKey observations from running the tours over the course of the conference were that prior to taking part in the VR tour most attendees had not really considered what their levels of understanding of the whole of the CCUS process might be. After the tour they felt much more enlightened and comfortable to discuss those aspects; they understood better the challenges in areas that they were not so familiar with and felt better informed to discuss the different steps in the process with non-specialists. Geological storage has been much more challenging to convey through other imagery, description and information/education [1]. The perception of depth and presence of geological rock overburden as a seal to retard CO2 mobility was therefore much better understood. Areas where the visitor could interact with the location and environment were more engaging and the sense of being transported to another location or environment to interact at a site without induction training, personal protective equipment and no change in climate was not lost on those participating. \n \nThe tours have now been used in a few Open House activities in relation to the CSIRO In-Situ Laboratory field trial to provide a sense of context for the local community, but a more systematic approach to testing the role of VR tours in social license is required to evaluate this approach as a mechanism to better inform the public of CCUS and its impact locally.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "24a3e932cdd3893847621a6875a7e11fa3183868", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2355494906", "CorpusId": 111965336}, "title": "Development of Low Carbon Emission Coal-fired Power Plant and Its Trend", "abstract": "As technology advancing and environmental requirements becoming more stringent,control CO2 emission has become an unavoidable task to the whole power industry.China's research and application in this field lag foreign countries.Building low carbon emission coal firing power plants with CO2 capture and storage(CCS)is a task for the development of future coal-fired power plants.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "b56c39f70ec6d0794d92420deca181e47c76a884", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1017/sus.2021.24", "CorpusId": 239607273}, "title": "The geopolitics of negative emissions technologies: learning lessons from REDD+ and renewable energy for afforestation, BECCS, and direct air capture", "abstract": "Non-technical summary Negative emissions technologies (NETs) have received increasing interest in recent years as a potential part of a portfolio of measures to address anthropogenic climate change, in particular following the 2015 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement and the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report \u2018Global Warming of 1.5 \u00b0C\u2019.

For the CCU scenarios to match the Reference Scenario without capture, the carbon tax should increase up to around 150-160 \u20ac/tCO2 in the chemical industry case and 320-330 \u20ac/tCO2 in the mobility case.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "32d69dfa757f80beac8af98e1c1e9293a2486d61", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3390/en15030813", "CorpusId": 246345459}, "title": "Ship-Based Carbon Capture and Storage: A Supply Chain Feasibility Study", "abstract": "The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) calls for the maritime industry to restrict its CO2 emissions by \u221240% (IMO2030) and \u221270% (IMO2050).

It involves capture of CO2 from industrial units (e.g. power plants and cement factories), followed by transport and then injection of the captured CO2 into underground reservoirs, such as saline aquifers, or depleted oil and gas reservoirs, for geological storage. Long-term safe containment of stored CO2 relies on the sealing integrity of the overlying caprock overlying the storage reservoir, as well as any pre-existing faults bounding the system. For many existing and potential CO2 storage sites, clay-rich shales and mudstones form the primary caprock. To assess the leakage risk of CO2 through clay-rich caprocks and along initially sealed faults, the interactions between the caprock material and CO2-rich fluid, and its effect on sealing integrity must be well understood under CO2 storage conditions. In many clay-rich caprocks, swelling clays, such as smectites, are pervasively present. It is known that upon interaction with CO2 and/or water, these clays swell. However, it has not yet been investigated how their swelling behavior impacts caprock and fault integrity under in-situ conditions. This thesis addresses an experimentally-based study on the self-stressing effect in smectite clays induced by volumetric swelling of the smectite due to interactions with CO2 and H2O.

The most attractive perspective is the safe and stable sequestration of the captured carbon into solid carbonates that could be exploited as building materials. The research has been directed towards the optimization of the main steps of the process: i) the absorption of CO2 into the aqueous phase; ii) the precipitation of carbonate minerals from the enriched aqueous stream supplied with a proper metal ion source. The first step is strongly limited as regards both the absorption capacity of the liquid phase and the rate of CO2 conversion in carbonic acid. Regarding the latter issue, several authors proposed a biomimetic approach: the Carbonic Anhydrase (CA) enzyme catalysis for the hydration of the dissolved CO2. The enzyme is ubiquitous in nature and it is able to rapidly convert CO2 into bicarbonate ion as well as to catalyse the inverse reaction (turnover close to 10 6 s -1 ). The key features of the CA-assisted CO2 capture processes are: i) the water where the CO2 dissolves and converts; ii) CO2 conversion catalysed by the enzyme; iii) carbon distribution among CO2, HCO3 , CO3 -as a function of the pH; iv) the metal ion source to sequester carbonate. The enzyme can be made available as dissolved or confined. The latter solution is pursued for process intensification because it allows to increase the enzyme load of the reactor by immobilization on solid carriers or on membranes \u2013 then to increase the specific potentiality of the absorption unit. The selection criterion of the water stream must take into account the following issues: a) the buffering capacity of the liquid phase; b) the metal source to form carbonates; c) the required mass flow rate. The pH of the absorbing liquid phase has to be high enough to increase the CO2 absorption capacity of the aqueous stream [1]. Bond et al. [2] assessed the activity of CA in a synthetic seawater. They pointed out that the effects of ionic species, high salinity, sulphates and nitrates \u2013 transported from the flue gas \u2013 on enzymes activity was negligible. Mirjafari et al. [3] reported a study adopting synthetic brines in lab-scale batch devices. They showed that the carbonate precipitation rate in the presence of the enzymes increased provided constant pH that guarantees high carbonate ion fraction in the solution. Favre et al. [4] highlighted the synergistic effects of the CA and the buffer system: the enhancement of hydration rate due to the adoption of the enzyme must be properly offset by the action of the buffer, if this is not the case exceeding catalysts activity leads to the reduction of solid carbonate formation rate. A rough assessment of the mass flow rate of the metal ion bearing water was reported by Bond et al. [2]. Given a typical flue gas stream from coal fired power plant (300 MW(e)), the stoichiometric calcium request is satisfied by 18 10 6 tonseawater/day (one order of magnitude larger than the cooling water of the same plant).", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "9890a73ba144c5e0f3f23898e493920ac75165be", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3125175977", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.202011894", "CorpusId": 234609857}, "title": "Numerical Simulation of Relative Permeability Hysteresis Effect on Performance of CO2 Storage in Deep Saline Aquifers", "abstract": "Summary Emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere from various industrial resources, accounts for most of greenhouse gases ( Gershenzon et al. 2017 ).

In oxy-combustion, CH4/0 2/CO 2 mixtures burn at low temperatures (~1700 K), high pressures (~40 bar), where laminar burning velocities are about 7 times lower than in traditional CH4 /Air mixtures. Thus oxy-fuel combustors are more prone to blowoff and dynamic instabilities. In this thesis we examine turbulent oxy-combustion flame stabilization physics at the large and small scales using experimental studies and numerical simulations. Experimental measurements are used to establish the stability characteristics of flame macrostructures in a swirl stabilized combustor. We show that the transition in the flame macrostructure to a flame stabilized along both the inner and outer shear layers (Flame IV), scales according to the extinction strain rate, similar to air flames. To achieve accurate scaling, extinction strain rates must be computed at the thermal conditions of the outer shear layer, emphasizing the role of heat interactions with the wall boundary layer. Care must be exercised while modeling the chemical structure of oxy-flames. We show that the kinetics of CO2 (used as a diluent in oxycombustion) is important in determining the consumption speed and flame extinction strain rate. Specifically, the extinction strain rate was found to be heavily impacted by the reaction C02+ H CO + OH. Large Eddy Simulations (LES) models, first validated for various combustor geometries, fuels and oxidizers, are used to examine the stabilization mechanisms of these flames. First, we demonstrate the importance of choosing the correct global chemical kinetics mechanism in predicting the flow structures in multi-dimensional simulations and develop a priori criterion of selecting a reduced mechanism based on the extinction strain rate. Besides flame macrostructures, recirculation zone lengths are found to linearly scale with extinction strain rates. This scaling holds regardless of fuel or oxidizer type, Reynold's number, inlet temperature, or combustor geometry. It is thus very important that a chemical mechanism is able to correctly predict extinction strain rates if it is to be used in CFD simulations. We use the validated LES 3 framework to model the transition to Flame IV in the swirl combustor for methane oxy-combustion mixtures. The 3D turbulent flame structure strongly resembles a ID strained adiabatic laminar flame structure in the combustor interior, and nonadiabatic flames near the combustor wall. The results support the earlier conclusions regarding the use of the extinction strain rate and the wall thermal boundary condition in scaling and modeling turbulent combustion dynamics.

Among all fossil fuels, coal, used in nearly 40% of the world\u2019s power production, when combusted, releases several other harmful pollutants such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), mercury, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), lead and arsenic. In modern coal power plants, as required by regulations that are common in the OECD, these harmful chemicals and heavy metals must be removed from the flue gas using various pollution control technologies. However, these regulations do not govern the emissions of CO2 since CO2 does not contribute to local pollution and happens to be the inevitable and most stable oxidation product of any hydrocarbon. It is well known that the energy sector is contributing to a significant rise in the concentration of \natmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs) that cause more heat to be absorbed by the Earth than is radiated back out into space. It is estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that the concentration of GHGs is going to reach dangerous levels if future GHG emissions from the energy sector are not significantly reduced. Several models, for example, the International Energy Agency\u2019s Energy Technology Perspectives model, show that the energy sector cannot achieve a safe level of emissions unless coal use is almost entirely curtained or if CO2 is separated from the coal power plant instead of being emitted into the atmosphere and the CO2 stored in \ndeep reservoirs or otherwise used. Since Turkey has huge domestic coal reserves, coal power is a source of electricity that can contribute to Turkey\u2019s energy security. While Turkey\u2019s emissions of CO2 are small compared to those of other developing countries such as China and India, the rest of Europe or the United States, international agreements like the Paris Accord aim to achieve a world-wide collective effort from all countries. Consequently, carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) could be important to Turkey given Turkey\u2019s large coal reserves and desire to use domestic energy resources as a source of energy security and to reduce its energy import bill. CCUS is the set of methods and technologies that removes CO2 from the emissions and prevents them from leaking into the atmosphere. In this study, we focus on the application of aqueous Monoethanolamine (MEA) scrubbing method as a well-proven carbon capture (CC) technology on the Turkish coal-fired power plants. We investigate the economic and environmental impacts of MEA scrubbing technology in the context of the \nTurkish energy market. For the sake of completeness, we consider nine storage candidates, one domestic CO2-enhanced oil recovery in Batman, and an emissions trading market.

Abundant use of fossil fuels has become a cause of concern due to their adverse effects on the environment, particularly related to the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), a major contributor of GHG. In this context, CO2 capture and is storage or transformation gained significance in the recent research scenario. Various matured CO2 capture technologies such as amine based capture, needs high energy input, especially in desorption process and are also not sustainable in nature. Alternatively, carbonic anhydrase (CA) proved to be more efficient in capturing CO2 at faster rate and also needs less energy input for desorption process. However, utilization of the captured CO2 is more important rather than its capture, to close the carbon cycle and recycle it. In this direction, bioelectrochemical system (BES) is presenting an exciting opportunity with a possibility of simultaneous CO2 capture and biotransformation to value-added products in a sustainable way. Both microbes and enzymes were studied as catalyst in BES, though the application of enzymes is less foreseen. Present study demonstrates the biotransformation of CO2 to ethanol using a cascade of dehydrogenases [formate dehydrogenase (FateDH), formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FaldDH) and alcohol dehydrogenase (AlcDH)] together on the electrode of BES. Further to that, carbonic anhydrase (CA) was also included in the cascade and found that the product yield increased by 15% contributing to ethanol production rate of \u223c0.6 kg/m3/h along with current density of \u223c2 A/m2. When the FaldDH was excluded from the cascade also, there is no reduction in productivity of ethanol.

We conducted two computational studies with different injection pressures, using a two-phase lattice Boltzmann method for CO2 injection simulation and wave propagation simulation with a finite difference approach for evaluation of VP change. The change of capillary number associated with various injection pressures affected the CO2 displacement patterns. Viscous fingering was typical at high capillary numbers, whereas both viscous and capillary fingering were observed at low capillary numbers. We identified a difference in VP\u2013CO2 saturation relationships in these two cases; i.e., lower VP was observed in the high O2 distribution features capillary number case than at low capillary number at the same saturation. The difference in VP response to CO2 saturation is caused by CO2 distribution features. We evaluated VP with consideration of the porescale CO2 distribution. This study demonstrates that capillary number at each reservoir location (e.g., distance from injection well) should be considered to accurately estimate CO2 saturation from seismic velocity. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Biofuels can offer a pathway to significantly reduce emissions from these sectors, as they can easily substitute for conventional liquid fuels in internal combustion engines. In this paper, we assess the potential of bioenergy to reduce transport GHG emissions through an analysis leveraging various integrated assessment models and scenarios, as part of the 33rd Energy Modeling Forum study (EMF-33). We find that bioenergy can contribute a significant, albeit not dominant, proportion of energy supply to the future transport sector: in scenarios aiming to keep the temperature increase below 2 \u00b0C by the end of the twenty-first century, models project that in 2100 bioenergy can provide on average 42 EJ/yr (ranging from 5 to 85 EJ/yr) for transport (compared to 3.7 EJ in 2018), mainly through lignocellulosic fuels. This makes up 9\u201362% of final transport energy use. Only a small amount of bioenergy is projected to be used in transport through electricity and hydrogen pathways, with a larger role for biofuels in road passenger transport than in freight. The association of carbon capture and storage (CCS) with bioenergy technologies (BECCS) is a key determinant in the role of biofuels in transport, because of the competition for biomass feedstock to provide other final energy carriers along with carbon removal. Among models that consider CCS in the biofuel conversion process the average market share of biofuels is 21% in 2100 (ranging from 2 to 44%), compared to 10% (0\u201330%) for models that do not. Cumulative direct emissions from the transport sector account for half of the emission budget (from 306 to 776 out of 1,000 GtCO2). However, the carbon intensity of transport decreases as much as other energy sectors in 2100 when accounting for process emissions, including carbon removal from BECCS. Lignocellulosic fuels become more attractive for transport decarbonization if BECCS is not feasible for any energy sectors.

The international scientific community, through the IPCC, concluded that action needs to be taken urgently to mitigate carbon emissions before the point of no return in carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere is reached. In that respect, carbon capture and storage (CCS) was deemed to be the most effective solution to deal with large quantities of CO2 emitted.

It is imperative to seek alternatives to underground storage. This is even more important at the present time given that no real progress was made to manage carbon emissions on a large scale despite some CCS pilot studies conducted in Algeria, Norway, Canada, Australia and USA. Our work focused on an alternative to CCS, namely carbon mineralization. This is a special form of carbon conversion that does not have the same disadvantage of energy intensity as catalytic conversion of carbon back into fuel or hydrocarbon feedstock. Our approach is based on a relatively low temperature mineralization exploiting salt in reject brines, thus potentially solving two environmental problems in one single solution. Our work is both experimental and computational and has shown that good salt and carbon conversion at around 30 C is feasible.

Therefore, the identification of innovative solutions for their mitigation is both a priority and a challenge. The integration of carbon capture and storage technologies into the industrial production process is considered among the most viable solutions for this purpose, and calcium looping (CaL) represents one of the most promising. A key research challenge points to maximize process efficiencies and minimize production cost to decouple cement production from carbon emissions. The carbon capture process proposed in this work is a looping system where CO2 is absorbed by calcium oxide (CaO) in the first reactor (carbonator) and the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) produced is regenerated in an oxy-fired calciner. During calcination, CO2 is released from the sorbents, purified, compressed, and then made available for geological storage. In this study, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to two cement production systems with CaL carbon capture are evaluated: the tail-end CaL carbon capture and the integrated CaL carbon capture. The carbon footprint is complemented with the assessment of the resources depletion mineral and elements and the demand of primary energy. An eco-design approach was pursued by carrying out a life cycle assessment to identify the environmental hotspots and which CaL integration approach presents a higher potential for cement industry decarbonization. The results of the analysis were compared with a conventional cement production process. The results show that the GHG emissions may be reduced by 74% with a tail-end approach and 71% when the CaL is fully integrated into the cement production process. When a future perspective, with higher penetration of renewable energy resources into the electricity sector, was modeled, the results showed that CaL integrated into the clinker production process is more promising in terms of reduction of the carbon footprint, rather than the tail-end solutions. Primary energy consumption from non-renewables is substantially impacted by CaL, with the integrated CaL configuration showing to be a more efficient solution because of less primary energy consumption (coal).", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "3ad12c00df9aca6921a2c7e1b446347741e9f29d", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 209438195}, "title": "OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH CO2 COMPRESSION AND TRANSPORTATION DURING CCS ACTIVITIES", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) holds the potential to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from large stationary sources. The majority of CCS research to date has focused on the capture, injection, and subsequent monitoring of the CO2 in the geologic formation, but efficient incorporation of compression into an integrated system may offer opportunities to reduce the cost of CCS, which could help to advance widespread implementation of the concept. The CO2 is transported as a supercritical fluid in pipelines during CCS activities. Because the CO2 stream exiting all CO2 capture technologies is in the gas phase, compression is required prior to pipeline transport. The choice of compression approach is based upon the power demands and investment cost. A liquefaction approach has not been proven to be more efficient or cost-effective than traditional gas compression techniques, although the shock wave-based Dresser-Rand SuperCompressor shows promise, especially for postcombustion capture. Compression plays an important role in overall CO2 capture plant efficiency. Selection of an appropriate compression approach for the quantity of CO2, desired pipeline pressure, and type of capture technology is crucial.

Greenhouse gases are considered to cause this phenomenon. Carbon dioxide has low global warming potential (GWP, 1.0) compared to other greenhouse gases such as CH4, HFCs. But because it occupies about 76 % of emitted greenhouse gases and is considered to be controllable through many methods, CO2 is classified as an important greenhouse gas. Much interest has been given to CCS (Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage or Sequestration) as a step to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. At first, carbon dioxide should be captured with many impurities from the flue gas of some large plants, such as a power plant, a steel mill etc. After that, impurities should be removed from the captured gas. Then the concentration of this purified flue gas is 99.5 mol % CO2, and 0.5 mol% N2. This purified flue gas is called CO2 mixture from now on. CO2 mixture should be delivered in critical fluid state or liquid state to reduce the transferred volume to the prepared storage place such as saline-aquifer storage, oil reservoir etc.. Then CO2 mixture should be injected to the storage using pumps. A series of these processes is called CCS. When the distance from the start point to the storage is over 1,000 km, the transfer using a ship is reported to be more economical than the one using pipelines. Because Korea and Japan emits large amount of CO2 compared to the small territory, and are enclosed by sea, they have to secure some oversea storage place and use the delivery system of CO2 mixture using a ship. To be transferred by ship CO2 mixture should be liquefied. For this liquefaction processes of CO2 were studied. Considering the impurities in CO2 mixture, the operating conditions for the CO2 mixture storage tank of a ship could be summarized roughly into two cases, 8 bar, equilibrium temperature (low pressure conditions) or 20 bar, equilibrium temperature (high pressure conditions). In this study, 8 bar, equilibrium temperature was chosen as the operating conditions for LCO2 storage tanks considering realization. A ship has 50,000 m storage capacity.

This study provides a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) methodology for the pore-scale displacement mechanism of supercritical CO2 under different wetting conditions and quantify the effect of wettability and direction of flow on supercritical CO2 trapping.\n A 3-Dimensional visualization software is used to build surface mesh from the micro-pores of the Bentheimer sandstone. A module of a commercial CFD software is used to generate volume mesh from the surface mesh and another module from the same CFD software is used to perform imbibition processes (supercritical CO2/brine) through the Bentheimer sandstone. Full Navier-Stokes equations are solved by using Eulerian-Eulerian multiphase transient flow approach. Free surface flow model is used to integrate the effect of capillary forces. This model determines the pressure gradient at the two-phase interface. The flow is assumed to be laminar, isothermal and there is no mass transfer between phases.\n The initial condition of the imbibition processes was obtained from a drainage process for a strongly water-wet system. For this, a Bentheimer sandstone was completely filled with brine and supercritical CO2 was injected. The simulation was stopped when brine was drained by supercritical CO2 and the system reached the steady state conditions. This phase distribution was used as an initial boundary condition for the imbibition processes. The imbibition processes were performed in two opposite direction for different contact angles (100\u00b0 and 110\u00b0). The effect of wettability and direction of brine on supercritical CO2 trapping were observed. The residual saturation of supercritical CO2 was significantly different in two opposite direction of brine flow. In the reverse imbibition process, normalized residual supercritical CO2 saturation values are increased but, the amount of normalized trapped supercritical CO2 values are decreased. It was mainly due to the amount of normalized free supercritical CO2 saturation values (which were equal to the difference between normalized residual supercritical CO2 saturation and normalized free supercritical CO2 saturation values).", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "b4ee7bf23050c3ffddf51baa7030ca112751064b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2268528276", "CorpusId": 130644183}, "title": "Carbon capture and storage in the power sector of Portugal and Spain", "abstract": "Portugal and Spain are still relying heavily in fossil fuels.

Due to the high dependency of Portugal\u2019s and Spain\u2019s power sector on fossil fuels, the related CO2 emissions of this sector are very high.

The experiments were carried out via ex-situ process (direct carbonation), by both gas-solid carbonation (dry capture) and aqueous carbonation (wet capture) which involves the reaction of CO2 with alkaline elements. The experiments were conducted in a stainless steel reactor at varying pressures (1, 2 and 5 bar) and reaction time (15 min to 3 h) at room temperature. The carbonated product obtained was analysed in TOC analyser in order to evaluate the net carbon increase. From the experiments and studies carried out it was inferred that net carbon increase obtained in wet capture was double the amount of carbonation in comparison with dry capture. Thus CKD readily sequesters CO2 under optimized conditions.

Since the 1750s, fossil fuels \u2014 coal, then oil, then methane gas \u2014 have succeeded one another in providing dense energy storage in portable, easily extractable and cheap forms. However effi ciently these fossil fuels, or indeed biomass, are used in combustion, or are transferred to different energy vectors such as hydrogen, or used in petrochemical products, the fossil or biological carbon ultimately emitted into the atmosphere is still carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). It is clear, fi rst, that this increased rate of CO 2 emission instigated by industrialisation has produced increased atmospheric CO 2 content, leading to global warming and climate change. Secondly, the dissolution of increased CO 2 from the atmosphere into the upper ocean is producing a measurable increase in the acidity of ocean water. One solution to this dilemma of cheap energy, combined with undesirable CO 2 emissions, is to invent, perfect and deploy the suite of technologies collectively known as carbon capture and storage (CCS). The aim of such an exercise is to apply technological solutions that can either capture the carbon before combustion, with the fossil fuel, or recapture the carbon after combustion of fossil fuel. Once captured, purifi ed and compressed into a liquid state, this CO 2 can be transported for tens, hundreds or even thousands of kilometres by a truck, train, pipeline or pressurised ocean tanker. Sites of underground geology can be identifi ed using known geological principles, and the liquid CO 2 can be injected deep below ground into microscopic pore space. This can occur in a variety of subsurface geological contexts, ranging from enhancement of oil recovery, to pressurised refi lling of depleted oilor gas-fi elds, to displacing ambient pore water in deep saline formations. Once in place, the environmental requirement is that CO 2 should remain stored deep below ground for tens of thousands of years into the future. 1 This will reduce the excess rate, and total mass, of fossil carbon emission,", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "e8d699bf88fb716f6edce57152c2f7da84671811", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 40456892}, "title": "porous carbon materials generated via conjugated microporous polymer precursors for CO 2 capture and energy storage \u2020", "abstract": "Heteroatom doping and well-tuned porosity are regarded as two important factors of porous carbon materials (PCMs) for various applications.

From a purely cynical point of view, I could make the argument that the debate is already over, as it is largely political, it doesn\u2019t matter what we think, we are stuck with results that can significantly impact our industries, and we should do what we can to minimize the damage. However, I prefer to look at this more as an opportunity, a way to advance our social license, and as a series of technical issues that members of SPE are uniquely qualified to address.\n Since the first commercial CO2 project in Scurry County, Texas, in 1972, more than 150 additional CO2 EOR projects have been put in place worldwide. These projects initially depended on natural CO2 and were located near three large natural CO2 resources: McElmo Dome in Colorado, Bravo Dome in New Mexico, and Jackson Dome in Mississippi. More than 100 current CO2 EOR projects are located in the Permian Basin and Gulf Coast as a result. These projects were not initiated to save the planet or to sequester CO2; they were created by brilliant engineers and scientists trying to squeeze additional resources from declining reservoirs, and they continued because they were economical and extended the lives of fields.\n CO2 EOR in miscible or near-miscible floods can revitalize mature fields, with a typical tertiary response on the order of the secondary recovery efforts in both duration and volumes. In the past, projects have been limited by chemistry, CO2 supply, and infrastructure. According to a report by the US Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, only about 3\u20134% of potential US CO2 EOR sites\u2014that is, those with proper pressure, temperature, and permeability for miscible flooding\u2014are currently under flood. The remaining sites are awaiting available CO2, and, perhaps more importantly, favorable economics compared to other investment opportunities, such as unconventionals, where Permian shale oil is being produced for as low as $25\u00a0per barrel.\n Over 1 Bcf of natural CO2 is injected into the Permian Basin every day, and estimates are that between 800 million and 1 billion metric tons of CO2 have been stored during the past 45 years of CO2 EOR development in the region, more or less incidentally to the primary goal of producing incremental oil.

Coal deposits considered to be non-exploitable for technical or economic reasons are proven to be of major importance for the storage of CO2 captured from industrial burning installations because coal is characterized by the existence of large volumes of micropores inside which are able to physically absorb various gases, one tone of coal containing even more than 25 m of absorbed methane, and at the same time it being characterized by higher affinity for carbon dioxide gas than for methane. Because the capture, processing and transport of carbon dioxide are technically resolved, the paper is focused mainly in the issue of storage, and the joint process of methane gas replacement and its boosted delivery from coal seams. In both these processes, the main issue is the adsorption /desorption capability of the coal versus CO2 and CH4, on which basis the in place methane amount and the carbon dioxide storing capacity can be calculated.

The primary objective is to separate CO2 from water vapour and nitrogen exhaust streams of combustion industries by using established techniques, such as chemical absorption (amine scrubbing), physical adsorption, and cryogenic distillation. While these techniques are already very well established on the market for other applications, their disadvantages in terms of energy and reagent consumption has promoted the use of alternative technical solutions, like membrane based CO2 capture. Poly(ionic liquids) (PILs) represent a group of innovative polymers with high affinity for CO2 molecules that may exhibit facilitated transport properties. They have been successfully employed in membrane contactors as substitutes for CO2 sorbents like amine solutions and ionic liquids (IL). PILs are mostly synthesised from IL monomers to overcome the restrictions of ILs liquid state of matter by polymerisation. This method allows the production of tailor made PILs with desirable properties. However, their mechanical properties are often impaired by low molecular chain length of the polymeric backbone. Alternatives suggest to incorporate the ILs in the form of IL pendants in the polymeric chain of already available polymers with well established polymeric structure and known mechanical properties. Although the synthetic changes in the polymer chains might affect their mechanical parameters, it seems to be more realistic to find a compromise between improved separation performance of PILs and process-ability of commercial polymeric precursors. This work extends the family of polymer derived PILs by exploring various synthetic possibilities for IL pendant incorporation. PIL synthesis were conducted on a variety of commercially available polymers, e.g. cellulose acetate, poly(vinylbenzyl) chloride, poly(diallyldimethyl chloride), used as parent materials. This polymer choice allowed the investigation of the polymeric backbone influence on the properties of the derived PILs. Also, the synthetic composition of ILs was diversified to produce pure and mixed PILs that might intensify the interactions between the pendants on intra- and intermolecular level within the polymeric matrix. The IL pendants contained functional groups that could exhibit hydrogen bonding interactions and affect the CO2 transport mechanism. These aspects are thought to affect positively the solubility of CO2 molecules in the PIL matrix and contribute to their preferential transport across the selective layer. As the gas transport also depends on the diffusion of CO2 molecules, the polymer matrix structure plays a crucial role in the membrane separation performance. Since PILs are polymers in solid-like state, the gas diffusion is restricted by their molecular dynamics. This restriction may be circumvented by decreasing the glass transition temperature of PILs, and therefore affecting the viscoelastic properties of the material. To do so, PILs were diluted with ILs having a lower viscosity by physical blending. Additionally, the effect of metal salt additives was studied to further facilitate interactions between the PIL matrix and permeating CO2 molecules. The synthesised PILs and PIL/additive blends underwent a thorough characterisation defining their properties from bulk polymer phase to thin-film composite (TFC) membranes. This multifaceted investigation established the link between the intrinsic properties of PILs with their separation performance by combining the results obtained in gas sorption, time-lag, and mixed-gas permeation tests. The latter, conducted in sweep mode with humidified feed, allowed the assessment of industrially relevant conditions for flue gas CO2 capture. Upon incorporation of IL pendants into the polymer backbone, the PIL separation performance improved in the majority of cases studied. The PIL CO2/N2 selectivity improved most when the IL pendant exhibited ability for hydrogen bonding, as the solubility of CO2 was affected. In addition, all PIL-based membranes showed enhanced CO2 permeances in mixed-gas tests with humidified feed, confirming their viability for industrially relevant applications. In general, the PIL-based TFC membranes fully exposed their potential as CO2 selective materials. Their versatility and ease of processing ensure the possibility for commercialisation once the optimisation of the large-scale employment is investigated. Initial assessment of their commercial value provides essential prospects for PILs to become established as a new generation of commercial polymer-based materials for CO2 capture.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "6daa3a55869f05ca839b5c0b3c6695d2c1dce2c1", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 174796828}, "title": "Planning a carbon capture and storage pilot project in Australia \u2013 challenges and approaches", "abstract": "s only A.

Global mean temperature is already 1C above the 1850-1900 (pre-industrial) baseline. Many land and sea ecosystems and associated services have already changed due to global warming. Stabilising the climate at around 1.5C, the target preferred in Paris at COP21 in 2015, will depend on the intensity, promptness and effectiveness of interventions. The IPCC argues that to restrict warming to 1.5C, carbon dioxide emissions should be reduced to almost zero by 2050. Pathways modelled to achieve this show coal use for electricity needs to phase right out, and renewables would need to supply 70 to 85 per cent of electricity. For Australia, an immediate challenge is how to deal with its most significant emitter and shut down up to 12 coal-fired power stations by 2030 (i.e. in 12 years) (Slezak 2018). Some of these are already programmed for closure and others would be within five years of life span in any event (Slezak 2018). This requires progress in technology and affordability for storage of renewably-produced power (Hundloe and Hartzer 2018), an economic opportunity for Australia given the extent of lithium produced in Western Australia (IPCC 2018, chapter 4). While a transition away from coal has opportunities for alternative power sources, it also has implications for job losses in the energy and mining sectors with major impacts on our regional communities. It will require an orderly timetable and thoughtfully considered investment in transitions. The Report is a dire warning that if the world does not decrease carbon emissions seriously and rapidly, we will not be able to avoid the far more serious impacts on the planet\u2019s liveability of a 2C rise in global mean temperature. This must be coupled with increased carbon dioxide removal, through the familiar afforestation and reforestation, soil carbon sequestration, and new technologies such as direct air carbon capture and storage. The higher the temperature rise, the greater the repercussions in the form of higher sea level rise, intense storms, heavy precipitation, extreme heat, droughts and ocean acidification, all concerns for Australia, and some for New Zealand. Global impacts include health, food security, water supply, and irreversible impacts on ecosystems. Multiple inter-related climate risks will become more evident as global temperatures rise. For example hotter, drier climates and water stress will increase the level of risk from bushfires, contributing further CO2 2 , and causing loss of vegetation badly needed to sequester carbon (Gibbons 2013).

They tend instead to discuss appropriate standards for tort liability when disputes arise\u2014for example when artificial fissures from a frac treatment extend into and drain oil or gas from a neighbor\u2019s land. The case law and literature generally approach unauthorized subterranean invasions as trespasses. Because the tort of trespass is designed to protect possession, its application indicates a view of subsurface property as possessory (or corporeal) in nature. Despite calling subsurface invasions \u201ctrespasses,\u201d courts rarely impose liability for, or enjoin, invasions themselves. They instead find liability only for interferences with existing or foreseeable uses of the affected land. Leading scholars likewise advocate for a standard of subsurface \u201ctrespass\u201d that would privilege encroachments that are societally valuable, and award compensation only for resulting harm to existing uses of the property. The cases and literature thus nominally apply trespass but modify the tort from a property rule into a liability rule resembling the tort of nuisance. This Article is the first to examine unauthorized subsurface encroachments as nuisances, rather than trespasses, and to assert that such encroachments do not implicate possession.

It is found that optical readout techniques are used extensively in applications using probes; however, the very demanding application probe storage is not amongst them. Optical readout of probes offers reliability, high-speed, low noise and low complexity. It has to be extended to operation on arrays of probes for successful implementation in probe storage. \nThe first technique that is developed in this work is parallel frequency readout of an array of cantilever probes, demonstrated using optical beam deflection with a single laser-diode pair. Multi-frequency addressing makes the individual nanomechanical response of each cantilever distinguishable within the received signal. Addressing is accomplished by exciting the array with the sum of all cantilever resonant frequencies.This technique requires considerably less hardware compared to other parallel optical readout techniques. Readout is demonstrated in beam deflectionmode and interferencemode. Many cantilevers can be readout in parallel, limited by the oscillators\u2019 quality factor and available bandwidth. The proposed technique facilitates parallelism in applications at the nanoscale, including probebased data storage and biological sensing. \nA second technique to perform parallel optical readout of probes makes use of diffraction patterns that result if a laser spot is incident on an array of probes. The cantilevers form an optical grating and the state of deflection of each cantilever within the array determines the diffraction pattern, which is captured by a 1-dimensional array of photodiodes. Each cantilever can be regarded as a slit in a traditional multiple-slit diffraction experiment. In our situation the phase of the \nreflected light is a function of the amount of deflection of the cantilever, in contrast to a slit diffraction experiment, where the slits are assumed to contain light sources \nof equal phase. The developed technique is straightforward applicable when two \ndiscrete levels are permitted in cantilever bending. \nAnovel fabrication process is developed to produce probe arrayswith sharp tips \nthat are self-aligned on the cantilever.The focus is on achieving an array that gives rise to a highly uniform tip-medium distance. In order to accomplish this we make use of a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer and define the tips by a highly uniform wet chemical etch. The fabricated micro-cantilever arrays are characterized and shown to have a high uniformity. For an array of 10 cantilevers spanning 430 \u00b5m a standard error of 11 nm is demonstrated. Furthermore, we show that it is possible \nto fabricate both cantilevers and tips using a single mask. \nThee final part of this work is about scanning probe microscopy employing conductive probes, which is a powerful tool for the investigation and modification of electrical properties at the nanoscale. Application areas include semiconductormetrology, \nprobe-based data storage and materials research. Conductive probes can \nalso be used to emulate nanoscale electrical contacts. Unreliable electrical contact and tipwear have, however, severely hampered thewide-spread usage of conductive probes. In this work we introduce a forcemodulation technique for enhanced nanoscale electrical sensing using conductive probes. This technique results in lower friction, reduced tip wear and enhanced electrical contact quality. Experimental results using phase-changematerial stacks and platinum silicide conductive probes clearly demonstrate the efficacy of this technique.

Also, some properties of CO2 will change with pressure and temperature and generally speaking, the injected CO2 would be in a dense, supercritical phase in geologic sink. CO2 geological storage can happen through different mechanismsSolubility Trapping; Hydrodynamic Trapping; Chemical Trapping. The CO2 storage capacity and injectivity can be evaluated through different methods based on different types of storage site.

Deep saline aquifers are believed to have the most potential to storage CO2 but further studies have to be performed to evaluate the capacity and injectivity. Several case studies are shown about CO2 storage capacity and injectivity. CO2 leakage mechanisms determinate how CO2 leaks form the geological sinks. Wells, consisting of different components, may provide the leakage pathways for CO2. CO2/Brine surface dissolution is a useful strategy which can increase the CO2 storage efficiency.

In carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the mineral carbonation process causes CO2 to react with particular metals or compounds to stably fix CO2. Many relevant studies have been performed on this capture process. Based on research describing photosynthetic bacteria that fix CO2 in the process of producing H2 under light irritation, this study combines ceramics with photosynthetic bacteria to develop a material capable of reducing environmental CO2. To investigate the possible combinations this study conducted experiments on ceramic materials of hardened cement pastes and lightweight aggregates made using waste from the Korean Y power plant. The photosynthetic bacteria Rhodopseudomonas pentothenatexigens AE8-5 was used and cultivated in a standard culturing medium. To examine the CO2 reduction rate, a 165 mL sealable glass bottle was used and CO2 was injected through the rubber lid using a syringe. Ceramic specimens were placed in the medium with the photosynthetic bacteria, and then were cultured in a shaking incubator at 25-30\u00b0C, a pH of 7, 6000 lux irradiation, and a shaking rate of 120 RPM. After the injection of the bacteria, gas chromatography-thermal conductivity detection analysis was performed on the gases in the bottles, and the presence of CO2 was confirmed. When 30 g of the ceramic aggregate with a low reaction rate with CO2 was used and the photosynthetic bacteria were irradiated, the CO2 concentration was reduced by ~40%. It is necessary to address the amount of ceramic material used and the shaking friction generated in order for uniform light irradiation when the ceramic is combined with photosynthetic bacteria. The results demonstrated that materials combining photosynthetic bacteria and ceramic are applicable for future studies.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "d96f8b3f647611b5b8dc233a76c5f4954956c3e6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3091685870", "DOI": "10.1007/s10450-020-00246-z", "CorpusId": 221985621}, "title": "Value added utilization of ferronickel slags as raw materials of 4A zeolite for CO2 reduction", "abstract": "The scale of smelting ferronickel by RKEF (Rotary kiln\u2014electric furnace) process is increasing these years, these untreated ferronickel slags will occupy a large area as accumulation and cause ecological damage. On the other hand, the CO2 emission and global warming are urgent problems to be solved as they have resulted in severe climate change. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technology is considered as a feasible solution to the problem of excessive CO2 emissions, and the key of the CCS is the exploration for adsorbents which are low-cost, efficient and energy saving. We found that it is viable to use ferronickel slag as raw material to synthesize 4A zeolite. Further improvement for the purities of 4A zeolite was also accomplished by optimizing the synthesis conditions via single factor experiments. The as-synthesized sample was characterized in terms of structural morphology, chemical composition and surface properties. The adsorption and adsorption kinetics properties were investigated by thermal gravimetric analyzer and four models, respectively. The results indicated that 4A zeolite has a great performance in the adsorption and separation of CO2/N2 with the high value-added utilization of ferronickel slags which conducts.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "969bae452d81e97fe8d1c1e921f7e1d2e1475d7e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2017012380", "DOI": "10.1002/ghg.1281", "CorpusId": 108517166}, "title": "Is CCS a fully fledged business proposition or an interesting experiment", "abstract": "As delegates have been meeting for the first carbon capture and storage (CCS) conferences of 2012, the theme that seems to have emerged in the early stages of this year is: what next for CCS?
