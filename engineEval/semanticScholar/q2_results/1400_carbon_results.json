However, the carbon uptake potential in land\u2010based climate change mitigation efforts is highly uncertain. Here, we address this uncertainty by using two land\u2010based mitigation scenarios from two land\u2010use models (IMAGE and MAgPIE) as input to four dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs; LPJ\u2010GUESS, ORCHIDEE, JULES, LPJmL). Each of the four combinations of land\u2010use models and mitigation scenarios aimed for a cumulative carbon uptake of ~130 GtC by the end of the century, achieved either via the cultivation of bioenergy crops combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or avoided deforestation and afforestation (ADAFF). Results suggest large uncertainty in simulated future land demand and carbon uptake rates, depending on the assumptions related to land use and land management in the models. Total cumulative carbon uptake in the DGVMs is highly variable across mitigation scenarios, ranging between 19 and 130 GtC by year 2099. Only one out of the 16 combinations of mitigation scenarios and DGVMs achieves an equivalent or higher carbon uptake than achieved in the land\u2010use models. The large differences in carbon uptake between the DGVMs and their discrepancy against the carbon uptake in IMAGE and MAgPIE are mainly due to different model assumptions regarding bioenergy crop yields and due to the simulation of soil carbon response to land\u2010use change. Differences between land\u2010use models and DGVMs regarding forest biomass and the rate of forest regrowth also have an impact, albeit smaller, on the results. Given the low confidence in simulated carbon uptake for a given land\u2010based mitigation scenario, and that negative emissions simulated by the DGVMs are typically lower than assumed in scenarios consistent with the 2\u00b0C target, relying on negative emissions to mitigate climate change is a highly uncertain strategy.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "fce28d6c1fcd6caf2f43f5c7bd41d2346f62eef4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2065060777", "DOI": "10.1016/J.EGYPRO.2014.11.761", "CorpusId": 110445717}, "title": "A Review of Existing Carbon Capture and Storage Cluster Projects and Future Opportunities", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "adc32464613af01acf2df257810a3f45db320dd2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2605488857", "DOI": "10.4337/JHRE.2017.02.02", "CorpusId": 152267048}, "title": "Climate dreaming: negative emissions, risk transfer, and irreversibility", "abstract": "The Integrated Assessment Models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change rely heavily on negative emissions technologies [NETs] for scenarios that keep global temperature rise to 2\u00b0 C or lower.

The accumulation of carbon storage compounds by many unicellular algae after nutrient deprivation occurs despite declines in their photosynthetic apparatus. To understand the regulation and roles of photosynthesis during this potentially bioenergetically valuable process, we analyzed photosynthetic structure and function after nitrogen deprivation in the model alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolite, and lipid profiling and microscopic time course data were combined with multiple measures of photosynthetic function. Levels of transcripts and proteins of photosystems I and II and most antenna genes fell with differing trajectories; thylakoid membrane lipid levels decreased, while their proportions remained similar and thylakoid membrane organization appeared to be preserved. Cellular chlorophyll (Chl) content decreased more than 2-fold within 24 h, and we conclude from transcript protein and 13C labeling rates that Chl synthesis was down-regulated both pre- and posttranslationally and that Chl levels fell because of a rapid cessation in synthesis and dilution by cellular growth rather than because of degradation. Photosynthetically driven oxygen production and the efficiency of photosystem II as well as P700+ reduction and electrochromic shift kinetics all decreased over the time course, without evidence of substantial energy overflow. The results also indicate that linear electron flow fell approximately 15% more than cyclic flow over the first 24 h.

However, rapid agricultural expansion has left these landscapes highly fragmented, calling into question their capacity to cycle and store carbon. We utilized airborne mapping approaches that revealed changes in aboveground carbon and key aspects of ecosystem structure and function in forest edges along oil palm plantations in Malaysian Borneo. We found widespread evidence of significant changes in canopy structure and foliar traits related to light capture, growth, and productivity along forest edges that corresponded to declines in aboveground carbon. These changes underpin carbon declines that varied spatially, with far-reaching implications for the conservation of forest biodiversity and carbon stocks. Nearly 20% of tropical forests are within 100 m of a nonforest edge, a consequence of rapid deforestation for agriculture. Despite widespread conversion, roughly 1.2 billion ha of tropical forest remain, constituting the largest terrestrial component of the global carbon budget. Effects of deforestation on carbon dynamics in remnant forests, and spatial variation in underlying changes in structure and function at the plant scale, remain highly uncertain. Using airborne imaging spectroscopy and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, we mapped and quantified changes in forest structure and foliar characteristics along forest/oil palm boundaries in Malaysian Borneo to understand spatial and temporal variation in the influence of edges on aboveground carbon and associated changes in ecosystem structure and function. We uncovered declines in aboveground carbon averaging 22% along edges that extended over 100 m into the forest. Aboveground carbon losses were correlated with significant reductions in canopy height and leaf mass per area and increased foliar phosphorus, three plant traits related to light capture and growth. Carbon declines amplified with edge age. Our results indicate that carbon losses along forest edges can arise from multiple, distinct effects on canopy structure and function that vary with edge age and environmental conditions, pointing to a need for consideration of differences in ecosystem sensitivity when developing land-use and conservation strategies.

At present CCS is the only technological solution that has the potential to substantially reduce carbon emissions from fossil fuel fired power plants and other large-scale industrial processes. The ultimate goal of CCS is to store the otherwise emitted CO2 for geological times in the deep underground. By reaching its goal CCS can significantly cut back CO2 emissions from burning carbon-containing fuels which may dominate the primary energy supply until at least the middle of the 21st century. Despite the acknowledged urgency to demonstrate CCS technologies and the increasing amount of funding available, no fully integrated power plants with CCS have yet been built at commercial scale. The pattern of difficulty at the demonstration phase, whereby new technologies fail to negotiate the various market and institutional barriers that confront them, is often manifested in multifaceted, capital-intensive technologies, like CCS. If this part of the innovation process is not well managed, either by policy makers or industries, this might lead to the development of technologies that do not match market demands or the absence of technological innovation altogether. On the other hand if the innovation process is well understood, it may allow for shaping and accelerating the development and deployment of emerging technologies. This thesis is centred around the question of how to accelerate the development and deployment of CCS technologies, using a multi-disciplinary research focus. After all, the innovation process is not only influenced by technological characteristics. The social-economic environment in which a technology is developed and deployed \u2013 called the \u2018Technological Innovation System (TIS)\u2019 - is deemed of great importance. A well functioning Innovation System would greatly support the final market uptake of CCS technologies. So identifying strengths and weaknesses in the present Innovation System is of crucial importance to technology managers and policy makers that wish to accelerate the innovation process. In order to do so, the research presented in this thesis applies the Innovation System Functions approach. System Functions are key processes required for an Innovation System to develop and grow and, thereby, to increase the commercial chances of the new technology. In recent scientific articles published by the Innovation Studies Group of the Utrecht University, seven functions are discerned, each covering a critical aspect of technology development, namely entrepreneurial activities, knowledge development, knowledge diffusion, guidance, market creation, resources mobilization and the creation of legitimacy. For a better understanding of the innovation processes, in this thesis the innovation systems functions are used to compare the growth and performance of CCS Innovation Systems in the United States, Canada, Norway, Australia, and of course the Netherlands.

With the new ultrasound method, applied for a patent, desorption of CO2 can be performed at temperatures below 80\u2009\u00b0C. This special feature of the ultrasonic-assisted CO2 degassing can be applied advantageously together with weakly binding CO2 absorbents which are in use in connection with a high CO2 partial pressure in the raw gas.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "e62102c1651b9bc67ad98402259b0a65d9608219", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1675969197", "CorpusId": 153376721}, "title": "Carbon sequestration options in the international climate regime", "abstract": "The present thesis deals with carbon sequestration options in the Kyoto Protocol, namely carbon sequestration in the terrestrial biosphere and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). \nChapter 2 investigates the negotiation process on Land use, Land-use change and Forestry (LULUCF) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \nIn chapter 3, market effects of the inclusion of forestry projects in the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) are examined. For this purpose, marginal carbon sequestration cost curves representing different policy scenarios are developed and incorporated into a partial equilibrium model of the international market for emission offsets. An analysis based on marginal cost curves rests upon the underlying assumption that the amount of sequestration taking place is purely determined by the sequestration potential and the respective costs. However, other factors are likely to play a significant role for CDM investment flows as well. \nTherefore, apart from the mitigation potential of a CDM host country, the analysis in chapter 4 considers the investment climate and institutional CDM capacity as well. Based on these variables, a host country classification is elaborated using cluster analysis. The resulting classification provides a first picture of what the global distribution of CDM flows might look like. \nThe subject of chapter 5 is the integration of carbon dioxide capture and storage into the international climate regime.

The thermodynamic performance of these membrane-based plants are compared with similar IGCCs that capture CO{sub 2} using conventional (i.e., solvent absorption) technology. The basic plant configuration employs an entrained-flow, oxygen-blown coal gasifier with quench cooling, followed by an adiabatic water gas shaft (WGS) reactor that converts most of CO contained in the syngas into CO{sub 2} and H{sub 2}. The syngas then enters a WGS membrane reactor where the syngas undergoes further shifting; simultaneously, H{sub 2} in the syngas permeates through the hydrogen-selective, dense metal membrane into a counter-current nitrogen 'sweep' flow. The permeated H{sub 2}, diluted by N{sub 2}, constitutes a decarbonized fuel for the combined cycle power plant whose exhaust is CO{sub 2} free. Exiting the membrane reactor is a hot, high pressure 'raffinate' stream composed primarily of CO{sub 2} and steam, but also containing 'fuel species' such as H{sub 2}S, unconverted CO, and unpermeated H{sub 2}.

The Discussion focused almost entirely on carbon capture (21 out of 23 papers) and covered all the main technology contenders for this except biological processes. It included (chemical) scientists and engineers in equal measure and the Discussion was enriched by the broad content and perspectives this brought. The major underlying theme to emerge was the essential need for closer integration of materials and process design - the use of isolated materials performance criteria in the absence of holistic process modelling for design and optimisation can be misleading. Indeed, combining process and materials simulation for reverse materials molecular engineering to achieve the required process performance and cost constraints is now within reach and is beginning to make a significant impact on optimising CCS and CCU (CO2 utilisation) processes in particular, as it is on materials science and engineering generally. Examples from the Discussion papers are used to illustrate this potential.

The process aims to capture the carbon dioxide, concentrate it and pressurize it for storage or further usage.

First, because of the high-compressibility of gas, these reservoirs have larger storage capacity than oil reservoirs or aquifers. Second, the condensate that has dropped out from the gas phase during natural depletion will re-vapourize because of re-pressurization of the reservoir and by miscibility with the injected CO2. This condensate can be recovered from producing wells and leaves more pore volume for available storage of CO2. The objective of this study is to investigate the CO2 storage capacity in different formation types, for different levels of CO2 purity and different injection schedules. To this aim, we analyzed the injection of a CO2-based stream into a depleted gas condensate reservoir and into a saline aquifer using a compositional reservoir simulation model. The dynamics of the reservoir impose a minimum period of injection that is required in order for the storage scheme to benefit from 100% of the reservoir storage capacity. Hence, over and above a certain CO2 injection rate, it becomes meaningless to invest in bigger compressors to increase this rate to reduce the time of injection. When the CO2 stream contains impurities, such as N2 or methane, the storage capacity of the reservoir decreases proportionally to the impure stream\u2019s compressibility factor and its concentration of impurities. This finding suggests that an economic optimum between the costs of separation, compression and injection can be determined. Finally, the mass of CO2 sequestrated per pore volume in the equivalent aquifer model is approximately 13 times lower that of the depleted gas condensate reservoir model. This confirms that, because of their low overall compressibility, aquifers offer a far lower ratio of CO2 stored per pore volume than depleted gas condensate reservoirs. However, aquifers tend to have a far larger extent, which often compensates somewhat for this lower ratio and therefore provides storage for significant volumes of CO2. CO2 concentration at 450 to 750 ppm (1) . CO2 capture and storage (CCS) could facilitate the achievement of stabilization goals.

As such, differently from the pure utilisation options discussed in this book, accelerated carbonation may provide an effective contribution to the reduction of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere from stationary sources. Besides, when applied to alkaline residues, it may allow for a beneficial use of these types of waste materials, thus providing a further environmental benefit.

Agroforestry is an increasingly popular farming system enabling agricultural diversification and providing several ecosystem services. In agroforestry systems, soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are generally increased, but it is difficult to disentangle the different factors responsible for this storage. Organic carbon (OC) inputs to the soil may be larger, but SOC decomposition rates may be modified owing to microclimate, physical protection, or priming effect from roots, especially at depth. We used an 18-year-old silvoarable system associating hybrid walnut trees (Juglans regia \u2009\u00d7\u2009 nigra) and durum wheat (Triticum turgidum\u00a0L. subsp. durum) and an adjacent agricultural control plot to quantify all OC inputs to the soil \u2013 leaf litter, tree fine root senescence, crop residues, and tree row herbaceous vegetation \u2013 and measured SOC stocks down to 2\u202fm of depth at varying distances from the trees. We then proposed a\u00a0model that simulates SOC dynamics in agroforestry accounting for both the whole soil profile and the lateral spatial heterogeneity. The model was calibrated to the control plot only. Measured OC inputs to soil were increased by about 40\u202f% (+ 1.11\u202ft\u2006C\u2006ha\u22121\u2006yr\u22121) down to 2\u202fm of depth in the agroforestry plot compared to the control, resulting in an additional SOC stock of 6.3\u202ft\u2006C\u2006ha\u22121 down to 1\u202fm of depth. However, most of the SOC storage occurred in the first 30\u202fcm of soil and in the tree rows. The model was strongly validated, properly describing the measured SOC stocks and distribution with depth in agroforestry tree rows and alleys. It showed that the increased inputs of fresh biomass to soil explained the observed additional SOC storage in the agroforestry plot. Moreover, only a\u00a0priming effect variant of the model was able to capture the depth distribution of SOC stocks, suggesting the priming effect as a\u00a0possible mechanism driving deep SOC dynamics. This result questions the potential of soils to store large amounts of carbon, especially at depth. Deep-rooted trees modify OC inputs to soil, a\u00a0process that deserves further study given its potential effects on SOC dynamics.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "d252d618f89f9fabe0c819705c706c12a3d479e3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1977156391", "DOI": "10.1179/1743275814Y.0000000057", "CorpusId": 129695501}, "title": "An assessment of global resources of rocks as suitable raw materials for carbon capture and storage by mineralisation", "abstract": "Abstract Carbon capture and storage by mineralisation (CCSM) is a method proposed for capturing CO2 by reacting it with magnesium in ultramafic rocks to form carbonate minerals and silica. Large quantities of magnesium silicate rocks are required for this process and to demonstrate the feasibility, and adequately plan for the development and supply of mineral resources, their locations and quantities must be known. This study attempts to globally define the spatial extent and quantity of resources that could be used for the CCSM processes and to assess, if based on resources, this could be a viable, widely applicable CO2 sequestration process. It has been estimated that around 90 teratonnes of material is available. This is sufficient to capture global CO2 emissions for over 700 years at current levels of output and highlights the enormous resource. Even if only a small part is utilised, it could make a significant impact on CO2 reduction. The majority of the resource is contained within ophiolitic rocks. The study further attempts to split CCSM resources into altered (serpentine-rich rocks) and unaltered (olivine-rich rocks) due to the different processing requirements for these rock types. Carbon capture and storage by mineralisation is likely to be of most use in areas with no access to underground geological CO2 storage or for small operations where underground storage is not practical.

This POC sinks and is respired, releasing CO2 into subsurface waters that are sequestered from the atmosphere. The depth scale over which this regeneration happens strongly affects atmospheric CO2, but estimates to date have been sparse and challenging to interpret. We use a new geochemical method to determine POC regeneration depth scales at unprecedented resolution in the South Pacific Ocean, finding shallow regeneration in both oxygen-deficient zone and oligotrophic gyre settings. Our results imply decreased future ocean carbon storage due to gyre expansion and two opposing feedbacks to expanding oxygen-deficient zones, the net effects of which on ocean carbon storage require future research. Particulate organic carbon (POC) produced in the surface ocean sinks through the water column and is respired at depth, acting as a primary vector sequestering carbon in the abyssal ocean. Atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are sensitive to the length (depth) scale over which respiration converts POC back to inorganic carbon, because shallower waters exchange with the atmosphere more rapidly than deeper ones. However, estimates of this carbon regeneration length scale and its spatiotemporal variability are limited, hindering the ability to characterize its sensitivity to environmental conditions. Here, we present a zonal section of POC fluxes at high vertical and spatial resolution from the GEOTRACES GP16 transect in the eastern tropical South Pacific, based on normalization to the radiogenic thorium isotope 230Th. We find shallower carbon regeneration length scales than previous estimates for the oligotrophic South Pacific gyre, indicating less efficient carbon transfer to the deep ocean. Carbon regeneration is strongly inhibited within suboxic waters near the Peru coast. Canonical Martin curve power laws inadequately capture POC flux profiles at suboxic stations. We instead fit these profiles using an exponential function with flux preserved at depth, finding shallow regeneration but high POC sequestration below 1,000 m. Both regeneration length scales and POC flux at depth closely track the depths at which oxygen concentrations approach zero. Our findings imply that climate warming will result in reduced ocean carbon storage due to expanding oligotrophic gyres, but opposing effects on ocean carbon storage from expanding suboxic waters will require modeling and future work to disentangle.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "4415426ddfb2a23ee10b1470f631a82fc9199c8b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1974579559", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJHYDENE.2013.01.066", "CorpusId": 94650699}, "title": "Investigation of biomass gasification hydrogen and electricity co-production with carbon dioxide capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "0c21835a12e01e5e823b99b327b461d4e51ececf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2757547538", "DOI": "10.1007/s10661-017-6246-2", "CorpusId": 27322087, "PubMed": "28948417"}, "title": "Vegetation ecology and carbon sequestration potential of shrubs in tropics of Chhattisgarh, India", "abstract": "Tropical forests are well known to have great species diversity and contribute substantial share in terrestrial carbon (C) stocks worldwide.

In the present investigation, an attempt has been made to explore the dynamics of shrub species in four fire regimes, viz. high, medium, low, and no fire zones of Bhoramdeo Wildlife Sanctuary of Kawardha forest division (Chhattisgarh), India. The variations in structure, diversity, biomass, productivity, and C sequestration potential in all the sites were quantified.

The diversity indices showed that the value of Shannon index was highest in medium fire zone (3.77) followed by high, low, and no fire zones as 3.25, 3.12, and 2.32, respectively. The value of Simpson\u2019s index or concentration of dominance (Cd) ranged from 0.08 to 0.20, species richness from 0.56 to 1.58, equitability from 1.41 to 1.44, and beta diversity from 1.50 to 4.20, respectively.

On the one hand, CDR poses a potential moral hazard: if people perceive that CDR solves climate change, they may be less likely to support efforts to reduce carbon emissions. On the other hand, the need for CDR may increase the perceived severity of climate change and, thus, increase support for other types of mitigation. Using an online survey of US adults (N\u00a0=\u00a0984), we tested these competing hypotheses by exposing participants to information about different forms of CDR. We find that learning about certain CDR strategies indirectly reduces support for mitigation policies by reducing the perceived threat of climate change. This was found to be true for participants who read about CDR in general (without mention of specific strategies), bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, or direct air capture. Furthermore, this risk compensation pattern was more pronounced among political conservatives than liberals\u2014although in some cases, was partially offset by positive direct effects. Learning about reforestation, by contrast, had no indirect effects on mitigation support through perceived threat but was found to directly increase support among conservatives.

The intricacy of simulating multiphase flow, having a large number of time steps required to study injection and post\u2010injection periods of CO 2 sequestration, a highly heterogeneous reservoir, a large number of wells, etc., will lead to a complicated reservoir model.

Recently, CO2 emission and its disposal related problems have encouraged the implementation of bioprocessing to achieve a zero waste economy for a sustainable environment.

The primary research objective is to conduct a study on life cycle assessment of the post-combustion carbon dioxide capture process based on data from SaskPower\u2019s electricity generation station at the Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan, Canada. A secondary objective of this study is to identify the life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methodology which is most suitable for the assessment of carbon dioxide capture technology integrated with the power generation system in the Canadian context.MethodsThe study takes a comparative approach by including three scenarios of carbon dioxide capture at the electricity generation station: no carbon dioxide capture (\u201cno capture\u201d), partial capture (\u201cretrofit\u201d), and fully integrated carbon dioxide capture of the entire facility (\u201ccapture\u201d).

HCl is electrochemically removed from the ocean and neutralized through reaction with silicate rocks. The increase in ocean alkalinity resulting from the removal of HCl causes atmospheric CO2 to dissolve into the ocean where it will be stored primarily as HCO3 without further acidifying the ocean. On timescales of hundreds of years or longer, some of the additional alkalinity will likely lead to precipitation or enhanced preservation of CaCO3, resulting in the permanent storage of the associated carbon, and the return of an equal amount of carbon to the atmosphere. Whereas the natural silicate weathering process is effected primarily by carbonic acid, the engineered process accelerates the weathering kinetics to industrial rates by replacing this weak acid with HCl. In the thermodynamic limit\u2014and with the appropriate silicate rocks\u2014the overall reaction is spontaneous. A range of efficiency scenarios indicates that the process should require 100\u2013400 kJ of work per mol of CO2 captured and stored for relevant timescales. The process can be powered from stranded energy sources too remote to be useful for the direct needs of population centers. It may also be useful on a regional scale for protection of coral reefs from further ocean acidification.

Within this field, a gap exists in the application of this growing body of research to the unique limitations and opportunities of a specific nation. Ireland is a small developed island nation in the EU with a unique emissions profile, as 32% of the total comes from agriculture due to the high number of cattle. In this study we aim to assess the potential capacity of terrestrial NETs options for Ireland and review the nation-specific context for their deployment. Despite the proportionally high representation of biochar and carbon capture and storage in the international NETs research, in an Irish context afforestation and bioenergy crops are much more established practices and could readily be considered in possible emission pathways that use NETs. Higher capacities were found for NETs options that are currently unavailable (direct air carbon capture and storage and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage), while options available to deploy at scale (afforestation, soil carbon management and biochar) have capacities limited by saturation of soil carbon stock and have higher risk of reversibility due to impermanence.

In CCS schemes, carbon dioxide is captured from anthropogenic sources and transported to suitable sites either for EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) or storage. Globally, the largest source of CO2 is from power generation, therefore the initial projects proposed for CCS in the UK are from power plant. There are various technologies for capturing CO2 from power stations, however the captured CO2 can contain significant amounts of impurities. The presence of the impurities in the CO2 stream has an effect on the requirements for pipeline transportation and can change such factors as the flow properties, the decompression characteristics and the solubility of water in the mixture. Although transport of CO2 by pipeline is not new technology, and has been implemented in the USA for over 30 years, the effect of these impurities is not fully understood. The UK is in the advantageous position of having natural sinks for CO2 available offshore in the North and Irish Sea, which can be used for either EOR or storage. Therefore CCS implementation in the UK will involve transport of anthropogenic carbon dioxide from power stations to offshore sinks.

The term scaling is used to describe a particular form of growth that is (i) both rapid and substantive, and (ii) occurs at multiple levels from the technical unit to the industry as a whole (e.g., from a wind turbine to total installed wind capacity). Unit and industry scaling dynamics are assessed in historical time series data on refineries, power plants (nuclear, coal, gas, wind), jet aircraft, cars and light bulbs. In those cases for which S-shaped growth is clearly evidenced, logistic function parameters are used to compare scaling across different technologies. \n \n \n \nThree broad findings emerge from the meta-analysis. Firstly, the relationship between the extent and rate of scaling at the industry level, measured in terms of cumulative total capacity, is consistent across both supply-side and end use technologies. Secondly, the relationship between scaling at the unit level and scaling at the industry level is contingent on certain technology and market characteristics. A conceptual framework with six enabling factors is developed to explain different technologies' scaling dynamics. Thirdly, there is little evidence to support a 'leapfrogging' of scaling dynamics as technologies diffuse spatially from initial to subsequent and late markets. \n \n \n \nApplications of these findings are discussed. Firstly, the historical relationships between scaling parameters at the industry level are used to validate projections of low carbon technologies in future scenarios. Despite orders of magnitude projected increases in installed capacities of nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, and renewable energy by 2100, scenarios are found to be conservative in comparison with historical scaling relationships. Reasons why are discussed. Secondly, the conceptual framework of enabling factors for industry scaling is used to illustrate policy approaches for scaling low carbon technologies in the future.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "c559d66e9ebd47b74624eed20d31dc437ee3919e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2171112296", "DOI": "10.1115/1.4006691", "CorpusId": 111361204}, "title": "Performance of a Multiple-Injection Dry Low NOx Combustor With Hydrogen-Rich Syngas Fuels", "abstract": "An oxygen-blown integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant with precombustion carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is one of the most promising means of zero-emission generation of power from coal. In an IGCC plant with CCS, hydrogen-rich syngas with a wide variation of hydrogen contents is supplied to a gas turbine. Such hydrogen-rich syngas poses a great challenge to a low NOx combustor based on premixed combustion technology, because its high flame speed, low ignition energy, and broad flammability limits can cause flashback and/or autoignition. On the contrary, a diffusion combustor suffers from the high flame temperature of syngas and the resulting high NOx emission. The authors applied a \u201cmulti-injection burner\u201d concept to a preliminary burner for hydrogen-rich syngas simulating that from IGCC with CCS. In a preliminary experiment under atmospheric pressure, the multi-injection burner worked without any flashback or any blowout. A prototype multicluster combustor based on the results of that preliminary study was made to be a dry low NOx combustor for hydrogen-rich syngas of IGCC with CCS. It was tested in experiments, which were carried out under medium pressure (0.6 MPa) using test fuels simulating syngas from IGCC with a 0% carbon capture rate, a 30% carbon capture rate, and a 50% carbon capture rate. The test fuels contained hydrogen, methane, and nitrogen, and had a hydrogen content ranging from 40% to 65%.The following conclusions were drawn from the test results: (1) the tested combustor allows the stable combustion of fuels simulating 0%, 30%, and 50% CCS, (2) a convex perforated plate swirler is effective to suppress combustion oscillation, which allows NOx emissions to be less than 10 ppm through the variation of fuel simulating 0%, 30%, and 50% CCS, (3) the extended stable combustion region and enhanced entrainment and mixing due to the convex perforated plate improves the cooling of the combustor liner metal to be less than the liner metal temperature criterion.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "799fdb3caeabfd482011d439eec34fdfb2147ea7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2308494281", "DOI": "10.1007/s10098-016-1157-4", "CorpusId": 102107939}, "title": "Capture and storage of CO2 into waste phosphogypsum: the modified Merseburg process", "abstract": "We evaluated the chemical sequestration of carbon dioxide into the phosphogypsum from the Lowveld region of South Africa.

A key parameter in reservoir simulation is relative permeability. However, mineral precipitation alters the pore structure over time, and leads correspondingly to permeability changing with time. In this study, we numerically investigate the influence of carbonate precipitation on relative permeability during CO_{2} storage. The pore spaces in rock samples were extracted by high-resolution microcomputed tomography (CT) scanned images. The fluid velocity field within the three-dimensional pore spaces was calculated by the lattice Boltzmann method, while reactive transport with calcite deposition was modeled by an advection-reaction formulation solved by the finite volume method. To increase the computational efficiency and reduce the processing time, we adopted a graphics processing unit parallel computing technique. The relative permeability of the sample rock was then calculated by a highly optimized two-phase lattice Boltzmann model. We also proposed two pore clogging models. In the first model, the clogging processes are modeled by transforming fluid nodes to solid nodes based on their precipitated mass level. In the second model, the porosity is artificially reduced by adjusting the gray scale threshold of the CT images. The developed method accurately simulates the mineralization process observed in laboratory experiment. Precipitation-induced evolution of pore structure significantly influenced the absolute permeability. The relative permeability, however, was much more influenced by pore reduction in the nonwetting phase than in the wetting phase. The output of the structural changes in pore geometry by this model could be input to CO_{2} reservoir simulators to investigate the outcome of sequestered CO_{2}.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "2a0253956fffb0e07e09d083cb002bff55a459f9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3035737375", "DOI": "10.1186/s40517-020-00173-w", "CorpusId": 219692390}, "title": "The potential of coupled carbon storage and geothermal extraction in a CO2-enhanced geothermal system: a review", "abstract": "The increasing demand for energy makes it difficult to replace fossil fuels with low-carbon energy sources in the short term, and the large amount of CO2 emitted by fossil fuel combustion increases global warming.
