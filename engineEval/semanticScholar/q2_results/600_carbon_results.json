However, the past years have shown that significant drawbacks are associated with CCS options that capture CO2 from an industrial point source or power plant and store it in a geological reservoir. Geological storage is confronted with the possibility of leakage, long-term liability issues, problems with public acceptance of onshore storage locations and limited cost-effective storage capacity in some essential regions. This paper gives a brief technical and economic assessment of a partial alternative to geological storage: carbon capture and utilisation (CCU). For this paper CCU is defined as a process whereby the CO2 molecule ends up in a new molecule. The paper discusses use of CO2 for the chemical industry, for mineral carbonation and to grow microalgae. Although these options are for the most part in the R&D phase, they offer potential for value-added applications of carbon dioxide captured from an industrial installation or power plant. In addition, the paper places them in a UK policy context and makes several internationally and UK-relevant recommendations, while exploring their potential contribution to a green economy.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "d3ac0f7d158f74208ee8e4d81b08a072a70bd565", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2040683192", "DOI": "10.1080/09644016.2011.551029", "CorpusId": 155068741}, "title": "The growth of political support for CO2 capture and storage in Norway", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has enjoyed stronger political support in Norway than in other countries. Early CCS initiatives were motivated by the challenge of reconciling relatively ambitious climate policy targets with growing emissions from Norway's offshore oil and gas operations, whose expertise and project opportunities formed the basis for these initiatives. The early start of the CCS debate created political path dependence effects, including recruitment of much of the environmental sector (government agencies and some NGOs) as CCS promoters. Paradoxically, the historical absence from Norway of fossil-based power generation also favoured CCS. Initiatives to add gas-fired generating capacity to Norway's previously emissions-free power supply created an entrenched conflict in which CCS became a politically necessary compromise. The more recent growth in political support for CCS in other countries may be explained by the fact that governments increasingly experience similar, politically difficult climate/energy policy dilemmas.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "1e559c64e4c35efbb7aa3fa1c64a14296349961f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2075129755", "DOI": "10.1049/IET-GTD.2012.0590", "CorpusId": 110865639}, "title": "Power system economic dispatch under low-carbon economy with carbon capture plants considered", "abstract": "Developing a low-carbon power system is critical and fundamental to cope with the challenges of global warming, in which the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology will play a key role.

Then a generation output model and the optimal dispatch principle of CCPs is established, which can identify how the amount of carbon captured can represent a premium payment that can offset the increase in costs caused by the reduction on power output due to the CCS. On this basis, what with the low-carbon economy factors, a economic power dispatch model under low-carbon economy with CCPs considered is proposed. With the generation fuel cost and carbon emission cost incorporated in the objective function, the model proposed can effectively evaluate the power dispatch problem under low-carbon economy.

Because of this there is interest in using carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies as a mitigation option, particularly in Australia because of its dependency on fossil fuels for electricity generation. Research in Australia into capture options includes post-combustion capture (PCC), integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) and oxyfuels combustion. Separation technologies being investigated in Australia include solvent absorption, membranes, adsorption and cryogenics, with particular emphasis on bringing down costs. Australia appears to have abundant geological storage capacity, particularly in saline formations and to a much lesser extent in depleted oil and gas fields. Storage in coal systems has potential but more research and development is needed. Australia has the opportunity to use low-emission hubs in order to bring down costs. A major study of this concept for the Latrobe Valley of Victoria, based on 50 million tonnes per annum of CO2 emissions, is encouraging. A key concept for taking CO2 capture and geological storage forward is demonstration and commercial deployment. Australian projects are proposed for PCC and oxyfuels combustion. A significant geological storage project has started in the Otway Basin, with CO2 injection scheduled to commence in mid-2007. The coal-to-liquids Monash Project could involve up to 10 million tonnes CO2 per annum, with injection into the offshore Gippsland Basin.

Blueing of the poles has increases potential for heat absorption for positive feedback but conversely the longer phytoplankton blooms have increased carbon export to storage and sequestration by shelf benthos. However, ice shelf collapses and glacier retreat can calve more icebergs, and the increased open water allows icebergs more opportunities to scour the seabed, reducing zoobenthic blue carbon capture and storage. Here the size and variability in benthic blue carbon in mega and macrobenthos was assessed in time and space at Ryder and Marguerite bays of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP). In particular the influence of the duration of primary productivity and ice scour are investigated from the shallows to typical shelf depths of 500 m. Ice scour frequency dominated influence on benthic blue carbon at 5 m, to comparable with phytoplankton duration by 25 m depth. At 500 m only phytoplankton duration was significant and influential.

These are carbon capture and sequestration/storage (CCS), enhanced hydrocarbon recovery (EHR) and carbon dioxide utilization (CDU) to produce synthetic oil. This is performed using common and comparable boundary conditions including net CO2 sequestered based on equivalent boundary conditions. This is achieved using a 'cradle to grave approach' where the final destination and fate of any product is considered. The input boundary is pure CO2 that has been produced using a post-combustion capture process as this is common between all processes. The output boundary is the emissions resulting from any product produced with the assumption that the majority of the oil will go to combustion processes. We also consider the 'cradle to gate' approach where the ultimate fate of the oil is not considered as this is a boundary condition often applied to EHR processes. Results show that while CCS can make an impact on CO2 emissions, CDU will have a comparable effect whilst generating income while EHR will ultimately increase net emissions. The global capacity for CDU is also compared against CCS using data based on current and planned CCS projects.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have been correlated with climate change, and carbon capture is essential to enable the continuing use of fossil fuels while reducing the emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere thereby mitigating global climate changes. Among the proposed methods of CO2 capture, oxyfuel combustion technology provides a promising option, which is applicable to power generation systems. This technology is based on combustion with pure oxygen (O2) instead of air, resulting in flue gas that consists mainly of CO2 and water (H2O), that latter can be separated easily via condensation, while removing other contaminants leaving pure CO2 for storage. However, fuel combustion in pure O2 results in intolerably high combustion temperatures. In order to provide the dilution effect of the absent nitrogen (N2) and to moderate the furnace/combustor temperatures, part of the flue gas is recycled back into the combustion chamber. An efficient source of O2 is required to make oxy\u2010combustion a competitive CO2 capture technology. Conventional O2 production utilizing the cryogenic distillation process is energetically expensive. Ceramic membranes made from mixed ion\u2010electronic conducting oxides have received increasing attention because of their potential to mitigate the cost of O2 production, thus helping to promote these clean energy technologies. Some effort has also been expended in using these membranes to improve the performance of the O2 separation processes by combining air separation and high\u2010temperature oxidation into a single chamber. This paper provides a review of the performance of combustors utilizing oxy\u2010fuel combustion process, materials utilized in ion\u2010transport membranes and the integration of such reactors in power cycles. The review is focused on carbon capture potential, developments of oxyfuel applications and O2 separation and combustion in membrane reactors. The recent developments in oxyfuel power cycles are discussed focusing on the main concepts of manipulating exergy flows within each cycle and the reported thermal efficiencies.

We examine the break-even value for CCS adoptions, that is, the critical value in the charge for CO2 emissions that would justify investment in CCS capabilities. Our analysis takes explicitly into account that the supply of electricity at the wholesale level (generation) is organized competitively in some U.S. jurisdictions, whereas in others a regulated utility provides integrated generation and distribution services. For either market structure, we find that emissions charges near $30 per tonne of CO2 would be the break-even value for adopting CCS capabilities at new coal-fired power plants. The corresponding break-even values for natural gas plants are substantially higher, near $60 per tonne. Our break-even estimates serve as a basis for projecting the change in electricity prices once carbon emissions become costly. CCS capabilities effectively put an upper bound on the increase in electricity prices resulting from carbon regulations, and we estimate this bound to be near 30% at the retail level for both coal and natural gas plants. In contrast to the competitive power supply scenario, however, these price increases materialize only gradually for a regulated utility. The delay in price adjustments reflects that for regulated firms the basis for setting product prices is historical cost, rather than current cost. \n \nThis paper was accepted by Gerard P.

This technology aims at capturing carbon dioxide from power stations and other industrial facilities, compressing, and then transporting it to underground storage locations. Three technological routes for carbon capture from power plants exist: pre-combustion, post-combustion and oxycombustion. Pre-combustion is the removal of the carbon element from fuel gas prior to combustion [1]. This process takes place in Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants and operates at high pressures for high concentrations of CO2. IGCC plants still face several obstacles to commercialization. For instance, only two IGCC demonstration plants are in operation in the power sector in the United States. The second option is oxy-fuel combustion, which involves the use of high purity oxygen (instead of air) for fuel combustion and produces a CO2/H2O stream from which water is easily condensed [2]. However, the air (or nitrogen-oxygen) separation step is considered a bottle-neck for this process due to its energy intensiveness and high capital and operational costs. Finally, postcombustion capture involves a highly energy intensive nitrogen-carbon dioxide separation step [3]. As an end-of-pipe technology, this process is easier to implement compared to the other capture routes. In this chapter, the focus will be placed on post-combustion capture technology due to its high maturity, ability to be retrofitted to existing power plants and operational flexibility in switching between capture and no-capture modes [4].", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "154c9f564489f3c0cf7861ac05454dc66b4f1169", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1543568639", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.1783603", "CorpusId": 16913662}, "title": "Carbon Price and Optimal Extraction of a Polluting Fossil Fuel with Restricted Carbon Capture", "abstract": "Among technological options to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, Carbon Capture and Storage technology (CCS) seems particularly promising.

We examine here a two-sector model with two primary energy resources, a polluting exhaustible resource and an expensive carbon-free renewable resource, in which an environmental regulation is imposed through a cap on the atmospheric carbon stock. We assume that only the emissions from one sector can be captured. Previous literature, based on one-sector models in which all emissions are capturable, finds that CCS technology should not be used before the threshold has been reached. We find that, when technical constraints make it impossible to capture emissions from both sectors, this result does not always hold. CCS technology should be used before the ceiling is reached if non capturable emissions are large enough. In that case, we find that energy prices paths must differ between sectors reflecting the difference of social cost of the resource according to its use.

The chain with CCS comprises post-combustion CO2 capture with monoethanolamine, compression, transport by pipeline and storage in a geological reservoir. The two reference chains represent subcritical and state-of-the-art ultra supercritical pulverized coal fired electricity generation. For the three chains we have constructed a detailed greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, and disclosed environmental trade-offs and co-benefits due to CO2 capture, transport and storage. Results show that, due to CCS, the GHG emissions per kWh are reduced substantially to 243 g/kWh. This is a reduction of 78 and 71% compared to the sub-critical and stateof-the-art power plant, respectively. The removal of CO2 is partially offset by increased GHG emissions in upand downstream processes, to a small extent (0.7 g/kWh) caused by the CCS infrastructure. An environmental co-benefit is expected following from the deeper reduction of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride emissions. Most notable environmental trade-offs are the increase in human toxicity, ozone layer depletion and fresh water ecotoxicity potential for which the CCS chain is outperformed by both other chains. The state-of-the-art power plant without CCS also shows a better score for the eutrophication, acidification and photochemical oxidation potential despite the deeper reduction of SOx and NOx in the CCS power plant. These reductions are offset by increased emissions in the life cycle due to the energy penalty and a factor five increase in NH3 emissions. # 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A recent analysis of NETs, including direct air capture, enhanced weathering, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage and afforestation/deforestation, showed that all NETs have significant limits to implementation, including economic cost, energy requirements, land use, and water use. In this paper, I assess the potential for negative emissions from soil carbon sequestration and biochar addition to land, and also the potential global impacts on land use, water, nutrients, albedo, energy and cost. Results indicate that soil carbon sequestration and biochar have useful negative emission potential (each 0.7 GtCeq. yr\u22121) and that they potentially have lower impact on land, water use, nutrients, albedo, energy requirement and cost, so have fewer disadvantages than many NETs. Limitations of soil carbon sequestration as a NET centre around issues of sink saturation and reversibility. Biochar could be implemented in combination with bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Current integrated assessment models do not represent soil carbon sequestration or biochar.

However, concerns for postcombustion applications have focused on the possible contamination of air or drinking water supplies downwind by potentially carcinogenic N-nitrosamines and N-nitramines released following their formation by NO(x) reactions with amines within the capture unit. Analytical methods for N-nitrosamines in drinking waters were adapted to measure specific N-nitrosamines and N-nitramines and total N-nitrosamines in solvent and washwater samples. The high levels of amines, aldehydes, and nitrite in these samples presented a risk for the artifactual formation of N-nitrosamines during sample storage or analysis. Application of a 30-fold molar excess of sulfamic acid to nitrite at pH 2 destroyed nitrite with no significant risk of artifactual nitrosation of amines. Analysis of aqueous morpholine solutions purged with different gas-phase NO and NO(2) concentrations indicated that N-nitrosamine formation generally exceeds N-nitramine formation. The total N-nitrosamine formation rate was at least an order of magnitude higher for the secondary amine piperazine (PZ) than for the primary amines 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and monoethanolamine (MEA) and the tertiary amine methyldiethanolamine (MDEA).

For plants with CO2 capture, we assume that the CO2 is stored in deep saline aquifers or used for enhanced oil recovery. Sustainably produced biomass is an essentially carbon-neutral energy source since the CO2 emitted from its use as energy is of recent photosynthetic origin. By capturing and storing below ground some carbon from biomass during its conversion to fuel or electricity, this biomass becomes a negative CO2-emitting energy supply. This paper summarizes and extends detailed analyses (1,2) of mass/energy balances and economics for plants that co-produce Fischer-Tropsch (FT) diesel and gasoline blendstocks plus electricity from biomass, with and without carbon capture and storage (CCS). Stand-alone biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) power generation with and without CCS is similarly analyzed. For plants with CCS, overall economics are explored assuming the CO2 is stored in deep saline aquifers or used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The feedstock is switchgrass, a perennial grass native to the Great Plains of the USA that is a promising future bioenergy crop (3,4). Methodology We use Aspen Plus software to help design the FT and IGCC plants and calculate mass/energy balances. Some equipment components in our plants are not commercially available today but can be expected to be so in the 2010-2015 timeframe. To help understand the potential for these biomass conversion systems in this timeframe and beyond, our process simulations assume that key achievable technology advances are, in fact, realized. These include feeding of switchgrass to a pressurized fluidized-bed gasifier, reliable high-efficiency oxygen-blown fluidized-bed gasification, complete tar cracking in a separate vessel following gasification, and gas cleanup to specifications for downstream synthesis or gas turbine combustion. We consider a switchgrass feed rate of 5,669 tonnes per day (20% moisture as received), or 4535 dry tonnes per day. This scale of bioenergy conversion is larger than most prior analyses have considered, although biomass processing facilities this size and larger are operating commercially today (e.g., some Brazilian sugarcane mills). When switchgrass is produced as an agricultural crop, average transport distances will be relatively modest for delivering feedstock to conversion facilities of the size we consider here. In earlier work we have shown that up to very large conversion plant sizes, the impact on overall economics of increasing average delivered feedstock costs with increasing plant sizes is more than offset by scale-economy gains in the capital cost of the larger conversion facilities (5). All plants include chopping of the switchgrass, followed by oxygen-blown fluidized-bed gasification, gas cooling and gas cleanup.

The main source of CO2 emissions is fossil fuel combustion; power generation is the single largest contributor. Coal is widely used for power generation, but it releases approximately twice as much CO2 compared with the use of natural gas for each unit of electricity sent out. Emission reduction could be achieved by increasing the efficiency with which coal is burnt, or by switching to another fuel. These measures can achieve significant reductions in emissions, but, for deep reductions, more substantial changes would be required in the power plant. The technology for capture and storage of CO2 has been recognized in recent years as providing a means of cutting emissions from fossil fuel combustion by at least 80 per cent. Capture and storage is based on technology already in use for other purposes, so there is limited need for development, and the risk of application will be less than is typical for novel energy technologies. Hence, this seems to be a technology that could be deployed relatively rapidly to reduce emissions from fossil fuel fired plant.

Limestone and gold mine wastes were recovered from mine processing sites for their use as SCM in brick-making and for evaluation of potential carbon sequestration. Dominant minerals in the limestone mine waste were calcite and akermanite (calcium silicate) while the gold mine waste was dominated by illite (iron silicate) and chlorite-serpentine (magnesium silicate). Calcium oxide, CaO and silica, SiO 2 , were the highest composition in the limestone and gold mine waste, respectively, with maximum CO 2 storage of between 7.17 and 61.37%. Greater potential for CO 2 capture was observed for limestone mine waste as due to higher CaO content alongside magnesium oxide. Mineral carbonation of the limestone mine waste was accelerated at smaller particle size of <\u200938\u00a0\u03bcm and at pH 10 as reflected by the greater carbonation efficiency. Reutilization of limestone mine waste as SCM in brick-making exhibited greater compressive strength and lower water absorption compared to the bricks made of gold mine waste. The gold mine waste is characterized as having high pozzolanic behaviour, resulting in lower carbonation potential. Therefore, it has been noticeable that limestone mine waste is a suitable feedstock for mineral carbonation process and could be reutilized as supplementary cementitious material for cement-based product.

The oxidation, via combustion, of considerable amounts of carbonaceous fuels since the dawn of the industrial revolution has led to a rapid accumulation of CO2 in the atmosphere leading to an anthropogenic influence on the Earth's climate. We highlight here that a versatile energy carrier can be produced by recycling CO2 and combining it chemically with a substance of high chemical bond energy created from renewable energy. If CO2 is taken from the atmosphere, a closed-loop production process for carbon-neutral fuels is possible providing an energy-dense and easily distributed storage medium for renewable energy. The rationale for reduced carbon or carbon-neutral energy carriers made from recycled CO2 is described, focusing on, for transport applications, their manifestation as energy-dense carbonaceous liquid fuels. Techniques for the separation of CO2 directly from the atmosphere are reviewed, and the challenges and advantages relative to flue-gas capture are discussed. Pathways for the production of carbonaceous fuels from CO2 are discussed. An integrated system is proposed where renewable energy is stored in the form of synthetic methane in the gas grid for supply to the power generation and heat sectors while methanol and drop-in hydrocarbon fuels are supplied to the transport sector. The use of atmospheric CO2 and water as feed stocks for renewable energy carriers raises the important prospect of alleviating a dependency on imported fossil energy with the associated large financial transfers. Their application in the transport sector yields a high-value end product. The synthesis and storage of carbon-neutral liquid fuels offers the possibility of decarbonizing transport without the paradigm shifts required by either electrification of the vehicle fleet or conversion to a hydrogen economy. They can be supplied either as drop-in hydrocarbon fuels for existing reciprocating and turbine-powered combustion engines or, at lower energetic cost and using simpler chemical plant, in the form of low-carbon-number alcohols which can be burned at high efficiency levels in optimized internal combustion engines.

The necessity for reducing the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is a very important issue, since CO2 is considered as a greenhouse gas causing global warming. In addition, higher concentrations of CO2 are toxic for humans, especially in space-limited chambers like submarines and space ships. Traditional technologies for CO2 capture including absorption and adsorption-coupled membrane separation along with the corresponding sorbents such as aqueous amines, microporous coordination polymers (MCPs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), different types of nitrogen-doped zeolite, mesoporous silica, and activated carbons have been widely explored. However, MCPs and ZIFs synthesized with nitrogen-containing organic compounds as the crosslinker often suffer from structural instability and inefficiency for CO2 selectivity in the presence of water and thus are limited in their widespread use. For aminemodified solids, the main drawback is the possible loss of ammonia associated with the temperature needed for regeneration and the energy-intensive nature of the regeneration process. For instance, amine-surface-modified or amineimpregnated porous silica (e.g., MCM-41, MCM-48, SBA-15, SBA-16) and zeolite 13X materials fail to capture CO2 effectively, require high temperature and long regeneration times and lack stability over many cycles. It should be pointed out that amine-modified silica-based solids are usually prepared by a post-treatment, which is a time-consuming and costly procedure and often involves the use of toxic and corrosive reagents. Porous carbon materials have many specific features such as high surface area, thermal and chemical stability, and hydrophobic surface properties. The incorporation of basic nitrogen groups into the carbon framework ensures an improved adsorption/absorption for acidic gases. Up to date, porous carbon materials used for CO2 capture were mostly prepared by post-synthetic amine modification or ammonia treatment, which again leads to materials lacking stability and, in addition, the reagents are corrosive, which brings the same disadvantages as for modified silica and zeolites.

The International Conference on Carbon Dioxide Utilization (ICCDU) provides a vibrant multi-disciplinary discussion forum for leading academics, researchers, and practitioners to showcase their recent innovations in the capture, concentration, storage, utilization, and conversion of carbon dioxide. The first edition (ICCDU-1991) of this biennial conference series took place in Japan. Since then, it has been held at various venues in Europe, Asia, and America. The one and only Singapore hosted the 13th edition (ICCDU XIII or ICCDU-2015) during July 5\u20139, 2015. The theme of ICCDU-2015 was materials, processes, and systems related to CCSU. ICCDU-2015 featured several plenary and keynote lectures by eminent speakers (including a Nobel Laureate) from around the world and a panel discussion involving academic, industry, and policy leaders from all continents. Attended by 340 delegates from 34 countries, ICCDU-2015 involved 330 oral and/or poster presentations.

Approaches involving the capture of carbon dioxide and its storage in geological formations, or in marine waters, have generated a raft of proposed solutions. The scale of some of these proposals is such that they will exert impacts of global significance in their own right. Proposals fall into two broad categories: \u2022 storage of liquid CO2 or products of reacted CO2 into intermediate/deep oceanic waters. \u2022 storage of liquid CO2 into sub-seabed or terrestrial geological formations. For the most part, while the technical feasibility of these schemata has been widely explored, the same is not true of their ecological implications. In the case of deep/intermediate oceanic waters, poor baseline understanding of the associated ecosystems is a considerable impediment to any reliable predictive assessment of likely impacts of carbon dioxide storage in these systems. Disruption of marine microbiological processes and degradation of benthic ecosystems, including those with high levels of endemicity, have been identified as potentially serious impacts. Similarly, the physiology, ecology and likely responses of micro-organisms present in targeted geological formations require evaluation prior to any consideration of the use of such formations for storage of CO2. In addition, the impacts of any leakage to surface need also to be considered.

However, efficient electrocatalysts for reducing CO2 and its derivatives into a desirable fuel are not available at present. Although many catalysts can reduce CO2 to carbon monoxide (CO), liquid fuel synthesis requires that CO is reduced further, using H2O as a H+ source. Copper (Cu) is the only known material with an appreciable CO electroreduction activity, but in bulk form its efficiency and selectivity for liquid fuel are far too low for practical use. In particular, H2O reduction to H2 outcompetes CO reduction on Cu electrodes unless extreme overpotentials are applied, at which point gaseous hydrocarbons are the major CO reduction products. Here we show that nanocrystalline Cu prepared from Cu2O (\u2018oxide-derived Cu\u2019) produces multi-carbon oxygenates (ethanol, acetate and n-propanol) with up to 57% Faraday efficiency at modest potentials (\u20130.25\u2009volts to \u20130.5\u2009volts versus the reversible hydrogen electrode) in CO-saturated alkaline H2O. By comparison, when prepared by traditional vapour condensation, Cu nanoparticles with an average crystallite size similar to that of oxide-derived copper produce nearly exclusive H2 (96% Faraday efficiency) under identical conditions. Our results demonstrate the ability to change the intrinsic catalytic properties of Cu for this notoriously difficult reaction by growing interconnected nanocrystallites from the constrained environment of an oxide lattice. The selectivity for oxygenates, with ethanol as the major product, demonstrates the feasibility of a two-step conversion of CO2 to liquid fuel that could be powered by renewable electricity.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "bf4a0b7d8c330ebc2679fcfcc0736e038b36b8e9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2289924248", "CorpusId": 56380584}, "title": "An Introduction to CO2 Capture and Storage", "abstract": "It has become increasingly clear that reduction of the emissions of carbon dioxide arising from combustion of fossil fuels is needed. Replacement of fossil fuels for other energy sources and measures to reduce the primary energy demand are important paths of achieving this goal. A third path, which is beginning to receive recognition, is the capture and storage of the carbon dioxide formed from the combustion or conversion of fossil fuels. The purpose of this symposium is to give an overview of the status of the technology for capture and storage, and to highlight related work carried out in the Nordic countries. Below an introduction to the CO2 problem and to the status of CO2 sequestration is given. The CO2 problem The latest IPCC evaluation concludes that the temperature increase during the last century was 0.6\u00b10.2oC (IPCC, 2001), and that it is \"likely that, in the Northern Hemisphere, the 1990s was the warmest decade and 1998 the warmest year\" during the last 1000 years. (However, \"\u2026less is known about annual averages prior to 1,000 years before present and for conditions prevailing in most of the Southern Hemisphere prior to 1861.\") The estimated temperatures during the last thousand years are shown in Fig. 1. Although it would be difficult to prove, it is very likely that the noted temperature increase has been caused by the emission of greenhouse gases, of which CO2 released from fossil fuel combustion is the primary one. Today the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is about 370 ppm, which is 30% higher than the pre-industrial level of 280 ppm. The stabilisation of the CO2 level at twice the pre-industrial level, or 550 ppm, is estimated to require a gradual reduction of the average CO2 emissions per capita by a factor of two before the year 2100, see Fig. 2. The corresponding reduction in Europe would have to be much greater because of the higher emissions per capita, about 10 ton/year. Even with such measures the climate is expected to be dramatically affected, with an estimated average temperature rise of 1.5-4.5 degrees. These numbers are put in perspective by a comparison: the average world temperature during the last ice age was approximately 4 degrees lower than today. Although many uncertainties remain regarding greenhouse gas effects, it is clear that even a temperature increase of a few degrees would have enormous", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "56c7ec2df6c5f1deb385c92ff60ac0e6cb12a271", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "5997736", "MAG": "2797035059", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-018-04423-1", "CorpusId": 48354961, "PubMed": "29895846"}, "title": "Estimating geological CO2 storage security to deliver on climate mitigation", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can help nations meet their Paris CO2 reduction commitments cost-effectively.

This combines quantitative estimates of geological subsurface CO2 retention, and of surface CO2 leakage.

At the top of the list of key issues are CCS costs: costs of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, compression, transport, storage, and so on. This research report touches upon several of these cost components. It also provides some technical models for determining the engineering and infrastructure requirements of CCS, and describes some correlations for estimating CO2 density and viscosity, both of which are often essential properties for modeling CCS. This report is actually a compilation of three separate research reports and is, therefore, divided into three separate sections.

Section I builds upon some of the knowledge from the latter sections, and Sections II & III can be considered as supplementary to Section I. * Section I: Techno-Economic Models for Carbon Dioxide Compression, Transport, and Storage \u2013 This section provides models for estimating the engineering requirements and costs of CCS infrastructure. Some of the models have been adapted from other studies, while others have been expressly developed in this study. * Section II: Simple Correlations for Estimating Carbon Dioxide Density and Viscosity as a Function of Temperature and Pressure \u2013 This section describes a set of simple correlations for estimating the density and viscosity of CO2 within the range of operating temperatures and pressures that might be encountered in CCS applications.

CO2 was captured by non-volatile amidine derivatives with simultaneous activation to form zwitterionic amidinium carbonate, and subsequent hydrogenation was facilitated by Rh/bisphosphine. The adsorption capacity and hydrogenation efficiency can be optimized by tuning the ethoxyl side chain.

Pre-emission capture and storage of CO2 in subsurface saline formations is one potential method to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the negative impact of global climate change. Like many large-scale resource assessments, the area under investigation is split into smaller, more manageable storage assessment units (SAUs), which must be aggregated with correctly propagated uncertainty to the basin, regional, and national scales. The aggregation methodology requires two types of data: marginal probability distributions of storage resource for each SAU, and a correlation matrix obtained by expert elicitation describing interdependencies between pairs of SAUs. Dependencies arise because geologic analogs, assessment methods, and assessors often overlap. The correlation matrix is used to induce rank correlation, using a Cholesky decomposition, among the empirical marginal distributions representing individually assessed SAUs. This manuscript presents a probabilistic aggregation method tailored to the correlations and dependencies inherent to a CO2 storage assessment. Aggregation results must be presented at the basin, regional, and national scales. A single stage approach, in which one large correlation matrix is defined and subsets are used for different scales, is compared to a multiple stage approach, in which new correlation matrices are created to aggregate intermediate results. Although the single-stage approach requires determination of significantly more correlation coefficients, it captures geologic dependencies among similar units in different basins and it is less sensitive to fluctuations in low correlation coefficients than the multiple stage approach. Thus, subsets of one single-stage correlation matrix are used to aggregate to basin, regional, and national scales.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "5d6da5f7b5b152b09791f5ef218a8c5df88a8b74", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2982447626", "DOI": "10.1007/s10098-019-01774-1", "CorpusId": 204971176}, "title": "Modeling and performance analysis of subcritical and supercritical coal-fired power plants with biomass co-firing and CO2 capture", "abstract": "Coal-fired power plants are the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into the atmosphere, and these emissions can be effectively reduced by improving the efficiency of the plants, co-firing sustainably grown biomass and applying carbon capture and storage technologies.

The impact of biomass (hybrid poplar) addition was investigated at different co-firing ratios varying up to 30% on a heat input basis. All plant configurations were modeled and simulated with Aspen Plus process simulation software. The results show that the use of a SC steam cycle has a positive impact on the energy and environmental performance of the investigated plants, improving the efficiency by 2.4% points and reducing the total fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by 6% in comparison to those of the SubC cases. Biomass co-firing has a negative impact on the energy performance of plants while significantly reducing fossil-based carbon emissions. The reduction of net CO2 emissions is almost proportional to the biomass percentage in the feed.

However there are substantial uncertainties about the costs of CCS. Costs for pre-combustion capture with compression (i.e. excluding costs of transport and storage and any revenue from EOR associated with storage) are examined in this discussion paper for First-of-a-Kind (FOAK) plant and for more mature technologies, or Nth-of-a-Kind plant (NOAK). For FOAK plant using solid fuels the levelised cost of electricity on a 2008 basis is approximately 10 cents/kWh higher with capture than for conventional plants (with a range of 8-12 cents/kWh). Costs of abatement are found typically to be approximately US$150/tCO2 avoided (with a range of US$120-180/tCO2 avoided). For NOAK plants the additional cost of electricity with capture is approximately 2-5 cents/kWh, with costs of the range of US$35-70/tCO2 avoided. Costs of abatement with carbon capture for other fuels and technologies are also estimated for NOAK plants. The costs of abatement are calculated with reference to conventional SCPC plant for both emissions and costs of electricity. Estimates for both FOAK and NOAK are mainly based on cost data from 2008, which was at the end of a period of more\u00a0\u00bb sustained escalation in the costs of power generation plant and other large capital projects. There are now indications of costs falling from these levels. This may reduce the costs of abatement and costs presented here may be 'peak of the market' estimates. If general cost levels return, for example, to those prevailing in 2005 to 2006 (by which time significant cost escalation had already occurred from previous levels), then costs of capture and compression for FOAK plants are expected to be US$110/tCO2 avoided (with a range of US$90-135/tCO2 avoided). For NOAK plants costs are expected to be US$25-50/tCO2. Based on these considerations a likely representative range of costs of abatement from CCS excluding transport and storage costs appears to be US$100-150/tCO2 for first-of-a-kind plants and perhaps US$30-50/tCO2 for nth-of-a-kind plants.The estimates for FOAK and NOAK costs appear to be broadly consistent in the light of estimates of the potential for cost reductions with increased experience. Cost reductions are expected from increasing scale, learning on individual components, and technological innovation including improved plant integration. Innovation and integration can both lower costs and increase net output with a given cost base. These factors are expected to reduce abatement costs by approximately 65% by 2030. The range of estimated costs for NOAK plants is within the range of plausible future carbon prices, implying that mature technology would be competitive with conventional fossil fuel plants at prevailing carbon prices. \u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "dc9b07d14623ac1e9b02f8d726a8bbd2c14aeb5f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2942438906", "DOI": "10.1007/s11027-019-09860-x", "CorpusId": 159220567}, "title": "Negative emissions of carbon dioxide through chemical-looping combustion (CLC) and gasification (CLG) using oxygen carriers based on manganese and iron", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an economically attractive strategy for avoiding carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from, e.g., power plants to the atmosphere. The combination of CCS and biomass combustion would result in a reduction of atmospheric CO2, or net negative emissions, as plant growth is a form of sequestration of atmospheric carbon. Carbon capture can be achieved in a variety of ways, one of which is chemical looping. Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) and chemical looping gasification (CLG) are two promising technologies for conversion of biomass to heat and power or syngas/methane with carbon capture. There have been significant advances made with respect to CLC in the last two decades for all types of fuel, with much less research on the gasification technology. CLG offers some interesting opportunities for production of biofuels together with carbon capture and may have several advantages with respect to the bench mark indirect gasification process or dual-bed fluidized bed (DFBG) in this respect. In CLG, an oxygen carrier is used as a bed material instead of sand, which is common in indirect gasification, and this could have several advantages: (i) all generated CO2 is present together with the syngas or methane in the fuel reactor outlet stream, thus in a concentrated stream, viable for separation and capture; (ii) the air reactor (or combustion chamber) should largely be free from trace impurities, thus preventing corrosion and fouling in this reactor; and (iii) the highly oxidizing conditions in the fuel reactor together with solid oxide surfaces should be advantageous with respect to limiting formation of tar species. In this study, two manganese ores and an iron-based waste material, LD slag, were investigated with respect to performance in these chemical-looping technologies. The materials were also impregnated with alkali (K) in order to gauge possible catalytic effects and also to establish a better understanding of the general behavior of oxygen carriers with alkali, an important component in biomass and biomass waste streams and often a precursor for high-temperature corrosion. The viability of the oxygen carriers was investigated using a synthetic biogas in a batch fluidized bed reactor. The conversion of CO, H2, CH4, and C2H4 was investigated in the temperature interval 800\u2013950\u00a0\u00b0C. The reactivity, or oxygen transfer rate, was highest for the manganese ores, followed by the LD slag. The conversion of C2H4 was generally high but could largely be attributed to thermal decomposition. The K-impregnated samples showed enhanced reactivity during combustion conditions, and the Mangagran-K sample was able to achieve full conversion of benzene. The interaction of the solid material with alkali showed widely different behavior. The two manganese ores retained almost all alkali after redox testing, albeit exhibiting different migration patterns inside the particles. LD slag lost most alkali to the gas phase during testing, although some remained, possibly explaining a small difference in reactivity. In summary, the CLC and CLG processes could clearly be interesting for production of heat, power, or biofuel with negative CO2 emissions. Manganese ores are most promising from this study, as they could absorb alkali, giving a better conversion and perhaps also inhibiting or limiting corrosion mechanisms in a combustor or gasifier.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "55043e8ef9ee8b09d423eee95e50920c3edfcac9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2165824256", "DOI": "10.1002/anie.201004537", "CorpusId": 5528490, "PubMed": "21132685"}, "title": "Metal-organic frameworks with incorporated carbon nanotubes: improving carbon dioxide and methane storage capacities by lithium doping.", "abstract": "Reduction of the anthropogenic emission of CO2 is currently a top priority because CO2 emission is closely associated with climate change. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the development of renewable and clean energy sources are two approaches for the reduction of CO2 emission. One of the most promising alternative fuels is CH4, which is the major component of natural gas. The efficient storage of CH4 is still one of the main challenges for its widespread application. Accordingly, the development of more efficient approaches for CO2 capture and CH4 storage is critically important. Recently, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs, e.g., MOF210 and NU-100) have shown great potential for gas storage because of their high specific surface area (SSA) and functionalized pore walls. However, most MOF materials still show relatively low CO2 and CH4 uptakes. To enhance CO2 and CH4 adsorption, it is imperative to develop new materials, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), or to modify MOFs by using postsynthetic approaches. Herein, we focus on the latter strategy. One of the modification approaches is incorporation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into MOFs in order to achieve enhanced composite performance, because of the unusual mechanical and hydrophobicity properties of CNTs. Another approach is doping MOFs or COFs with electropositive metals. Recent studies indicate that the surface carboxylate functional groups of a substrate could act as nucleation sites to form MOFs by heterogeneous nucleation and crystal growth. Both experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the H2 adsorption capacities of MOFs can be enhanced significantly by doping alkali-metal ions, in particular Li ions, to the frameworks, owing to the strong affinity of Li ions towards H2 molecules. [3d, 7] Similarly, Lan et al. also showed theoretically that doping of COFs with Li ions can significantly enhance the CH4 uptake of COFs. [8] Most recently, the multiscale simulations performed by Lan et al. indicate that Li is the best surface modifier of COFs for CO2 capture among a series of metals (Li, Na, K, Be, Mg Ca, Sc and Ti). Furthermore, their simulations show that the excess CO2 uptakes of the lithium-doped COFs can be enhanced by four to eight times compared to the undoped COFs at 298 K and 1 bar. Motivated by these experimental and theoretical results, we synthesized hybrid MOF materials by using the two modification techniques outlined above, that is, 1) incorporation of CNTs into [Cu3(C9H3O6)2(H2O)3]\u00b7x H2O ([Cu3(btc)2], HKUST-1; btc = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), which is an important MOF material owing to its open metal sides and high thermal stabilities, as well as its sorption properties, 10] and 2) doping [Cu3(btc)2] with Li + ions. We used lithium naphthalenide (LiC10H8 ) to introduce Li ions into the [Cu3(btc)2] frameworks. These frameworks have Cu 2+", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "a38f503835cbe956b332e648a802815aa5002009", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1977412609", "DOI": "10.1007/S11367-009-0102-8", "CorpusId": 108508029}, "title": "Environmental assessment of German electricity generation from coal-fired power plants with amine-based carbon capture", "abstract": "Background, aim, and scopeOne of the most important sources of global carbon dioxide emissions is the combustion of fossil fuels for power generation. Power plants contribute more than 40% of the worldwide anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Therefore, the increased requirements for climate protection are a great challenge for the power producers. In this context a significant increase in power plant efficiency will contribute to reduce specific CO2 emissions. Additionally, CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is receiving considerable attention as a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation option. CCS allows continued use of fossil fuels with no or little CO2 emissions given to the atmosphere. This could approve a moderate transition to a low-carbon energy generation over the next decades. Currently, R&D activities in the field of CCS are mainly concentrated on the development of capture techniques, the geological assessment of CO2 storage reservoirs, and on economic aspects. Although first studies on material and energy flows caused by CCS are available, a broader environmental analysis is necessary to show the overall environmental impacts of CCS. The objectives in this paper are coal-based power plants with and without CO2 capture via mono-ethanolamine (MEA) and the comparison of their environmental effects based on life cycle assessment methodology (LCA).MethodsThis LCA study examines the environmental and human health effects of power generation of five coal-based steam power plants, which differ in the year of installation (2005, 2010, 2020), the conversion efficiency, and in the ability and efficiency to capture CO2. For the removal of CO2 from combustion and gasification processes in power plants, three main technology concepts exist: (1) pre-combustion technology, (2) oxyfuel combustion systems, and (3) post-combustion separation. As post-combustion technology shows the highest level of maturity, this study concentrates on this route, focusing on capture using mono-ethanolamine (MEA). The analysis regards the post-combustion retrofit of coal power plants with MEA to be a general option in 2020.ResultsMaterial and energy flows are balanced on the level of single processes as well as for the whole process chains. The life cycle inventory clearly shows decreasing inputs and outputs according to the efficiency increase from 43% to 49% in case of the power plants without CO2 capture. In case of the MEA plants, all inputs and emissions raise, according to the additional energy consumption, except CO2 and sulphur dioxide. The strong decrease of SO2 partly results from the necessary improvement of desulphurisation if MEA wash is used. The influence of up and downstream activities on the results is determined. For the MEA plants, a considerable effect of up and downstream activities on the overall results is observed. Finally, the inventory results are assigned to selected impact categories. Global warming (GWP), human toxicity (HTP), acidification (AP), photo-oxidant formation (POCP), eutrophication (EP), and primary energy demand are adopted as impact categories. The impact assessment indicates decreasing impacts for all categories with increasing combustion efficiency for the coal plants without carbon capture. As expected, the GWP for the MEA plants is much lower than for the power plants without CO2 capture. In contrast to this, the HTP and the EP are much higher (up to three times) for the MEA plants. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the origin of coal and the corresponding transport distances have a significant impact on the overall results. Furthermore, it is concluded from the sensitivity analysis that for CCS systems the length of CO2 pipeline has a negligible effect in comparison with the effect of capture efficiency. The LCA is completed by a normalisation of the environmental impact categories.DiscussionThe development of combustion efficiency in case of the power plants without CO2 capture has the main influence on the decreasing mass flows at the input side. The energy penalty of the MEA plants affects the use of the inputs into the opposite direction. Although the power producer\u2019s focus is on the power plant, the sense of a life cycle assessment is an integrated environmental assessment of the full life cycle of a product (here 1 kWh) including up and downstream processes. Therefore, the inventory results are presented without and with up and downstream processes. The inventory analysis clearly shows the significant influence of the up and downstream processes on the overall emissions. This influence is higher for the MEA plants than for the power plants without capture. In case of CO2 emissions, the significance of up and downstream processes is especially considerable (approx. 30%). Sensitivity analysis reveals that the origin of coal and the corresponding transport distances have a significant impact on the overall results.ConclusionsThe results point out that the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere is achieved at the expense of increasing other emissions and corresponding environmental impacts. In most cases the influence of up and downstream processes is significant. Therefore, life cycle approaches are necessary to get a holistic evaluation. It also shows that the implementation of new techniques can change the environmental assessment of the process chain and, thus, positive and negative effects have to be compared and weighed up against each other.PerspectivesAs there exist several possible technical options for CO2 capture, further studies are necessary to compare the overall environmental effects of competing capture concepts such as pre-combustion and oxyfuel technology. Additionally, gas separating membranes should be part of further studies as they have the potential to contribute to all three main capture technology routes. Further studies with more detail and reliable inventories for CO2 compression and liquefaction as well as for gas conditioning as an interface between CO2 capture and transport are needed. Furthermore, the environmental effects including long-term CO2 emission from the storage sites are recommended.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "924bc0863598b75e5176cbd8829e5ff3d4dd3df4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2325265950", "DOI": "10.1038/NENERGY.2016.34", "CorpusId": 42123784}, "title": "The role of metal\u2013organic frameworks in a carbon-neutral energy cycle", "abstract": "Reducing society's reliance on fossil fuels presents one of the most pressing energy and environmental challenges facing our planet.

Adsorption is considered as one of the efficient options for CO\u2082 capture because of its cost advantage, low energy requirement and extensive applicability over a relatively wide range of temperature and pressure. The metal organic frameworks (MOFs) show widely potential application prospects in CO\u2082 capture and storage owing to their outstanding textural properties, such as the extraordinarily high specific surface area, tunable pore size, ultrahigh porosity (up to 90%), high crystallinity, adjustable internal surface properties, and controllable structure.

The extraordinary characteristics and CO\u2082 capture performance of Zeolitic Imidazolate Frameworks (ZIFs), Bio-metal organic frameworks (bio-MOFs), IL@MOFs and MOF-composite materials were highlighted. The promising strategies for improving the CO\u2082 adsorption properties of MOFs materials, especially the low-pressure adsorption performance under actual flue gas conditions, are also carefully summarized.

Carbon capture and storage technologies have been identified as a key measure in reducing the carbon-intensity of the power sector. However, no cost-effective technology has yet been developed on a commercial scale, which is mostly due to high capital cost. Moreover, the mature technologies, such as amine scrubbing or oxy-combustion technologies, impose a high projected efficiency penalty (8\u201312.5% points) upon integration to the power plant. The calcium looping process, which is currently being tested experimentally in bench- and pilot-scale plants worldwide, is regarded as a promising alternative to the chemical solvent scrubbing approach, as it leads to the projected efficiency penalty of 6\u20138% points. The calcium looping concept has been developing rapidly due to the introduction of new test facilities, new correlations for process modelling, and process configurations for improved performance. The first part of this review provides an overview of the bench- and pilot-plant test facilities available worldwide. The focus is put on summarising the characteristics and operating conditions of the test facilities, as well as extracting the key experimental findings. Additionally, the experimental data suitable for validation or verification of the process models are presented. In the second part, the approaches to the carbonator and the calciner reactor modelling are summarised and classified in five model complexity levels. Moreover, the model limitations are assessed and the needs for modelling baselines for further process analyses are identified. Finally, in the third part the approaches for the integration of calcium looping to the power generation systems and for the improvement of the process performance are identified and evaluated. This review indicates that calcium looping integration resulted in the projected efficiency penalty of 2.6\u20137.9% points for the coal-fired power plants and 9.1\u201311.4% points for the combined-cycle power plants.
