Ship based carbon capture (SBCC) could play a large role in reducing these emissions on the short term. This study gives an update on the work that has been conducted towards carbon capture and storage on LNG fuelled vessels. This is done by discussing the results of the DerisCO2 project where CO2 capture on the LNG fuelled Sleipnir vessel from Heerema Marine Contractors is analysed. One of the main advantages of SBCC is the heat integration of the vessel and the capture plant, which drastically decreases the heat and electricity demand of the capture plant and the total capture costs become fully CAPEX dominated. Taking into account the operational profile of the Sleipnir vessel, a conceptual design is proposed which consists of four absorbers and a single desorber, which is able to capture 72.5% of the CO2 emissions over the whole sailing profile. The total cost of CO2 capture, liquefaction and on-board storage for the Sleipnir vessel is estimated at 115 \u20ac/ton CO2, where the variable OPEX is estimated at 5.7% of the total costs. Lastly, the results of the tilting table experiments in the DerisCO2 project are discussed, where the effect of vessel tilting at sea on CO2 absorption is analysed. It is shown that static tilting causes a reduction in the overall mass transfer rate of CO2 absorption, but upon continuous tilting, the mass transfer rate is similar compared to static tests, which sets the expectation that vessel tilting at sea will have no negative effect on CO2 absorption.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "6c48b65eb58ab2f67441fe9c23f5916d84c0b55c", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1016/j.erss.2021.102452", "CorpusId": 245449672}, "title": "What are the potential paths for carbon capture and storage in Sweden?

Clear targets are set at European level for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and primary energy consumption and for the integration of renewable energy. Carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion in the industry and energy sectors account for a major share of greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, a low carbon shift in industrial and business park energy systems is called for. Low carbon business parks minimise energy-related carbon dioxide emissions by enhanced energy efficiency, heat recovery in and between companies, maximal exploitation of local renewable energy production, and energy storage, combined in a collective energy system. Moreover, companies with complementary energy profiles are clustered to exploit energy synergies. \nThe design of low carbon energy systems is facilitated using the holistic approach of techno-economic energy models. These models take into account the complex interactions between the components of an energy system and assist in determining an optimal trade-off between energetic, economic and environmental performances. In this work, existing energy model classifications are scanned for adequate model characteristics and accordingly, a confined number of energy models are selected and described. Subsequently, a practical categorisation is proposed, existing of energy system evolution, optimisation, simulation, accounting and integration models, while key model features are compared. Next, essential features for modelling energy systems at business park scale are identified: \nAs a first key feature, a superstructure-based optimisation approach avoids the need for a priori decisions on the system\u2019s configuration, since a mathematical algorithm automatically identifies the optimal configuration in a superstructure that embeds all feasible configurations. Secondly, the representation of time needs to incorporate sufficient temporal detail to capture important characteristics and peaks in time-varying energy demands, energy prices and operation conditions of energy conversion technologies. Thirdly, energy technologies need to be accurately represented at equipment unit level by incorporating part-load operation and investment cost subject to economy of scale in the model formulation. In addition, the benefits of installing multiple units per technology must be considered. A generic model formulation of technology models facilitates the introduction of new technology types. As a fourth important feature, the potential of thermodynamically feasible heat exchange between thermal processes needs to be exploited, while optimally integrating energy technologies to fulfil remaining thermal demands. For this purpose, thermal streams need to be represented by heat \u2013temperature profiles. Moreover, restrictions to direct heat exchange between process streams need to be taken into account. Finally, the possibility for energy storage needs to be included to enhance the integration of non-dispatchable renewable energy technologies and to bridge any asynchrony between cooling and heating demands. \nStarting from these essential features, a techno-economic optimisation model (Syn-E-Sys), is developed customised for the design of low carbon energy systems on business park scale. The model comprises two sequential stages. In the first stage, heat recovery within the system is maximised, while energy supply and energy storage technologies are optimally integrated and designed to fulfil remaining energy requirements at minimum total annualised costs. Predefined variations in thermal and electrical energy demand and supply are taken into account, next to a carbon emission cap. At the same time, heat networks can be deployed to transfer heat between separate parts of the system. In the second stage, the model generates an optimal multi-period heat exchanger network enabling all required heat exchanges. \nSyn-E-Sys builds upon a multi-period energy integration model that can deal with restrictions in heat exchange. It is combined with a generic technology model, that features part-load operation as well as investment cost subject to economy of scale, and a generic energy storage model. The technology model can be manipulated to represent various thermal or electrical energy conversion technology units, and serves as a building block to model more complex technologies. The storage model covers electrical as well as thermal energy storage, taking into account the effect of hourly energy losses on the storage level, without increasing the number of time steps to be analysed. For this purpose, time sequence is introduced by dividing the year into a set of time slices and assigning them to a hierarchical time structure. In addition, a more complex model for storage of sensible heat is integrated, consisting of a stack of interconnected virtual tanks. To enable the optimisation of the number of units per technology in the energy system configuration, an automated superstructure expansion procedure is incorporated. Heat transfer unit envelope curves are calculated to facilitate the choice of appropriate temperature levels for heat networks. Heat networks that are embedded within this envelope, completely avoid the increase in energy requirements that would result from the heat exchange restrictions between separated parts of the energy system. Finally, the heat exchanger network is automatically generated using a multi-period stage-wise superstructure. \nTwo problems inherent to the heat cascade formulation are encountered during model development. As a first issue, heat networks can form self-sustaining energy loops if their hot and cold streams are not completely embedded within the envelope. This phenomenon is referred to in this work as phantom heat. As a second issue, the heat cascade formulation does not prevent that a thermal storage releases its heat to a cooling technology. \nTo demonstrate the specific features of Syn-E-Sys and its holistic approach towards the synthesis of low carbon energy systems, the model is applied to a generic case study and to a case study from literature. The generic case study is set up to demonstrate the design of an energy system including non-dispatchable renewable energy and energy storage, subject to a carbon emission cap. For this purpose, the year is subdivided into a set of empirically defined time slices that are connected to a hierarchical time structure composed of seasons, daytypes and intra-daily time segments. The results obtained by Syn-E-Sys show a complex interaction between energy supply, energy storage and energy import/export to fulfil energy demands, while keeping carbon emissions below the predefined cap. The model enables optimisation of the intra-annual charge pattern and the capacity of thermal and electrical storage. Moreover, an optimal heat exchanger network is automatically generated. In the second case study, heat recovery is optimised for a drying process in the paper industry. To avoid the energy penalty due to heat exchange restrictions between two separated process parts, heat transfer units need to be optimally integrated. Firstly, a simplified version of the original problem is set up in Syn-E-Sys and the obtained results correspond well to literature. Subsequently, the original problem is extended to demonstrate the optimal integration of heat transfer units in a multi-period situation. In conclusion, Syn-E-Sys facilitates optimal design of low carbon energy systems on business park scale, taking into account the complex time-varying interactions between thermal and electrical energy demand, supply and storage, while the potential for heat recovery is fully exploited.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "68918a0efb456ba9986f611835a479104fd14a6b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3153449770", "DOI": "10.36689/UHK/HED/2021-01-016", "CorpusId": 234891067}, "title": "Is There a Future for Carbon Capture and Storage?", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "af8a10d62825fda230674323cc1d4aae38ca7db3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2487398425", "DOI": "10.1017/CBO9781316136058.012", "CorpusId": 133141777}, "title": "The real drivers of carbon capture and storage in China", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "86f809b5694b76521b3e486147081679a8bbc42b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2582903037", "CorpusId": 132472902}, "title": "Energy and Greenhouse", "abstract": "The projections of the International Energy Agency and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change indicate that the use of fossil fuels is increasing and in turn it is doubling the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere.

CCS is included to achieve this target. This paper first explains the CO2 storage potential both in onshore and offshore areas in Korea. While onshore sedimentary basins seem to have unfavorable physical properties such as porosity and permeability, offshore sedimentary basins exhibit very good physical properties in sand thickness and porosity. In order to implement CCS project at the scale needed to achieve a meaningful reduction of carbon dioxide emissions, the knowledge of the available CO2 storage capacity obtained by detailed matching of large stationary CO2 sources with geological storage sites is required.

Desolvation of this material generates coordinatively unsaturated low-spin cobalt(II) centers that exhibit a strong preference for binding O2 over N2, with isosteric heats of adsorption (Qst) of \u221234(1) and \u221212(1) kJ/ mol, respectively. The low-spin (S = 1/2) electronic configuration of the metal centers in the desolvated framework is supported by structural, magnetic susceptibility, and computational studies.

Electronic structure calculations suggest that the O2 adducts in Co-BTTri are best described as cobalt(II)\u2212dioxygen species with partial electron transfer, while the stronger binding sites in Co-BDTriP form cobalt(III)\u2212superoxo moieties. The stability, selectivity, and high O2 adsorption capacity of these materials render them promising new adsorbents for air separation processes. \u25a0 INTRODUCTION Decades after their discovery in the mid-19th century, synthetic transition metal\u2212dioxygen compounds continue to command widespread interest due to their relevance as models of biological oxygen carriers and metalloenzymes, catalysts in oxidation chemistry, and adsorbents for industrial air separation applications. Recently, rising atmospheric CO2 levels have generated increasing impetus for research efforts in this last area, as several proposed carbon capture and sequestration technologies require the use of high-purity oxygen. Briefly, precombustion CO2 capture utilizes O2 for the gasification of coal, while oxyfuel combustion systems burn fuel in the presence of pure O2 diluted in CO2. As high-purity oxygen is currently produced on a large scale via energetically demanding cryogenic distillation, there is a need for alternative, lower-cost air separation technologies. Metal\u2212organic frameworks, a relatively new class of highly crystalline and porous materials, have the potential to transform a variety of gas separation and storage processes, including oxygen purification from air. For example, frameworks containing coordinatively unsaturated redox-active metal centers that can reversibly bind and reduce oxygen, such as Cr3(btc)2, Cr-BTT, and Fe2(dobdc), exhibit much higher selectivities and total capacities than the ion-exchanged zeolites currently used in adsorbent-based air separation plants and devices. Furthermore, most ion-exchanged zeolites are N2-selective, as their extra-framework cations (e.g., Li ) are generally redox-inactive and interact preferentially with the larger quadrupole moment of nitrogen. Because oxygen constitutes a smaller fraction of air than nitrogen (21% versus 78%), O2-selective materials such as the aforementioned metal\u2212organic frameworks are inherently more efficient than N2-selective adsorbents. In spite of these advantages, however, many improvements are still necessary with respect to the thermal stability and cyclability of metal\u2212organic frameworks. Indeed, Fe2(dobdc) irreversibly oxidizes at temperatures above 222 K, while chromium frameworks can exhibit gradual capacity losses over multiple cycles. Significantly, all of these framework materials decompose over time when exposed to humid air.

The trajectories of soil carbon (C) in the changing climate are of utmost importance, as soil carbon is a substantial carbon storage with a large potential to impact the atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) burden. Atmospheric CO2 observations integrate all processes affecting C exchange between the surface and the atmosphere. Therefore they provide a benchmark for carbon cycle models. We evaluated two distinct soil carbon models (CBALANCE and YASSO) that were implemented to a global land surface model (JSBACH) against atmospheric CO2 observations. We transported the biospheric carbon fluxes obtained by JSBACH using the atmospheric transport model TM5 to obtain atmospheric CO2. We then compared these results with surface observations from Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) stations as well as with column XCO2 retrievals from the GOSAT satellite. The seasonal cycles of atmospheric CO2 estimated by the two different soil models differed. The estimates from the CBALANCE soil model were more in line with the surface observations at low latitudes (0\u2009N\u201345\u2009N) with only 1\u2009% bias in the seasonal cycle amplitude (SCA), whereas YASSO was underestimating the SCA in this region by 32\u2009%. YASSO gave more realistic seasonal cycle amplitudes of CO2 at northern boreal sites (north of 45\u2009N) with underestimation of 15\u2009% compared to 30\u2009% overestimation by CBALANCE. Generally, the estimates from CBALANCE were more successful in capturing the seasonal patterns and seasonal cycle amplitudes of atmospheric CO2 even though it overestimated soil carbon stocks by 225\u2009% (compared to underestimation of 36\u2009% by YASSO) and its predictions of the global distribution of soil carbon stocks was unrealistic. The reasons for these differences in the results are related to the different environmental drivers and their functional dependencies of these two soil carbon models. In the tropical region the YASSO model showed earlier increase in season of the heterotophic respiration since it is driven by precipitation instead of soil moisture as CBALANCE. In the temperate and boreal region the role of temperature is more dominant. There the heterotophic respiration from the YASSO model had larger annual variability, driven by air temperature, compared to the CBALANCE which is driven by soil temperature. The results underline the importance of using sub-yearly data in the development of soil carbon models when they are used in shorter than annual time scales.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "64a3ddf052a3d59fe5d5fd03560d55e5b4bbc01b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3153501798", "DOI": "10.48175/IJARSCT-1009", "CorpusId": 234872430}, "title": "Air Quality Monitoring Using Internet of Things", "abstract": "A remote online carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration monitoring system is developed, based on the technologies of wireless sensor networks, in allusion to the gas leakage monitoring requirement for CO2 capture and storage.

Improved agricultural management plays a vital role in protecting soils from degradation in Eastern Africa. Changing practices such as reducing tillage, fertilizer use or cover crops are expected to enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) storage, with climate change mitigation co-benefits, while increasing crop production. However, the quantification of cropland managements\u2019 effects on agricultural ecosystems remains inadequate in this region. Here, we explored seven management practices and their potential effects on soil carbon (C) pools, nitrogen (N) losses, and crop yields under different climate scenarios, using the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS. The model performance is evaluated against observations from two long-term maize field trials in western Kenya and reported estimates from published sources. LPJ-GUESS generally produces soil C stocks and maize productivity comparable with measurements, and mostly captures the SOC decline under some management practices that is observed in the field experiments. We found that for large parts of Kenya and Ethiopia, an integrated conservation agriculture practice (no-tillage, residue and manure application, and cover crops) increases SOC levels in the long term (+11 % on average), accompanied by increased crop yields (+22 %) in comparison to the standard management. Planting nitrogen-fixing cover crops in our simulations is also identified as a promising individual practice in Eastern Africa to increase soil C storage (+4 %) and crop production (+18 %), with low environmental cost of N losses (+24 %). These management impacts are also sustained in simulations of three future climate pathways. This study highlights the possibilities of conservation agriculture when targeting long-term environmental sustainability and food security in crop ecosystems, particularly for those with poor soil conditions in tropical climates.\n", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "18b270f9c2085989a2a4c3cd8255944b782d330a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2735204142", "CorpusId": 64772809}, "title": "Construction of an integrated geological model characterized by a seismic survey data and calibrated by log-based monitoring data: A case study at Nagaoka CO2 injection site", "abstract": "Widespread adoption of CCS technology could be key to limiting global average temperature increase.

Carbon capture and storage could potentially decrease the required renewable energy capacity, while simultaneously increasing grid flexibility. This research focuses on finding a cost-optimal composition of technologies, while abiding by the goals set in the Paris climate treaty. To investigate this objective, two optimisation models are compared: a linear programmed optimisation model with a high temporal and low technical resolution, and a unit commitment model with a low temporal but high technical resolution. Fixed costs and installed capacities are determined by the linear model. Subsequently, both models calculate the optimal generation mix. Three scenarios for 2050 were evaluated: a 'business as usual' reference scenario with maximum emission comparable to 2014 levels, a scenario with a maximum emission consistent with a 96% reduction in 2050 compared to 2014 and a scenario with that same target and the possibility to implement carbon capture and storage. The results show that the goals set by the Paris agreement increase system costs of the European power sector, but the increase is moderated by deployment of carbon capture and storage. Compared to the linear model, unit commitment increases variable costs, but this increase is modest, serving as confirmation that a linear modelling approach can be sufficient for answering a wide range of questions.

The Biot's equations of motion were formulated using a finite difference algorithm with fourth order accuracy in space and second order accuracy in time. We examined two examples, where the first was a single layer sandstone saturated with brine and CO2 and second, a two-layered sandstone model with same matrix properties in both layers, but with different fluid content. As predicted by Biot's theory a slow compressional wave was observed in the particle velocity snapshots. In the layered model, at the boundary, the slow P-wave converts to a P-wave that travels faster than the slow P-wave. The results showed that our algorithm handles the layered model perfectly and should be examined for more complicated models. In the future, this finite difference algorithm could be used for inversion to obtain the properties of the porous media, such as saturation. INTRODUCTION Seismic modeling is an important part of the seismic inversion algorithm. In elastic seismic modeling the pore fluid properties such as density, velocity, viscosity and satura- tion are neglected in spite of the reservoir rocks being porous media saturated with fluids. Wave propagation in porous media has attracted attention in the last fifty years since Mau- rice Biot established his theory on poroelasticity (Biot, 1962). Biot's theory could be used in the oil and gas industry for exploration and monitoring purposes. It could also be used for detection of CO2 at Carbon Capture and Storage projects where CO2 is injected into deep geological formations for permanent storage. Wave propagation in a poroelastic media is more complicated than the elastic media due to the existence of pore fluid. The relative movement of the fluid with respect to the solid generates a second P-wave called \"slow P-wave\" which is strongly dissipative and has a velocity close to the velocity of the fluid. Numerical examination of the Biot's theory has been done in several ways (Carcione et al., 2010). Finite difference method is one of the most commonly used methods for numeri- cal modeling. The Biot's equations have been formulated using various finite difference schemes. Zhu and McMechan (1991) used central-difference approximation to formulate the particle displacements.

This has been especially important as the project changed, operating in a niche space between Victorian environment, petroleum and water Acts. This process has allowed CO2CRC to contribute to alignment efforts within regulatory bodies, to enhance regulations to cover project activities, ensuring best practices are documented and observed to the satisfaction of the regulators and wider community. The Otway Basin in south-west Victoria is a region not immune to broader community concerns regarding the oil and gas and other industries.

As such, this thesis explores the use of a similar but betterknown technology\u2014hydraulic fracturing\u2014as an analogue for learning lessons about public acceptance of the geologic storage component of CCS. The thesis asks two questions: (1) What factors are associated with public acceptance of geologic storage? And (2) What actions should communities, regulators, and stakeholders take to ensure the safe and efficient deployment of CCS technology? The thesis investigates these questions using three separate but related analyses. A series of regressions explores links between states' history of fossil fuel extraction and current regulatory attitudes toward hydraulic fracturing. A comparative case study characterizes trends in the development of laws and regulations related to hydraulic fracturing in three states: Pennsylvania, New York State, and Colorado. Finally, a survey identifies factors associated with positive and negative public perceptions of both hydraulic fracturing and CCS. The survey includes an experimental question that measures the extent to which compensation can be used to improve public acceptance for facility siting. Through these analyses, the thesis reaches several conclusions. States with an extensive history of fossil fuel extraction are more likely to regulate hydraulic fracturing with a moderate level of regulatory stringency, and similar tendencies toward CCS are likely. Municipalities are playing an increasingly significant role in the regulation of hydraulic fracturing, and are likely to be important stakeholders for CCS projects as well. A number of demographic and worldview factors are associated with public acceptance, but none were found to have substantial predictive power. However, the amount of compensation offered to nearby residents was found to have a moderate effect on public acceptance. Developers should therefore consider compensation a tool for increasing the likelihood of acceptance among residents nearby a potential project site. Policymakers should in turn institute market incentives such as robust carbon prices to foster a financial environment that encourages developers to engage with municipalities and residents.

Major Professors: Fu Zhao and Larry Nies. Most power generation in the United States is derived from the combustion of fossil fuels, primarily coal and natural gas. As a result, greenhouse gases (GHGs) are generated, and they act to trap radiant heat from the Earth. When GHGs are discussed, attention is usually concentrated on carbon dioxide (CO2) because it is believed to be the most manageable anthropogenic GHG. Therefore, introducing new technologies, primarily those which deal with CO2 capture and storage, is seen as a potential option for managing GHGs. Oil and gas reservoirs, saline formations, and un-mineable coal beds are examples of underground CO2 storage sites. In the United States, it has been estimated that these sites together have the potential capacity to store the country\u2019s CO2 emissions for the next 500 years. For this reason, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has become a very attractive approach by several industries, including the coal-fired power industry, to reduce their GHG emissions. However, the implementation of CCS on a broad scale will require an enormous input of resources and energy, which will be used during the CCS production, installation, and operation phases.

In this paper, two configurations were simulated and economically examined to mitigate the re-boiler duty and power loss from the 495\u00a0MW West\u00a0Damietta power plant, Egypt. The first approach is to increase carbon concentrations in the feed to carbon capture plant by recycling part of exhaust gas back to the combustion chamber with different ratios (0%\u201335%), the second approach is implementing parabolic-trough solar collectors to handle the reboiler load instead of low-pressure steam extracted from the power plant.

The results revealed that increasing carbon content led to a remarkable decrease in reboiler duty by up to around 20%.

At the ecosystem level, plant secondary compounds (PSCs) drive key processes, such as litter degradation, and thus nutrient cycling (Chomel et al., 2016; Adamczyk et al., 2018). At the plant level, PSCs are employed to counter herbivore attacks, cope with changes in the environment, and ultimately ensure plant survival. PSCs are chemically diverse and their abundance shifts depending on biotic and abiotic stressors, but also across species and even organs within a species. The research highlighted in this collection combines shortand long-term studies in the greenhouse and in the field with a focus on phenolics and terpenes, both at the tree and ecosystem level. Climate change factors, such as elevated atmospheric CO2 levels and/or enhanced temperature might lead to counteracting responses of trees and forest ecosystems. Holopainen et al. reviewed how forest ecosystems change depending on the influence of abiotic and biotic factors on PSC synthesis. Different aspects of climate change show counteracting effects on PSCs: for example, in response to rising CO2 total phenolics increased and terpenes decreased in the leaves, whereas warming showed the opposite effect (Holopainen et al.). According to M\u00e4ki et al. the temporal dynamics of PSCs such as monoterpenes in forest ecosystems also depend on temperature and rainfall and are linked to the degradation of litter. Berini et al. used an untargeted metabolomics approach for five tree species and concluded that effects of the environment are species-specific and differ depending on the abiotic factors in question. However, indirect consequences of measures to mitigate global change are likely to cause further problems. For example, fertilization with nitrogen to increase carbon sequestration might result in increased insect herbivory in the future. The phenolic levels of mature Picea abies trees were reduced after 13 years of nitrogen deposition which\u2014in combination with higher nitrogen content in the needles\u2014might severely decrease tree resistance to herbivory (Nybakken et al.). In contrast, in Picea abies, levels of the PSCs dihydroflavonol and flavan-3-ol increased after inoculation with a fungus related to bark beetle attack and negatively affected both bark beetle and fungus (Hammerbacher et al.).

The energy sector contributes to a large portion of the carbon emissions and a wide range of technologies need to be implemented to make the progression towards the low carbon dioxide emission. CO\u2082 capture and storage (CCS) is seen as a technology that can reduce the carbon emissions in the coal fired power stations. This will help reduce the rate of climate change by removing greenhouse gases that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere. Carbon capture and storage involves the capture of carbon dioxide gas from within the CO\u2082 generation process, compressing it into a supercritical fluid and finally sequestrating it. Implementing CCS technology for electricity production has an impact on the net power output of the power plant and it also has a high capital and operating cost. Among the different capture technologies, solvent absorption is considered to be the benchmark amongst the post-combustion carbon capture technologies. However, there are other technologies that have potential to be energy and cost competitive such as: adsorption, membranes and low-temperature separation. The aim of the PhD is to improve the integration of the capture processes with the power plant stations to reduce the energy penalty associated with the addition of CCS by combining current carbon capture technologies to form hybrid post-combustion carbon capture processes and evaluate their performances. A hybrid post-combustion carbon capture process consists of two steps: an initial recovery step would increase the concentration of CO\u2082 in the flue gas whilst trying to limit the amount of CO\u2082 lost in the waste gas. The second step would then be a purification step, where the CO\u2082 gas is purified and pressurised to the sequestration requirement. The research will develop a methodology to assess carbon capture technologies using exergy analysis, in combination with pinch analysis and optimisation methods, such as multi-objective optimisation (MOO). The hybrid carbon capture technologies is modelled using Aspen HYSYS\u00ae. These models provide the information to perform the analysis and optimisation of the power plants to determine the energy and cost targets. The two hybrid processes that were developed are VSA/low-temperature separation hybrid carbon capture processes and membrane/low-temperature separation hybrid carbon capture processes. The processes were then evaluated using MOO and the energetic and economic performance were compared to the MEA solvent absorption carbon capture processes. Hybrid carbon capture processes using technologies such as VSA, membranes and low-temperature carbon separation have shown potential to be energetically and economically competitive with the established MEA solvent absorption. The VSA/low-temperature hybrid process requires a specific shaft work of 1.46 GJe/t (CO\u2082 captured) when 90.0 % of the CO\u2082 is being recovered. The membrane/low-temperature hybrid carbon capture process required a specific shaft work of 1.38 GJe/t (CO\u2082 captured) at 90% CO\u2082 recovery rate when mixed refrigerant is used to achieve the low temperatures. On an economic perspective, the VSA/low-temperature separation hybrid process had a higher cost of avoidance of $78/t (CO\u2082 avoided) compared to the $67//t (CO\u2082 avoided) of the membrane/low-temperature separation hybrid process. Finally, beyond analysing the overall performance of the hybrid processes, the thesis allowed each hybrid process to be analysed in depth through heat integration and MOO; the energy trade-off between the CO\u2082 recovery stage and CO\u2082 purification stage was studied. The difference in using mixed ethane/propane refrigerant versus propane only refrigeration was also investigated.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "d39745011465daeafe69c5c8db4fc8d733256756", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3195064635", "DOI": "10.1002/er.7199", "CorpusId": 238675301}, "title": "Oxy\u2010fuel combustion for carbon capture and storage in internal combustion engines \u2013 A review", "abstract": "As the impacts of global warming have become increasingly severe, oxy\u2010fuel combustion has been widely considered a promising solution for carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) to achieve net\u2010zero emissions.

Global warming is amongst the effects of this greenhouse gas. Cimpor, a Portuguese Cement plant, is well aware of this issue, as the cement industry is currently one of the world\u2019s main industrial sources of CO2 emissions. Many industries are implementing large-scale CO2 capture, usage and storage (CCUS). Although there are a lot of possibilities where CCUS can be employed, estimated costs for its application appear to be extremely high; from today\u2019s view, cement production costs would roughly double. The use of captured CO2 can become a profitable business, in addition to controlling CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Among all the possible CO2-usage technologies, a CO2 conversion to methanol process was simulated and improved with Aspen Plus\u00ae. The simulation for producing fuel grade methanol is divided in sections, namely a gas compression section, a reaction section where hydrogenation takes place, followed by a separation downstream section. Several improvements were done based on utility optimization and heat integration between all process sections. Activated analysis tools were used to compute the process parameters. Heat exchangers were sized and summarized in TEMA sheets. To argue the feasibility of CO2 conversion processes, nine different improvement scenarios on the design of carbon dioxide conversion to methanol process were made. These improvements resulted in a decrease of some Key Performance Indicators (KPI) between 50-70%, leading to a 69% KPI enhancement of hydrogen efficiency and generating methanol at 1.6 thousand euro per tonne.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "976845f5033328974381ad7141a156f7f64e21aa", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3142896211", "DOI": "10.2139/SSRN.3816112", "CorpusId": 233927815}, "title": "Assessment of an Integrated Direct CO2 Air Capture System Using Wind Power with Compressed Air Energy Storage in Northern Regions", "abstract": "This work examines the techno-economic viability for replacing, in remote Northern Canadian villages not connected to the grid, local diesel generation systems with a wind turbine potentially combined with compressed air energy storage and/or CO2 direct-air capture systems.

Capture of CO2 can be applied to large point sources. The CO2 would then be compressed and transported for storage in geological formations, in the ocean, in mineral carbonates2, or for use in industrial processes. The net reduction of emissions to the atmosphere through CCS depends on the fraction of CO2 captured, the increased CO2 production resulting from loss in overall efficiency of power plants or industrial processes due to the additional energy required for capture, transport and storage, any leakage from transport and the fraction of CO2 retained in storage over the long term. There are different types of CO2 capture systems: post combustion pre-combustion and oxyfuel combustion. The concentration of CO2 in the gas stream, the pressure of the gas stream and the fuel type (solid or gas) are important factors in selecting the capture system. Storage of CO2 in deep, onshore or offshore geological formations uses many of the same technologies that have been developed by the oil and gas industry and has been proven to be economically feasible under specific conditions for oil and gas fields and saline formations. The reaction of CO2 with metal oxides, which are abundant in silicate minerals and available in small quantities in waste streams, produces stable carbonates. With appropriate site selection based on available subsurface information, a monitoring program to detect problems, a regulatory system and the appropriate use of remediation methods to stop or control CO2 releases if they arise, the local health, safety and environment risks of geological storage would be comparable to the risks of current activities such as natural gas storage and deep underground disposal of acid gas.

CCS is considered as one of the most promising options to mitigate atmospheric emissions of CO2 from large-scale use of fossil fuels and subsequent climate change. Geologic sequestration of CO2 involves the injection of the carbon dioxide into deep oceans, into the subsurface, typically into deep saline aquifers, in depleted oil and gas reservoirs, in enhanced oil and gas recovery (EOR and EGR, respectively) and in unminable coal seams. Carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) is a rising technology entailing the productive use of the captured carbon dioxide related to the use of CO2 for beneficial purposes as EOR. Sequestration of CO2 in sub-seabed geological formations is currently among techniques intensely studied by the international research community for their potential to reduce greenhouse gases. The legal framework for CCS technologies is based on the amendments adopted by the London Protocol and the OSPAR Convention that allows and regulates the storage of CO2 from CCS systems in geological formations under the seabed. The EU Directive on the geological storage of CO2 establishes the legal framework to this activity in a safety way to the environment and would make feasible the sustainable develop and deployed of the CCS technologies. The marine environment acidification and the potential contamination by hazardous substances due to their mobilization from contaminated sediment in contact with acidified marine water, is a subject of concern in the framework of the UE marine environment protection established under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. During geologic sequestration, CO2 is stored via hydrodynamic, solubility or mineral trapping. Injection of CO2 by CCS technologies will occupy extensive areas.

Despite existing experience and number of existing operational projects worldwide, a common fear concerning safety of the onshore, large scale geological storage of CO 2 still occurs. Because of that fear, some European countries substantially limited even demonstration CCS projects. However, opinions on the method's safety should be based on solid geological evidence, not fears. Herein I provide some evidence from the Lower Jurassic basin in Poland that the method is safe. The key issue is the geological integrity of a seal. High-resolution sequence stratigraphy verified by chemostratigraphical correlation based on 13 C isotope correlation, proved that one of key seal formations, the lower Toarcian Ciechocinek formation composed of clayey-muddy rocks with sandstone intercalation, is integral in terms of its lithology and spatial extent over the larger part of the Polish basin and provides an excellent seal. Origin of such favourable properties is attributed to climatic conditions (supergreenhouse conditions on land) during the Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event and high sea level at that time.

Most of that carbon sinks to be recycled by microbes, but some enters a wider food web of zooplankton and their predators or diverse seabed life. How much carbon becomes stored long term or buried to become genuinely sequestered varies with a wide range of factors, e.g. geography, history, substratum etc. The Arctic and Antarctic are dynamic and in a phase of rapid but contrasting, complex physical change and marine organismal carbon capture and storage is altering in response. For example, an ice shelf calving a 5000 km2 iceberg actually results in 106 tons of additional blue carbon per year. Polar blue carbon increases have resulted from new and longer climate-forced, phytoplankton blooms driven by sea ice losses and ice shelf collapses. Polar blue carbon gains with sea ice losses are probably the largest natural negative feedback against climate change.

Fluvial saline aquifers are favourite targeted reservoirs for CO$$_{2}$$2 storage. These reservoirs are very heterogeneous but their heterogeneities were rarely integrated into CO$$_{2}$$2 reservoir models. Moreover, contrary to petroleum reservoirs, the available dataset is very limited and not supposed to be enriched. This leads to wide uncertainties on reservoir characteristics required for CSS management injection location, CO$$_{2}$$2 plume migration, etc.. Stochastic simulations are classical strategies in such under-constrained context. They aim at generating a wide number of models that all fit the available dataset. The generated models serve as support for computing the required reservoir characteristics and their uncertainties. A challenge is to optimize the uncertainty computations by selecting stochastic models that should have a priori very different flow behaviours. Fluid flows depend on the connectivity of reservoir rocks channel deposits. In this paper, it is proposed to study the variability of the Betti numbers in function of different fluvial architectures. The aim is to quantify the impact of fluvial heterogeneities and their spatial distribution on reservoir rock topology and then on CO$$_{2}$$2 storage capacities. Representative models of different scenarios of channel stacking and their internal heterogeneities are generated using geostatistical simulation approaches. The Betti numbers are computed on each generated models and statistically analysed to exhibit if fluvial architecture controls reservoir topology.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "65da01e0dc87a8cb0cbbc6af2e33117cb8a89a65", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2911159290", "CorpusId": 135217736}, "title": "Dynamic simulations of carbon dioxide pipeline transportation for the purpose of carbon capture and storage", "abstract": "This Engineering Doctorate project aimed to study the effects of varying flowrates on the flow dynamics of carbon dioxide within a pipeline. \nThe researched utilised the software gCCS to simulate three different transport system.

The outputs from the model showed that when the inlet flowrate is decreased, the outlet flowrate responds in three distinct phases. \nThe second system compared the effects of three different impurities; hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen, on the flow response when the inlet flowrate is decreased. It was found that all three impurities caused an increase in the offset between the inlet and outlet flowrate. \nThe third system looked at how multiple sources of carbon dioxide effect the flowrate within the main trunk pipeline. It was found that multiple sources of carbon dioxide do not affect the flow of CO2 within the pipeline beyond that of the base case. \nThe final part of the research compared data from the Shell QUEST pipeline to the model.

The continued large-scale and widespread consumption of fossil fuels and in particular coal for power generation is necessary to sustain population and economic growth. Amongst a spectrum of measures, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies have the potential to play a key role, in response to climate change, by decarbonizing on a large scale the energy and other industrial sectors. This thesis has been developed in the context of the COMET project, which is funded under the Seventh Framework Program. The COMET project goal is to assess the techno-economic feasibility of integrating carbon dioxide transport and storage infrastructures in the West Mediterranean area. This project jointly coordinated by Portugal, Spain and Morocco considers several development scenarios for these countries energy systems within the time period 2010-2050. These scenarios include the location and development of the energy related and industrial major CO2 point sources and the available potential for geological storage in those countries. The long-term scenarios of the Portuguese, Spanish and Moroccan energy systems are to be modelled and evaluated through the technical economic MARKAL/TIMES models. As part of the COMET project, this thesis presents the quantitative and qualitative input data needed to model the energy system of Morocco via MARKAL/TIMES. The input data includes, among others: energy conversion, consumption and CO2 emissions trends of the energy sector and other industrial activities; the identification of the installed capacity and future perspectives; an assessment of the energy end-use sectors; an estimation of the domestic energy related resources; and an assessment of relevant energy policies as MARKAL/TIMES is well suited to evaluate the global impact of these policies within the energy sector.

Nevertheless, their practical applications are hindered by finite cycle life and inferior rate performance because of large volume expansion, polyselenide dissolution, and sluggish dynamics. Herein, the nitrogen-doped carbon (NC)-coated FeSe2 nanoparticles encapsulated in NC nanoboxes (termed FeSe2@NDC NBs) are fabricated through the facile thermal selenization of polydopamine-wrapped Prussian blue precursors. In this composite, the existing nitrogen-doped dual carbon layer improves the intrinsic conductivity and structural integrity, while the unique porous yolk-shell architecture significantly mitigates the volume swelling during the sodium/desodium process. Moreover, the derived Fe-N-C bonds can effectively capture polyselenide, as well as promote Na+ transportation and good reversible conversion reaction. As expected, the FeSe2@NDC NBs deliver remarkable rate performance (374.9 mA h g-1 at 10.0 A g-1) and long-cycling stability (403.3 mA h g-1 over 2000 loops at 5.0 A g-1). When further coupled with a self-made Na3V2(PO4)3@C cathode in sodium-ion full cells, FeSe2@NDC NBs also exhibit considerably high and stable sodium-storage performance.", "year": 2021}]}
