Mobile devices with high-resolution cameras are now ubiquitous, giving clinicians the opportunity to capture and share images from the bedside. However, secure and efficient ways to manage and share digital images are lacking. Objective The aim of this study is to describe the implementation of a secure application for capturing and storing clinical images in the electronic health record (EHR), and to describe initial user experiences. Methods We developed CliniCam, a secure Apple iOS (iPhone, iPad) application that allows for user authentication, patient selection, image capture, image annotation, and storage of images as a Portable Document Format (PDF) file in the EHR. We leveraged our organization\u2019s enterprise service-oriented architecture to transmit the image file from CliniCam to our enterprise clinical data repository. There is no permanent storage of protected health information on the mobile device. CliniCam also required connection to our organization\u2019s secure WiFi network. Resident physicians from emergency medicine, internal medicine, and dermatology used CliniCam in clinical practice for one month. They were then asked to complete a survey on their experience. We analyzed the survey results using descriptive statistics. Results Twenty-eight physicians participated and 19/28 (68%) completed the survey. Of the respondents who used CliniCam, 89% found it useful or very useful for clinical practice and easy to use, and wanted to continue using the app. Respondents provided constructive feedback on location of the photos in the EHR, preferring to have photos embedded in (or linked to) clinical notes instead of storing them as separate PDFs within the EHR. Some users experienced difficulty with WiFi connectivity which was addressed by enhancing CliniCam to check for connectivity on launch. Conclusions CliniCam was implemented successfully and found to be easy to use and useful for clinical practice. CliniCam is now available to all clinical users in our hospital, providing a secure and efficient way to capture clinical images and to insert them into the EHR.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), the most practical method of them, plays a significant role. However, these methods have the disadvantage of the limits of geographical distribution and high possibility of re-emission into the atmosphere. Recently, ocean storage has been studied using Accelerated Weathering of Limestone (AWL), a technique for storing carbon dioxide in the ocean as an alternative to CCS, an underground storage. AWL is a method of converting carbon dioxide into concentrated water in the form of bicarbonate ion and discharging it to the ocean to dilute and store it. It does not cause re-emission to the atmosphere, and the discharged concentrated water increases the alkalinity of the ocean to prevent marine acidification. The objective of this study was to understand the behavior of DIC (Dissolved Inorganic Carbon) including carbon dioxide during the ocean discharge of bicarbonate ion concentrated water in AWL method.

The technology that holds the most promise for mercury control in low-chlorine lignite to meet the needs of the Clean Air Act in the United States and the Canada-Wide Standards in Canada is injection of treated activated carbon (AC) into the flue gas stream. Most of the treated carbons are reported to be halogenated, often with bromine. Under a previous multiyear project headed by the Energy & Environmental Research Center (EERC), testing was performed on a slipstream unit using actual lignite-derived flue gas to evaluate various sorbent technologies for their effectiveness, performance, and cost. Testing under this project showed that halogenated ACs performed very well, with mercury capture rates often {ge} 90%. However, differences were noted between treated ACs with respect to reactivity and capacity, possibly as a result of storage conditions. Under certain conditions (primarily storage in ambient air), notable performance degradation had occurred in mercury capture efficiency. Therefore, a small exploratory task within this project evaluated possible differences resulting from storage conditions and subsequent effects of aging thatmore\u00a0\u00bb might somehow alter their chemical or physical properties. In order to further investigate this potential degradation of treated (halogenated) ACs, the EERC, together with DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory, the North Dakota Industrial Commission (NDIC), the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), SaskPower, and Otter Tail Power Company, assessed the aging effects of brominated ACs for the effect that different storage durations, temperatures, and humidity conditions have on the mercury sorption capacity of treated ACs. No aging effects on initial capture activity were observed for any carbons or conditions in the investigation. As measured by the 50% breakthrough time, no changes in capacity were observed for Norit LH samples stored frozen and likely none for Norit LH samples stored under high humidity conditions. The major aging effects on capacity for the EERC brominated sample were seen as a decrease in capacity during the first week of storage under high humidity conditions. Storage of the Norit LH and the EERC 5% brominated samples under low humidity conditions resulted in slightly improved capacities. Storage of the 15% brominated sample under high humidity conditions also improved the capacity. Surface analysis using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed some migration of bromine to and from the surface occurred during storage, although no net loss of bromine was observed. The migration to the surface in the case of the 15% brominated carbon correlates with the increased capacity observed for this sample. The XPS elemental speciation data for the EERC brominated carbons showed a trend toward more bromide being formed at the expense of covalent bromine during storage. This was especially great for the 15% and the 5% stored in low humidity. The Norit LH samples did not show this increase in bromide concentration. This is consistent with the lack of change in capacity for the Norit LH during storage. The carbon speciation data showed generally more oxidization of carbon surfaces with storage, especially formation of carboxylate groups. The least increase in carboxylate groups was seen for the Norit LH stored under low humidity, which correlates with its increased capacity. In conclusion, the observed changes in surface chemistry can be related to the minimal changes in capacity observed, but the factors operate in different directions, so the relationships are complex. High-quality x-ray absorption fine structure spectra were obtained for most of the samples. Significant changes were observed in the x-ray absorption near edge structure and extended x-ray absorption fine structure spectra of the stored carbons, but proved difficult to interpret and correlate with structural changes.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "ab9a36544edae3e489fb05925a87eecec45afc18", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2595962694", "DOI": "10.1575/1912/8805", "CorpusId": 132543481}, "title": "Capturing dynamics of marine inorganic carbon fluxes from diurnal to decadal timescales", "abstract": "The marine carbon cycle plays an important role in regulating Earth's climate. The vastness of the open ocean and the large variability in the coastal ocean provide obstacles to accurately quantify storage and transport of inorganic carbon within marine ecosystems and between marine and other earth systems. Thus far, the open ocean has been the only true net sink of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (Catro) emissions. However, ocean storage of CItII(, is not uniformly distributed. Changes in water chemistry in the Northeast Pacific were quantified to estimate the amount of Cantiro stored in this region over the last decade. This additional Ca.thro was found to cause acidification and aragonite saturation horizon shoaling at rates towards the higher end of those found in Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins, making the Northeast Pacific one of the most sensitive regions to the invasion of anthropogenic carbon dioxide. Due to large variability in biogeochemical signals in coastal oceans, it is challenging to accurately assess carbon fluxes across different boundaries, such as tidal exchange between coastal wetlands and coastal oceans. Coastal salt marshes have been suggested to be a large net CO 2 sink, thus designated as a type of \"blue carbon.\" However, accurate and dynamic estimates of carbon fluxes to and from tidal marshes are still premature, particularly carbon fluxes from marshes to the coastal ocean via tidal exchange, often referred to as marsh lateral fluxes. In this thesis, lateral total alkalinity (TA) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) export fluxes were realistically quantified using high frequency time-series, in situ data. High-resolution fluxes permitted a closer look at how marsh generated TA and DIC are being exported over diurnal, spring-neap, and seasonal scales. I investigated the best way to capture variability of marsh exports via traditional bottle sampling and assessed uncertainties associated with different sampling strategies. Marsh TA and DIC exports significantly modified buffering capacity of coastal waters. This work contains the first realistic estimate of TA exports from a tidal salt marsh. Accurate estimates of DIC and TA fluxes indicate the significance of salt marshes to the coastal carbon and alkalinity budgets.

Firstly, autoclave experiments were conducted in environments where the CO2 phase was either saturated or under-saturated with water. Such an approach enabled identification of the minimum water content in the system, below which no general or localised attack was observed. \nLater, corrosion experiments were performed containing supercritical CO2 and the presence of 0, 50 and 100 ppm SO2 with a low level of O2 (20 ppm). The results highlights that reducing water content is a more favourable option compared to reducing SO2 content to minimise corrosion in the system as high corrosion rates can be observed in the absence of SO2 if water content is high enough, but below a minimum water content (~500 ppm), both general and localised corrosion is minimal despite the presence of 100 ppm SO2. \nAnalysis of corrosion products formed on the steel surface is performed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Raman spectroscopy. Only FeCO3 was detected on the surface without SO2 and O2, whilst both FeCO3 and FeSO3.3H2O were identified on the surface of the carbon steel samples exposed to the environments containing 2 and 100 ppm SO2 and 20 ppm O2. The localised corrosion rates were determined by surface profilometry measurement. \nThe most important observation from this work is that the key degradation mechanism in all experiments was localised corrosion. Not only was the combination of SO2 and O2 shown to influence pitting severity, but the pitting rates recorded were nearly one order of magnitude greater than the uniform corrosion rate determined from mass loss measurements. The increase in SO2 content was shown to influence the shape of pits as well as their overall depth.

This effort can be broken down into a few broad categories such as terrestrial, ocean and geologic sequestration.

(A gigaton is a billion metric tons.) There is a sturdy cover of air around our planet. This thick air-tight blanket captures the heat of the earth we find today. CO2 is the main greenhouse gas which controls the temperature of atmosphere. Since 1880, due to increasing carbon percentage in atmosphere Earth temperature is increased by 2\u00b0 Fahrenheit. If we don\u2019t change anything, the effects of climate change as forest fires, the stifling heat waves, and sea level rise will continue to become severe. Here's the big, important thing about CO2: this is a greenhouse gas. That means CO2 in the atmosphere works to trap heat near Earth. It helps the Earth to hold on to some of the energy it receives from the Sun so that all the energy that comes from it does not return to space. If it were not for the effects of global warming, the oceans would be extremely solid. Earth would not be as beautiful a planet blue and green as life. Therefore, CO2 and other greenhouse gases are good to a certain level. An increase in CO2 concentration can help plants to grow faster. But CO2 is so good at trapping heat from the Sun, that even a small increase in CO2 in the atmosphere could cause the Earth to warm up even more. Currently, we\u2019re using some techniques as Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), Direct Air Capture, Carbon Mineralization, and Ocean-based Concepts. But these are not very cost-effective. For instance, direct air capture costs about $94- $232 per metric ton.

Global warming has become a critical issue to our planet, Earth. The continuing rise in the average temperature of the atmosphere and ocean causes serious problems such as: glacier shrinkage, sea level elevation, species extinction, agricultural output decrease, and extreme weather events. It is an indisputable fact that greenhouse gas concentrations resulting from human activities continue to exacerbate global warming. Although water vapor contributes the most to the greenhouse effect, (i.e., the effect of solar heat remaining on our planet), due to industrialization the dramatic increase of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere accounts for the biggest percentage contribution in the temperature rise. According to historic studies regarding the contents of the atmosphere, the mole fraction of CO2 has increased around 36% percent from its preindustrial level; the last 40 years account for more than half of the increase. Many countries, territories, and international organizations have joined together to curb the global warming trend. Among the earliest efforts, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which began in 1992, encompasses the largest number of countries signed to fight climate change. This is despite the fact that the convention is a non-binding treaty with no mandatory limits on emissions. Similar to the UNFCCC protocol, the Kyoto protocol, initiated in 1997, consists of nations around the globe that have signed to reduce their emissions from 1990 benchmark emission levels. Many policies, economic stimuli and technologies have been developed to reduce carbon emissions, considered to be the major factor in global warming. Among the many policies, the three most often debated and tested are that of the carbon tax, the cap-and-trade system, and of renewable portfolio standards. Carbon capture and storage technologies are considered a panacea in reducing the emissions from extensive use of fossil fuels.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "a79456d80c981d83c8d16cf3720c67cb25f6e085", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3184789032", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.3871831", "CorpusId": 237915633}, "title": "Regulations for carbon capture, utilization and storage: Comparative analysis of development in Europe, China and the Middle East", "abstract": "The development of the carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) supply chain will require the establishment of a regulatory and legal regime, both at the international and domestic level, to manage risks at various parts of the supply chain and to support technology investment.

This has led to ecosystem degradation and widespread extinction of plant and animal species. In recognition of this unprecedented human impact, a new geological time period, labeled the Anthropocene, has been defined as the time period during which humans have significantly impacted the Earth's geological and ecological systems (Waters et al., 2016). During the last 40 years, a growing awareness of the negative impacts of humankind on the Earth has led to enactment of government legislation and a degree of modulation of human behavior. However, the emphasis of these changes in attitude and practice has typically been on the conservation of plants and animals, while the effect of anthropogenic activity on natural microbial populations has been largely ignored. This is a significant oversight because microbial communities are generally the first responders to environmental perturbation and can either augment or buffer environmental shifts via, often complex, positive, and negative feedback loops. \n \nMicrobes are the most abundant organisms in aquatic ecosystems playing key roles in ecosystem productivity and biogeochemistry. The impacts of anthropogenic activity on the ecology and function of aquatic microbial assemblages are multifarious and often largely undefined, but the advent of powerful new tools including next generation sequencing and novel modeling approaches has begun to shed light on this important question (Hunt and Ward; Tan et al.). The publications presented in this Research Topic are diverse with many, perhaps unsurprisingly, that address the impacts of two of the most important problems facing microbes in aquatic systems, climate change, and pollution. \n \nOne of the major impacts of climate change on marine and aquatic ecosystems is an increase in sea surface temperature (SST). In their contribution, Tout et al. demonstrated that increasing SST disrupts the Pocillopora damicornis coral microbiome, increasing the occurrence of Vibrio species and in particular the coral pathogen V. corallilyticus. In light of previous evidence that V. corallilyticus can lead to coral bleaching (Ben-Haim and Rosenberg, 2002), these patterns provide evidence for an additional mechanism in the mass bleaching events that occur during elevated SSTs. Similar observations of increasing influence of microbial pathogens due to rising SST are being made in other systems. The Petton et al. contribution demonstrated that increasing SSTs are increasing the threat to an important aquaculture species, the Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea gigas), which was found to be more susceptible to the ostreid herpes virus (OsHV-1) at an elevated SST. As with the Tout et al. study, disruption of the C. gigas microbiome and replacement with Vibrio species was revealed to be an important factor in the full expression of disease by OsHV-1 (Petton et al.). \n \nIn Europe, warming SST has led to increases in Vibrio infections in both humans and marine animals (summarized in Le Roux et al.), which catalyzed the first European workshop (Paris, 2015) aimed at forming a research network to improve understanding of the factors driving Vibrio disease events and their impact on human and ecosystem health and, food security (Le Roux et al.). Vibrio disease events and pathogen evolution are inextricably linked to how humans interact with their aquatic environment. For example, the dense human population and low-lying geography of the river deltas is hypothesized to have allowed regular intrusion of Vibrio cholerae into human drinking water allowing for adaptation of this deadly pathogen to the human gut (Boucher et al.). Based on the conclusions of the workshop, rising SSTs are likely to result in increased and/or more severe disease outbreaks requiring further research to develop strategies for prevention and mitigation. Continuing with the theme of climate change, a potential partial solution to this problem is CO2 capture and storage in sub-seabed reservoirs however, Rastelli et al. sounded a warning that CO2 leakage from such reservoirs could significantly impact benthic microbial communities affecting carbon cycling and nutrient regeneration processes. \n \nIn addition to the effects of climate change, anthropogenically-derived water pollution is another major impact within aquatic ecosystems. Contributions to this special issue indicate that influx of pollutants and nutrients into aquatic systems significantly disrupts the structure and function of natural microbial assemblages, leading to reduced species diversity, increased heterotrophy and rises in the numbers of potentially virulent/toxic microbes (Moreira et al.; Quero et al.; Jeffries et al.). Some of these localized pollution events can also amplify the effects of global-scale climate change, by further stimulating events such as the Vibrio blooms described above or cyanobacterial or algal blooms that lead to mortality of aquatic animals through anoxia or production of toxins (Rastogi et al.). \n \nBeyond nutrient pollution, antibiotics and antibiotic-resistance genes are emerging as significant pollutants in aquatic ecosystems (Zhang et al.). The worsening antimicrobial resistance crisis is now being acknowledged as a One Health issue where under this concept, the health of humans is recognized as being inextricably linked to animal and environmental health. In an environmental context, aquatic environments are a major reservoir for resistant microbes and resistance genes as a result of excessive use of antimicrobials and untreated effluent streams (Michael et al., 2014). Sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics in aquatic environments promote antibiotic resistance in bacteria and significant changes in DNA sequence (e.g., mutation) and genome architecture such as inversions and deletions in the bacterial chromosome (Chow et al.) and, affect biogeochemical cycles (Balcazar et al.). Furthermore, natural biofilms are reservoirs for resistance genes with the close proximity of bacteria to one another promoting lateral gene transfer processes (Balcazar et al.). More research is required to elucidate the role of antibiotic waste on ecological systems and what impact these resistance reservoirs have in promoting antibiotic resistance in clinical environments. \n \nA key point raised by Jeffries et al. is that we lack benchmark data for many of our urbanized estuaries, limiting our ability to assess the impact of anthropogenic activity on these important and valued ecosystems. We also do not know whether a microbial community can be restored following a disturbance (chronic or acute) and what impact industrial pollutants have on the biogeochemistry of an environment (Quero et al.). Although not a result of pollution, these questions are answered in part by Bernhard et al. who reported that disturbance of a natural community due to tidal restrictions had long-lasting impact on sediment nitrogen-cycling bacterial communities even 30 years after restoration. Tan et al. also addressed the question of how artificial urban structures affect microbial assemblages. Regarding restoration, Aracic et al. reviewed numerous currently available biological approaches that could be applied. However, new methods are required to understand how microbial communities shift when disturbed to better understand the resilience of microbial communities and to assist in identifying the best ways of restoring them. Within this context, Tan et al. examined the utility of next generation sequencing approaches for assessing water quality, while Hunt and Ward presented a promising network modeling approach for predicting how disturbances transmit through microbial interactions. Both of these studies provide crucial direction for future studies in determining how anthropogenic processes disturb microbial communities and how (if possible) do we restore them. \n \nOur aquatic ecosystems are highly valued as sources of food (Lu et al.) and recreation (Jeffries et al.) however, they are experiencing unprecedented levels of impacts from human activities particularly those of pollution and climate change processes. The diverse contributions to this Research Topic have highlighted the extent to which natural communities of aquatic microorganisms are faced with environmental perturbation and degradation as a consequence of human activities. With more research and better understanding combined with better public awareness and government policy (Rastogi et al.), improved management of, and restoration of these environments can proceed. The impetus for such change is not easily found, however, aquatic environments are often, and increasingly, highly valued by the human populations living near to them. With effective public communication, this can be used to drive change, as is happening in the 2016 Olympic city of Rio de Janeiro with its massive restoration of Guanabara Bay (Fistarol et al.). \n \nWe thank all of the participating authors for their contributions to this issue, which we believe will be a valuable resource as aquatic ecosystems continue to experience increasing anthropogenic impacts into the future.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "e40e7ef9a300586ddae8aca5a47f28b6066dc11e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3010533464", "CorpusId": 217404701}, "title": "Exploring modeling concepts to deal with carbon source - sink relationships in EcoMeristem: implications for analyzing the phenotypic variability of biomass sorghum", "abstract": "The sorghum plant can produce great amount of stem biomass due to the elaboration of one main stem made of thick and large internodes possibly associated with few tillers, depending on the genotype and the environment (GxE). Depending on GxE as well, Carbon (C) is differentially allocated to stem internode structural (lignocellulosic) and non-structural (sugar) components, making stem biomass appropriate to diverse end-uses (feed, energy, bioproducts...). Then optimizing C resource acquisition and allocation to stem component sinks is a major challenge for sorghum breeding toward the conception of plant ideotypes. By accounting for traits involved in C source-sink relations in a dynamic way and at the organ level, FSPM can be of major interest to support the analysis of biomass sorghum phenotypes. EcoMeristem model is designed for this purpose. It simulates plant and crop performance (biomass, sugar, grain) as the result of GxE acting on C sink activity (organ size and number, dynamically set-up in plant topology) and their regulation by their competition for a common pool of C resource within the plant, computed in a simple way at crop level (Beer-Lambert for light interception, Monteith for its conversion into C). This model, initially developed for rice, was recently tested for its ability to capture the phenotypic variability met across eight contrasted genotypes of biomass sorghum. Whereas tiller number, stem and leaf biomass at whole plant level were correctly modelled, biomass partitioning between the main stem and tiller(s) was unreliable: nonstructural (C stored) and a minor extent structural biomass of the main stem was reduced to the benefit of tiller stem growth, suggesting some limits in the way C source acquisition and/or C sink rules of dominance among culms. The aim of the present study was to evaluate concepts for representing C source-sink relationships in EcoMeristem and better capturing the phenotypic variability of biomass sorghum. For this purpose, the current concepts used in this model were compared to more detailed approaches enabling to differentiate the culms with respect to C source and/or sink activity. Regarding C source acquisition, a light interception model taking into account canopy closure dynamics (from isolated plant to row and closed canopy) and horizontal canopy layers defined by leaf age, temperature and sunlit/shaded ratio, was implemented. It was combined with a photosynthesis model inspired from Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry's model to compute C assimilation at leaf level. These modules together enable to compute C supply either at whole plant or culm level. Regarding C sink activity, an exploratory formalism was implemented that prioritized C sinks (i.e. growing organs and C storage in internodes) for their access to C resource, according to the age of the culm they belong to (proxy of apical dominance). These different C source and sink related concepts are currently compared to a dedicated field data set. This data set deals with two genotypes and tiller pruning treatments to evaluate the competition between main stem and tiller growth. Accordingly, these source-sink concepts are being benchmarked regarding their ecophysiological relevance and computation time efficiency.

Both cases would involve a complete transition of the global energy system to zero-emission technologies like renewables or nuclear power at unprecedented rates. This complex challenge can only be analyzed with energy system models, i.e. large computer models that can generate future energy scenarios. This thesis presents five papers that develop methodology for modeling the global energy transition. In papers 1-2, we develop new methods for representing technological development of emerging technologies like solar or wind power in energy models. We use \u201cexperience curves\u201d, empirical relationships that describe how costs tend to fall for new technologies as a function of their market growth. We find that by investing in solar and wind at a global scale we can drive down costs to a point where they compete with conventional fossil energy sources. Paper 3 is a study of meeting climate targets with bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) using an integrated energy-climate model. BECCS is a technology that can produce negative emissions; i.e., it can deliver energy while actively removing CO2 from the atmosphere. We find that if BECCS is used on a global scale, it can significantly reduce costs of meeting the 1.5\u00b0C target and potentially reverse global warming in the long run.

Yet scholarly accounts of CCU feasibility are rare.

Preliminary cost estimates are as low as $68 per tonne C sequestered, as compared to > $$170 per tonne C estimated for other approaches to CO{sub 2} separation with geologic or deep-ocean storage. Engineers at McDermott Technologies, Inc., have independently estimated the cost of our proposed technique, and came to the conclusion that our cost estimates were at the high end of the likely range. Interest has been expressed in pursuing this approach further both in Norway and in Japan. We have proved the viability of our concept using (1) bench-top laboratory experiments (Figures 1 and 2), (2) computer modeling of those experiments, (3) more sophisticated cost estimates, and (4) three-dimensional computer modeling of the consequences to global ocean chemistry (Figure 3 and 4). The climate and environmental impacts of our current, carbon intensive energy usage demands that effective and practical energy alternatives and CO{sub 2} mitigation strategies be found. As part of this effort, various means of capturing and storing CO{sub 2} generated from fossil-fuel-based energy production are being investigated (e.g. [3,4]). One of the proposed methods involves a geochemistry-based capture and sequestration process [5,6] that hydrates point-source, waste CO{sub 2} with water to produce a carbonic acid solution. This in turn is reacted and neutralized with limestone, thus converting the original CO{sub 2} gas to calcium bicarbonate in solution, the overall reaction being: CO{sub 2(g)} + H{sub 2}O{sub (l)} + CaCO{sub 3(s)} {yields} Ca{sub (aq)}{sup 2+} + 2HCO{sub 3(aq)}{sup -} The dissolved calcium bicarbonate produced is then released and diluted in the ocean where it would add minimally to the large, benign pool of these ions already present in seawater. Such a process is geochemically equivalent to continental and marine carbonate weathering which will otherwise naturally consume anthropogenic CO{sub 2}, but over many millennia (e.g. [7,8,9]). We identify the enhanced form of this process as Accelerated Weathering of Limestone or accelerated carbonate dissolution. Previously, it has been shown that accelerated carbonate dissolution can effectively convert a significant fraction of US CO{sub 2} emissions to long-term storage as bicarbonate in the ocean, while avoiding or possibly reversing environmental impacts associated with either the ongoing passive or the proposed active injection of CO{sub 2} into the ocean [6,10]. Being analogous to the widespread use of wet limestone to desulfurize flue gas, accelerated carbonate dissolution reactors could be retrofitted to many existing coastal power plants at a typical cost estimated to be $$20-$30/tonne CO{sub 2} mitigated [5,11].

This method is expected to reduce the energy requirement compared with the conventional method. In our previous study, effects of pore size and thickness of porous hollow fiber membrane on the CO2 desorption rate in the membrane flash process were investigated. As a result, the CO2 desorption rate increased with increasing the membrane thickness and decreasing the pore size.

For large-point sources, such as those found in power generation, the carbon dioxide capture techniques being investigated by the in-house research area of the National Energy Technology Laboratory possess the potential for improved efficiency and costs as compared to more conventional technologies. The investigated techniques can have wide applications, but the research has focused on capture/separation of carbon dioxide from flue gas (postcombustion from fossil fuel-fired combustors) and from fuel gas (precombustion, such as integrated gasification combined cycle \u2013 IGCC). With respect to fuel gas applications, novel concepts are being developed in wet scrubbing with physical absorption; chemical absorption with solid sorbents; and separation by membranes. In one concept, a wet scrubbing technique is being investigated that uses a physical solvent process to remove CO2 from fuel gas of an IGCC system at elevated temperature and pressure. The need to define an ideal solvent has led to the study of the solubility and mass transfer properties of various solvents. Fabrication techniques and mechanistic studies for hybrid membranes separating CO2 from the fuel gas produced by coal gasification are also being performed. Membranes that consist of CO2-philic silanes incorporated into an alumina support or ionic liquids encapsulated into a polymeric substrate have been investigated for permeability and selectivity. An overview of two novel techniques is presented along with a research progress status of each technology. INTRODUCTION Carbon sequestration is a viable alternative to reduce the emissions of the greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, from large point sources. It holds the potential to provide deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. As mentioned in the Carbon Sequestration Program, managed by the U.S. Department of Energy, of particular interest are power generation point sources that use fossil fuels.[1] Since nearly one-third of the anthropogenic CO2 emissions are produced by these facilities, conventional coal-burning power plants and advanced power generation plants, such as integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC), present opportunities where carbon can be removed and then permanently stored. Although pulverized coal-fired-base steam cycles have been the predominant electric power generation technology for many years, it is projected that advanced power generation technologies (for example, gasification-based IGCC) will make in-roads in the power generation sector in the near future. FutureGen, a power and chemical generation system with negligible atmospheric emissions, is just one example of future gasification-based systems.[2] In IGCC power plants, a fossil fuel is reacted with oxygen and steam in a gasifier to produce a fuel gas (also frequently referred to as synthesis gas or syngas) consisting mainly of carbon monoxide and hydrogen. This mixture is then cleaned and burned to generate power in a gas turbine combined cycle. The high efficiency of this process can be exploited by fuels, such as residual oil and coal.[3] Plants consist basically of three main building blocks: coal gasification, gas cleaning, and power generation.[4] A process diagram can be seen in Figure 1. Assuming oxygen-blown gasification with coal (near pure oxygen is used to eliminate the pressurization of the diluent nitrogen), the main products of the gasification process are CO, H2, CO2, H2O, H2S, some gaseous hydrocarbons, and trace amounts of certain pollutants, including mercury. The gas cleanup system of the plant involves particulate removal and acid gas scrubbing. In a typical IGCC plant, the crude fuel gas is first fed to a facility to remove the particulates from the gas stream. The gas leaving the particulates scrubber is then cooled and dewatered and, at this point, consists mainly of CO, H2, and CO2. It also contains the acid gas H2S, which will be removed in the desulfurization system. The acid gas scrubbing process (cold gas cleanup in Figure 1) is generally designed for the removal of sulfur-bearing compounds with very little CO2 removed in the process. However, removal of CO2 at this location is possible. Some designs employ sulfur-tolerant shift catalysts followed by acid gas removal at low temperatures. This approach is preferable when CO2 recovery is desired due to the increase in CO2 partial pressure after the shift reaction.[5] The power generation consists of a gas turbine system followed by a steam turbine bottoming cycle. The desulfurized gas is first injected with steam and partially expanded in gas expanders to recover some work. The partially expanded gas, which is rich in CO and H2, is then burned with air and expanded in a gas turbine to recover more work. The residual thermal energy in the gas turbine exhaust is used to produce steam for the steam turbine bottoming cycle. Figure 1: General Case: Advanced Gasification/IGCC \u2013 Fuel Gas The upper flow path in Figure 1 indicates the option where acid gas cleaning occurs within a warm gas cleanup system rather than at the previously described cold (lower) temperatures. The main advantage in cleaning the gas in an IGCC application at higher temperature is that the thermal plant efficiency will be as much as 2-3% greater as compared to the lower temperature acid gas cleaning scenario.[5] The areas of efficiency improvements are that the transfer of heat and latent heat to the more efficient gas turbine cycle are maximized; the capital and operating costs are lowered by reducing the duty on the heat exchangers; and the need for waste water treatment facilities are eliminated.[6] With respect to CO2 capture in an IGCC system, post-combustion and pre-combustion technologies can be used. With coal utilization and after the gas turbine, about 9% carbon dioxide exists in the flue gas and partial pressure of the carbon dioxide is low. However, precombustion techniques with the IGCC system offer the opportunity to remove CO2 from the fuel gas before it is combusted in the turbine. The high pressure of the system and the possible shifting of the CO to CO2 produce a high partial pressure of CO2 that could be advantageous with certain removal technologies. In a carbon sequestration scenario, the cost of the capture/separation step is much higher than that of the storage step.[1] For IGCC systems, commercial processes for CO2 removal, such as Selexol, are used as a baseline from which other capture technologies can be compared. The U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) is conducting in-house research investigating novel techniques to capture/separate CO2 from gases from advanced power generation systems. These technologies fall within the process categories of wet scrubbing with physical absorption; chemical absorption or adsorption with solid sorbents; and separation by membranes. Except for membranes, all capture technique must be regenerable due to the excessive amount of carbon dioxide produced in a power generation plant. With respect to the first category, physical solvents for CO2 removal at high temperatures in IGCC applications are being studied. The higher temperature of operation for these solvents enhances the thermal efficacy of the IGCC power generation system. Depressurization or flashing of the CO2 from the rich solvent is the means for regeneration. (See \u201cSOL\u201d in Figure 1.) The use of solid sorbents is another method to remove CO2 from gas streams. Past work has included alkali and alkaline earth metals as the basic component of sorbent structures. [7] These sorbents could be used in higher temperature absorption processes. More recent work has included lower temperature sorbents for potential use as a substitute for the Selexol process. The regeneration step is crucial for these types of sorbents and either pressure swing and/or temperature swing can be effectively utilized. Regenerable low temperature sorbents that operate below 300F are identified as \u201cLTS\u201d in Figure 1 whereas regenerable high temperature sorbents \u201cHTS\u201d operate above an arbitrary 300F level. The 300F cutoff temperature was arbitrary since, in an IGCC application, this temperature typifies the lower end of the warm gas range for obtaining the 2-3% thermal efficiency advantage. Another method is separation of carbon dioxide from fuel gas by the use of a membrane system. Simplicity, flexibility, the ability to maintain high CO2 pressure, and the potential to perform separations at low energy penalties make membranes interesting for CO2 removal for IGCC applications. In addition to the standard requirement of obtaining high permeability, challenges exist in the development of membranes capable of selectively separating CO2 from the process gas stream. In addition, the reducing conditions and the presence of water and various minor contaminants necessitate the design of membranes with exceptional chemical and physical stability. (See \u201cMEM\u201d in Figure 1 as a potential location for these membranes.) Development of hybrid membranes for the separation of CO2 presents a method that can satisfy the requirements for a durable membrane, especially at elevated temperatures.[8-10] The research status of two of the above novel capture technologies that fall within the inhouse research area at NETL are described below along with implications of the experimental research on technical direction and costs. An overview of these novel techniques is presented.

Study participants were selected using a purposive sampling technique to explore the opinions of personnel working in three oil-related agencies: Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Ministry of Petroleum Resources and Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas. Information collected from existing literature and related reports on CCUS were critically analysed, whereas data from semi-structured interviews were generated by audio-recording of participants\u2019 responses. These responses were transcribed from audio recordings for each participant and quality controlled by ensuring that transcripts matched the respective responses. Transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis, exploring the research theme using both theory and practice. The theoretical framework utilised PESTEL and SWOT analyses to evaluate the macro environment and the internal and external environment of CCUS implementation in Nigeria. PESTEL analysis showed that CCUS implementation in Nigeria is driven by various regulatory and policy frameworks, lack of adequate capital, public acceptance and infrastructure. Similarly, the SWOT analysis showed that Nigeria has enough coal reserves that could serve as a potential for CCUS implementation. However, Nigeria\u2019s weaknesses include lack of expertise in CCUS technology, inadequate capital for CCUS investment and policy summersaults by successive governments. Nigeria should thus consider the introduction of subsidies to mitigate various barriers and challenges that hinder CCUS implementation, e.g., low tax rate for enterprises involved in CCUS implementation. There is also urgent need to improve funding of CCUS implementation through foreign direct investment or by the equity market.

Cabin Creek Ranch, near Shepherd, MT offers a rich opportunity to understand the current carbon balance within various land cover types, and to determine the effect that cropping, grazing and concentrated feeding has on the potential for ranch soils to sequester additional carbon. Samples were collected from 30 soil and 16 vegetation locations, which were randomly chosen in a variety of cover types. Soil samples were taken every 15cm throughout the soil profile (down to 100cm, if possible). Four .25m frames were used to collect herbaceous material 25 meters in each cardinal direction from soil pit center. Clay and land cover type were found to have a significant interaction on the organic carbon content in the soils (p=0.021). Additionally, dryland crop was found to be significantly different in organic carbon content compared to other cover types (p<0.0001). Therefore, management towards a specific land cover type could help mitigate CO2 emissions. For example, revegetating dryland crop fields to a native grassland, sagebrush or forest, the landscape would be able to store 230%, 232% and 256% more organic carbon, respectively. Understanding the carbon balance on the landscape scale contributes to understanding the global carbon balance to help mitigate burning of fossil fuels. 1 WHY CONDUCT A CARBON INVENTORY? In 2003, North America contributed 27% (1,856 million metric tons) to total global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, 85% of those emissions were from the United States (1578 million metric tons of CO2), 9% from Canada (167 million metric tons of CO2) and 6% from Mexico (111 million metric tons of CO2). The single largest contributor of these emissions in North America is the combustion of fossil fuels for commercial energy, accounting for 780 million metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2003. The second largest contributor in North America is transportation, accounting for 575 million metric tons of CO2 emissions in 2003 (CCSP, 2007). However, North America has globally important sinks as well. In 2003, North American vegetation removed 530 million tons of carbon per year and stored it as plant material and soil organic matter (CCSP, 2007; Derner and Schuman, 2007). This storage or sink removed 30% of the CO2 emissions from the atmosphere. The remaining 1,335 million metric tons of carbon per year means North America is a net source of atmospheric CO2. This disparity requires actions focused on reducing fossil fuel emissions, in which an array of policy instruments at local, regional, national and international levels will need to be implemented (CCSP, 2007). The combustion of fossil fuels in the last century has created an imbalance in the cycling of carbon through the atmosphere, land, freshwater, and marine environments (CCSP, 2007). Land conversion from forests to agricultural fields, and other land-use changes, has also released stored carbon back to the atmosphere (Billings, 2006; CCSP, 2007; Elmore and Asner, 2006; Jones and Donnelly, 2004; Liao et al. 2006; Zhang et al. 2 2011; Davidson and Ackerman, 1993), affecting other ecosystem processes, such as water quality, nutrient cycling and ecosystem health (Derner and Schuman, 2007). Changes in land use also change soil structure (Chan et al 2003), affecting the carbon storage capacity of soils, potentially increasing the amount of CO2 emissions (Bronick and Lal, 2005). This change is important because soils can store twice as much carbon as the atmosphere, and 2.5 times as much as plants, making soils an important factor in the capture and storage of carbon on local as well as global scales. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) by soils follows two general pathways; terrestrial and geologic. Geologic carbon is permanently stored in underground rock formations, preventing the release back to the atmosphere (CCSP, 2007). Terrestrial carbon is stored in forests and other vegetation or in the soils of farmland, cropland, rangeland and other organic soils (IPCC, 2000). Because geologic formations exist below soils, management has limited effect on the geologic carbon stocks. However, terrestrial carbon can be manipulated to enhance storage or to limit the release of CO2 back to the atmosphere. There are two approaches to storing carbon in terrestrial ecosystems: 1) protecting ecosystems that already store carbon in a way that stocks are maintained or increased and 2) managing soils and vegetation to increase CCS beyond current conditions. The terrestrial CCS processes represent approaches that land managers can manipulate to help mitigate rising atmosphere CO2 through ecosystem rather than hard engineering processes. Understanding the basics of CCS is important, but being able to implement these management recommendations can be challenging. Management practices that limit the 3 amount of disturbance can increase carbon storage within soils. However, soils and vegetation are variable across time and space, and not understanding the fundamental processes occurring while trying to capture and store carbon can be detrimental. Understanding the processes that influence the distribution of carbon across the landscape can allow us to ameliorate the consequences of anthropogenic disturbances to the carbon cycle and the feedback loop of global climate change (Jobb\u00e1gy and Jackson, 2000; Throop et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2011). One way of understanding the processes controlling carbon distribution is to look at the carbon balance on a landscape scale and determine the storage potential of certain landscapes. Multiple studies have shown the distribution of soil organic carbon (SOC) through the soil column is a function of both climate and vegetation (Jobb\u00e1gy and Jackson, 2000, 2001; Throop et al., 2012). Plant characteristics, such as, biomass cycling rates, aboveand below-ground biomass distribution, root distribution and maximum rooting depth all play important roles in determining soil carbon profiles (Jobb\u00e1gy and Jackson, 2001). Because these attributes differ among species, differences in vegetation community composition can dictate the distribution of soil organic carbon across the landscape (Hall et al., 2012; Jackson et al., 2002; Lal, 2005; Rau et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011). Therefore, it is important to understand the role that different types of vegetation play in incorporating carbon into the soils for long-term storage. Determining the amount of carbon that can be sequestered based on vegetation community provides managers an easier target for landscape management. 4 The purpose of this study was to determine the current inventory of carbon associated with various vegetation or land cover types on a ranch located in south central Montana. The current owner wants to use the property to mitigate CO2 emissions, so it is important to have an initial carbon inventory. This inventory will serve as a baseline for evaluating the effect management may have on future incorporation of carbon into the soil/vegetation system. Because of the perceived relationship between plant community and carbon distribution across the landscape, a clear picture of which vegetation communities can capture and store the most carbon will direct management practices that can offset CO2 emissions. With this guidance, management, in turn, would help mitigate the rising levels of atmospheric CO2.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "067cf8c4528347f02d72af5be52b1b7c84c57b84", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1933910569", "CorpusId": 129357047}, "title": "RRS James Cook Cruise 77, 02 -28 Sep 2012.

The project aims to develop a \u201cBest environmental practice\u201d for the carbon capture and storage (CCS) industry. CCS has been proposed as a means of mitigating climate change by storing CO2 in geological reservoirs. The UK has identified sub-seabed storage as the most likely CCS process to be used. Other countries such as the US and Germany are pursuing land based CCS geological storage. Two types of reservoirs have been identified, saline aquifers such as Slepiner or depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs (oil and gas fields). The storage process require a monitoring strategy to ensure that any storage site is effectively monitored to ensure no leakage, or if there is leakage, to detect and monitor the effect of that leakage on the marine environment. \n \nThe Sleipner site in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea is one of the longest operated CCS sites in Europe. It uses CO2 that has been separated from the natural gas from the Sleipner West Field and injects it into a saline aquifer in a permeable sand body called the Utsira sand. The aquifer is capped by a seal of shale and is thought to be impermeable. The depth of the aquifer is 900 m below the seafloor with 80m of water. This storage site has been in operation since 1996 and contains more than 14 million m3 of CO2 with more being continually added. The site has been monitored mainly though the use of seismic on regular intervals to produce \u201c4D\u201d maps of the distribution of the CO2 though the reservoir. These models show a migration of the plume of CO2 to the north west. \n \nJC077 takes a multidisciplinary approach to assess the Sleipner area for signs of leakage from the existing CCS reservoir. We will use a combination of AUV technology with a suite of sensors to determine if leakage is already occurring from the Sleipner field and if so to examine the effects of such leakage. The use of the AUV Autosub allows us to survey areas of the seabed at a resolution that is simply not possible by other means over a comparable time frame. The newly developed pH, pCO2 and Eh sensors attached to Autosub allow us to detect sites of leakage if it is occurring. Chirp and sidescan sonar mounted on Autosub would also allow the identification of sub-seabed and seabed features of interest. In conjunction with this we will use ship based multibeam and EK60 to look for leakage sites, and use water and sediment sampling systems to examine the state of the environment at present, and examine any areas of leakage detected.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "53ffe887dc0517bd00669a9b3de3ed3212958bf3", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 212722727}, "title": "Appliction of Geophysical Techniques in Co2 Sequetration", "abstract": "The major options under consideration for mitigation of green house gas emissions included switching to non carbon based sources of energy increased, energy efficiency, energy conservation and terristial or biotic sequestration of carbon dioxide.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is proposed to be one of the best ways to reduce the impact of CO2 emissions (Kristoffersen et al. 2008).

CO2 injection in deep formations has a long track record. Tertiary EOR with CO2 2 was first used at large scale at the SACROC field to produce stranded oil following primary and secondary production (water flooding). Because CO2 mixes with oil and changes oil properties, CO2 floods are effective at producing additional oil following water flooding. Carbon dioxide is a valuable commodity both because of its ability to stimulate oil production from depleted reservoirs, and because of the limited volumes of naturally-sourced CO2 in the U.S. Therefore, during large-scale commercial floods, CO2 that is produced with oil during EOR is separated, compressed and re-injected and recycled numerous times. Venting to the atmosphere is a rare event, quantifiable, and constitutes an insignificant fraction of the injected CO2. The CO2 purchased mass, net any venting during EOR activity is sequestered in the reservoir by a combination of capillary, solution and physical trapping mechanisms. Approximately 600 million metric tonnes of purchased CO2 have been utilized in the southwest U.S. Permian Basin (PB) alone, the rough equivalent of 30 years worth of CO2 from a half dozen medium-sized coal-fired power plants. Although CO2 EOR technology is mature in the U.S., many reservoir targets have not been flooded because of limited CO2 supply. Moreover, very large newly discovered EOR resources, known as -flooded intervals below the oil-water contact in reservoirs that possess pore space containing immobile oil. ROZs are also now being documented in geologic settings without overlying conventional oil and gas accumulations. ROZ exploration and production using CO2 promises the supplemental capacity to accept very large volumes of CO2 in order to access and produce the remaining immobilized oil. Many existing EOR sites may be ideal for sequestration because they: 1) provide known traps that have held hydrocarbons over geologic time, 2) provide existing CO2 transportation and injection infrastructure, 3) occur in areas where the general public widely accepts injection projects, 4) provide CO2 Available online at www.sciencedirect.com Bruce Hill et al. / Energy Procedia 37 ( 2013 ) 6808 \u2013 6830 6809 commoditization capability for capturing companies, 5) facilitate management of underground CO2 plumes, 6) have proven reservoir injectivity, 7) may offer additional stacked storage potential, and, 8) are advantageous for monitoring because of available well infrastructure, experienced service company presence, and dense pre-injection data. Despite these advantages, in order to assure long-term containment of CO2 for atmospheric purposes and related CO2 reduction credits, the following best practices will ensure credit for captured and sequestered CO2: 1) demonstrate the appropriateness of the reservoir and existing wells for long term CO2 storage (integrity of the reservoir and seal, and identifying/remediating existing penetrations that are historically documented as the highest risk for unexpected pathways for CO2 to the surface), 2) evaluate well construction practices to ensure they are compatible with long-term exposure to low pH fluids (carbonic acid), 3) account for the net CO2 volumes storedseparately from the volumes purchased and recycled, and 4) demonstrate the long2 plume in the subsurface through flood surveillance, monitoring and careful site closure. EOR provides a readily available pathway to large volume storage though oil production offsetting major capital costs of capture facility and pipeline construction, boosting public acceptance through experience and community benefits. Moreover, after completion of EOR operations, sequestration activities can be continued via maximizing CO2 storage in the depleted field, and by injection into qualified and associated brine formations. \u00a9 2013 Bruce Hill, Susan Hovorka, Steve Melzer.

In the first plant, CO2 capture is done using a double-stage Selexol absorption process while in the second plant, CO2 capture is done using the novel chemical looping combustion (CLC) process.

This means that CLC-based plant is more economically competitive than double-stage Selexol-based plant. The effect of different degrees of decarbonisation on the performance of the double-stage Selexol-based plant showed that the efficiency of the IGCC plant increases with reducing the degree of decarbonisation.

The cement industry recognizes a variety of approaches to reduce the emissions intensity of the cement produced and used [IEA 2009]. The thermal and electrical efficiency of cement production can be improved by deploying the best available technology in new cement plants and retrofits. Alternative and less carbon-intensive fuels can be used as the energy source. The rate of substitution in blended cements can be maximized. Finally, carbon capture and storage (CCS) can capture cement industry CO2 emissions before they are released and store them permanently. The industry has previously recognized a number of approaches to reduce the emissions intensity of the cement produced and used in concrete. Fourth International Conference on Sustainable Construction Materials and Technologies http://www.claisse.info/Proceedings.htm It is clear, however, that practical limits on the impacts of these measures mean that it will be difficult [Barcelo 2014] to attain the industry goal to reduce emissions 50% below 2006 levels by 2050 that is outlined in the IEA & WBCSD roadmap [IEA 2009]. Innovative approaches are sought and are likely to be a part of a portfolio strategy. The biggest improvements in efficiency and cement substitution are likely already known. Future developments will result in incremental emissions improvements. Therefore, innovative approaches are sought that can be a part of a portfolio strategy. One potential measure is to employ the beneficial reaction between carbon dioxide and freshly hydrating cement. If an industrial process could successfully use carbon dioxide as a feedstock in the production of concrete building products there could be widely distributed carbon utilization serving to effectively \u2018close the loop\u2019 for the carbon dioxide emitted during the cement production. The mechanism of carbonation of freshly hydrating cement was studied more than 35 years ago at the University of Illinois [Goodbrake et al. 1979]. The primary calcium silicate phases in cement were shown to react with carbon dioxide, in the presence of water, to form calcium carbonate and calcium silicate hydrate gel as shown in Equations 1 and 2: 3CaO\u2219SiO2 + (3-x)CO2 + yH2O \u2192 xCaO\u2219SiO3\u2219yH2O + (3-x)CaCO3 (1) 2CaO\u2219SiO2 + (2-x)CO2 + yH2O \u2192 xCaO\u2219SiO3\u2219yH2O + (2-x)CaCO3 (2) The carbonation reactions are exothermic. The reaction proceeds in the aqueous state when Ca ions from the cementitious phases interact with CO3 ions from the applied gas. When the calcium silicates carbonate, the formed CaCO3 is understood to be intermixed with calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H) gel [Berger et al. 1972]. C-S-H gel formation occurs even in an ideal case of \u03b2-C2S and C3S exposed to a 100% CO2 according to the observation that the amount of calcium silicate that reacts exceeds the amount that is attributable to the formation of the carbonate products [Goodbrake et al. 1979]. The reaction of carbon dioxide with a mature concrete microstructure is conventionally acknowledged to be a durability issue due to such effects such as reduced pore solution pH, and carbonation induced corrosion. In contrast, a carbonation reaction integrated into concrete production reacts CO2 with freshly hydrating cement, rather than the hydration phases present in mature concrete, and does not have the same effects. Rather, by virtue of adding gaseous CO2 to freshly mixing concrete the carbonate reaction products are anticipated to form in situ, are of nano-scale and homogenously distributed. Lab work using isothermal calorimetry identified the potential performance benefit of using an optimized low dose of carbon dioxide to promote the development of finely distributed carbonate reaction products. It was concluded that a small dose of carbon dioxide could feasibly be used to provide performance benefits in ready-mixed concrete.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "8f0c88463ba530fae6379535754d296ad0e5dbf0", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 222464758}, "title": "Pressurized loop reactor for effective absorption of CO2: A process development study", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is considered to be one of the main solutions for reducing anthropogenic CO2. CCS includes CO2 capture from a point source, such as power plants, and transportation to a suitable site, where it is stored permanently and safely. Many projects for CO2 storage are based on direct injection of CO2 into underground formations, where it is stored by hydrodynamic, solubility, or mineral trapping. However, the development of CO2 geological storage has been slow with respect to potential environmental impact and regulation for CO2 injection and monitoring. Moreover, some countries, such as Finland and India, do not have sufficient storage capacity or lack suitable storage formations. Therefore, there has been increasing interest in CO2 storage in the form of mineral carbonation. Though many methods are being used in carbonation process, it needs longer time to react with alkali salts. In order to reduce the time and CO2 absorption rate, the present method focused a development of a pressurized loop reactor. At first step, a stainless steel loop reactor with ejector was tested at normal pressure. Then, the CO2 capture has been studied at different pressure in the form of carbonation with Na2SO4 and NH3 solution. The reaction time was monitored at each process.

Yet it is increasingly difficult and costly to meet these goals by ever tighter regulations on tailpipe emissions of internal combustion engine cars. Moreover, concerns about climate change may lead to substantial constraints on emissions of greenhouse gases. It is wholly impractical to capture from tailpipes the principal greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, which is created when hydrocarbon fuel is burned in an internal combustion engine car. But the fuel cell, an energy conversion device that is a candidate to replace the internal combustion engine in cars, and hydrogen, the energy carrier that will ultimately replace hydrocarbon fuel in fuel cell vehicles, can effectively address both of these seemingly intractable challenges. Together, they can provide the next generation of automotive propulsion cleanly and with low life-cycle emissions of greenhouse gases - and perhaps at competitive cost. Fuel Cell Technology Fuel cells convert fuel energy directly into electricity without first burning the fuel to produce heat. All practical fuel cells are fueled by hydrogen. The fuel delivered to a fuel cell is either hydrogen or an energy carrier such as gasoline or methanol that is converted at the point of use into a hydrogen-rich gas that the fuel cell can use. In some respects the fuel cell is similar to an internal combustion engine and in other respects it is like a storage battery. The internal combustion engine takes in reactants from outside the engine - fuel from the fuel tank and air from the atmosphere - and combines them in combustion. The resulting hot, high-pressure, combustion-product gases push pistons that turn the engine crankshaft. Batteries, by contrast, store their reactants within the battery enclosure where they are converted directly into electricity without combustion, but the supply of reactants is limited by the restricted storage capacity of the battery enclosure. The fuel cell combines the best features of both. Like the battery, it produces electricity directly from the reactants - the fuel and oxidizer - but like the internal combustion engine, it converts the energy stored in a separate fuel tank and is able to continue producing electricity as long as sufficient oxidizer and fuel are supplied to it. The main features of the fuel cell system are a fuel supply, an oxidant - typically oxygen from the air - and two electrodes with an ionically conducting but electronically insulating electrolyte sandwiched between them. The electrodes are connected through a load, such as an electric motor, by an external circuit. At the anode, fuel molecules give up electrons to the external circuit and thereby become hydrogen ions; at the cathode, oxygen ions are formed by oxygen molecules from the air plus electrons from the external circuit. The buildup of electrons at the anode compared to the cathode creates a voltage that drives current through the external load. The electrical circuit is completed by the flow of ions through the electrolyte. The net effect of the reactions at the electrodes is that fuel and oxidant combine to form water and, in some types of fuel cells, carbon dioxide also. Fuel Cells Rediscovered Fuel cells were discovered more than a century and a half ago by British lawyer and judge Sir William Grove. While experimenting with electrolysis - using electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen - Grove reasoned that the reverse process should also work: that hydrogen and oxygen should combine in such a way as to generate electricity. His reasoning proved correct, and he demonstrated the first fuel cell in 1839. Little research was done on fuel cells for nearly a century. In the 1960s, however, the fuel cell was rediscovered by scientists working in the aerospace industry. \u2026", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "8b4f22501763ebef82ea9a35a959789b77ff7b62", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2979329245", "PubMedCentral": "6785529", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-019-12469-y", "CorpusId": 203929065, "PubMed": "31597920"}, "title": "Reply to \u2018Bias in energy system models with uniform cost of capital assumption\u2019", "abstract": "The commentary \u2018Bias in energy system models with uniform cost of capital assumption\u20191 highlights the impact of the Cost of Capital (CoC) on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), and questions the choice of a uniform weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for all regions of the world. Since it is well known that CoC has significant impact on LCOE, having an accurate assumption is important for energy systems modeling. The commentary raises the relevant point that a uniform assumption could result in both underestimation and overestimation of the cost of renewable energy in different regions of the world. However, we consider it the best choice available for the transition period 2015 to 2050, as it was implemented in our study2. In addition, it is consistent with values published in leading scientific journals and international reports. To this end, we offer further explanation of the assumption used and discuss how modeling can be improved. The most relevant aspect of energy system scenario development is ignored in the commentary: modeling needs more accurate methods to project WACC/ CoC for future periods up to 2050 and 2100 for all countries globally. First, the commentary by Egli et al. would be applicable to any scientific publication or major international report in the field of energy system modeling. Currently, all major global energy system studies use uniform WACC assumptions, or quasi-uniform assumptions, as in the latest reports of the International Renewable Energy Association (IRENA). Our assumptions are in line with major scenarios: the International Energy Agency (IEA) uses 7% WACC and IRENA uses values of 7.5\u201310% in their latest reports. And the same WACC is uniform for all years in their scenarios. We use a WACC of 7%. Further, leading research teams in the world examining high shares of renewable energy for the global energy system analysis, such as Jacobson et al.3, Teske et al./German Aerospace Center4, DIW5, VTT6, and our team2, use similar uniform WACC assumptions. Second, the commentary by Egli et al. shows that a challenge remains for the field of energy system analysis. The question of how to project WACC to 2050 and beyond remains unanswered in a satisfactory manner. Likewise, it must be acknowledged that regional differences of the future are difficult to predict and may not accurately be seen through a modern lens. There are many unknown factors of the future that could influence CoC in different regions. The same holds true for Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), which are the basis of IPCC reports, as recently summarized for that specific community by Krey et al.7 for capital expenditures. This publication does not comment on variable WACC but assumes a uniform discount rate of 5%. The IAM scenarios are also heavily dependent on the choice of WACC assumptions due to typically wide use of nuclear energy and fossil carbon capture and storage technologies, which require substantial capital. Third, while CoC values are very uncertain, current values for countries shown in the commentary are the result of an estimation method based on 10-year average German CoC values for PV projects and current Moody\u2019s sovereign ratings8 and these values should be used for 2050 calculations. This is a questionable method of projecting future CoC and does nothing to improve upon the dominant method of using uniform values. A uniformly acceptable and better method for long-term WACC estimation for countries does not exist, which is not adequately reflected in the commentary, nor was a better method offered. Analysis of ratings history indicates that many countries have shown significant changes in risk levels in the past decades. South Korea as an example is not unique as many Eastern European countries show substantial risk reductions. At the same time, the countries with the highest CoC, as shown in the commentary, are unstable countries experiencing civil unrest. However, it would be strange to discuss a transition towards 100% RE in these countries while considering that current civil disorders continue until 2050 or 2100. So, it would be inaccurate to use a current CoC value for the long term. Nevertheless, WACC has the highest impact on capital intensive technologies, like renewable energy generation and storage technologies, while conventional power generation is not that strongly affected. This makes it most vital to have realistic WACC assumptions in the steps leading towards the end of a transition, closer to the year 2050, when the share of RE in the energy system becomes dominant. In essence, our WACC assumption is for the year 2050, and then this value is also used for previous years.

As one of the largest emitters of carbon dioxide, with 103.57 million tons of CO2 emissions every year, China should put more cocentration on carbon dioxide emissions (Lu, 2021). Carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technology is currently considered to be the most promising technology for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Studies by international organizations such as IPCC, IEA, GCCSI, and others show that CCUS technology is indispensable to achieve the targets for greenhouse gas emission reduction (Yu, 2020). CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technology can not only drastically reduce the concentration of CO2 but also inject captured CO2 into special underground geological structures to achieve the purpose of permanent storage of CO2. The geological structures that are used to store CO2 include oil and gas reservoirs under development or abandoned, deep brine layers, and oil reservoirs without exploitation value (Wang et al., 2021). CO2 injection into oil and gas reservoirs can not only achieve CO2 storage but also increase oil and gas recovery (Duan et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018), which is currently the main form of CO2 storage and has good economic benefits. In 2007, China designed the first domestic CO2 storage project in the Jilin oil field and the Caoshe Oilfield of East China Branch of Sinopec and achieved industrialization of the CCUS\u2013enhancement oil recovery (EOR) technology. The annual CO2 storage amounted to 350,000 t. In 2012, the Yanchang Oil Company completed a 50,000 t/a CO2 capture and utilization project. The project used CO2 that was produced by the coal chemical industry, and purified and pressurized liquefied by low temperature methanol washing technology, which was then injected into the oil field permanently. The viscosity of the crude oil was reduced, the recovery rate of the crude oil was increased, and then the permanent storage of CO2 realized. In 2015, the CCUS project of refinery tail gas in Sinopec Zhongyuan oil field was completed, and the project was close to abandoned oil fields. The recovery rate of the oil field was increased by 15% by CO2 flooding. At present, millions of tons of CO2 has been stored underground (Zhang X et al., 2021; Li, 2018) (Figure 1) reflects the mechanism of CO2 storage and is intended to provide the reader with a better understanding of the storage process. Increasing the oil recovery rate by CO2 flooding is the most economical and effective means to achieve greenhouse gas emission reduction and deal with world environmental problems at this stage. At present, some oil reservoirs in China have carried out field tests of CO2 flooding and achieved preliminary success.

Over the past decades, significant effort has been targeted at developing and demonstrating at large-scale CO2 capture from power and industrial sources [2]. To accelerate deployment, further efforts are taking place to reduce energy penalties and costs of such a process, as well as scale-up promising solutions. However, one of the key hurdles for implementation remains the destination of these huge CO2 streams. While CO2 storage has been shown to be, by far, the main option to ensure permanent sequestration of the amount of CO2 to be captured [3], integrating CO2 capture and storage can be challenging, especially in the near term, due to the distances between sources and sinks, the time required to develop such geological sinks, scale mismatches, etc. While it is expected to play a smaller role than CO2 storage, CO2 utilization remains an interesting sink for captured CO2 as it creates opportunities for new revenue streams. Furthermore, CO2 utilization can also be considered for small capture flowrates which make it an interesting solution in the case of early deployment. There are many potential routes to convert CO2 into useful and, hopefully, more sustainable chemicals and fuels. For example, converting CO2 into polyols could enable the production of more sustainable elastomers, fibers, flexible foam, adhesives, sealants, inks, paints, and coatings. Another route that can be considered is the conversion of CO2 in valuable energy carriers such as methane, methanol, etc., which could be an attractive CCU solution while simultaneously addressing global warming and storing of hydrogen energy or renewable energy in commonly used dense energy carriers [4\u20136]. However, for all the routes and targeted products, it is important to ensure that CCU pathways deliver the three following aspects: 1) sustainable cradle-tograve solutions 2) economically viable solutions 3) scalable solutions.

CO2 is the second-most important one and that is why reduction of CO2 emissions is a vital area of research. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a major strategy that can be used to reduce GHGs emission. CCS divides into three methods: pre-combustion capture, oxy-fuel process, and post-combustion capture. Among them, post-combustion capture is the most important one because it offers flexibility and it can be easily added to the operational units. For CO2 capture, various technologies are used which include: absorption, adsorption, cryogenic distillation, and membrane separation. Our research focuses on one of the technologies for post-combustion capture, which is membrane separation. In this research, we fabricated four samples of polymeric membranes with different proportions of the components and then tested them for thermal stability, tensile strength, selectivity and permeability. The membrane can be modified by trying different mixtures of the forming polymers with different percentages.

In order to broaden the usage of geological storage as a safe and reliable climate change mitigation option, it is vital to understand CO2 behaviour after its injection within a storage reservoir, including its migration through overlying sediments, as well as its biogeochemical and ecological impacts in the event of leakage at the seafloor. To address these issues, the first controlled CO2 release experiment, entitled 'Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage (QICS)', took place in Ardmucknish Bay, Oban, in May-July 2012. This experiment involved the injection of CO2 of known flux under shallow unconsolidated marine sediments over 36 days and repeated monitoring using geophysical and geochemical techniques. High resolution seismic reflection data (chirp and boomer), covering both pre-release and release stages, allows the detection of various CO2-related anomalies including seismic chimneys, enhanced reflectors within the sediment overburden and bubbles into the overlying water column. CO2 migration pattern is predominantly controlled by the stratigraphy in the early stages of the experiment. However, the increasing flow rate becomes the dominant factor determining CO2 migration, towards the end of the experiment.

To reduce CO2-emissions offshore, electrification of the Norwegian continental shelf by long power cables from renewable onshore power production has been on the political agenda since the mid nineties, however, due to cost, only a few facilities are currently supplied by onshore power. By replacing the gas turbines with a highly effective hybrid fuel cell system, CMR Prototech has suggested an alternative solution that combined with carbon capture and storage may potentially produce clean and highly efficient offshore power (CHEOP). To replace today\u2019s offshore gas turbines, a topside concept capable of delivering 32 MW of electrical power is required. In that context, CMR Prototech has developed a proposed P&ID of a scaled-down CHEOP process that delivers 3.2 MW of electrical power at an electrical efficiency of 60% without carbon capture. In this work, a flow-sheet model of CMR Prototech\u2019s suggested CHEOP process with carbon capture was simulated in Aspen HYSYS to investigate its potential to produce clean and highly efficient power offshore. However, to be able to implement the proposed process in HYSYS, the membrane reactor of the CHEOP process was replaced by an already existing process route for syngas production and hydrogen separation as there is no specific unit operations that models the behaviour of membrane reactors in Aspen HYSYS, and to model one is outside the scope of this thesis. Hence, based on the nominal operating conditions of CMR Prototech\u2019s proposed CHEOP process and a literature review of hydrogen production technologies, an equilibrium-based flow-sheet model of the CHEOP process with carbon capture was developed in Aspen HYSYS to investigate its potential performance in this work.

In other words, it strives to develop a clean coal technology that simultaneously generates electric power, stores part of coal\u2019s energy in clean hydrogen fuel, and produces nearly capture-ready CO2. If successful and widely adopted, this technology promises to double the efficiency of coal power generation, resulting in a significant reduction in global CO2 emissions thereby ensuring continued use of our cheapest and most abundant fuel \u2013 coal \u2013 in an environmentally friendly manner. The steam-carbon fuel cell concept introduced in this project allows spontaneous conversion of coal into an environmentally benign fuel, hydrogen. This novel concept not only achieves steam gasification of coal while keeping hydrogen and carbon dioxide product streams unmixed and physically separated, but more importantly, drives the otherwise thermodynamically uphill reaction for steam dissociation energetically downhill. In this process scheme, no nitrogen enters the reaction stream so the anode product gases contain primarily CO2 and unreacted CO, while the cathode gas stream contains primarily H2 and unreacted steam. In other words, the steam-carbon fuel cell concept enables simultaneous and spontaneous production of carbon-free hydrogen and electricity from coal (or biomass) and produces a highly concentrated CO2 product stream that can easily be captured. Work in our laboratory over the past year has focused in building the research team and physical facilities necessary for assembly and testing of various fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) of different catalysts compositions, particularly the testing of sulfur tolerant anode materials. As sulfur is a major coal contaminant and a barrier to advance this technology, this project also aims to develop sorbent materials for capture and removal of coal contaminants, mainly sulfur so screening is essential to the success of the project. Furthermore, work has begun on the synthesis of prospective catalysts that are reported to show good sulfur tolerance under conditions relevant to carbon fuel cells.

We estimate Indonesia\u2019s total peat carbon store to be within 13.6\u00a0GtC (the low MoA map estimate) and 40.5\u00a0GtC (the high WI map estimate) with a best estimate of 28.1 GtC: the midpoint of medium carbon stock estimates derived from WI (30.8\u00a0GtC) and MoA (25.3\u00a0GtC) maps. This estimate is about half of previous assessments which used an assumed average value of peat thickness for all Indonesian peatlands, and revises the current global tropical peat carbon pool to 75\u00a0GtC. Yet, these results do not diminish the significance of Indonesia\u2019s peatlands, which store an estimated 30% more carbon than the biomass of all Indonesian forests. The largest discrepancy between maps is for the Papua province, which accounts for 62\u201371% of the overall differences in peat area, volume and carbon storage. According to the MoA map, 80% of Indonesian peatlands are\u00a0<300\u00a0cm thick and thus vulnerable to conversion outside of protected areas according to environmental regulations. The carbon contained in these shallower peatlands is conservatively estimated to be 10.6 GtC, equivalent to 42% of Indonesia\u2019s total peat carbon and about 12\u00a0years of global emissions from land use change at current rates.ConclusionsConsidering the high uncertainties in peatland extent, volume and carbon storage revealed in this assessment of current maps, a systematic revision of Indonesia\u2019s peat maps to produce a single geospatial reference that is universally accepted would improve national peat carbon storage estimates and greatly benefit carbon cycle research, land use management and spatial planning.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "73679bf1ef33d6d8bcce09390e9a49278c41bb8f", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1029/2021GB007186", "CorpusId": 247606150}, "title": "Mechanisms Controlling Carbon Sinks in Semi\u2010Arid Mountain Ecosystems", "abstract": "Feedbacks between the intertwined water and carbon cycles in semi\u2010arid mountain ecosystems can introduce large uncertainties into projections of carbon storage.

We applied a dynamic vegetation\u2010ecosystem model (Lund\u2010Potsdam\u2010Jena General Ecosystem Simulator) to simulate water\u2010carbon interactions in the 104,512 km2 Mediterranean\u2010climate ecosystems of California's Sierra Nevada for 1950\u20132099. Our 48 scenarios include a combination of carbon dioxide (CO2) increase, air temperature change, and varying plant rooting depths. We found that with warming (+2 and +5\u00b0C), water limitations on growth and enhanced soil respiration reduce carbon storage; however, CO2 fertilization and associated enhanced water\u2010use efficiency offset this loss. Using the 4 km model resolution to capture steep mountain precipitation gradients, plus accounting for the several meters of actual root\u2010accessible water storage in the region, were also important. With warming accompanied by CO2 fertilization our projections show that the Sierra Nevada sequestering at least 200 Tg (2 kg m\u22122) carbon, versus carbon loss with warming alone. The increase reflects coniferous forests growing at high elevations, and some increase in broadleaved forests at low\u2010to\u2010intermediate elevations.

Offshore transport and storage costs by comparison are found to be roughly twice as expensive but t may still be attractive because of easier access to property rights for sub-seafloor storage as well as a simpler regulatory system, and possibly lower MMV requirements, at least in the deep-ocean where pressures and temperatures would keep the CO{sub 2} negatively buoyant.

To reach these targets, a large amount of research and development (R&D) has been conducted on three major categories of materials for CO2 capture: sorbents (e.g. metal organic frameworks, zeolites, metal oxides-based adsorbents), solvents (e.g. aqueous piperazine, ionic liquids, chilled ammonia), membranes (e.g. facilitated transport membranes, mixed matrix membranes). The major objectives of this study are to review state-of-the-art technologies using novel sorbents, solvents, and membranes for CO2 capture; comparatively examine their recent material properties, process engineering, and engineering-economics with special attention to post-combustion CO2 capture applications; and further identify urgent R&D needs for advanced capture technologies in meeting the NETL\u2019s cost targets. Specific research missions for each category are illustrated as follows: \u2022 Material Properties. For sorbents and solvents, the major properties of interest will include adsorption or absorption capability, specific heat capacity, heat of adsorption or absorption, and viscosity, while the major properties of interest for membranes will include permeability and selectivity. For each category, this study will compare major properties among various materials and examine the variability in material properties by pressure and temperature, as well as the effects of water vapor and minor air pollutants on CO2 adsorption or absorption capacity or CO2 permeability. \u2022 Process Engineering. This study will identify most feasible process configurations and typical designs of operating pressure and temperature. The major process performance parameters of interest will include the thermal and electric power requirements and overall energy penalty for CO2 capture, cooling duty, and material degradation. This study will also examine the variability in major performance parameters by CO2 separation targets on recovery rate and product purity. \u2022 Engineering-Economics. This study will compare the overall costs of CO2 captured and avoided plus the added cost of electricity generation for CO2 capture for post-combustion applications. This study will also examine the variability in major cost metrics by CO2 separation targets. Three sets of data will be collected and assembled based on peer-reviewed publications and patent databases. For each category, this study will highlight advantages, disadvantages, challenges, and potential solutions to improve the viability. Advanced capture process options in the three categories will be compared in terms of the overall energy penalty and the cost of CO2 captured or avoided to identify \u201cstep-out\u201d capture technologies, including innovative hybrid designs that can integrate multiple materials or technologies into a single system and then utilize their individual strengths to lower energy and cost penalties. Based on the review results, this study will further determine the material property targets and process performance requirements for the most promising technologies in meeting the NETL\u2019s cost targets for CO2 capture. To achieve this objective, an empirical model that relates major material properties, process performance parameters and cost factors to the overall capture cost will be developed for the selected capture technologies based on the assembled data. The Integrated Environmental Control Model (IECM), a power plant modeling tool developed by Carnegie Mellon University, has been enhanced significantly by incorporating a variety of CO2 capture technologies into the common framework, such as membranes, ionic liquids, and solid sorbents. Both the empirical model and IECM will be employed jointly for a \u201creverseengineering\u201d to identify \u201cideal\u201d materials properties, process performance and material prices necessary to achieve the capture cost targets. The results of this analysis can guide the direction of R&D programs for advancing CO2 capture technologies.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "b71517cd2c36dc468ed36ef7a69dc08d52583eb9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2757425696", "CorpusId": 134626406}, "title": "Toward a Law of the Underground: Assessing the Physical and Perceptual Risks of Geologic Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "of a dissertation at the University of Miami. Dissertation supervised by Professor Kenneth Broad and Professor Peter Swart. No. of pages in text. (237) Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies have both potential economic benefits and potential climate change mitigation impacts. However, CCS is not without physical and perceptual risks. In this dissertation, I followed two parallel research tracks regarding potential leakage of carbon dioxide out of CCS storage reservoirs. I completed three technical projects using data from the global-to-local level. First, I used Bayesian modeling to understand the potential for a surface release of carbon dioxide. These models allowed me to conclude that discrete, large-volume events are unlikely but not impossible events and draw similar risk conclusions as research from other disciplines. Second, I conducted a review to characterize a University of Miami research study site in southeast Texas. This review allowed me to use commercially available modeling software to understand potential subsurface behavior at a known CCS site. This project gave our research team an initial understanding of the study site geochemistry and geomechanics. Third, I used location-specific data to assess if current monitoring, measurement, and verification technologies have the ability to detect changes in surface carbon dioxide measurements at a continuously monitored site. This project allowed me to analyze ten months of measurement data for potential leak events and understand the value of monitoring and verification technologies for event detection and risk mitigation. In parallel to these technical projects, I engaged in a series of qualitative research projects. In one project, I was able to investigate the general perception of CCS risks in the United States and analyze if opinions and knowledge of hydraulic fracturing impacted the general perception of CCS. In a second project, a literature review, I synthesized the current state of CCS knowledge and deployment in the United States. In my last project, I provided commentary on emerging concepts in the CCS space. Taken together, the six projects that comprised this dissertation provided me an understanding of the implementation practices, CCS site technologies, physical risks, and perceptual risks that influence the formation and maintenance of a law of the underground.

Achieving Net Zero CO2 requires understanding where energy is produced and consumed, the magnitude of CO2 generation, and the Carbon Cycle. It is unreasonable to assume that fossil fuel can be completely replaced, and thus, atmospheric CO2 will continue to accumulate. Many prior proposed solutions focus on reducing future CO2 emissions from continued use of fossil fuels. Examination of these technologies exposes their limitations and shows that none offer a complete solution. Direct Capture technologies are needed to reduce CO2 already in the air. However, some of those already proposed would lead to a very high cost of Carbon Capture, Use, and Storage (CCUS). Biofuels can help achieve reduction goals. However, two of the six carbons in sugar fermented to bioethanol produce CO2 per the stoichiometry of the reaction. Four carbons go to ethanol, which go back to the atmosphere upon burning in an engine. Thus, without CCUS, which most current bioethanol plants do not practice, bioethanol would at best be sustainable. The only way to permanently remove CO2 already in the atmosphere is to break the Carbon Cycle by growing biomass from atmospheric CO2 and permanently sequestering that biomass carbon. Permanent sequestration can be achieved in landfills modified to discourage biomass decomposition to CO2 and methane. Sequestration of biomass carbon is proposed as a simple and natural means of Direct Capture. Tree leaves are proposed as a good source of biomass for this purpose. Left unsequestered, leaves decompose with a short Carbon Cycle time constant releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere. Leaves represent a substantial fraction of the total biomass generated by a tree when integrated over a tree\u2019s lifetime. High yield crops, such as switchgrass would also be a good source of biomass. The cost for growing switchgrass and sequestering it in a landfill is estimated to be on the order of $120/mt CO2 for a conservative yield of 3.5 tons/acre and may be reduced to as low as $88/mt CO2 if the development of high yield switchgrass is successful. This compares to an estimated cost of CCUS from the Steam Reforming of Methane to produce hydrogen of about $190/mt. Thus, sequestration of biomass is shown to be a natural, carbon efficient, and low-cost method of Direct Capture.", "year": 2021}]}
