PCC plant operators can modify capture plant process variables to adjust the CO2 capture level to a value which is optimal for current fuel cost, electricity selling price and CO2 emissions costs, increasing short-term profitability. Additionally, variation of the level of steam extraction from the generation plant can allow the capture facility to provide additional operating flexibility for coal-fired power stations which are comparatively slow to change output. A pilot-scale test campaign investigates the response of plant operating parameters to dynamic scenarios which are designed to be representative of pulverised coal plant operation. Online sensors continuously monitor changes in rich and lean solvent CO2 loading (30%wt monoethanolamine). Solvent loading is likely to be a critical control variable for the optimisation of flexible PCC operation, and since economic and operational boundaries can change on timescales 30min or shorter, the development of methods for rapid, continuous online solvent analysis is key. Seven dynamic datasets are produced and insights about plant response times and hydrodynamics are provided. These include power output maximisation, frequency response, power output ramping and a comparison between two plant start-up strategies. In the final dynamic operating scenario, control of CO2 capture efficiency for a simple reboiler steam decoupling and reintroduction event is demonstrated using only knowledge of plant hydrodynamics and continuous measurement of solvent lean loading. Hot water flow to the reboiler is reduced to drop the capture efficiency. The \u201ctarget\u201d value for the minimum capture efficiency in the scenario was set at 30%, but a minimum CO2 capture efficiency of 26.4% was achieved. While there remains scope for improvement this represents a significant practical step towards the control of capture plant using online solvent concentration and CO2 measurements, and the next steps for its further development are discussed.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "87f6aa258fbe127ef7bf25ac9212033f053d8e9a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2971712453", "DOI": "10.5151/iv-enei-2019-5.3-072", "CorpusId": 202917720}, "title": "TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION TOWARDS CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION", "abstract": "This paper aims to present and analyze the production of green technological knowledge for the mitigation of climate change from countries and companies \u201ccarbon majors\u201d.

Carbon dioxide from several gas fields is removed from the gas production stream in a central gas processing facility and then the CO2 is compressed, transported and stored underground in the 1.9km deep Carboniferous sandstone unit at the Krechba field. Injection commenced in 2004 and since then over 3.8Mt of CO2 has been stored in the subsurface. The storage performance has been monitored using a unique and diverse portfolio of geophysical and geochemical methods, including time-lapse seismic, micro-seismic, wellhead sampling using CO2 gas tracers, down-hole logging and core analysis, surface gas monitoring, groundwater aquifer monitoring and satellite InSAR data. Routines and procedures for collecting and interpreting these data have been developed, and valuable insights into appropriate Monitoring, Modelling and Verification (MMV) approaches for CO2 storage have been gained. We summarize the key elements of the project life-cycle and identify the key lessons learned from this demonstration project that can be applied to other major CCS projects, notably: The need for detailed geological and geomechanical characterization of the reservoir and overburden; The importance of regular risk assessments based on the integration of multiple different datasets; The importance of flexibility in the design and operation of the capture, compression, and injection system. The In Salah project thus provides an important case study for knowledge transfer to other major CCS projects in the planning and execution phases. \u00a9 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The enormous amounts of methane hydrate which have been found in the world\u2019s oceans and Polar Regions, is also a vital importance. Hence, it is obvious that studying the thermodynamics and the crystallization mechanisms of clathrate hydrates is really inevitable to investigate gas hydrate phenomena. However gas hydrates from hydrocarbon gas mixtures have been widely studied, but few data involving propane and butane are available. Moreover, these studies do not provide the hydrate volume and water consumption. The determination of the gas composition in hydrate phase, as well as its volume, is also technical challenges and few data is available in the literature. During the last decade, our \u201cGasHyDyn\u201d team has measured equilibrium data for many gas mixtures, and this document adds new data involving propane. Based on a new approach in our laboratory, the molar composition of each phase (Gas, liquid and hydrate phases) as well as hydrate volume and water conversion has been also investigated.

To evaluate the importance of kinetic effects on hydrate formation, a thermodynamic model, implementing classic van der Waals and Platteuw model, were used. The results show that from the same initial conditions, the final pressure and water conversion are slightly different for two different crystallization processes. Furthermore, it was noticed that the enclathration of the heavier molecule (here propane) is more important at slow than quick crystallization rate and composition of propane in hydrate phase at final state in slow crystallization is more than quick crystallization. The Volume of hydrate and also water conversion in quick crystallization process is larger than slow crystallization rate. Moreover, the thermodynamic simulation of hydrate phase has a better accordance with the results of slow crystallization rate.

Es ist ihr gelungen, zumindest in Europa im Bewusstsein der Menschen die Emissionen von Klimagasen als groste Gefahr fur das Wohlergehen kunftiger Generationen zu verankern. Die Wahrnehmung anderer Gefahren der fortschreitenden Umweltschadigung hat in der Offentlichkeit und der Politik allerdings abgenommen, Klimaschutz steht bei vielen synonym fur Umweltschutz. Ferner hat es die Umweltpolitik geschafft, in der Politik in Europa die Akzeptanz okonomischer Instrumente und hier insbesondere der handelbaren Emissionsrechte so weit durchzusetzen, dass die Grundstoffindustrien in Bezug auf die CO2-Emissionen im Rahmen des ETS einem solchen System unterliegen, und dass dieses System voraussichtlich auf weitere Bereiche der Wirtschaft ausgebaut werden wird. Das Klimaproblem erscheint als losbar, indem man mit dem \u201eGlobal Deal\u201c (Edenhofer 2008) ein weltweites System Handelbarer Emissionsrechte einfuhrt. Allerdings ist man weder auf der Konferenz von Bali 2007 noch auf der von Posen 2008 diesem Ziel bislang naher gekommen. Auf der anderen Seite stellen wir fest, dass die Suche nach Strategien zur Vermeidung von CO2-Emissionen Verhaltensweisen generiert, die neue Probleme schaffen und alte Probleme als weniger dringlich erscheinen lassen. Zum letzteren gehort die wieder erstarkende Akzeptanz der Nutzung der Kernenergie, zum ersten Punkt die Gewinnung von Kraftstoffen aus Pflanzen. Biodiesel aus Raps und Ethanol fur Ottomotoren werden zunehmend als erneuerbare Energietrager eingesetzt. Damit gehen aber der Landwirtschaft Flachen zur Erzeugung von Nahrungsmitteln verloren und die Preise fur Nahrungsmittel stehen im Verbund mit den Preisen der Kraftstoffe aus fossilen Energietragern, was gerade fur die armsten Menschen in den Entwicklungslandern schwere Konsequenzen hat. Ein anderes Beispiel sind die Hybridfahrzeuge, die durch die Zuschaltung oder den zeitweisen Betrieb eines Elektromotors zum Verbrennungsmotor wohl die mit der Transportleistung der Fahrzeuge verbundenen CO2-Emissionen mindern. Diese Hybridfahrzeuge weisen aber dennoch eine verheerende Okobilanz auf, weil zusatzlich der Elektromotor und die Batterie erzeugt und spater entsorgt werden mussen. Im Zentrum der Logik der CO2-Emissionsvermeidungsstrategie liegt auch die Entwicklung der so genannten CCSTechnologie (Carbon Capture and Storage): Bei der Stromerzeugung durch Kohleverbrennung wird durch zusatzlichen Energieeinsatz das CO2 abgeschieden und in unterirdische naturliche Lagerstatten verbracht, wo es dann hoffentlich auch verbleibt. Letzteres ist noch nicht sicher. Kommt dieses Verfahren etwa ab 2020 zum Einsatz, dann konnen zwar die CO2-Emissionen bei der Stromerzeugung gemindert werden, aber der Rohstoffverbrauch wird weiter beschleunigt. Die Liste der Beispiele ist lang, die zeigen, dass die Umweltpolitik gegenwartig erhebliche Probleme hat, die immer wieder den gesamten Ansatz in Frage stellen. Wenn eine Therapie so heftige Nebenwirkungen hat, dann ist die Frage erlaubt, ob der theoretische Ansatz, der dieser Politik zu Grunde liegt, noch tragt. Die heute herrschende neoklassische Umweltokonomik hat die Reduktion der Emission von Rest- und Schadstoffen zum Ziel. Ihr Forschungsansatz ist dabei der der mikrookonomischen Partialanalyse.

A total of 77 tracks and 308 plots were selected and all trees in each plot were measured to estimate the biomass following allometric equations. There were planted stand of Acacia auriculiformis, Dipterocarpus turbinatus, Gmelina arborea, Lagerstroemia speciosa, Swietenia macrophylla and Tectona grandis. Biomass and carbon stocks of these corresponding tree species were 35.03, 73.86, 23.52, 30.16, 44.49, and 42.67 mg/ha. The highest carbon stock per tree was in D. turbinatus (372.19 kg C/tree), followed by S. macrophylla (226.49 kg C/tree), T. grandis (215.06 kg C/tree), A. auriculiformis (176.56 kg C/tree), L. speciosa (151.19 kg C/tree) and G. arborea (118.54 kg C/tree), respectively. The findings of the study will be helpful for the estimation of carbon stocks in the forests of Bangladesh. Introduction Forests play an important role in regional and global carbon cycles. They can be both sources and sinks of carbon depending on management, exploitation and disturbances. When they are managed well they can sequester or conserve significant quantities of carbon on the land (Sharma et al. 2011). Thus, there is a need to accurately determine the amount of carbon stored in different forest ecosystems (Nizami 2010). Plants in the forests capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in the form of fixed biomass. Among them, trees play a major role in forest carbon storage and act as the principal sink of carbon (Karthick and Pragasan 2014) because they are long lived, and their wood is also long lasting. However, deforestation and other degradation processes can lead to conversion of these sinks into sources of carbon dioxide. For several decades, the forests of Bangladesh have suffered severely from human interferences including over-cropping, burning, hill cutting, habitat destruction, indiscriminate and illegal logging, etc. It was reported that there had been rapid forest deterioration and deforestation in most parts of the tropics over the last decade, with South-East Asia incurring the highest loss (Hansen et al. 2013). Therefore, degradation of forest at the scale that occurred in Kaptai National Park and its surrounding areas has certainly caused attrition of tree biomass and carbon stocks. In this context the present work was carried out to determine the present stocks of tree biomass and carbon of different dominant forest tree species in the Kaptai National Park, Rangamati, situated in the south-eastern region of Bangladesh. Materials and Methods The Kaptai National Park was established in 1999 in Rangamati Hill Tracts District and lies between 22\u00b027 \u0301 to 22\u00b032 \u0301 N latitudes and 92\u00b030 \u0301 to 92\u00b016 \u0301 E longitudes.

The production and supply of food is responsible for global environmental impacts and a transition to a sustainable food system is required. Seafood plays a key role in the food system, as a vital source of protein and essential nutrients, yet fisheries and aquaculture are often left out of discussions on food and nutrition security. The broader impacts of seafood as part of the food system are rarely considered through current sustainability assessments. The result is that the environmental impacts generated from the supply and consumption of seafood products are not well understood. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a practical and credible tool for assessing the environmental footprints of food products and production methods. LCAs of seafood have increased substantially over the past decade, encompassing a range of species, production methods, and geographic locations. Nevertheless, the field lags behind LCA of terrestrial systems in terms of both empirical coverage and methods. \nThis thesis expands the literature on seafood LCAs, using Australian seafood case studies. The aim is to improve the understanding of the environmental impacts of seafood production and consumption as a part of the broader food system, and to identify opportunities to advance seafood sustainability concepts and practice. The thesis consists of five papers which are linked through the LCA framework, and have a strong emphasis on seafood as part of a sustainable food system, and on the nexus between LCA and contemporary fisheries management principles and practices. In the first paper LCA is used to measure the environmental performance of the white banana prawn (Fenneropenaeus merguiensis) from the Australian Northern Prawn Fishery across its supply chain. Management of this fishery has been promoted as a sustainable model for other countries to emulate, although broader environmental impacts, such as those relating to energy and water use or greenhouse gas emissions are not currently monitored. Fishing operations were the main source of impacts, while processing and storage were key contributors to ecotoxicity, and transport made a negligible contribution to any impact category. This research highlighted the scope to develop the application of LCA in wild capture fisheries in terms of complementing existing fisheries management, and through the development of fishery-specific indicators to improve the efficacy of seafood LCAs. \nThere is a need for information to better understand the relationship between seafood LCAs and fisheries management. In the second paper LCA was used to measure the environmental footprint of the supply of Tasmanian southern rock lobster, Jasus edwardsii (TSRL) under different management scenarios. The environmental footprint of the TSRL in the scenarios modelled was responsive to marine resource management decisions made inside and outside the fishery. Targeting maximum economic yield rather than maximum sustainable yield decreased the carbon footprint by 80%. Limiting access to the fishery by increasing the coverage of marine protected areas increased the fishery\u2019s carbon footprint by 23%. Better understanding of the environmental impacts resulting from management changes will be vital in a future of increased carbon emission reporting and regulation. The application of LCA to marine resource decision-making can help ensure decisions are not made in isolation of broader environmental impacts. \nThe lobster LCA also highlighted that the international airfreight of live lobsters was the major contributor to global warming potential (GWP) and cumulative energy demand (CED). The distance between where food is produced and consumed is increasing, and is often taken as evidence of an unsustainable global food system. Seafood is a highly traded commodity and in the third paper LCA was used to examine the impacts of the movement of products beyond the fishery or farm to better understand the environmental impact of seafood as part of the broader food system. The carbon footprints of the production and distribution of select seafood products that are consumed in Australia were compared to determine differences in the sustainability of imports and their domestically produced counterparts. The distance food is transported was not found to be the main determinant of carbon emissions. Despite the increased distance between production and consumption, carbon footprints of meals from imported seafood can be similar to meals consisting of domestically produced seafood, and sometimes lower, depending on the seafood consumed. In combining LCA with existing seafood sustainability criteria the trade-offs between sustainability targets become more apparent. \nWhile the addition of carbon footprinting to current seafood sustainability assessments broadens their perspective, the carbon footprint should not be taken as a complete measure of product sustainability in LCA. A combination of relevant LCA indicators can provide a more holistic assessment of overall seafood sustainability. However, while LCA is a well-developed and useful tool for assessing carbon emissions and other biophysical impacts, it is lacking in the assessment of fishery specific impacts. Several new methods have been proposed in recent years to account for fishing impacts on ecosystems and biotic resources through LCA. In the fourth paper, a new method is proposed to complement these advances through accounting for impacts of fishing on biodiversity as a measure of naturalness of the seafloor and pelagic habitats. The method has been adapted from its original terrestrial application and incorporates elements of existing seafood certification schemes and marine ecological risk assessment. It is a contribution to the much needed improved application of LCA to wild-capture fisheries. \nIn the final paper, a literature review is conducted to examine how the environmental performance of seafood is integrated and interpreted within the rapidly growing body of literature on sustainable diets. Seafood is examined in terms of its reported comparative performance to agricultural products and in its role in a sustainable food system. Seafood diets typically have lower carbon footprints than meat diets and higher footprints than vegetarian diets. However, many studies do not adequately address seafood and thereby overlook the opportunities and limitations of including seafood as part of a sustainable diet. \nLCA is used in this thesis to assess the environmental impacts of seafood and to expand the concept of sustainability of seafood, however, fisheries, aquaculture and their supply chains remain often neglected, yet critically important, parts of healthy and sustainable food systems. This research brings seafood a step closer to adequate representation in food systems research, although further development of seafood LCAs and better methods for comparing seafood and agricultural production systems are required. More of this type of research is therefore needed to ensure that seafood is included in future food and nutrition security discourse.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "51ad46e6a4caa025415f6171db0196e01fba1e91", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2848923811", "DOI": "10.1016/J.SURFCOAT.2018.07.033", "CorpusId": 104616444}, "title": "Nanostructured porous carbons for electrochemical energy conversion and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "1484d117d8a59ceb1759b83f6f064aa6b194ccef", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3164117674", "DOI": "10.22541/AU.162187141.19715111/V1", "CorpusId": 236342831}, "title": "La nuova generazione di fotobioreattori algali per la cattura della CO2", "abstract": "Ad oggi si sente sempre pi\u00f9 spesso parlare del problema del\nsurriscaldamento globale dovuto ad un sempre maggiore inquinamento\natmosferico da parte delle industrie, agricoltura, automobili ecc.,\ntutto ci\u00f2 sta portando il nostro pianeta a frequenti e pericolosi\ndisastri ambientali.

In the study, various service demands are firstly estimated based on social-economic data and then best technology and energy mixes are obtained using the optimization model to meet the service demand. On the conductance of integrated scenario analysis towards the year 2100 when zero-carbon energy system will be attained, three different scenarios of nuclear power development are taken, i.e., (i)no further introduction of nuclear, (ii) fixed portion and (iii) no limit of nuclear. The results show that, in the end user side, zero-carbon energy scenario can be attained at 2100 with electricity supplies 75% of total energy utilization. And for the electricity supply, three different power generation scenarios are proposed: (Scenario 1) 30% renewable and 70% gas-CCS(Carbon Capture and Storage), (Scenario 2) every one third by nuclear, by renewable and by gas-CCS, and (Scenario 3) 60% nuclear power, 20% renewable and 10% gas-CCS.

Methods proposed in the literature to reduce the number of function evaluations are often designed for pattern level analysis and do not scale easily to full field analysis. These methods are rarely applied to both water and miscible gas floods with carbon storage objectives; reservoir management decision making under geological uncertainty is also relatively underexplored. In this work, several innovations are proposed to efficiently determine the optimal injector location under geological uncertainty. A geomodel ensemble is prepared in order to capture the range of geological uncertainty. In these models, the reservoir is divided into multiple well regions that are delineated through spatial clustering. Streamline simulation results are used to train a meta-learner proxy. A posterior sampling algorithm evaluates injector locations across multiple geological realizations. The proposed methodology was applied to a producing field in Asia. The proxy predicted optimal injector locations for water and CO2 EOR and storage floods within several seconds (94\u201398% R2 scores). Blind tests with geomodels not used in training yielded accuracies greater than 90% (R2 scores). Posterior sampling selected optimal injection locations within minutes compared to hours using numerical simulation.

Africa hosts about 19% of the world\u2019s mangroves, yet relatively few studies have examined the carbon stocks of African mangroves. The available studies report considerable differences among sites and amongst the different pools of carbon stocks. None considered the effects of seaward distance. We present details of AGC and SOC carbon stocks for Lindi in Tanzania, and focus on how these values differ with increasing seaward distance and, how our results compare to those reported elsewhere across Africa. Results AGC ranged between 11 and 55\u00a0Mg C ha \u22121 , but was not significantly affected by seaward distance. SOC for 0\u20131\u00a0m depth ranged from 154 to 484, with a mean of 302\u00a0Mg\u00a0C\u00a0ha \u22121 . SOC was significantly negatively correlated with seaward distance. Mangrove type (estuarine/oceanic), soil erosion, soil depth may explain these differences We note important methodological differences in previous studies on carbon stocks in mangroves in Africa. Conclusion This study indicates that seaward distance has an important effect on SOC stocks in the Lindi region of Tanzania.

The exact evaluation of the CO2 storage capacity can verify the feasibility of storing carbon dioxide and parameter optimization. A reasonable boundary element method to estimating the CO2 storage capacity of depleted shale gas reservoirs considering arbitrarily shaped boundaries is introduced. Firstly, the physical model with fracture networks is built based on the microseismic data. Then, the flow equation including the matrix and fracture can be obtained considering adsorption, and the star-delta transformation is used to deal with interconnected fracture segments.

Many of the largest point sources of carbon dioxide are power plants and industries fuelled by fossil fuels or biomass. There are several technologies for adapting the combustion process to capture carbon dioxide and chemical-looping combustion is one such option. It has the advantage of keeping the fuel and the combustion air apart, thus avoiding energy consuming and costly separation of carbon dioxide and nitrogen. This is achieved by transferring oxygen from the air to the fuel by a cyclic oxidation and reduction of a solid metal oxide. The oxygen-carrier material needs to meet several requirements in order to achieve an efficient combustion process. Manganese oxides have promising properties as oxygen-carrier material and these can be further improved by combining manganese with for example iron, silica and calcium. Chemical-looping combustion is mainly developed as a technology for fluidised-bed combustion, with the oxygen carrier present as bed material in the form of small particles. To perform well in a circulating fluidised bed, the oxygen carrier needs to be mechanically stable as well as have good reactivity with the fuel. The work presented in this thesis examines the performance of manganese combined oxides as oxygen carriers in chemical-looping combustion units and in a conventional circulating fluidised bed. The operation has been carried out in two reactor systems with gaseous fuels and in a large-scale biomass boiler, in which the properties of the materials have been evaluated. It has been shown that full conversion of the fuel can be achieved in chemical-looping combustion with calcium manganites as oxygen carrier. Furthermore, combined oxides of iron-manganese-silica and manganese-silica have been examined. High fuel conversion was achieved with both combined oxide systems, but the mechanical stability of these materials was poor. It was found that the mechanical stability of combined oxides of manganese-silica could be improved by adding titania to the material.

In order to assess the spread of technology worldwide, an analysis of foreign experience in implementing such initiatives is presented, as well as the main promising ways of carbon dioxide utilization and their key features are identified. The economic efficiency of the CO2-based methanol production project (by the example of a commercial project in Iceland) is substantiated. A general vision of the prerequisites and opportunities for the implementation of CC(U)S initiatives in the Arctic regions is presented.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "9f39bbc7bac82fbef5d04628e38eb3627a07a937", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2155580001", "DOI": "10.2489/jswc.67.5.365", "CorpusId": 130338177}, "title": "Carbon storage and nitrous oxide emissions of cropping systems in eastern Washington: A simulation study", "abstract": "Conservation tillage is an agricultural strategy to mitigate atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In eastern Washington, we evaluated the long-term effects of conventional tillage (CT), reduced tillage (RT) and no-tillage (NT) on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions at three dryland and one irrigated location using the cropping systems simulation model CropSyst. Conversion of CT to NT produced the largest relative increase in SOC storage (\u0394SOC, average yearly change relative to CT) in the top 30 cm (11.8 in) of soil where \u0394SOC ranged from 0.29 to 0.53 Mg CO2e ha\u22121 y\u22121 (CO2e is carbon dioxide [CO2] equivalent of SOC; 0.13 to 0.24 tn CO2e ac\u22121 yr\u22121). The \u0394SOC were less with lower annual precipitation, greater fallow frequency, and when changing from CT to RT. Overall, \u0394SOC decreased from the first to the third decade after conversion from CT to NT or RT. Simulations of \u0394SOC for the conversion of CT to NT based on a 0 to 15 cm (0 to 5.9 in) soil depth were greater than the \u0394SOC based on a 0 to 30 cm depth, primarily due to differences among tillage regimes in the depth-distribution of carbon (C) inputs and the resultant SOC distribution with depth. Soil erosion rates under CT in the study region are high, posing deleterious effects on soil quality, productivity, and aquatic systems. However, an analysis that includes deposition, burial, and sedimentation on terrestrial and aquatic systems of eroded SOC indicates that the substantial erosion reduction obtained with RT and NT may result only in minor additional SOC oxidation as compared to CT. Simulated N2O emissions, expressed as CO2 equivalent, were not very different under CT, RT, and NT. However, N2O emissions were sufficiently high to offset gains in SOC from the conversion of CT to RT or NT. Thus, reducing tillage intensity can result in net C storage, but mitigation of GHG is limited unless it is coupled with nitrogen (N) fertilizer management to also reduce N2O emission.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "3279b67b1f3a1a1cb7b052f5ab25c89797ac1921", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 201932920}, "title": "Effect of Pressure on Electrical Conductivity and Formation Factor in Sandstone", "abstract": "Apart from changes due to variations in viscosity of a conducting fluid, electrical conductivity is mostly independent of pressure.

We extended these findings to adults undergoing a prebasic molt (the energetically costly replacement of feathers) and to juveniles. Results indicate not only that the stress response is dramatically reduced at one breeding site, but that the stress response during molt and in juveniles is lower still. In fact, juveniles failed to secrete any corticosterone in response to capture and handling, suggesting a stress hyporesponsive period. We also examined possible mechanisms underlying stress modulation. Corticosterone binding protein capacity does not change, and the stress response is only correlated with the overall condition of the bird (assessed by fat storage) at one site, suggesting that neither can explain the different corticosterone responses. Adrenal insensitivity also does not appear to fully explain reduced maximal output since exogenous ACTH enhanced corticosterone release. Exogenous ACTH, however, cannot stimulate corticosterone to stress-induced levels at the high-response site, implying reduced adrenal capacity. Redpoll pituitaries responded to exogenous corticotrophin-releasing factor and arginine vasotocin, suggesting a mechanism upstream from the pituitary blunts corticosterone release.

Since its formulation in 2014 [2], the SAFT-\u03b3 Mie EoS has been applied for providing an accurate description of the thermodynamic properties and fluid phase equilibria for a broad range of engineering applications.

Additionally, it has been used in the pharmaceutical industry to predict the solvation, solubility, and partition coefficients of active pharmaceutical ingredients (e.g., paracetamol and lovastatin) [4]. The theory has been extended to predict the thermodynamic properties of aqueous electrolyte solutions [5]. In this contribution, we highlight the current capabilities of the SAFT-\u03b3 Mie approach with a focus on the groups developed for the description of new chemical families.

A correlation that provides the best fit for the Henry constants data for all the six gases, with the accuracy (absolute average deviation %) of 4.2%, is recommended. For N2, O2, H2, Ar, and CO, the combined standard uncertainty in the derived Henry constants is less than 6%, whereas for CH4, due to a larger deviation between the utilized data, the uncertainty is less than 18%. Analysis of the temperature variation of the vapor\u2013liquid distribution coefficient at infinite dilution shows that when all the six gases are present in the CO2 stream, separation of N2, O2, Ar, and CO from CO2 can be problematic due to their similar volatilities, while the distinct volatilities of H2 and CH4 at lower temperatures make their separation from CO2 easier.", "year": 2022}, {"paperId": "19ff3ac2993a781d1e6a2a29ad79cdc1c1a10f7e", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 207922603}, "title": "Title Cross-border CO 2 infrastructure options for a CCS demonstration in Finland", "abstract": "As the geographic situation of Finland seems to allow no domestic carbon sequestration, cross-border CO2 logistics is needed. In this paper, the alternative transportation options for CO2 from a Finnish capture plant case are assessed. The assessment includes selection of the most favourable storage areas, route planning for both ship and pipeline transportation, and cost estimates for both alternatives. An actual CCS demonstration is planned by the proprietor power companies of the chosen case plant, a coal condensing power plant on the coast of Western Finland, giving an interesting opportunity to discuss the results in the light of the current development of the demonstration plant. Transportation costs are presented for a ship transportation chain from the case plant to the North Sea and for a pipeline running towards the coast of the Barents Sea. The storage areas were chosen because of the potential storage capacity and currently operational injection activities in both regions. Pipeline transportation is found considerably more expensive than ship transportation as an option for CO2 transportation from the case demonstration plant to the different storage sites. The levelized costs of shipping the captured CO2 to the geological formations under the North Sea are estimated to amount to 11,8 \u20ac/tCO2, excluding the costs for liquefaction. Matching a CO2 source within EU to a sink outside EU depends on a consistent regulatory framework. In addition to accountability of emissions allowances within the EU Emission Trading Scheme (ETS), the issues include liabilities of CO2 handling and storage, other legislation both on national and on Community level as well as international maritime conventions. \u00a9 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

The combustion products only contain water vaper and CO2, both of which are easy to be seperated from gas mixture by condensation. Then the liquid water can be used to recycle the thermal energy from the exhaust gas and is directly injected into the cylinder during the combustion process. CO2 is captured and stored in a tank. As a consequence, an engine system of high effiency and ultralow emissions is achieved. Such closed cycle diesel enging has already been introduced on submarine knowned as closed cycle diesel/air independent propulsion (CCD/AIP) [2]. Due to the addition of carbon dioxide, the specific heat ratio of the intake air changes, which seriously affects the combustion process of the diesel engine and causes low combustion temperature and low ideal engine cycle efficiency. In order to diminish this effect, using argon blending carbon dioxide as buffer gas ensures that air mixture meets the proper requirments for diesel combustion.

PETRONAS has the ambition to make Malaysia a regional carbon storage hub and with that in mind, has the strategic plan for CCS deployment across the depleted gas fields in Malaysia with an estimate of 46 trillion cubic feet of storage volume in total. Sarawak Basin, Malaysia has a large numbers of hydrocarbon fields with high CO2 content which are yet to be developed. CCS is required for developing these high CO2 fields to be in line with net zero carbon direction of PETRONAS. After initial screening and risk management assessment, some of the depleted carbonate fields in the region are considered for the next phase of study related to the deployment of CO2 storage. The field discussed in this paper is believed to have common strong aquifer with neighbouring fields and has a highly heterogeneous reservoir. It also has anumber of extensive and localized baffles/barriers together with highly karstified areas, resulting in significant variations of reservoir characteristics and hence, dramatically affect the flow behaviour in the reservoir, in terms of pressure and water breakthrough. With its high porosity and permeability properties, high compaction and subsidence resulted from pore collapse phenomenon was observed in the reservoir and seabed, respectively. These behaviours need to be captured accurately during the CCS assessment for a reliable estimation of hydrocarbon in place, hydrocarbon interval and aquifer pressures, reservoir compaction, seabed subsidence and hence, the CO2 storage capacity. Dynamic reservoir simulation coupled with geomechanical modelling was used in the study to accurately predict the reservoir and overburden behaviours in the complex reservoir which was necessary for the CO2 storage capacity assessment. In the 2-way fully coupled dynamic-geomechanics modelling, geomechanical analysis is conducted to evaluate the field behaviour including reservoir compaction, seabed subsidence, fault stability and caprock integrity. With the change in the pressure and temperature, either by production or injection, the reservoir stress will change with associated deformation which in turn change the porosity and permeability which will subsequently impact the new pressure distribution and corresponding compaction and subsidence. In addition, the stress changes could result in fault reactivation and caprock integrity breach. Due to the interaction, the stress state was[WT1] updated by coupling the effects of geomechanics on reservoir simulation, so that the compaction and stress changes in the field can be honoured to accurately match the seabed subsidence and reservoir pressure distribution. These enable robust prediction of the storage capacity of the reservoir as well as field integrity. The 2-way fully coupled dynamic-geomechanics study results drive key decisions in the planning of the CCS strategy development and provide answers related to caprock integrity, fault stability, reservoir injection pressure upper limit, storage capacity, long term fluid containment and monitoring program to mitigate potential geological leakage in the long term.

Among them, chemical looping combustion (CLC) and calcium looping (CaL) are getting increasing attention recently as the prospective alternatives to the existing amine scrubbing. Both methods use metal oxides in the process and consist of cyclic reactions. Yet, due to their cyclic nature, they both need to resolve sintering-induced cyclic stability deterioration. Moreover, the structure of the metal oxides needs to be optimized to enhance the overall performance of CO2 capture and storage. Deposition of thin film coating on the metal oxide is another way to get rid of wear and tear during the sintering process. Chemical vapor deposition or atomic layer deposition are the well-known, established methods to form thin film membranes, which will be discussed in this review.

IGCC power plants are demonstrating better results, both in terms of plant performance and economics, when compared to a Pulverised Coal (PC) power plant with CO2 capture. The additional components required for an IGCC power plant when it is desired to operate in CO2 capture mode, give research potential with respect to an improved IGCC power plant performance. The IGCC power plant design framework studied and developed was based in DOE/NETL report and is presented. The conventional and CO2 capture IGCC power plants have been benchmarked in rigorous process flow diagrams developed using the commercial software Honeywell UniSim Design R400. As an essential part of the Innovative Gas Separations for Carbon Capture project (IGSCC EPSRC \u2013 EP/G062129/1) predictive simulation tools were produced to investigate the IGCC performance. The case studies considered include different gasification options for non-capture and carbon capture IGCCs, with a two stage Selexol process for the CO2 capture cases. Particular effort has been made to produce an accurate simulation component to describe the behaviour of the syngas in the Selexol solvent. The two stage Selexol configuration was investigated in detail and novel schemes are presented. No similar approaches have been reported in the literature, in terms of the proposed configuration and the capture efficiency. Moreover, innovative CO2 capture schemes incorporating combined units of physical absorption and membranes have been examined with respect to the power plant\u2019s performance. In this thesis, contrary to other studies, all simulations cases have been conducted in unified flow diagrams. The results presented include overall investigations and can be a helpful tool for engineers and stakeholders in the decision making process.

Keep Ithaca always in your mind. Arriving there is what you are destined for. But do not hurry the journey at all. Better if it lasts for years, so you are old by the time you reach the island, wealthy with all you have gained on the way. Do not expect Ithaca to make you rich. Ithaca gave you the marvellous journey. Without her you would not have set out. She has nothing left to give you now. And if you find her poor, Ithaca won\u2019t have deceived you. Wise as you will have become, so full of experience, you will have understood by then what these Ithacas mean.

To this purpose, Mediterranean forest soils in Southern and Central Italy were examined. Sites differed for elevation, climate, parent material and vegetation conditions, while summer drought was the common ecological factor. A morpho-functional criterion, based on holorganic layers thickness and A horizon properties, was used to classify humus forms, which ranged from Dysmoder to Eumull. Such variability allowed understanding of factors influencing organic matter storage. The relations between carbon stock and humus form were investigated for the topsoil layer (0\u201320\u00a0cm), which was supposed to contain the soil C pools most sensitive to climate change. We found that humus forms can be grouped in statistically different populations, with respect to topsoil C stocks. The use of A horizon structure was the main diagnostic criterion and represented the most effective approach to humus classification in Mediterranean conditions.

The study is based on a second-generation oxy-CFB technology evaluation, SWOT analysis and product life-cycle estimation. The commercialization of second-generation oxy-fuel technology, estimated as a basis of oxy-CFB technology, is largely found to be dependent on technical, sociological and economical aspects related to the energy market environment. The CO2 price in European Union (EU) emissions trading is currently below 10 \u20ac/ton, which does not favour investment in CCS. CO2 storage also faces public opposition and EU directive limitations. The CO2 price needs to be in the range of 30 \u20ac/ton by 2030, the estimated time of commercialization. Technological development or subsidies would also be required for the second-generation oxy-CFB power production concept to become viable.

In mature and desiccated aap1 seeds the total N and carbon content was reduced while the total free amino acid levels were strongly increased. Separately analysed embryos and seed coats/endosperm of mature seeds showed that the elevated amounts in amino acids were caused by an accumulation in the seed coat/endosperm, demonstrating that a decrease in uptake of amino acids by the aap1 embryo affects the N pool in the seed coat/endosperm. Also, the number of protein bodies was increased in the aap1 endosperm, suggesting that the accumulation of free amino acids triggered protein synthesis. Analysis of seed storage compounds revealed that the total fatty acid content was unchanged in aap1 seeds, but storage protein levels were decreased. Expression analysis of genes of seed N transport, metabolism and storage was in agreement with the biochemical data. In addition, seed weight, as well as total silique and seed number, was reduced in the mutants.

In addition, it is the only available option to reduce emissions from industrial processes. It has enormous potential for global impact by capturing 90+% of CO2 and other emissions from power plants and industry. It will be needed, alongside other low emissions technologies, to create a cost-effective carbon neutral future. This paper, based on a study commissioned by the Australian based CO2CRC, presents another dimension to previous work on CCS by examining the significant job creation potential the inclusion of low emission fossil fuels in a balanced low emissions energy mix can deliver. This low emissions paradigm is demonstrated through a case study which progressively retrofits CCS to six 500 MW power stations in the Latrobe Valley over twelve years removing 90% of the CO2 from the emissions and permanently storing it in the offshore Gippsland Basin. The emission intensity of the retrofitted units is one-third of the recently announced emission limits under the Victorian Coal Policy of 0.45 tonne CO2/MWh and would reduce emissions by over 20 million tonnes CO2 pa. The investment estimated for capture and storage infrastructure would be in the order of $10 billionwith close to $7 billion local content, the majority of which will be spent in the wider Gippsland regions. A preliminary jobs analysis of the project was conducted using an input-output tool developed for regional infrastructure. The tool and methodology, described in the paper, uses census data for regional Australia and calculates outputs based on the project expenditure profile. Job creation is significant, delivering an average of 5315 new Victorian jobs each year over the 12year life of the project (see table below). These include jobs within the CCS project (direct) and those in supporting industries and infrastructure (indirect). Most of the new employment occurs in the Gippsland region with an annual average increase of 4064, representing a 13% increase in regional jobs (10% in construction and 3% in ongoing operational jobs). More than 1200 additional jobs will be created beyond the local region to provide expertise and services required for project development and delivery. 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 203", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "c168fba94920f6dbfad4efdaf20ab18e23d8da57", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2770326202", "CorpusId": 116305294}, "title": "Carbon Dioxide (CO2) injection into a partially-depleted gas condensate reservoir: A case study for optimal storage and re-use for field life-cycle extension through enhanced hydrocarbon recovery", "abstract": "A pilot for a large scale, fully integrated chain of CO2 capture, transport and storage (CCS) has been initiated in the port of Rotterdam. The initiative aims to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of CCS and show that it can be deployed on a large scale for power plants and energy-intensive industries that emit large volumes of CO2. The partially-depleted Q16-Maas gas condensate field could potentially be used to permanently store the captured greenhouse gas (CO2). The case study shows the potential that this field has for CO2 storage and also examines other options for life-cycle extension. The case study is based on macroscopic scale reservoir behaviour and simulated in the fully compositional simulator, Eclipse 300. Gas reservoirs have a proven track record for safely trapping gaseous phases in the subsurface over long geological timescales. As long as initial reservoir conditions, mainly pressure (=296,5 bar), are not exceeded, CO2 in supercritical phase should be safely stored. According to literature, with increasing storage time, the CO2 is even trapped more securely, although this process may take hundreds to thousands of years. The results of the case study show that approximately 1.1 million tonnes of pure CO2 can be stored in Q16-Maas field. By side-tracking the original well and producing the attic gas in the reservoir, 160 million cubic meters of additional gas can be recovered, along with condensate. If the side-tracked well is then converted to a CO2-injection well, the CO2 storage capacity is increased to 1.4 million tonnes. This injectable CO2 volume is less than the two million tonnes originally estimated and this is due to the influx of water from a strong aquifer that has partially filled the void left by depleting the gas field. The possibility of enhanced gas and condensate recovery using CO2 has also been investigated in this case study, as the use of CO2 for miscible floods in hydrocarbon reservoirs has been proven and used successfully as a tertiary recovery method. The reservoir simulation of the Q16-Maas field shows that there is no additional hydrocarbon recovery by CO2 flooding. Sidetracking to and producing from an updip location in the reservoir is equally as productive. The reason for this is attributed to presence of a strong water aquifer, together with the varying reservoir quality and thickness prevents the successful application of CO2 enhanced hydrocarbon recovery. The total cost of transport and storage (OPEX and CAPEX) was estimated to be 71.5 million euro.

Cities have become increasingly interested in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, and increasing carbon sequestration and storage in urban vegetation and soil as part of their climate mitigation actions. However, most of our knowledge on biogenic carbon cycle is based on data and models from forested ecosystems even though urban nature and microclimate are very different to those in natural or forested ecosystems. There is a need for modelling tools that can correctly consider temporal variations of urban carbon cycle and take the urban specific conditions into account. The main aims of this study are to examine the carbon sequestration potential of two commonly used street tree species (Tilia x vulgaris and Alnus glutinosa) and their soils by taking into account the complexity of urban conditions, and evaluate urban land surface model SUEWS and soil carbon model Yasso15 in simulating carbon sequestration of these street tree plantings at different temporal scales (diurnal, monthly and annual). SUEWS provides the urban microclimate, and photosynthesis and respiration of street trees whereas the soil carbon storage is estimated with Yasso. Both models were run for 2002\u20132016 and within this period the model performances were evaluated against transpiration estimated from sap flow, soil carbon content and soil moisture measurements from two street tree sites located in Helsinki, Finland. The models were able to capture the variability in urban carbon cycle due to changes in environmental conditions and tree species. SUEWS simulated the stomatal control and transpiration well (RMSE\u2009<\u20090.31\u2009mm\u2009h\u22121) and was able to produce correct soil moisture in the street soil (nRMSE\u2009<\u20090.23). Yasso was able to simulate the strong decline in initial carbon content but later overestimated respiration and thus underestimated carbon stock slightly (MBE\u2009>\u2009\u22125.42\u2009kg\u2009C\u2009m\u22122). Over the study period, soil respiration dominated the carbon exchange over carbon sequestration, due to the high initial carbon loss from the soil after the street construction. However, the street tree plantings turned into a modest sink of carbon from the atmosphere on annual scale as the tree and soil respiration approximately balanced photosynthesis. The compensation point when street trees plantings turned from annual source to sink was reached faster by Alnus trees after 12\u2009years, while by Tilia trees after 14\u2009years.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports that global average CO2 concentration was 405 ppm in 2017, the highest concentration recorded in over 800,000 years. As chemical engineers, we are actively engaged in understanding the relationship between energy generation and atmospheric CO2 and seeking new ways to generate energy that do not produce CO2. In addition to developing these new alternative energy technologies, we are also engaged in removing CO2 from the effluent stream, thereby reducing the impact of burning fossil fuels or \u201ccapturing\u201d carbon when biofuels are consumed. Likewise, engineers are actively working on technologies that can remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Once the CO2 is obtained, it is important that it be utilized or stored so that it is not returned to the atmosphere or not added to the growing carbon stock already present. Sequestration techniques require the capture and storage of CO2, which means better understanding of the adsorption processes and the development of new sorbents that can achieve higher capture rates. Beyond that, CO2 can be used as a raw material from which chemicals can be produced, reducing the consumption of new fossil resources while simultaneously taking this greenhouse gas from the atmosphere. This issue was developed in part to expand on the current global conversation around climate change and the impact of emissions from fossil fuel combustion. The recent actions taken during COP 24 in Poland, although not as substantial as most would have liked, demonstrate the global objective to place limits on our carbon emissions, and scientists across the world are seeking new technical solutions that can guide policymakers on viable choices. Several of the manuscripts included in this special section can speak directly to those needs and opportunities. The current issue includes a compilation of recent submissions to Environmental Progress & Sustainable Energy that investigates many facets of the CO2 challenge. In addition to the concerns expressed through the classical discussion of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), we evaluate both the relationship between carbon emissions and climate change and the use of policy to modify industrial behavior, as well as the impacts of bioenergy and other sources from a life cycle approach. The special section begins with a review article describing the driving forces for climate change, and in particular looks at opportunities for mitigation. The following five contributions provide further description of the use of policy to modify behavior and the relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth. These papers provide an excellent discussion on the relationship, or more precisely, the lack of correlation between economic benefit and carbon emissions, leading to recognition that the development of smart restriction on emissions will not necessarily impact the economic success of either a business or the nation, and by extension, provides a roadmap for environmentally friendly economic prosperity. In the next six contributions, authors address the issues of CCUS. In the first of these papers, the development of new sorbent materials and the analysis of their performance for CO2 capture are described. Following is a series of papers that consider new ways in which CO2 can be converted to chemicals or fuels through catalytic means. Thermodynamic analysis describes the preferred conditions under which CO2 can potentially be converted to desired products, taking this resource from the atmosphere and making it a viable feedstock. Finally, one contribution discusses CO2 storage in biological systems, which has the added advantage of providing a viable pathway for the production of useful products. The last section comprises five contributions that describe alternatives to traditional fossil fuel combustion and explores life cycle issues associated with these energy resources. Ranging from a discussion of energy diversification to a detailed analysis of two alternative energy strategies, this section considers a variety of options that can be explored as we transition to a low carbon future. Overall, this special section encompasses much of the current thinking related to the reduction of carbon emissions, the utilization of CO2 that can ameliorate its presence and provide useful products, and storage options. The discussions around the relationship between CO2 emissions, alternate energy choices, and economic growth suggest a path forward that should be of interest to all readers, but should be especially useful in working to develop long-term strategies in keeping with the suggestions of the COP 24 outcomes.

Ixora coccinea has the highest biomass accumulation (646.4160 kg), followed by Tabernae montana (220.9966 kg), and Baphia nitida (129.5640 kg) on species abundance. The total biomass captured by the all the species is 1319.2486 kg (1.3192 tons) of carbon. Hence, species of non-timber plants in UTHM have the capacities to absorb a substantial quantity of CO 2 from the atmosphere thus contributing to reducing the effects of world-wide warming and climate alteration.", "year": 2017}]}
