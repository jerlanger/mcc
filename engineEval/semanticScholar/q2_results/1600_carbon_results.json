CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is a technology in its infancy with no full-scale commercial application and there are only a handful of full-scale storage projects globally. CO2 storage is almost completely unknown whereas RW disposal has been the subject of highly charged (often unresolved) political debates for decades and all matters nuclear are viewed as both the subject of fear and fascination in the broader cultural and political context. Nevertheless, there are some notable similarities, including: the difficulty of extricating not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) considerations from other concerns; the inability to divorce the politics of waste streams from the underlying electricity generating technologies; the challenge of communicating the highly technical nature of both issues; and the role that both CO2 storage and RW play in the larger debate over energy policy, particularly as a proxy issue for non-governmental organizations. A key question identified is whether CCS will continue to be portrayed as the saviour of fossil fuels or whether it becomes an Achilles\u2019 heel, much as resolving RW has become a necessary condition for further expansion of nuclear power. It is too early to draw any firm conclusions regarding the acceptability of CO2 storage because of the current low levels of awareness. Nevertheless, the nature of the CO2 storage problem tends to support the view that it will be less controversial than RW because of the large number of storage sites needed, public familiarity with CO2 and the need to resolve storage at the very beginning before CCS can proceed on large point source facilities.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "e9736436f1bc7f48bcc43ea7bbb51738b006a0bc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2466508277", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02401", "CorpusId": 23294750, "PubMed": "27548051"}, "title": "New Approach for High-Voltage Electrical Double-Layer Capacitors Using Vertical Graphene Nanowalls with and without Nitrogen Doping.", "abstract": "Integrating various devices to achieve high-performance energy storage systems to satisfy various demands in modern societies become more and more important. Electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), one kind of the electrochemical capacitors, generally provide the merits of high charge-discharge rates, extremely long cycle life, and high efficiency in electricity capture/storage, leading to a desirable device of electricity management from portable electronics to hybrid vehicles or even smart grid application. However, the low cell voltage (2.5-2.7 V in organic liquid electrolytes) of EDLCs lacks the direct combination of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) and EDLCs for creating new functions in future applications without considering the issue of a relatively low energy density. Here we propose a guideline, \"choosing a matching pair of electrode materials and electrolytes\", to effectively extend the cell voltage of EDLCs according to three general strategies. Based on the new strategy proposed in this work, materials with an inert surface enable to tolerate a wider potential window in commercially available organic electrolytes in comparison with activated carbons (ACs). The binder-free, vertically grown graphene nanowalls (GNW) and nitrogen-doped GNW (NGNW) electrodes respectively provide good examples for extending the upper potential limit of a positive electrode of EDLCs from 0.1 to 1.5 V (vs Ag/AgNO3) as well as the lower potential limit of a negative electrode of EDLCs from -2.0 V to ca. -2.5 V in 1 M TEABF4/PC (propylene carbonate) compared to ACs.

The paper identifies a number of existing policies from four key areas \u2013 energy/transport, agriculture, sub-soil, and oceans \u2013 which will have an impact on three NETs: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), Direct Air Capture (DAC), and terrestrial Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW). We propose that non-climate co-benefits may be valuable in terms of the policy \u2018demand pull\u2019 for NETs; in particular, we find that ERW may provide multiple co-benefits which can be mandated through existing policy structures. However, interaction with numerous policy areas may also create barriers, particularly where there is tension between the priorities of different government departments. On the basis of existing and analogous policies from a range of geographical contexts and scales, this paper proposes four options for NETs policy that could be reasonably implemented in the near-term. We also argue that ERW demonstrates the importance of scale and framing, because the policy environment depends on whether it is framed as a soil amendment at local scales or as a climate stabilization technique at international scale. Key policy insights Co-benefits may assist the \u2018demand pull\u2019 for novel technologies by providing multiple policy angles for incentivisation rather than relying on a \u2018fix-all\u2019 policy such as a high carbon price. DAC with storage might be overly reliant on a high carbon price, because it only provides one core benefit \u2013 that of atmospheric carbon reduction. ERW may provide multiple co-benefits which can be mandated through existing policy structures, but should focus on using waste rock rather than mining virgin material. We propose four near-term options for NETs policy: funding for small-scale BECCS demonstration and an international biomass certification mechanism; small-scale loans for ERW on farms and promotion of locally-sourced rock residues; amendment of fertilizer subsidy schemes to include silicate rock; and a clearer framework for licensing sub-soil access for CO2 storage.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "1e13f101f025042c15b3df89d2a3b851ed4003c9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1975607429", "DOI": "10.1016/S1750-5836(07)00028-X", "CorpusId": 94425297}, "title": "Regulatory challenges to the implementation of carbon capture and geological storage within the European Union under EU and international law", "abstract": null, "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "f4f0a0830df7c48878588a910e9fb8ed48ab5263", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3131350358", "DOI": "10.1016/J.APENERGY.2021.116510", "CorpusId": 233594590}, "title": "A review of large-scale CO2 shipping and marine emissions management for carbon capture, utilisation and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "46b20a2ca62cea70d2f507d09751f7b0af178ab3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2072995309", "DOI": "10.3390/EN6052644", "CorpusId": 111009976}, "title": "Life Cycle GHG of NG-Based Fuel and Electric Vehicle in China", "abstract": "This paper compares the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of natural gas (NG)- based fuels to the GHG emissions of electric vehicles (EVs) powered with NG-to-electricity in China.

This report was the first attempt to obtain a picture of this potential. In the paper the main findings of the 2004 report are summarized. In the introduction the background for the study is presented as well as the main goals of the project. The sources and quantities as well as the composition of the carbon dioxide containing waste streams were compiled. The potential for biological, geological, chemical and marine storage was determined and it was found that the biological storage potential is limited, the chemical storage potential is largely unknown, the geological storage potential may be large, but further study is required. The marine storage potential is probably very large, but the environmental impact may be serious. 1. General introduction Internationally and nationally the potential for the sequestration of carbon dioxide is increasingly receiving attention (Carbon Capture and Storage, CCS), (IPCC,2005) due to the growing levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouses gases in the atmosphere. South Africa has acceded to the Kyoto Protocol as a non-Annex I country, which e.g. means that South Africa currently has no obligations regarding the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. (Kyoto, 1997)) However the current protocol will expire in 2013 and there is significant pressure from developed countries on non-Annex I countries to also develop policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as part of a follow-up Kyoto protocol (Stern, 2006). One policy option is to undertake a CCS program and therefore DME contracted CSIR to undertake a preliminary study on the potential for CCS in South Africa.( In this paper the outcomes of the study are reported. The detailed report is available at the DME web page. (Engelbrecht \u2018et al\u2019, 2004) The overall goals of the study were: \u2022 To generate a knowledge base of the biological and geological potential for sequestration of CO2 in South Africa. \u2022 To publish such information for general use. 2. Scope of the study The study had the following components: \u2022 To identify and quantify major CO2 point sources and locations and to estimate the gas compositions associated with the different point sources. \u2022 Report on total biological sequestration potential in South Africa. \u2022 Report on the suitability of geological sequestration potential relevant to the large point sources of CO2. \u2022 Report on chemical sequestration potential. \u2022 Report on the marine sequestration potential. \u2022 Present conclusions of the study 3.

Migration of CO2 back to the atmosphere via leakage through geological faults is a potential high impact risk to CO2 storage integrity. Here, we\u00a0calculate for the first time natural leakage rates from a 420 ka paleo-record of CO2 leakage above a naturally occurring, faulted, CO2 reservoir in Arizona, USA. Surface travertine (CaCO3) deposits provide evidence of vertical CO2 leakage linked to known faults. U-Th dating of travertine deposits shows leakage varies along a single fault and that individual seeps have lifespans of up to 200 ka. Whilst the total volumes of CO2 required to form the travertine deposits are high,\u00a0time-averaged leakage equates to a linear rate of less than 0.01%/yr.

These results indicated that the ANN model could predict the CO2 storage and oil recovery with high accuracy, and it can be applied as a robust tool to determine the feasibility in the early stage of CCUS in ROZs.

One of the emerging methods in CO2 capture research is based on the use of gas-hydrate crystallization in confined porous media. Pore dimensions and surface functionality of the pores play important roles in the efficiency of CO2 capture. In this report, we summarize work on several porous carbons (PCs) that differ in pore dimensions that range from supermicropores to mesopores, as well as surfaces ranging from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. Water was imbibed into the PCs and the CO2 uptake performance, in dry and hydrated forms, was determined at pressures of up to 54 bar to reveal the influence of pore characteristics on the efficiency of CO2 capture and storage. The final hydrated carbon materials had H2O to carbon weight ratios of 1.5:1. Upon CO2 capture, the H2O/CO2 molar ratio was found to be as low as 1.8, which indicates a far greater CO2 capture capacity in hydrated PCs than ordinarily seen in CO2-hydrate formations, wherein the H2O/CO2 ratio is 5.72. Our mechanistic proposal for attainment of such a low H2O/CO2 ratio within the PCs is based on the finding that most of the CO2 is captured in gaseous form within micropores of diameter < 2 nm, wherein it is blocked by external CO2-hydrate formations generated in the larger mesopores. Therefore, in order to have efficient high pressure CO2 capture by this mechanism, it is necessary to have PCs with a wide pore size distribution consisting of both micropores and mesopores. Furthermore, we found that hydrated microporous or supermicroporous PCs do not show any hysteretic CO2 uptake behavior, which indicates that CO2-hydrates cannot be formed within micropores of diameter 1-2 nm. Alternatively, mesoporous and macroporous carbons can accommodate higher yields of CO2-hydrates, which potentially limits the CO2 uptake capacity in those larger pores to a H2O/CO2 ratio of 5.72. We found that high nitrogen content prevents the formation of CO2-hydrates presumably due to their destabilization and associated increase in system entropy via stronger noncovalent interactions between the nitrogen functional groups and H2O or CO2.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "f12c1fb1fde288b55a4bbae3e8180a04ca1c4072", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2025947948", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENERGY.2012.07.014", "CorpusId": 109150508}, "title": "Scenarios for the environmental impact of fossil fuel power: Co-benefits and trade-offs of carbon capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "120847b4c781cab0c2432862ef29aed071a89926", "externalIds": {"MAG": "587556110", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-444-63455-9.50015-5", "CorpusId": 92905237}, "title": "Assessment of Hydrogen Production Systems based on Natural Gas Conversion with Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "46611847c3f726031d46793ca81495c605411ed7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2021138571", "DOI": "10.1007/S11027-005-2080-X", "CorpusId": 153813785}, "title": "Geological CO2 Storage as a Climate Change Mitigation Option", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage is increasingly being considered as an important climate change mitigation option. This paper explores provisions for including geological CO2 storage in climate policy. The storage capacity of Norway's Continental Shelf is alone sufficient to store a large share of European CO2 emissions for many decades. If CO2 is injected into oil reservoirs there is an additional benefit in terms of enhanced oil recovery. However, there are significant technical and economic challenges, including the large investment in infrastructure required, with related economies of scale properties. Thus CO2 capture, transportation and storage projects are likely to be more economically attractive if developed on a large scale, which could mean involving two or more nations. An additional challenge is the risk of future leakages from storage sites, where the government must take on a major responsibility. In institutional and policy terms, important challenges are the unsettled status of geological CO2 storage as a policy measure in the Kyoto Protocol, lack of relevant reporting and verification procedures, and lack of decisions on how the option should be linked to the flexibility mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol. In terms of competitiveness with expected prices for CO2 permits under Kyoto Protocol trading, the relatively high costs per tonne of CO2 stored means that geological CO2 storage is primarily of interest where enhanced oil recovery is possible. These shortcomings and uncertainties mean that companies and governments today only have weak incentives to venture into geological CO2 storage.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "e42e2fa7c9dcdfd288b855a42173e7de0c41f3b7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2996890745", "PubMedCentral": "6930215", "DOI": "10.1038/s41598-019-56378-y", "CorpusId": 209474522, "PubMed": "31875027"}, "title": "Bulk and interfacial properties of decane in the presence of carbon dioxide, methane, and their mixture", "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to study the bulk and interfacial properties of methane\u2009+\u2009n-decane, carbon dioxide\u2009+\u2009n-decane, and methane\u2009+\u2009carbon dioxide\u2009+\u2009n-decane systems under geological conditions.

In general, both the gas solubility and the swelling factor increase with increasing pressure and decreasing temperature. Interestingly, the methane solubility and the swelling of the methane\u2009+\u2009n-decane system are not strongly influenced by temperature. Our results also show that the presence of methane increases the interfacial tension (IFT) of the carbon dioxide\u2009+\u2009n-decane system.

The large scale implementation of the technology mandates better understanding of the risks associated with CO(2) injection into geologic formations and the subsequent interactions with groundwater resources. The injected supercritical CO(2) (sc-CO(2)) is a nonpolar solvent that can potentially mobilize organic compounds that exist at residual saturation in the formation. Here, we review the partitioning behavior of selected organic compounds typically found in depleted oil reservoirs in the residual oil-brine-sc-CO(2) system under carbon storage conditions. The solubility of pure phase organic compounds in sc-CO(2) and partitioning of organic compounds between water and sc-CO(2) follow trends predicted based on thermodynamics. Compounds with high volatility and low aqueous solubility have the highest potential to partition to sc-CO(2). The partitioning of low volatility compounds to sc-CO(2) can be enhanced by cosolvency due to the presence of higher volatility compounds in the sc-CO(2).

Carbon dioxide capture, transport, and storage (CCS) from fossil fuel fired power plants is drawing increased interest as an intermediate solution towards sustainable energy systems in the long term. However, CCS is still facing some challenges, such as large scale implementation requires high energy demands and leads to high cost. Innovation and optimization of the capture process is needed to reduce the energy requirement and to minimize the investment cost in order to make CCS viable for application in the near future. The CO2 post-combustion capture based on the absorption/desorption process with monoethanolamine (MEA) solutions, is considered as the state-of-art technology. In this thesis, the MEA process has been defined as the reference case for the purposes of comparison and benchmarking. By analysing the MEA reference case, it can be concluded that this is an energy intensive process due to the regeneration energy of the MEA solution (4 GJ/tonne CO2). For this conventional process, major energy savings can be realized by optimizing the lean solvent loading, the amine solvent concentration, as well as the stripper operating pressure. A minimum thermal energy requirement of 3.0 GJ/tonne CO2 can be obtained using a 40 wt. % MEA solution and a stripper operating pressure of 210 kPa. Significant energy and cost savings can be achieved by increasing the MEA concentration in the absorption solution. It is, however, still to be investigated if high MEA concentrations can be used due to possible corrosion and solvent degradation. Increasing the temperature (operating pressure) in the stripper will lead to a higher efficiency of the regeneration and will reduce thermal energy requirement. Moreover, a high operating pressure will reduce the cost and the energy needed for CO2 compression. The economic baseline for CO2 post-combustion capture using MEA is defined using 600 MWe coal fired power plant as a reference case and assuming 2005 as the reference year, 8% discount factor and 25 years as a project life. The process modelling results are used for providing the required input to the economic modelling. The economic evaluation for the MEA conventional process has shown that this process will lead to a cost of ~40 \u0080/tonne CO2 avoided. Using the baseline techno-economic evaluation as a starting point, a parameter study for the conventional CO2 post-combustion capture process is performed. The main operating variables considered in this study were the MEA solvent concentration, the CO2 removal percentage, the solvent lean loading, and the stripper operating pressure. The economic results show a minimum CO2 avoided cost of 33 \u0080/tonne CO2 with an optimized process conditions of 0.3 mol CO2/mol MEA lean solvent loading, using a 40 wt. % MEA solution and a stripper operating pressure of 210 kPa. This translates to 53 \u0080/MWh cost of electricity, compared to 31 \u0080/MWh for the power plant without capture. The difference in costs per tonne CO2 avoided is small for CO2 removal in the range between 80% and 95%. The CO2 post-combustion capture process overall performance is evaluated using pilot plant experimental results. Two different modelling approaches (equilibrium-stage and rate-based) are validated and compared using these large-scale pilot plant data. Equilibrium-stage and rate-based models are implemented using the commercial Aspen plus simulation tool. The study indicates that there are no major differences between the two modelling approaches in predicting the overall capture process behaviour for this pilot plant case (e.g. regeneration energy requirement, CO2 removal % and solvent rich loading). Hence an equilibrium-stage model was preferred as the basis for over-all process modelling and benchmarking different capture solvents in view of its lesser complexity. The rate-based model, however, did yield more accurate predictions of the temperature profiles and mass transfer inside the columns. As a result, for a detailed process design or understanding of the mass and energy profiles in the absorber and stripper columns, the rate-based approach should be applied. The Hypogen concept (electricity generation with co-production of hydrogen) is considered one of the future energy options. This option will facilitate the use of a clean source of energy (hydrogen) for purposes like transportation and heating. This concept is based on the use of syngas for power production with CO2 post-combustion capture incorporating the possibility of co-production of hydrogen (5-10% of the total syngas). In this concept, hydrogen is produced and purified in two different methods. The first method is based on increasing hydrogen content using the water gas shift reaction, followed by the separation of hydrogen from CO2 using a high-pressure absorber. This absorber column is integrated with the ambient post-combustion capture process. The second method is based on the separation of hydrogen from syngas using polymeric membranes. In both options, the hydrogen will be further purified using a pressure swing adsorption system. Both options are feasible with an overall CO2 capture cost comparable to the conventional post-combustion capture process. However, there are some limitations in the hydrogen purity using polymeric membranes. The advantage of the high-pressure absorber is more obvious if an advanced solvent, like the sterically hindered 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP), is used instead of a conventional solvent like MEA. Increasing the CO2 content in the flue gas is investigated by recycling the flue gas over the gas turbine. The flue gas recycle is beneficial for the overall capture process behaviour. The total flue gas flow rate is reduced with increasing flue gas recycle ratio. This reduction in the flue gas flow rate results in a smaller absorber column. The capital investment, the cost of electricity and cost of CO2 avoided are reduced with increasing the flue gas recycle ratio. There is a marginal effect of the flue gas recycle on the solvent regeneration energy using the conventional MEA solvent. This is due to the limitation in MEA solvent capacity. Moreover, the effect of the flue gas recycle on the energy requirement and the overall cost is more significant using a different solvent with higher loading capacity (e.g. AMP). As has been observed out of the MEA conventional process analysis, the desorption energy requirement is a significant burden for large-scale applications. To overcome the high-energy demand and to increase the operational flexibility, a new process concept is investigated. This process concept is based on dividing the CO2 capture process into a bulk removal step and a deep removal step using two different solvent/systems. This two-step concept is evaluated for two different cases. Both cases are based on the use of MEA in the first step. In the second step, either AMP solution or coal/activated carbon is used for the removal of the remaining CO2. The results show that the removal of CO2 using coal or activated carbon is not advantageous due to the large quantity of coal/activated carbon needed. On the hand, the use of the two-chemical solvent has shown potential for possible process improvement. The overall energy requirements for the two-solvent concept can be reduced by 16 % as compared to the MEA reference case. Due to the higher capital costs, the overall cost of carbon dioxide avoided in the 2-step concept increases by 13 %. Still, increasing the capture process flexibility can be an advantage of the 2-step concept. This flexibility allows the application of different operating conditions and/or process systems in the different absorption-desorption units. One of the benefits can be the use of waste heat for regeneration, by operating one of the desorbers at lower temperature. From the analysis of the post-combustion capture process that has been done in this thesis, it is evident that to achieve significant reduction of the capture process cost, multiple process parameters need to be improved. For future development of the CO2 post-combustion capture process, it would be beneficial to direct the solvent development research towards solvents systems, which have lower reaction enthalpy and higher capacity. A significant improvement can be obtained by the development of solvent systems where the solvent is regenerated at higher pressure. In addition, smart process improvement and integration are required to achieve a reasonable cost reduction. Flue gas recycle over the gas turbine can contribute by reducing the overall capital investment. Splitting the capture process and/or combining it with co-production of hydrogen can be an extra economic parameter in the overall process optimization. It can be expected that by improving the process design and the solvent, implementation of post combustion capture on larger scale will be possible in the near future.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "68dc0dc8268417ea28e6a602ec53aa776db3eace", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2126156503", "DOI": "10.1177/002029401304600203", "CorpusId": 110365079}, "title": "Developing Measurement Facilities for Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "This paper describes two experimental facilities developed to carry out research and development of measurement instruments used in the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) industry.

However, the Indonesian Government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel consumption as an effort to mitigate climate change. In view of this, two possible energy scenarios are envisioned to honor this commitment: \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d (BaU) and the National Energy Policy (NEP) scenario (National Energy Council, 2014). The NEP scenario reduces CO2 emissions by up to 26% through an improved energy mix, less reliance on carbon-based fuels, and the deployment of renewable energy sources from 2020 to 2050. However, these actions are considered insufficient to further reduce the CO2 emission target, leading to an initiative to implement carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology. Although Indonesia is a developing country, it has a mature manufacturing industry, which means that carbon-capture utilization (CCU) technology, which converts CO2 into useful products and intermediates, could provide an additional method to complement CCS technology and help decouple economic growth from excessive CO2 emission (Styring et al., 2014). This report reviews how CCS and CCU are applied in Indonesia, particularly in relation to the energy sector.

It also depends upon CCS being seen as just one part of a wider strategy for achieving significant cuts in CO2 emissions. A portfolio including renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency, and lifestyle change to reduce demand was generally favoured. CCS can be part of such a portfolio, but wind, wave, tidal, solar and energy efficiency were preferred.

Evidence is presented for the importance of microsite differences and seasonality in total dark CO2 flux from tundra soils and vegetation. The relative contributions of aboveground and belowground CO2 sources to the total dark CO2 flux from tundra soils and vegetation are estimated at between 36 and 46% for the aboveground contribution and between 54 and 64% for the belowground contribution on a polygon meadow during late June. Contributions of root respiration to total dark CO2 flux from wet tundra are likely to be overestimated if based entirely on controlled laboratory measurements now available. INTRODUCTION The use of carbon in energy capture and storage makes the study of carbon transfers of fundamental importance to, assessing energy flow through an ecosystem. Several aspects of the dynamics of CO2 transfer have been studied for the Barrow tundra ecosystem. Tieszen (1973) has measured the rates of photosynthesis and respiration for those graminoid plant species which constitute most of the vegetation. Coyne and Kelley (1972) have studied CO2 exchange using an aerodynamic approach. Billings et al. (1973) and Billings et al. (1974) have measured root respiration of the dominant graminoids. Microbial respiration and decomposition have been investigated by Benoit et al. (1972) and by Flanagan and Scarborough (1973). The sizes of the various carbon pools in the Alaskan tundra also have been estimated. Dennis and Johnson (1970) and Dennis and Tieszen (1972) have studied the aboveand belowground carbon pools while Tieszen (1972) has measured aboveground primary productivity. Integration of such information should lead to a higher degree of resolution in the knowledge of energy flow and possibly to a predictive model of the carbon transfers in this tundra ecosystem. The results reported in this paper concern the CO2 flux from tundra soils and vegetation to the atmosphere and the relative importance of root respiration and total subsurface CO2 production to the total flux. Sources of CO2 evolved from a vegetated surface may be grouped into three general categonies: 1. CO2 from nonbiological sources, i.e., release of dissolved CO2 from warming water or CO2 displaced from soil pore space by water. 2. CO2 from aboveground respiration, i.e., plant dark respiration and photorespiration, and animal respiration. 3. CO2 from belowground respiration, i.e., root respiration and respiration of soil organisms.", "year": 1975}, {"paperId": "cdfdbebbea8838b43e1db081868b470b6da68011", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2085598193", "DOI": "10.4314/SWJ.V4I3.51848", "CorpusId": 53542282}, "title": "The future of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) in Nigeria", "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one of the techniques for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction.

We show among others the following results: Under a stockdependent CCS cost function, the clean coal exploitation must begin at the earliest when the carbon cap is reached while it must begin before under a flow-dependent cost function. Under stock-dependent cost function with a dominant learning effect, the energy price path can evolve non-monotonically over time. When the solar cost is low enough, this last case can give rise to an unusual sequence of energy consumption along which the solar energy consumption is interrupted for some time and replaced by the clean coal exploitation.

We find that the CO2 concentration field self-organizes as a cellular network structure in the diffusive boundary layer at the top boundary. By studying the statistics of the cellular network, we identify various regimes of finger coarsening over time, the existence of a non-equilibrium stationary state, and a universal scaling of three-dimensional convective mixing.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "6ed40eadfe307eab05df777c669aafe4fd1e5961", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2761417032", "DOI": "10.3390/SU9101840", "CorpusId": 8501652}, "title": "A Review of the Role of Vegetal Ecosystems in CO2 Capture", "abstract": "The reduction of carbon emissions is a worldwide global challenge and represents the objective of many scientists that are trying to modify the role of carbon, turning a problem into an opportunity.

There has thankfully been a significant amount of funding directed towards research into carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies with several major programs worldwide. Most of these efforts have focused on postcombustion capture from large single-point sources like power plants, for several reasons including that they account for about onethird of all global emissions (about 12 gigatons of CO2 per year). Fortunately significant advances in this area have been made and systems to stem the flow of CO2 are being deployed at several locations worldwide. In reality, however, removing these emissions from the equation will not reduce global levels of CO2; it will, at best, modify the trajectory we are currently on. Along with these advances a smaller group of researchers have also focused on various direct air capture (DAC) technologies. Such technologies are complimentary to flue gas capture as they operate based on the same principles and could be used in both scenarios. Over the years there has been some debate regarding the costs and feasibility of removing CO2 from air, including a detailed report by the American Physical Society. These reports have generally focused on chemical absorption processes frequently using solutions of sodium hydroxide or amines generally at high operational costs. A growing number of researchers are taking interest in using solid sorbents for DAC, in part because these have the potential to work at lower regeneration energies than chemical sorbents in solutions. These adsorbents are typically solid-supported amine materials. An initial report by Kulkarni and Sholl detailing the use of such sorbents at several potential U.S. sites indicates that it may be much more economically favorable than previously thought with estimations around $100 per ton of CO2. [5] It is highly likely that DAC may never compete on equal economic footing with postcombustion capture technologies, but it certainly has many advantages, such as proximity to storage sites, reduced pipeline transport costs, and the possibility of addressing CO2 mitigation from all sources, that the higher price tag per ton of CO2 may actually be attractive. DAC systems can also be powered by renewable energy sources and/or used to generate CO2 for productive purpose (feeding greenhouses, or algae installations for biofuel production), thus qualifying them as truly \u201ccarbon-negative technologies\u201d. A key factor to driving down the cost per ton of captured CO2 will be to increase working capacities at ultradilute concentrations of CO2. With the goal of increased capacities and reduced regeneration energies in mind, several groups have investigated the effects of amine loading, composition, and altering the silica support, with the general conclusion that a balance of several factors must be achieved to reach optimal values. Within this avenue of research, Jones and co-workers have also optimized a variety of materials in systematic fashion, reaching some of the highest CO2 capacities reported to date. They recently addressed a very fundamental and exciting, previously unexplored variable which showed extraordinary enhancements in CO2 uptake capacities, material stability, and desorption kinetics. They investigated the effects of acidity/basicity of the support by stoichiometrically incorporating Zr ions (0\u201314 mol%) into the SBA-15 support itself (Figure 1).

Tree architecture is thought to allow species to partition horizontal and vertical light gradients in the forest canopy. Tree architecture is closely related to light capture, carbon gain and the efficiency with which trees reach the canopy. Previous studies that investigated how light gradients drive differentiation in tree architecture have produced inconsistent results, partially because of the differences in which tree species and ontogenetic stages were studied. 2. We examined the relationship between stem diameter, tree height, foliage height, crown width and life-history strategy over a broad size range of 200 randomly selected, co-occurring tree species in a lowland rainforest in Peninsular Malaysia. We developed a hierarchical Bayesian model to account for both intra- and interspecific variation and describe the relationships among tree architectural variables. We analysed interspecific variation in tree architectural variables in relation to adult stature and light requirement for species regeneration as a function of tree size. 3. There was little interspecific variation in architectural variables, this is partly because of large intraspecific variation in response to canopy heterogeneity, but it also suggests architectural convergence within this community. However, interspecific analyses showed that, for large-statured species, small size classes had thinner stems with narrow and shallow crowns, whereas large-size classes had wider crowns. Light-demanding species (as indicated by high sapling mortality in shaded conditions) showed weak trends in tree architecture and were only characterized by wide crowns at intermediate sizes. 4. In summary, tree architectural traits overlapped across the species community. This suggests that architectural convergence and equalizing effects occur in this diverse tropical forest and that community-wide allometric equations can be used to describe forest height and carbon storage. Light resource partitioning also occurs, indicating stabilizing effects. Interspecific architectural variation in relation to adult stature supports the theory of the trade-off between early reproduction and vegetative growth. In closed rainforests, adult stature imposes a stronger force on architectural differentiation of species than regeneration light requirements.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "a8b98c18d42a9973b17277f7b3befa0f5a15e4b3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3023648477", "DOI": "10.3390/pr8050526", "CorpusId": 219067911}, "title": "Valorization of OFMSW Digestate-Derived Syngas toward Methanol, Hydrogen, or Electricity: Process Simulation and Carbon Footprint Calculation", "abstract": "This paper explores a possible waste-based economy transition strategy. Digestate from the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) is considered, as well as a low-added value product to be properly valorized. In this regard, air gasification may be used to produce syngas. In this work, the production of methanol, hydrogen, or electricity from digestate-derived syngas was assessed by ChemCAD process simulation software. The process scheme of methanol production comprises the following parts: water gas shift (WGS) with carbon capture and storage units (CCS), methanol synthesis, and methanol purification. In the case of hydrogen production, after WGS-CCS, hydrogen was purified from residual nitrogen by pressure swing absorption (PSA). Finally, for electricity production, the digestate-derived syngas was used as fuel in an internal combustion engine. The main objective of this work is to compare the proposed scenarios in terms of CO2 emission intensity and the effect of CO2 storage. In particular, CCS units were used for methanol or hydrogen production with the aim of obtaining high equilibrium yield toward these products. On the basis of 100 kt/year of digestate, results show that the global CO2 savings were 80, 71, and 69 ktCO2eq/year for electricity, methanol, and hydrogen production, respectively.

To achieve full underground dissolution of injected pure supercritical CO2 or gaseous CO2 may take thousands of years because of the absence of strong mixing (convective-diffusion dominated processes).

This yields an investor-dependent strategy for the deployment of new energy generation assets.

In the presentation, we increase the model\u2019s complexity stepwise, in order to depict the influences of various aspects, as for instance the interaction of technologies, value of waiting, or modification of an existing power plant portfolio. We find that including the value of waiting in the decision process not only delays the investment but also leads to an asymmetric risk distribution which features a much lower probability for losses. In addition, the results where the value of waiting is incorporated are more robust with respect to a variation of the investor\u2019s risk- and time-preferences compared to the results gained with the classical net present value model.

In this paper, we introduce a two\u2010stage optimization approach for modeling CCS infrastructure. We show how CO2 pipelines with discrete capacities can be \u2018linearized\u2019 without loss of information and accuracy, therefore allowing necessarily complex energy models to be solved. We demonstrate the new approach by designing a CCS network that collects large volumes of anthropogenic CO2 (up to 45 million tonnes of CO2 per year) from ethylene production facilities and delivers the CO2 to depleted oil fields to stimulate recovery through EOR. Utilization of anthropogenic CO2 has great potential to jumpstart commercial\u2010scale CCS while simultaneously reducing the carbon footprint of domestic oil production. Model outputs illustrate the engineering challenge and spatial extent of CCS infrastructure, as well as the costs (or profits) of deploying CCS technology.

This report describes the potential evolution of the CO2 transport network on the European scale for the period 2015-2050, in terms of physical size and capital cost requirements. These estimates have been made based on an innovative and sound methodology. The results however depend strongly on the assumptions that have been made, especially in view of the long-term horizon of the analysis, the uncertainty of CCS deployment rates and timelines, the lack of robust data on CO2 storage sites and the variability of pipeline construction costs. The size of the network grows steadily until 2030, to 8800 km, requiring around 9 billion euros of cumulative investment; followed by a step-change towards 2050, leading to a total investment of around 29 billion euros. This is based on a relatively conservative scenario of CCS deployment, as the amount of CO2 captured in 2050 does not meet the ambition for the decarbonisation of the European society by 2050. Scenarios compatible with the European vision for a decarbonised society by 2050, which will necessitate the capture of almost all CO2 emissions from both the power and the industrial sectors, would obviously be associated with a more extensive and hence more expensive CO2 transport network. By 2030, 16 EU Member States may be involved in crossborder CO2 transport. International coordination is therefore crucial for the development of an optimised transEuropean CO2 transport network.

We then reviewed the recent literature examining the impact of (a) land-based mitigation options and (b) land-based greenhouse gas removal options on biodiversity. We show that holding warming to 1.5\u00b0C versus 2\u00b0C can significantly reduce the number of species facing a potential loss of 50% of their climatic range. Further, there would be an increase of 5.5\u201314% of the globe that could potentially act as climatic refugia for plants and animals, an area equivalent to the current global protected area network.

For impacts of land-based greenhouse gas removal technologies on biodiversity, some (e.g. soil carbon sequestration) could be neutral or positive, others (e.g. bioenergy with carbon capture and storage) are likely to lead to conflicts, while still others (e.g. afforestation/reforestation) are context-specific, when applied at scales necessary for meaningful greenhouse gas removal.

Given the nascence of CCS technology, with only eight large-scale integrated projects in the world (Global CCS Institute 2010), significant challenges still must be overcome for large-scale deployment, such as addressing technical issues of integration and scale-up, legal and regulatory requirements to reduce investor risk, policies to create market drivers and mitigate economic impacts, including increases in electricity prices, and financing mechanisms to facilitate investment in the technology. This report does not provide prescriptive solutions to overcome these barriers, since action must be taken on a country-by-country basis, taking account of different circumstances and national policies. Individual governments should decide their priorities on climate change mitigation and adopt appropriate measures accordingly. The analyses presented in this report may take on added relevance, depending on the future direction of international climate negotiations and domestic legal and policy measures, and how they serve to encourage carbon sequestration. Both international and domestic actions can further incentivize the deployment of CCS and its inclusion in project development. Incentives to promote CCS include adopting climate change policies that could provide revenues for CCS projects, but it is likely that a combination of domestic and international mechanisms will be required, alongside carbon revenues, to kick-start CCS project development and reduce investor risk in developing countries in particular. This report assesses some of the most important barriers facing CCS deployment within the context of developing and transition economies.

Here, we contrast insights from these reports with other recent literature and demonstrate that BECCS bears additional risks for biodiversity, livelihoods, and intertemporal carbon balances. We point out that the majority of scenarios that meet the goals of the Paris agreements exceed sustainability and precautionary thresholds in land and BECCS potentials. Risks may be best avoided by demandsidedriven rapid decarbonization and less landintensive carbon dioxide removal technologies. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage features prominently in many climate stabilization scenarios, and is envisaged as a feature of energy sector and landbased mitigation (Roe et al., 2019; Rogelj et al., 2018). The IPCC Special Report \u201cGlobal Warming of 1.5\u00b0C\u201d (SR1.5) presents BECCS in three of four illustrative pathways as essential for realizing mitigation targets (Table 1, IPCC, 2018). Compensating for past and present GHG emissions, BECCS is modeled to deliver up to about 20 Gt CO2 sequestration per year, requiring several million square km of land (Table 1, IPCC, 2018). Surprisingly, even a scenario framed as \u201csustainable\u201d (P2 in Table 1) relies strongly on BECCS and associated land demand of nearly 1 Mkm2 (1 Mkm2 = 1 million square kilometers = 1012 m2 = 100 Mha). In scenarios where societies reduce GHG emissions rapidly, and reduce demand for energy and GHG emissionintensive goods (P1 in Table 1), BECCS is not required (Grubler et al., 2018).

In addition to efficiency improvements, reduction of energy consumption, and the utilization of renewable energy sources, the application of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies seems to be unavoidable. Whereas all these measures aim on the reduction of CO 2 that is being newly released, there is the approach to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere that has already been emitted. This can be achieved by the utilization of bioenergy in CCS processes. Within this paper, the utilization of alternative fuels in two second-generation CCS processes is assessed. In this regard, chemical looping combustion (CLC) and calcium looping (CaL) are two promising technologies. Both processes have proven their feasibility already in semi-industrial scale. The assessment includes three different types of fuel namely coal, biomass, and solid recovered fuel (SRF). The analysis is twofold: first, a heat and mass balance calculation reveals the specific CO 2 emissions of each power system; second, a cost analysis points out the feasibility from an economic point of view. The highest CO 2 removal can be achieved by a biomass-fired CLC unit (\u2212\u2009696\u00a0g CO2 /kWh e ). Furthermore, it was found that the co-combustion of SRF even at moderate co-firing rates allows for noteworthy improved economics of the CCS system. Therefore, the utilization of waste-derived fuels in the context of CCS processes should be put more into focus in future research activities.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "b859967ea7143b41d9216472f275b04697bc1e17", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2308426358", "DOI": "10.1007/s11069-015-2135-6", "CorpusId": 131050863}, "title": "Coupling analysis of China\u2019s urbanization and carbon emissions: example from Hubei Province", "abstract": "Urbanization is a process of human production and lifestyle reform as the social productive forces reach a certain level. There is a very tight coupling relationship between urbanization and energy consumption as well as carbon emissions, e.g., mutual promotion or mutual restraint. Taking Hubei Province as an example, comparative analyses between urbanization and energy consumption as well as carbon emissions are conducted based on the data from 1990 to 2012; they can be observed roughly that the overall trend is basically consistent; and in recent years, after 2000, they all show rapid growth, indicating the strong correlation. In addition, the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method is applied to decompose the change in carbon emissions into some influencing factors caused by urbanization. The decomposition results show that economic development has the greatest positive effect on carbon emissions, and energy intensity contributes largely to carbon emission reduction; the contribution of energy mix and gross population is not absolute and obvious due to the small change during the period of 1990\u20132012. To harmonize the development of urbanization with low carbon emissions, the energy development pattern and carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) strategy are proposed for Hubei Province. In the short term, new energy and renewable energy should be explored and developed, such as nuclear power and biomass, whereas for long-term interests, the development of CCUS will be a significant choice in the process of urbanization and industrialization.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "69a07f7dd901009c9f1445fc1d0ac58d425621e6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2133321830", "DOI": "10.1306/13171230ST59227", "CorpusId": 55708948}, "title": "Geological Input to Selection and Evaluation of CO2 Geosequestration Sites", "abstract": "Coal, oil, and natural gas currently supply about 85% of the world's energy needs. Unfortunately, the burning of these fossil fuels is the major source of anthropogenic carbon dioxide, which is also the main greenhouse gas released to the atmosphere. One promising means by which to reduce CO2 emissions, and so the atmospheric buildup of CO2, is geosequestration. Geosequestration, also known as carbon capture and storage (CCS), involves the long-term storage of CO2 in deep subsurface geological reservoirs. Geosequestration comprises several steps that include the capture of CO2, the transport of CO2, the injection of CO2 into suitable reservoirs, and finally, the storage and monitoring of the CO2 that has been introduced into the reservoir. Geological input into the evaluation of storage sites, including injection, storage, and monitoring and verification of volumes and movement of CO2 plumes, is critical for acceptance of CCS technologies. Detailed characterization and realistic modeling of reservoir and seal properties, as well as of rock and fault integrity, will permit a more viable analysis of risks associated with the subsurface containment of injected CO2. Geosequestration can be a significant factor in the portfolio of CO2 emissions reduction strategies because by reducing CO2 emissions while still allowing for the continued use of fossil fuels, geosequestration buys time for the transition to renewable energy sources.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "5d6da5f7b5b152b09791f5ef218a8c5df88a8b74", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2982447626", "DOI": "10.1007/s10098-019-01774-1", "CorpusId": 204971176}, "title": "Modeling and performance analysis of subcritical and supercritical coal-fired power plants with biomass co-firing and CO2 capture", "abstract": "Coal-fired power plants are the largest source of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into the atmosphere, and these emissions can be effectively reduced by improving the efficiency of the plants, co-firing sustainably grown biomass and applying carbon capture and storage technologies. In this study, the energy and environmental performances of both subcritical (SubC) and supercritical (SC) pulverized coal-fired power plants with biomass co-firing and integrated with an advanced amine-based postcombustion CO2 capture system were evaluated and compared. The impact of biomass (hybrid poplar) addition was investigated at different co-firing ratios varying up to 30% on a heat input basis. All plant configurations were modeled and simulated with Aspen Plus process simulation software. The results show that the use of a SC steam cycle has a positive impact on the energy and environmental performance of the investigated plants, improving the efficiency by 2.4% points and reducing the total fuel consumption and CO2 emissions by 6% in comparison to those of the SubC cases. Biomass co-firing has a negative impact on the energy performance of plants while significantly reducing fossil-based carbon emissions. The reduction of net CO2 emissions is almost proportional to the biomass percentage in the feed. At 30% biomass co-firing, the net plant efficiency is reduced by approx. 1% point, while the net CO2 emissions are 28% lower than those in coal-fired only plants. The introduction of CO2 capture has a major impact both on the emissions generated and on the energy efficiency. Depending on the plant type and co-firing ratio used, the net plant efficiencies are 8.7\u20139.3% points lower than those of non-capture cases. The net CO2 emissions achieve negative values when carbon is captured from the biomass co-firing plants.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "48493a6c5faf0bfd94a3c64199b440278b258ffb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2262800535", "CorpusId": 112221174}, "title": "CO2-capture and geological storage as a climate policy option: Technologies, concepts, perspectives", "abstract": "The idea of removing carbon dioxide from flue gas and industrial gas flows and putting it into suitable long-term storage sites is referred to as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). This publication provides a close look at this new line of technologies, describing its current status and outlining the prospects for development. The approach is both diagnostic and analytical, identifying the questions a technology assessment poses and showing the steps that need to be taken to implement CCS. CCS is currently moving to the centre of climate policy discussion. Nonetheless this line of technologies is still the subject of controversial discussion. On the one hand there is a clear hope that these technologies will open up opportunities to use fossil fuels without harming the climate and thus make it possible to continue using oil, natural gas and above all coal even under a stricter climate regime. Accordingly, numerous R&D projects have been initiated all over the world, and various demonstration projects are at the planning or implementation stage. On the other hand, CCS (especially the storage part) has given rise to considerable scepticism from an ecological point of view.", "year": 2007}]}
