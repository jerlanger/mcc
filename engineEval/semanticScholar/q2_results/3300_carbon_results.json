Under climate change, its phenology is presumed to be changing and mass infestations becoming more likely. While several studies have investigated climate effects across a latitudinal gradient, it remains an open question how phenology will change depending on elevation and topology. Knowing how an altered climate is likely to affect bark beetle populations, particularly across diverse topographies and elevations, is essential for adaptive management. We developed a time\u2010varying distributed delay model to predict the phenology of I. typographus. This approach has the particular advantage of capturing the variability within populations and thus representing its stage structure at any time. The model is applied for three regional climate change scenarios, A1B, A2 and RCP3PD, to the diverse topography of Switzerland, covering a large range of elevations, aspects and slopes. We found a strong negative relationship between voltinism and elevation. Under climate change, the model predicts an increasing number of generations over the whole elevational gradient, which will be more pronounced at low elevations. In contrast, the pre\u2010shift in spring swarming is expected to be greater at higher elevations. In comparison, the general trend of faster beetle development on steep southern slopes is only of minor importance. Overall, the maximum elevation allowing a complete yearly generation will move upwards. Generally, the predicted increase in number of generations, earlier spring swarming, more aggregated swarming, together with a projected increase in drought and storm events, will result in a higher risk of mass infestations. This will increase the pressure on spruce stands particularly in the lowlands and require intensified management efforts.

In order to contribute the advancement of CO2 geological sequestration and its multiphase flow analysis, a coreflood experiment using carbon dioxide and brine on the carbonate rock is conducted with in-situ saturation monitoring by Xray Computed Tomography (CT). CO2 saturated brine is used in one of the experimental processes to avoid the dissolution of carbon dioxide into the brine. It is important to measure the trapped CO2 saturation to estimate the amount of CO2 residual trapping in the rock. The experimental result clearly shows the relationship between rock heterogeneity and residual CO2 saturation even in the same rock sample as the injected CO2 flows through more porous area and it is trapped at lower porosity area. Residual CO2 saturation by capillary trapping is observed on the Middle Eastern carbonate rock. The study also gives us the insight for the CO2-EOR with enhancing recovery and simultaneously storing CO2 by capillary mechanism. In-situ saturation monitoring is the key to understand fluid movement and trapping. The relationships among porosity, saturation and flow rate are discussed based on the experiment and the analysis. INTRODUCTION CO2 atmospheric emissions by human activity are considered to be one of the causes of global warming as the CO2 is one of greenhouse gase. The increase of CO2 emission affects global carbon cycle and it seems to relate recent unusual climate conditions. Therefore, to limit and reduce CO2 emission is necessary, but it is a challenge as the primary source for the emission is energy use. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) published a special report on carbon dioxide capture and storage (IPCC, 2005) and it refers CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is one of technical options to reduce greenhouse gas from atmosphere.

How to design a suitable carbon tax rate is of significance for policy makers. This study aims to address this issue from a microeconomic perspective by exploring the decision behavior of a potential investor. A trinomial tree model based on real options theory is presented to evaluate carbon capture and storage (CCS) investment in coal\u2010fired power plants considering uncertain factors. The model is then applied to a case study and the main findings are as follows: (1) carbon tax policy will have a positive effect on the CCS investment. If the carbon price is not high enough to trigger CCS investment, a hybrid mechanism integrating carbon trading and carbon tax to stimulate CCS investment is required; (2) in applying the trinomial tree real options model, the optimal carbon tax rate should be 145.3 RMB/ton for supercritical pulverized coal (SCPC) (or 79.54 RMB/ton for integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)) plants under current market condition and at current technological levels; (3) the optimal carbon tax rate is sensitive to uncertainties. Specifically, the optimal tax rate depends largely on not only the cost of the CCS investment but also the portfolio of carbon price volatility and the initial carbon price level.

Crystalline porous materials are a promising class of materials that can be used for oil refinement, hydrogen or methane storage as well as carbon dioxide capture. Selecting optimal materials for these important applications requires analysis and screening of millions of potential candidates. Recently, we proposed an automatic approach based on the Fast Marching Method (FMM) for performing analysis of void space inside materials, a critical step preceding expensive molecular dynamics simulations. This breakthrough enables unsupervised, high-throughput characterization of large material databases. The algorithm has three steps: (1) calculation of the cost-grid which represents the structure and encodes the occupiable positions within the void space; (2) using FMM to segment out patches of the void space in the grid of (1), and find how they are connected to form either periodic channels or inaccessible pockets; and (3) generating blocking spheres that encapsulate the discovered inaccessible pockets and are used in proceeding molecular simulations. In this work, we expand upon our original approach through (A) replacement of the FMM-based approach with a more computationally efficient flood fill algorithm; and (B) parallelization of all steps in the algorithm, including a GPU implementation of the most computationally expensive step, the cost-grid generation.

Since its discovery, CNT has been intensively studied due to its remarkable electrical, mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties (Iijima, 1991; Katz & Willner, 2004). Based on the structures and dimensions, CNTs can be divided into two groups: single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs). An SWNT is one tube of graphene capped at both ends and it consists of only surface carbon atoms; its diameter is in the range of 1-2 nm. An MWNT is composed of multiple coaxial tubes of SWNTs and its diameter is often in the range of 10-150 nm. CNTs have a high potential in a broad range of applications, especially in nanoelectronics and biomedical sensors. A wide variety of electronic devices based on individual CNTs or CNT thin films have been developed and used as sensors (Boul et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2009; Xue & Cui, 2008b), field-effect transistors (Xue & Cui, 2009; Xue et al., 2006), conductive interconnects (Robertson et al., 2008; Xue & Cui, 2008a), and energy storage systems (Hu et al., 2009; Kaempgen et al., 2009). A critical step to obtain these practical devices is to deposit well-organized and highly aligned CNTs in desired locations. Recently, researchers have developed a number of methods to align CNTs: using moving fluids to organize nanotubes (S. Li et al., 2007), introducing gas flows in reactors or channels (Liu et al., 2009), withdrawing microfluidic channels from solutions (Tsukruk et al., 2004), spin coating nanotube dispersions with controlled speeds (LeMieux et al., 2008; Roberts et al., 2009), and magnetic capturing of nanotubes (Shim et al., 2009). However, many of these techniques have limitations and restrictions because they require either intensive preparation processes or assisting materials with special properties. Therefore, their applications are relatively limited. By comparison, dielectrophoresis, a simple but versatile method, has proven to be effective in aligning CNTs in small and large scales (Gultepe et al., 2008; Mureau et al., 2006). This method can be conducted at room temperature with low voltages. In addition, a number of parameters such as solution concentration, deposition time, alternating current (AC) amplitude, and frequency can be adjusted to optimize the quality of the aligned CNTs. More importantly, dielectrophoresis can be easily incorporated into device fabrication and has the potential to be used in wafer-level deposition for the mass production of CNT-based devices (Monica et al., 2008; Stokes & Khondaker, 2008; Xiao & Camino, 2009).", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "c2496c6ac6c44e811e5709cd9c152a3498917c54", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2135859366", "DOI": "10.1115/GT2011-45459", "CorpusId": 97986468}, "title": "Combustion Characteristics of a Multiple-Injection Combustor for Dry Low-NOx Combustion of Hydrogen-Rich Fuels Under Medium Pressure", "abstract": "An oxygen-blown integrated coal gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plant with pre-combustion carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is one of the most promising means of zero-emission generation of power from coal. In an IGCC plant with CCS, hydrogen-rich syngas with a wide variation of hydrogen contents is supplied to a gas turbine. Such hydrogen-rich syngas poses a great challenge to a low NOx combustor based on premixed combustion technology, because its high flame speed, low ignition energy, and broad flammability limits can cause flashback and / or auto-ignition. On the other hand, a diffusion combustor suffers from the high flame temperature of syngas and the resulting high NOx emission. The authors applied a \u201cmulti-injection burner\u201d (cluster burner) concept to a preliminary burner for hydrogen-rich syngas simulating that from IGCC with CCS. In a preliminary experiment under atmospheric pressure, the multi-injection burner worked without any flashback or any blowout. A prototype multi-cluster combustor based on the results of that preliminary study was made to be a dry low NOx combustor for hydrogen-rich syngas of IGCC with CCS. It was tested in experiments, which were carried out under medium pressure (0.6MPa) using test fuels simulating syngas from IGCC with a 0% carbon capture rate, a 30% carbon capture rate and a 50% carbon capture rate. The test fuels contained hydrogen, methane and nitrogen, and had hydrogen content ranging from 40% to 65%. The following conclusions were drawn from the test results: (1) The tested combustor allows stable combustion of fuels simulating 0%, 30%, and 50% CCS.

An eight step VPSA cycle is tested in a two-column lab-pilot for a ternary CO2\u2013H2\u2013CH4 stream representative of shifted steam methane reformer (SMR) syngas, while using commercial zeolite 13X as adsorbent.

The key decision variables for adjusting the separation performance to reach the required targets are the heavy purge (HP) duration, the feed duration, the evacuation pressure and the flow rate of the light purge (LP). In contrast to that, the separation performance is rather insensitive towards small changes in feed composition and in HP inlet composition. Comparing the experimental results with simulation results shows that the model for describing multi-component adsorption is critical in determining the predictive capabilities of the column model.

These challenges are traditionally addressed independently at the grid-level, leading to conservative costs and limited operational flexibility for both systems. Here, we examine the synergistic integration of renewables and flexible carbon capture with individual fossil power plants. Renewables provide clean energy for carbon capture, while flexible carbon capture acts as a form of energy storage to counter renewable intermittency. To assess whether the benefits obtained from integration outweigh the capital cost under spatiotemporal variability of electricity markets and renewable energy, we develop a mathematical programming-based optimization framework. We decouple the design and operational decisions in a two-stage optimization strategy to efficiently solve the large-scale problem. When applied to a nationwide case study on coal plants across the US, we observe that, for futuristic carbon tax and renewable cost scenarios, it is profitable to invest in solar-assisted carbon capture for nearly one-third of the coal plants. It reduces carbon capture cost by 8.9%, and accommodates solar intermittency while avoiding the capital cost of an equivalent battery, which is 4.4 times the solar farm cost. Furthermore, the levelized cost of electricity will be less than that of new natural gas plants with overall emission reduction between 87.5 and 91%.

The resulted median toxic effect pH ranged from 6.33\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 and 6.91\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 for the egg fertilisation, and between 6.66\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 and 7.16\u2009\u00b1\u20090.01 for the larval development assays. Concentrations of Co, Zn, As, Cu, and Fe were detected in the sediment elutriates. For all the sediment elutriates tested the amount of the dissolved Zn increased in parallel with the pH reductions. Correlated effects of acidification, biological response, and the presence of dissolved metals were observed in this work evidencing that the most important factor controlling the reduction of egg fertilisation and larval development success was the combined effects of the reduction of pH and the presence of the contaminants (mainly Zn, Co, and As).", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "324ff722db46e674cc244ba805189543a148fa54", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2186310587", "CorpusId": 110976821}, "title": "Advanced Membrane Reactors in IGCC: H 2 or CO 2 separation?", "abstract": "Abstract This paper presents the results of preliminary system assessments that were conducted in order to pursue optimum operating conditions for advanced separation enhanced water-gas-shift membrane reactors. The project is entitled: \u201cAdvanced Membrane Reactors in Energy Systems\u201d and appertains to the Global Climate & Energy Project (GCEP), which is coordinated by Stanford University. The implementation of hydrogen- and carbon dioxide-selective water-gas-shift membrane reactors in Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles was optimized with exergy analyses and compared with respect to efficiency penalties. The optimization resulted in optimum operating conditions,which serves the selection of a designated material for the development of advanced carbon dioxide-selective membrane reactors. Introduction Carbon capture and storage is widely recognized as the designated pathway towards sustainable application of fossil fuels. However, the efficiency penalty induced by carbon capture within energy conversion systems poses a threat to the economic viability of these systems. An opportunity lies in the integration of various unit operations, which reduces the efficiency penalty and consequently enhances the outlook for commercial application.In advanced membrane reactors fuel conversion reactions such as reforming or the water-gas-shift reactions are combined with separation of one of the reaction products. Thus the fuel chemical equilibrium is shifted and conversion is increased significantly. The equilibrium shift results in reduced thermodynamic losses, when compared with conventional unit operations.The use of coal for electric power generation by Integrated Gasification Combined Cycles (IGCC) regained interest upon the recent increase of oil and natural gas prices. The ample availability of coal which is secured for a number of centuries and its more homogeneous distribution across the globe, compared to oil and natural gas are the main factors. IGCC will play a predominant part for electricity generation in the near future. This coal conversion technology is cleaner and more efficient compared to pulverized coal boilers. Its main disadvantage remains the CO", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "0729de3d05deac2671692fba74f9cd2d0fe2c6bf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2234140700", "CorpusId": 167368393}, "title": "European Electricity Generation Post-2020: Renewable Energy Not To Be Underestimated", "abstract": "In its Green Paper on a 2030 framework for climate and energy policies, the European Commission calls for a framework for the future development of environment and energy policy beyond 2020.

The European Commission would need to provide updated model calculations rapidly to enable energy policy decisions to be taken on the basis of transparent and comprehensible scenarios. A comparison of recent estimates conducted by DIW Berlin indicates that the Commission systematically underestimates the cost of nuclear power and carbon capture, transport, and storage (CCTS), while the cost of renewables tends to be overestimated. In particular this applies to photovoltaics where current capital costs are, to a certain extent, already lower than the Commission's estimates for 2050. In contrast to renewables, neither nuclear energy nor carbon capture, transport, and storage are cost efficient enough to play a central role in the future European electricity mix.

During the growing season of 2011, from a field survey and household questionnaires, the main impacts of dung collection for fuel on the C cycle of the ecosystem were identified. (1) The C sequestration and storage capacity, including the dung-derived C stored in soil and C captured by vegetation, decreased. The net primary production decreased remarkably because of the reduction of dung returned to soil. (2) In a given period, more C was emitted to the atmosphere in the dung combustion situation than that in the dung returned to soil situation. (3) The energy grazing alpine meadow ecosystem changed into a net C source, and the net biome production of the ecosystem dropped to \u221215.18\u00a0g\u00a0C/m2\u00a0year in the dung combustion situation, 42.95\u00a0g\u00a0C/m2\u00a0year less than that in the dung returned situation.

Attention has been drawn toward utilization of nanosize-based oxygen carrier for bulk application. CLC is a novel technology for combustion of fossil fuels that avoids dilution of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) with flue gases. Performance of CLC system depends upon redox reactivity and stability of oxygen carrier particles at high operating temperature.

Screened dairy manure containing 3.5% volatile solids (VS) was either anaerobically digested or aerobically treated prior to storage in air-tight vessels. Anaerobic digestion was carried out using a mesophilic anaerobic sequencing batch reactor operated at a hydraulic retention time of 20 days and an organic loading rate (OLR) of 1 gVS/L/day. Aerobic treatment was achieved using an aerobic reactor operated at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10 days and an OLR of 2 gVS/(L\u00b7d). The treated manure was put into the storage on a daily basis for a period of 180 days. All the gases produced during this period were captured and analyzed for methane, carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Untreated manure was stored and analyzed in the same way as the treated manure and used as a control for comparison. The results show that low amounts of gases were produced during the first 84 days of storage in both treated and untreated manure, but increased significantly after this time point. The generally expected positive impacts of anaerobic and aerobic treatment on the reductions of methane and VOCs were confirmed in this study. However, the effects of anaerobic and aerobic treatment varied over the time of storage, especially for VOCs. The results of this study indicate that to achieve significant reductions in VOC emission the storage time of anaerobic digester or aerobic reactor effluent should be limited to no more than 100 days.

Therefore, aim of this research was to analyze the mechanical behaviour of cement cured in saline water. Testings such as uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) test, X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were conducted or well cement cured in different NaCl brine concentrations (0- 30%) with various curing periods (7- 45 days). Based on the experimental outcome, it was observed that the strength and the Young modulus of OPC based well cement decreases with salinity levels and with ageing in time. Moreover, SEM test results showed that the NaCl penetration and deposition into the samples is high at higher salinity levels and longer ageing periods.

A correct estimation of the frictional pressure-drop is an important part of such a model. A homogenous friction-model, the Friedel model, and the Cheng et al. model have been compared with six steady-state experiments using pure CO2. The experiments were nearly adiabatic and within the following range: mass velocities from 1058 to 1663 kg/m2s, saturated temperatures from 3.8 to 17 C (reduced pressures from 0.52 to 0.72), vapor fractions from 0.099 to 0.742, and pipe diameter of 10 mm. The Friedel model was found to be the most accurate model with a standard deviation of 9.7 % versus 55.74 % for the Cheng et al. model and 29.18 % for the homogenous model. The selected friction models were implemented into a numerical model for pipe flow of multiphase CO2, and one of the mentioned experiments was reproduced. The result illustrates how the accuracy of the friction model is even more important when used as a part of the complete transport-model. This is mainly because the friction model and other sub-models, such as the equation of state, are coupled. During the implementation of the Cheng et al. model, certain errors in the original paper were found and corrected. In the case of a transient flow, the influence of the friction model and the associated slip relation, were explored. It was shown that wave speeds strongly depends on the slip relation used. The friction model itself will indirectly affect the wave speed. This is mainly because of the reduced fluid velocity arising when the driving force across the wave is reduced.

Among other options, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is being considered as a potential technology for decarbonising the power sector. Consequently, it is important to quantify the relative benefits and trade-offs of coal-CCS in comparison to its competing renewable power sources from multiple sustainability perspectives. In this paper, we assess coal-CCS pathways in India up to 2050 and compare coal-CCS with conventional coal, solar PV and wind power sources through an integrated assessment approach coupled with a nexus perspective (energy-cost-climate-water nexus). Our levelized costs assessment reveals that coal-CCS is expensive and significant cost reductions would be needed for CCS to compete in the Indian power market. In addition, although carbon pricing could make coal-CCS competitive in relation to conventional coal power plants, it cannot influence the lack of competitiveness of coal-CCS with respect to renewables. From a climate perspective, CCS can significantly reduce the life cycle GHG emissions of conventional coal power plants, but renewables are better positioned than coal-CCS if the goal is ambitious climate change mitigation. Our water footprint assessment reveals that coal-CCS consumes an enormous volume of water resources in comparison to conventional coal and, in particular, to renewables. To conclude, our findings highlight that coal-CCS not only suffers from typical new technology development related challenges\u2014such as a lack of technical potential assessments and necessary support infrastructure, and high costs\u2014but also from severe resource constraints (especially water) in an era of global warming and the competition from outperforming renewable power sources.

This has encouraged the contemplation of their use in applications such as increasing the storage capacity in natural gas fuel tanks, or the capture of carbon dioxide from coal-fired flue gas streams. However, while the gas adsorption capacity of MOFs is large, not all stored gas can be readily released to realize the efficient regeneration of MOF adsorbents. This leads to an increase in energy requirements, or working capacities significantly lower than the amount of gas adsorbed. This requirement for low energy means to efficiently release more stored gas has motivated the research in our group toward the triggered release of the stored gas from MOFs. Using CO2 as a typical gas adsorbate, we have developed three new methods of releasing stored gas with external stimuli that include light induction swing adsorption, magnetic induction swing adsorption, and their combination, denoted as LISA, MISA and MaLISA, respectively. LISA: Light, being naturally abundant, is particularly interesting for reducing the parasitic energy load on coal-fired power stations for regenerating the CO2 adsorbent. We showed that, by incorporating light-responsive organic linkers, exposure of light to a gas-loaded MOF promoted localized movement in the linkers, expelling around 80% of the adsorbed gas, just from the use of concentrated sunlight. Variation of the light-responsive components such as silver nanoparticles in MOFs allowed the response to be moved from UV to visible wavelengths, improving safety and light penetration depth. MISA: In order to expand this discovery to larger scales, more penetrating forms of radiation were sought. MOFs incorporated with magnetic nanoparticles (Magnetic Framework Composites, MFCs) were developed, and absorb the alternating magnetic fields exceptionally efficiently. The rapid heating of magnetic particles delivers local temperature increases to the otherwise thermally insulating MOF material, and in optimized conditions release all adsorbed gas in a matter of minutes. MaLISA: The triggered release methods of LISA and MISA may be combined in MFCs that also contain light-responsive groups. Both stimuli were employed and cooperative enhancement of gas releasing efficiency were found, minimizing the overall energy requirement even further. Initial calculations of the energy costs for these processes have shown them to have the potential to exceed any other reported method, following optimization. Encouragingly, the efficiency of the process was found to increase at larger scales, prompting further research in this area toward widespread deployment.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "f21ef63a7de30fc53ce4a6256b40fa8fb5305d8d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2608689617", "DOI": "10.1080/00018732.2017.1317963", "CorpusId": 125738447}, "title": "Electron-volt neutron spectroscopy: beyond fundamental systems", "abstract": "This work provides an up-to-date account of the use of electron-volt neutron spectroscopy in materials research.

These include: hydrides and proton conductors for energy applications; protons, deuterons, and oxygen atoms in bulk water; aqueous protons confined in nanoporous silicas, carbon nanotubes, and graphene-related materials; hydrated water in proteins and DNA; and the uptake of molecular hydrogen by soft nanostructured media, promising materials for energy-storage applications.

Its use in agriculture includes animal feeding, manure treatment (e.g. as additive for bedding, composting, storage or anaerobic digestion), fertilizer component or direct soil application. Because the feedstock carbon is photosynthetically fixed CO2 from the atmosphere, producing and applying biochar is essentially a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technology, which has a high\u2010technology readiness level.

Agronomic biochar research is a rapidly evolving field of research moving from less than 100 publications in 2010 to more than 15,000 by the end of 2020. Here, we summarize 26 rigorously selected meta\u2010analyses published since 2016 that investigated a multitude of soil properties and agronomic performance parameters impacted by biochar application, for example, effects on yield, root biomass, water use efficiency, microbial activity, soil organic carbon and greenhouse gas emissions. All 26 meta\u2010analyses show compelling evidence of the overall beneficial effect of biochar for all investigated agronomic parameters. One of the remaining challenges is the standardization of basic biochar analysis, still lacking in many studies. Incomplete biochar characterization increases uncertainty because adverse effects of individual studies included in the meta\u2010analyses might be related to low\u2010quality biochars, which would not qualify for certification and subsequent use (e.g. high content of contaminants, high salinity, incomplete pyrolysis, etc.).

Considering multiple uncertainties, which include carbon trading price volatility, carbon utilization revenue fluctuation, and changes in carbon transport and storage cost, the least squares Monte Carlo simulation method is used to solve the problems of path dependence. The research results show that the independent effects of carbon trading mechanisms on investment stimulation and emission reduction are limited. The utilization ratio of captured CO2 has significant impacts on the net present value and investment value of the CCUS project. Moreover, the investment threshold is highly sensitive to the utilization proportion of food grade CO2 with high purity.

Supercritical or gaseous CO2 dissolves in the pore aqueous solution as a function of the pressure, temperature, and salinity conditions. This process changes the local chemistry; in that it significantly decreases the pH and promotes geochemical reactions such as the dissolution of primary minerals and precipitation of secondary phases. These reactions then alter the porous network and can have a significant feedback on the migration of fluids (water and gas) in the reservoir. In addition, the dissolution of CO2 in the aqueous phase changes the overall composition of both fluids, thus impacting the gravitational and viscous forces, as well as the motion of both phases. The importance of multiphase flow and reactive transport is thus critical to carbon capture and storage (CCS), and moreover, it is necessary for CCS operators to consider these induced chemical and physical processes in predictive simulations, thus ensuring that CO2 does not leak into surrounding aquifers or the reservoir surface. Hence, accurate numerical multiphase flow and reactive transport modeling approaches are of paramount importance. Reactive transport simulations provide a unique means of quantitative and proper consideration of the coupling between the gas migration and its interactions with the pore water, in conjunction with the reactivity of the porous host rock (Garcia 2003; Ennis-King and Paterson 2005; Lu and Lichtner 2005; Nordbotten et al. 2005; Le Gallo et al. 2006; Trenty et al. 2006; Hassanzadeh et al. 2007; Pruess and Spycher 2007; Gaus et al. 2008; Nordbotten et al. 2008; Goerke et al. 2011; Sin 2015; Sin et al. 2017b).

Fortunately, renewable energy mitigates this problem by making up 20% of human energy needs. However, from a \u201cgreen environment\u201d perspective, can carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere be reduced and eliminated? The carbon economic circle is an ideal solution to this problem, as it enables us to store, use, and remove carbon dioxide. This research introduces the circular carbon economy (CCE) and addresses its economic importance. Additionally, the paper discusses carbon capture and storage (CCS), and the utilisation of CO2. Furthermore, it explains current technologies and their future applications on environmental impact, CO2 capture, utilisation, and storage (CCUS). Various opinions on the best way to achieve zero carbon emissions and on CO2 applications and their economic impact are also discussed. The circular carbon economy can be achieved through a highly transparent global administration that is supportive of advanced technologies that contribute to the efficient utilisation of energy sources. This global administration must also provide facilities to modernise and develop factories and power stations, based on emission-reducing technologies. Monitoring emissions in countries through a global monitoring network system, based on actual field measurements, linked to a worldwide database allows all stakeholders to track the change in greenhouse gas emissions. The process of sequestering carbon dioxide in the ocean is affected by the support for technologies and industries that adopt the principle of carbon recycling in order to maintain the balance. This includes supporting initiatives that contribute to increasing vegetation cover and preserving oceans from pollutants, especially chemicals and radioactive pollutants, which will undoubtedly affect the process of sequestering carbon dioxide in the oceans, and this will contribute significantly to maintaining carbon dioxide at acceptable levels.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "f705573fe4ff1002d0e7543ee59c54e353290863", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1583960522", "CorpusId": 128582309}, "title": "Colonising the future : the case of carbon capture and storage", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has rapidly emerged as a crucial technological option for decarbonising electricity supply and hence mitigating climate change.

Andean montane forests are currently a major global conservation priority owing to their high species richness and high level of endemism. Nonetheless they are considered one of the least known ecosystems in the tropics, but the breath of ecosystem services that these forests provide, including the regulation of regional climate and the capture and storage of carbon, is widely recognised. This article presents an overview of the conservation status of tropical Andean montane forests and the challenges it entails.

However, injected CO2 in deep formation has potential to leak into a shallow aquifer. Thus, although it is challenging, development of detection technologies in a shallow aquifer region is essential to assure the long term safety of a CCS project. Recently, field scale experiments were carried out around the world to identify CO2 leakage and to investigate effects on groundwater quality in shallow aquifers. From the literature, 8 controlled CO2 release test sites and 9 experimental cases were identified. In those sites, CO2 was artificially injected around the shallow aquifer region as CO2-infused groundwater phase or gas phase for identifying environmental effects caused by CO2 injection. This paper reviews the hydraulic heterogeneity, mineral compositions, monitoring systems, and environmental parameters required for leakage detection at each site. For constructing a controlled test bed, inclined wells, horizontal wells, and multiple injection wells were identified as reliable injection components. It was also identified that the injected CO2 migration and its effects were monitored through the constructed monitoring networks. The previous operation cases show that continuous monitoring of pH, electrical conductivity (EC), Ca and Mg concentrations is the most basic and important factor for leakage detection. Trace elements and isotopes were also widely used to determine the CO2 leakage. The Korea CO2 Storage Environmental Management (K-COSEM) research center is going to construct an environmental impact test (EIT) facility for developing CO2 leakage detection methods in a shallow aquifer region in Korea. The challenging issues will include the fate and transport of CO2 from the fractured zone to the saturated zone and to the unsaturated soil.

The Governance of Innovations in the Energy Sector: Between Adaptation and Exploration", "abstract": "The field of electricity supply has slowly evolved over a long period of time. Electricity supply constitutes an example of a large technical system resistant to sudden changes or reorientations. The essential incentives for changes have come from the so called oil-price shocks in the mid ninety-seventies of the last century, the Chernobyl accident and the resulting critical attitude towards nuclear energy in many countries, the liberalization of markets driven forward by the European Commission, discussions about climate change and finally the Fukushima catastrophe. Such external events can lead to changes in governance structures. The standard operating procedure is to have the incumbent actors deal with external challenges in the established way of doing things (structures and actors). We assume that changes in the governance structure are not an immediate reaction to external shocks, but rather these external shocks have to be interpreted, mediated by new, skilled actors and perceived as a chance to see things differently and organize and build coalitions around these new frames. For a successful transformation, a change in the relevant power constellations which supports the incumbent governance structure is required. Processes of change in the end deal with the following question: which actors can achieve what aims under what conditions?

The new globally available digital elevation model (DEM) of the spaceborne TanDEM-X mission has an unprecedented spatial resolution (12 \u00d7 12 m) that allows us to derive such relevant information. So far, suitable approaches using a TanDEM-X DEM for the derivation of a normalized canopy model (nCM) are largely absent. Therefore, this paper aims to obtain digital terrain models (DTMs) for the subsequent computation of two nCMs for urban-like vegetation (e.g., street trees) and forest-like vegetation (e.g., parks), respectively, in Berlin, Germany, using a TanDEM-X DEM and a vegetation mask derived from UltraCam-X data. Initial comparisons between morphological DTM-filter confirm the superior performance of a novel disaggregated progressive morphological filter (DPMF). For improved assessment of a DTM for urban-like vegetation, a modified DPMF and image enhancement methods were applied. For forest-like vegetation, an interpolation and a weighted DPMF approach were compared. Finally, all DTMs were used for nCM calculation. The nCM for urban-like vegetation revealed a mean height of 4.17 m compared to 9.61 m of a validation nCM. For forest-like vegetation, the mean height for the nCM of the weighted filtering approach (9.16 m) produced the best results (validation nCM: 13.55 m). It is concluded that an nCM from TanDEM-X can capture vegetation heights in their appropriate dimension, which can be beneficial for automated height-related vegetation analysis such as comparisons of vegetation carbon storage between several cities.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "44732402675d34cc18e12bdc14514fb4dbe996c8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2888335502", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-99670-7_48", "CorpusId": 139443070}, "title": "Advanced Mineral Carbonation: An Approach to Accelerate CO2 Sequestration Using Steel Production Wastes and Integrated Fluidized Bed Reactor", "abstract": "Industrial pollution is the major source of global warming through emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG\u2019s) like CO2, CH4, and NO2, causing noticeable increasing in the world\u2019s temperature.

The stages involved include CO2 capture, transport of the captured CO2, utilisation and secure storage of the captured CO2. This chapter reports the use of eggshell and seashells biomaterials as an adsorbent to separate CO2 from other gases generated by power plants and industrial processes. The capture of carbon dioxide by adsorption is based on the ability of a material to preferentially adsorb or carbonate CO2 over other gases. In light of this, calcined eggshell and seashells biomaterial rich in calcium carbonate from which calcium oxide (94%) can be obtained have demonstrated a strong affinity for CO2. These biomaterials are abundant and low-cost alternative to zeolite, activated carbon and molecular sieve carbon. The mechanism of CO2 capture by eggshell and seashells derived CaO adsorbent comprises of a series of carbonation-calcination reactions (CCR): calcium oxide (CaO) reacts with CO2 resulting in calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which releases pure CO2 stream upon calcinations for sequestration or utilisation, and as a consequence, the biomaterial is regenerated. Findings reveal that these biomaterials can hold up to eight times its own weight of CO2 from flue gas stream.

One method proven to be quite effective for site assessment, leakage monitoring, and leakage verification is near-surface gas geochemistry, which includes soil gas concentration and gas flux measurements. Anomalous concentrations or fluxes, relative to the natural background values, can indicate the potential occurrence of a leak. However the natural background can be quite variable, especially for CO2 , due to biological production and accumulation in the soil that changes as a function of soil type, land use, geology, temperature, water content, and various other parameters. To better understand how these parameters influence natural, near-surface background values, and to examine the potential of different sampling strategies as a function of the survey goals, this paper reports results from two highly different case studies, one from northern Europe (Voulund, Denmark) and one from southern Europe (Sulcis, Sardinia, Italy). The small Voulund site, with its homogeneous soil, climate, and topography, was surveyed twice (in fall and in spring) within the EU-funded SiteChar project to examine the effects of different land use practices and seasons on baseline values. Forested land was found to have lower CO2 concentrations during both campaigns compared to cultivated and heath land, and higher CH4 values during the spring sampling campaign. Continuous monitoring probes showed much more detail, highlighting seasonal changes in soil gas CO2 concentrations linked primarily to temperature variations. The much larger Sulcis site, studied within an ENEA-funded project on potential CO2 -ECBM (Enhanced Coal Bed Methane) deployment, was surveyed at the regional scale and on detailed grids and transects for site assessment purposes. Despite the completely different soil and climate conditions, the statistical distribution of the Sulcis data was similar to that of Voulund. Much higher soil gas CO2 anomalies were found at this site, however, due to the less permeable sediments (i.e., better water retention and greater gas accumulation) and the warmer temperatures. Detailed surveys at this site highlighted various significant anomalies, some of which can be explained by near surface biological processes, whereas others, especially helium anomalies, were more difficult to explain. These results show the utility of baseline surveys, and highlight the need for follow-up studies to clarify any unexplained anomalies before any CO2 storage.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "559625e0523748b7687078ef10a72d6cd830aa7f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "137908832", "CorpusId": 127683430}, "title": "Barriers to Acting in Time on Energy, and Strategies for Overcoming Them", "abstract": "The five prior papers in this volume offer many excellent ideas on climate change, oil, transportation, and electricity policies, carbon capture and storage, and the generation of innovative energy solutions.

However, there is little seismic and well data to constrain reservoir modelling in the best notional injection area. To test the likely storage performance, three contrasting sector-scale static reservoir models were built to capture the range of geological uncertainty in facies distribution and reservoir properties. These considered sectors of the Surat Basin with different palaeogeographical arrangements. The models were focused on capturing detail at the interface between the top of the Precipice Sandstone (Blocky Sandstone Reservoir: BSR) and the overlying basal portions of the Evergreen Formation (Transition Zone: TZ), a critical area for understanding CO2 injection. Object modelling was used for the BSR and lower TZ. Stochastic modelling was implemented for the upper TZ and the Ultimate Seal because these zones were less sensitive to facies distributions. Porosity was modelled stochastically, and permeability calculated using porosity\u2013permeability transformation functions. Dynamic simulation showed the TZ has the capacity to arrest CO2 flow out of the BSR given appropriate CO2 injection conditions. This study shows a method of capturing uncertainty in geological heterogeneity when data are sparse or absent. The promising initial modelling results of CO2 injection into the Surat Basin suggests that it presents a real option for carbon storage at a climate mitigation scale.

What is the value, and the danger, of conceptualizing CO2 as a waste to be managed? This paper looks at the historical evolution of solid and liquid waste regimes to draw lessons for the future evolution of a gaseous waste regime. It finds that social decisions to clean up solid and liquid waste were driven by both culture and industry.

While surface nutrient supply impacts the elemental ratios of primary production, stoichiometric control by remineralization remains unclear. Here we develop a mechanistic description of remineralization and its stoichiometry in a marine microbial ecosystem model. The model simulates the observed elemental plasticity of phytoplankton and the relatively constant, lower C:N of heterotrophic biomass. In addition, the model captures the observed decreases in DOC:DON and the C:N remineralization ratio with depth for more labile substrates, which are driven by a switch in the dominant source of labile DOM from phytoplankton to heterotrophic biomass. Only a model version with targeted remineralization of N-rich components is able to simulate the observed profiles of preferential remineralization of DON relative to DOC and the elevated C:N of bulk DOM. The model suggests that more labile substrates are associated with C-limited heterotrophic growth and not with preferential remineralization, while more recalcitrant substrates are associated with growth limited by processing rates and with preferential remineralization. The resulting patterns of variable remineralization stoichiometry mediate the extent to which a proportional increase in carbon production resulting from changes in phytoplankton stoichiometry can increase the efficiency of the biological pump.

We then present saturation patterns for networks with homogeneous and heterogeneous contact angles distributions, based on two common reservoir minerals: quartz and mica, both of which have been well-characterized experimentally for their brine-CO(2) contact angles. At lower flow rates, we found moderately higher saturations for the heterogeneous networks than for the homogeneous ones. To characterize the fingering patterns, we have introduced R as the ratio of filled throats to the total network saturation.
