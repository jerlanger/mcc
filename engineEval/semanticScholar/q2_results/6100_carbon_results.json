Our estimates include the cost of marginal damages caused by coal plant emissions. On average, we estimate that the levelized cost of coal, including externalities, is $84/MWh. It is efficient to abate emissions of air pollutants (SO x , NO x and PM 2.5) but not of CO 2. Then the cost wrought by environmental externalities equals $23/MWh or 27% of total cost. Depending on the price of coal, the levelized cost of coal may vary between $72 and $99/MWh. The levelized cost of wind is $144/MWh with capacity factor of 24%. This cost includes the cost backup capacity to maintain LOLP, which equals $13/MWh or 9% of total cost. The levelized cost of wind varies between $107/MWh with capacity factors of 35% to $217/MWh with capacity factors of 15%. We conclude that wind is competitive only when it achieves capacity factors around 35% and coal prices are very high. So far the average annual capacity factor achieved by existing wind farms in Chile has been less than 20%, which suggests why wind has developed only slowly. I.

This action may cause pressure changes, which affect subsurface volumes. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the pressure changes during CO2 sequestration in CO2 storage formation embedded in a sequence of aquifers and aquitard of the Qianjiang depression area. In order to demonstrate the transient pressure, we have conducted TOUGH2 modeling of CO2 injection into closed formations of different thicknesses assuming impermeable boundaries. A 2-D radially symmetric model was developed to represent a CO2 storage site in the Qianjiang depression area. The storage formation into which CO2 is injected is 120 m thick and located at a depth of about 1530 m below the ground surface. The CO2 injection thickness was 25m from the bottom of the storage formation. Carbon dioxide is injected into a zone of 71 m radial extent representing a few distributed wells. Injection occurs at an annual rate of 1* 10 7 tonnes of CO2 representing six times the CO2 rate captured from a medium-size-coal-fired power plant.

Firstly, sorption capacity of CO2 and CH4 of hard coal and associated sorption-induced expansion of the material was measured. This investigation was maintained in isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. Experiments were done on purpose-design apparatus allowing simultaneous measurement of sorption kinetics and sorption-induced swelling/contraction of coal. Chosen coal sample had higher sorption capacity for CO2 when compare to capacity for CH4.. Next to CO2 storage, the topic of CO2 utilization has been investigated. Carbonation of European high-calcium fly ashes is assessed. The experiments have been done on different fly ashes with content of 5-36% CaO. Complementary, characterization and analysis of fly ash samples has been performed. Acceleration of carbonation has been explored. Experiments has been done in temperature range between 25 and 290\u00b0C, 1-12 bar of CO2, CO2 + H2O and simulated flue gas over reaction times between 2 and 72 hours. Major conclusions of this work is that increasing the temperature and pressure strongly enhances the process of carbonation. Also, addition of water vapor substantially accelerates the process and increase its kinetics. This thesis reports that maintaining the carbonation process without steam addition leads to effective carbonation conversion. Chemical fixation of CO2 molecules with solid material of fly ash with high content of CaO to produce calcium carbonate is possible. The highest sequestration capacity achieved is 117.7 g CO2/kg fly ash and highest carbonation efficiency obtained is 48%. The microstructural analysis of fly ash samples showed the evolution of the cenosphere surface according to the carbonation experiments conditions. Different shapes and sizes of calcium carbonate has been detected after carbonation experiments. The compositional constraints of fly ashes that control reaction with CO2 has been described. It was found that not the bulk content of CaO is the factor controlling the carbonation reaction, but the content of free lime. Impact on carbonation of two pressure flow systems was assessed: batch and continuous flow, with and without addition of steam. Using he batch treatment with addition of steam gave the highest carbonation efficiency. Another set of carbonation experiments which has been done was with using simulated flue gas (84% N2, 15% CO2, 1 % H2O) instead of pure CO2 stream, in conditions: 160\u00b0C, 6 bar of gas and 2 hours of reaction time. It was concluded that using flue gas instead of pure stream of carbon dioxide lowers the carbonation rate of about 9%. Final part of this research was to determine the change of free lime content in fly ash samples before and after carbonation. Carbonation reactions lead to substantial decrease of free lime contents in fly ashes. In most cases, the amount of free lime in fly ash after carbonation was compatible with the current EU legislations regarding fly ash incorporation to cement as admixture.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "9201404709c07308b9bb9c04244b5823644cf677", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2184397903", "CorpusId": 110202848}, "title": "Conceptual Design of 100 MWe Oxy-coal Power Plant-Youngdong Project", "abstract": "An existing unit of power plant is considered to refurbish it for possible application of carbon capture and storage(CCS).

Among other fossil fuels, natural gas also contributes significantly to the power sector in India. This contribution may increase in the future with exploration of new reserves of unconventional gases, more stringent climate norms and so on. Concurrently, the global climate change problem also becomes more enhanced if larger dependence on fossil fuels remains. In some scenarios, carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) with natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) may be a feasible technological alternative. Such a scenario is manifested by some critical factors such as low natural gas prices and high carbon tax, among others. Nevertheless, several parameters remain highly uncertain if CCS is to be introduced in NGCC plants. As a result, modern computational techniques such as soft-computing approaches may be used to generate predictive models for cost and performance in such plants.

Trade and Climate Change: A Mutually Supportive Policy", "abstract": "There are several links between trade and climate change, but in most cases these connections have been viewed as being in tension or in conflict. For example, there is concern that domestic climate change policies promoting renewable energy may be inconsistent with the rules prescribed by the World Trade Organization (WTO). There are further concerns that UN climate change discussions on the role of intellectual property may undermine WTO intellectual property rules. The potential for conflict between trade and climate change policy is real. However, trade policy can also be used to support climate change action. In particular, an international trade negotiation to reduce trade barriers for goods developed using low-carbon processes could support climate change policy and create incentive for businesses to reduce their greenhouse gas (GFIG) emissions. Uncertain Costs and Climate Change Policy At the UN climate change conference in Cancun in December 2010, participating countries agreed that by 20.50 global average temperature increases should be kept less than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Yet uncertainties over the costs of reaching this global goal loom large, particularly as this level of emission reductions will require all major economies to make significant transformations in the way they produce and consume energy in their transportation systems, industrial structures, and buildings. Moreover, many of the key climate change technologies, such as carbon capture and storage, smart grids, and storage for renewable energy are not fully developed. Nuclear energy, a key technology which many countries had included under their low emission scenarios, has been taken off the table in Japan and Germany after the recent Fukushima accident in Japan. A 2007 McKinsey & Company report estimates that by 2030 the annual worldwide costs of reducing emissions could be anywhere between US$750 and US$1,500 billion. However, the discussion of costs in the UN climate change negotiations has been limited to the obligation of developed countries to fund the incremental costs of mitigating and adapting to climate change in developing countries. While developing countries are expected to be the most significantly affected by climate change, developed countries have contributed the most to current concentrations of GHG emissions and have the resources to combat climate change. At the December 2009 Copenhagen Climate Change conference, developed countries proposed two streams of climate change finance--\"Fast Start\" financing of US$30 billion between 2010 and 2012, and US$100 billion per year to be mobilized by 2020. In contrast, the costs of meeting GHG mitigation targets have been left to each developed country to address. This is also true for large developing countries such as China, the world's largest GHG emitter, which will also have to significantly reduce its GHG emissions over time. However, China's trade surplus with the United States and European Union (EU) member countries, combined with its large holdings of foreign dept (including approximately US$1 trillion in US Treasuries), has made developed country financing of China's climate change policies politically infeasible. The costs of reducing GHG emissions in developed countries has also raised concerns about carbon leakage and competitiveness. Carbon leakage arises when climate change policies lead to no net reduction in GHG emissions, as businesses seek to avoid the costs of climate change policies by relocating to developing countries with less strict climate change regulations. Competitiveness concerns are closely related to this issue and arise when the costs of climate change policies, which are most pronounced for carbon intensive industries such as cement, steel, and aluminum, lead to a loss of market share to imports from countries not facing similar carbon costs. Any assessment of the costs of climate change policy also needs to account for the economic benefits, the most significant in avoiding the costs of climate change. \u2026", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "dbb11ce8a80ab9707b16ccb3ff90458638713dac", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2608290589", "DOI": "10.14512/GAIA.18.4.7", "CorpusId": 157450465}, "title": "CO2-Abscheidung und -Lagerung im Rahmen des Clean Development Mechanism: Chancen und RisikenCarbon Dioxide Capture and Storage under the Clean Development Mechanism: Opportunities and Risks", "abstract": "To mitigate the dangerous impacts of climate change, anthropogenic CO2 emissions must be reduced drastically.

Unfortunately, CO2 is a stable compound with a low energy state and does not readily participate in chemical reactions without added energy. Additionally, the supply of CO2 that may be available as the USA moves toward a carbon-constrained economy far exceeds the current demand for CO2 as a commodity chemical.

Successful in situ measurements in the dusty, high-pressure syngas flow were enabled by Stanford\u2019s normalized and scanned wavelength modulation strategy. A prototype sensor for CO, CH4, CO2, and H2O was refined with experiments conducted in the laboratory at Stanford University, a pilot-scale at the University of Utah, and an engineering-scale gasifier at DoE\u2019s National Center for Carbon Capture with the demonstrationmore\u00a0\u00bb of a prototype sensor with technical readiness level 6 in the 2014 measurement campaign.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "a05950fc959306f2644807f0131868879ac1578b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "823482432", "CorpusId": 220954712}, "title": "CO 2 Separation Techniques Using Ionic Liquids", "abstract": "Since carbon dioxide, , was revealed as a major greenhouse gas, techniques for its separation, capture, and storage have received increasing interest in recent years. Aqueous amines are the most widely accepted absorbents, but they cause the problems such as high regeneration energy, thermal degradation, and loss of absorbents due to their volatility. Ionic liquids having high thermal stability, extremely low vapor pressure, and capability of selectively absorbing specific gases have been proposed as new capturing solvents which may potentially replace aqueous amines. By reviewing the ionic liquids having capability to absorb reported in previous papers, we seek to develop a comprehensive understanding on the factors that influence the solubility in ionic liquids such as their structures, absorption temperature, pressure, water content, etc., and to estimate the potential of ionic liquids as separating media.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "73bb1e5be291603f29455917086e03682d9d7f6d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2474823245", "DOI": "10.1002/ENTE.201600030", "CorpusId": 99313533}, "title": "Contribution to the Modeling and Simulation of the Iron-Based Chemical Looping Combustion Process", "abstract": "The increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are directly linked to climate change. Given that most of the world's electric energy comes from fossil-fuel power plants, which produce a large amount of greenhouse gas (i.e., CO2), carbon capture and storage technologies seem to be a viable solution to reduce CO2 emissions. To investigate fossil-fuel chemical looping combustion in fluidized bed columns, a dynamic mathematical model was herein developed. The complex phenomena taking place in the iron-based chemical looping combustion process are described by assuming a pseudo-homogeneous system and a plug\u2013flow regime for the fluidized columns. The mass and energy balance equations were written by using partial differential equations for both the gaseous and solid phases present in the process. The distribution and temperatures profiles of the gaseous and solid components as well as a study on the influence of the superficial gas velocity on the particle distribution were generated by model simulation. This computational approach allows for significant progress in the systematic analysis of chemical looping combustion to assess its potential for integration into the next generation of fossil-fuel power plants.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "631926ccb5506d9f483c5544c8f742e1dd57a8d5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3004790141", "CorpusId": 217015703}, "title": "Globale Entwicklung der CCS-Technologie und ihre Rolle als m\u00f6gliche Klimaschutzma\u00dfnahme", "abstract": "Der von der Menschheit seit der industriellen Revolution verursachte Anteil am Klimawandel r\u00fcckt durch die breite Diskussion einer umweltschonenden und zuverl\u00e4ssigen Energieversorgung immer mehr in den Fokus der \u00d6ffentlichkeit.

The optimization takes into account the possible implementation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the possibility of constructing new power plants, with or without CCS, to maintain or increase electricity to the grid depending on the growth in electricity demand. The model is formulated as Mixed Integer Non Linear Programme (MINLP) and implemented in GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System). Exact linearization techniques were employed to facilitate solution development. Three mitigation options were considered in this study: fuel balancing (optimal adjustment of the operation of existing generating stations to reduce CO2 emissions without making structural changes to the fleet), fuel switching (switching from carbon intensive fuel to less carbon intensive fuel, e.g. coal to natural gas) and retrofitting CCS on existing coal fired power plants. Both, fuel switching and retrofitting CCS involve structural changes on the existing fleet. The computer programme is capable of determining the best mix of fuel, annual capacity factor for existing power plants, location and size of CO2 capture process and finally, construction of new

primary global environmental concern due to its detrimental impacts on climate change. A significant reduction in CO2 generation together with its capture and storage is an imperative need of the time. CO2 can be captured from power plants and other industries through various methods such as absorption, adsorption, membranes, physical and biological separation techniques. The most widely used systems are solvent based CO2 absorption method. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of various random and structured packing materials in absorption column on CO2 removing efficiency. Aspen plus was used to develop the CO2 capture model for different packing materials with Monoethanolamine (MEA) solvent in order to optimize the system. It was found that the lowest re-boiler duty of 3,444 kJ/KgCO2 yield the highest rich CO2 loading of 0.475 (mole CO2/mole MEA) by using the BX type of structured packing having the highest surface area. The surface area of the different packing materials were inversely proportional to the temperature profiles along the column. Furthermore, the packing materials with higher surface areas yielded higher CO2 loading profiles and vice versa. The findings of this study and recommendation would help further research on optimization of solvent-based CO2 capturing technologies.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "5cac9ecca95f425d7f12ef9df547284bc2fde193", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2736497466", "DOI": "10.1088/2058-7058/25/05/24", "CorpusId": 125969091}, "title": "UK co-ordinates research on carbon capture and storage", "abstract": "A new \u00a313m centre to co-ordinate the UK's research into carbon capture and storage (CCS) is to be set up at the University of Edinburgh.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "6771e04833b8138230117c528648ef82cdf1594a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2583293553", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1253962", "CorpusId": 51600826}, "title": "AAAS News and Notes", "abstract": "164 During a visit to the People\u2019s Republic of China, Science Editor-in-Chief Marcia McNutt had the opportunity to meet with Premier Li Keqiang in Beijing on 13 January 2014.

The full transcript is available online (www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/ science.1253962/DC1).] Much of the conversation centered around China\u2019s challenge of sustainably developing resources for economic growth while preserving the natural environment and curbing greenhouse gas emissions. There is no precedent for tackling these problems while supporting a population as large as China\u2019s 1.3 billion. Furthermore, China has been on an accelerated path to modernization, playing \u201ccatch up\u201d since the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s. Li explained that China has been heavily investing in environmental science and clean energy technologies as part of its strategy to propel the nation into the 21st century. As further evidence of China\u2019s commitment to address environmental problems, Li pointed to efforts under way to tame air and water pollution in China. As more Chinese citizens attain middle-class economic status and fi nd their basic life needs met, they are paying more attention to quality of life. Although past Chinese leaders declared a war on poverty, and that war continues, the current leadership has now also declared a war on pollution. As a fi rst step, Li explained that China is using science to address the human contribution to smog in major cities, moving beyond monitoring to take action to treat it. He noted that China has raised fuel standards to cut vehicle exhaust, developed clean technologies for coal use, taken steps to prevent the spread of dust from construction sites, carried out afforestation in arid landscapes, and returned unproductive cultivated land to forests. He said his nation is developing the world\u2019s largest wind power capacity, expanding solar energy, and investing in carbon capture and storage technologies and new battery technologies for electric cars that require less palladium, platinum, and other limited resources. China is more than doubling the number of nuclear power plants while setting aggressive targets to lower overall energy consumption. Li believes that developing renewable energy and conserving energy and resources can together contribute to GDP growth while preserving the environment. With all the current policies in place, China\u2019s energy-saving and environmental industries will have a market value of 4.5 trillion RMB yuan by 2015 (approximately US$720 billion at current exchange rates) and will soon approach US$1 trillion. This is why, he said, many companies and research institutions developing nuclear power, carbon capture, and clean energy have turned their attention to China. Clean water in China is also a major concern. Contaminated water takes a heavy toll on human health. In rural areas, 100 million to 110 million people still do not have access to safe drinking water. Last year, with the support of central and local budgets and funds raised by individuals, Li said that China began providing clean water to over 60 million people. The plan is to extend that initiative to another 60 million people this year, and the remaining 50 million next year. By then, the drinking water problem will be basically solved. However, highly polluted water still accounts for more than 10% of China\u2019s total water resources; a plan is required to resolve this issue. The following are excerpts from the conversation.

Many governments are now calling for aggressive and immediate measures to avoid what they fear could be the catastrophic consequences of climate change. This sense of urgency could breathe new life into carbon capture and storage, a technology hailed by the oil and gas industry that has gained little traction in the past decade.\n Carbon capture and storage involves capturing carbon dioxide from large sources such as power plants or other industry, transporting it to a storage site, and burying it to keep it from entering the atmosphere. Storage, or sequestration, of the CO2 would most likely be in deep geological formations, or possibly in the ocean. The US National Energy Technology Laboratory has reported that North America alone could store 900 years\u2019 worth of carbon dioxide underground. It is a potentially cost-effective way to decarbonize industries such as petrochemicals, cement, steel, and power generation. The idea is that this would help mitigate CO2 emissions from hydrocarbons and would complement other alternative energy solutions as momentum builds for a carbon-constrained world.\n The technology has had broad oil and gas industry support for over a decade. The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative\u2014whose members include 13 major oil companies including BP, Shell, ExxonMobil, Saudi Aramco, and Equinor\u2014has long touted the method and recently held a workshop on the potential of carbon capture in the Middle East. Participants discussed how governments in the region and industry can create clean and sustainable industries by capturing carbon dioxide from oil and gas production and use.\n Even though the idea is not new, carbon capture is often seen as unworkable because of the cost and concerns about the effects of storage. But the UN recently cited the technology as one of numerous ideas to combat climate change. \u201cIt\u2019s about changing the way people look at CCS from thinking that it is kind of inevitable but impossible and turning into kind of necessary and doable,\u201d Fiona Wild, the head of climate change and sustainability at BHP Billiton, said at an industry conference in November. \u201cWe need to get policy regimes in place that support development over the longer term because we need scale.\u201d\n Other attendees at that conference were executives from the International Energy Agency, BP, Shell, Total, Equinor, and the British Energy Ministry. All were in agreement that the time is right to revitalize interest in the technology. Meanwhile, projects are slowing moving forward. The Climate Initiative recently entered into a strategic partnership with several major oil companies to promote the Clean Gas Project, the UK\u2019s first commercial full-chain carbon capture and storage project. And, in late November, ADNOC announced that it would expand carbon capture and storage from either a major gas processing facility or the Shah gas plant.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "e7c5566fd30a036f2f7069126517d2bb330881f8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2378102711", "CorpusId": 130174513}, "title": "Discussion on the carbon dioxide capture and storage technology", "abstract": "The carbon dioxide capture and storage technology(CCS) is a new technology which can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and global warming effect.Some challenges with CCS was analyzed in this paper.The development of renewable low carbon dioxide emission or no carbon emission energy must be strengthened with CCS development.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "7f9aa8736241cb5b87434deb682bef90867bca4d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3157345803", "DOI": "10.21203/RS.3.RS-422173/V1", "CorpusId": 235501269}, "title": "The consequences of inaction on carbon dioxide removal", "abstract": "\n Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be essential to meet the climate targets, so enabling its deployment at the right time will be decisive.

New emissions targets have been announced in April 2021 by various governments, including by the United Kingdom, United States, and China, prior to the Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow. Part of the solution for net zero will be geo-energy technologies in the subsurface, these include: mine water geothermal, aquifer thermal energy storage (ATES), enhanced geothermal systems and other thermal storage options, compressed air energy storage (CAES), and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) including bioenergy CCS (BECCS). Subsurface net zero technologies have been studied by geologists at laboratory scale and with models, but also require testing at greater-than laboratory scale and in representative conditions not reproducible in laboratories and models. Test, pilot and demonstration facilities aid rock characterisation process understanding and up-scaling, and thereby provide a bridge between laboratory testing and computer modelling and full-scale operation. Examples of test sites that have progressed technology development include the Otway International Test Centre (Australia, CCS) and the \u00c4sp\u00f6 Hard Rock Laboratory (Sweden, geological radioactive waste disposal). These sites have provided scale up for key research questions allowing science issues of relevance to regulation, licencing and permitting to be examined at scale in controlled environments.

Assessing the Need for High Impact Technology Research, Development & Deployment for Mitigating Climate Change", "abstract": "Technology is a centrally important component of all strategies to mitigate climate change. As such, it encompasses a multi-dimensional space that is far too large to be fully addressed in this brief chapter. Consequently, we have elected to focus on a subset of topics that we believe have the potential for substantial impact. As researchers, we have also narrowed our focus to address applied research, development and deployment issues and omit basic research topics that have a longer-term impact. This handful of topics also omits technologies that we deem to be relatively mature, such as solar photovoltaics and wind turbines, even though we acknowledge that additional research could further reduce costs and enhance performance. These and other mature technologies such as transportation are discussed in Chapter 6. This report and the related Summit Conference are an outgrowth of the University of California President\u2019s Carbon Neutrality Initiative, and consequently we are strongly motivated by the special demands of this ambitious goal, as we are also motivated by the corresponding goals for the State of California, the nation and the world. The unique feature of the UC Carbon Neutrality Initiative is the quest to achieve zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2025 at all ten 10 campuses. It should be emphasized that a zero emission target is enormously demanding and requires careful strategic planning to arrive at a mix of technologies, policies, and behavioral measures, as well as highly effective communication \u2013 all of which are far more challenging than reducing emissions by some 40% or even 80%. Each campus has a unique set of requirements based on its current energy and emissions. Factors such as a local climate, dependence on cogeneration, access to wholesale electricity markets, and whether a medical school is included shape the specific challenges of the campuses, each of which is a \u201cliving laboratory\u201d setting a model for others to learn and adopt.\u00a0 An additional aspect of a zero GHG emission target is the need to pay close attention to system integration \u2013 i.e., how the various elements of a plan to achieve carbon neutrality fit together in the most cost effective and efficient way. This optimization imposes an additional constraint, but also provides an important opportunity to capture the synergies that can arise from those choices. For example, one of the themes that has been proposed is the complete electrification of energy supplies, residential & commercial building operation, and transportation. The deployment of storage technologies such as batteries and/or hydrogen for both transportation and for load balancing of grid and distributed generation may provide some synergistic opportunities for integrating these systems that will accelerate the deployment of each. A specific example is the use of on-board batteries in electric vehicles for load balancing the electric grid. On-site residential storage as is now being developed by Tesla Motors, has the potential to accelerate the deployment of residential solar installations. In the case of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, the necessary infrastructure to provide a network of hydrogen filling stations might also accelerate the use of hydrogen for storage on the electric grid by using excess solar capacity to produce hydrogen by electrolysis.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "6110d071824de5ae310437d6a9fd846e2ef0ba21", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fenrg.2021.770599", "CorpusId": 244104149}, "title": "Influence of Direct Current\u2013Voltage Accompanied by Charge Flow on CO2 Hydrate Formation", "abstract": "The capture and storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) are urgent and crucial to achieve the goal of carbon neutrality.

Beyond the land (forests), there is little appreciation of just how important ocean nature is to climate mitigation. Carbon captured, stored and the rate at which it is buried (sequestration) by marine organisms is called blue carbon. We measured how much blue carbon occurs around the remote islands and seamounts of the Tristan da Cunha archipelago Marine Protected Zone (MPZ). We estimated that there are 300 tonnes of carbon (tC) captured in seaweed biomass each year, a proportion of which will sink and become a part of the long-term sediment carbon store. In deeper water we found a standing stock of ~2.3 million tC in the shallowest 1000 m depths, of which equivalent to 0.8 million t of carbon dioxide has the potential to be sequestered. At current carbon prices, and were it to attract blue carbon credits, \u00a324 million worth of blue carbon can potentially be sequestered from the standing stock of this small United Kingdom Overseas Territory. This standing stock is protected and growth could, therefore, generate an additional \u00a33.5 million worth of sequestered carbon a year, making it an unrecognized major component of the local economy. The economic return on this example MPZ probably ranks highly amongst climate mitigation schemes. The message is that placing meaningful protection to carbon-rich natural habitats can massively help society fight climate change and biodiversity loss. Nations who provide this protection should be fairly compensated, particularly where it comes at the detriment of other economic uses of marine habitats. Abstract Carbon-rich habitats can provide powerful climate mitigation if meaningful protection is put in place. We attempted to quantify this around the Tristan da Cunha archipelago Marine Protected Area. Its shallows (<1000 m depth) are varied and productive. The 5.4 km2 of kelp stores ~60 tonnes of carbon (tC) and may export ~240 tC into surrounding depths. In deep-waters we analysed seabed data collected from three research cruises, including seabed mapping, camera imagery, seabed oceanography and benthic samples from mini-Agassiz trawl. Rich biological assemblages on seamounts significantly differed to the islands and carbon storage had complex drivers. We estimate ~2.3 million tC are stored in benthic biodiversity of waters <1000 m, which includes >0.22 million tC that can be sequestered (the proportion of the carbon captured that is expected to become buried in sediment or locked away in skeletal tissue for at least 100 years). Much of this carbon is captured by cold-water coral reefs as a mixture of inorganic (largely calcium carbonate) and organic compounds. As part of its 2020 Marine Protection Strategy, these deep-water reef systems are now protected by a full bottom-trawling ban throughout Tristan da Cunha and representative no take areas on its seamounts. This small United Kingdom Overseas Territory\u2019s reef systems represent approximately 0.8 Mt CO2 equivalent sequestered carbon; valued at >\u00a324 Million GBP (at the UN shadow price of carbon). Annual productivity of this protected standing stock generates an estimated \u00a33 million worth of sequestered carbon a year, making it an unrecognized and potentially major component of the economy of small island nations like Tristan da Cunha.

In CO2 pipelines for CCS, there are still challenges and gaps in knowledge in the pipeline transportation of supercritical CO2 due to its unique thermophysical properties as a single, dense phase liquid above its critical point. Although the design and operation of pipelines for bulk fluid transport is well established, the design stage is incomplete without the heat transfer calculations as part of the steady state hydraulic and flow assurance design stages. This paper investigates the steady state heat transfer in a buried onshore dense phase CO2 pipelines analytically using the conduction shape factor and thermal resistance method to evaluate for the heat loss from an uninsulated pipeline.\n A parametric study that critically analyses the effect of variation in pipeline burial depth and soil thermal conductivity on the heat transfer rate, soil thermal resistance and the overall heat transfer coefficient (OHTC) is investigated.

Earth Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory; 2. Department of Energy Resources Engineering, Stanford University Well blowouts are one type of event in hydrocarbon exploration and production that generates health, safety, environmental and financial risk. Well blowouts are variously defined as \u201cuncontrolled flow of well fluids and/or formation fluids from the wellbore\u201d 1 or \u201cuncontrolled flow of reservoir fluids into the wellbore\u201d. 2 Theoretically this is irrespective of flux rate and so would include low fluxes, often termed \u201cleakage\u201d. In practice, such low-flux events are not considered well blowouts. 3,4 Rather, the term well blowout applies to higher fluxes that rise to attention more acutely, typically in the order of seconds to days after the event commences. It is not unusual for insurance claims for well blowouts to exceed US$10 million. 5 This does not imply that all blowouts are this costly, as it is likely claims are filed only for the most catastrophic events. Still, insuring against the risk of loss of well control is the costliest in the industry. 5 Consequently, quantifying this risk is of considerable interest. The risk of well blowouts was recently quantified from an assembled database of 102 events occurring in California Oil and Gas District 4 during the period 1991 to 2005, inclusive. 6 This article reviews those findings, updates them to a certain extent and compares them with other well blowout risk study results. It also provides an improved perspective on some of the findings. In short, this update finds that blowout rates have remained constant from 2005 to 2008 within the limits of resolution and that the decline in blowout rates from 1991 to 2005 was likely due to improved industry practice. California Oil and Gas District 4 The oil and gas fields in District 4 are all located in the southern San Joaquin Basin shown in Figure 1. 7 Three-quarters of the oil production in California was from these fields during the study period. Three-fifths of the oil production in the District was via thermally enhanced recovery. Most of the fields in District 4 are in areas with low population densities, as shown in Figure 2. Some of these fields have a high density of steam injection wells for thermal recovery.

Investigating such relationships can increase understanding of how novel organelles are acquired. Here, we integrate multiple subcellular approaches to show how a unicellular host manipulates the bioenergetic machinery of its algal endosymbionts and maximizes organic carbon production for its own benefit. Symbionts are blocked from dividing, but their photosynthetic machinery and associated mitochondrial network dramatically expand while keeping close physical proximity to each other. Genes involved in photosynthesis and carbon fixation are up-regulated, while those for carbon storage are down-regulated. Such extreme remodeling of microalgae has not been reported in other photosymbioses and provides insight into the putative early steps of plastid acquisition. Endosymbioses have shaped the evolutionary trajectory of life and remain ecologically important. Investigating oceanic photosymbioses can illuminate how algal endosymbionts are energetically exploited by their heterotrophic hosts and inform on putative initial steps of plastid acquisition in eukaryotes. By combining three-dimensional subcellular imaging with photophysiology, carbon flux imaging, and transcriptomics, we show that cell division of endosymbionts (Phaeocystis) is blocked within hosts (Acantharia) and that their cellular architecture and bioenergetic machinery are radically altered. Transcriptional evidence indicates that a nutrient-independent mechanism prevents symbiont cell division and decouples nuclear and plastid division. As endosymbiont plastids proliferate, the volume of the photosynthetic machinery volume increases 100-fold in correlation with the expansion of a reticular mitochondrial network in close proximity to plastids. Photosynthetic efficiency tends to increase with cell size, and photon propagation modeling indicates that the networked mitochondrial architecture enhances light capture. This is accompanied by 150-fold higher carbon uptake and up-regulation of genes involved in photosynthesis and carbon fixation, which, in conjunction with a ca.15-fold size increase of pyrenoids demonstrates enhanced primary production in symbiosis. Mass spectrometry imaging revealed major carbon allocation to plastids and transfer to the host cell. As in most photosymbioses, microalgae are contained within a host phagosome (symbiosome), but here, the phagosome invaginates into enlarged microalgal cells, perhaps to optimize metabolic exchange. This observation adds evidence that the algal metamorphosis is irreversible. Hosts, therefore, trigger and benefit from major bioenergetic remodeling of symbiotic microalgae with potential consequences for the oceanic carbon cycle. Unlike other photosymbioses, this interaction represents a so-called cytoklepty, which is a putative initial step toward plastid acquisition.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "28a17d73c5057e3cfd59c0c393acd43d7c4f2a15", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2273943646", "DOI": "10.2172/1126713", "CorpusId": 111612085}, "title": "Microbial and Chemical Enhancement of In-Situ Carbon Mineralization in Geological Formation", "abstract": "Predictions of global energy usage suggest a continued increase in carbon emissions and rising concentrations of CO{sub 2} in the atmosphere unless major changes are made to the way energy is produced and used.

The Ru in the DFM, in combination with H2, catalytically hydrogenates both adsorbed CO2 and the bulk Na2CO3, forming methane. The depleted sites adsorb CO2 through a carbonate reformation process and in addition adsorb CO2 on its surface. This material functions well in O2- and H2O-containing flue gas where the favorable Ru redox property allows RuOx, formed during flue gas exposure, to be reduced during the hydrogenation cycle.

Low-volume expansion carbon material is the ideal choice of anode material. However, the low specific capacity has gradually become the shortcoming for the development of LIBs and thus developing new carbon material with high specific capacity is urgently needed.

Carbon capture storage refers to the process of capturing or gathering carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere from various activities and injecting the captured gas underground (aquifer). CCS can be divided into 3 main stages namely capturing, transportation and storage. The carbon dioxide will be captured from a source, being transported and sequestrated underground. In this paper, the main area discussed is the capturing process and application in steelmaking industry from economical point of view. Carbon capture is an expensive process which creates an indecisiveness among different parties to actually put the process in practice. However, this expensive process is not properly quantified which is the main motivation of this study to contribute to the cost quantification of carbon capture. Carbon capture is mainly divided to several methods namely membrane separation, oxyfuel combustion, absorption, adsorption, chemical looping combustion, calcium looping and cryogenic method.

Injected CO2 must remain efficiently isolated from the atmosphere on a timescale of the order of10 years and greater. Natural CO2-rich sites can be investigated to understand the behaviour of CO2 in geological formations on such a timescale. This thesis examines the reservoir and seal on one such oilfield. Several hydrocarbon fields in the South Viking Graben of the North Sea naturally contain CO2, which is thought to have charged from depth along the western boundary fault of the graben. The Miller oil field which contains ~ 28 mol% CO2, of isotopic composition \u03b4C = -8.2\u2030. The Upper Jurassic Brae Formation reservoir sandstones and the Kimmeridge Clay Formation (KCF) seal have been exposed to the CO2 accumulation since its emplacement. Rock samples from the reservoir sandstone and bottom of the seal mudrock were examined using multiple techniques, including XRD, SEM, fluid inclusion and carbonate stable isotope analyses. The sandstones show no features directly attributable to abundant CO2 charge. SEM analyses reveal significant heterogeneities in diagenesis within the KCF. The silt/sand lithologies of the KCF have undergone a diagenetic history similar to that of the Brae Formation sandstones. In contrast, the KCF shales display a distinctly different diagenesis of dominant dissolution of quartz and feldspar with little evidence of mineral precipitation. In both the Brae Formation and the KCF, pore-filling kaolinite, illite and carbonates are relatively late diagenetic events which can be associated with CO2-induced feldspar dissolution. Mudrock X-ray diffraction mineralogical data reveal abrupt vertical mineralogical variations across the reservoir crest in the Miller Field, while such variations are absent in a low-CO2 control well in the same geological settings. This suggests that reactions induced by abundant CO2 dissolved feldspar and produced kaolinite, carbonates and quartz in the seal, while oil emplacement inhibited the reactions in the oil leg. However, petrographic evidence and comparison between different sections argue against CO2 reactions as the sole cause for such large mineralogical variations, especially for quartz. The vertical mineralogical variations to a certain extend represent original sedimentary heterogeneity. Linear variations of carbonate \u03b4C with depth were discovered in both shale and silt/sand lithologies of the KCF in a 12m zone immediately above the reservoir. These features are absent in the low-CO2 control well. These trends are interpreted as dissolution of original carbonates by CO2 slowly ascending from the reservoir. New carbonates precipitated from a carbon source with upwards decreasing \u03b4C due to mixing between three carbon sources with different C isotopes at systematically varying ratios. The isotopes in the reservoir and the bottom of the seal suggests initial CO2 charge at about 70-80 Ma. CO2 infiltration rate is estimated at about 9.8\u00d710g\u00b7cm\u00b7y. Geochemical modelling was applied to reconstruct the reservoir fluid evolution by calibrating it to mineralogy, fluid chemistry, diagenesis and fluid inclusion data. The modelling suggests that CO2 migrated into the reservoir together with a saline basinal fluid derived from the underlying evaporites at ~ 70 Ma. The CO2 and basinal water charge imposed an important influence on the mineral reactions and fluid chemistry. This study suggests that the KCF has formed an excellent CO2 seal, with no substantial breach since its charge at 70-80 Ma.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "b780a2f5459e13dd0a3459e17e61ba987c40a549", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3154448828", "DOI": "10.4236/MSCE.2021.94004", "CorpusId": 234837404}, "title": "Carbon Dioxide Capture and Application Technology", "abstract": "This paper focuses on the supplementary explanation and modification of the six published articles for 8 aspects.

In this paper we present initial scoping studies for three possible alternative biogeochemical-engineering carbon management schemes suggested by observations from our studies of petroleum systems and fossil fuel energy recovery systems. We evaluate the feasibility of recovering hydrogen, instead of oil, directly from oilfields undergoing natural biodegradation processes and we also examine the feasibility of using a related process, biologically assisted carbon capture and conversion of CO2 to methane, via H2 + CO2 methanogenesis in the hydrogen-rich environments of weathering subsurface ultrabasic rocks, as a route to recycle carbon dioxide in flue gases as methane.

This system comprises three interconnected fluidized-bed reactors operating at atmospheric pressure. H2 is produced in a sorption enhanced reforming (SER) stage, where the presence of a CaO-based sorbent allows the CO2 to be removed as it is formed. The main novelty of the process concerns the regeneration of the CaCO3, required to carry out a multicycle operation. A redox chemical loop supplies the heat necessary for the calcination. The CaCO3 formed in the SER is put in contact with a very high-temperature solids stream, which is mainly composed of Fe2O3 resulting from the exothermic oxidation of Fe3O4 with air in a separate reactor (at 950 oC 1,200 oC). The calciner also acts as a fuel reactor, where Fe2O3 is reduced again to Fe3O4 by feeding a fuel gas, which is converted to CO2 and steam. A preliminary thermodynamic assessment of the proposed system has been carried out reaching H2 equivalent efficiencies of up to 79 %, which are around 9 % points above the efficiency of a reference H2 production plant based on conventional steam reforming including CO2 capture with MDEA. Carbon capture efficiencies of around 98 % can be obtained, which are significantly higher than those obtained in the reference plant that uses MDEA absorption (around 85 %).

For this research, an artificial CO2\u2010infused water injection experiment was performed in a shallow aquifer by monitoring hydrogeochemical parameters, including 222Rn. Radon in groundwater can be a useful tracer because of its sensitivity to sudden changes in subsurface environment. To monitor the CO2 plume migration, the data were analysed based on (a) the influence of mixing processes on the distribution of 222Rn induced by the artificial injection experiment and (b) the influence of a carrier gas role by CO2 on the variation of 222Rn. The spatio\u2010temporal distributions of radon concentrations were successfully explained in association with horizontal and vertical mixing processes by the CO2\u2010infused water injection. Additionally, the mixing ratios of each monitoring well were calculated, quantitatively confirming the influence of these mixing processes on the distribution of radon concentrations. Moreover, one monitoring well showed a high positive relationship between 222Rn and Total dissolved inorganic carbon (TIC) by the carrier gas effect of CO2 through volatilization from the CO2 plume. It indicated the applicability of 222Rn as a sensitive tracer to directly monitor CO2 leakage. When with a little effect of carrier gas, natural 222Rn in groundwater can be used to compute mixing ratio of CO2\u2010infused water indicative of CO2 migration pathways.

To address this problem, we report a methane nano-trap that features oppositely adjacent open metal sites and dense alkyl groups in a metal\u2013organic framework (MOF). The alkyl MOF-based methane nano-trap exhibits a record-high methane uptake and CH4/N2 selectivity at 298 K and 1 bar. The methane molecules trapped within the alkyl MOF were crystalographically identified by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments, which in combination with molecular simulation studies unveiled the methane adsorption mechanism within the MOF-based nano-trap. The IAST calculations and the breakthrough experiments revealed that the alkyl MOF-based methane nano-trap is a new benchmark for CH4/N2 separation, thereby providing a new perspective for capturing methane from coal-mine methane to recover fuel and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Global warming, which is caused by the ever-increasing amount of greenhouse gases, is indisputably one of the most urgent and compelling problems this century. As one of the major greenhouse gas, methane has significant effects as a greenhouse gas being 21 times higher than that of carbon dioxide, thereby causing serious environmental issues. In recent years, about 29 to 41 billion cubic meters of methane have been liberated from underground coal mines, as coalmine methane (CMM) every year, of which over 70% are directly vented to the atmosphere. Further, the poor-quality CMM (methane content less than 50%, mainly balanced by nitrogen, usually at standard pressure) is difficult to be directly utilized. Therefore, the separation of CH4 from N2 in poor-quality CMM could decrease the release of methane into the atmosphere while producing fuel gas concurrently, thereby generating significant economic and environmental benefits. Compared with traditional cryogenic distillation, adsorbent-based gas separation methods, including pressure swing adsorption, temperature swing adsorption, and membranes, have been shown to be promising technologies to separate gases owing to their high energy efficiency and intrinsic economic feasibility. However, the adsorptive separation of CH4/N2 mixtures has been found to be particularly difficult because of their similar kinetic diameters (3.8 for CH4 and 3.6 for N2) and comparable polarizability. [6] Traditional adsorbents of activated carbons and zeolites have been developed for CH4/N2 adsorptive separation, but they show a quite low separation selectivity and productivity, thus urging the exploration of new types of adsorbents that can efficiently separate CH4 from N2. As the emerging custom-designed porous materials, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) show outstanding performance in gas separation owing to their tunable pore sizes and diverse functionalities. In particular, the explicit singlecrystal structure of MOF provides the opportunity to investigate the adsorption mechanism for specific gases, which can facilitate the design of new materials with better performance. Given the fact that CH4 exhibits a slightly larger polarizability than N2 (CH4: 26.0 10 25 cm, N2: 17.6 10 25 cm), we reason that it is essential to increase the effective contact area or form multiple interactions to enhance the interaction between CH4 molecules and the host framework for efficient CH4/N2 separation. Although some MOFs display excellent performance in high-pressure methane storage, current top-performing MOFs exhibit low selectivity or low productivity for CH4/N2 separation at atmospheric pressure, [11] thus necessitating the development of new materials featuring stronger binding for capturing methane from CMM. To achieve strong methane binding within a MOF, we contribute a new type of methane nano-trap that features oppositely adjacent coordinatively unsaturated metal centers and densely populated alkyl groups thus providing a methanephilic environment to trap methane molecules. Although it is known that coordinatively unsaturated metal centers can bind methane significantly, current MOFs with such open metal sites are ineffective in capturing methane at ambient/ sub-ambient atmosphere owing to inadequate overlap of potential fields from opposite pore walls. As illustrated in Scheme 1, when two opposite coordinatively unsaturated metal centers are adjacent to each other, a nano-trap for methane can be generated based on the cooperative Coulombic interaction between the methane molecules and the two metal centers. In this regard, we chose an alkyl MOF, ATC-Cu, which features unique oppositely adjacent Cupaddle wheel open metal sites and low polarity aliphatic [*] Dr. Z. Niu, Dr. X. Cui, Dr. T. Pham, P. C.

Indeed, modelling suggests that hundreds to thousands of gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 will need to be removed over this century depending on global mean temperature goals and the success of emissions reduction. Natural CDR processes already remove in excess of 22 Gt y\u20131 of CO2 from the atmosphere, and thus significantly moderate the climate effects of our current 41 Gt yr\u20131 of emissions1. Numerous approaches for increasing this removal by natural or artificial means have been proposed. However, none of these have been demonstrated and proven at the required scales, and their economic, social and environmental disruption are potentially prohibitive. For these reasons, a significant research and development (R&D) effort is urgently needed to fully understand the types, capacities, costs and impacts of such methods so as to best determine which to deploy, and at what scale. A recent United States National Academy of Science, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM)2 report addresses the potentials and status of six general methods of CDR, and recommends an R&D investment of tens of billions of US$ over the next 20 years. The report estimates that these six methods comprise a maximum global CDR potential of about 10 Gt yr\u20131 when removal costs are limited to $100 per tonne of CO2 or less. This level of CDR likely comes with significant land-use tradeoffs \u2014 in particular, impacts to food and fibre production, and to environmental services \u2014 that could limit CDR to significantly below 10 Gt yr\u20131. The proposed R&D will better determine this limit, but if it remains at this magnitude it brings into question whether CDR, as currently conceived, will be sufficient to affordably compensate for lack of adequate emissions reductions. To ensure CDR adequacy and maximize cost-effectiveness, additions to the R&D portfolio need to be considered. For example, in the case of negative-emissions energy, the focus of the NASEM report, and of those preceding it (for example, refs. 3\u20135), on biomass energy with carbon-capture and storage ignores the potential for other energy and capture modalities (for example, refs. 6\u20138). Mineral carbonation is featured as a potentially high-capacity solution, but is unnecessarily limited by only considering the formation of solid carbonates rather than also including the more carbon-efficient production of bicarbonates9. Enhancing the uptake and storage of CO2 by plants and soils plays a dominant role in NASEM\u2019s report and others2\u20135, yet only considering land-ecosystems ignores the large potential for marine taxa to contribute10. Likewise, the CDR prospects of, potentially, far more efficient approaches using genetic engineering (of microorganisms), synthetic biology, artificial photosynthesis and other avenues (for example, refs. 11\u201314) go unmentioned. While, \u201cThe committee recognizes that oceanic options for CO2 removal and sequestration...could sequester an enormous amount of CO2 and that the United States needs a research strategy to address them\u201d2, no marine options are detailed in the report, nor in its recommended R&D budget. This conforms to the report committee\u2019s guiding Statement of Task that specifically excluded marine options, with the curious exception of shore-based ecosystems (Blue Carbon), whose CDR potential is shown to be very small2,10. Thus, rather than being a CDR agenda that seeks to maximize global opportunities, it is one that excludes 70% of the planet. During the committee\u2019s deliberations, written concerns about its narrow focus were submitted to the NASEM by United States Senators Whitehouse and Heitkamp15, and by myself, but were apparently too late to affect the outcome. Rather than placing great hope only on the possibility of reducing costs and/or expanding the capacity of currently known and favoured approaches, the emergence of new or hybrid CDR methods also needs to be anticipated. If the evolution of modern technologies is any guide, the trajectory of an immature technology like CDR can change overnight and most certainly over years. An effective CDR R&D strategy must, therefore, have the foresight and nimbleness to support productive technology \u2018disruption\u2019. So, in the race to find and develop highcapacity, cost-effective, socially acceptable CDR, the contest not only needs to test and evaluate current frontrunners, but must also encourage additional, worthy contenders. The allocation of R&D resources within and across approaches also needs to be continually evaluated and adjusted based on objective and transparent intercomparisons of R&D results that include economic, social and ethical dimensions. In this way the evolution of CDR can be optimized so as to ensure that it can adequately contribute to solving an urgent global problem. \u2750", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "599f5fd56a85b98a8047385cbb4efd26d9c22a06", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2735365821", "PubMedCentral": "5509570", "DOI": "10.1186/s13021-017-0083-z", "CorpusId": 34774352, "PubMed": "28707260"}, "title": "Historical effects of dissolved organic carbon export and land management decisions on the watershed-scale forest carbon budget of a coastal British Columbia Douglas-fir-dominated landscape", "abstract": "BackgroundTo address how natural disturbance, forest harvest, and deforestation from reservoir creation affect landscape-level carbon (C) budgets, a retrospective C budget for the 8500\u00a0ha Sooke Lake Watershed (SLW) from 1911 to 2012 was developed using historical spatial inventory and disturbance data. To simulate forest C dynamics, data was input into a spatially-explicit version of the Carbon Budget Model-Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3). Transfers of terrestrial C to inland aquatic environments need to be considered to better capture the watershed scale C balance. Using dissolved organic C (DOC) and stream flow measurements from three SLW catchments, DOC load into the reservoir was derived for a 17-year period. C stocks and stock changes between a baseline and two alternative management scenarios were compared to understand the relative impact of successive reservoir expansions and sustained harvest activity over the 100-year period.ResultsDissolved organic C flux for the three catchments ranged from 0.017 to 0.057\u00a0Mg\u00a0C\u00a0ha\u22121\u00a0year\u22121. Constraining CBM-CFS3 to observed DOC loads required parameterization of humified soil C losses of 2.5, 5.5, and 6.5%. Scaled to the watershed and assuming none of the exported terrestrial DOC was respired to CO2, we hypothesize that over 100\u00a0years up to 30,657\u00a0Mg\u00a0C may have been available for sequestration in sediment. By 2012, deforestation due to reservoir creation/expansion resulted in the watershed forest lands sequestering 14\u00a0Mg\u00a0C\u00a0ha\u22121 less than without reservoir expansion. Sustained harvest activity had a substantially greater impact, reducing forest C stores by 93\u00a0Mg\u00a0C\u00a0ha\u22121 by 2012. However approximately half of the C exported as merchantable wood during logging (~176,000\u00a0Mg\u00a0C) may remain in harvested wood products, reducing the cumulative impact of forestry activity from 93 to 71\u00a0Mg\u00a0C\u00a0ha\u22121.ConclusionsDissolved organic C flux from temperate forest ecosystems is a small but persistent C flux which may have long term implications for C storage in inland aquatic systems. This is a first step integrating fluvial transport of C into a forest carbon model by parameterizing DOC flux from soil C pools.

In following its commitments to the Paris Agreement and in pursuit of near-zero emissions from power plants, China has actively moved towards high efficiency, low emission (HELE) coal-fired power plants. However, HELE technology alone cannot completely cut carbon emissions, and will require a mature CO2 emissions reduction technology such as carbon capture and storage (CCS) to significantly reduce the CO2 emissions within short to medium term.

We carry out this preliminary analysis through mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) framework, and by using publicly available power generation and carbon pricing data. Based on hypothetical scenarios, a HELE coal-fired power plant is found to contribute 55 % profit by selling the electricity.

The organism has a flexible metabolism and can perform a mixed-acid fermentation under anaerobic conditions. Under these conditions E. coli synthesises a formate hydrogenlyase isoenzyme (FHL-1) that can generate molecular hydrogen and carbon dioxide from formic acid. The reverse reaction is hydrogen-dependent carbon dioxide reduction (HDCR), which has exciting possibilities in bio-based carbon capture and storage if it can be harnessed. In this study, an E. coli host strain was optimised for the production of formate from H2 and CO2 during bacterial growth in a pressurised batch bioreactor. A host strain was engineered that constitutively produced the FHL-1 enzyme and incorporation of tungsten in to the enzyme, in place of molybdenum, helped poise the reaction in the HDCR direction. The engineered E. coli strain showed an ability to grow under fermentative conditions while simultaneously producing formate from gaseous H2 and CO2 supplied in the bioreactor. However, while a sustained pressure of 10 bar N2 had no adverse effect on cell growth, when the culture was placed at or above 4 bar pressure of a H2:CO2 mixture then a clear growth deficiency was observed.

This research focuses on strategies to reduce CO2 emissions from energy systems in the context of the process industries. In the process industries, energy systems consume fuel to generate steam and power for site process units. Improving energy efficiency can reduce costs of energy generation and use, as well as CO2 emissions. This research develops an integrated design and optimisation methodology for energy systems, allowing effective capture and control of carbon dioxide emissions. The first focus of this study is to develop a systematic approach to evaluate combinatorial strategies for reducing CO2 emissions, based on a techno-economic analysis. A conceptual design procedure with hierarchical decision-making is introduced to combine CO2 emissions reduction strategies, accounting for interactions between site components, including the heat exchanger network and utility system. CO2 emissions reduction options considered in development of this procedure include process integration techniques for improving the energy efficiency of the site and fuel switching. The proposed approach considers trade-offs between the economy of energy retrofit and CO2 emissions penalties. Opportunity for reducing the CO2 penalty is included in the economic evaluation of the combined emissions reduction strategies. A mathematical model for simultaneous optimization of emissions reduction strategies is developed. In addition to emissions reduction strategies, options for trading CO2 allowances are considered in the model. The proposed mathematical method applies Mixed Integer Non Linear Programming (MINLP) optimization, which employs a superstructure of the strategies for CO2 reduction. The proposed mathematical model relates the selected options to their operating and capital costs and to their associated CO2 emissions, allowing the optimizer to search for the optimal combination of emissions reduction strategies. While the reduction in CO2 emissions through process integration techniques is based on the existing configuration of a site and the associated structural limitations, integration of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies can provide greater mitigation of CO2 emissions from a site. However, important challenges of implementing CCS in the process industries are the energetic and economic impact of the CCS plant on the integrated site. In the second part of this study, these energy-economic issues are explored. The CCS technologies addressed in this thesis include post- and pre-combustion CO2 capture techniques. Simulation of each capture technique is carried out in process simulation software to characterize the energy performance of the CO2 capture plant. Sensitivity analyses are carried out for key parameters of the CO2 capture plant. The relationship between these key parameters and the energy balance of the capture plant is represented using a simple energy performance model for the CO2 capture plant. This model allows the integration of the CO2 capture plant with the site utility system to be explored. Interactions between the utility system and CO2 capture plant are considered. The site utility system, together with the CO2 capture plant, is optimized for minimum operating cost. The proposed procedures are illustrated by application to a case study of a medium-scale oil refinery. The results illustrate that to reduce CO2 emissions, heat integration, utility system optimization and fuel switching provide more cost-effective solutions than integrating CCS technologies. The mathematical model allows more cost-effective solutions to be identified than using sequential, conceptual methods, but the value of the conceptual method for developing insights is also illustrated. The results demonstrate that, depending on the potential of the site for increasing heat recovery and the type of fuel used on site, solutions that combine energy efficiency and fuel switching can provide up to 40% reduction in site CO2 emissions. Integrating a post-combustion CO2 capture plant with the site utility system can provide up to 90 mol% pure CO2 for sequestration; however, the high capital cost of the capture plant reduces the economic performance of the integrated site. The high heat demand of post-combustion CO2 capture for solvent regeneration increases the fuel consumption of the site and its utility system, which in turn reduces the recovery of CO2. The results reveal that pre-combustion CO2 capture can provide opportunities for heat and power generation to improve the techno-economic performance of the overall integrated site.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "656dbfa23c00fbd0c1e2c32eb722986040c24951", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2895990894", "DOI": "10.2118/192059-MS", "CorpusId": 134408331}, "title": "A Review of Recent Advances in Cost-Effective Infrastructure System Design of the CO2 Distribution to CCS Injection Wells", "abstract": "\n CO2 transport from capture sources to storage sites is one of the leading parts of the carbon capture, and storage (CCS) infrastructure that needs to be optimized in order to reduce the capital, operating and maintenance (O&M) costs. This paper conducts a systematic overview of CO2 transport and identifies the knowledge gaps with a view for application to optimal CCS Hub design. The findings show that much research has been focused on the engineering and economic consequences in pure CO2 streams while in most real field studies the captured CO2 is accompanied with trace impurities that can affect the \"intelligent\" cost model's confidence to estimate CO2 pipeline costs. The impacts of different topographical conditions in current models on the economic pressure drop and inlet pressure is another challenge that has received little attention in the literature. Most cost-effective pipeline systems described in the literature, are based on the simple point-to-point design while the capture of CO2 from multiple sources and transport to multiple distributed CCS injection wells is an issue for the industrial-scale rollout of CCS. The lack of sufficient studies on the flow variations within CO2 networks is the last discussion in this research review. Further, there have been several cost models reported in the literature, and most of them are based on the costs of the natural gas pipeline infrastructure. However, the higher operating pressure of CO2 and the various impurities in CO2 streams from capture plant may require construction material specifications that will affect cost models. A systematic understanding of how CO2 pipelines contribute to CCS chain economics is still lacking. While many optimization challenges have been solved for natural gas pipeline networks, there are different thermodynamic behaviors for CO2 that require further optimization. The potential minor impurities that could occur in CO2 pipelines such as water (H2O), nitrogen (N2), oxygen (O2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and methane (CH4) can add complexity compared to the transport of natural gas.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "a639feddda4ad7f81da3aaa7e2477d356a0f9807", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2896034283", "DOI": "10.18280/mmc_b.860105", "CorpusId": 135036325}, "title": "Correlative comparison of gas CO2 pipeline transportation and natural gas pipeline transportation", "abstract": "Carbon capture, utilization and storage technology (CCUS) is considered to be one of the most important technical pathways for greenhouse gas emission reduction.

Because of the differences of physical properties between CO2 and natural gas, there are many problems in pipeline design. This paper makes a comparative analysis of CO2 and natural gas related physical properties and transport parameters in china. The results showed that compared with natural gas, CO2 has a mutation in the density, viscosity, heat capacity and liable to phase changes, so the temperature and pressure in the process of conveying should be strictly controlled. At the same time, compared with natural gas, the explosion of CO2 is relatively safe, but the CO2 has strong corrosion at the existence of water, so in the design of CO2 pipeline the difference of the safety level and corrosion should be considered. Under the same conditions, the gas phase transport of CO2 mixture is more likely to generate hydrate than natural gas.

At high temperatures, alkaline fluids have been shown to rapidly react with bentonite clays, resulting in dissolution of bentonite after formation of calcium silicate hydrate and calcium-aluminium silicate hydrate mineral phases. Reaction rates decrease exponentially with decreasing temperature and become very low at pH<10.5. Modelling suggests that alkaline dissolution and subsequent precipitation of minerals are likely to occur in approximately similar quantities. These reactions, though initially decreasing permeability, may ultimately lead to a degradation of the clay structure and thus an increase in permeability. The objective of this work was to predict the life times of existing clay liners from detailed analysis of the integrity of cores collected from a reside storage area. Four cores sampled from a clay liner of a storage impoundment at an Alcoa location were examined. The clay liner had been exposed, at the time of sampling, to bauxite residue for periods of 20-23 years. Profile distributions in the cores of alkalinity, Na, Cl and Br were measured and compared with results obtained by numerically simulating the transport of Na. Linear extrapolation in time of profile distributions of alkalinity and Na suggests, that in the absence of a reduction in alkalinity (which occurs as a result of the reaction of the leachate with clay) times for breakthrough of leachate through the clay liner may be of the order of 30 to 70 years in the absence of hydraulic head reduction. However, a considerable amount of alkalinity is removed from solution after reaction with clay minerals and is not readily exchangeable. The \u2018on-going\u2019 reaction of alkaline residue leachate with clay progressively slows its movement in a non-linear fashion. Resulting \u2018breakthrough times\u2019 of residue leachate through clay liners are thus likely to be greater than estimated from a linear extrapolation in time of the profile distributions in cores. The outcome of this work has resulted in Alcoa developing methods for the reduction of hydraulic heads in residue areas where breakthrough may be a risk. Over the last decade, Alcoa has also taken several steps to enhance containment of residue leachate in new residue facilities, including the use of geomembrane-clay composite seals and the newly developed Carbon Capture process which significantly lowers the pH of residue leachate.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "2855ed6cd899ad33ade00fe2b438a1d97aafb938", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2559760408", "CorpusId": 132738068}, "title": "Diversidad funcional de bosques muy h\u00famedos tropicales en el noreste de Costa Rica a partir de rasgos foliares y densidad de la madera", "abstract": "Tropical wet forests are characterized by their high species diversity and a high level of complexity in the ecosystem processes taking place there.

Six ethanol hybrid buses were operating in regular public transport between June 2009 and June 2010. During this period the buses were operating at three different suburban routes. The purpose was to accumulate experimental data and to validate the robustness of the ethanol hybrid system and its components. In addition, in order to obtain comparable data, standardized duty cycle tests were performed. Furthermore, with the objective to assemble experimental data during heavy traffic and low mean velocity conditions, two urban routes were selected for staged tests with one ethanol hybrid bus.The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the energy efficiency of the electrified driveline and hybrid components of the Scania ethanol hybrid bus based on experimental data.The bus is a series hybrid vehicle with regenerative braking. A start/stop software to avoid idling was optional. The key components of a series hybrid are internal combustion engine, generator, energy storage, electric engine and resistor. The energy storage was commercially available super capacitors. The components of the electric powertrain were developed and delivered by Voith Turbo. A bus with identical exterior properties, an ethanol internal combustion engine coupled to a conventional automatic gearbox but without a hybrid system was used as a reference throughout the project. The measurement equipment was installed in the hybrid system to capture energy flows in and out of key components. Parallel logging of GPS coordinates generated a velocity profile which coupled with energy flow data constitute to the foundation of the analysis.The main results are presented as Sankey diagrams visualizing the energy flow through the electrified powertrain and determines the energy efficiency for each of the different traffic situations. The initial experimental results indicate that the reduction of fuel consumption benefits from routes with low mean velocity and a high number of stop.

Larvae demonstrated greater tolerance to elevated pCO2, showing no significant changes in survival, developmental time, morphology, and mineralisation, although they underwent intense metabolomic reprogramming. Conversely, juveniles showed the inverse pattern, with a reduction in survival and an increase in development time at the highest pCO2 levels tested, with no indication of metabolomic reprogramming.

In Part I (Chapters 1 and 2), the authors focus on a description of the social context of biomass use as an energy source (Chapter 1). They explain that there are three approaches to sustainable energy supply: (i) efficiency and savings, (ii) clean fossil fuels and nuclear energy with carbon capture and storage, and (iii) renewable energy sources. For the preparation of this book, the authors focused their attention on the latter approach. Then, in the second chapter, they introduce the main physicochemical characteristics of biomass and briefly discuss some characterization techniques. In Part II (Chapters 3\u20137), the authors introduce chemical engineering principles in relation to biomass processing (Chapters 3\u20136). They concentrate on topics such as material and energy balance, heat and mass transfer, thermodynamics, kinetics, and reactor design. The authors succeed in explaining the connection between chemical engineering principles and biomass processing. They achieve it by combining general chemical engineering knowledge with examples oriented to biomass processing. Then, in Chapter 7, the authors introduce a hierarchical approach to decision making in conceptual process design (CPD). This topic is presented in a general form; thus, it can be used as a general guide for CPD. In Part III (Chapters 8\u201315), the authors discuss technologies for biomass conversion, from physical pretreatment of raw biomass material to thermochemical conversion, biochemical conversion, and biorefinery integration. They also provide a framework to carry out economic evaluations of bio-based processes, and they show examples that clearly illustrate how to perform them. In Part IV (Chapters 16\u201318), the authors draw attention to end uses of biomass and economic analysis. The authors reflect on the use of solid oxide fuel cells as an option for decentralized power generation. Then, they analyze and compare the transformation of biomass into transportation fuels, such as synthetic natural gas, hydrocarbons (Fischer-Tropsch, FT), methanol, and dimethyl ether. They conclude that there is no clear agreement about the most valuable route. Surprisingly, a clear comparison between FT and methanol-to-gasoline synthesis for the production of liquid fuels is not included. In conclusion, this book is very rich in technical content, both theoretical and practical. The authors present a great variety of examples and figures, with clear and detailed descriptions, which contributes to an easy understanding of the content. Also, each chapter includes a list of acronyms and symbols used, which provides the reader a simple tool to rapidly understand all the symbology shown. Additionally, this book has a great amount of references that allow the reader to dig further in any specific topic. The language used is clear, and the material is enjoyable and easy to read. In my opinion, this book is valuable for undergraduates, postgraduates, and professionals with interest in the use of biomass as an energy source. The inclusion of chemical engineering principles and their connection to biomass processing and use (Part III) represent an important contribution of this book to current literature, a link that is sometimes forgotten.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "d3b4a04f0ee97fb37997d9559a4a60f7d797226e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2997876692", "DOI": "10.1190/tle39010038.1", "CorpusId": 210939449}, "title": "Reservoir and sealing properties of the Newark rift basin formations: Implications for carbon sequestration", "abstract": "The Newark Basin is one of the major Mesozoic rift basins along the U.S. Atlantic coast evaluated for carbon dioxide (CO2) storage potential.

Select samples from the basal, predominantly fluvial, Stockton Formation are characterized by relatively high porosity (8%\u201318%) and air permeability (0.1\u201350 mD), but borehole hydraulic tests suggest negligible transmissivity even in the high-porosity intervals, emphasizing the importance of scale in evaluating reservoir properties of heterogeneous formations. A stratigraphic hole drilled by TriCarb Consortium for Carbon Sequestration in the northern basin also intersected numerous sandstone layers in the predominantly lacustrine Passaic Formation, characterized by core porosity and permeability up to 18% and 2000 mD. However, those layers are shallow (predominantly above 1 km in this part of the basin) and lack prominent caprock layers above.

The igneous options are represented by basalt lavas, with porous flow tops and massive flow interiors, and a crystalline but often densely fractured Palisade Sill. The Newark Basin basalts may be too shallow for sequestration over most of the basin\u2019s area, but many other basalt flows exist in similar rift basins. Abundant fractures in sedimentary and igneous rocks are predominantly closed and/or sealed by mineralization, but stress indicators suggest high horizontal compressional stresses and strong potential for reactivation. Overall, the basin potential for CO2 storage appears low, but select formation properties are promising and could be investigated in the Newark Basin or other Mesozoic rift basins with similar fill but a different structural architecture. Introduction As anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) continue to grow, the need to mitigate their negative effects on Earth\u2019s climate becomes more and more pressing. Most energy technology evaluations agree that carbon capture, utilization, and storage should be part of a global solution for CO2 emission reduction (e.g., IEA, 2018; IPCC, 2018). A diverse portfolio of potential sites for geologic CO2 storage is needed to achieve the necessary storage volumes and efficiency and to reduce operational costs (e.g., Aydin et al., 2010; Levine et al., 2016; Rodosta et al., 2017). Here, we report the results of evaluating reservoir and N. V. Zakharova1,2, D. S. Goldberg2, P. E. Olsen2, D. Collins3, and D. V. Kent2,4 sealing properties of the Mesozoic Newark rift basin, located in the northeastern United States. The site lies in close proximity to many CO2 sources, such as large industrial plants, oil refineries, and fossil-fuel-based electric generating facilities in New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania (Figure 1). The Newark Basin is one of the largest exposed rift basins along the U.S. Atlantic coast, which were formed during the breakup of Pangaea in Late Triassic-Early Jurassic (Olsen et al., 1989; Withjack et al., 2013). The basin fill consists of fluvial and lacustrine sedimentary rocks and intrusive and extrusive basaltic rocks belonging to the Central Atlantic magmatic province (CAMP) (Figure 1). This geologic setting offers an opportunity to evaluate both the conventional sedimentary features, such as basal fluvial sandstones, and more exploratory options for CO2 storage, such as basic igneous rocks. The latter are highly reactive with CO2 and could help to permanently sequester anthropogenic CO2 through carbonation (e.g., McGrail et al., 2016; Pogge von Strandmann et al., 2019). Material presented in this paper draws on multiple projects conducted in the Newark Basin over more than 20 years of research and aims at synthesizing results relevant to evaluating the CO2 storage potential of the Newark Basin formations. One of the earliest and most significant scientific drilling campaigns was the Newark Basin Coring Project (NBCP) in the 1990s, which collected more than 6700 m of core spanning the full stratigraphic section of the basin along with standard well logging data (Goldberg et al., 1994; Kent et al., 1995; Olsen et al., 1996). Many subsequent studies utilized this core collection, drilled from seven stratigraphically offset holes in the central part of the basin (Figure 1c). More recently, the TriCarb Consortium for Carbon Sequestration (TriCarb) collected new seismic data and drilled a deep stratigraphic hole in the northern part of the basin, with some limited coring and extensive state-of-the-art well logging, specifically for evaluating Newark Basin\u2019s CO2 storage potential (Collins, 2017) (Figure 3). A shorter core hole was also drilled in the northern part of the basin penetrating the main igneous body, the Palisade Sill, the basal sandstones, and reaching basement. The TriCarb study was followed by a narrower geomechanical study of the Newark Basin formations, and petrophysical results from this project are also incorporated in the paper. Finally, core analysis is complemented by the results of hydrogeologic tests performed in two shallow test wells on the campus of Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University (Goldberg and Burgdorff, 2005; Matter et al., 2006; Zakharova et al., 2016). 1Central Michigan University, Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Mount Pleasant, Michigan, USA.

This information makes it possible to draw some preliminary conclusions on the suitability of the Newark Basin for geologic CO2 storage and highlights issues that need to be addressed in the studies of Mesozoic rift basins for carbon sequestration (Table 1). Basin structure and potential CO2 storage targets The Newark Basin is an elongated half-graben rift basin encompassing an area of more than 7510 km2 in southeastern New York, northern New Jersey, and southeastern Pennsylvania (Figure 1). The strata generally are dipping northwest toward the border fault system at about 10\u00b0 from horizontal and are overlapping crystalline basement on the eastern side. Several intrabasinal faults exist, predominantly northeast-striking normal faults synthetic to the border fault system (e.g., Schlische, 1992). The Late Triassic basin sediments are subdivided based on lithostratigraphy into the predominantly fluvial Stockton Formation, predominantly deep-lake lacustrine Lockatong Formation, and predominantly red-bed lacustrine Passaic Formation (Figure 2) (Olsen et al., 1996). The three major formations are overlain by a series of thinner basalt flows interbedded with fluvio-lacustrine sedimentary formations of latest Triassic-Early Jurassic age, which are preserved in a relatively small northwestern area of the basin adjacent to the border fault (Figure 1c). The intrusive Palisade Sill occurs at different depths and stratigraphic levels at different locations. As the most recent seismic data by TriCarb illustrate (Figure 1d), the sill, at least in the northern part of the basin, forms a continuous body across the basin and is often discordant to bedding. The coarse-grained Stockton Formation, which makes up the basal formation in the Newark Basin, has been identified as the primary target for CO2 storage (Collins, 2017). It consists of mostly buff and red conglomerate; buff, white, and gray arkose; and red Table 1. Summary of reservoir and sealing properties of major Newark Basin formations.

In this paper, we investigate the sequestration of CO2 in aquifers with the co-injection of surfactants for foam generation, to allow increased storage capacity. This is equivalent to the use of foam for conformance control in enhanced oil recovery applications. To study foam-assisted sequestration, we extend an in-house streamline-based simulator. We use two foam models: Hirasaki and Lawson (1985) and Rossen et al. (1999). In both models foam hinders gas mobility through increasing its apparent viscosity. The modified simulator is validated by comparison to analytical solutions. We then investigate the performance of CO2 sequestration with the co-injection of surfactants. We look at CO2 sequestration in a North Sea aquifer. We study both simultaneous and alternating surfactant-gas injection at different fractional flows (i.e. water:gas ratios). For cases where a seal provides a reliable trapping mechanism, the simulation results suggest that the use of surfactants to generate foam significantly improves the storage efficiency at a marginal increase in water consumption. In this setting, CO2/surfactant simultaneous injection at a 0.5 CO2 fractional flow was found to be the optimum injection strategy for the case investigated. If the seal is unreliable or absent, CO2/brine simultaneous injection at a 0.85 CO2 fractional flow was found to be the optimum injection strategy. Although foam-assisted sequestration in this case furthers improve the storage efficiency, it does so at a significant increase in water consumption. This is since, although foam generation improves the sweep during the sequestration phase, it significantly hinders the sweep during the chase brine injection phase. Based on that, having a design where the surfactant will degrade just before or during the chase brine injection phase would provide the optimum sequestration strategy\u2014without reliance on the presence or integrity of the seal.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "c1649fdad010324b31cd5c7a2a10f0afe558bc50", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s10973-022-11207-9", "CorpusId": 246211313}, "title": "Thermal analysis of MgFe-Cl Layered doubled hydroxide (LDH) directly synthetized and produced \u201cvia memory effect\u201d", "abstract": "Layered doubled hydroxides (LDHs) are known to be an interesting class of 2D layered materials, with a wide range of possible composition and a flexible structure suitable for topochemical reactions.
