Hydrate as a technology can be of immense importance for various industrial processes, such as multicomponent natural gas separation, gas storage and transportation, and carbon dioxide capture from flue gases and sequestration. A variety of hydrate additives, which includes promoters (thermodynamics and kinetics) and porous media, are being researched to improve the hydrate formation kinetics. However, studies involving the combinations of these are rare in the open literature. In this work, the formation kinetics of methane hydrate/semiclathrate hydrate using tetra-n-butyl ammonium bromide (TBAB) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) aqueous solutions at various concentrations in a porous medium containing silica sand at initial hydrate formation pressures (7.5 and 5.5 MPa) and temperatures (273.65 and 276.15 K) have been investigated. All the experiments were conducted using 75% water saturation. Various kinetics parameters, such as gas uptake, gas-to-hydrate conversion, and induction time, have been reported.

The success of CCS as a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy depends on the regulatory framework established to govern its deployment. Several initiatives have been undertaken and are underway to address deficiencies through regulatory working groups and by incorporating a regulatory component within current and planned CCS projects. This paper is part of the efforts initiated by the International Risk Governance Council (IRGC) which outlines the attributes that an effective regulatory regime for CCS should posses. Thorough examination of the national and international laws to determine how they should be adjusted to clarify the definition of CO 2 including impurities is necessary. As access and property right is the issue of national and international laws and also influences liability, they must be clearly defined. Monitoring and Verification plays an important role in outlining the legal frameworks for CCS and should be based on performance modelling coupled with risk assessment approach for both the short-term (life span of the project) and long-term (certain years after closure) periods. We advocate that long-term be defined as the time after the operational stage (short-term) with certain years after closure based on outputs from performance prediction. There is a need to address especially the long-term liability issues regardless of whether these are environment, in situ, or trans-border. To establish an internationally agreed guiding framework for CCS deployment we propose that legal and regulatory frameworks take into account the technical aspects with respect to the geological storage options including the issues that can arise in geological storage of CO 2.

The emphasis is on making Fischer-Tropsch liquids, with comparisons to cellulosic ethanol. Particular attention is given to exploitation of the negative CO2 emissions potential of CO2 capture and storage for bioenergy systems. One Fischer-Tropsch option involves coprocessing biomass and coal. All liquid fuel production options involve production of electricity as a net coproduct. Both CO2 aquifer storage and CO2 enhanced oil recovery options are analyzed. The metrics by which the alternatives are compared are: (i) the net greenhouse gas emission rate associated with liquid fuel production and use, (ii) the specific capital cost of liquid fuel production, (iii) the lifecycle cost calculated for a fixed capital charge rate, and (iv) the internal rate of return on equity as a function of both the crude oil price and the price of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, for options that involve biomass, liquid fuel yields per tonne of biomass are compared. And for enhanced oil recovery applications of the captured CO2, the relative profitability of using CO2 from synfuel plants and integrated gasifier combined cycle power plants is explored. Introduction Synthetic fuels derived from secure domestic resources have attracted wide interest recently in light of high oil prices and oil supply insecurity concerns. Here carbon management options are investigated for the production and use of synthetic liquid fuels derived from coal and biomass. The emphasis is on making synthetic diesel and gasoline via the Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) process. Commercially established F-T technology offers synfuels that are inherently cleaner than the diesel or gasoline fuels derived from crude oil that they would displace and with which they can be blended and thus introduced into transportation fuel markets with no change in infrastructure. Comparisons to cellulosic ethanol derived from biomass are made. The attractions of coal are its abundant availability from secure sources and its low and stable prices. The major concerns about a large coal synfuels program are its potential adverse impacts on climate, and coal mining health and safety and environmental risks associated with expanded coal production. The attractions of biomass are: (i) security of supply (as for coal), (ii) the potential for phasing out subsidies now paid to farmers for producing less food to the extent that they might otherwise earn a livelihood growing biomass for energy, (iii) its renewability as an energy resource, and, perhaps most importantly, (iv) its climate-change mitigation benefits. Because the CO2 emitted from bioenergy combustion is of recent photosynthetic origin, there is no net buildup of atmospheric CO2 if the biomass is produced on a sustainable basis. Moreover, by capturing and storing below ground some CO2 from biomass during its conversion to fuel or electricity, biomass becomes a negative CO2-emitting energy supply; such negative CO2 emissions can be used to offset GHG emissions from difficult-to-decarbonize fossil energy supplies, such as liquid fuels used in transportation. The major concerns about biomass are the typical high cost of biomass compared to coal, and the land intensity of biomass production (reflecting the low efficiency of photosynthesis) and resulting competition with alternative land uses.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "58b92c0a7f9617f02bb3d4ccd17341e52771b808", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2946594119", "DOI": "10.5296/JPAG.V9I2.14559", "CorpusId": 181899166}, "title": "Comparative International Law: The Scope and Management of Public Participation Rights Related to CCS Activities", "abstract": "The paper proposes the presentation of the public participation item in the regulatory standards of CCS in Australia, Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States and their possible relations with the Brazilian configuration.

To ensure the cathode is not fouled by deposition of the insulating metal carbonate, the process is operated under hydrogen evolution conditions thereby alleviating any significant attachment of the solid to the electrode.

CCS includes the capture of CO2 emissions from electricity generation plants and/or industrial processes, its transport (by pipeline or ships) and sequestration in underground reservoirs such as deep aquifers or depleted oil and gas fields. As a novel technology, CCS is an ideal case study for testing the Prosuite methodology. The sustainability is tested using the five end-points established in Prosuite: human health, natural environment, exhaustible resources, social well-being and prosperity. This case study uses the scope defined across WP3-5 of PROSUITE. The analysis is undertaken in a prospective framework for the year 2030 under the economic scenarios developed in WP2, which themselves are based on the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives. A key component of the scenarios from WP2 relevant for the economic analysis of the CCS case is the inclusion of a cost of carbon, which in the main scenario investigated is taken from the BlueMap scenario of the IEA Energy Technology Perspectives. With the cost of carbon, coal fired power without carbon capture and storage is more expensive than coal fired power with carbon capture and storage and viceversa. The tax per kWh for the reference system is \u20ac0.07, which is markedly more than the tax of \u20ac0.02 for the prospective system. This is a result of the BLUE Map scenario assumption of a 110 $/t CO2 tax. In fact, CCS is only cheaper per functional unit when taxes (including a carbon tax) are included as an input. This indicates that that the technology is economically \u201cnon-sustainable\u201d in the sense that it cannot compete on costs with the reference technology when a carbon tax is not levied. For the scenario evaluated, key results can be summarized as follows: \uf0b7 Implementation of CCS results in lower impact on the human health indicator than in the reference scenario (without CCS). In both scenarios, the decrease is mainly driven by changes in the environmental human health indicator while the role of occupational health is minor. \uf0b7 Implementation of CCS results on a score on impacts on the natural environment that is 70% lower than the reference scenario. This is mainly due to the significant decrease on the climate change indicator which counteracts increases shown in other environmental indicators. \uf0b7 Implementation of CCS results on a significant increase in the impact on exhaustible resources, which is due to an increase on fossil depletion. The effect of metal depletion is negligible compared to the large amount of fossil depletion. \uf0b7 With a high tax (110 $/tonne Blue map scenario), as used in this study, applying CCS results in a marked increase in economic activity, when results are analysed at the technology level. The results also show a substantial increase in working hours per functional unit. However, the results also indicate that the producer price increase more than 80% when implementing CCS. \uf0b7 The results for social well-being indicate that in the scenario with CCS there is an increase in total employment and knowledge intensive jobs, and a decrease in income and global inequality. However, increases in child and forced labour are also observed. The qualitative indicators reveal that issues such as trust in risk information, long term control functions, stakeholder involvement can become bottlenecks for the deployment of the technology and need to be carefully addressed as part of project development and implementation \uf0b7 There is a large difference in order of magnitude in the end-points. This makes the integration of results troublesome. Until this problem is solved, it is recommended to assess the results without a formal aggregation methodology.

The most attractive potential aspect of oxyfuel coal combustion would be the ability to achieve a carbon capture and storage (CCS) system, which would be a \"quick-impact\" approach to reducing global CO 2 emissions.

As one of the most important parts, different gasification technologies can greatly influence the performance of the system. This paper develops a model to examine the feasibilities and advantages of using Ultra Superheated Steam (USS) gasification technology in IGCC power plant with carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS). USS gasification technology converts coal into syngas by the endothermic steam reforming reaction, and the heat required for this reaction is provided by the sensible heat in the ultra superheated steam. A burner utilizes synthetic air (21% O2 and 79% H2 O) to burn fuel gas to produce the USS flame for the gasification process. The syngas generated from USS gasification has a higher hydrogen fraction (more than 50%) then other gasification processes. This high ratio of hydrogen is considered to be desired for a \u201ccapture-ready\u201d IGCC plant. After gas cleanup and water gas shift reaction, the syngas goes to the Selexol process for carbon dioxide removal. Detailed calculations and analysis are performed to test the performance of USS gasification technology used in IGCC generation systems. Final results such as net output, efficiency penalty for CO2 capture part, and net thermal efficiency are calculated and compared when three different coal types are used. This paper uses published data of USS gasification from previous research at the University of North Dakota. The model also tries to treat the IGCC with carbon dioxide capture system as a whole thermal system, the superheated steam used in USS gasification can be provided by extracting steam from the lower pressure turbine in the Rankine Cycle. The model will make reasonable use of various waste energies and steams for both mechanical and chemical processes to improve the performance of the plant, and incorporate CO2 capture system into the design concept of the power plant.Copyright \u00a9 2008 by ASME", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "d1053e9ba5458fcdffbc03f2ddb2980137668ba7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2358963873", "CorpusId": 113141973}, "title": "Fault Tree Analysis for Risk Assessment of CO 2 Leakage from Geologic Storage", "abstract": "Abstract CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) is considered as the most promising interim solution todeal with the greenhouse gas such as CO 2 responsible for global warming.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) can be sequestered underground in oil and gas reservoirs, in deep saline aquifers, in uneconomic coal beds and in salt caverns. The Alberta Basin provides a very large capacity for CO2 storage in oil and gas reservoirs, along with significant capacity in deep saline formations and possible unmineable coal beds. Regional assessments of potential geological CO2 storage capacity have largely focused so far on estimating the total capacity that might be available within each type of reservoir. While deep saline formations are effectively able to accept CO2 immediately, the storage potential of other classes of candidate storage reservoirs, primarily oil and gas fields, is not fully available at present time. Capacity estimates to date have largely overlooked rates of depletion in these types of storage reservoirs and typically report the total estimated storage capacity that will be available upon depletion. However, CO2 storage will not (and cannot economically) begin until the recoverable oil and gas have been produced via traditional means. This report describes more\u00a0\u00bb a reevaluation of the CO2 storage capacity and an assessment of the timing of availability of the oil and gas pools in the Alberta Basin with very large storage capacity (>5 MtCO2 each) that are being looked at as likely targets for early implementation of CO2 storage in the region. Over 36,000 non-commingled (i.e., single) oil and gas pools were examined with effective CO2 storage capacities being individually estimated. For each pool, the life expectancy was estimated based on a combination of production decline analysis constrained by the remaining recoverable reserves and an assessment of economic viability, yielding an estimated depletion date, or year that it will be available for CO2 storage. The modeling framework and assumptions used to assess the impact of the timing of CO2 storage resource availability on the region\u2019s deployment of CCS technologies is also described. The purpose of this report is to describe the data and methodology for examining the carbon dioxide (CO2) storage capacity resource of a major hydrocarbon province incorporating estimated depletion dates for its oil and gas fields with the largest CO2 storage capacity. This allows the development of a projected timeline for CO2 storage availability across the basin and enables a more realistic examination of potential oil and gas field CO2 storage utilization by the region\u2019s large CO2 point sources. The Alberta Basin of western Canada was selected for this initial examination as a representative mature basin, and the development of capacity and depletion date estimates for the 227 largest oil and gas pools (with a total storage capacity of 4.7 GtCO2) is described, along with the impact on source-reservoir pairing and resulting CO2 transport and storage economics. The analysis indicates that timing of storage resource availability has a significant impact on the mix of storage reservoirs selected for utilization at a given time, and further confirms the value that all available reservoir types offer, providing important insights regarding CO2 storage implementation to this and other major oil and gas basins throughout North America and the rest of the world. For CCS technologies to deploy successfully and offer a meaningful contribution to climate change mitigation, CO2 storage reservoirs must be available not only where needed (preferably co-located with or near large concentrations of CO2 sources or emissions centers) but also when needed. The timing of CO2 storage resource availability is therefore an important factor to consider when assessing the real opportunities for CCS deployment in a given region. \u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "60aca5706a81d27257668f0cda752b5d4a4131f5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3133701981", "DOI": "10.3390/PR9030456", "CorpusId": 233775025}, "title": "Study of Amine Functionalized Mesoporous Carbon as CO2 Storage Materials", "abstract": "Carbon sequestration via the carbon capture and storage (CCS) method is one of the most useful methods of lowering CO2 emissions in the atmosphere.

This dissertation investigates the operational and economic feasibility of such future low-carbon power systems by simulating the Dutch and European power systems. Particular attention is paid to the impacts of intermittent renewable energy sources (iRES) on the power system, the operational and economic performance of power plants with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the flexibility of the power system. It is found that iRES affect the operation of power systems, but that their impacts are manageable. Overall, sufficient operational flexibility is available in future low-carbon power systems to accommodate variable electricity production of iRES and to supply the extra balancing reserves that are needed to compensate for the forecast error of iRES. Power systems will experience reduced capacity factors of dispatchable generators such as power plants. The efficiency of power plants is hardly reduced by iRES (simulations show efficiency reductions up to 0.3% in scenarios with up to 59% iRES penetration). Also, low-carbon power systems can be realized with various generation portfolios. A large share of power can be generated by either natural gas-fired combined cycle (NGCC) power plants with CCS, nuclear power, or renewable sources, in particular wind and solar power. A higher share of renewables may be better aligned with long-term climate targets up to 2100, but will be 12% more expensive in the year 2050 than deploying more natural-gas fired power plants. This price increase is caused by the higher investment costs of iRES, and \u201cintegration costs\u201d associated with integrating the intermittent electricity production in the system. The integration costs are largely caused by underutilization of dispatchable capacity, whose capacity factors are reduced. Balancing costs are also a minor component of the integration costs. Lastly, the roles of three generation portfolio components need to be pointed out: (1) Deployment of gas turbines is important to ensure system adequacy in systems with high shares of iRES; (2) Demand response is a promising flexibility option, but needs further research; (3) Deployment of wholesale electricity storage is not economic, and not essential for system reliability. In addition, necessary investments in power plants will not be made with the current energy-only market design because their business cases are unsound. New investments in power plants will be necessary to replace aging power plants and ensure system adequacy. The current energy-only market design does not provide sufficient revenues to warrant new investments, especially when peak prices are prevented by system reliability targets. The same pattern is observed at a power system level: total European power system costs are 38% - 85% higher than the revenues, so increased revenues are needed to maintain a reliable power system in the future. In addition, the large uncertainty in power plant business cases discourages investments. Future CO2 prices are very uncertain, which makes any business case unattractive.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "198bdb5fa86569fa8886c3f10a1ef8d627c40c32", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2900591866", "DOI": "10.17863/CAM.24830", "CorpusId": 139695463}, "title": "Carbon capture and storage: the way forward", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is broadly recognised as having the potential to play a key role in meeting climate change targets, delivering low carbon heat and power, decarbonising industry and, more recently, its ability to facilitate the net removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.

The formation of ionogels represents a promising approach; however, many earlier approaches suffer from solvent/matrix incompatibility, optical opacity, embrittlement, matrix-limited thermal stability, and/or inadequate ionic liquid loading. We offer a solution to these limitations by demonstrating a straightforward and effective strategy toward flexible and durable ionogels comprising bacterial cellulose supports hosting in excess of 99% ionic liquid by total weight. Termed bacterial cellulose ionogels (BCIGs), these gels are prepared using a facile solvent-exchange process equally amenable to water-miscible and water-immiscible ionic liquids. A suite of characterization tools were used to study the preliminary (thermo)physical and structural properties of BCIGs, including no-deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction. Our analyses reveal that the weblike structure and high crystallinity of the host bacterial cellulose microfibrils are retained within the BCIG. Notably, not only can BCIGs be tailored in terms of shape, thickness, and choice of ionic liquid, they can also be designed to host virtually any desired active, functional species, including fluorescent probes, nanoparticles (e.g., quantum dots, carbon nanotubes), and gas-capture reagents. In this paper, we also present results for fluorescent designer BCIG chemosensor films responsive to ammonia or hydrogen sulfide vapors on the basis of incorporating selective fluorogenic probes within the ionogels. Additionally, a thermometric BCIG hosting the excimer-forming fluorophore 1,3-bis(1-pyrenyl)propane was devised which exhibited a ratiometric (two-color) fluorescence output that responded precisely to changes in local temperature.

Soil N recoveries\nin simulations with closed N cycles were closer to observations in the short term\n(CLM5: 40\u00b110\u2009%; observations: 54\u00b122\u2009%) but smaller\nthan observations in the long term (CLM5: 59\u00b115\u2009%; observations:\n69\u00b118\u2009%). Simulations with open N cycles estimated similar\npatterns in plant and soil N recovery, except that soil N recovery was also\nsmaller than observations in the short term. In both open and closed sets of\nsimulations, soil N recoveries in CLM5 occurred from the cycling of N\nthrough plants rather than through direct immobilization in the soil, as is\noften indicated by tracer studies. Although CLM5 greatly overestimated plant\nN recovery, the simulated increase in C stocks to recovered N was not much\nlarger than estimated by observations, largely because the model's assumed\nC:N ratio for wood was nearly half that suggested by measurements at the\nfield sites.

Measurements of carbon isotope variations in climate archives and isotope-enabled climate\nmodeling advance the understanding of the carbon cycle.

To meet the challenges of nutrient limitation, microorganisms might: (i) allocate less carbon (C) to growth vs. respiration or excretion (i.e., flexible C-use efficiency, CUE), (ii) produce extracellular enzymes to target compounds that supply the most limiting element, (iii) modify their cellular composition according to the external nutrient availability, and (iv) preferentially retain nutrients at senescence. These four resource use modes can have different consequences on the litter C and nitrogen (N) dynamics\u2013modes that selectively remove C from the system can reduce C storage in soil, whereas modes that delay C mineralization and increase internal N recycling could promote storage of C and N. Since we do not know which modes are dominant in litter decomposers, we cannot predict the fate of C and N released from plant residues, in particular under conditions of microbial nutrient limitation. To address this question, we developed a process-based model of litter decomposition in which these four resource use modes were implemented. We then parameterized the model using \u223c80 litter decomposition datasets spanning a broad range of litter qualities. The calibrated model variants were able to capture most of the variability in litter C, N, and lignin fractions during decomposition regardless of which modes were included.

Most studies on carbon storage in marine ecosystems have focused on organic carbon, leaving inorganic carbon processes such as calcification unaccounted for, despite of their critical role in the global carbon budget. This is probably because of uncertainties regarding the role of calcification in marine carbon budgets as either atmospheric CO2 source or sink. Here, we conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the influence of a calcifying alga (Corallina officinalis L.) on seawater carbon content, using a non-calcifying alga (Ulva lactuca L.) as a control. In a first part, algae were incubated separately while measuring changes in seawater pH, total alkalinity (TA) and total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The amount of carbon used in photosynthetic uptake and production of CaCO3 was then calculated. In a second, directly following, part the algae were removed and DIC levels were allowed to equilibrate with air until the pH stabilized and the loss of CO2 to air was calculated as the difference in total DIC from the start of part one, to the end of the second part. The results showed that C. officinalis caused a significant and persistent reduction in total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), TA and seawater pH, while no such permanent changes were caused by U. lactuca. These findings indicate that calcification can release a significant amount of CO2 to the atmosphere and thereby possibly counteract the carbon sequestration in marine vegetated ecosystems if this CO2 is not re-fixed in the system.

Natural Gas and the Evolving U.S. Power Sector Monograph Series: Number 2", "abstract": "Natural gas generation in the U.S. electricity sector has grown substantially in recent years, while the sector's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have generally declined. This relationship highlights the concept of natural gas as a potential enabler of a transition to a lower-carbon future. This work considers that concept by using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) Renewable Energy Deployment System (ReEDS) model. ReEDS is a long-term capacity expansion model of the U.S. electricity sector. We examine the role of natural gas within the ReEDS modeling framework as increasingly strict carbon emission targets are imposed on the electricity sector. In addition to various natural gas price futures, we also consider scenarios that emphasize a low-carbon technology in order to better understand the role of natural gas if that low-carbon technology shows particular promise. Specifically, we consider scenarios with high amounts of energy efficiency (EE), low nuclear power costs, low renewable energy (RE) costs, and low carbon capture and storage (CCS) costs. Within these scenarios we find that requiring the electricity sector to lower CO2 emissions over time increases near-to-mid-term (through 2030) natural gas generation (see Figure 1 - left). The long-term (2050) role of natural gas generation in the electricity sectormore\u00a0\u00bb is dependent on the level of CO2 emission reduction required. Moderate reductions in long-term CO2 emissions have relatively little impact on long-term natural gas generation, while more stringent CO2 emission limits lower long-term natural gas generation (see Figure 1 - right). More stringent carbon targets also impact other generating technologies, with the scenarios considered here seeing significant decreases in coal generation, and new capacity of nuclear and renewable energy technologies over time. Figure 1 also demonstrates the role of natural gas in the context of scenarios where a specific low-carbon technology is advantaged. In 2030, natural gas generation in the technology scenarios is quite similar to that in the reference scenarios, indicating relatively little change in the role of natural gas in the near-to-mid-term due to advancements in those technology areas. The 2050 natural gas generation shows more significant differences, suggesting that technology advancements will likely have substantial impacts on the role of natural gas in the longer-term timeframe. Natural gas generation differences are most strongly driven by alternative natural gas price trajectories--changes in natural gas generation in the Low NG Price and High NG Price scenarios are much larger than in any other scenario in both the 2030 and 2050 timeframes. The only low-carbon technology scenarios that showed any increase in long-term natural gas generation relative to the reference case were the Low CCS cost scenarios. Carbon capture and storage technology costs are currently high, but have the potential to allow fossil fuels to play a larger role in low-carbon grid. This work considers three CCS cost trajectories for natural gas and coal generators: a baseline trajectory and two lower cost trajectories where CO2 capture costs reach $40/metric ton and $10/metric ton, respectively. We find that in the context of the ReEDS model and with these assumed cost trajectories, CCS can increase the long-term natural gas generation under a low carbon target (see Figure 2). Under less stringent carbon targets we do not see ReEDS electing to use CCS as part of its electricity generating portfolio for the scenarios considered in this work.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "520025fa591ad3d3550e6eb0b8bee241a835c9d0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2152794309", "CorpusId": 110963549}, "title": "Why and How the European Union Can Get a (Near To) Carbon-Free Energy System in 2050?", "abstract": "Reducing the European Union GHG emissions by at least 80% by 2050 will require a near zero carbon electricity, road and rail transport industry, and heating and cooling in buildings.

Several promising lignocellulosic crops are emerging that have no food role - fast-growing trees and grasses - but are well suited as bioenergy feedstocks, including Populus, Salix, Arundo, Miscanthus, Panicum and Sorghum.\n\n\nSCOPE\nThese promising crops remain largely undomesticated and, until recently, have had limited germplasm resources. In order to avoid competition with food crops for land and nature conservation, it is likely that future bioenergy crops will be grown on marginal land that is not needed for food production and is of poor quality and subject to drought stress. Thus, here we define an ideotype for drought tolerance that will enable biomass production to be maintained in the face of moderate drought stress. This includes traits that can readily be measured in wide populations of several hundred unique genotypes for genome-wide association studies, alongside traits that are informative but can only easily be assessed in limited numbers or training populations that may be more suitable for genomic selection. Phenotyping, not genotyping, is now the major bottleneck for progress, since in all lignocellulosic crops studied extensive use has been made of next-generation sequencing such that several thousand markers are now available and populations are emerging that will enable rapid progress for drought-tolerance breeding. The emergence of novel technologies for targeted genotyping by sequencing are particularly welcome. Genome editing has already been demonstrated for Populus and offers significant potential for rapid deployment of drought-tolerant crops through manipulation of ABA receptors, as demonstrated in Arabidopsis, with other gene targets yet to be tested.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nBioenergy is predicted to be the fastest-developing renewable energy over the coming decade and significant investment over the past decade has been made in developing genomic resources and in collecting wild germplasm from within the natural ranges of several tree and grass crops.

The polarity of their chemical structure in combination with an inherent porosity allows for adsorbing large amounts of carbon dioxide in combination with high selectivities over unpolar guest molecules such as methane and nitrogen. For this reason, among purely organic polymers, BILPs contain some of the most effective networks to date. Nevertheless, they are still outperformed by competitive materials such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) or metal doped porous polymers. Here, we report the synthesis of BILP-19 and its exceptional carbon dioxide uptake of up to 6 mmol\u00b7g\u22121 at 273 K, making the network comparable to state-of-the-art materials. BILP-19 precipitates in a particulate structure with a strongly anisotropic growth into platelets, indicating a sheet-like structure for the network. It exhibits only a small microporous but a remarkable ultra-microporous surface area of 144 m2\u00b7g\u22121 and 1325 m2\u00b7g\u22121, respectively. We attribute the exceptional uptake of small guest molecules such as carbon dioxide and water to the distinct ultra-microporosity. Additionally, a pronounced hysteresis for both guests is observed, which in combination with the platelet character is probably caused by an expansion of the interparticle space, creating additional accessible ultra-microporous pore volume. For nitrogen and methane, this effect does not occur which explains their low affinity. In consequence, Henry selectivities of 123 for CO2/N2 at 298 K and 12 for CO2/CH4 at 273 K were determined.

Using a two-box model allows the non-renewable aspects of the global carbon cycle to be accounted for and implies that carbon emissions have to decline at the ceiling due to the ongoing saturation of the ocean with respect to anthropogenic carbon. Convex sequestration costs result in a continuous use of such a technology and allow the ceiling to be reached later than without sequestration, whereas linear sequestration costs result in a discontinuous use of such a technology and earlier reaching of the ceiling. Consequently, taking into the account the uncertainties in defining an appropriate ceiling, the policy recommendations with respect to carbon sequestration differ crucially according to the underlying assumptions of sequestration costs.

Inexpensive electricity from coal has been a key component in building large industrial economies such as USA and China. But in recent decades the negative aspects of coal, mainly carbon dioxide emissions, has changed the view on the fuel. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a solution to be able to continue using coal as an energy source, while limiting carbon emissions. One of the drawbacks of CCS is the energy need associated with the capture process, the energy penalty. This study aims to gather and analyze the energy penalties for the most developed types of carbon capture technologies. It also aims to model how the implementation of CCS would affect the future coal consumption.The results show that the range of energy penalties for a given type of technology is wide. Despite obtaining the energy penalty with the same simulation software, the energy penalty for post- combustion with MEA can range between 10.7% and 39.1%. Comparing mean energy penalties show that pre-combustion capture is the most efficient capture method (18.4% \u00b1 4.4%) followed by oxy- fuel (21.6% \u00b1 5.5%) and post-combustion (24.7% \u00b1 7.9%).Further on, CCS implementation scenarios were compared and used as a starting point for coal consumption calculations. Three pathways were constructed in order to investigate how different distributions of technologies would affect the amount of needed coal. The pathways describe a implementation with only the most efficient technology, the least efficient and a middle option.The results suggest that a large scale implementation of CCS on coal power plant will have a significant impact on the global coal consumption. Under certain assumptions it takes up to 35 % more coal to deliver the same amount electricity with CCS in comparison without CCS. It is also found that certain implementation scenarios will struggle to produce the amount of coal that is needed to power the plants.A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the impact of assumptions made on for instance plant efficiencies.

It avoids current coal mining challenges such as drastic changes to landscapes, high machinery costs, elevated risks to personnel, and post-extraction transport. UCG has a huge potential to provide a clean coal energy source by implementing carbon capture and storage techniques as part of the process. In order to support mitigation strategies for clean coal production and policy development, much research needs to be completed. One component of this information is the need to understand what happens when the coal burns and a subsurface cavity is formed. This paper looks at the efforts to enhance reliable prediction of the size and shape of the cavities. Reactions are one of the most important mechanisms that control the rate of the growth of the cavities. Therefore, modeling the reactions and precise prediction of reaction kinetics can influence the accuracy of a UCG process. The produced syngas composition during UCG is closely linked to the reactions that take place in this process, the permeability of the coal seam, and the temperature distribution. Since the combination of reactions can influence the distributions of the heat and gas components in the coal seam during UCG or even extinguish the combustion, accurate modeling of the reactions is crucial, particularly when all phenomena affecting the reaction rate are considered in a single set of kinetics. In this study, procedures are proposed to estimate the frequency factor and activation energy of the pyrolysis reaction using a single-step decomposition method, the kinetics of the endothermic direction of homogeneous reversible reactions, and the frequency factor of heterogeneous reactions from experiments or literature data. The estimated kinetics is more appropriate for simulation of the UCG process using the porous medium approach.

CO2 emitted out to atmosphere from the power plants utilizing fossil fuels causes major environmental pollution. Hence incorporation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the need of the hour even though it increase the capital cost. Therefore a decision is to be made by the investing companies either to construct conventional power plants incorporating CCS or to go for non conventional energy sources that are environment friendly. This can be represented mathematically as a Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) problem. Energy Storage System (ESSs) helps in improving the reliability of the system satisfying the economic aspects as well. Also the use of Renewable Energy Technologies (RET) can meet this objective. In view of the complications and complexities involved in the GEP incorporating renewable energy sources with or without storage facility, the Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) also plays a significant role in the electric power system expansion planning.

Without decisive action, energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) will more than double by 2050 and increased oil demand will heighten concerns over the security of supplies. We can and must change our current path, but this will take an energy revolution and low-carbon energy technologies will have a crucial role to play. Energy efficiency, many types of renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and new transport technologies will all require widespread deployment if we are to reach our greenhouse-gas emission goals. Every major country and sector of the economy must be involved. The task is also urgent if we are to make sure that investment decisions taken now do not saddle us with sub-optimal technologies in the long term. There is a growing awareness of the urgent need to turn political statements and analytical work into concrete action. To spark this movement, at the request of the G8, the International Energy Agency (IEA) is developing a series of roadmaps for some of the most important technologies. These roadmaps provide solid analytical footing that enables the international community to move forward on specific technologies. Each roadmap develops a growth path for a particular technology from today to 2050, and identifies technology, financing, policy and public engagement milestones that need to be achieved to realise the technology's full \u2026", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "297570b3482c3034e758cf73a7bd24cd40a06f00", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2080663103", "DOI": "10.3763/CPOL.2007.0491.8.SUPP.S108", "CorpusId": 221021832}, "title": "Back-casting analysis for 70% emission reduction in Japan by 2050", "abstract": "This article envisions a future in which advances in technology and urban development have transformed Japanese society by 2050, resulting in significant greenhouse gas reductions. Pathways leading Japan towards a low-carbon society are calculated using a scenario approach based on 'back-casting' techniques. It is possible to reach a 70% reduction in CO 2 emissions through a combination of demand-side and supply-side actions. On the demand side, reductions of 40-45% are possible through efficiency improvements, decreased population and the more rational use of energy despite increased energy demands arising in certain sectors. On the supply side, CO 2 emissions can be reduced through a combination of the appropriate choice of low-carbon energy sources (including carbon capture and storage) and improving energy efficiency. The estimated direct annual cost of technology to achieve this by 2050 is 6.7-9.8 trillion yen, approximately 1% of the estimated 2050 GDP. However, this excludes costs involved in infrastructure investments with aims other than climate policy (e.g. strengthening international competitiveness, improving security, enhancing urban development, and reinforcing energy). To avoid investing in its current high-carbon-emitting infrastructure, Japan must develop long-term strategies to create the necessary technological and societal innovations and to channel the appropriate financial resources for intensive economy-wide change, such as development of land, urban areas, and buildings, improvements in industrial structures, and new technologies.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "43fb4ef182b8bc74adf2a96182f8b66e4fad0ab1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1978400779", "DOI": "10.1016/J.EGYPRO.2013.06.580", "CorpusId": 108572160}, "title": "The South African centre for carbon capture and storage delivering CCS in the developing world", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "bdf8289ac0b4235c4a12c7ad3cab5ae75a7c0253", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2202713104", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2015.07.019", "CorpusId": 97190995}, "title": "Detection of CO2 leaks from carbon capture and storage sites with combined atmospheric CO2 and O-2 measurements", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "f5d16acf51aa108475eb1aa6a19ba78d2e9c52a7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3160067499", "DOI": "10.1016/J.POLGEO.2021.102416", "CorpusId": 236331071}, "title": "Limits to climate action - Narratives of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "908c8148d550cfe933934f71a3844314a5a814f0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1974871367", "DOI": "10.1149/1.3242247", "CorpusId": 136732508}, "title": "Composite Ceramic Membranes for Oxygen Separation in Carbon Capture and Storage Systems", "abstract": null, "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "0ca04526c21105fb57510a31be0b565b1bcf92e1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2047807171", "DOI": "10.1007/S11708-010-0104-Z", "CorpusId": 97553656}, "title": "Modeling China\u2019s energy dilemma: conflicts among energy saving, energy security, and CO2 mitigation", "abstract": "This study analyzes China\u2019s future energy scenarios stretching until 2050 under different policy portfolios of energy security (e.g., oil import dependency) and CO2 emissions control.

This is in part due to lack of suitable equations for estimating tree biomass C for the many species growing under the more open-grown conditions in agroforestry and across the of the United States where windbreaks are used. We analyzed the accuracy of 25 allometric models to estimate biomass storage by 16 tree species (eight conifer and eight hardwood species) located in nine regions. The forms of these models were evaluated using destructively sampled Pinus ponderosa from field windbreaks. The Jenkins\u2019 et al (2003) model and two new models were the most promising. Using the Jenkins\u2019 model, we estimated the biomass stored for the 16 tree species and converted these values to C in windbreaks projected out to 50 years in nine continental United States regions. Carbon storage potential in the windbreak scenarios ranged from 1.07\u00b10.21 to 3.84\u00b10.04 Mg C ha year for conifers species and from 0.99\u00b10.16 to 13.6\u00b17.72 Mg C ha year during 50 years for hardwood species.

This article correlated value of income from different sources to energy sources used by agrarian households in Nigeria and drew implications for low carbon development in Africa. It analysis included use of wind power for irrigation purposes, harnessing solar energy for lightening and possible cost implications. Secondary data were collected from Community Based Monitoring System Nigeria Project. Descriptive statistics, correlation and qualitative analysis were employed. The average annual income of agrarian households from different sources such as crop farming, livestock farming, petty trading, forest exploitation, remittance and labour per day was below the poverty line of $1 per day. The source of energy that had the highest number of significant correlation was electrical energy (low carbon electrical energy).

the hybrid energy-economy-climate model ReMIND. ReMIND is an intertemporal optimization model that allows the analysis of long-term transitions of the global energy system under the constraint of an upper limit on global mean temperature change. The newly-implemented transport sector is modeled through explicit vehicle technologies, which are then aggregated by constant elasticity of substitution functions into transport modes. The transport sector is fully linked to the other energy sectors and interacts with them through resource prices, carbon prices and competition for investments. Our preliminary results strongly indicate that within our purely techno-economic modeling framework, the transport sector undergoes only little decarbonization while the other energy sectors strongly decarbonize to achieve the required 50% chance of keeping global warming below 2\u00b0C. The small transport decarbonization that can be observed is mostly achieved by a fuel switch to second-generation biofuels and compressed natural gas, and some modal shift towards train use. Under our default cost assumptions, new vehicle technologies like hybrid cars only achieve some market penetration around 2070, while battery-electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) never enter the market. The main reason that allows the model to stay below 2\u00b0C warming even though the transport sector is still heavily dependent on oil is the availability of secondgeneration biomass, which can be combined with carbon capture and storage to produce negative emissions. When testing the importance of biomass for the transport sector by reducing the total biomass potential from 200EJ to 100EJ, both hydrogen FCVs and BEVs are deployed by the end of the century.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "1fad66f7abd04d8407d072a69680c883ee3ccea9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "136327555", "DOI": "10.4314/GJPAS.V17I4", "CorpusId": 55907224}, "title": "Climate change: Causes, effects and mitigation measures- A review", "abstract": "The Intergovernmental Panels on Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have identified climate change as the greatest threat of the century and reported that the earth\u2019s average temperature has risen by 0.740 C.

The capture system was identified to be compatible with the operating conditions of different power plants in UAE. Also the amount of that can be captured from the major large power plants in close proximity of the field was estimated. The selected case study was modeled by COZ View software and wide range of numerical simulations was carried out to predict the oil production resulted from employing the proposed -EOR system. Economic assessment of employing CCS was also assessed by means of generating the relevant cash profiles. The obtained results showed viability of integrating CCS with -EOR in Zakum field for relatively small capacity power plant (i.e. Umm Al-Nar East) and moderate capacity one (i.e. Umm Al-Nar West) with payback periods of 3.7 and 4.6 years, respectively.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "0b8f30afd8d306e9f07c98340915b8c7ee438a63", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2861146285", "DBLP": "conf/i2mtc/DuanPWY18", "DOI": "10.1109/I2MTC.2018.8409828", "CorpusId": 49728924}, "title": "Measurement of the void fraction of gas-liquid two-phase CO2 flow using laser attenuation techniques", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a promising technology to reduce CO2 emissions from industrial processes. However, void fraction measurement is one of the challenging issues to be solved for gas-liquid two-phase CO2 flow measurement. This paper presents a novel measurement system using laser intensity attenuation techniques to measure the void fraction of two-phase CO2 flow. The measurement system includes optical sensors, a laser detector array and a monolithic processor. The performance of the proposed measurement system is verified through experimental tests under various conditions, including stratified flow and bubbly flow. The void fraction of two-phase CO2 flow ranges from 0 to 69%. Experimental results demonstrate that the system is capable of measuring the void fraction of CO2 flow with an error between \u22122% and 3.6%.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "b293c8ec88ff200fb14f697147c52f0caea1d3ec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2023564125", "DOI": "10.1615/IHTC15.PMD.008893", "CorpusId": 96124513}, "title": "Heat and Mass Transfer Model of a Packed-Bed Reactor for Solar Thermochemical CO2 Capture", "abstract": "A 1 kWth dual-cavity solar thermochemical reactor concept is proposed to capture carbon dioxide via the calcium oxide based calcination\u2212carbonation cycle. The reactor is oriented beam-up wherein concentrated solar energy from a heliostat field enters an aperture located at the bottom of the reactor. In the endothermic calcination step, concentrated solar radiation is captured by the inner cavity and transferred by conduction through a diathermal cavity wall to the particulate CaCO3 medium located in the annular reaction zone. The liberated CO2 is removed from the reactor to external storage. In the exothermic carbonation step, a CO2-containing gas flows through a bed of CaO particles in the reaction zone, forming CaCO3, while CO2-depleted gas leaves the system. The reactor design is refined using a numerical heat and fluid flow model for the calcination step. The Monte Carlo ray-tracing method is employed to solve for radiative exchange in the inner cavity, coupled with a computational fluid dynamics analysis to solve the mass, momentum, and energy equations in the concentric reaction zone modeled as a gas-saturated porous medium consisting of optically large semitransparent particles. The cavity diameter and length-to-diameter ratio are varied to study their effects on pressure drop, temperature distribution, and heat transfer in the reactor. Increasing the cavity diameter and length-to-diameter ratio decreases the radial temperature gradients across the cavity wall and within the reaction zone. However, it also results in increased pressure drop and reduced heat transfer to the reaction zone.", "year": 2014}]}
