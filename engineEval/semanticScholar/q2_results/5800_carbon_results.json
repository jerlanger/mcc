Particular importance was given to the development of CO2 capture and storage strategies. This work investigates the possibility to use carbonized rice husk as a low cost starting materials for the production of \u0421\u041e2 sorbents. The performances toward CO2 capture of materials based on rice husk were carried out in a static microreactor showed high efficiency up to 60% with respect to the previously studied carbon-based sorbents. Introduction Recently the international scientific community pays a great attention to environmental issues, especially climate change and global warming. Both these issues require global efforts to reduce the concentration of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2). To this aim, CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is still considered the main strategy for achieving CO2 emission reduction targets [1]. Three major CCS approaches are currently applied: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture and oxy-fuel combustion [2]. Post-combustion is the most advantageous CO2 capture strategy, as it does not imply substantial modifications to the combustion process technologies at the present days used. Among the many CO2 separation processes proposed, adsorption is the most mature and commonly adopted due to its high efficiency and lower cost. The use of solid sorbents offers remarkable advantages over the other separation methods because it is characterized by great capacity, ease of handling, selectivity and lower energy for regeneration [3]. A lot of materials have been explored as CO2 sorbent, including amine-impregnated solids [4], carbon-based and graphite/graphene-based materials, zeolite-based materials, MOF-based sorbents, silica-based sorbents, polymer-based adsorbents, clay-based adsorbents, alkali metal carbonatebased adsorbents, immobilized ionic liquid-based adsorbents, LDH-based sorbents, MgO-based sorbents, CaO-based sorbents, alkali zirconate-based sorbents, alkali silicate-based sorbents etc. [57]. This work describes the preparation of solid CO2 sorbents from biomass waste resources, more precisely sorbents based on carbonized rice husk (cRH). Rice is the one of most important cultivated food crop worldwide. It accounts for more than 20% of the world\u2019s crop feeds and productions for approximately 50% of the world\u2019s population. Rice husk (RH) is the hard protecting covering of rice grains. RH protects the seed during all growing season, since it is formed from hard materials, including lignin and opaline silica. Lignocellulosic materials, such as vegetable wastes, if properly treated under controlled conditions are an inexhaustible and renewable source of carbonaceous materials with reproducible chemico-physical characteristics exploitable in CCS approaches. Moreover lignocellulosic materials have a more even geographic distribution compared to that of oil or coal representing recyclable natural alternative to traditional fuel in the production of carbon materials. RH is a large-scale agricultural waste abundantly available in rice producing countries, obtained during the milling of paddy (22 wt. % of the weight of unmilled rice is received as husk) [8, 9] and various methods to produce carbon materials from this are well investigated. RH being the outer shell of rice kernels protects the internal components from external attacks of insects and bacteria, but also RH need to get air and moisture for the growth of corn. Due to this peculiar function, rice in the process of natural evolution has created in its husk characteristics shapes with nanoporous layers. These properties let us applying RH in different field of science: in biomedicine and environmental applications, as fertilizer, as a mineral admixture in concrete, Li-ion battery anodes, petroleum adsorption etc. When RH is carbonized under controlled conditions its surface area and porosity increase making carbonized RH a good candidate for CCS approaches. The adsorption properties of cRH are an interesting research subject in industrial and environmental context. Annually about 200 million tons of RH are produced in the world. The production and use of adsorbent materials based on RH can contribute to mitigate two environmental problems: utilization of agricultural wastes and CO2 abatement. There are many studies on cRH used for waste water remediation, also have a lot of adsorbent for oil products and blood [10-15]. In this work we investigate adsorption behavior of materials based on RH for CO2 capture. Experimental Carbonization of RH was performed in auger furnace in the 500\u00b0 800\u00b0C temperature range for 3 hours. More than 350 kg at day of carbonized rice husk (cRH) in Innovative Enterprises \u201cZhalyn\u201d in Almaty, Kazakhstan can be obtained. Carbonized rice husk features are presented at the Figure 1. high surface area, good porosity and a carbon content around 66 wt.% (EDAX) (RH was investigated in Nanolaboratory, al-Farabi Kazakh National University, Almaty, Kazakhstan). The presence of silica, revealed by EDAX, indicates that cRH can be stored for long time, without significant degradation. Figure 1. Characterization of cRH (SEM and EDAX). Sorbents based on cRH were produced by a base-leaching procedure [16]. We prepared 2 samples by treating cRH with two different strong bases: NH4OH (28% water solution) and NaOH (5M). The obtained samples were labeled as cRH-NH4OH and cRH-NaOH, respectively. Briefly, cRH was suspended into 200 mL of de-ionized water by sonication for 20 min. The mixture was kept at 30\u00b0 C for 30 min under stirring. After that, 10 mL 28% ammonia solution or 5M solution of NaOH was added. The mixture was kept for 1 h at 90\u00b0 C under stirring. The schematically workup of the reaction represent below in Figure 2. Figure 2. Base-leaching method to obtain sorbents based on cRH. Carbon dioxide sorption activity of cRH-NH4OH and cRH-NaOH was assessed by tests in a fixed bed reactor (shown below in Figure 3.) with CO2/N2 gas mixture (15 Nl/h) at a fixed CO2 concentration (3% vol), operating under atmospheric pressure. The CO2 concentration in the inlet and outlet gas streams has been measured by online continuous ABB infrared gas analyzer. A laboratory scale fixed bed Pyrex microreactor (ID = 1 cm, length = 60 cm) operating under atmospheric pressure has been used for the preliminary evaluation of the CO2 adsorption capacity of different samples. N2 and CO2 flowrates have been set by means of mass flow controllers (Bronkhorst), and subsequently mixed before entering the bed (Figure 3.). The CO2 concentration in the column effluent gas is continuously monitored as a function of time (breakthrough curve) until the gas composition approaches the inlet gas composition value, until bed saturation is reached. The time taken by the gas mixture to flow from the fixed bed to the analyzer has been previously measured by flowing the gas mixture through the empty bed (about 50 s) [3]. Figure 3. Fixed bed micro-reactor for measure CO2 capture. These measurements were performed at Institute of Research Combustion IRC-CNR, Napoli, Italy. Results and Discussion Preliminary results in terms of absorbed CO2 moles and time need for saturation of the samples (breakthrough time) are reported in Table 1. As clearly shown by the reported values, the sorption capacity of cRH-NH4OH was about 33.59 mgCO2/g better than cRH-NaOH (21,88 mgCO2/g) and both samples better than raw cRH (11,26 mgCO2/g and 8 s ). Time for saturation better with cRHNH4OH and total 25 s, then cRH-NaOH saturated time for this sorbent 13 s. It is better then samples based only RH, which saturation time was 8 s. Table 1.

CO2 capture capacity of the sorbents obtained from cRH by leaching with NH4OH (cRH-NH4OH) is higher than Ionic liquid supported on carbon black [17]. Also cRH-NaOH sorption capacity is higher than other composite and hybrids materials based on chemico-physical modification of carbon black [17]. These encouraging preliminary results open up the possibility to widely and profitably use cRH as a low cost biomass-derived materials for CO2 capture.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "ae3dffc068ac8b64a7cd4a5401484b184812df4e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2592154337", "CorpusId": 114478287}, "title": "Weight Estimation of Steam Cycle for CO2 Capture System on Offshore Oil and Gas Installation", "abstract": "Climate change due to increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions is a major concern both in Norway, and globally. Greater environmental focus and increased taxes on emitted CO2 have led to corporate efforts on reducing CO2 emissions. Offshore gas turbines are one of the largest sources of CO2 emissions from the Norwegian industry. One option to reduce the emissions is to capture CO2 from the gas turbine exhaust gas, followed by compression and offshore storage. This process is known as carbon capture and storage (CCS). Due to strict sizing limitations on offshore oil and gas installations, implementation of CCS is totally dependent on a compact and low weight design. To run this process, the reboiler in the desorber section of the CO2 capture plant requires steam. This steam is produced in a low weight steam bottoming cycle that is designed as a part of this study. The aim of this study is to answer the research question: \u201cWhat is the preferred weight estimating method for steam bottoming cycles on offshore oil and gas installations, polynomial representation or scaling laws?\u201d To arrive at a reliable weigh estimate, the steam cycle design is further developed from the specialization project, completed in December 2015. In the simulation software GT PRO, the steam cycle is integrated with CO2 capture and desalination. Because of its importance, the major focus in the design phase was on weight reduction. The total weight is calculated for the fundamental steam cycle components; steam turbine, generator and heat recovery steam generator, and is found to be 437.8 tons. The proposed design produces 37.7 kg s of saturated steam at 5 bar and has a net positive power output of 5 MW with both CCS and desalination implemented, and is therefore self-sufficient with both steam and power. Some promising results for weight estimation have been found. Two different methods were implemented; polynomial representation from weighted least squares method and scaling laws from robust fitting. The polynomial offers more flexibility, because more than one variable can be considered. If one desires a more detailed analysis, or if several design parameters are not yet determined, the polynomial approach is suited. The considered variables are steam and exhaust mass flow, and exhaust temperature. If the boundary conditions are fixed, as in this study, the scaling laws are spot on. Scaling laws form a very elegant linear solution when steam mass flow is considered in the weight estimation. The analyzed real weight data support a linear scaling relationship between weight and mass flow. The base case polynomial estimate made an error of 1.4%, while the scaling law estimate deviated by 0.5%. During validation tests, also outside the calculated range, the maximum errors were 2.2% and 3.1% respectively. The linear scaling law results were almost unrealistically consistent within its calculated range (<1%). This is most likely related to software limitations in GT PRO. II Sammendrag Menneskeskapte klimaendringer fra \u00f8kte CO2-utslipp har skapt bekymring i Norge, og internasjonalt. Et tydeligere milj\u00f8fokus, og \u00f8kte skatter p\u00e5 utslipp har f\u00f8rt til reduserende tiltak hos flere oljerelaterte bedrifter. Eksosgassen fra gassturbiner som opererer p\u00e5 den norske sokkelen bidrar til noen av de st\u00f8rste totalutslippene fra norsk industri. Et aktuelt redukjsonstiltak er \u00e5 fange, komprimere og lagre CO2 fra eksosgassen offshore. Denne prosessen er kjent som karbonfangst og \u2013lagring (CCS). Da dette systemet skal monteres offshore, stilles det h\u00f8ye krav til lav vekt og kompakt utf\u00f8relse. Denne prosessen er avhengig av vanndamp for \u00e5 utskille CO2 i en desopsjonsprosess. Dampproduksjonen foreg\u00e5r i en lavvekts dampsyklus som er utviklet som en del av denne studien. Hovedm\u00e5let med studien er \u00e5 svare p\u00e5 forskningssp\u00f8rsm\u00e5let: \u201dHva er den foretrukne vektestimeringsmetoden for en offshore dampsyklus p\u00e5 oljeog gassinstallasjoner, polynomrepresentasjon eller skaleringslover?\u201d. Et p\u00e5litelig vektestimat er avhenging av en realistisk prosessmodell. Dampsyklusen som ble designet i prosjektoppgaven (Desember 2015) har blitt videreutviklet, og er n\u00e5 integrert med CO2-fangst og et avsaltingsanlegg i simuleringsprogrammet GT PRO. Siden lav vekt er kritisk for offshoreinstallasjoner, var hovedfokuset i designfasen p\u00e5 vektreduksjon. Totalvekten for dampsyklusen er 437,8 tonn, og er beregnet ut ifra hovedkomponentene: dampturbin, generator og dampgenerator. Dampsyklusen produserer 37,7 kg s med mettet damp ved 5 bar, og har et netto elektrisitetsoverskudd p\u00e5 5 MW. Da er b\u00e5de CCS og avsaltingsanlegg implementert, som betyr at systemet er selvforsynt med b\u00e5de damp og elektrisitet. Analyse av simuleringsdata viser lovende resultater for vektestimering. To metoder ble utviklet, polynomrepresentasjon gjennom vektet minste kvadraters metode, og skaleringslover fra robust kurvetilpasning. Polynomrepresentasjonen er mer fleksibel siden flere variabler kan vurderes samtidig. Dette muliggj\u00f8r en mer detaljert analyse, som er n\u00f8dvendig dersom flere parametere er ubestemte. De analyserte variablene er massestr\u00f8m av damp og eksos, og temperaturen til eksosgassen. Hvis grensebetingelsene er l\u00e5st, som i denne studien, er skaleringslover velegnet. Skaleringsresultatene danner en elegant l\u00f8sning som er tiln\u00e6rmet line\u00e6r n\u00e5r vekten analyseres med tanke p\u00e5 massestr\u00f8m. Den line\u00e6re sammenhengen st\u00f8ttes av analysert vektdata for reelle komponenter. Det kalkulerte polynomet hadde et avvik p\u00e5 1,4%, mens skaleringsloven estimerte en vekt p\u00e5 0,5% fra simuleringsverdien p\u00e5 designpunktet. Omfattende valideringstester, ogs\u00e5 utenfor definisjonsomr\u00e5det til de aktuelle variablene, viste maksimale avvik p\u00e5 henholdsvis 2,2% og 3,1%. Resultatene for skaleringslovene var n\u00e6rmest urealistisk entydig innenfor definisjonsomr\u00e5det (<1%). Dette er mest sannsynlig relatert til begrensninger i simuleringsprogramvaren GT PRO.

The PRISM results show much greater use of nuclear power, renewable energy and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS) towards 2030, and a sharply lower contribution from natural gas and coal without CCS. The MERGE analysis shows that, assuming CCS would not be available, the use of coal would fall off sharply in favour of natural gas and there would be a fall in electricity demand driven by very high prices. With the Full Portfolio, nuclear power and advanced coal generation with CCS reduce emissions to a point where a much lower demand reduction is needed. By 2050 the Full Portfolio will have decarbonized the electricity sector and reduced the impact on electricity prices to below a fifth that of the limited portfolio. 2 figs.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "210cbd169de15c666cc925aee2cb83f3342f0292", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2183838231", "CorpusId": 131132759}, "title": "REMOTE SENSING OF BARLEY STRESSED WITH CO2 AND HERBICIDE", "abstract": "Stress cause crops to grow at less than their full potential and can cause reduction in yield; this is as a result of threats emanating from the causative factor(s) known as stressors.

The role that the precautionary principle in conjunction with the proportionality principle may have in balancing climate change mitigation and environment-protection interests will be considered.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "776105dbe3b8fc4b703ff73cf3c3d9438156d984", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 17999410}, "title": "three Making Carbon Capture and Storage Work", "abstract": "President Obama faces an old challenge of creating a national energy policy. That policy will be designed with multiple objectives in mind. After a year of record oil prices that added to U.S. economic troubles, some want an energy policy that will maintain lower energy prices. With nearly 150,000 troops still in Iraq and tensions raised with Russia over the Georgian invasion, some want an energy policy that will reduce American dependence on fossil fuel imports from these and other geopolitically sensitive regions. And with atmospheric carbon dioxide now more than 385 parts per million and rising, some want an energy policy that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This chapter focuses on how the United States can accomplish the third objective, reducing carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels. I argue that demonstration and deployment of technologies to capture carbon dioxide from large stationary sources, storing the waste CO2 in geological formations, is likely to be an essential component of any carbon reduction strategy, both for the United States and for the world, and is also consistent with economic and security concerns. It also reviews the major technical challenges involved with widespread deployment of carbon capture and storage, and discusses policies that would lead to the specific goal of capturing and storing the CO2 from all large stationary sources by the middle of this century.

Those sectors are dominated by the use of fossil fuels whose main concern on the combustion gases is the presence of CO2. Their emission in atmosphere accumulates Carbon, the main cause of global warming. The only way to continue to make reference to fossil fuel in the medium-long term and to avoid the carbon accumulation in the atmosphere is to use technologies capable to capture and sequester the carbon in the flue gases (CCS). In the sector of electricity production, several technologies have been proposed for the capture CO2, including absorption, adsorption, cryogenic distillation or membrane separation. All of them offer flexibility and easiness of application, but they need external energy to operate. On the other hand, particular interest is reversed to those technological options that are able to remove CO2 without energy consumption; even more attention is reserved to those technologies which, suitably integrated with other conversion systems, can produce electrical energy at the same time, so increasing the electricity production with respect to the original plant. They are defined active systems and one of these is represented by Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFCs). In fact, MCFCs are fuel cell capable to concentrate CO2 at anode exhaust, making easier its capture, separation and storage and in parallel to contribute to the electricity production.\n In this paper, a comprehensive model of the MCFC is used to assess the opportunity related to its use as a CO2 remover from a flue gas as a CCS active device, without energy penalties related to traditional carbon capture methods (MEA, pre and post-combustion, oxy-combustion, etc.). Hence, it has been integrated in a wider system with auxiliary components: compressors to overcome pressure drops, steam generator (also using heat recovered from MCFC exhausts) for fuel dilution, fresh air integration in cathode inlet section, heat exchangers for thermal management and recovery. A CO2 compression and drying section has been considered and represented as a multi-step intercooled compression.\n The so-defined system can be used as a plug-in device able to be coupled to flue gases with different compositions and thermodynamic operating parameters (temperature, pressure, flow rates). Finally, it has been applied to a case study (a Natural Gas Combined Cycle power plant - NGCC) and the performance of the MCFC in terms of CO2 removal capacity, electrical power generation and size have been evaluated as well the energetic and environmental impact on the reference NGCC power plant.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "e5cb1162ee7d04e4d902b1a46b72f111f6d09ded", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2184793006", "CorpusId": 42780424}, "title": "HKUST-1 Metal Organic Framework as CO2 Adsorbent in a Sound Assisted Fluidized Bed", "abstract": "Among all the carbon capture and storage technologies, adsorption is considered one of the most promising alternative due to its low energy requirements, thus stimulating intense research to find suitable and highly specific adsorbents for removing CO2 from flue gas.

These factors have not been quantified in the drier (450\u2013550\u2009mm), marginal cropping areas to the west. With widespread adoption of zero tillage technology and the potential for large increases in the capture and storage of rainfall in good seasons, mobilisation of salt could be exacerbated should crop water use be constrained by salt toxicity and/or nutrient deficiency. We investigated the size of salt stocks, historic deep drainage, and nutrient depletion under continuous cropping in the Grey and Brown Vertosols of the Walgett and Coonamble districts of north-western NSW. Soils collected from seven paired sites (cropped v. control native vegetation) showed chloride concentrations >500\u2009mg/kg within 0\u20131.2\u2009m, high exchangeable sodium percentage (~30%) at depth and deficiency in phosphorus, manganese and zinc.

Deductively, grouped countries or sub-regional studies are needed to ascertain the heterogeneous relationship and cross-sectional dependency among panels grouping. We fill these gaps with the recent empirical methodology to unveil the impact of foreign aid, CO2 emissions, trade openness, and energy consumption on economic growth. Thus a percentage rise in foreign aid corresponds to different significant weights in all panel groupings with exception of Southern African Development Community, which unveiled a non-significant estimate. Whereas trade openness in all panel grouping indicated a significant weight on economic growth. An increase in CO2 emissions has a significant material effect on economic growth in Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, Economic Community of West African States, and Community of Sahel-Saharan States. The impact of energy consumption on economic growth across the panel groupings was statistically significant with Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa having the highest weight impact.

In this sense, carbon neutral energy systems should already be available in large scale in the transition to the second half of this century. On the other hand, clean energy technologies, such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), still need a strong push to achieve their long-term goals. The so-called BECCS systems (sustainable bioenergy systems, combined with carbon capture and storage) are the only option to attain possible negative emissions. Besides the intrinsic challenge of deploying CCS technology, it is necessary to make reality large-scale and feasible bioenergy systems. This brings the attention to the sugarcane industry in Brazil, in which it is possible to produce fuel ethanol at a relative low cost, and with significant avoided GHG emissions vis-\u00e0-vis fossil gasoline. The results related to the avoided emissions could be even improved, with the storage of the CO2 produced during fermentation. However, it is possible to go further because the relatively low cost residual sugarcane biomass (bagasse and straw) has been used in conventional (steam turbine-based) cogeneration systems with substantial surplus electricity generation (2-3 times the electricity required by the industrial process). The availability of sugarcane straw at the mill site is a new issue due to increased mechanical harvesting; with good agricultural practice, it is possible that at least 40-50% of the available straw in the field can be transported to the mill for use as fuel. In addition, with non-commercial BIG-CC systems (integrated biomass gasification to combined cycle), it would be possible to at least double the generation of electricity in a sugarcane plant, compared to the results of conventional cogeneration systems. Moreover, since gasification is required, it would be possible to use precombustion capture technologies, reducing energy penalties. This is the rationale of an ongoing research line: combining the production of liquid fuels and electricity, using sustainable sources of biomass and maximizing carbon capture. In the proposed paper, in both cases the CCS unit considered is amine-based: pre-combustion capture of CO2 from biomass-derived fuel gas after gasifier, and post-combustion capture of the gas mix after its expansion in the gas turbine. Modelling is based on literature information for the technology based on amine, as well as the estimation of energy penalties associated with CO2 capture, transport and storage. The storage location is assessed considering depth conditions of the sandstones of the Rio Bonito Formation, one of the most promising formations for geological storage in Brazil.

As shown in the figure, a BIG-CC is integrated into the mill and the steam generated in the HRSG, after turbine expansion, is used to meet the demands of sugarcane processing and the CCS unit. The economic assessment is still ongoing and the cost of capturing CO2 will be estimated for both cases. As for geological storage, a source-sink correspondence based on the location of the sugarcane plants with the possible sinks was performed. Information on the location and milling capacity of 421 sugarcane plants was used and correlated with parameters of ten wells located in the Paran\u00e1 Basin. Results are presented in Figure 2. About 51% of sugarcane mills in the Center-South of Brazil (where is the bulk of sugarcane industry) are in the 300 km radius with storage points, that means feasibility for transportation. The authors believe that the results are crucial for estimating feasibility of pilot BECCS units in the sugarcane industry, and mainly to demonstrate the technical feasibility of implementing pilot units combined with biomass gasification.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the only technology that has the potential to mitigate climate change while utilizing these potentially stranded fossil fuel assets. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), International Energy Agency (IEA), and other international expert organizations see CCS playing a large role in the mix of climate mitigation technologies, but deployment has been slow. In light of the expected role of CCS and current limited deployment, this thesis explores the political and financial incentives that can further drive funding and implementation of CCS projects and evaluates the role of CCS in rescuing potentially stranded fossil fuel assets. This thesis includes three detailed analyses: (1) an evaluation of proposed command-andcontrol regulations from the US EPA for new and existing fossil fuel-fired power plants; (2) cases studies of how two successful CCS projects, Boundary Dam in Canada and Gorgon in Australia, were incentivized; and (3) an analysis of results from the AMPERE modeling study to estimate the global scale and value of stranded fossil fuel assets. From these analyses, five key conclusions are drawn. (1) CCS has the potential to rescue substantial coal, natural gas and oil assets and has the potential to hugely reduce global mitigation costs compared to a scenario without CCS. (2) The design of policy is crucial for CCS. Carbon pricing mechanisms must have a price high enough to incentivize CCS; command-and-control policies must not create loopholes for lower cost technologies; and financial incentives must provide sufficient funds, flexibility, and time to complete projects. (3) The role of bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) in top-down climate stabilization scenarios needs to be better understood, as these models seem to be overly optimistic regarding BECCS. (4) On an individual project level, stranded assets have the most value when there is no viable substitute available (e.g., transportation fuels) or when the fuel user also owns the asset (e.g., utility-owned lignite). (5) CCS on fuel production processes (e.g. oil refining and natural gas processing) are easier to finance than fuel utilization processes (e.g. power generation and cement production), but power plants remain the biggest potential market for CCS if it is to become a major climate mitigation technology.

The final aim of our project is to find out how to control the evolution of petrophysical parameters during CO2 injection using an optimal combination of flow rate, injection pressure and chemical composition of the influent. The first step to achieve this is to find a suitable condition to create a stable 3D space in carbonate rock by injecting liquid to prepare space for the later CO2 injection. Micro-CT imaging is a non-destructive 3D method that can be used to study the property changes of carbonate rocks during and after CO2 injection. The advance in lab source based micro-CT has made it capable of in situ experiments. We used a commercial bench top micro-CT (Zeiss Versa XRM410) to study the microstructure changes of chalk during liquid injection.

In the CCS process, CO2 from power plants and from other large CO2 point sources are captured and transported at dense (liquid or supercritical) conditions after which it is injected into storage sites. Accurately predicting internal corrosion rates in high-pressure CO2 environments is critical to the design and operation of pipelines used for CCS systems. In water-containing dense phase CO2 environments, corrosion rate increases in conjunction with humidity, typically reaching a critical humidity, beyond which corrosion rates become particularly high. The presence of impurities in the CO2 stream influence the solubility of water and hence the humidity and corrosivity of the CO2 stream. If the CO2 stream is under saturated and below a particular humidity level, then there can be significant cost saving on CCS projects, as this enables carbon steel pipelines to be used with confidence.\n The purpose of this work is to develop models to calculate corrosion rates of CO2 systems with under-saturated water conditions in presence and absence of impurities. These models depend on the solubility of water in the CO2 rich phase at saturated conditions. A modified Peng-Robinson equation of state (EoS), E-PPR78 (Jaubert and Mutelet (2004)), available in literature is modified to match water solubility in the CO2 phase for CO2 systems in the presence and absence of impurities at both supercritical conditions and on both sides of the two phase-region.\n", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "5114d5f9574cf05e41c774dcc6844011f2ef89a7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2806290934", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-7908-2076-8_5", "CorpusId": 139383116}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "eac0b981915c09d881096a4f25a6b55170a917f0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2080572186", "DOI": "10.2495/AIR120361", "CorpusId": 62753864}, "title": "Predicting the life time of steels in CCS environment from long term local corrosion experiments", "abstract": "To predict the reliability and safety during the injection of compressed emission gases \u2013 mainly containing CO2 \u2013 into deep geological layers (CCS-technology, Carbon Capture and Storage), the influence of heat treatment on pit corrosion needs to be considered.

In recent years, several theoretical and experimental studies in this field have been oriented towards capturing CO2 from IGCCs through the integration of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) for coal-syngas oxidation, investigating the so-called Integrated Gasification Fuel Cell cycles (IGFC). However, Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC) can also be a promising technology in IGFCs. After a rather comprehensive research carried out by the authors on modeling and simulation of SOFC-based IGFC plants, an interesting IGFC cycle based on MCFC is assessed in this work, where plant layout is designed to exploit the capability of MCFCs of transferring CO2 and O2 from the oxidant side to the fuel side. Syngas produced in a high efficiency Shell gasifier is cleaned and mainly burned in a combustion turbine as in conventional IGCCs. Turbine flue gas, rich of oxygen and carbon dioxide, are then used as oxidant stream for the fuel cell at the cathode side, while the remaining clean syngas is oxidized at the anode side. In this way the MCFC, while efficiently producing electricity, separates CO2 from the gas turbine flue gas as in a post-combustion configuration; oxygen is also transported towards the anode side, oxidizing the remaining syngas as in an oxy-combustion mode. A CO2 -rich stream is hence obtained at anode outlet, which can be cooled and compressed for long term storage. This configuration allows to produce power from coal with high efficiency and low emission. In addition, as already highlighted in a previous study where a similar concept has been applied to natural gas-fired combined cycles, a limited fraction of the power output is generated by the fuel cell (the most expensive component), highlighting its potential also from an economic point of view. Detailed results are presented in terms of energy and material balances of the proposed cycle.Copyright \u00a9 2011 by ASME", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "b8eb44eae17564db629ca8bf523921bdba87edf7", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 201635712}, "title": "Summary report on the analysis of the responses received to the Consultative Communication on the future of Carbon Capture and Storage in Europe [COM(2013)180]", "abstract": "In the fight against climate change, the European Union (EU) is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050.

Indeed, geological storage capacities may raise to several millions of tons of CO2 injected per year, allowing to reduce substantially the atmospheric emissions of this gas. One of the most interesting targets for the development of this solution are the deep saline aquifers. These aquifers are geological formations containing brine whose salinity is often higher than sea water's, making it unsuitable for human consumption. However, this solution has to cope with numerous technical issues, and in particular, the precipitation of salt initially dissolved in the aquifer brine. Consequences of this precipitation are multiple, but the most important is the modification of the injectivity i.e. the injection capacity. Knowledge of the influence of the precipitation on the injectivity is particularly important for both the storage efficiency and the storage security and durability. The aim of this PhD work is to compare the relative importance of negative (clogging) and positive (fracturing) phenomena following CO2 injection and salt precipitation. Because of the numerous simulations and modelling results in the literature describing the clogging of the porosity, it has been decided to focus on the mechanical effects of the salt crystallization and the possible deformation of the host rock. A macroscopic and microscopic modelling has then been developed, taking into account two possible modes of evaporation induced by the spatial distribution of residual water, in order to predict the behavior of a porous material subjected to the drying by carbon dioxide injection. Results show that crystallization pressure created by the growth of a crystal in a confined medium can reach values susceptible to locally exceed the mechanic resistance of the host rock, highlighting the importance of these phenomena in the global mechanical behavior of the aquifer.

Recent shale gas developments have increased natural gas production and availability while lowering cost, allowing a shift to natural gas for electricity production to be a cost-effective option. Natural gas generation in the U.S. electricity sector has grown substantially in recent years (over 31 percent in 2012, up from 17 percent in 1990), while carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of the sector have generally declined. Natural gas-fired electrical generation offers several advantages over other fossil (e.\u2009g. coal, oil) fuel-fired generation. The combination of the lower carbon-to-hydrogen ratio in natural gas (compared to other fossil fuels) and the higher efficiency of natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) power plants (using two thermodynamic cycles) than traditional fossil-fueled electric power generation (using a single cycle) results in less CO2 emissions per unit of electricity produced. Furthermore, natural gas combustion results in considerably fewer emissions of air pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM). Natural gas is not the main option for deep de-carbonization. If deep reduction is prioritized, whether of the electricity sector or of the entire economy, there are four primary technologies that would be assumed to play a prominent role: energy efficiency equipment, nuclear power, renewable energy, and carbon capture and storage (CCS).

After injection, the CO2 will spread and migrate as a buoyant gravity current relative to the denser, ambient brine. Although the CO2 and the brine are immiscible, the impact of capillarity on CO2 spreading and migration is poorly understood. We previously studied the early time evolution of an immiscible gravity current, showing that capillary pressure hysteresis pins a portion of the macroscopic fluid-fluid interface and that this can eventually stop the flow. Here we study the full lifetime of such a gravity current. Using tabletop experiments in packings of glass beads, we show that the horizontal extent of the pinned region grows with time and that this is ultimately responsible for limiting the migration of the current to a finite distance. We also find that capillarity blunts the leading edge of the current, which contributes to further limiting the migration distance. Using experiments in etched micromodels, we show that the thickness of the blunted nose is controlled by the distribution of pore-throat sizes and the strength of capillarity relative to buoyancy. We develop a theoretical model that captures the evolution of immiscible gravity currents and predicts the maximum migration distance. By applying this model to representative aquifers, we show that capillary pinning and blunting can exert an important control on gravity currents in the context of geological CO2 storage.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "1ba4eb9727f7d24bed1852048a8787e575c5fc82", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2562422735", "CorpusId": 133007995}, "title": "Does Carbon Capture and Storage Work", "abstract": "Hear experts on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) explain why CCS works as a technology to help mitigate global climate change.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "6003a1006eab675298d01094900a55bb62e5fbb2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2953425105", "DOI": "10.3303/CET1974139", "CorpusId": 198412927}, "title": "Comparison of CLR and SS Flexible Systems for Post-Combustion CO2 Removal in a NGCC Power Plant", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide is essential to life on Earth, however its concentration in the atmosphere has significantly increased since pre-industrial era, causing global warming and climate change.

Entire islands economies (Nauru) have collapsed in the mad hunt for phosphorus rock (Gowdy and McDaniel, 1999). Mineral reserves of this critical and valuable element are now being so rapidly mined from our Earth's crust that we are approaching a point where demand exceeds supply (Cordell et al., 2009). Why such a storied element? The answer rests in the fact that phosphorus is an essential ingredient in every known recipe for life: it is integral for energy storage, cell structure, and the very genetic material that encodes all life on the planet. Phosphorus is in fact, the staff of life (Karl, 2000), the scaffolding on which all biomass is built. Just as phosphorus fertilizer supports the growth of agricultural crops, phosphorus supply supports the growth of photosynthetic organisms, or phytoplankton, at the base of the marine food web. The biogeochemical cycling of phosphorus in the ocean is thus an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, which motivated this special research topic in Frontiers in Microbiology entitled \u201cThe marine phosphorus cycle.\u201d In total, 10 papers have been included, with 8 original research articles and 2 reviews. Collectively these papers detail new advances, important nuances, and unexpected discoveries related to phosphorus cycling in the marine environment. \n \nThis e-book begins with a number of papers detailing the production of dissolved organic phosphorus (DOP) in the upper water column. Original research by Mackey et al. (2012) documents the rapid uptake of phosphate by harmful algal bloom forming diatom species in Monterey Bay and the subsequent production of DOP as these blooms decayed. This latter finding is relatively novel- simply because relatively little is known about the rate and control of DOP production in the sea. To address this point, Ruttenberg and Dyhrman (2012) show that changes in the ambient inorganic nitrogen:phosphorus ratio may modulate the rate of DOP production in coastal upwelling regimes. Taken together these papers provide new insights into how DOP is produced in the ocean. \n \nRoughly balancing this production is biotic decomposition, which occurs as microbes scavenge organic pools for essential elements. For DOP compounds characterized by a C-O-P bond (esters), hydrolysis is catalyzed by a class of enzymes termed alkaline phosphatases. Organisms with the capacity to build this enzyme can hydrolyze DOP to access phosphorus, and if heterotrophic, carbon as well. Work by Lin et al. (2012) has shown that alkaline phosphatases are widely distributed within a certain class of marine plankton termed dinoflagellates. The twist is that the enzyme is differentially located within the cell in different lineages. This suggests that organisms may have an organic niche, i.e., they have evolved strategies to utilize alkaline phosphatase in different ways so as to compete for select resources. In related work in the oligotrophic North Pacific, where phosphorus is sparingly low, Bjorkman et al. (2012) use a radioisotope approach to show that heterotrophic bacteria and the ubiquitous photoautotroph Prochlorococcus are equal competitors for phosphate whereas heterotrophic bacteria are much more effective at scavenging model DOP compounds. These papers illuminate the myriad of mechanisms and strategies used by microbes to access organic resources. \n \nHeterotrophic organisms may not always hydrolyze DOP to acquire phosphorus for growth; rather these organisms may decompose DOP to access carbon and or nitrogen, leaving the cleaved phosphate in dissolved inorganic form\u2014remineralized. The remineralization of phosphorus proceeds as a function of the availability of the resource, the elemental requirements of the remineralizing bacteria, the lability of organic phosphorus resources, and environmental controls such as temperature. These critical processes are highlighted in several papers in this e-book. Suzumura et al. (2012) show that DOP remineralization rates are higher in the high biomass coastal ocean than the open ocean, whereas DOP hydrolysis appears to be inversely related to phosphate concentrations in the open ocean. In effect, the liberation of phosphate from organic compounds is a function of the number of enzymatically-active bacterial and autotrophic cells as well as the relative availability of phosphate that suppresses the need to hydrolyze organic substrates. Scott et al. (2012) then show that different bacterial isolates (freshwater in this case) differentially regulate their phosphorus composition in response to the C:P ratio of the organic substrate. Increasing the phosphorus content of substrates, thereby decreasing C:P ratios, leads to luxury phosphorus uptake by some isolates and net phosphorus remineralization by others. In this sense, the rate of phosphorus remineralization will then depend on the stoichiometric demands and the diversity of bacterial populations. There are environmental pressures on DOP remineralization as well. White et al. (2012) report that temperature is predictably related to DOP decay constants for select individual substrates, albeit the slope of the relationship varies widely between substrates (e.g., a mono-ester versus a nucleotide) and with differing microbial communities. These findings suggest that the environmental control of labile DOP remineralization will not be easily captured with a single master equation. Adding to the complexity, all of the above work largely refers to enzymatic degradation of C-O-P linked organic matter. There are other bond classes that are important sources of phosphorus nutrition: specifically, the C-P linked phosphonate compounds which are reviewed by Villarreal-Chiu et al. (2012). The enzymes that hydrolyze these bonds are poorly understood relative to alkaline phosphatases, but are no less important in the remineralization of DOP. Collectively, these papers describe the nuances and complexity of DOP degradation in the ocean. \n \nMoving from phosphorus cycling in the surface ocean to the action at depth, Flores et al. (2012) trace the contours of phosphorus in sediment records in the South Atlantic section of the Southern Ocean and find clues for a past \u201cWhite Ocean\u201d; a period of Earth's history when phosphorus scrubbed off continental margins during glacial highs fueled blooms of carbonate-shelled coccolithophores. These events would have enhanced the phosphorus burial rate in these rich polar ocean regimes. In addition to sinking of living and detrital cells, phosphorus also reaches the sediment adsorbed onto iron oxyhydroxides coating the surfaces of clay particles and colloids. Once buried, a complex series of biotic and abiotic processes lead to iron dissolution, release of phosphate and the precipitation of the phosphorus-rich mineral apatite. Extraction of these sedimentary phosphorite rocks fuels ~85% of the world's phosphate consumption. Yet the mechanisms by which this apatite forms are not entirely clear. Crosby and Bailey (2012) review the evidence for a microbial role in apatite formation; hypothesizing that fossilized bacteria found in phosphorite rock may be harbingers for the rapid precipitation of apatite by sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. \n \nEven now, over 300 years after the discovery of phosphorus, we are still unraveling the mechanisms, rates, and controls of phosphorus cycling on our planet. This compilation presents a snapshot of the diverse interdisciplinary research at the leading edge of these continued efforts. These collective papers provide a greater understanding of the rapid and critical cycling of phosphorus in the surface ocean, of the mechanisms, specificities, and rates of decomposition of organically bound phosphorus, and of the formation and preservation of phosphorus in the sediment\u2014they are an exciting step forward.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "2431b1bea04222fd2df336a14267c72e0823b857", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.2118/206156-ms", "CorpusId": 239181572}, "title": "Importance of 3-Way Coupled Modelling for Carbon Dioxide Sequestration in Depleted Reservoir", "abstract": "\n Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing and storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide. The objective of any carbon sequestration project is to store CO2 safely for hundreds or thousands of years with a goal of reducing global climate change. A depleted hydrocarbon reservoir is one of the potential storage sites being considered for long-term CO2 storage. The dynamic, geochemical, and geomechanics changes that occur during CO2 injection are inter-related. For example, when injected CO2 causes dissolution of reservoir rock, on one hand, porosity increases while rock strength decreases. On the other hand, reduced rock strength could cause additional compaction thus reducing porosity, whereas increase in pressure due to injection could cause dilation. Hence, it is critical to have an integrated model that captures effect of all changes on the storage capacity and integrity of the reservoir.\n Three major depleted gas reservoirs in Central Luconia field, located offshore Sarawak, are being evaluated for future CO2 storage. A 3-way coupled modelling approach that integrates dynamic model, geochemistry model, and geomechanics model is utilized to obtain cumulative effect of all three changes. This integrated model provides a more accurate estimate of 1) CO2 storage capacity, 2) Caprock integrity evaluation, 3) CO2 plume migration path, and 4) Volume of CO2 stored through different storage mechanisms (viz. hydrodynamic trapping, capillary trapping, solubility trapping, and mineral trapping). Apart from providing storage capacity, this model also provides inputs for evaluating integrity of caprock, fault reactivation study, MMV (Measurement, Monitoring, and Verification) planning, and estimating potential leak rates through plugged and abandoned wells.\n Using a 3-way coupled model, it is estimated that there is an average reduction in porosity of 5-10% (of initial porosity). This translates to an equivalent reduction in CO2 storage capacity of 5-10% compared to dynamic model. It is observed that pore collapse as a result of pressure depletion is primarily responsible for this reduction in porosity. It has also been observed that the injection can be continued till initial reservoir pressure is reached without breaching caprock integrity.

This study links efforts from academic institutions, industry energy operators, industrial partners and research institutes to answer fundamental scientific questions that can help us understand the subsurface and generate better exploitation practices. \n\nWe examine the geology of reservoirs used for geothermal energy extraction and carbon dioxide capture. We use a combination of field geology, photogrammetry, mineral analysis and experimental rock mechanics to understand fracture networks and fluid flow paths of two geologically diverse reservoirs in Europe: 1) the Hengill geothermal system in south-west Iceland, and 2) the Carnmenellis granite geothermal system in Cornwall (UK). These results aim to provide experimental data to refine numerical models predicting fluid flow and contribute to the quantification of the associated risks of exploiting the subsurface.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "c7b7dd736e4872d8007cfaa82da957be2d568580", "externalIds": {"MAG": "207697711", "CorpusId": 83071650}, "title": "Scanning of Microalgae Species for Biological Co2 Fixation at a Malaysian Coastal Coal-Fired Power Station", "abstract": "Biological fixation of CO2 has been identified as one of the emerging technologies under the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) program.

In this dissertation, two energy\u2013intensive systems are simulated and optimized. Advanced estimation, optimization, and control techniques such as a moving horizon estimator and a model predictive controller are developed to enhance the profitability, product quality, and reliability of the systems. An enabling development is presented for the solution of complex dynamic optimization problems. The strategy involves an initialization approach to large\u2013scale system models that both enhance the computational performance as well as the ability of the solver to converge to an optimal solution. One particular application of this approach is the modeling and optimization of a batch distillation column. For estimation of unknown parameters, an `1-norm method is utilized that is less sensitive to outliers than a squared error objective. The results obtained from the simple model match the experimental data and model prediction for a more rigorous model. A nonlinear statistical analysis and a sensitivity analysis are also implemented to verify the reliability of the estimated parameters. The reduced\u2013order model developed for the batch distillation column is computationally fast and reasonably accurate and is applicable for real time control and online optimization purposes. Similar to estimation, an `1norm objective function is applied for optimization of the column operation. Application of an `1-norm permits explicit prioritization of the multi\u2013objective problems and adds only linear terms to the problem. Dynamic optimization of the column results in a 14% increase in the methanol product obtained from the column with 99% purity. In a second application of the methodology, the results obtained from optimization of the hybrid system of a cryogenic carbon capture (CCC) and power generation units are presented. Cryogenic carbon capture is a novel technology for CO2 removal from power generation units and has superior features such as low energy consumption, large\u2013scale energy storage, and fast response to fluctuations in electricity demand. Grid\u2013level energy storage of the CCC process enables 100% utilization of renewable power sources while 99% of the CO2 produced from fossil\u2013fueled power plants is captured. In addition, energy demand of the CCC process is effectively managed by deploying the energy storage capability of this process. By exploiting time\u2013of\u2013day pricing, the profit obtained from dynamic optimization of this hybrid energy system offsets a significant fraction of the cost of construction of the cryogenic carbon capture plant.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "2dbc2d87ae27e825d2cc4b1e1c8aade3ddcc9efd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1978753768", "DOI": "10.1049/ET.2009.1210", "CorpusId": 109487359}, "title": "The global state of carbon capture and storage in 2009", "abstract": "The world's newest energy industry, carbon capture and storage (CCS) from coal and gas-fired power stations, is on the cusp of extreme growth.

Post-combustion CO2 capture using chemical absorption is a versatile end-of-pipe technology that can be implemented at all point sources of CO2, such as a power production facility or industrial plant. The increasing capacities of intermittent renewable sources in the energy system, such as wind and solar power, mean that fossil-fueled power generation faces a two-fold challenge: to supply regulating power and other ancillary services with increased flexibility while operating with near-zero emissions of CO2. Industrial plants generally operate under more stable conditions, and the main challenge for energy-intensive industries is to meet their long-term CO2 emission reduction targets, given that the possibilities for fuel substitution and further process optimization are limited in many cases and thus CCS will be required to meet this challenge. \nThe overall aim of this work was to evaluate operational strategies for efficient application of post-combustion CO2 capture to reduce emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion, while meeting the demands of an energy system with large shares of renewable energy. This involved a steady-state investigation of CO2 capture (with the focus on partial capture of CO2) in three separate industrial applications: a pulp mill; an aluminum mill; and an oil refinery. Furthermore, CO2 capture in load-following power generation under transient conditions was investigated. \nIt is shown that the concentration of CO2 in the flue gas has a strong effect on capture process performance and that the design of the absorber temperature profile becomes increasingly important at high concentrations of CO2during absorption based on monoethanolamine (MEA), which, compared to ammonia, has high reactivity and a high heat of reaction. This is further illustrated by the three industrial case studies performed in this work, in which the flow conditions and exhaust composition differed significantly between the industrial plants. The results suggest that it may be unfeasible to aim for a high overall capture rate at plant sites because they usually consist of several CO2 sources, some of which may not be suitable for CO2 capture. Opportunities for waste heat utilization also vary considerably across the industrial plants, which further emphasizes the importance of case-specific studies. \nThe evaluation of the impacts of transient power plant operation on the capture unit included two load-change scenarios: the transitions to part-load and peak-load operations, respectively, from design conditions of full load. Simulations of the load-variation scenarios reveal that the implementation of active control strategies improves capture system performance with respect to transition rate, capture efficiency, and the heat requirement, for both part-load and peak-load operations.

One of the most promising approaches to capture and store CO2 from such large point sources is the oxy-fuel combustion route, where pure oxygen instead of air is used in the combustion, which greatly facilitates the down-stream CO2 capture. The main energy penalty for the oxy-fuel process is related to the production of the oxygen, which today commonly is done in cryogenic air separation units (ASUs). An alternative approach, which requires significant less energy is the use of oxygen transport membranes (OTMs), which has the potential to reduce the cost and energy penalty associated with the CO2 capture and storage. This thesis focusses on the development and characterization of highly efficient and chemically stable planar asymmetric OTMs for direct integration in oxy-fuel combustion power plants. For the case of direct integration considered here the permeate side of the OTMs will be swept with recirculated flue gas whereby a driving force for oxygen transport through the membrane, which is fed with air on the other side, is directly established. It further facilitates thermal integration and thermal management in the combustion and avoids the need to handle pure oxygen. However, a direct integration scheme impose quite severe conditions on the membrane materials, such as stability towards both CO2 and SO2 and at low pO2 (1-10 mbar). The development of planar asymmetric membranes in this work, required the parallel development of (i) stable porous supports, (ii) thin dense membrane layers, (iii) porous catalytic backbones and (iv) meso-porous nano-particulate catalytic coatings. For the dense membrane layers, dual-phase composites consisting of a stable ionic and a stable electronic conductor were used to overcome the stability limitations commonly observed with single-phase membrane materials (e.g. La1\u2212xSrxCo1\u2212yFeyO3\u2212\u03b4 (LSCF), Ba1\u2212xSrxCo1\u2212yFeyO3\u2212\u03b4 (BSCF)) in CO2 and SO2.

An intriguing candidate with the potential to make a substantial contribution to this attempt is carbon capture and storage (CCS). The key advantage of CCS is that it provides the possibility to make a significant impact on the reduction of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants and carbon-rich industry processes while maintaining existing fossil fuel energy infrastructure. The technique could therefore be used as a transitional solution until fossil fuels can be eliminated from the energy generation mix, and the energy efficiency of industrial processes as well as appliances and products is further improved. Like other technologies, CCS comes with its risks and rewards. To minimize possible negative impacts on humans as well as on the environment, it is necessary to understand the risks and to address them accordingly. A range of monitoring solutions for geological CO2 storage sites is available. However, a cost-effective solution for the regular observation of atmospheric CO2 concentrations (or tracer concentrations) of large areas above onshore geological CO2 storage sites has yet to be developed. This thesis discusses the use of a helicopter unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to fill this gap. The robot platform and its autopilot are designed to cope with ongoing sensor developments in addition to providing safety features necessary for the beyond line-of-sight operation of the UAV. The design focuses on the use of commercial off-the-shelf components for the aerial platform in order to shorten the development time and to reduce costs. The autopilot does neither enforce a specific helicopter model nor defines a set position estimation unit to be used. Access to the control loop enables low-level extensions like obstacle avoidance to be implemented. The developed solution allows the monitoring of an area of approximately 750 m2 with one set of batteries in one altitude with a spatial resolution of 2 m by 2 m. Experiments show that point source leaks of as low as 100 kg CO2 per day can be detected and their source located. As opposed to autonomous take-offs of the helicopter UAV, autonomous landings on small dedicated helipads require an accurate localization system. A time difference of arrival (TDOA) based acoustic localization system which is based on planar microphone arrays with at least four microphones is proposed. The system can be embedded into the landing platform and provides the accuracy necessary to land the UAV on a helipad of the size of 1 m by 1 m. A review of existing TDOA-based approaches is given.

The benchmark carbon capture process absorb CO2 contain in flue gases through chemical absorption in a solution of monoethanolamine (MEA). To recover the absorbed CO2 an expensive and energy consuming regeneration step is needed. Reducing CCS energy requirement is crucial in order to make CCS commercially viable. Multiple studies have been conducted in order to find more efficient solvents. A new amine solvent family called phase change solvent has demonstrated very promising energetic performance. According to research they could reduce the reboiler duty from 3.7 GJ/tCO2 for MEA process to 2-2.5 GJ/tCO2. However most of the studies lead on phase change solvent focused on energy requirement only. Another important aspect to take into account is the sustainability of such processes. Indeed, phase-change carbon capture processes can be energetically more beneficial that traditional CCS using MEA however their overall impact on environment and humans should be at least equal or lower. Thus, it is important to assess their sustainability and the influential factors. The goal of this work was to develop an LCA framework for phase-change CO2 capture processes. The framework was applied to a reference system modelled on Aspen Plus v8.8 using a solution of N-methylcyclohexylamine (MCA) as solvent. The developed LCA takes into consideration, additionally to the traditional energy and material flow related factors a first level of degradation product and their treatment, aerosols formation and wash water treatment (e.g the formation of ammonia and its treatment by wash water). The three metrics considered are the Cumulative Energy Demand (CED), the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and the aggregated environmental score ReCiPe. Six scenarios were considered in order to assess the impact of degradation products, aerosols formation and threshold emission of non-conventional amine. The results presented in this thesis show a total heating requirement similar to the one in literature of 2.6 GJ/tCO2 but with a different distribution, spending considerably less energy in the stripper reboiler and accordingly more energy in the preheating of the rich CO2 stream that is fed to the stripper. This result needs to be further investigated by more accurate thermodynamic equilibrium properties estimation. The Life Cycle Impact Assessment demonstrates that MCA emission threshold has more impact on LCA metrics total value than degradation scenarios and that the most influential parameter is the amount of aerosol form in the absorber.

Regulatory outreach and execution for the current CCS-EOR project were initiated in early 2018 via direct engagement with multiple state and federal agencies. \nAssuming the FEED study results are favourable, this project could lead to deployment of one of the world\u2019s largest carbon capture processes on a power plant \u2013 coal- or gas-fired.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "5c1d5f4633ff0050efb7a92bece89d38e07bd5b4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3109496216", "DOI": "10.1002/cnma.202000541", "CorpusId": 229387712}, "title": "Cesium Ion\u2010Mediated Microporous Carbon for CO\n 2\n Capture and Lithium\u2010Ion Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "d330b2d020a4ed4805c99725fae3cf467d2fa103", "externalIds": {"MAG": "238265502", "DOI": "10.2172/960197", "CorpusId": 107727265}, "title": "DOE FY 2010 Budget Request and Recovery Act Funding for Energy Research, Development, Demonstration, and Deployment: Analysis and Recommendations", "abstract": "The combination of the FY 2010 budget request for the Department of Energy (DOE) and the portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) funds likely to be available in 2010 would (assuming that they would be split evenly between FY 2010 and FY 2011) result in a doubling in funding available for energy research, development, and deployment (ERD and D) from $3.6 billion in FY 2009 to $7.2 billion in FY 2010. Without the stimulus funds, DOE ERD and D investments in FY 2010 would decrease very slightly when compared to FY 2009. Excluding the $7.5 billion for the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loans in FY 2009, the FY 2010 budget request for deployment represents a 33 percent decrease from the FY 2009 levels from $520 million to $350 million. This decrease is largely due to the large amounts of funds appropriated in ARRA for DOE deployment programs, or $23.6 billion, which are three times greater than those appropriated in the FY 2009 budget. These very substantial funding amounts, coupled with the broad range of institutional innovations the administration is putting in place and movement toward putting a price on carbon emissions, will help accelerate innovation for a broad range of energy technologies. DOE's Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E) and the Energy Innovation Hubs are important initiatives that could contribute to two weak points of the government's energy innovation effort, namely funding high-risk projects in transformational technologies and in companies that have not traditionally worked with the government and strengthening the integration of basic and applied research in priority areas. Increasing the funding for different types of energy storage research, providing some support for exploring opportunities in coal-to-liquids with carbon capture and storage (CCS) and coal-and-biomass-to-liquids with CCS, and reducing funding for fission RD and D are other actions that Congress could take in the short-term. Energy storage may play a crucial role in the future of the power and transportation systems, which together consume two thirds of primary energy in the United States. A recent National Academy of Science report recommended carrying out detailed scenario assessments of the penetration of unconventional fuels from coal and coal and biomass with CCS. And the research plan provided for nuclear fission does not justify spending as many funds as were requested. The proposed funding for FY 2010 and the resources from ARRA, however, do not guarantee that the United States will finally enjoy the predictable and consistent publicly-funded energy technology innovation effort that it needs. The Obama administration must put in place a comprehensive energy technology innovation strategy that will ensure that an expanded ERD3 effort is both sustainable and efficient. This commission would be charged with, inter alia, developing a strategy that optimizes the integration of the various stages of innovation (research, development, demonstration, early deployment), as well as integrates efforts across technology areas.

There are various capturing principles, whereas to date most of the pilot plants are based on amine absorption. One commonly used primary amine is monoethanolamine (MEA). During the process of carbon capture, the solvent is subject to various degradation mechanisms due to oxidation, thermal strain, and unwanted side reactions within the system. After reclaiming the usable solvent for recycling, these degradation products accumulate as waste and need to be treated accordingly. Depending on the solvent, different degradation products may be found in this so called reclaimer waste, with ammonia as a dominant end product. Volatile products may also be emitted through the exhaust gas. Estimates from a full-scale amine-based capture plant predicts approximately 0.2 ppm amine and 20 ppm ammonia in the emissions. For a full-scale capture plant removing 1 million tons CO2 annually, these concentrations implicate emissions of significant environmental impact. Effluents from those various sources within the capture plant can be treated biologically to obtain nitrogen removal as well as general detoxification. Our studies have shown that MEA, as well as MEA-based reclaimer waste, can be treated with biological nitrogen removal, which is a well-established method within the field of wastewater treatment. Most important, by applying a recycled pre-denitrification reactor configuration, we have shown that the amine and its organic degradation products will serve efficiently as the carbon source needed for the denitrification step. Future development has to take these findings into consideration.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "30455979d17f679eade213649b01e68c14e2d0b1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2185433292", "DOI": "10.2172/1126716", "CorpusId": 110135227}, "title": "Bench-Scale Development of a Hot Carbonate Absorption Process with Crystallization-Enabled High Pressure Stripping for Post-Combustion CO2 Capture", "abstract": "A novel Hot Carbonate Absorption Process with Crystallization-Enabled High-Pressure Stripping (Hot-CAP) has been developed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Carbon Capture Scientific, LLC in this three-year, bench-scale project. The Hot-CAP features a concentrated carbonate solution (e.g., K{sub 2}CO{sub 3}) for CO{sub 2} absorption and a bicarbonate slurry (e.g., KHCO{sub 3}) for high-pressure CO{sub 2} stripping to overcome the energy use and other disadvantages associated with the benchmark monoethanolamine (MEA) process. The project was aimed at performing laboratory- and bench-scale experiments to prove its technical feasibility and generate process engineering and scale-up data, and conducting a techno-economic analysis (TEA) to demonstrate its energy use and cost competitiveness over MEA. To meet project goals and objectives, a combination of experimental, modeling, process simulation, and economic analysis studies were applied. Carefully designed and intensive experiments were conducted to measure thermodynamic and reaction engineering data relevant to four major unit operations in the Hot-CAP (i.e., CO{sub 2} absorption, CO{sub 2} stripping, bicarbonate crystallization, and sulfate reclamation). The rate promoters that could accelerate the CO{sub 2} absorption rate into the potassium carbonate/bicarbonate (PCB) solution to a level greater than that into the 5 M MEA solution were identified, and the superior performancemore\u00a0\u00bb of CO{sub 2} absorption into PCB was demonstrated in a bench-scale packed-bed column. Kinetic data on bicarbonate crystallization were developed and applied for crystallizer design and sizing. Parametric testing of high-pressure CO{sub 2} stripping with concentrated bicarbonate-dominant slurries at high temperatures ({>=}140{degrees}C) in a bench-scale stripping column demonstrated lower heat use than with MEA. The feasibility of a modified process for combining SO{sub 2} removal with CO{sub 2} capture was preliminarily demonstrated. In addition to the experimental studies, the technical challenges pertinent to fouling of slurry-handling equipment and the design of the crystallizer and stripper were addressed through consultation with vendors and engineering analyses. A process flow diagram of the Hot-CAP was then developed and a TEA was performed to compare the energy use and cost performance of a nominal 550-MWe subcritical pulverized coal (PC)-fired power plant without CO{sub 2} capture (DOE/NETL Case 9) with the benchmark MEA-based post-combustion CO{sub 2} capture (PCC; DOE/NETL Case 10) and the Hot-CAP-based PCC. The results revealed that the net power produced in the PC + Hot-CAP is 609 MWe, greater than the PC + MEA (550 MWe). The 20-year levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for the PC + Hot-CAP, including CO{sub 2} transportation and storage, is 120.3 mills/kWh, a 60% increase over the base PC plant without CO{sub 2} capture. The LCOE increase for the Hot-CAP is 29% lower than that for MEA. TEA results demonstrated that the Hot-CAP is energy-efficient and cost-effective compared with the benchmark MEA process.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2014}]}
