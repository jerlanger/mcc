Capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere or industrial processes and storing it in geological formations (carbon capture and storage, CCS) can help counteract climate change. Nevertheless, the interaction between well barrier elements such as cement, casing, tubulars, packers, and valves can lead to possible leakages. To accomplish successful carbon dioxide sequestration, injecting the carbon dioxide in its supercritical state is necessary. The supercritical carbon dioxide can corrode steel and elastomers and react with the calcium compounds in the cement, dissolving them and forming calcium carbonate and bicarbonate in the process. This carbonation can lead to channels forming on the cement-to-rock interface or cracking due to the carbonate precipitation, resulting in a loss of well integrity.\n This study focusses on finding ways that enable the continuous monitoring of cement integrity, under in-situ conditions, in a lab setup. The construction of an autoclave, capable of withstanding supercritical conditions of carbon dioxide, facilitates the in-situ monitoring. This autoclave also makes CT-scans of the pressurized sample possible, as well as acoustic measurements, using state-of-the-art piezo elements. The first tests will establish a baseline using neat Class G Portland cement to verify the design and sensors. The set up consists of a rock core in the middle of the autoclave surrounded by a cement sheath. A prepared channel in the center of the core expedites the distribution of the carbon dioxide. Once the ability of the sensors to monitor the integrity is verified, different cement compositions and their interaction with supercritical carbon dioxide can be studied.\n The experimental setup and the procedure discussed here closely simulate the downhole condition. Hence, the results obtained using this setup and procedure is representative of what could be observed downhole. The direction is not to remove the sample from the autoclave for analysis, as is the current industry practice, but to measure cement integrity under in-situ conditions over an extended period of time. Digitalization is powering the in-situ analysis in these tests.\n The first two tests of this study, using the afore mentioned autoclave, investigated the carbonation behaviour of two Class G Portland cement slurrys, one with a low and one with a high slurry-density. The low-density slurry showed extensive degradation and even the high-density slurry showed carbonation, but only close to the sandstone core.\n The results from this study can lead to the prevention of leakage of carbon dioxide to the environment and other formations, which defeats the purpose of carbon dioxide sequestration. These results should improve the economics of these wells as well as the health, safety, and environmental aspects.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "26567519e148c09162f3399ed68ce64000575532", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2038333485", "DOI": "10.1109/ISCID.2012.238", "CorpusId": 15576044}, "title": "Research on Skeleton Animation Motion Data Based on Kinect", "abstract": "Skeleton animation motion data is the connection of motion capture and computer skeleton animation technologies.

The intense degradation and deforestation for the need of agricultural land expansion result in a significant decline of forest cover. However, the expansion of agricultural land did not completely destruct natural forests. There remain forests inaccessible for agricultural and grazing purpose. Studies on these forests remained scant, motivating to investigate biomass and soil carbon stocks. Data of biomass and soils were collected in 80 quadrats (400\u2009m2) systematically in 5 forests. Biomass and disturbance gradients were determined using allometric equation and disturbance index, respectively. The regression modeling is employed to explore the spatial distribution of carbon stock along disturbance and environmental gradients. Correlation analysis is also employed to identify the relation between site factors and carbon stocks.ResultsThe result revealed that a total of 1655 individuals with a diameter of \u2265\u20095\u2009cm, representing 38 species, were measured in 5 forests. The mean aboveground biomass carbon stocks (AGB CS) and soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks at 5 forests were 191.6\u00a0\u00b1\u200919.7 and 149.32\u00a0\u00b1\u20096.8\u2009Mg\u00a0C\u00a0ha\u22121, respectively. The AGB CS exhibited significant (P\u2009<\u20090.05) positive correlation with SOC and total nitrogen (TN) stocks, reflecting that biomass seems to be a general predictor of SOCs. AGB CS between highly and least-disturbed forests was significantly different (P\u2009<\u20090.05). This disturbance level equates to a decrease in AGB CS of 36.8% in the highly disturbed compared with the least-disturbed forest. In all forests, dominant species sequestrated more than 58% of carbon. The AGB CS in response to elevation and disturbance index and SOC stocks in response to soil pH attained unimodal pattern. The stand structures, such as canopy cover and basal area, had significant positive relation with AGB CS.ConclusionsStudy results confirmed that carbon stocks of studied forests were comparable to carbon stocks of protected forests.

The emission from vehicle exhaust is one of the main sources of this pollution. As a greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles lead to environmental pollution and global warming. Since CO2 emissions have an impact on global climate change, remedies should be introduced to reduce pollution. The carbon capture and storage is the mostly proposed method for controlling carbon dioxide emission. This can be achieved with the use of CO2 adsorbents. The existing catalytic converters in vehicles fail to control carbon dioxide emission to atmosphere. Under no load conditions, the CO2 emission is increased by 234% while using three-way catalytic converter. This is because of the catalytic effect. The reactions that take place inside the catalytic converter leads in the excess emission of carbon dioxide to atmosphere. The scope of currently available CO2 adsorbents and their application in four-way catalytic converter are brought out here. The activated carbon and molsieve 13 X are used as CO2 adsorbents. Both the adsorbents are used in this work and analyzed. When activated carbon is used there is a decrease in CO2 emission by 86.91% and for molsieve 13 x, it is 69.16%, under no load condition. Thus it is found that activated carbon is 17.75% more effective than molsieve 13 x in reducing CO2 emission. The adsorption capacity of adsorbents decreases with respect to the increase in temperature.

One of the ways reducing the emissions to atmosphere is a proper capture and further geological storage of the carbon dioxide. In the oil industry, CO2 is used as one of the injection agents to displace oil and enhance its recovery. Due to the low multi-contact miscibility pressure between CO2 and hydrocarbons, fully miscible condition is quickly reached, leading to efficient displacement and high recovery factors. The utilization of the depleted gas fields for CO2 storage, however, is considered as the option that is more expensive compared to oil field, since the enhanced recovery of gas with CO2 is not effective. For this reason, our study considers the potential use of CO2 EOR in depleted gas-condensate fields. This potential is evaluated by performing numerical simulations for the typical-size gascondensate reservoirs with no active aquifer, in order to estimate both the storage efficiency and the additional oil recovery from condensed C5+ hydrocarbon fractions, that otherwise will be never recovered and lost in the reservoir.

A high level overview of the concept design can be described thus - the concept entails offshore geological storage of carbon dioxide and the means to effect this storage is powered by marine renewable energy.

The legislation establishing the California forest offset program, for example, requires that offsets be \u201creal, additional, quantifiable, permanent, verifiable, and enforceable\u201d. While these are all clearly desirable attributes, their implementation has been a great challenge in balancing complexity, expense, and risk. Most forest offset protocols carry similar accounting objectives, but often with different details, (e.g. Richards and Huebner in Carbon Manag 3(4):393\u2013410, 2012 and Galik et al. in Mitig Adapt Strateg Glob Change 14:677\u2013690, 2009).

The lack of a hydrogen distribution infrastructure and the lack of dense hydrogen storage technology are fundamental roadblocks along this path. One alternative approach is to use a high energy-density liquid fuel (natural or synthetic, such as methanol) as an intermediate hydrogen carrier, and generate the hydrogen on demand in an onboard fuel processor. This demands, however, development of technologies for on-board CO2 capture, storage, and recycling to eliminate direct emission into the atmosphere. This paper presents a thermodynamic analysis of feasibility of on-board carbon dioxide sequestration as well as various process/design schemes for the hybrid power generation-CO2 sequestration system. The primary difficulty in capturing CO2 from small-scale power plants (such as the internal combustion engine) is the extremely diluted state of CO2 in the exhaust gases. In contrast, onboard fuel processors have the potential to provide a highly concentrated CO2 exhaust stream, which could be separated, liquefied, and stored onboard at ambient temperatures with a minimal energy penalty. Current research efforts in small scale fuel processing are focused on producing a hydrogen-rich (or pure) stream from liquid hydrocarbon fuel with high yield and at a sufficient rate to provide the necessary vehicle power. Very few efforts reported in the open literature also address the need to capture the byproduct CO2 that is produced. The additional requirement of CO2 capture calls for fundamental change in the fuel processing strategy and reformer design. Several process or design schemes for fuel processing are identified, which produce hydrogen while allowing for CO2 capture. For example, in autothermal reforming of hydrocarbon or alcohol fuels, catalytic reactions of the fuel with air yield a product stream (hydrogen and CO2 ) that is diluted with nitrogen. Under the added constraint of CO2 capture, advanced oxygen membranes could be used to supply pure oxygen rather than air to the reaction, resulting in a more concentrated, nitrogen-free product stream which is favorable for CO2 capture. Simultaneously, this improves the efficiency of downstream hydrogen purification and utilization processes; thus, the penalties associated with CO2 capture are partially offset. In a similar manner, steam reforming of liquid fuels may not be the most attractive fuel processing option for automotive applications without consideration of CO2 capture. However, because the product stream is never diluted with air, it becomes a very attractive option for integrated fuel processing/CO2 sequestration systems. Consideration of CO2 capture early in the design stages of the fuel processing system allows a portion of the energetic penalty for CO2 sequestration to be recovered. While the design, analysis, and demonstration of an integrated onboard fuel processor with CO2 capture and storage is the ultimate goal, this technology is relevant to all small-scale, distributed power generation applications and should be an integral part of future CO2 abatement strategies.Copyright \u00a9 2006 by ASME", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "91a1a3b8e9b2729752b1dcb8c51f701a25f087e2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2991117397", "CorpusId": 213109081}, "title": "Accelerating the Deployment of Advanced Energy Communities: The Oakland EcoBlock A Zero Net Energy, Low Water Use Retrofit Neighborhood Demonstration Project", "abstract": "Author(s): Brown, Richard; Barr, Zach; Bourassa, Norman; Bowie, John; DeCuir, Nora; Diamond, H Jordan; Dryden, Amy; Elkind, Ethan; Fraker, Harrison; Fu, Wenjie; Guy, Ethan; Hamilton, Daniel; Lamm, Ted; Nicholson, Maika; Rainer, Leo; Robertson, Sandy; Scott Thomsan, Scott; Tome, Emma; Traber, Andrea | Abstract: This report describes the design development process and recommendations of a Community-Scale Zero Net Energy Master Plan for a residential block in Oakland, the Oakland EcoBlock. The recommended master plan includes an integrated system of energy efficiency retrofits, a direct current solar/storage/electric vehicle microgrid, alternating/direct current houses, and water efficiency retrofits with rainwater capture. The recommended master plan is projected to be close to zero-net energy (95 percent) for homes, reduce carbon emissions by 65 percent at the block scale (including transportation), and reduce water use 60\u201370 percent. The integrated system of energy efficiency and a direct current solar/storage/electric vehicle (EV) charging microgrid is the first of its kind at the residential block scale. This breakthrough because the deep energy efficiency retrofit savings free up enough capacity in the solar supply and storage to enable residents to switch from natural gas to electricity for heating and domestic hot water and to provide EV charging for 33 percent of vehicle miles traveled. The savings in household transportation costs are a game changer because when combined with savings in the electric and water utility bills, the total cash flow savings are projected to fund the capital improvements of the proposed systems. This project\u2019s benefits include lower and more predictable utility bills; greater resiliency because the system can operate during outages, and vastly improved indoor air quality by reducing natural gas consumption. The local energy storage reduces peak demand for the utility.

The key properties of SCEs that show net uptake of atmospheric CO2 are often characteristic of human-dominated systems, that is, high nutrient inputs from terrestrial systems, input of treated wastewater in which labile carbon has been mostly removed, and the presence of hypoxic waters.

The study aimed to investigate whether humic and non-humic fractions exhibit early, consistent, and measurable changes and affect TOC sensitivity and storage in a tropical sandy loam soils amended with corn cob biochar. Materials and methods There were four treatments with four replicates established in a randomized complete block design. Composite soil samples were taken from plots without biochar (CT), from plots incorporated with 15\u00a0t biochar ha \u22121 (BC-15), and 30\u00a0t biochar ha \u22121 without or with phosphate fertilizer (BC-30 and BC-30+P). The TOC, and humin, humic acid (HA), and fulvic acid (HA) fractions of soil organic carbon were determined for each treatment. The optical densities (400\u2013700\u00a0nm) were measured on the soil-free extracts by spectrophotometry; the densities measured at 465 and 665\u00a0nm were used to calculate the E 465 / E 665 ratios. Results and discussion The BC-30 and BC-30+P plots recorded the highest TOC, humin, humic acid (HA), and fulvic acid (FA) contents with respect to the lowest in the CT. The total exchangeable carbon stratification was significantly higher in all the biochar-treated plots relative to the CT. Spectral analysis showed higher values of E 465 / E 665 (5.02 and 5.15) in the CT and BC-15-treated soils, respectively, compared with the BC-30 and BC-30+P-amended soils with E 465 / E 665 ratios of 2.76 and 2.98, respectively. Conclusions Corn cob biochar applied to a tropical sandy loam: \u2022 increased the concentrations of HA and FA and led to increased stratification of TOC, with a stronger effect on HA compared with FA; \u2022 significantly lowered E 465 / E 665 at the high biochar application rate of 30\u00a0t\u00a0ha \u22121 , implying the dominance of high molecular weight humic acid-like substances, and increased degree of aromaticity of the TOC.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "98e9abfdd5bbda8ce5146fdbec45dc9eeb1bb0fb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2756136754", "CorpusId": 139705578}, "title": "Interaction of oxidizing and reductive components in CO2 fluids in transport pipelines (X70) at low temperature", "abstract": "Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) is a promising technology for the reduction of CO2 emissions, e.g. from fossil-fuel operated power plants or cement mills.

These particles are produced in an iron pentacarbonyl-carbon monoxide (Fe(CO)5 \u2013 CO) air diffusion flame system with and without the application of magnetic field. An ElectroMagnet was designed for the application of magnetic field on the system. Inhomogeneous magnetic fields have been found to promote combustion reactions in diffusion flames. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images and visual observations have shown the influence of magnetic field on morphological parameters i.e., the diameter of the primary particles formed and their aspect ratios. Studies have revealed that the chain like nano \u2013 aggregates consist mainly of Fe2O3, a material which plays a vital role in magnetic storage devices. Nevertheless, the control of the degree of uniformity of aggregate particle morphology has been shown in [1] to be difficult under flame conditions. Thus, there exists a critical need for the application of external magnetic field for effective control of particle aggregate morphology under reaction conditions. INTRODUCTION Magnetic fields are known to affect flame behavior as a result of the paramagnetic and diamagnetic behavior of the constituent gases. Paramagnetic behavior is observed in materials with atoms that possess a permanent dipole moment. In the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field, these dipole moments align with the field and thus paramagnetic materials are drawn toward the direction of increasing magnetic field strength. In diamagnetic materials there are no permanent atomic dipole moments. When a non-uniform magnetic field is applied, the atoms then develop a net dipole moment and oppose the applied field resulting in a weak repulsion to applied magnetic field [2]. The oxygen of room air which used as oxidizer in this study is paramagnetic and thus shows an effect when an external magnetic field is applied. Fig.1 (a) and Fig. 1(b) show the behavior of carbon monoxide-air diffusion flame with and without magnetic field. The selection of this particular flame system and fuel/oxidizer combination is justified since the primary particles formed in this type of flame have a natural tendency to form linear strings of aggregates [3]. EXPERIMENTAL SET UP A diffusion flame system was designed in the combustion and laser diagnostics laboratory [4]. The particle-laden flame is formed by directing a controlled flow of iron pentacarbonyl [Fe(CO)5]-seeded with CO through a 1\u20444 inch tube of a diffusion type burner. At a certain temperature, Fe(CO)5 decomposes and oxidizes in the presence of oxygen to form polyhedral primary particles of Fe2O3 [4,5] that tend to agglomerate into chain \u2013 like structures. The CO stream is seeded with Fe(CO)5 by bubbling a portion of the CO through a temperatureregulated bath of liquid Fe(CO)5 using a customized evaporator system. The mass flow rate of Fe(CO)5 has a linear relationship with the flow rate of carrier gas (CO). Thus, the amount of Fe(CO)5 seeded in the flame can be controlled by the amount of by-passed fuel. The postevaporator fuel tube is electrically heated to a mean temperature of 102oC to reduce the condensation of the Fe(CO)5 on the tubing walls. The choice of the Fe(CO)5 along with CO to generate iron oxide aggregates is based on the realization from previous works [1,4] that in this system chain like aggregates are formed. A thermophoretic sampling system was designed to collect iron oxide nanoparticles on 200 mesh carbon coated copper grids. This technique is well suited for collection of particles for morphology studies. A probe in this system provides an instant cold surface in the hot flame to establish a temperature gradient which drives the flame-born particles to deposit on the surface. The cold surface also quenches the reaction of particles that are already captured. The thermophoretic sampling system, consisting of pneumatic cylinder, solenoid valve and control box can accurately control the position and movement of the thermophoretic", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "ae5e61b8a6e382f4b08fd51d63550ab8902c5286", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1883091024", "CorpusId": 109465005}, "title": "Laboratory studies of natural underground CO2 migration improve understanding of long-term CO2 storage processes", "abstract": "As part of DECC\u2019s 2012 Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Innovation Programme, Cambridge University, Oxford University and BGS were funded to examine the long-term performance of geological seals to carbon storage. This study, undertaken in collaboration with Shell (Netherlands), focussed on a natural analogue site at Green River, Utah. Here naturally occurring CO2 has migrated for thousands of years into the overlying strata which act as a series of individual reservoirs and seals for CO2 storage. In order to characterise these materials the project partners were given access to exceptionally well-preserved borehole material by Shell. To help understand the processes governing flow within these formations, BGS undertook a series of laboratory experiments measuring the permeability of the main caprock seals. Results from these experiments yielded ultra-low values, suggesting that flow through intact caprock material is so slow that they can act as effective seals over geological timescales. Given these very low permeability values, combined with observations of changes in mineralogy, diffusion has now been identified as the probable dominant mechanism governing fluid migration through these intact caprock formations. Based on these observations, BGS is now in the process of determining diffusion rates for a number of key sealing lithologies.

To realize this potential, it is essential to develop methods that produce biochar with the characteristics needed for effective soil amendment.MethodsBiochar materials were produced from peanut hulls and pine wood with different pyrolysis conditions, then characterized by cation exchange (CEC) capacity assays, nitrogen adsorption\u2013desorption isotherm measurements, micro/nanostructural imaging, infrared spectra and elemental analyses.ResultsUnder a standard assay condition of pH 8.5, the CEC values of the peanut hull-derived biochar materials, ranging from 6.22 to 66.56\u00a0cmol\u00a0kg\u22121, are significantly higher than those of the southern yellow pine-derived biochar, which are near zero or negative. The biochar produced from peanut hulls with a steam activation process yielded the highest CEC value of 66.56\u00a0cmol\u00a0kg\u22121, which is about 5 times higher than the cation exchange capacity (12.51\u00a0cmol\u00a0kg\u22121) of a reference soil sample. Notably, biochar produced from peanut hulls with batch barrel retort pyrolysis also has a much higher CEC value (60.12\u00a0cmol\u00a0kg\u22121) than that (12.45\u00a0cmol\u00a0kg\u22121) from Eprida\u2019s H2-producing continuous steam injection process. The CEC values were shown to correlate well with the ratios of oxygen atoms to carbon atoms (O:C ratios) in the biochar materials. The higher O:C ratio in a biochar material may indicate the presence of more hydroxyl, carboxylate, and carbonyl groups that contribute to a higher CEC value for the biochar product. In addition, the increase in surface area can also play a role in increasing the CEC value of biochar, as in the case of the steam activation char.ConclusionComparison of characterization results indicated that CEC value is determined not only by the type of the source biomass materials but also by the pyrolysis conditions. Biochar with the desirable characteristics of extremely high surface area (700\u00a0m2/g) and cation exchange capacity (> 60\u00a0cmol\u00a0kg) was created through steam activation.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "0e34694594fc9f20fb5b277a458a906b52db3844", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2890022812", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-0-12-812752-0.00005-8", "CorpusId": 133704819}, "title": "Reactive Transport Modeling of Geological Carbon Storage Associated With CO2 and Brine Leakage", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "056a63be9cd55aa225ef5406bc8fe952a43dacde", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.2118/207572-ms", "CorpusId": 245060973}, "title": "Flow Assurance and Thermodynamic Challenges of operating CO2 Pipelines for variations in terrains and environments", "abstract": "\n The requirement for capturing and storing Carbon Dioxide will continue to grow in the next decade and a fundamental part of this is being able to transport the fluid over large geographical distances in numerous terrains and environments.

The objective was to identify potential risk categories for the long-term geologic storage of CO2 at the Mountaineer Power Plant in New Haven, West Virginia, USA. Over 130 FEPs in seven main classes were assessed based on site characterization information gathered in a geological background study, testing in a deep well drilled on the site, and general site conditions. In evaluating the database, it was apparent that many of the items were not applicable to the Mountaineer site based on its geologic framework and environmental setting. Several FEPs were identified for further consideration for the project. These FEPs generally fell into categories related to variations in subsurface geology, well completion materials, and the behavior of CO2 in the subsurface. Results from the screening were used to provide guidance on injection system design, develop a monitoring program, perform reservoir simulations, and other risk assessment efforts. Initial work indicates that the significant FEPs may be accounted for by focusing the storage program on these potential issues. The screening method was also useful in identifying unnecessary items that were not significant given the site-specific geology and proposed scale of the project. Overall, the FEP database approach provides a comprehensive methodology for assessing potential risk for a practical CO2 storage application. IntroductionConcerns about increasing trends in atmospheric greenhouse gases have prompted research into several CO2 mitigation options. Sequestration in geologic reservoirs has emerged as one of the more viable technologies available to address emissions from large point sources such as power plants, refineries, and other industrial facilities. Experience with natural gas storage, enhanced oil recovery, natural CO2 fields, and hazardous waste injection demonstrate that injection of CO2 emissions into deep rock formations is a safe and practical technology, but there is some risk associated with application of geological storage. To address this potential risk, CO2 sequestration has developed into a storage concept involving monitoring, measurement, and verification of the injected CO2 to prove that the CO2 is safely sequestered. However, a wide range of factors may affect a storage project, and it is difficult to account for all these items in developing a storage and monitoring program. As such, a FEP database was developed by Quintessa to assess safety and performance of geological storage of CO2 (Savage et al., 2004). The database is an extensive list of possible features, events, and processes that should be considered in a storage project. This systems analysis approach has been used for numerous applications, most notably radioactive waste disposal. A FEP screening approach was selected for the Ohio River Valley CO2 Storage Project to aid in design and feasibility evaluation for an injection system at the site. The objective of the screening was to identify the main FEPs needed to be considered for the project. The project itself is aimed at providing an understanding of the viability of carbon capture and sequestration by performing an integrated demonstration of CO2 capture and geologic sequestration at an active power plant in the Ohio River Valley. This region is a significant energy producer in the United States and has a large potential capacity for geologic storage of CO2 (Bergman and Winter 1995). Battelle is leading the project with support from DOE\u2019s National Energy Technology Laboratory to investigate the feasibility of geologic sequestration of CO2 in the Ohio River Valley Region. American Electric Power (AEP), BP, the Ohio Coal Development Office (OCDO) of the Ohio Department of Development, and Schlumberger are providing additional sponsorship and technical input. The site is located just south of New Haven, West Virginia, along the Ohio River at the AEP Mountaineer Power Plant (Figure 1). The plant is a modern 1,300-megawatt coal-fired steam electric generating unit that burns low sulfur coal and is equipped with electrostatic precipitators for particulate emissions control (AEP 1974). The site was selected for investigation in 2002, and a sequential series of characterization tasks were completed to prepare for injection. Initial efforts focused on reviewing the geologic framework of the area as it applies to potential storage reservoirs and caprock (Sminchak et al., 2004). Based on guidelines from this work, a 2,800 m deep well, named \u201cAEP #1,\u201d was drilled on the Mountaineer site. The AEP #1 well had dual purposes: 1. an exploratory boring to characterize geologic storage options; and 2. an on-site injection well for a CO2 capture and storage demonstration for the power plant. Extensive rock core testing, wireline logging, brine sampling, and geomechanical analyses were completed in association with the drilling. A 2-D seismic survey was also performed in two 9 km long transects through the well site (Gupta et al., 2004). Reservoir tests were also completed in the target storage reservoirs and caprock intervals. Risk assessment, public outreach, and reservoir simulations were also included in the project. The next phase proposed in the program is development of a pilot-scale CO2 capture and storage system. This step involves design and evaluation of a system to capture a portion of emissions from the plant, separate the CO2, compress the CO2 into a supercritical liquid, inject this fluid in an injection well, and monitor the fate of the CO2 in the storage reservoir (Figure 2). Injection of less than 0.5% of plant CO2 total emissions per day over a period of approximately 2+ years is the current goal of the design phase (total injection of less than 100,000 metric tons CO2). A smaller scale of injection was selected to allow for flexibility in optimizing the capture process because this is the first project of its kind at an active power plant. Since the program is in a design and planning stage, a FEP screening was considered constructive to guide future activities. MethodsThe general screening method was used to analyze each item in the generic FEP database against the corresponding site-specific conditions at the Mountaineer site. A conceptual model of the site was developed describing the geologic framework, target storage reservoirs, containment units, brine chemistry, environmental conditions, and proposed injection system. This information was then used in a sequential screening process aimed at identifying the main FEPs that apply to the project. FEP DatabaseScreening items were obtained from the \u201cGeneric FEP Database for the Assessment of LongTerm Performance and Safety of the Geological Storage of CO2\u201d (Savage et al., 2004). The FEP database is divided into seven main classes, covering events as broad as neotectonics to microscopic processes such as complexation of CO2 with heavy metals. Most FEPs are grouped in the CO2 Properties and Geosphere categories, because these are key topics for CO2 storage reservoirs. The database only addresses geologic storage, and items related to capture and injection are not included. The FEP database is designed to involve a systematic analysis, but it does not prescribe a numeric value to items. An explanation is supplied for each FEP item, but it is up to some interpretation as to whether it applies to a certain site. To account for this uncertainty, a multi-level screening process was employed for the FEP analysis. FEP Screening MethodsA stepwise approach was utilized to identify the FEPs that should be considered for the Ohio River Valley CO2 Storage Project (Figure 2). Screening methods involved the following steps: 1. Compiling characterization data into a site-specific conceptual model 2. Level 1 screening of FEPs for non-applicable or unlikely items 3. Level 2 screening of FEPs that do not apply based on general site conditions and/or site characterization results 4. Level 3 screening using site testing and/or system specifications 5. Providing recommendations on addressing remaining FEPs into system design, monitoring, and application. Initial screening identified items that were non-applicable, programmatic issues related to CO2 storage concepts, or legacy issues beyond the scope of a pilot-scale demonstration. The next level of screening examined the remaining FEP items in relation to general site conditions and site characterization results. If site information convincingly eliminated any concerns regarding the FEP, it was removed from further analysis. Level 3 screening was based on more quantitative information from site testing and/or system specifications. The remaining FEP items were compiled and analyzed to determine how they may affect the CO2 storage project. Lastly, recommendations were made on how system design, monitoring, and storage application may be customized to address the FEPs identified in the screening.

This paper (1) assesses spatial and temporal dynamics of suspended and stored sediments in the Ehen, (2) characterises the composition of stored sediment, (3) develops fine sediment budgets for downstream river reaches, and (4) assesses the controls on the storage of fine sediment in the riverbed.Materials and methodsA 3-km study section in the upper part of the River Ehen was divided into two reaches. Suspended sediments were monitored at the downstream limits of each reach over a 2-year period. In-channel storage was measured in three morphological units within the upper reach, on 13 occasions over the same period. Samples were used to assess changes in volumes of stored fine sediment, as well as the grain sizes and organic content of the material. A time-lapse camera facing the confluence of the tributary was used to conceptualise different flow scenarios. These scenarios reflect the degree of synchronicity between flows in the main-stem and those in the tributary. Fine sediment budgets were developed for each reach to assess the relative contribution of different sources of sediment.Results and discussionThe reconnection significantly affected suspended sediment loads in the Ehen. Bed storage increased twofold, with changes most evident in the slow-flowing morphological unit. Changes in the composition of stored sediment were less marked than changes in the quantity of material. Changes in bed storage were controlled by the degree of synchronicity between flows in the Ehen and those in the newly reconnected tributary. Results show that three generalised flow scenarios occur, with total asynchronicity between flows in the tributary and the Ehen being responsible for the main episodes of fine sediment deposition. Overall, the estimated sediment budgets provide insights into the importance of non-perennial sources of sediment in supply-limited systems such as the Ehen. Although bed storage values are within the range of those published for UK rivers, the increase observed since the reconnection, together with the persistence of a static pavement, highlights the ecologically critical conditions of the regulated main-stem River Ehen.ConclusionsIntermittent sources control fine sediment transport dynamics in the upper River Ehen. In this regulated river, ongoing deposition associated with increased low- and medium-sized flow events exerts more of a control on bed storage than large but rare floods. Management actions to limit delivery of material from lateral sources could help prevent further deterioration of habitat conditions for biota sensitive to fine sediment. Given the ongoing adjustment in the newly reconnected tributary, continued monitoring is needed to capture further morphosedimentary response in the main-stem.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "bf326582455158000edb9ce764cc088b288e6238", "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "2111.01598", "CorpusId": 240420127}, "title": "Integrated Assessment Modeling of Korea 2050 Carbon Neutrality Technology Pathways", "abstract": "This integrated assessment modeling research analyzes what Korea's 2050 carbon neutrality would require for the national energy system and the role of the power sector concerning the availability of critical mitigation technologies.

Across all technology scenarios examined in this study, extensive and rapid energy system transition is imperative, requiring the large-scale deployment of renewables and carbon capture & storage (CCS) early on and negative emission technologies (NETs) by the mid-century. Importantly, rapid decarbonization of the power sector that goes with rapid electrification of end-uses seems to be a robust national decarbonization strategy. Furthermore, we contextualize our net-zero scenario results using policy costs, requirements for natural resources, and the expansion rate of zero-carbon technologies. We find that the availability of nuclear power lowers the required expansion rate of renewables and CCS, alleviating any stress on terrestrial and geological systems. By contrast, the limited availability of CCS without nuclear power necessarily demands a very high penetration of renewables and significantly high policy compliance costs, which would decrease the feasibility of achieving the carbon neutrality target.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "ac41ce34950967e40e61bd557d82a42962af3223", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2048794700", "DOI": "10.1385/ABAB:120:3:159", "CorpusId": 37065223, "PubMed": "15767690"}, "title": "Biotechnological storage and utilization of entrapped solar energy", "abstract": "Our laboratory has recently developed a device employing immobilized F0F1 adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) that allows synthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine 5\u2032-diphosphate and inorganic phosphate using solar energy.

Most of the industrial applications of the caption procedures of CO2 were in the installations of ammonia producing and the chemical absorption procedures had them, and when the gas is under pressure, the physical absorption ones are applied, or the combined ones - chemical and physical absorption. This study demonstrates that the use of the best available technology for post-combustion CO2 capture, namely the chilled ammonia process (CAP), is closest to being commercialized. Introduction. The idea of capturing CO2 from the flue gas of power plants did not start with concern about the greenhouse effect. Rather, it gained attention as a possible economic source of CO2, especially for use in enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations where CO2 is injected into oil reservoirs to increase the mobility of the oil and, therefore, the productivity of the reservoir. Several commercial CO2 capture plants were constructed in the late 1970s and early 1980s in the US (Arnold et al 1982). Several more CO2 capture plants were subsequently built (Barchas & Davis 1992) to take advantage of some of the economic incentives in the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978 for \"qualifying facilities\" and to provide CO2 for sale commercially. The energetic industry, the chemical industry, metallurgy, concrete production, transports, waste burning are the most important emission sources of the gases having a greenhouse effect, contributing to global warming. Nowadays, at a global level, 22 bill. tones of CO2, out of which 8 bill. tones come from coal burning, are released into the atmosphere (Crutzen & Lelieveld 2013). The energetic system based on coal is mostly responsible for polluting emissions. At the same time nonetheless, we remain dependent to coal for the following years: coal is cheaper and more available. Nigel Yaxley, ex president of the Euracoal Association, says that the fastest growing energy source at a global level is still coal (3,1 % increase in 2008). Therefore, the technologies which allow the clean extraction and exploiting of coal are indispensable: \"The caption and storage of coal must be a part of the solution for emission reduction\" (Maroto-Valer et al 2002). The European Union has adopted ambitious objectives for the reduction of gas emissions that produce the greenhouse effect, which cannot be fulfilled without a significant reduction of CO2 emissions produced by the usage of fossil fuels (Omer 2004). From a technical point of view, this reduction is also possible by applying three measurement types: - the improvement of energetic efficiency; - the usage of energy sources which can be regenerated; - the caption and storage of carbon dioxide currently released. The energetic efficiency and the energy sources that can be regenerated represent, on the long term, the most abiding solutions for the safety of energy supplying and for the climate conservation.

To date, reduction efforts have primarily focused on minimizing the production of carbon dioxide during electricity generation, transport, and other activities. Going forward, to the extent that carbon dioxide continues to be produced, it will need to be captured before release. The captured carbon dioxide can then be utilized in some fashion or injected into underground geological formations (e.g., depleted oil and gas reserves, deep saline aquifers, or basalt rock reservoirs) where it will hopefully remain permanently sequestered. This injection process is referred to as \u201ccarbon capture and storage\u201d (CCS).Significant research has been undertaken to identify possible carbon dioxide injection sites in the continental United States. There is also growing interest in the possibility of injecting carbon dioxide offshore into geological formations underlying the seabed. However, little is currently known about the legal regime for sub-seabed injection. This article outlines the key legal requirements for injecting carbon dioxide into the seabed off the northeast coast of the U.S.The legal requirements for offshore carbon dioxide injection differ depending on the location of the injection operation. Injection operations undertaken in the Northeastern U.S., within three nautical miles of the coast (i.e., in \u201cstate waters\u201d), are regulated under the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Underground Injection Control Program. That Program does not, however, apply to operations in \u201cfederal waters,\u201d 3 to 200 nautical miles from shore, or on the \u201chigh seas\u201d beyond those waters.There is currently no regulatory regime specific to carbon dioxide injection in federal waters or on the high seas. However, injection operations in those areas may be regulated under general programs, such as the ocean dumping regime established in the Marine Protection, Research, and Sanctuaries Act (MPRSA). The MPRSA was enacted to fulfill the U.S.\u2019s obligations under the London Convention, which aims to prevent pollution of the seas by waste and/or other materials. Consistent with the terms of the Convention, the MPRSA regulates the disposal of material at sea. The EPA has suggested that the MPRSA may apply to the injection of carbon dioxide into the seabed.Assuming it applies to seabed injection, the MPRSA may operate as a barrier to offshore CCS. Under the MPRSA, any person transporting material from the U.S. for the purpose of dumping it at sea, whether in state waters, federal waters, or on the high seas, must obtain a permit from the EPA. Notably, the EPA cannot grant a permit when the material consists of industrial waste, which is defined as \u201csolid, semi-solid, or liquid waste generated by a manufacturing or processing plant.\u201d The dumping of such waste is therefore effectively prohibited by the MPRSA.Depending on whether carbon dioxide is considered an industrial waste, the MPRSA may operate either to ban its offshore injection or allow its injection with a permit from the EPA. Various other permits and authorizations may also be required depending on where and how injection occurs. The key requirements are outlined in this article.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "e5c2dd3e879cc66fe0a3e06a9910cf97be042d35", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/sc/ChenSHALC14", "MAG": "1981257396", "DOI": "10.1109/SC.2014.65", "CorpusId": 2909637}, "title": "NUMARCK: Machine Learning Algorithm for Resiliency and Checkpointing", "abstract": "Data check pointing is an important fault tolerance technique in High Performance Computing (HPC) systems. As the HPC systems move towards exascale, the storage space and time costs of check pointing threaten to overwhelm not only the simulation but also the post-simulation data analysis. One common practice to address this problem is to apply compression algorithms to reduce the data size. However, traditional lossless compression techniques that look for repeated patterns are ineffective for scientific data in which high-precision data is used and hence common patterns are rare to find. This paper exploits the fact that in many scientific applications, the relative changes in data values from one simulation iteration to the next are not very significantly different from each other. Thus, capturing the distribution of relative changes in data instead of storing the data itself allows us to incorporate the temporal dimension of the data and learn the evolving distribution of the changes. We show that an order of magnitude data reduction becomes achievable within guaranteed user-defined error bounds for each data point. We propose NUMARCK, North western University Machine learning Algorithm for Resiliency and Check pointing, that makes use of the emerging distributions of data changes between consecutive simulation iterations and encodes them into an indexing space that can be concisely represented. We evaluate NUMARCK using two production scientific simulations, FLASH and CMIP5, and demonstrate a superior performance in terms of compression ratio and compression accuracy. More importantly, our algorithm allows users to specify the maximum tolerable error on a per point basis, while compressing the data by an order of magnitude.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "71604769a10e384bccc9cb70c403080f996e3398", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 54848154}, "title": "THESIS FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY Modelling the Role of Nuclear Power and Variable Renewables in Climate Change Mitigation", "abstract": "As the number of people on Earth and our energy needs have increased the system for providing this energy has become ever more complex and complicated and thus the need for more systematic understanding of it has grown. However, change in energy system is slow and many of the challenges that we face such as mitigating climate change need global solutions. Energy system models with long time span and global reach provide a way to analyse questions related to these challenges. This thesis focuses on capturing the role of nuclear power and variable renewables in global long term energy models. Papers I, II and IV assess the potential role nuclear power can play in global climate mitigation as well as identify the determining factors of this contribution whereas Paper III looks at the possible effects of phase out of Swedish nuclear power on European CO2 emissions and electricity prices. We show that nuclear power can reduce the climate change mitigation cost if allowed to remain or expand. The main factors determining the cost reduction potential are availability and cost of carbon capture and storage and cost of renewable and nuclear technologies. However, to decide whether to allow for a large scale expansion of nuclear power, the observed cost savings must be weighed against increased risks of accidental radiation releases from reactor operation, waste storage and nuclear weapons proliferation. To make this decision economic as well as non-economic factors should also be considered. To analyse such concerns we use post analysis of model scenarios in Paper I to assess the nuclear power expansion\u2019s effect on nuclear weapons\u2019 proliferation and apply the multi-criteria model analysis (MCMA) method in Paper IV to actively include criteria such as proliferation concern and energy security into optimisation. We find that MCMA method significantly improves the analysis of attainability of multiple simultaneous goals such in large-scale energysystems models compared to simple scenario analysis that is presented in Paper I. The approach is more intuitive and requires minimal mathematical skills on the part of the user. MCMA method also avoids infeasible or dominated solutions that are caused by the stringent constraints applied in parametric optimisation. Paper V presents a method for capturing the effects of intermittency induced by variable renewables into the power system. Our results show that this approach manages to capture many aspects such as need for flexible generation capacity and curtailment at high penetration levels. We also find optimal electricity production mixes to vary significantly between regions due to different endowments of solar and wind resources. We show that adding electricity storage to the system will favour solar power but has only a minor effect on wind and nuclear power.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "3bfb6f5943bff84d4fce24323fd48e856b320f52", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3390/en14217026", "CorpusId": 240204789}, "title": "Comparison of Long-Term Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage to Reference Power Generation Technologies Using CO2 Avoidance Cost in the U.S.", "abstract": "Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) can sequester atmospheric CO2, while producing electricity.

Approximately 73% of current coal power plants are approaching retirement by the year 2035 in the U.S. After considering CO2 sequestered from the atmosphere and coal power plant CO2 emissions displaced by BECCS, CO2 emissions can be reduced by 1.4 billion tonnes per year in the U.S. alone at a cost of $88 to $116 per tonne of CO2 removed from the atmosphere, for 10% to 90% of available biomass used, respectively.

As carbon monoxide (CO) has potent cytoprotective functions on vascular endothelial cells, this study examined if CO treatment of excised liver grafts during cold storage could protect SECs and ameliorate hepatic I/R injury. Rat liver grafts were preserved in University of Wisconsin (UW) solution containing 5% CO (CO\u2010UW solution) for 18 to 24 hours and were transplanted into syngeneic Lewis rats. After 18 hours of cold preservation, SEC damage was evident with propidium iodide (PI) nuclear staining on SECs, and the frequency of PI+ SECs was significantly lower in grafts stored in CO\u2010UW solution versus those stored in control UW solution. SEC protection with CO was associated with decreased intercellular cell adhesion molecule translocation and less matrix metalloproteinase release during cold preservation. After LTx with 18 hours of cold preservation, serum alanine aminotransferase levels and hepatic necrosis were significantly less in the CO\u2010UW group than in the control UW group. With 24 hours of cold storage, 35% (7/20) survived with control UW solution, whereas the survival with CO\u2010UW solution improved to 80% (8/10).

In the first part (Chapter 2) we stress the role of the oceans as a sink for atmospheric carbon by developing a dynamic global carbon cycle model with two reservoirs containing atmosphere and two ocean layers. We consider a special form of carbon capture and storage: The capture of carbon and its sequestration into the deep ocean reservoir. Adding a non-renewable \nresource stock we study the socially optimal extraction and carbon capture and storage decision rules. We show that carbon capture and storage accelerates the slow natural flux within the carbon cycle, and because of its temporary abatement character it dampens the overshooting of the atmospheric reservoir. After studying the decentralized economy we show that the optimal carbon tax has an \ninverted u-shape. Depending on the initial sizes of the reservoirs and the speed of carbon fluxes between the reservoirs carbon taxes can also be increasing, decreasing or u-shaped. Our model is the first of its kind which can generate this result. Furthermore, we conclude that the level of the carbon tax should be positively adjusted to account for (i) damage uncertainty and (ii) the declining ability of the deep ocean to absorb atmospheric carbon. \n \nIn the second part of the thesis (Chapter 3) we apply standardized numerical techniques of stochastic optimization to the climate change issue. We ask the question how the optimal mitigation of climate change evolves if intrinsic uncertainty about damage is inherent to the model. In particular, we are interested in how the effect of uncertainty on climate change mitigation changes with \ndifferent levels of risk aversion. \n \nA major finding is that the effects of stochasticity differ even in \nsign as to emission control with varying parameters: introduction of \nstochasticity may increase or decrease emission control depending on \nthe specific parameter setting. Our analysis covers a large range of \nthe parameter space, in particular the degree of risk aversion and \nthe level of uncertainty. We identify regions of the state space for \nwhich higher levels of uncertainty or risk aversion result in \ndifferent policy rules for emission control. Similarly, given a \ncertain state of the world we conclude that the effect of \nuncertainty on emission control changes (in level and sign) with the \ndegree of risk aversion. In other words, uncertainties in climatic \ntrends may induce people's precautionary emission reduction but also \nmay drive away money from abatement. \n \nIn the third part of the thesis (Chapter 4) we are interested in how \na capital stock which is linked to a polluting technology is \nmaintained, accumulated and utilized optimally. In order to analyze \nthe inter- and intra-sectoral tradeoffs between capacity building \nand capacity using which guide the economy's transition process \ntowards a balanced growth equilibrium we develop a model with two \nproduction sectors that generate a homogenous consumption good. The \nproduction processes in these two sectors differ with respect to the \ntechnology which is used. While in one sector the process is clean, \ngenerating output in the other sector also creates environmental \ndamage. The technologies are completely embedded in the \ncorresponding stock of physical capital. Hence, the application of \none technology can only be intensified by investing more in the \nassociated capital stock or utilizing it more intensively. \n \nOur findings show that the combination of heterogeneous capital, \nendogenous depreciation and capital intensity is essential for \nextracting qualitative and quantitative implications for policy \nmakers about the easiness of a technology switch. If the economic \nenvironment requires a change in the energy portfolio, an economy \ndriven by our model structure can not react without severe time \nlags, due to the ex post clay nature of investment. Installation of \nthe desired capital stock simply takes time if we do not want to \nabstain from smooth consumption patterns. In a next step we \nintroduce a stock of carbon which is subject to uncertainty. With \nthis modification we can investigate how uncertainty about damage \nresulting from climate change influences the optimal interplay \nbetween capacity building and capacity utilization in a more \nrealistic environment. We conclude that increasing uncertainty \nintensifies the need for a rapid build-up of the clean capital \nstock. It also reduces the demand for effective capital services \nassociated with the polluting technology.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "963b5297b2d803af0fd6f8f6306dd8d3873cdf5b", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 168168642}, "title": "ScienceDirect European Geosciences Union General Assembly 2013 , EGU Division Energy , Resources & the Environment , ERE Underground coal gasification and CO 2 storage support", "abstract": "Underground coal gasification facilitates the utilization of deep-seated coals that are economically not exploitable via conventional mining.

For Germany this means a reduction of greenhouse gases by 21% till this period. But the government went still beyond this goal. In Bali 2007 a national climate protection programme was presented with the national target to reduce the anthropogenic CO2 emissions by 40% until 2020 under the precondition that the EU reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 30%. Beside energy efficiency and renewables, CO2 Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an important CO2 mitigation option in Germany and a crucial part of the new Integrated Energy and Climate Programme (IEKP) started by the German Federal Government in 2007. In the fiscal year 2008 about 3.3 Billion Euros are available for this programme.

The latter topic is addressed in the framework of the German COORETEC-Programme, funded by the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology. Due to the successful and promising results of the first funding phase, the Federal Ministry of Education and Research took over the responsibility for all R&D-activities in terms of CO2-Storage. For the next three years 45 Million Euros will be provided for future R&D-activities, carried out in the R&D-Programme GEOTECHNOLOGIEN. All activities are public-private-partnerships and pursue a two-step-strategy, which moves from labto field-scale projects. Basic R&D-activities are focussed on the enhancement of scientific and technological knowledge on a broad scale. They remain predominantly on the laboratory scale. After a public call and an international peerreview 14 joint-projects between academia and industry have been started in spring 2008. The overall budget for a three year funding phase is about 19 Million Euro. 13 Mio derive from the Ministry, another 6 Million Euro are contributed by the industrial partners. Site specific pilot projects are focussed on a deep saline aquifer in Northern Germany and a depleted gas field in the Altmark area, Sachsen-Anhalt. The Altmark gasfield is the second largest natural gas field in Europe with a potential storage capacity of 500 million metric tons of CO2 and is an ideal area to study enhanced gas recovery and safe storage of CO2. This paper gives an overview of the recent status concerning the implementation of large-scale CCS demonstration power plants in Germany. Emphasis is on the R&D-activities on geological storage of CO2. In addition, this paper covers the most recent discussions on the legal framework and public outreach activities for the projected CO2 storage sites. Session: ICPWS XV / 11.

Carbon capture storage (CCS) technology which involves carbonation of carbon dioxide into calcium carbonate with the aid of calcium oxide adsorbent is widely applied.

During this project, calcium oxide and calcium oxide-nickel oxide adsorbents were successfully synthesised through sol-gel method. The data needed for this analysis was obtained from carbonation of adsorbents at temperatures of 400, 500 and 600 oC with the aid of Thermogravimetric Analyser (TGA). The results showed that high adsorption rate and adsorption capacity could be achieved at the initial stage, chemical reactioncontrolled stage, at higher carbonation temperature as well as by addition of NiO catalyst.

A typical CO2 sequestration project comprises capturing CO2 by separating from produced hydrocarbons followed by injection of CO2 into deep geological formations for long term storage. While injection ofCO2 may continue over tens of years, the long-term containment needs to be ascertained for thousands of years. Several geological and geophysical factors along with the existingwells need to be evaluated to assess the potential risks for CO2 leakage that maychallenge the long-term containment.\n This study considers a depleted carbonate field located offshore Sarawak as a possible long-term CO2 storage site. Elements that may lead to possible leakage of CO2over time are the existing faults or fractures, development of new fractures/faults during injection, caprock failure due to pressures exceeding fracture pressure during/after injection and possible leakage through existing wells. The risk assessment process includes identification and mapping of faults and fracture networks, mapping of seals, evaluation of seismic anomalies and gas while drilling records, pore-pressure analysis, laboratory experiments for analyzing changes in geomechanical & geochemical rock properties and well integrity of existing wells. All these parameters are cross correlated, and qualitative risk categorization is carried out to determine the robustness of the reservoir for long term CO2 storage.\n The evaluation of available data indicates less frequent faulting occur only towards the flank with no seismic anomalies associated with them. Some seismic anomalies are observed at shallower levels, however their impact on the reservoir and overburden integrity is assessed to be minimum. There are four shale dominated formations mapped in the overburden section, which will act as potential seals. Estimated fracture pressures for the potential seals ranges between 6200-9280 psia for the deepest seal to 2910-4290 psia for the shallowest. Therefore,it is interpreted that if the post injection reservoir pressure is kept below the initial reservoir pressure of 4480 psia, it would not hold any threat to the caprock integrity.Leakage rate riskalong the existing wells was determined based on well log data. Well integrity check of legacywells helped identify two abandoned wells for rigorous remediation to restore their integrity.\n The subsurface risk analysis is critical to ascertain the long-term containment of injectedCO2. The integrated subsurface characterization and well integrity analysis approach adopted in this work can be applied to any other field/reservoir to validate its robustness for long-term CO2 injection and storage.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "288c245b8ee7ac4554e28064013d889cb5b008ec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2706575845", "DOI": "10.1007/s10973-017-6542-7", "CorpusId": 103173527}, "title": "CO2 capture on activated carbons derived from mango fruit (Mangifera indica L.) seed shells", "abstract": "Activated carbons were prepared from mango (Mangifera indica L.) fruit seed shells and used as CO2 capture adsorbents.

The aim of this modelling study is to examine how changes in litter quality/quantity and root exudation \u2013- if they occur \u2013- will affect the CO2 responses of net primary productivity and ecosystem carbon (C) storage on different timescales. We apply a model of C and N cycling in forest ecosystems (G\u2019DAY) to stands of Norway spruce (Picea abies, L. Cast) growing at a N-limited experimental site at Flakaliden, Sweden, and draw the following conclusions: (1) in the absence of changes in litter quality and root exudation, the short-term CO2 stimulus of litter quantity leads to only a minimal CO2 stimulus of productivity or C storage in the medium term (\u2248 20 years) and long term (\u2248 200 years), because of constraints on soil N availability; (2) increasing plant nitrogen use efficiency (via a decrease in the N:C ratio of new litter) makes little impact on these results; (3) a significant CO2 response in the medium term requires a substantial decrease in the N:C ratio of older litter, when it is approaching stabilisation as soil organic matter, although the long-term CO2 response remains small; and (4) an increase in N fixation leads to a small effect on productivity in the short term, but a very large effect on both productivity and C storage in the long term. These results suggest that soil N constraints on the long-term CO2-fertilisation effect can be overcome to a significant extent only by increases in N acquisition, although only modest increases may be required.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "a7df63a3d42ca8730e804d610e99bfdae2c23af6", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 244659258}, "title": "Continuum scale modelling of salt precipitation in the context of CO2 storage in saline aquifers with MRST compositional", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) would contribute considerably towards climate change mitigation, if it would be implemented on a very large scale; at many storage sites with substantial injection rates. Achieving high injection rates in deep saline aquifers requires a detailed assessment of injectivity performance and evaluation of the processes that alter the permeability of the near-well region. One of the most common forms of the injectivity loss in the context of CO2 storage in saline aquifers is salt precipitation driven by the evaporation of brine into the relatively dry injected CO2 stream. We present a novel compositional transport formulation based on overallcomposition variables which models salt as a separate solid phase which could potentially form through two essentially different ways, i.e., kinetic or equilibrium. To model formation drying-out and subsequent haliteprecipitation, an accurate and reliable fluid model ePC-SAFT, which can effectively account for ionic effects, is applied. In addition, a volume balance approach (i.e., depending on how far the salt saturation is from the solubility limit) is implemented to estimate solid saturation in a simulation cell. The resulting simulator is benchmarked against several well-known examples, with analytical solutions demonstrating the ability of the code to cover a variety of physical mechanisms. Finally, injection of dry CO2 into a brine-saturated core-scale domain is simulated and sensitivity analyses over various parameters are performed.

The objective of this study was to quantify and characterize soil organic carbon (SOC) and nitrogen (N) in mountain wet meadows across ranges of meadow hydrology and livestock utilization.Materials and methodsEighteen wetlands in the southern Sierra Nevada Mountains representing a range of wetness and livestock utilization levels were selected for soil sampling. In each wetland meadow, whole-solum soil cores delineated by horizon were analyzed for total and dissolved organic C (DOC) total (TN) and mineral nitrogen and soil water content (SWC). Multiple regression and GIS analysis was used to estimate the role of wet meadows in C storage across the study area landscape.Results and discussionAverage solum SOC contents by wetland ranged from 130 to 805\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121. All SOC and TN components were highly correlated with SWC. Regression analyses indicated subtle impacts of forage utilization level on SOC and TN concentrations, but not on whole-solum, mass-per-area stocks of SOC and TN. Proportions of DOC and TN under seasonally wet meadows increased with increasing utilization. GIS analysis indicated that the montane landscape contains about 54.3\u00a0Mg SOC ha\u22121, with wet meadows covering about 1.7% of the area and containing about 12.3% of the SOC.ConclusionsResults indicate that soil organic C and N content of meadows we sampled are resilient to current light to moderate levels of grazing.

In this paper, we evaluate the environmental performance of two similarly structured combined-cycle power plants with pre-combustion capture. The fi rst power plant performs methane steam reforming in an autothermal reformer, while the second plant uses a reactor that includes a hydrogen-separating membrane. The two plants are compared both to one another and to a business-as-usual scenario using six environmental impact potentials (abiotic depletion, global warming, ozone layer depletion, photochemical oxidant formation, acidifi cation, and eutrophication). The goal is to pinpoint environmental weaknesses and strengths of the two capture technologies. We fi nd that the two plants result in similar impacts, decreasing the contribution to global warming of conventional operation but, at the same time, increasing other impacts, such as ozone layer depletion and photochemical oxidant formation. Additionally, the two capture plants result in higher cumulative non-renewable and total energy demands, as well as in lower life-cycle energy balances and effi ciencies. The most direct measure to decrease the environmental impacts of the examined techniques would be to increase their effi ciency, by decreasing the requirements of the processes in natural and energy resources. \u00a9 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "4b51f72db1f8c60e29b4ccc3fe77144fce8e88d5", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1109/SIEDS52267.2021.9483714", "CorpusId": 236188767}, "title": "Integrated Carbon Capture and Utilization Evaluation for U.S. Microbreweries", "abstract": "The brewing process for beer production both utilizes and emits carbon dioxide (CO2).

Mangroves are widely recognised as key ecosystems for climate change mitigation as they capture and store significant amounts of sediment organic carbon (SOC). Yet, there is incomplete knowledge on how sources of SOC and their differential preservation vary between mangrove sites in relation to environmental gradients. To address this, sediment depth profiles were sampled from mangrove sites ranging from river-dominated to marine-dominated sites and including old and young mangrove sites, in the Guayas delta (Ecuador). The stable carbon isotope ratios (\u03b413C) and the elemental composition (OC%, C\u2009:\u2009N) of sediment profiles, local vegetation (i.e., autochthonous carbon) and externally-supplied suspended particulate matter (i.e., allochthonous carbon) were obtained to assess variations in the amount and sources of SOC at different locations throughout the delta. In general, across all sites, we found increasing SOC contents and stocks are associated with decreasing \u03b413C and increasing C\u2009/\u2009N ratios, indicating that SOC stocks and sources are intrinsically related. The SOC stocks (down to 0.64\u2009m deep profiles) are significantly lower in young mangrove sites (46\u201355\u2009Mg\u2009C\u2009ha\u22121) than in old sites (78\u201392\u2009Mg\u2009C\u2009ha\u22121). The SOC in the young mangrove sites is mainly of allochthonous origin (estimated on average at 79\u2009%) whereas in the old sites there is a slight dominance of autochthonous OC (on average 59\u2009%). Moreover, from river- to marine-dominated sites, a pattern was found of increasing SOC stocks and increasing autochthonous SOC contribution. These observed differences along the two studied gradients are hypothesized to be mainly driven by (1) expected higher sedimentation rates in the river-dominated and lower-elevation younger sites, thereby \u201cdiluting\u201d the SOC content and decreasing the relative autochthonous contribution; and (2) potential differences in preservation of the different SOC sources. Our finding of high contributions of allochthonous SOC, especially in young mangroves, implies that this carbon is not originating from CO2 sequestration by the mangrove ecosystem itself, but is externally supplied from other terrestrial, marine or estuarine ecosystems. We argue that accounting for lower SOC stocks and higher contribution of allochthonous SOC in young and river-dominated mangrove sites, as compared to old and marine-dominant sites, is particularly relevant for designing and valuing nature-based climate mitigation programs based on mangrove reforestation.\n", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "6f26311276debb1847e78d70b0928e0f51e880c4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2942466543", "DOI": "10.1007/978-981-13-3504-4_7", "CorpusId": 150050653}, "title": "Zeolites and Other Adsorbents", "abstract": "Zeolites are crystalline nanoporous aluminosilicates, which have been used as selective and efficient catalysts and adsorbents in several industrial applications.
