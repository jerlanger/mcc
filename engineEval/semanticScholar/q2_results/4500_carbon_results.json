This dissertation addresses the aforementioned issue and provides two solutions. 1) An e cient Natural Gas (NG) based Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) power plant equipped with near 100% carbon dioxide capture. The power plant uses a unique refrigeration based process to capture and liquefy carbon dioxide from the SOFC exhaust. Here, carbon dioxide is captured and condensed at di\u21b5erent pressure levels by contacting the gas stream with liquid carbon dioxide reflux generated at higher pressure. The uncondensed gas mixture, comprising of relatively high purity unconverted fuel, is recycled to the SOFC and found to boost up the power generation of the SOFC by 22%, when compared to a stand alone SOFC. If Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) is available at the plant gate, then the refrigeration available from its evaporation is used for carbon dioxide Capture and Liquefaction (CO2CL). If NG is utilized, then a Mixed Refrigerant (MR) vapor compression cycle is utilized for CO2CL. Alternatively, the necessary refrigeration can be supplied by evaporating the captured liquid carbon dioxide at a lower pressure, which is then compressed to supercritical pressures for pipeline transportation. From rigorous simulations, the power generation e ciency of the proposed processes is found to be 70-76% on a lower heating value (LHV) basis.

The model structure and submodels are described. Results are presented for the steady-state simulation of a two-metric-tonne-per-day (2 tpd) laboratory-scale Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) gasifier, fed by two different types of coal. Improvements over the state-of-the-art for reduced order modeling include the ability to incorporate realistic flow conditions and hence predict the gasifier internal and external temperature profiles, the ability to easily interface the model with plant-wide flowsheet models, and the flexibility to apply the same model to a variety of entrained flow gasifier designs.

INTRODUCTION Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is recognized as one of a suite of technology options that can be used to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from continued fossil fuel usage [1-3]. Several approaches to carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, the most expensive step in CCS, have been suggested, among them, pre-combustion CO2 capture systems, which employ gasification. Applications of gasification-based energy systems include IGCC plants for the production of power, and polygeneration plants for the production of industrial chemicals, fuels, hydrogen, and potentially power. There are three general families of commercial gasifier designs: fixed/moving bed, fluidized bed and entrained flow. According to the DOE/NETL 2007 Gasification Database, nearly all planned gasifiers will be of the entrained flow family [4]. The primary reasons for this are: high throughputs, high carbon conversions and very low concentrations of tars and hydrocarbons associated with entrained flow gasifiers (EFGs) [5]. Important characteristics of the main EFG designs are shown in Table 1. However, there are significant technical challenges associated with the operation of EFGs. Foremost among these are: 1. Lack of dynamic feedstock flexibility: changes in feedstock composition can lead to unacceptable syngas composition changes and unpredictable slag behavior. 2. Injector failure: high flame temperature and high particle velocities lead to short injector life. This is particularly true for slurry-fed designs. 3. Slag behavior: even under normal operating conditions, slag can freeze, causing corrosion and blockages inside the gasifier.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "a3b821edf596fa5e0972add4b6c90df503eeab9c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3085183450", "CorpusId": 221727544}, "title": "The future of (negative) emissions trading in the European Union", "abstract": "Under the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), operators must surrender allowances corresponding to the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) from their installations. The supply of allowances in the EU ETS decreases linearly and, all else equal, is expected to end around 2057. An earlier cut-off date is likely to follow from the European Council's recent decision that the EU should reach net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Scenarios published by the European Commission even anticipate a net-negative cap in the EU ETS from 2045 onwards, generated through carbon dioxide (CO2) removals. Upholding emissions trading, in the long run, therefore entails significant use of credits resulting from atmospheric CO2 removal activities. However, in its current form, the ETS Directive does not contain any legal basis for generating CO2 removal credits. Integrating CO2 removal into the EU ETS would, thus, require fundamental amendments of the ETS Directive, waiving the currently mandatory association binding emitting activities to the adoption of emission abatement technologies. The next policy window for such amendments will open in 2021, following the decision on a more ambitious EU 2030 emission reduction target. This conceptual paper explores various design options for integrating negative emissions technologies (NETs) into the EU ETS. We discuss their potential implications for emissions trading at large and address the specificity of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS); repealing the provision that installations exclusively using biomass are not covered by the ETS Directive, BE(CCS) installations could in principle fall within the scope of the ETS Directive. Theoretically, it would be possible to consider free allocation of biogenic credits to BE(CCS) installations. Bioenergy operators could avoid having to surrender these biogenic allowances through the use of CCS and instead sell them on the EU ETS market, having implicitly received credits for the removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "051fa1fadb166cfe02da83217da61ccf06ad8b6a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2895643654", "CorpusId": 169558509}, "title": "Solving the communicator's dilemma for Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "Like many other emerging technologies, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) has uncertain impacts, unfamiliar risks and ambiguous societal roles. These risks and uncertainties can spark controversy and public negativity. Consequently, its desirability may become contested and public support may falter. The public should be engaged in CCS development to unearth budding areas of conflict, steer development in societally beneficial directions and foster trust in institutions. In engaging citizens, communicators face the communicator\u2019s dilemma: communicators that include too few message components may omit crucial information, while communicators that include too many components may dilute their message\u2019s persuasiveness. To solve this dilemma, we posed the following research question: What message components influence the effectiveness of messages that support or oppose CCS for different groups of citizens? To answer the research question, we carried out four empirical studies, tackling four literature gaps: the limited understanding of the effects of (a) arguments in the CCS discourse, (b) moral considerations, (c) the relative importance of message components, and (d) heterogeneity among citizens. Our results show that knowledge deficit strategies to communication are suboptimal. Many stakeholders believe that injecting citizens with accurate knowledge will induce positive opinions about CCS. However, such strategies are unlikely to engage citizens, risk alienating key audiences and neglect the trade-offs policy makers need to make between values, risks, costs and benefits. Our results show that communicators should instead appeal to norms, such as properly disposing of CO2 waste, focus on the consequences of developing CCS, and discuss how citizens will be involved in decision making. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) can contribute substantially to climate change mitigation. Yet, citizens find pro CCS arguments about this contribution relatively unpersuasive and unimportant. Furthermore, citizens find arguments that dispute this contribution relatively persuasive and important, especially those arguments that appeal to the norm that prevention is better than a cure. Citizens react more positively to the message when communicators discuss the consequences of climate change and explicitly mention that CCS is part of a portfolio of mitigation options. To engage citizens, communicators should discuss additional benefits of CCS development, such as economic benefits, address the uncertainties surrounding CCS and provide explicit reasoning for why CCS can provide these benefits. Given the diversity of citizens, communicators should craft distinct storylines, focusing, for example, on safety and uncertainties or the role of CCS in the energy mix. Although communication to the public is a vital component of public engagement, our results show that communication has limited effects, dissipates over time and often has unintended consequences, such as the boomerang effect.

In this paper, we apply Multichannel Coherency Migration (MCM) to automatically locate microseismic events of induced and volcano-tectonic seismicity using sparse and irregular monitoring arrays. Compared to other migration-based methods, in spite of the often sparse and irregular distribution of the monitoring arrays, the MCM can show better location performance and obtain more consistent location results with the catalogue obtained by manual picking. Our MCM method successfully locates many triggered volcano-tectonic events with local magnitude smaller that 0, which demonstrates its applicability on locating very small earthquakes. Our synthetic event location example at a carbon capture and storage site shows that continuous and coherent drilling noise in industrial settings will pose great challenges for source imaging.

Our analysis takes explicitly into account that the supply of electricity at the wholesale level (generation) is organized competitively in some U.S. jurisdictions, while in others a regulated utility provides integrated generation and distribution services. For either market structure, we find that emissions charges in the range of $25-$30 per tonne of CO2 would be the break-even value for adopting CCS capabilities at new coal-fired power plants. The corresponding break-even values for natural gas plants are substantially higher, near $60 per tonne. Our break-even estimates serve as a basis for projecting the change in electricity prices once carbon emissions become costly. CCS capabilities effectively put an upper bound on the rise in electricity prices. We estimate this bound to be near 30% at the retail level for both coal and natural gas plants. In contrast to the competitive power supply scenario, however, these price increases materialize only gradually for a regulated utility.

Worldwide efforts to reduce emissions by creating a more efficient, carbon-free energy system may not be enough to stabilize the climate and avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR), sometimes referred to as negative emissions technologies, likely will be needed to meet the global goal of limiting warming to well below 2\u00b0 degrees C, compared to pre-industrial levels, as established by the Paris Agreement. In 2019, the National Academies published a report that laid out a research agenda for advancing a variety of landand coastal-based CDR approaches and specifically, for assessing their benefits, risks, and sustainable scale potential. The study found that, to meet climate goals, some form of CDR will likely be needed to remove roughly 10Gt CO2/yr by mid-century and 20Gt CO2/yr by the end of the century. To help meet that goal, the report identified four land-based CDR approaches ready for large-scale deployment: afforestation/reforestation, changes in forest management, uptake and storage by agricultural soils, and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, based on thepotential to remove carbon at costs below $100/t of CO2.

The concept would be widely applied to any post-combustion CO2 capture process.

Prolonged use of energy cannot be taken for granted. Concerns about energy security in the EU are growing and energy is a main driver behind climate change and local air pollution. A more sustainable energy policy can improve on energy security and reduce environmental impacts, like air pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions. Such policies incur costs to society, and may deteriorate economic growth and competitiveness. This requires a policy-mix that serves to achieve multiple goals and thus increases the efficiency of EU-policy. There is a large scope for synergy between policies related to climate, air pollution and energy security. The mix of options and policies that maximizes this synergy can significantly improve the efficiency of EU policy. Attractive options-from the viewpoint of synergies-include efficiency and more renewables. Trade-offs may occur; e.g. coal use to enhance energy security may result in higher greenhouse gas emissions (unless in combination with gasification and carbon capture and storage). Another example concerns bio-energy technologies, which reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, but not necessarily those of other air pollutants. The ancillary benefits of greenhouse gas abatement policies are significant. In the case of air pollution, these may even approximate the greenhouse gas abatement costs. There are costs involved in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing energy security, and avoiding damage from air pollution. Abatement costs for stringent climate policies are likely to be in the order of 1-2% of GDP by 2030, assuming broad international participation. A shrinking coalition size-while maintaining reduction targets for its members-will lead to higher abatement costs. Large greenhouse gas emission reductions in the EU-25 will also reduce the emissions of SO 2 , NO x , and Particulate Matter. This in turn will lower the chronic exposure of European citizens to these substances. And this again is likely to reduce the number of premature deaths, chronic bronchitis, and absence from work due to illness.

CCS is a 3-step process including: CO 2 capture by de-carbonisation of fossil fuels or separation from flue gases and from other gaseous mixtures; CO 2 transportation to the storage site-usually via pipelines; and CO 2 storage by injection of high-pressure supercritical CO 2 into geological formations, e.g. deep saline reservoirs, depleted oil and gas fields, and unmineable coal seams. In fossil fuels combustion processes, the CO 2 can be captured in pre-combustion mode (i.e. fossil fuels decarbonisation), in post-combustion mode (i.e. chemical separation from the flue gas), and by the oxyfuel combustion (i.e. fuel combustion in oxygen-rich atmosphere). Apart from combustion, CO 2 can also be separated from gaseous mixtures, e.g. in natural gas fields with high CO2 content or in chemical processes. The CCS is based on well-known technologies that, however, have never been applied to large-scale power or industrial plants. The five large-scale, industrial demonstration projects that are currently in operation use CO 2 sources other than power plants (e.g. easy available CO 2 from natural gas production or coal gasification). With a total storage capacity above 5 MtCO 2 /yr, these projects focus on CO 2 geological storage rather than on CO 2 capture. In North America, CO 2 injection and storage is also used for EOR where the additional production of oil offsets the cost of CO 2 separation, transportation and injection. CCS applications in power generation are currently being demonstrated in relatively small (5 to 40 MW) pilot plants, with a number of full-scale projects underway or planned. \u0084 PERFORMANCE & COSTS-CCS can significantly reduce CO 2 emissions in power generation (85%) and in other industrial sectors. In general, CO 2 separation from natural gas wells is a relatively easy and cheap process, but CO 2 capture from combustion processes is rather expensive and energy-consuming. CCS application in power generation involves a reduction of the power plant efficiency, typically between 8 and 12 percentage points. This means that the addition of the CCS can reduce the efficiency of a coal power plants from 45% to 35%.

The current costs for implementing BECCS at this level is compared to the present carbon taxes and other incentives. We show that including BECCS in the carbon tax incentive mechanism at current incentive levels would yield 16.7 Mt of negative emissions annually with an estimated societal cost saving of more than 600 M e annually, when compared to current incentive marginal abatement costs. We conclude that Sweden is ideally positioned for immediate BECCS deployment.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "f24317381826b4158466c18926f652831b5fd660", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3041378371", "DOI": "10.4018/ijban.2020070104", "CorpusId": 225600761}, "title": "An Integrated Entropy-TOPSIS Methodology for Evaluating Green Energy Sources", "abstract": "This research aims to select the optimum green energy sources for sustainable planning from a given set of alternatives.

There has been widespread recognition, reinforced by the predictions of international bodies such as the International Energy Agency and the European Commission, that coal will continue to be used in increasing, not diminishing, quantities for power generation, particularly in parts of the world including the USA, China, India and Europe, which have large resources of the fuel. In parallel, it has become increasingly urgent to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide because of its impact as a greenhouse gas on climate change. Whereas previously it might have been thought in the UK, and indeed in Europe more widely, that coal generation could be dispensed with and replaced by gas fired generation and renewables, it is now widely recognised, for example in The Stern Review, that coal fired generation needs to be cleaned up by the use of clean coal technology and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) rather than substituted. During 2006, the shortage of gas, the disruption of supplies via the Ukraine in the winter and the price hikes in March and July resulted in a loss of confidence in gas supplies and confirmed that long term dependence on gas imports is inadvisable. There is also recognition now that gas fired generation will also need to be much cleaner if global CO2 targets are to be met. Replacement of coal by gas will not be sufficient for climate change mitigation. Carbon dioxide capture and storage will be needed on gas fired as well as coal fired power stations. EU and UK politicians and officials are now discussing the whole power generation mix and not just the part which renewables may play. The UK 2007 Energy White Paper and the EU Energy Package each point to the need for a diverse portfolio of energy sources for power generation to achieve security of supplies. Both emphasise the vital importance of coal in the generation mix and recognise cleaner coal has an essential role alongside energy efficiency, renewables, and nuclear in reducing emissions. The UK government has set up the Coal Forum with the objective \u2018to help find solutions to secure the long-term future of coal-fired power generation and UK coal production\u2019. The predicted reduction in the use of coal is no longer as steep as was envisaged. In 2006, 34% of the UK\u2019s electricity was generated by coal, approximately the same as in 2003. Indeed for three months in the winter of 2006 half of the UK\u2019s electricity was generated from coal. About 75% by capacity of the UK\u2019s coal fired power stations have opted in to the large combustion plant directive (LCPD) and, with flue gas desulphurisation fitted, most will remain open to 2015 and beyond, contributing to security of supplies (see Fig. 1). Clean coal technologies were previously considered synonymous with gasification (IGCC) but now are seen to include a number of conversion technologies (including advanced supercritical boilers, fluidised beds and gasification) and a number of CO2 capture technologies (including postcombustion solvent absorption, oxyfuel firing and precombustion), all of which are likely to play a role in the plant mix since clean coal technologies are needed for existing plant (including recent plant in China, USA and Europe) as well as future plant. It is now widely anticipated that any new plant in Europe will be required to be capture ready. Alongside capture ready plant, a number of first of class CCS projects (often referred to as demonstration projects) are envisaged. The EU Directorates for Transport and Energy, Environment and Research are each backing an industry strategy, published by the European Technology Platform \u2018Zero-emissions Power Plant\u2019 (ETP ZEP), for 10 to 12 such demonstrations around Europe, to be operational by 2015. DG Environment and DEFRA/DTI in the UK are pushing ahead with the necessary regulations for CCS and clarification of the London Convention (now implemented) and OSPAR to allow storage beneath the ocean floor. Following consultation in 2005, in February 2006, the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology published its findings on CCS, recommending early action on demonstration projects. The Treasury carried out a consultation on incentives for CCS and has announced a competition for Demonstration project(s) in the autumn 2007. Relatively recently it seemed that all of the new power plant required in the UK would be renewables (mostly wind) and gas (including CHP) and that there was plenty of time to build these plants. Now, the risks to future power supplies have become much clearer. The emergence of a gap by the end of 2015, caused by closures of Magnox nuclear stations (2.3 GW), opted out coal and oil stations (11 GW) and growth of demand (7 GW at 1% per year) is now recognised. The gap will be greater by 5 GW if the AGRs at Hunterston, Hinkley Point B, Hartlepool and Heysham do not achieve life extension (see Fig. 2). It has become accepted that there are limitations to the amount of renewables that can be incorporated on the grid, that it is becoming too late for new nuclear to make a significant contribution before 2016 and that the generation gap, which is now widely recognised as being 20\u201329 GW, will need to be filled Doosan Babcock Energy Limited, Renfrew, UK", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "6812ec166370c151302d233ccc257a3baa4ebab2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2811231134", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-66981-6_33", "CorpusId": 169733289}, "title": "Role of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) or Use (CCU) on Climate Mitigation", "abstract": "ArcelorMittal, world leader in steel production, is working together with industrial partners from the cement and chemical industries, other energy intensive sectors, for potential synergies between the respective manufacturing processes and how these could contribute to the reduction of overall CO2 emissions.

Indeed, one of the main causes of global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, including mainly CO2. Several ways have been found to gradually reduce the CO2 emissions, among them the Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) process. This is a technique which extends the use of fossil energies while giving necessary time for renewable energies to develop on a large scale. The CO2 is captured, brought to the storage site, and injected either into dried up oil and gas deposits or into unworkable coal seams or into deep saline aquifers. Long-term monitoring of the storage site is maintained afterward. The question pending, and a source of controversy, relates to the underground evolution of the CO2 in the medium- and long-term. The aim is to lead preliminary determination of risks on a generic basis. Projects are managed and storage installations built on a global scale. Depending on the country, the risk approach is not the same. Mostly, only the FEP method is used - accident scenarios are built up based on several events and cumulated processes. This study develops the MOSAR method (Organized and Systemic Method of Risk Analysis) to analyse the technical risks of a human plant and to identify the prevention means to neutralize them. The innovative side of this work is that we have created a typology grid of under-systems hazard sources adapted to a CO2 geological storage site. Risk scenarios can then be built and organized hierarchically in a grid by means of gravity based on probability. Once this is done, this study leads to the identification of prevention and protection means. Similar to most systemic methods for risk analysis, this MOSAR method is time consuming in order to define all risks and scenarios.

However, the effects of tillage method or straw return on soil organic C (SOC) have showed inconsistent results in different soil/climate/ cropping systems. Soil TOC and labile organic C fractions contents were significantly affected by straw returns, and were higher under straw return treatments than non-straw return at three depths. The soil organic carbon (SOC) stock in bulk soil was 40.2-51.1% higher in the 0.00-0.05 m layer and 11.3-17.0% lower in the 0.05-0.20 m layer in NT system no-tillage without straw (NT-S) and with straw (NT+S), compared to the MP system moldboard plow without straw (MP-S) and with straw (MP+S), respectively. Residue incorporation caused a significant increment of 15.65% in total water stable aggregates in surface soil (0\u2013 15 cm) and 7.53% in sub-surface soil (15\u201330 cm). In surface soil, the maximum (19.2%) and minimum (8.9%) proportion of total aggregated carbon was retained with >2 mm and 0.1\u20130.05 mm size fractions, respectively. At 0\u20137 cm depth, soil MBC was significantly higher under plowing tillage than rotary tillage, but EOC was just opposite. Rotary tillage had significantly higher soil TOC than plowing tillage at 7\u201314 cm depth. However, at 14\u2013 21 cm depth, TOC, DOC and MBC were significantly higher under plowing tillage than rotary tillage except for EOC. A considerable proportion of the total SOC was found to be captured by the macro-aggregates (>2\u20130.25 mm) under both surface (67.1%) and sub-surface layers (66.7%) leaving rest amount in micro-aggregates and \u201esilt + clay\u201f sized particles. Application of inorganic fertilizer could sustain soil organic carbon (SOC) concentrations, whereas long-term application of manure alone or combined with NPK (M and NPK + M) significantly increased SOC contents compared with the unfertilized control. Manure application significantly increased the proportion of large macro-aggregates (> 2000 \u03bcm) compared with the control, while leading to a corresponding decline in the percentage of micro-aggregates (53\u2013250 \u03bcm). Carbon storage in the intra-aggregate particulate organic matter within micro-aggregates was enhanced from 9.8% of the total SOC stock in the control to 19.7% and 18.6% in the M and NPK + M treatments, respectively. The shift in SOC stocks towards micro-aggregates is beneficial for long-term soil C sequestration. Moreover, the differences in the micro-aggregate protected C accounted, on average, for 39.8% of the differences in total SOC stocks between the control and the manure-applied treatments. Thus, we suggest that the micro-aggregate protected C is promising for assessing the impact of conventional and conservation agriculture on SOC storage in the vertisol. Soil disturbance by tillage leads to destruction of the protective soil aggregate. This in turn exposes the labile C occluded in these aggregates to microbial breakdown. The present study found that SOC change was significantly influenced by the crop residue retention rate and the edaphic variable of initial SOC content.

The matter antimatter reaction represents the densest form of energy storage/release known to modem physics: as such it offers one of the most compact sources of power for future deep space exploration. To take the first steps along this path, the NASA-MSFC is developing a storage system referred to as the High Performance Antiproton Trap (HiPAT) with a goal of maintaining 10_2particles for up to 18 days. Experiments have been performed with this hardware using normal matter (positive hydrogen ions) to assess the device's ability to hold charged particles. These ions are currently created using an electron gun method to ionize background gas; however, this technique is limited by the quantity that can be captured. To circumvent this issue, an ion source is currently being commissioned which will greatly increase the number of ions captured and more closely simulate actual operations expected at an antiproton production facility. Ions have been produced, stored for various time intervals, and then extracted against detectors to measure species, quantity and energy. Radio frequency stabilization has been tested as a method to prolong ion lifetime: results show an increase in the baseline 1/e lifetime of trapped particles from hours to days.

Indeed, nuclear power has many attractions. It is a mature and well-established technology, unlike, for example, carbon capture and storage. Improvements in its operation and reliability in recent years have been striking. It produces little carbon dioxide and can clearly, in principle, play a signi1\u20442cant role in combating global warming. Compared to coalgenerated electricity in particular, it is relatively clean, producing almost no emissions. Its energy output is not intermittent, as is the case with wind and solar. And though the overall costs of nuclear are rising, they are arguably competitive with other low-greenhousegas electric-generation alternatives.1 However, despite these many attractions, nuclear power seems to go forward only where governments heavily subsidize its operation, such as in China and India today. As Henry Sokolski has pointed out, \u201cNo private bank has yet chosen to fully 1\u20442nance a new nuclear reactor build; no private insurer has yet chosen to insure a nuclear plant against third party off-site damages.\u201d2 In the United States, almost all of the several nuclear plants that are now being considered for future deployment are in states with regulated utilities, where nuclear does not have to compete directly with other generation sources and where rate payers in the state assume much of any risk. Nuclear power growth is stagnant or negative in most of the industrialized countries, and there is still today, outside of China and India, almost no nuclear power in the developing countries. In 2007, world nuclear electricity generation dropped by 2 percent; in 2008, for the 1\u20442rst time in nuclear power\u2019s history, no new reactor was connected to the grid anywhere. This should all give one pause in dreaming of a nuclear renaissance. Several factors are pulling back on efforts to expand nuclear power: the very high capital costs inherent in nuclear power, especially given the large size of reactors driven by economies of scale; a continuing strong aversion to nuclear power by skeptical publics concerned with safety, with unresolved questions on how to handle radioactive wastes, and with the risks of nuclear proliferation, despite some recent improvements in favorability ratings; and the rise of Harold A.

We explore the potential to use low-carbon GeoEnergy resources and bioenergy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in the Midland Valley area to decarbonize the Scottish economy and society. The Midland Valley has a long history of geological resource extraction and, as a result, the geology of the region is well characterized. Geothermal energy and subsurface energy storage have the potential to be implemented. Some of them, such as gravity and heat storage, could re-use the redundant mining infrastructure to decrease investment costs. Hydrogen storage could be of particular interest as the Midland Valley offers the required caprock\u2013reservoir assemblages. BECCS is also a promising option to reduce overall CO2 emissions by between 1.10 and 4.40\u2005MtCO2\u2005a\u22121. The Midland Valley has enough space to grow the necessary crops, but CO2 storage will most likely be implemented in North Sea saline aquifers.

However, the pace of CCS projects has suffered from a less supportive business case. Utilization of CO2 for enhanced oil recovery (CO2 EOR) offers commercial opportunities owing to its economic profitability from incremental oil production offsetting the cost of CCS. This paper describes the prospect of CO2 EOR offsetting the cost of CCS at a coal-fired power plant. A coal-firedpower plant assumed to be commissioned in 2022 is selected as the basis of this study. The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) of this plant without CCS is estimated at US$ 6.4 cents/kWh and emits around 4.1 MtCO2/year. Integrating CCS to the selected coal power plant imposed additional costs associated with CO2 capture, transportation, and storage systems. The incremental costs are evaluated based on separation of 90%, 45%, and 22.5% of CO2 from the power plant flue gas. Under the 90% capture scenario, the LCOE raised more than double to 15.5 US cents/kWh which is primarily attributed to the energy penalty. A minimal reduction of 0.9 cents/kWh could bring the LCOE down below the ceiling price for geothermal. Reducing the CO2 capture percentage from 90% to 45% could reduce the LCOE to 11.2 US cents/kWh. Lowering the cost to 0.6 cents/kWh or more for this case would result in the LCOE below the state-owned electricity companys average cost of combined cycle gas turbine in 2012. Selling the captured CO2 under US$ 10 per tonne at the plant gate could help offset the cost.

Past experimental work has shown the ability of benzyl-disulfide to reversibly bind CO2. In the present work, the ability of benzyl-diselenide and benzyl-ditelluride to reversibly bind CO2 was compared to that of benzyl-disulfide using a density functional theory approach. The effect of solvent polarity on the thermodynamics of CO2 capture was also investigated. From the results it was found that benzyl-ditelluride offered the most thermoneutral pathway for CO2 capture and release, whereas benzyl-disulfide offered the least thermoneutral pathway for CO2 capture. Such thermoneutrality between steps has been stated to be an important property of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Regarding the various steps involved in CO2 capture, it was found at the present level of theory that after reduction of the benzyl-dichalcogenide compounds, the formed BnX- compounds bind to CO2 via a barrierless process and are therefore expected to efficiently capture CO2.

The shift from 2\u00b0C pathways to 1.5\u00b0C pathways would demand much more effort and pose greater challenges in terms of transformational changes required in the energy supply and demand sectors of Thailand. Carbon neutrality in the energy supply system would be achievable with negative emissions through the adoption of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). The strong deployment of renewable energy-based power generation would also aid in the rapid decarbonization of the energy supply sector. The demand sectors would face more challenges requiring rapid and extensive deployment of energy efficient and low carbon technologies. The commercial sector may need to undergo deep decarbonization in the 1.5\u00b0C scenarios by 2050 while the industrial and residential sectors will need to curb GHG emissions by a large amount even under 2\u00b0C scenarios. The transportation sector would face challenges in shifting from private to public modes of transport, including wide adoption of electric and biofuel vehicles, in order to achieve the 1.5\u00b0C target.

The latter are caused by land use conversion that began with the dawn of settled agriculture several millennia ago, and by fossil fuel combustion that began with the onset of the industrial revolution in about 1750. Emissions from land use conversion during the pre-industrial era until about 1850 are estimated at *320 Pg. Since 1850, emissions from fossil fuel combustion are estimated at *350 Pg and those from land use conversion at *150 Pg. These and other anthropogenic activities have caused drastic perturbation of the global carbon cycle with increase in the atmospheric C pool and an attendant decrease in the pedologic, biotic, and geologic (fossil fuel) pools. Together, the pedologic pool (4,000 Pg to 3 m depth) and the biotic pool (620 Pg), called the terrestrial pool, is the third largest pool, after the oceanic (38,000 Pg) and the geologic (*5,000 Pg). The depletion of the terrestrial C pool has created a C sink capacity which can be filled by conversion to a restorative land use and adoption of recommended soil, plant, and animal management practices. The process of transfer of atmospheric CO2 into the pedologic and biotic pools is called carbon sequestration. This natural process contrasts with that of the geoengineering techniques of carbon capture and storage (CCS) involving geologic and oceanic storage and mineral carbonation of CO2 into calcite etc. The strategy of biosequestration, in addition to being cost-effective, has numerous ancillary benefits. It is a truly win\u2013win option. Specifically, it improves soil quality, enhances agronomic productivity, and advances food security.

We, therefore, need to create a \u2018breathing space\u2019 by removing CO 2 from the atmosphere to curb the current rising trend, and also to remove the CO 2 we have pumped into the atmosphere already. But how can this be achieved? To date, two main approaches have been championed \u2013 the physical and the biological. Both carbon capture strategies have the potential to make a substantial impact on present levels of atmospheric CO 2 [1,2], but it should be borne in mind that they only have a finite capacity for CO 2 removal limited by the amount of CO 2 that can be stored either as solid or liquid CO 2 , in the case of physical methods, or after conversion to materials such as cellulose and lignin, in the case of biological ones. With these provisos in mind, let us look at the options available. Physical methods are exemplified by carbon capture and storage (CCS), an idea that has caught public attention. It sounds so sensible \u2013 remove and store the CO 2 as it is produced! However, CCS can only be applied where large amounts of CO 2 are being produced (i.e., in power stations) and therefore can remove only some of the CO 2 currently being produced, and none at all of the \u2018backlog\u2019. More perturbing still is the problem of how to transport and store the several billion tonnes of CO 2 produced by human activity every year. Even if this were to be achieved, there would always be the possibility of slow leakage of CO 2 back into the atmosphere from storage depots or even its catastrophic re-release on a massive scale. Finally, CCS has not been attempted commercially, there exist only pilot schemes or experiments to test the various components of CCS [2,3]; we have no idea if and how a full-scale CCS project would work. There are two main pathways for removal of CO 2 by biological means: marine and terrestrial. The first involves fertilization of the open sea on a large scale to promote the growth of algae.

The next decade is critical for technological innovation and deployment to meet mid-century carbon removal goals of 10\u221220 GtCO2/yr. Direct air capture (DAC) is positioned to play a critical role in carbon removal, yet remains under paced in deployment efforts, mainly because of high costs. This study outlines a roadmap for DAC cost reductions through the exploitation of low-temperature heat, recent U.S. policy drivers, and logical, regional end-use opportunities in the United States. Specifically, two scenarios are identified that allow for the production of compressed high-purity CO2 for costs \u2264$300/tCO2, net delivered with an opportunity to scale to 19 MtCO2/yr. These scenarios use thermal energy from geothermal and nuclear power plants to produce steam and transport the purified CO2 via trucks to the nearest opportunity for direct use or subsurface permanent storage. Although some utilization pathways result in the re-emission of CO2 and cannot be considered true carbon removal, they would provide economic incentive to deploying DAC plants at scale by mid-century. In addition, the federal tax credit 45Q was applied for qualifying facilities (i.e., producing \u2265100 ktCO2/yr). \u25a0 INTRODUCTION A number of recent studies have collectively emphasized the need to include negative emissions technologies in the portfolio of solutions required to prevent 2 \u00b0C warming by the year 2100. In particular, the National Academy of Sciences released a report in 2019 that outlined a number of negative emissions technologies that exist today costing less than or equal to $100/tCO2 removed and sequestered. 2 Some of these technologies include agricultural soil conservation practices; increased forest management; and waste biomass capture, processing, and distribution. They estimated that to meet global climate goals, 10 billion tonnes of CO2 (GtCO2) will need to be removed each year up to 2050, with 20 GtCO2 removal each year from 2050 up to 2100. Unprecedented levels of technology adoption and land use changes will be required to meet the short-term goals, whereas costlier or less developed technologies such as direct air capture (DAC), bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, and mineral carbonation will be required to achieve the larger-scale and longer-term removal rates that are anticipated in the second half of the century. However, for the larger scales to be realized by mid-century, deployment on the scale of thousands to millions of tonnes per year needs to take place today. There are two types of DAC currently being scaled to meet climate goals: (1) chemical liquid solvent DAC (i.e., Carbon Engineering) and (2) chemical solid sorbent DAC (i.e. Climeworks and Global Thermostat). Although differences exist, these technologies operate under the same premise: selective removal of CO2 from ambient air (\u223c400 ppm) by contact with a basic solution (chemical liquid solvents) or a basic modified surface (chemical solid sorbents). The CO2, now fixated in a carbonate or carbamate bond is liberated from the capture media through application of heat, producing highpurity CO2 and renewed solvent, or sorbent, capable of many cycles of CO2 removal. Regardless of technology, the average energy requirement is approximately 80% thermal and 20% electrical. In the case of chemical liquid solvent DAC, CO2 is ultimately captured via a carbonate pellet, which requires highReceived: January 23, 2020 Revised: May 13, 2020 Accepted: May 15, 2020 Published: May 15, 2020 Article pubs.acs.org/est \u00a9 XXXX American Chemical Society A https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.0c00476 Environ.

Unfortunately, heat of this quality is not available in industrial or power generation waste streams. Alternatively, solid sorbent regeneration requires much lower quality heat at approximately 100 \u00b0C, which may be accessible as waste heat in a variety of processes. This indicates that coupling solid sorbent DAC with waste heat sources has the potential to offset 80% of the process energy requirements. For these reasons, this study targets energy partnerships. Specifically, the use of waste heat from geothermal energy or a slip-stream from nuclear energy production to assess the viability of these low-carbon and lowcost heat sources for modular solid sorbent-based DAC. This can provide a necessary piece of the pathway required for immediate, cost-effective deployment of solid sorbent DAC. The scaling of DAC must start now and incentives to scale must be developed in tandem with deployment. To date, Climeworks has the only commercial-scale solid sorbent DAC plants worldwide collectively removing several thousands of tonnes of CO2 with demonstrated costs at roughly $600/ tCO2. 5,8,9 To achieve the required scale outlined in the National Academies report, DAC plants must be deployed in the near-term as the deployment of more plants could lead to learning by doing and subsequent cost reductions. To achieve the removal targets of GtCO2 per year by midcentury would require an annual growth of 45% that is maintained over the next 30 years. Within the framework of energy-technology deployment, scale-up typically takes place at a rate of 1 order of magnitude per decade, which corresponds to a 26% annual growth rate. For illustration, the growth and experience rates of industries such as photovoltaics (PV) can be examined as a model for achieving the type of cost reductions and deployment scaling required for DAC to make meaningful contributions to climate change (see the Supporting Information, Experience Curves). Using the accelerated growth rates seen with PV (70% from 2000 to 2010 and 60% from 2010 to 2016), DAC would achieve a scale on the order of 80 MtCO2/year by 2050 with the ability to achieve GtCO2/yr scale by 2060. These growth models show optimistic potentials reaching 10s of MtCO2/year by mid-century and policy will be crucial to making larger facilities and standardized manufacturing financially viable. Although niche markets (such as aerospace and consumer products) allowed for the initial deployment of PV to 40 MW, policy incentives are one key reason why PV was able to scale so quickly. For example, a study carried out by Kavlak et al. indicated that government policies such as renewable portfolio standards, feed-in tariffs, and a variety of subsidies accounted for roughly 60% of the market growth of PV. These subsidies further allowed for continued and rapid technology innovation. As a given technology scales, there may be improvements that require redesign and system reoptimization. Currently, DAC is at the scale of thousands of tonnes of CO2 per year and further deployment at this scale will outline the research and development (R&D) needs required so that advanced and more cost-effective processes may be adopted. Recent federal policy developments have provided new financial drivers for scaling and optimizing DAC projects. The reformed 45Q tax credit within the 2018 Bipartisan Budget Act provides a tax credit of $15.29/tCO2 for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and utilization in 2018, increases linearly to $35t/CO2 in 2026, and rises with inflation thereafter. The Act limits qualified projects to those that have commenced construction prior to 2024, which could be extended in future budgets. Furthermore, DAC facilities must capture at least 100 ktCO2/yr and the credits can only be claimed for 12 years; however, there is no limit on the number of total or project bankable credits. This policy is designed to provide substantial interim incentives to increase both the efficiency and scale of DAC projects. Currently, the uncertainty of the extension of the 45Q tax credit for projects beyond 2024 makes the development of future projects economically ambiguous. Nonetheless, the transferability of the 45Q credit makes it possible for DAC companies and EOR or utilization operators to distribute credits and develop early partnerships, while scaling and improving their technologies. Until mass carbon markets can develop, DAC must be sustained by policy efforts as well as smaller, niche markets and customers. However, the best opportunities for DAC to begin commercializing today do not necessarily align with the ultimate markets for DAC as a negative emissions technology, that is, permanent storage. For one, it is important to find a robust paying customer, whether through existing markets for CO2 utilization and/or policy incentives for DAC. In many cases, these initial markets will not involve negative emissions, yet still provide value in facilitating the goal of technology cost reductions through initial deployments. However, through robust policy incentives, economic pathways for CO2 storage can be developed to achieve negative emissions. Although utilization or recycling of CO2 may seem like a distraction from the primary goal of the permanent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, 15 there are scenarios in which utilization could serve as a bridge toward DAC becoming a negative emission technology. For instance, lowering barriers of investment into the construction of DAC plants on pilotand demonstration-scales would lead not only to advanced designs but also to an increased demand in the sorbent material and equipment required. An increase in demand could stimulate competition in the field and advance R&D efforts, ultimately yielding reduced systems costs. The learning one acquires by building and operating DAC facilities under realistic conditions will ultimately provide greater clarit", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "8adc1aed2c1c24a72642e59d4fb258ce8db67a1e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "156099615", "DOI": "10.1007/978-90-481-8712-6_15", "CorpusId": 126566379}, "title": "Carbon Dioxide and Radioactive Waste in Central and Eastern Europe: A Regional Overview of Geological Storage and Disposal Potential", "abstract": "Given that carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage is a promising option for reducing greenhouse gas emission levels and that nuclear power-based energy production is a proven carbon-free technology, we give a regional overview of the geological storage potential of CO2 and disposal potential of radioactive waste in eight countries of Central and Eastern Europe (CEE): Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia (referred to here as the CEE-8).

The industry recognises that the Earth's carrying capacity is limited. It is adapting to seek to become a truly sustainable \u2018carbo\u2019-chemical industry. This paper will address the three main challenges of this transition: shifting hydrocarbon stock, climate change and circular economy. As the energy sector transitions from oil, coal and eventually natural gas, it is expected that the chemical industry will have access to abundant hydrocarbon stocks for which it can find valuable uses. But rising CO2 prices and increasing upgrading costs will likely encourage greater use of alternative, low-carbon feedstocks. In particular, there may be a development of biomass for manufacturing oxygenated chemical intermediates and bio-based materials. To help tackle climate change, the industry will need to reduce the CO2 emissions of its processes and utilities (energy sources). Ways to achieve this will include efficiency improvements, electrification of utilities and processes and switching to renewable H2; upgrading by-products to chemicals; and CO2 capture and storage or utilisation (CCS/CCU). The issue of plastic waste pollution is combining with the challenges discussed above to push society and governments towards a more circular economy. Customer demand for sustainable products is growing. New regulations (and technologies) are being rolled out for waste collection, sorting and recycling. In addition, the industry is making pledges to produce and use more sustainably. However, it is expected that fresh carbon will still have to enter the material cycle. It will be needed to feed the growth of the chemical industry and to compensate for inevitable recycling losses.

Cut my pie into four pieces, I don\u2019t think I could eat eight. \u2014Yogi Berra Estimating the practical limits to how much bioenergy could be produced in the future has been an academic sport in recent years, but is not a useful activity. Because biological photosynthesis usually results in less than 1% of available light energy being stored in biomass, there are easily calculated limits to the contribution that biological systems can make to human needs for energy. Recognition of this limitation provokes some authors to dismissive attitudes about bioenergy in favor of alternative technologies such as solar (Michel, 2012). However, biobased energy contributes approximately 10% of all human energy use at present (IEA, 2012), about 4.3 times as much as all hydro, and 11.4 times as much as all other renewables (e.g., solar, wind, and geothermal) combined. Thus, bioenergy is an important component of our overall energy system, and could be much larger without invoking dramatic changes in land use. For example, about 56% of the 1.2 billion tons of municipal solid waste in California is lignocellulose, which could be captured and converted to energy (Youngs and Somerville, Slade and colleagues (2014) recently reviewed the results of more than 120 estimates of the future contribution of bioenergy to the global energy use of about 550 EJ/year. The estimates vary widely, depending on the assumptions made, most of which reportedly had an optimistic bias. The estimates ranged from 22 to 1,272 EJ for energy crops, 10 to 66 EJ for agricultural residues, 12 to 120 EJ for wastes, and 60 to 230 EJ for forestry. Slade et al., concluded that nothing useful could be accomplished by further modeling studies or speculation about the magnitude of future bioenergy production and that the path forward is to learn by doing. Even at the pessimistic end of the estimates, bioenergy could contribute at least another 20% of total energy use. One of the drivers for the recent discourse about the potential contributions of different sources of energy appears to be the widespread recognition in the scienti\ufb01c community that carbon loading of the atmosphere may have undesirable Correspondence to: C.

Organizations that have grap- pled with how we might reduce the use of fossil fuels inevitably come to the recognition that, pending a break- through in fusion research, there is no straightforward path to the eventual displacement of fossil fuels (NAS, 2009). As participants in several of the large multidisciplinary analyses of our energy future, we have come to the opinion that relatively few people understand the whole picture. There is a natural tendency for colleagues working in one \ufb01eld or another to think that their favorite technology is important and very promising, and that if there were just more research and development dollars in their \ufb01eld things would be progressing much better. There are also a lot of people who do not welcome change in the energy sector because it is disruptive to their interests. Finally, many people are concerned about the ways in which we use land and water and are concerned about possible negative effects of energy technologies that impact these fundamental resources. Thus, consensus about the future of energy in general, and bioenergy in particular, is elusive for many reasons. It is clear that we will need a wide variety of solutions to meet our growing energy appetites sustainably. It is also clear that bioenergy has a place at the table. Several recent studies centered on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, using different approaches, have reached the conclusion that deploying all known low carbon technologies, including nuclear energy and carbon capture and storage (CCS), may be needed (Greenblatt et al., 2011; IPCC, 2014; Kainuma et al., 2013; McCollum et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2012). For example, even with other optimistic assumptions, such as electri\ufb01cation of all rail transport and a large percentage of the light duty \ufb02eet, heroic ef\ufb01ciency improvements and renewable electricity from wind, solar and geothermal, biofuels are the only available option foreseeable at large scale in the next 40 years for reducing emissions from the heavy duty \ufb02eet and aviation (Greenblatt et al., 2011; McCollum et al., 2012). Perhaps most controversially, biomass, when combined with CCS, is one of the few carbon negative options (IPCC, 2014; Keith, 2001). In other words, all the wedges are important (Pacala and Socolow, 2004), regardless of exactly how big they are. In some ways, it is challenging to consider quantitative estimates of probable future contributions of different energy technologies as a worthwhile scienti\ufb01c activity.
