After capture the CO 2 is compressed and transported to a reservoir where it is stored for geological time scales. Potential leakages from CCS projects, where stored CO 2 migrates through the overlaying sediments, are likely to have severe implications on benthic and marine ecosystems. Nonetheless, prokaryotic response to elevated CO 2 concentrations has been suggested as one of the first detectable warnings if a CO 2 leakage should occur. Applying properties of prokaryotic communities (i.e. community composition and metabolic status) as a novel CO 2 monitoring application is highly reliable within a multidisciplinary framework, where deviations from the baseline can easily be identified. In this paper we review current knowledge about the impact of CO 2 leakages on marine sediments from a multidisciplinary-based monitoring perspective. We focus on aspects from the fields of biology, geophysics, and chemistry, and discuss a case study example. We argue the importance of an integrative multidisciplinary approach, incorporating biogeochemistry, geophysics, microbial ecology and modelling, with a particular emphasis on metagenomic techniques and novel bioinformatics, for future CCS monitoring.

On the one hand, the low carbon society is demanding alternatives to traditional non-renewable pathways but on the other hand, investment in infrastructure demands certainty, scale, security, return on investment, and economic growth. What does the new infrastructure look like? Does it need to become more local or regional? How do current actors including utility companies, infrastructure providers, network operators, the government, and so on, need to change to put a focus on meeting utility service demand (rather than measuring the quantity of utility product delivered) within the age of the digital economy, smart technology autonomy and human-technology interaction? How do consumer behavior, automated demand response, and other socio-technical dependencies influence the effectiveness of this approach?We propose it is necessary to move beyond considering each utility as a distinct silo providing a single utility product. This siloed approach has created a utility product centric industry in which thesupply of infrastructure (roads, water mains, sewers, telecommunications networks, transmission lines, etc.) and products (gas, electricity, potable water, etc.) is paramount, and ignores the patterns of demand for the services (mobility, flexible working, ambient cooling, hygiene, etc.). This product supply focus acts to create lock-in to existing regimes which are still largely fossil-fuel dependent. This siloed approach persists despite the complex infrastructure system-of-systems exhibiting high levels of inter-dependency and feedback, and where overlapping vulnerabilities, investment and operational challenges, are poorly understood.Furthermore technological innovation, in devices using both non-renewable sources (such as photovoltaics) and renewable sources of energy (such as carbon capture storage), is creating competition and lack of clarity as to which infrastructure investment to make. A broad palette of technologies is emerging particularly to address the variability of renewable energy supply. Otherwise, globalization has been the driving force of the digital economy creating opportunities via the open internet for small to medium scale businesses to trade with very low overheads. These businesses are able to meet (and reduce) local demand for utility products through the provision of smart devices, and services to improve the efficiency of local equipment and goods such as boilers, insulation and double glazing. However uncertainties concerning business models for more intense and macro utility service provision together with risks in areas of regulation, contracting, security, ownership, and so on, are preventing larger scale roll-out. Barriers need to be liberated to allow service innovation to emerge, but this is not without the need for investment in increasing skills and accreditation to ensure safe and secure supply of integrated utility services.These multiple challenges arise at a time when the UK population is growing and there appears no stopping the positive feedback in demand for more utility services arising from improved wealth, greater knowledge and inter-connectivity through social networks, increased mobility, and so on. Meanwhile, in response to the predictions of climate change models the Kyoto agreement imposes very strong reductions in carbon emissions for the nations of the world. In particular the UK is signed up to reduce carbon emissions to 20% of their 1990 value by 2050. At the same time there is a need to increase water efficiency and water savings in the upcoming decades.

Not only is it critical to capture energy from new, renewable sources, it is also necessary to store the captured energy efficiently and effectively for use at the point of service when and where it is needed, which may not be collocated with the collection site. There are many potential storage media but we focus on the storage of energy in chemical bonds. It is more efficient to store energy on a per weight basis in chemical bonds. This is because it is hard to pack electrons into small volumes with low weight without the use of chemical bonds. The focus of the project was the development of new chemistries to enable DOE to meet its technical objectives for hydrogen storage using chemical hydrogen storage systems. We provided computational chemistry support in terms of thermodynamics, kinetics, and properties prediction in support of the experimental efforts of the DOE Center of Excellence for Chemical Hydrogen Storage. The goal of the Center is to store energy in chemical bonds involving hydrogen atoms. Once themore\u00a0\u00bb hydrogen is stored in a set of X-H/Y-H bonds, the hydrogen has to be easily released and the depleted fuel regenerated very efficiently. This differs substantially from our current use of fossil fuel energy sources where the reactant is converted to energy plus CO2 (coal) or CO2 and H2O (gasoline, natural gas), which are released into the atmosphere. In future energy storage scenarios, the spent fuel will be captured and the energy storage medium regenerated. This places substantial additional constraints on the chemistry. The goal of the computational chemistry work was to reduce the time to design new materials and develop materials that meet the 2010 and 2015 DOE objectives in terms of weight percent, volume, release time, and regeneration ability. This goal was met in terms of reducing the number of costly experiments and helping to focus the experimental effort on the potentially optimal targets. We have used computational chemistry approaches to predict the thermodynamic properties of a wide range of compounds containing boron, nitrogen, hydrogen, and other elements as appropriate including carbon. These calculations were done in most cases with high level molecular orbital theory methods that have small error bars on the order of \u00b1 1 to 2 kcal/mol. The results were used to benchmark more approximate methods such as density functional theory for larger systems and for database development. We predicted reliable thermodynamics for thousands of compounds for release and regeneration schemes to aid/guide materials design and process design and simulation. These are the first reliable computed values for these compounds and for many represent the only available values. Overall, the computational results have provided us with new insights into the chemistry of main group and organic-base chemical hydrogen systems from the release of hydrogen to the regeneration of spent fuel. A number of experimental accomplishments were also made in this project. The experimental work on hydrogen storage materials centered on activated polarized \u03c3- or \u03c0-bonded frameworks that hold the potential for ready dihydrogen activation, uptake, and eventually release. To this end, a large number of non-traditional valence systems including carbenes, cyanocarbons, and C-B and and B-N systems were synthesized and examined. During the course of these studies an important lead arose from the novel valency of a class of stable organic singlet bi-radical systems. A synthetic strategy to an \u201cendless\u201d hydrogen storage polymer has been developed based on our cyanocarbon chemistry. A key issue with the synthetic efforts was being able to link the kinetics of release with the size of the substituents as it was difficult to develop a low molecular weight molecule with the right kinetics. A novel hydrogen activation process has been developed which showed that Lewis acid-base pairs need not be \u201cfrustrated\u201d in their reactivity towards activating H2. Reaction can occur at temperatures as low as -80 oC. We established that the interaction of H2 with the electrophile is a key step in the activation process.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "4dde80f69a1cedebaba1fff77f52321054ea61c7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3044767946", "CorpusId": 227685172}, "title": "Making a Difference with Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (Carney)", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "2ccb1cdcf781876ff59c0e0edd6fdf1ccdf41d21", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.1c03478", "CorpusId": 245879140, "PubMed": "35015535"}, "title": "Technoeconomic Analysis of Negative Emissions Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage through Pyrolysis and Bioenergy District Heating Infrastructure.", "abstract": "Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) has been identified as a cost-effective negative emission technology that will be necessary to limit global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C targets.

The proposed PtG solution takes advantage of the synergies of different processes to integrate energy storage efficiently with carbon utilization to produce a \u2018CO2 neutral\u2019 natural gas. PtG converts surplus electricity into synthetic natural gas by combining H2 from water electrolysis and CO2 through methanation reaction and oxyfuel combustion. This carbon capture option releases thermal energy from the synthetic fuel producing a near-pure stream of CO2 that close the carbon loop used for methanation. Under this framework, the present work proposes to study and validate the hybridization between Power-to-Gas energy storage technology and CO2 oxyfuel combustion in the residential sector. This combination is a novel strategy focused on solving: (i) the intermittent and seasonal electricity generation from renewable resources; (ii) the large energy and economic penalties associated with CO2 capture and utilization (especially at small scale); (iii) and the development of energy storage systems of small-medium size and high flexibility. \n \nThis hybridization allows managing the excess of renewable electricity in the Power-to-Gas installation and producing hydrogen (stored energy) and oxygen (by-product). Subsequently, oxygen is used to meet the needs of the oxyfuel combustion process, in this case, in the residential sector, with two important advantages: a high concentration CO2 flow is obtained, and the oxygen production neither requires an air separation unit (ASU) nor additional energy requirements. The stored hydrogen and the captured carbon dioxide are combined by methanation to produce synthetic natural gas stored for future uses. From CO2 capture point of view, the proposed hybrid system presents an additional advantage: there would also be no penalty associated with the compression and underground storage of captured CO2, since it is reused in the oxyfuel burner along with the oxygen, obtained in the electrolyzer, closing the carbon cycle. A PtG installation with recycled CO2 utilization has been designed to fully supply the thermal heating demand and partially the electrical demand of a single-family house located in the northeast of Germany, from a photovoltaic generator. The PtG system's characteristics, the CO2 storage and utilization strategy, the equipment necessary and energy balances are presented and illustrated with a case study. The proposed design can supply the 87% of the energy consumed by a single-family home and avoid the emissions of 2.8 tons of CO2 every year.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "ad0764d27c56e734ae8fb4b16135c8adaebf1303", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1642856435", "CorpusId": 109734979}, "title": "Acceptance by proxy : analyzing perceptions of hydraulic fracturing to better understand public acceptance for geologic storage of carbon dioxide", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) represents an important pathway for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in order to mitigate climate change. However, there is significant uncertainty about how the technology will be accepted by the public, which is difficult to predict for relatively unknown technologies such as CCS. As such, this thesis explores the use of a similar but betterknown technology\u2014hydraulic fracturing\u2014as an analogue for learning lessons about public acceptance of the geologic storage component of CCS. The thesis asks two questions: (1) What factors are associated with public acceptance of geologic storage? And (2) What actions should communities, regulators, and stakeholders take to ensure the safe and efficient deployment of CCS technology? The thesis investigates these questions using three separate but related analyses. A series of regressions explores links between states' history of fossil fuel extraction and current regulatory attitudes toward hydraulic fracturing. A comparative case study characterizes trends in the development of laws and regulations related to hydraulic fracturing in three states: Pennsylvania, New York State, and Colorado. Finally, a survey identifies factors associated with positive and negative public perceptions of both hydraulic fracturing and CCS. The survey includes an experimental question that measures the extent to which compensation can be used to improve public acceptance for facility siting. Through these analyses, the thesis reaches several conclusions. States with an extensive history of fossil fuel extraction are more likely to regulate hydraulic fracturing with a moderate level of regulatory stringency, and similar tendencies toward CCS are likely. Municipalities are playing an increasingly significant role in the regulation of hydraulic fracturing, and are likely to be important stakeholders for CCS projects as well. A number of demographic and worldview factors are associated with public acceptance, but none were found to have substantial predictive power. However, the amount of compensation offered to nearby residents was found to have a moderate effect on public acceptance. Developers should therefore consider compensation a tool for increasing the likelihood of acceptance among residents nearby a potential project site. Policymakers should in turn institute market incentives such as robust carbon prices to foster a financial environment that encourages developers to engage with municipalities and residents.

Renewable energy capacity is required to reach this ambition, together with transmission and storage capacity to maintain grid stability. Carbon capture and storage could potentially decrease the required renewable energy capacity, while simultaneously increasing grid flexibility. This research focuses on finding a cost-optimal composition of technologies, while abiding by the goals set in the Paris climate treaty. To investigate this objective, two optimisation models are compared: a linear programmed optimisation model with a high temporal and low technical resolution, and a unit commitment model with a low temporal but high technical resolution. Fixed costs and installed capacities are determined by the linear model. Subsequently, both models calculate the optimal generation mix. Three scenarios for 2050 were evaluated: a 'business as usual' reference scenario with maximum emission comparable to 2014 levels, a scenario with a maximum emission consistent with a 96% reduction in 2050 compared to 2014 and a scenario with that same target and the possibility to implement carbon capture and storage. The results show that the goals set by the Paris agreement increase system costs of the European power sector, but the increase is moderated by deployment of carbon capture and storage. Compared to the linear model, unit commitment increases variable costs, but this increase is modest, serving as confirmation that a linear modelling approach can be sufficient for answering a wide range of questions. To increase accuracy, one might integrate both models and provide a complete answer that integrates long time-spans and a wide variety of technical constraints.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "47e73a8c3f1793d198f2d8eb74eb469f061449d6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2955909042", "DOI": "10.1081/E-ESS-120044975", "CorpusId": 198806987}, "title": "Capture of CO2 from Power Plants", "abstract": "An option that has been proposed to combat the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere is the capture of CO2 at a power plant and injection of the CO2 into a geologic formation for permanent storage, a process generally referred to as carbon capture and storage.

They are used in many applications ranging from the touch screen in our smartphones to more critical contexts such as pollution monitoring. Although sensors have been developed for a long time, the demands are continuously increasing and many sensors still suffer from insufficient selectivity and/or sensitivity. The development of nanosensors has been suggested as one solution to push sensor performance boundaries further by exploiting the unique phenomena occurring at the nanoscale. One of the nanotechnology subareas of particular interest for sensing applications is nanoplasmonics, which explores the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) phenomenon occurring in metal nanoparticles. \nIn this thesis, nanoplasmonic sensing is developed and utilized in the context of the current challenges in the energy and environmental fields, or more specifically, the hydrogen economy, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and solar energy harvesting technologies. \nIn the first part, direct nanoplasmonic sensing based on AuPd alloy nanoparticles is explored for use as next-generation hydrogen sensors. To facilitate the nanofabrication of such alloy nanostructures, a bottom-up nanofabrication strategy for producing supported alloy nanoparticles with excellent control of their composition is developed. The performance of the fabricated AuPd alloy hydrogen sensors is then assessed and favorably compared to the performance targets set for hydrogen sensors to be used in fuel cell vehicles. \nIn the second part, indirect nanoplasmonic sensing is established as an analytical tool to assess key properties of energy related materials for CCS and organic photovoltaics. The first study constitutes an investigation of CO2 adsorption in a microporous polymer, and the optical determination of the CO2 isosteric heat of adsorption. The second study addresses the thickness dependence of the glass transition temperature of a polymer:fullerene blend used as light absorber layer in organic photovoltaic devices.

In CGS, CO2 is captured from large point-source emitters (e.g., coal fired power stations), purified, and injected deep underground into geological formations for disposal. However, the CO2 has a lower density than the resident formation brine and thus migrates upward due to buoyancy forces. To prevent the CO2 from leaking back to the surface, four trapping mechanisms are used: (1) structural trapping (where a tight caprock acts as a seal barrier through which the CO2 cannot percolate), (2) residual trapping (where the CO2 plume is split into many micrometer-sized bubbles, which are immobilized by capillary forces in the pore network of the rock), (3) dissolution trapping (where CO2 dissolves in the formation brine and sinks deep into the reservoir due to a slight increase in brine density), and (4) mineral trapping (where the CO2 introduced into the subsurface chemically reacts with the formation brine or reservoir rock or both to form solid precipitates). The efficiency of these trapping mechanisms and the movement of CO2 through the rock are strongly influenced by the CO2\u2212 brine\u2212rock wettability (mainly due to the small capillary-like pores in the rock which form a complex network), and it is thus of key importance to rigorously understand CO2-wettability. In this context, a substantial number of experiments have been conducted from which several conclusions can be drawn: of prime importance is the rock surface chemistry, and hydrophilic surfaces are water-wet while hydrophobic surfaces are CO2-wet. Note that CO2-wet surfaces dramatically reduce CO2 storage capacities. Furthermore, increasing pressure, salinity, or dissolved ion valency increases CO2-wettability, while the effect of temperature is not well understood. Indeed theoretical understanding of CO2-wettability and the ability to quantitatively predict it are currently limited although recent advances have been made. Moreover, data for real storage rock and real injection gas (which contains impurities) is scarce and it is an open question how realistic subsurface conditions can be reproduced in laboratory experiments. In conclusion, however, it is clear that in principal CO2-wettability can vary drastically from completely water-wet to almost completely CO2wet, and this possible variation introduces a large uncertainty into trapping capacity and containment security predictions.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "038546ab2b86d3ab00e07c73632d15ff23a0ce15", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2945086857", "CorpusId": 181645806}, "title": "Making a Difference with Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (Azzolina)", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "2957bc4c305676498d13481ada277cd771d8f4a6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2340619768", "CorpusId": 4985385}, "title": "An odor odyssey: review of scientific progress toward eliminating odorant emissions from Philadelphia\u00c6s biosolids", "abstract": "The Philadelphia Water Department (PWD) has for six-years intensively studied the odor characteristics of its biosolids cake to identify effective mitigative measures for odor control.

A peak odorant intensity results several days after dewatering. Concentrations of TVOSCs may at times be six orders of magnitude above the ED50 concentration. No single mitigative measure provides compelling control over odorant production.

In CCS schemes, CO2 is captured from large scale industrial emitters and transported to geological sites, such as depleted oil or gas fields or saline aquifers, where it is injected into the rock formation for storage. Pipelines are acknowledged as one of the safest, most efficient and cost-effective methods for transporting large volumes of fluid over long distances and therefore most of the proposed schemes for CCS involve onshore and/or offshore high pressure pipelines transporting CO2.In order to manage the risk in the unlikely event of the failure of a CO2 pipeline, it is necessary to define the separation distance between pipelines and habitable dwellings in order to ensure a consistent level of safety. For natural gas pipelines, existing and accepted QRA (Quantitative Risk Assessment) techniques can be implemented to define safety zones based on thermal hazards. However for high pressure CO2 pipelines, for which the hazard is toxic, the consequences of failure need to be considered differently, which will impact on the QRA assessment and the definition of safety distances.The requirement to develop a robust QRA methodology for high pressure CO2 pipelines has been recognised by National Grid as being critical to the implementation of CCS. Consequently, as part of the COOLTRANS (CO2 Liquid pipeline TRANSportation) research programme, failure frequency and consequence models are being developed that are appropriate for high pressure CO2 pipelines. One of the key components in the consequence modelling of a release from a CO2 pipeline is an infiltration model for CO2 into buildings to describe the impact on people inside buildings, and outside seeking shelter, during a release event.This paper describes the development of an infiltration model to predict how the concentration of CO2 within a building will change based on both wind driven and buoyancy driven ventilation of an external CO2 cloud into the building. The model considers the effects of either a constant or changing external concentration of CO2 during a release and allows the density effects of the dense cloud to be taken into account to enable the toxic effects on people within the building to be predicted. The paper then demonstrates how the ventilation model can be coupled to the results of a dispersion analysis from a pipeline release under different environmental conditions to develop the consequence data required for input into the QRA. These effects are illustrated through a case study example.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "57ea707f72c7c1e1fccd24d3c5e3e16cdb138673", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2294018947", "CorpusId": 130614133}, "title": "Impact of subsurface fluid flow on sediment acoustic properties, implications for carbon capture and storage", "abstract": "Geological Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a promising climate change mitigation technology, which allows the reduction of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions into the atmosphere. Although CCS is considered to have a significant potential in tackling climate change, several uncertainties remain, including the efficiency and permanency of carbon sequestration, and notably risks of CO2 leakage from the storage reservoir. A better understanding of fluid flow activity within the sedimentary overburden and the identification of the best monitoring techniques are crucial for increasing societal confidence in sequestration. This thesis reports findings from two different offshore CCS projects: a controlled sub-seabed CO2 release experiment completed in Ardmucknish Bay, Oban (Quantifying and Monitoring Potential Ecosystem Impacts of Geological Carbon Storage, QICS), and a multidisciplinary research project conducted in the vicinity of Sleipner CCS site, in the Central North Sea (Sub-seabed CO2 Storage: Impact on Marine Ecosytems, ECO2). During the QICS project, a borehole was drilled from land, allowing 37 days of CO2 release in unconsolidated marine sediments. Analysis of the time-lapse high- resolution seismic reflection data reveals development of acoustic anomalies within the overburden and water column, caused by CO2 fluxing in the vicinity of the injection site. The impacts of CO2 injection on sediment acoustic properties are investigated, where changes in seismic reflectivity, seismic attenuation, acoustic impedance and P-wave seismic velocity are detected on high-resolution seismic reflection data. CO2 migration within the overburden is interpreted to be controlled by sediment stratigraphy and injection rate/total injected volume throughout the gas release, and by the sediment stratigraphic geometry post-release. Seismic quantification of the gaseous CO2 indicates that most of the injected CO2 is trapped below a stratigraphic boundary, located at 4 m depth below the seafloor, or dissolved, throughout the gas release. These observations are in agreement with seabed gas flux measurements by passive hydroacoustics and water column bubble sampling, which suggest that only 15% of the injected CO2 emerges at the seabed, towards the end of gas release. Within the scope of the ECO2 project, increased fluid flow activity is detected along, and in the vicinity of a seabed fracture, the Hugin Fracture. Although there is no evidence of anthropogenic CO2 leakage in the Central North Sea from the current dataset, biogenic and thermogenic gas leakage at the Hugin Fracture suggest a well-established hydraulic and structural connection. The origin of the Hugin Fracture is proposed to be controlled by an E-W transtensional stress regime, and differential compaction above a buried tunnel valley system.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "aeb41ef9008b22bcfe49bbd80754e4bf9ae39200", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2592491616", "CorpusId": 131855615}, "title": "Passive Tomography to Image Stress Redistribution Prior to Failure on Berea Sandstone and Marcellus Shale for Caprock Integrity", "abstract": "A recent concern is the cause and effect of global climate change. Many institutions give credit for these changes to the increased levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, in particular the increase in the amount of carbon dioxide present. There is a growing interest in carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a means to reduce the global impact of CO2 on the climate as a greenhouse gas. Carbon capture is the process of removing CO2 from the atmosphere as well as preventing it from entering the atmosphere by means of exhaust. The captured carbon is stored underground in reservoirs. These reservoirs have the storage space to handle the volume of CO2 injected as well as a caprock layer preventing the injection fluid from returning to the surface. Additionally, CO2 can be used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). To monitor the injection sites used for the CO2 storage or EOR process, the integrity of the caprock as well as the surrounding rock formations are the locations of interest.

The two models used are techno-economical energy system models including an extensive description of technologies on energy production and consumption. The models derive the sectoral energy demand from given economic projections and calculate the optimal way of satisfying the energy demand through market equilibrium. The basis for EU wide calculations was the Common POLES-IMAGE economic scenarios which project a GDP growth of 2.4 % p.a. until 2020. A sensitivity analysis was conducted with a lower economic growth projection. The results indicated that a reduction of 20 % compared to 1990 emission levels by 2020 would lead to most reductions being conducted at the electricity sector. The consumption of coal in electricity generation would decrease considerably. In the long term some of the natural gas based production would incorporate carbon capture and storage (CCS), and the use of wind power would grow substantially. The value of carbon would lie at levels around 20 to 30 \u0080/t CO2 by 2020 were the reductions carried out without flexibility mechanisms. With a reduction target of -30 % by 2050, the value of carbon would rise to 40 \u0096 50 \u0080/t CO2 by 2050, and nearly to 100 \u0080/t CO2 with a target of -60 % in 2050. The calculations on Finland were based on economic projections by the Ministry of Finance and the Government Institute of Economic Research. The scenarios asses the optimal way of reducing Finnish emissions with a range of prices for emission rights between 20 and 50 \u0080/t CO2. The sectors not included in the emission trading scheme were assumed to conduct reductions with costs up to the value of emission rights. The use of coal was reduced after 2010, accompanied by an increase in the use of natural gas. The utilization of bioenergy increases considerable in the total energy balances. Also the use of wind power would grow. CCS would be profitable after 2020 with the higher prices for emission rights. The relative differences in sectoral emission are highest in electricity production. Were the Finnish reduction target at -20 % in 2020, Finland would buy emission rights with all price levels. A target of -10 % would result with selling of rights on higher price levels at later stages.

With the aid of CCS (carbon capture and storage) technology greenhouse gas emissions can be clearly reduced. On the other hand plant operators and politics are facing special challenges in connection with the technical, economical and legal implementation of CCS plants. Independent assistance to CCS projects with integrated system analyses is increasing in importance. Even today, owners/operators of fossil-fuel power stations must already ensure that the design of their plants permits the fitting of suitable CCS (carbon capture & storage) technology. The backdrop to this regulation is that the European Union has set itself a reduction target for EU-wide greenhouse gas emissions of at least 20 % by 2020 and even up to 80 % by 2050 compared to the baseline year of 1990. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, on the one hand, offers the potential of a clear cut in direct greenhouse gases. On the other hand, however, it presents plant owners/operators and political bodies with special challenges in ensuring its technologically safe, cost-effective and legally-compliant implementation. Impartial support for CCS projects and assistance in the form of integrated system analysis will become more important. In addition to the possible technical processes for CO 2 capture, this article deals with the \"Fit for Carbon Capture\" certification as well as the configuration of CO 2 transportation systems. With the certification, a specific guideline has been developed that assesses the possibility of power plants to integrate suitable CCS technology, and serves as the basis for the approval process. Because the storage reservoirs are rarely located near the power generation site, a suitable CO 2 transport system is needed. New transport systems such as pipelines need to be built, since liquefied CO 2 under high pressure requires special pipe sizes and wall thicknesses.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "6976f6e8d20a286cedee7d14a7636743bfea91e3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2035293634", "DOI": "10.1590/S0103-65132014005000008", "CorpusId": 153825554}, "title": "Incentivos econ\u00f4micos e projeto de supply chain para captura e sequestro de carbono: caso Brasil", "abstract": "In this study, we analyze a strategy to reduce carbon emissions that combines the creation of an economic incentive policy and the deployment of a network infrastructure for carbon capture and storage (CCS).

A component of the geophysical monitoring program at Weyburn has included the use of downhole geophones to monitor microseismic activity. Microseismic events have already been used to assess the likelihood of CO2 leakage through the caprock at Weyburn. However, in recent years, the focus with respect to CCS and geomechanics has shifted to the concern that fluid injection will trigger induced seismicity. Therefore, in this paper we reanalyse the microseismic observations at Weyburn with respect to concerns regarding induced seismicity. We assess the population statistics of the Weyburn microseismic events, both in terms of the Gutenberg\u2013Richter b-values and the correlation between moment release and injection/production volumes. Our observations serve to corroborate previous studies that considered the geomechanical cause of the microseismic events: namely that the events are not directly triggered by fluid injection, but in response to stress transfer through the rock frame in response to both production and injection. We observe that the bvalue at Weyburn is close to 1, the value expected for stress-driven, tectonic seismicity, and significantly lower than values observed in cases where the microseismicity is directly driven by fluid injection (during hydraulic fracturing, for example). We also note little to no correlation between fluid volume changes and induced seismicity \u2013 either injection volume alone or net volume change (produced\u2013injected). Finally, we use the observed event statistics to forecast the likelihood that current operations at Weyburn will lead to larger events of sufficient magnitude to be of concern to local populations. We find that the probability of inducing such events is very unlikely. \u00a9 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The CCS realisation is interconnected to investments into other technologies, to technological advances, to the price of CO2 emission certificates, to plant dispatch, and to the prices of power. In a system of CCS potential realisation by individual actors, these variables are endogenous. This article is mainly about them.CCS is more of a long term option than a bridge technology. In contrast to other CO2 reduction technologies, both economic operation and economic investment necessarily require high CO2 certificate prices.An increase in power plant efficiency without CCS, switching to natural gas and power generation from renewable sources involve more mature technologies that may benefit from further application within the coming decades. Even far beyond 2020 this effect may delay and dampen the potential of CCS technology.An economic or market potential is dependent to a lesser extent on assumptions about future barriers but rather on their dynamic interactions.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "13d58a6007f3485a224035d72641f07220a125e0", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 14465365}, "title": "Patterns of rhizosphere carbon flux in sugar maple ( Acer saccharum ) and yellow birch ( Betula allegheniensis ) saplings", "abstract": "Despite its importance in the terrestrial C cycle rhizosphere carbon flux (RCF) has rarely been measured for intact root\u2013soil systems.

We observed appearance of the label in rhizosphere soil of both species within the first 24 h, and a striking difference between species in the timing of C release to soil. In sugar maple, peak concentration of the label appeared 1 day after labeling and declined over time whereas in birch the label increased in concentration over the 7-day chase period. The sum of root and rhizomicrobial respiration in the pots was 19% and 26% of total soil respiration in sugar maple and yellow birch, respectively.

In particular policy makers now increasingly consider targeted land use change such as afforestation and biomass plantations as options to extract carbon from the atmosphere. In light of this, it is important to understand sustainability limits and implications of tCDR in the context of Earth system dynamics. This thesis provides a model based assessment of biogeochemical and hydrological sideeffects of large-scale biomass plantations and afforestation in the context of planetary boundaries, delimiting a safe operating space for humanity. Simulations with a dynamic global vegetation model (LPJmL) indicate considerable biogeochemical and hydrological consequences of biomass plantations which are even larger than those of historical agricultural land use. In particular, biomass plantations on current agricultural land use areas show a 22% increase in net primary productivity compared to natural vegetation on the same area, which drives other alterations in regional and global carbon and water cycles. Additionally, land use scenarios of biomass plantations are developed with a multi-objective optimisation model under consideration of regional environmental constraints and evaluated against the global planetary boundaries for biogeochemical flows, biosphere integrity, land system change and freshwater use. This shows clear trade-offs between planetary boundaries and tCDR. Respecting environmental constraints according to the planetary boundary framework yields almost zero tCDR potential. The transgression of regional environmental constraints into a zone of increasing risk of triggering feedbacks at the planetary scale can provide considerable annual net carbon extraction rates of 1.4 GtC 6.9 GtC, depending on the biomass conversion pathway and the timely operationalisation of large-scale carbon capture and storage plants. The importance of co-evolutionary dynamics of the Earth\u2019s carbon cycle and societal interventions through tCDR is demonstrated with a conceptual modelling approach in the context of carbon-related planetary boundaries. It becomes apparent that focussing on climate change without an integrated trade-offs assessments may lead to navigating the Earth system out of the safe operating space due to collateral transgression of other boundaries. The success of tCDR depends on the degree of anticipation of climate change, the potential tCDR rate and the underlying emission pathway.

Efficient mitigation strategies combined with advanced carbon capture technologies are required to address this global threat. Direct air capture (DAC) offers an attractive proposition that would facilitate onsite technologies that use CO2 as a feedstock, eliminating the need for storage and transportation. Currently, CO2 scrubbers based on aqueous alkanolamine solutions and amine grafted mesoporous materials are being used for DAC, but they suffer from high regeneration energy. CO2 selective physisorbents have the potential to reduce energy costs of DAC but have until recently not exhibited appropriate selectivity and hydrolytic stability. Crystal engineering, defined as \u201cthe field of chemistry that studies the design, properties and application of crystals\u201d has recently enabled the design of a new generation of physisorbents with the pore size and pore chemistry suited for DAC. Specifically, hybrid ultramicroporous materials (HUMs) with inorganic anion pillars that offer strong electrostatics and tight binding sites for CO2 can offer precise control over pore size/chemistry to afford order of magnitude improvement in the carbon capture performance of physisorbents. A pyrazine based HUM, (Zn(pyrazine)2SiF6)n, SIFSIX-3-Zn, reported in 2013 was found to exhibit a new benchmark for CO2/N2 selectivity (> 1800). The primary objective of this study is to prepare and characterise a platform of related HUMs by systematically varying the metal node or the inorganic pillar in order to develop HUMs with the following characteristics: a) high thermal and hydrolytic stability, b) better DAC performance and c) cost-effective synthesis (high yield/low waste). A secondary objective is to gain insight into the reasons for the exceptional carbon capture performance of HUMs. Chapter 1 reviews the deployment of state-of-the-art CO2 capture technologies in the context of addressing the global issue of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-regulation. It comprehensively reviews the present and emerging technologies available for trace capture of CO2, and its eventual role in mitigating atmospheric CO2 emissions. Prompted by diverse functionalities, CO2-selective sorption performance for literature-reported MOFs over other relevant competing gases have been discussed, prior to the evaluation of trace carbon capture capacity for a few. This follows an attempt to systematically decipher the crystal engineering principles aimed at the design of efficient CO2-sorbents. Discussion on importance of pore size and pore chemistry and their influence on selectivity for CO2 over other competing gases, thermal and hydrolytic stability, and high isosteric heat of adsorption (Qst) for CO2, relevant to DAC of CO2 concludes the chapter. Chapter 2 focuses on the assessment of DAC performance for CO2 by porous materials. In this regard, four different types of materials represented by prototypical compounds, an amine-grafted mesoporous silica (chemisorbent), a zeolite (inorganic physisorbent), HKUST-1 and Mg-MOF-74 (MOF physisorbents), and [Ni(pyrazine)2(SiF6)]n, SIFSIX-3-Ni, a Hybrid Ultramicroporous Material (HUM physisorbent) were studied for their DAC performance. Quantification of CO2 and other vapours (i.e. H2O) adsorbed by the sorbents under different atmospheric conditions relevant to DAC was obtained by Temperature-Programmed Desorption (TPD) combined with Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Mass Spectrometry (MS).All the sorbents were found to be capable of carbon capture from CO2-rich gas mixtures, but competition and reaction with atmospheric moisture significantly reduced their DAC performance. SIFSIX-3Ni, a HUM outperformed all the other physisorbents with a DAC capacity of 4.07 litres of CO2 per kilogram of material and was second only to amine-grafted mesoporous silica (a chemisorbent), in terms of its performance. However, lower regeneration temperature for SIFSIX-3-Ni relative to amine-grafted mesoporous silica makes it the preferred candidate for DAC of CO2. Stability of sorbents towards moisture, a critical parameter towards the assessment of DAC performance was also studied using the standard, industry-accepted accelerated aging protocol (45 \u00b0C and 75% relative humidity). Chapter 3 highlights the role of fine tuning the HUMs by varying the inorganic pillar to yield sorbents with enhanced stability and improved trace carbon capture performance. In this context, a new HUM [Ni(pyrazine)2(TiF6)]n, (TIFSIX-3-Ni), was obtained by the use of TiF62as the inorganic pillar instead of SiF62used in SIFSIX-3-Ni, and NbOF52used in [Ni(pyrazine)2(NbOF5)]n, NbOFFIVE-1-Ni. Sorption properties, DAC performance, thermal and hydrolytic stability of the three isostructural analogues were studied to understand the correlation between the choice of inorganic pillar and the resultant properties. TIFSIX-3-Ni and NbOFFIVE-1-Ni performed the best with benchmark DAC capacity of 9.09 and 9.42 litres of CO2 per kilogram of material respectively. This study indicates that increased electrostatics generated by highly polarized inorganic pillars such as TiF62and NbOF52in HUMs are most effective at improving Qst and overall CO2 adsorption performance of the sorbents. Chapter 4 elaborates the facile synthesis method to synthesize HUMs in gram-scale, by mechanochemistry. In this regard, a rapid, solvent free and energy economic method using dry solid grinding approach was developed to efficiently synthesize HUMs. Ten HUMs, six previously reported ([Zn(pyrazine)2(SiF6)]n, SIFSIX-3-Zn; [Co(pyrazine)2(SiF6)]n, SIFSIX3-Co; [Fe(pyrazine)2(SiF6)]n, SIFSIX-3-Fe; SIFSIX-3-Ni; TIFSIX-3-Ni and NbOFFIVE-1Ni) and four new HUMs ([Zn(pyrazine)2(TiF6)]n, TIFSIX-3-Zn; [Co(pyrazine)2(TiF6)]n, TIFSIX-3-Co; [Zn(pyrazine)2(NbOF5)]n, NbOFFIVE-1-Zn; and [Co(pyrazine)2(NbOF5)]n, NbOFFIVE-1-Co) were obtained using the mechanochemcial method. Sorption properties, thermal and hydrolytic stability of mechanochemically synthesized HUMs were compared to the ones obtained via conventional method, so as to verify their phase purity and confirm the structural integrity. Further carbon capture performance and physical stability of all the ten variants were systematically studied to understand the structure-property relationship in isostructural HUMs. Ni2+ variants performed the best in terms of CO2 uptake and also exhibited higher degree of stability which could be attributed to the stronger Ni-N bonds. Chapter 5 addresses the role of strong electrostatics offered by inorganic pillars and narrow pores in the context of DAC of CO2. The DAC performance of ten physisorbents, four HUMs, SIFSIX-3-Cu, DICRO-3-Ni-i, SIFSIX-2-Cu-i and MOOFOUR-1-Ni, five microporous MOMs, DMOF-1, ZIF-8, MIL-101, UiO-66 and UiO-66-NH2, and an ultramicroporous MOM, Ni-4-PyC, was investigated. The amounts of sorbates (CO2 and H2O) adsorbed by the physisorbents under different atmospheric conditions relevant to DAC was quantified by TPD coupled with TGA and MS. All the physisorbents exhibited high CO2 adsorption capacity and strong interaction with CO2 under dry conditions. However, under moist conditions, their CO2 capture performance significantly reduced owing to competition with water. Microporous and ultramicroporous MOMs devoid of inorganic pillars exhibited negligible CO2 uptake upon exposure to DAC conditions, emphasising the importance of strong electrostatics created by the presence of inorganic pillars. Furthermore, one observes significant reduction in CO2 sorption performance of interpenetrated HUMs, DICRO-3-Ni-i and SIFSIX-2-Cu-i, under DAC conditions. This highlights the fact that the mere presence of inorganic pillars does not facilitate enhanced CO2 sorption performance. The disposition of inorganic pillars lining the pore walls is equally crucial in terms of creation of strong electrostatics. Indeed, SIFSIX-3-Cu, that fulfils these two factors along with the presence of ultramicropores, exhibits high CO2 uptake (7.18 L/kg) under DAC conditions. While SIFSIX3-Cu lacks stability towards humidity precluding its practical utility, it provides valuable insights regarding improved design strategies for the development of advanced functional materials for DAC of CO2. Chapter 6 explains how modular nature and amenability to crystal engineering makes HUMs the only class of potential sorbents that can offer viable solutions for DAC of CO2. The findings detailed herein afford better understanding of structure-property relationship and how subtle changes in pore size and pore chemistry can enhance the carbon capture performance of sorbents even in the presence of moisture. Also, these studies leads to development of new design principles which can be used in the future to develop advanced sorbents with improved performance for myriad applications. With facile synthetic strategy in place, the chapter emphasises the need to further explore and develop HUMs in terms of higher technological readiness levels for the implementation of DAC of CO2 at industrial scale. Chapter 7 outlines some of the potential usage for captured CO2 and how DAC could enable the existing industrial processes using CO2 as feedstock. The chapter further discusses some of the potential applications of HUMs. It concludes by highlighting the yet unaccomplished objectives in context of HUMs and how their achievement would advance the field of research on HUMs to higher technological readiness levels.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "d3181a8c6be6989aa92bf49f41c5586256a5bea5", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.22617/tcs200427", "CorpusId": 240650783}, "title": "Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage Game Changers in Asia:", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "66a2ca95c11b2c50f9ae0561925af3a6d3167cec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1980395203", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.20148911", "CorpusId": 129366876}, "title": "Carbon Dioxide Storage in Reservoir Structures on Example of Jastrzabka Stara Oil Deposit", "abstract": "Carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases, which occur in the atmosphere as a result of Earths processes and human activity.

The heats of adsorption for H2 on MOF-177 were -11.3 to -5.8 kJ/mol. By adding a H2 dissociating catalyst and using our bridge building technique to build carbon bridges for hydrogen spillover, the hydrogen adsorption capacity in MOF-177 was enhanced by a factor of approximately 2.5, to 1.5 wt % at 298 K and 10 MPa, and the adsorption was reversible. N2 and O2 adsorption measurements showed that O2 was adsorbed more favorably than N2 on MOF-177 with a selectivity of approximately 1.8 at 1 atm and 298 K, which makes MOF-177 a promising candidate for air separation. The isotherm was linear for O2 while being concave for N2. Water vapor adsorption studies indicated that MOF-177 adsorbed up to approximately 10 wt % H2O at 298 K. The framework structure of MOF-177 was not stable upon H2O adsorption, which decomposed after exposure to ambient air in 3 days.

Alternatively, bio-sequestration of CO 2 using microalgal cell factories has emerged as a promising way of recycling CO 2 into biomass via photosynthesis. In the present study, Indigenous algal strain Pseudanabaena limnetica was cultivated in pneumatically agitated 60-L flat-panel photobioreactor system. The gas was released from Bio-CNG plant as by-product into Na 2 CO 3 -rich medium and cultivated in semicontinuous mode of operation.

As defined in economic Jargon, sustainable economic development should take into consideration the ecological sustainability. However, as Himani (2010) provided, economic development concentrates on GDP growth and ignoring the associated environmental costs and consequences of sustainable development (in Lingaraj and Shakti, 2015).The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been since 1970 pursuing five-year-development plans with the aim of diversifying its economy and reducing dependence on oil revenues. Despite the limited successes in achieving these long-term objectives, there are two recent considerable developments: first, growth of non- oil sector despite the recent fall in oil prices since 2014 has picked up independently from the oil sector. Second, there is growing awareness of the importance of achieving economic development but not at the expense of the environment. These two developments fit well with the newly announced 2030 Vision, which is a roadmap for the kingdom's economic future and hence may succeed in re-enforcing these welcomed developments.The challenges facing the country remain in having an economic diversification that benefits from greenhouse gas emission avoidances and adaptation to the impacts of climate change, as well as reducing the negative impacts of environmental policies on economic growth. The objective of economic diversification is necessary for sustainability of economic growth and development and increasing the share of non-oil sectors such as industries, energy, mining and tourism. On the other hand, this objective must be met with a reduction in the CO2 level especially as KSA has agreed to Paris climate agreement in 2015, which demands limiting warming to below 2C degree. Hence, the critical question is whether Saudi Arabia is capable of meeting its environmental obligations without compromising its economic objectives.The Intended National Determined Contribution (INDC), which was submitted in 2015 to the United Nations Framework Convention on climate change (UNFCC), presented the official position. This official document foresees that integrating climate change objectives and economic diversification will mitigate co-benefits and contribute to economic diversification through a set of measures among them are energy efficiency, renewable energies, and Carbon Capture and storage. The implementation of such plan will be challenging for KSA, but the new economic direction included the establishment of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs, which put forth a very ambitious \"2030 Vision\" with the aim of tackling these challenges especially as government revenues from oil have dropped considerably. Stevens (2015) noted the fast changes in attitudes and considerable efforts by the Saudi government in implementing these policies towards reducing pollution despite apparent negative impacts to its economy. The inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita income and income inequality Mehmet et al., (2016) cited is dated back to the study of Kuznets (1955). Based on (Kuzents, 1955), hypothesis where the relationship between economic development and environmental degradation, as Grossman and Krueger (1991) argue that the inverted U-shaped relationship is also exists between per capita income and environmental degradation. The bottom line of the hypothesis is that the inverted U-shaped relationship between per capita income growth and environmental degradation suggests that as per capita income increases, environmental degradation also increases to maximum point but then decreases and the turning point is the critical high level of income (Lingaraj and Shakti, 2015).The focus of the present paper is to investigate empirically the validity of Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis, which is the effect of income on CO2 emissions, in KSA. \u2026", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "c6106e9ab14a8c5a7bd4bdee182954a78bd10799", "externalIds": {"MAG": "145297335", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-4939-0545-4_10", "CorpusId": 127534082}, "title": "Carbon-Negative Options", "abstract": "Considering the slow progress of current carbon mitigation policies, there is a growing recognition that the low-risk levels of atmospheric CO2 cannot be achieved without a significant carbon-negative component.

The formation of focused fluid conduits initiates, when the pore pressure within a reservoir exceeds the seal\u2019s resistance against fracture or capillary failure. In seismic data, focused fluid conduits manifest as vertical zones of anomalous seismic amplitudes, which are known as seismic chimneys or pipes. The understanding of focused fluid flow manifestations is of great importance for hydrocarbon exploration because these structures may act as indicators for hydrocarbon reservoirs and sub-seafloor operations, as they may pose a hazard to drilling operations and influence the long-term efficiency sub-seabed storage of CO2. The geological storage of CO2 known as carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a key technology for the mitiga\u00action of climate sensitive greenhouse gas emissions recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Marine saline aquifers are a favorable storage option, because such systems have virtually infinite capacity, no influence on ground water production and bear the least conflict potential with the public. Howe\u00acver, the success of CCS as a climate change mitigation technology depends on its public acceptance and builds on a reliable and transparent risk assessment, which is studied by the interdisciplinary, international ECO2 project. The project\u2019s main aims are to investigate the likelihood of leakage from marine CO2 storage sites and its potential effect on marine ecosystems, to develop monitoring strategies, and to define best environmental practice guidelines for implementing and managing storage sites. Within this framework, my PhD thesis concentrates on the investigation of focused fluid conduits in the Sou\u00acthern Viking Graben and their implications for the Sleipner CO2 storage project, where CO2 is injected into a ~850 meter deep saline aquifer known as the Utsira Formation. My studies are based on the interpretation of 3D and time-lapse 4D seismic data covering more than 2000 km2 of the Southern Viking Graben, numerical fluid flow simulation, and field geological observations. My thesis builds on a detailed description of the fluid flow system in the Sleipner area, which is characterized by the interplay between deep hydrocarbon reservoirs, the Utsira Formation and the overlying strata hosting various fluid flow features. The key elements of seal-bypassing fluid flow in the strata overlying the Utsira Formation are several hundreds of meters-wide chimney structures. The study area hosts at least 46 of these focused fluid conduits, which are categorized based on their seismic appearance into three types (A, B and C). Type-A-chimney shows similarities to \u201cblowout pipes\u201d, which are known from different sedimentary basins around the world and generally associated with rapid expulsion of fluids. Type B is very similar to large \u201cgas chimney\u201d structures, which have been identified above several leaking hydrocarbon reservoirs and which are interpreted as gas filled fracture networks crosscutting a low permeable seal. Type-C-chimneys cause seismic disturbances in bands of up to 6 km length and correlate with overlying tunnel valleys. The formation of focused fluid conduits requires high pore overpressure. The analysis of the Sleipner palaeo fluid flow system indicates that there may be a link between chimney formation and the last glacial cycle. Building on this, we present a novel hypothesis, which predicts that undrained fluid flow systems could pro\u00acduce significant overpressure as a result of the interplay between loading and unloading during a glacial cycle and resulting gas compression and sediment compaction. The closest chimney structures with a probable connection to the Utsira Formation are 7 km away from the Sleipner CO2 injection point. We have evaluated the propensity of leakage along these structures by perfor\u00acming numerical modeling of the CO2 plume evolution with the multiphase fluid flow simulator DuMux. The simulations revealed that it is not likely that the modeled CO2 plume will ever reach the chimney structures. Additionally, it is unlikely that the injection of CO2 itself may cause the formation of chimney structures at Sleipner. Although seismic pipes and chimneys are very common features in seismic data and their interpretation as focused fluid flow conduits is well-established, only little is known about the underlying geological processes and how these link up with their seismic image. The comparison of field analogues of focused fluid conduits from the Colorado Plateau (USA) and seismic chimneys revealed that specific seismic signatures correlate well with certain field-based examples. The integration of field geological observations may help to improve seismic interpretations of chimney structures and fluid flow systems in general. The importance of focused fluid flow conduits for the evolution of sedimentary basins is not sufficiently addressed yet. The results of this thesis highlight the relevance of focused fluid flow conduits for long-term integrity of sub-seabed storage of CO2 operations and that focused fluid flow conduits have to be considered for site selection of storage projects. A deeper understanding of focused fluid flow will help to understand the flux of fluids from the geosphere into the hydro- and atmosphere as well as geological and climatic processes of the past and future.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "3cdb5ba434b0bdd3c6a64c6c3e3295e5e15f38ab", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2093757251", "DOI": "10.1021/CM052680G", "CorpusId": 135728448}, "title": "Site-specific biochemical functionalization along the height of vertically aligned carbon nanofiber arrays", "abstract": "Flexible strategies for the biochemical functionalization of synthetic nanoscale materials can enhance their impact upon a broader range of devices and applications.

The energy sector contributes to a large portion of the carbon emissions and a wide range of technologies need to be implemented to make the progression towards the low carbon dioxide emission. CO\u2082 capture and storage (CCS) is seen as a technology that can reduce the carbon emissions in the coal fired power stations. This will help reduce the rate of climate change by removing greenhouse gases that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere. Carbon capture and storage involves the capture of carbon dioxide gas from within the CO\u2082 generation process, compressing it into a supercritical fluid and finally sequestrating it. Implementing CCS technology for electricity production has an impact on the net power output of the power plant and it also has a high capital and operating cost. Among the different capture technologies, solvent absorption is considered to be the benchmark amongst the post-combustion carbon capture technologies. However, there are other technologies that have potential to be energy and cost competitive such as: adsorption, membranes and low-temperature separation. The aim of the PhD is to improve the integration of the capture processes with the power plant stations to reduce the energy penalty associated with the addition of CCS by combining current carbon capture technologies to form hybrid post-combustion carbon capture processes and evaluate their performances. A hybrid post-combustion carbon capture process consists of two steps: an initial recovery step would increase the concentration of CO\u2082 in the flue gas whilst trying to limit the amount of CO\u2082 lost in the waste gas. The second step would then be a purification step, where the CO\u2082 gas is purified and pressurised to the sequestration requirement. The research will develop a methodology to assess carbon capture technologies using exergy analysis, in combination with pinch analysis and optimisation methods, such as multi-objective optimisation (MOO). The hybrid carbon capture technologies is modelled using Aspen HYSYS\u00ae. These models provide the information to perform the analysis and optimisation of the power plants to determine the energy and cost targets. The two hybrid processes that were developed are VSA/low-temperature separation hybrid carbon capture processes and membrane/low-temperature separation hybrid carbon capture processes. The processes were then evaluated using MOO and the energetic and economic performance were compared to the MEA solvent absorption carbon capture processes. Hybrid carbon capture processes using technologies such as VSA, membranes and low-temperature carbon separation have shown potential to be energetically and economically competitive with the established MEA solvent absorption. The VSA/low-temperature hybrid process requires a specific shaft work of 1.46 GJe/t (CO\u2082 captured) when 90.0 % of the CO\u2082 is being recovered. The membrane/low-temperature hybrid carbon capture process required a specific shaft work of 1.38 GJe/t (CO\u2082 captured) at 90% CO\u2082 recovery rate when mixed refrigerant is used to achieve the low temperatures. On an economic perspective, the VSA/low-temperature separation hybrid process had a higher cost of avoidance of $78/t (CO\u2082 avoided) compared to the $67//t (CO\u2082 avoided) of the membrane/low-temperature separation hybrid process. Finally, beyond analysing the overall performance of the hybrid processes, the thesis allowed each hybrid process to be analysed in depth through heat integration and MOO; the energy trade-off between the CO\u2082 recovery stage and CO\u2082 purification stage was studied. The difference in using mixed ethane/propane refrigerant versus propane only refrigeration was also investigated.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "2a9717aaa783896890027392138740e63a761485", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2897420478", "DOI": "10.15781/T2TT4GB31", "CorpusId": 116317814}, "title": "Audience-Pleasing Physical Models to Support CO2 Outreach", "abstract": "Outreach to increase public understanding is critical to implementation of carbon capture and storage, but conventional lectures may fail to engage a non-technical audience.

Using interesting and engaging physical models, and without use of PowerPoint, posters or handouts, speakers can show a non-technical audience (1) how CO2 is formed from the combustion of hydrocarbon molecules (2) how much CO2 we produce in daily activities, (3) why CO2 works to trap heat in the atmosphere 4) the properties of CO2 and its health and safety risks (5) how geologic storage of CO2 would work to reduce emissions.

They are simple enough to be replicated by audience members for use in school and community programs. Objective Our objective is to provide the Carbon Capture and Storage research and outreach community with some easily transferable demonstrations that are designed to increase public understanding and comfort with issues related to greenhouse gas issues and CSS processes.

Who is doing it? Many people think that CO2 is \u201cpollution\u201d, so that clean burning should be a way to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Figure 1. Models made of Styrofoam balls are used to illustrate the chemistry of combustion. In this demonstration, we review basic chemistry (figure 1) to realize that producing CO2 is an inevitable waste product of burning any fossil fuel. FOURTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION DOE/NETL May 2-5, 2005 CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS Set up: prepare a box of different size Styrofoam balls painted to represent oxygen (largest ball, at least 3), carbon (at least one), hydrogen (smallest ball, at least four). Cut several pipe cleaner into 1 inch lengths. A candle or oil lamp is a useful prop. Ask \u201cwhat is in a hydrocarbon? \u201c(answer: hydrogen and carbon). One carbon with four hydrogens attached to it is methane, the simplest of the hydrocarbons. Have participants make some hydrocarbons by linking Styrofoam balls representing hydrogen (small) with carbon (medium sized) with short pieces of pipe cleaner. Ask \u201cHow do we get energy from hydrocarbon?\u201d (Answer: burn it, which means add oxygen to the fuel in the presence of threshold heat.) If time allows, light a candle or small oil lamp with a match, and let this sink in (hydrocarbons from candle or oil lamp, oxygen from the air). Add Styrofoam balls that represent oxygen, and pull the hydrogen off the methane (Say \u201cpop\u201d or \u201cbang\u201d as you do it to symbolize the release of energy). Add two hydrogens to each oxygen and two oxygens to each carbon to complete the chemical reactions. Ask \u201cwhat are the products of combustion of fossil fuel?\u201d and coach the audience to figure out the answer from the models (C O2 = carbon\u2013di-oxide and H2 O is water). Throw the molecules in the air to emphasize what happens to them under \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d. People are usually surprised that water is released by combustion. Ask them to think about what they have seen coming out of tail pipes of cars or from smoke stacks on a cool morning. (White \u201csmoke\u201d is water vapor condensing) You cannot see the CO2, but there is at least half as much CO2 produced as water from most kinds of combustion. Demo 2 Imagine you could see the carbon in CO2 How much CO2 is produced during combustion of fossil fuel? CO2 is a colorless gas transparent to light so it feels like it must be unimportant and harmless. This visual demonstration provides an analog to give participants a sense of the amount of carbon going into the atmosphere. Figure 2 Briquettes help people imagine the carbon in CO2 emissions. Set up: Pour the charcoal out on a white plastic bag as a visual aide (figure 2) . Explain: One gallon of gasoline has about 5.2 lbs (2.3 kg) of carbon. Charcoal briquettes are almost entirely carbon. FOURTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION DOE/NETL May 2-5, 2005 CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS A 5 lbs bag of charcoal holds about 100 briquettes At 26 miles/gallon, that's 0.2 lbs of C (about 4-5 charcoal briquettes)/mile Participants can pile the briquettes to equal the amount of carbon they release to the atmosphere during a normal drive. Conclusion \u201cA standard US car throws a charcoal briquette (or more) of carbon from its tail pipe about every 1/4 mile. If you could see the carbon that was being released when everyone threw the equivalent of a briquette out of their car every 1/4 mile would this make a difference in how people act?\u201d Demo 3 What is the Greenhouse Effect? How can increasing the a little bit of CO2 in the atmosphere increase global temperature? This visual analogy (figure 3) provides a way to think about atmospheric physics in terms of familiar objects. Figure 3. Model of the interaction of the atmosphere with light and heat. Preparation: Cut hardware cloth (wire mesh with 1/4 inch openings) into two pieces about 10\u201d by 10\u201d square. Fold heavy tape over any sharp edges to make them safe to handle. The hardware cloth helps us image how CO2 in the atmosphere interacts with light and heat energy. Whoosh the hardware cloth through the air to show there is only a little bit of wire in the hardware cloth, so it is like CO2 in the atmosphere in that there is only at little bit of CO2 mixed in with other gasses to make up the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. A pipe cleaner will represent light energy coming from the sun. Light energy has a short wavelength. We imagine the fuzz on the pipe cleaner as representing the wavelength of light. FOURTH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION DOE/NETL May 2-5, 2005 CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS Have a volunteer hold the \u201cCO2 in the atmosphere\u201d horizontally above a table, so that it looks like the atmosphere as seen from space. Show with a pipe cleaner how light from the sun can easily go right through the \u201catmosphere\u201d. After light goes through the atmosphere, it hits the earth. Who knows what happens to it then? Does all of it reflect back as light into space? Think about the effect of sunshine hitting the ground on a summer day. (Some light is absorbed by objects and the ground and then radiated as heat). Heat energy has a longer wavelength than light. We can imagine this as the pipe cleaner being bent in five or six zigzags. With your fingers, bend the pipe cleaner into a long wavelength spring. Try transmitting this long-wavelength heat energy through the CO2 in the atmosphere (hardware cloth). Much of the\u201d heat\u201d is trapped and bounces around between the atmosphere and earth. Put another sheet of hardware cloth representing more CO2 in the atmosphere. Will this make it harder for heat to escape? The CO2 rich atmosphere is trapping heat like the glass roof of a greenhouse (hence the name greenhouse effect). Demo 4 CO2 is a Gas Is CO2 dangerous? Does it explode? Can it be transported safely? This set of experiments are used in introductory physics and chemistry to examine properties of gases. Our motive here is to increase public understanding of the basic properties of CO2 so that they can be informed about safe handling and so that fears derived from absence of information will be reduced. Set-up Freeze caution: warn participants not to touch dry ice with bare skin. Using hot pads, place the dry ice block in a shallow plastic tub. The plastic will provide insulation so that the cold from the dry ice does not crack the glass. Use the ice pick to break off a number of chunks of dry ice, ice cube-size or smaller for the experiments. Place the dry ice in the tub in the bottom of a 10 gallon fish tank. In a turbulent or breezy setting it is helpful to cover the tank with a piece of newspaper to allow the CO2 to build up and to break the dry ice block into more pieces to increase the rate of sublimation. Not suitable for outside demos. Dry ice is frozen CO2. Does anyone know where the CO2 goes as the dry ice sits in the room and warms up? Do you see any liquid CO2 drips?

This dissertation is concerned with the optimal design and dispatch of a DER system installed at an industrial or commercial building. An optimization model that accurately captures typical utility costs and the physical constraints of a combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system is designed to size and operate a DER system at a building. The optimization model is then used with cooperative game theory to evaluate the financial performance of a CCHP investment. The CCHP model is then modified to include energy storage, solar powered generators, alternative fuel sources, carbon emission limits, and building interactions with public and fleet PEVs. Then, a separate plugin electric vehicle (PEV) refueling model is developed to determine the cost to operate a public Level 3 fast charging station. The CCHP design and dispatch results show the size of the building load and consistency of the thermal loads are critical to positive financial performance. While using the CCHP system to produce cooling can provide savings, heat production drives positive financial performance. When designing the DER system to reduce carbon emissions, the use of renewable fuels can allow for a gas turbine system with heat recovery to reduce carbon emissions for a large university by 67%. Further reductions require large photovoltaic installations coupled with energy storage or the ability to export electricity back to the grid if costs are to remain relatively low.When considering Level 3 fast charging equipment, demand charges at low PEV travel levels are sufficiently high to discourage adoption. Integration of the equipment can reduce demand charge costs only if the building maximum demand does not coincide with PEV refueling. Electric vehicle refueling does not typically affect DER design at low PEV travel levels, but can as electric vehicle travel increases. However, as PEV travel increases, the stochastic nature of PEV refueling disappears, and the optimization problem may become deterministic.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "428fa3b73f5b6de6b065a20cf1576d4a2f8ac695", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3082650684", "CorpusId": 226070716}, "title": "\"Modeling, performance assessment and cost estimation of a carbon capture process based on chemisorption with MEA\"", "abstract": "From the last few couples of decades, it has been seen that the greenhouse gas emissions are risen by more than one quarter and the most contribution in that, is the fast-growing amount of \u3016CO\u3017_2into the atmosphere and the major part of \u3016CO\u3017_2 comes from an energy production system. carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been adopted from the last few years to reduce the \u3016CO\u3017_2Concentration into the atmosphere even though the research is still ongoing to minimize the cost and the energy penalty to facilitate the process.

Now more than ever, it is crucial that what we do to reduce our emissions can deliver both near term and sustained positive impacts across the economy to ensure prosperity and justice in our society. This special joint paper from the Centre of Energy Policy at the University of Strathclyde (CEP) and the Bellona Foundation considers the design of a Framework for recovery that could align our near-term economic priorities with both short and medium-term climate goals. In doing so, it focuses on three key actions for achieving net zero: enabling and realising residential energy efficiency gains; facilitating the electric vehicle rollout; investing in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) infrastructure to transform process industry. We show that net zero actions can deliver the type of short term employment, real income and GDP improvements that will be crucial for near term economic recovery from the pandemic. Such actions will simultaneously deliver essential foundations for a sustainable and prosperous transition where sustained economic and societal gains are realised alongside deep emissions reductions.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "e7bbc6a8a9606306b53239803ca53bfe60014ce6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1929732280", "DOI": "10.1007/s10040-015-1321-7", "CorpusId": 128537358}, "title": "Dissolved noble gases and stable isotopes as tracers of preferential fluid flow along faults in the Lower Rhine Embayment, Germany", "abstract": "Groundwater in shallow unconsolidated sedimentary aquifers close to the Bornheim fault in the Lower Rhine Embayment (LRE), Germany, has relatively low \u03b42H and \u03b418O values in comparison to regional modern groundwater recharge, and 4He concentrations up to 1.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 cm3 (STP) g\u20131\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\u00a0% which is\u00a0approximately four orders of magnitude higher than expected due to solubility equilibrium with the atmosphere.

However, large hydraulic-head gradients observed across many faults suggest that they act as barriers to lateral groundwater flow. Therefore, the geochemical data reported here also substantiate a conduit-barrier model of fault-zone hydrogeology in unconsolidated sedimentary deposits, as well as corroborating the concept that faults in unconsolidated aquifer systems can act as loci for hydraulic connectivity between deep and shallow aquifers. The implications of fluid flow along faults in sedimentary basins worldwide are far reaching and of particular concern for carbon capture and storage (CCS) programmes, impacts of deep shale gas recovery for shallow groundwater aquifers, and nuclear waste storage sites where fault zones could act as potential leakage pathways for hazardous fluids.R\u00e9sum\u00e9L\u2019eau souterraine des aquif\u00e8res s\u00e9dimentaires meubles superficiels proches de la faille de Bornheim dans le graben du Bas-Rhin (GBR), Allemagne, pr\u00e9sente des valeurs de \u03b42H et \u03b418O relativement basses en comparaison de celles de la recharge r\u00e9gionale actuelle des eaux souterraines et des concentrations en 4He atteignant 1.7\u2009\u00d7\u200910\u22124 cm3 (STP) g\u20131\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2\u00a0% (environ 4 ordres de grandeur plus \u00e9lev\u00e9e que pr\u00e9vu en raison de l\u2019\u00e9quilibre de solubilit\u00e9 avec l\u2019atmosph\u00e8re).

Thus, the capture of SO2 gas is very important for the environment. Graphene which is twodimensional material has excellent mechanical, chemical, thermal properties, and many application areas such as energy storage devices, gas adsorption, sensing devices, and optical electronics. Further, graphene oxide (GO) is examined as a good adsorbent because of its important features such as functional groups (epoxy, carboxyl and hydroxyl) on the surface and layered structure. The SO2 adsorption properties of the fibers are usually investigated on carbon fibers. In this study, potential adsorption capacity of GO fibers was researched. GO dispersion was first obtained with Hummers\u2019 method from graphite, and then GO fibers were obtained via wet spinning process. These fibers were converted into a disc shape, dried, and then subjected to SO2 gas adsorption test. The SO2 gas adsorption capacity of GO fiber discs was investigated in the fields of utilization of different coagulation baths and reduction by hydrazine hydrate. As coagulation baths, single and triple baths were used. In single bath, only ethanol and CaCl2 (calcium chloride) salt were added. In triple bath, each bath has a different concentration of water/ethanol and CaCl2 salt, and the disc obtained from triple bath has been called as reference disk. The fibers which were produced with single bath were flexible and rough, and the analyses show that they had higher SO2 adsorption capacity than triple bath fibers (reference disk). However, the reduction process did not increase the adsorption capacity, because the SEM images showed that the layers and uniform structure in the fiber form were damaged, and reduction decreased the functional groups which SO2 will be attached. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyzes were performed on the fibers and discs, and the effects on the results were interpreted.

Methane emission mitigation activities undertaken by oil and natural gas companies prevent the loss of a valuable non-renewable resource by directing this clean energy source to beneficial use either via sales or internal use. At the same time, companies are reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases, improving operational safety and enhancing the efficiency of their operations. Further economic and operational benefits can result when methane mitigation activities reduce maintenance and fuel requirements or result in the capture of other valuable hydrocarbon resources. Numerous proven cost-effective technologies and practices exist that oil and natural gas companies have implemented to reduce methane emissions while also generating positive cash flows from utilizing the methane. This paper summarizes a number of established methods to identify, measure, and reduce methane emissions from a variety of equipment and processes in oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. The following detailed discussions provide background on expected levels of vented and fugitive methane emissions from natural gas processing plants, compressor stations, storage tanks, centrifugal compressors, and well completion activities, based on published data and industry experience. This information is supported with case studies covering mitigation activities that have been undertaken by Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (PEMEX) in Mexico, Pluspetrol in Argentina, EnCana Oil & Gas (USA), Inc. in the United States, and Gazprom in Russia. For each case study, operational, economic and environmental considerations are discussed to show how these companies are delivering greater revenue as well as environmental, efficiency and safety benefits while also conserving natural gas resources worldwide. Background By 2010, it is estimated that annual methane emissions from the global oil and natural gas industry will total 1.354 billion tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent 1. This equates to 94.2 billion m 3) worth of natural gas lost to the atmosphere. By 2020, it is anticipated that these figures will increase by 35%, reaching 1.827 billion tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent, which equates to 127.9 billion m 3 of natural gas lost to the atmosphere. Methane represented 14 percent of total anthropogenic (man-made) emissions of greenhouse gases in 2004. 2 Emissions from the oil and natural gas industry are the largest anthropogenic source and second largest overall source of global methane emissions, accounting for 18 percent \u2026", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "cc56a82a967f509ea44c771113e36a4e0aea6763", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3016026180", "CorpusId": 216741778}, "title": "Carbon sequestration and storage in Aurangabad city (M.S.)", "abstract": "Trees from urban areas can mitigate environmental degradation via trees.
