CO2 emitted out to atmosphere from the power plants utilizing fossil fuels causes major environmental pollution. Hence incorporation of carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the need of the hour even though it increase the capital cost. Therefore a decision is to be made by the investing companies either to construct conventional power plants incorporating CCS or to go for non conventional energy sources that are environment friendly. This can be represented mathematically as a Generation Expansion Planning (GEP) problem. Energy Storage System (ESSs) helps in improving the reliability of the system satisfying the economic aspects as well. Also the use of Renewable Energy Technologies (RET) can meet this objective. In view of the complications and complexities involved in the GEP incorporating renewable energy sources with or without storage facility, the Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) also plays a significant role in the electric power system expansion planning.

Without decisive action, energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) will more than double by 2050 and increased oil demand will heighten concerns over the security of supplies. We can and must change our current path, but this will take an energy revolution and low-carbon energy technologies will have a crucial role to play. Energy efficiency, many types of renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and new transport technologies will all require widespread deployment if we are to reach our greenhouse-gas emission goals. Every major country and sector of the economy must be involved. The task is also urgent if we are to make sure that investment decisions taken now do not saddle us with sub-optimal technologies in the long term. There is a growing awareness of the urgent need to turn political statements and analytical work into concrete action. To spark this movement, at the request of the G8, the International Energy Agency (IEA) is developing a series of roadmaps for some of the most important technologies. These roadmaps provide solid analytical footing that enables the international community to move forward on specific technologies. Each roadmap develops a growth path for a particular technology from today to 2050, and identifies technology, financing, policy and public engagement milestones that need to be achieved to realise the technology's full \u2026", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "c89ae61b9ea77041a0734e0ab428c449db4c8b31", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1531921463", "DOI": "10.3390/WEVJ3030519", "CorpusId": 59322127}, "title": "The role of ICEVs, HEVs, PHEVs, BEVs and FCVs in achieving stringent CO2 targets: results from global energy systems modeling", "abstract": "A modified GET model version was used to investigate long-term, cost-effective fuel and vehicle technologies for global passenger transport. The aim was to quantify the potential impact of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology and low CO2 intensity electricity from renewable sources, such as concentrating solar power (CSP), on cost-effective passenger vehicle fuel and technology options necessary to achieve stabilization of atmospheric CO2 at 450 ppm. In addition, the model was used to assess the sensitivity of future vehicle cost assumptions. For all cases investigated, there is no single technology and fuel that dominates throughout the century; instead a variety of fuels and vehicle technologies are important. The availability of CCS and CSP have a substantial impact on cost-effective fuel and technology choices, in general: (i) the introduction of CCS increases the use of coal in the energy system and conventional vehicle technology, (ii) the introduction of CSP reduces the relative cost of electricity in relation to hydrogen and tends to increase the use of electricity for transport, and (iii) the introduction of both CCS and CSP reduces the economic incentives to shift to more advanced vehicle technologies. Varying cost estimates for future vehicle technologies results in large differences in the cost-effective fuel and vehicle technology solutions. For instance, for low battery costs ($150/kWh), electrified powertrains dominate and for higher battery costs ($450/kWh), hydrogen-fueled vehicles dominate, regardless of CCS and CSP availability. The results highlight the importance of a multi-sector approach and the importance of pursuing research and development of multiple fuel and vehicle technologies.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "6eb573c46a57ffcac5794793dcb790082bde32e7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "123365368", "DOI": "10.2172/1031460", "CorpusId": 107446865}, "title": "Mountaineer Commerical Scale Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Project", "abstract": "The Final Technical documents all work performed during the award period on the Mountaineer Commercial Scale Carbon Capture & Storage project.

With the current shift towards decentralized power production, micro Gas Turbines (mGTs) appear as a promising technology for small-scale generation. The target of a carbon-clean power production calls for the implementation of Carbon Capture Use and Storage (CCUS) technologies. Compared to coal fired power production, the low CO2 concentration in the exhaust gas of a mGT makes Carbon Capture (CC) much more expensive. However, the CO2 concentration can be increased by performing Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), therefore reducing the CC energy penalty. Additionally, cycle humidification can also help to increase the electrical efficiency of the turbine plant. Nevertheless, the higher CO2 content in the inlet air, in combination with the high humidity level, will affect the operation of the mGT. This paper presents a numerical study of this innovative cycle combined with preliminary experimental validation of CO2 injection. To the authors\u2019 best knowledge, experimental analysis of EGR together with humidification applied to a mGT has never been carried out. Experimental results showed a stable turbo-machinery operation under a moderate CO2 injection.

Furthermore, the present atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is 385 ppm (parts per million) far more than at any time in the last 650,000 years resulting in climate change or global warming. Both natural and human causes of climate change including the earth\u2019s orbital changes, solar variations, ocean currents, volcanic eruptions et cetera were reviewed. These various causes have resulted in rising sea levels, melting of ice at the world\u2019s poles and on its mountains and violent downpours resulting in over flooding and submerging of coastal areas and consequent migration of animal species; heat waves leading to desertification, depletion of water availability, reduced animal metabolism and agricultural food production, loss of biodiversity, food insecurity, decreased animal health et cetera. Some measures identified to have potentials to bring about climate change mitigation including the use of carbon capture & storage (CCS) technology and trading plants for carbon as carbon tracking devises; breeding of fuzzy-leaved crops and irrigation as techniques for cooling the atmosphere. Strategies for climate change adaptation through a multi-dimensional and multi-sectoral approach have become imperative as a result of inequalities between the developed and the developing nations in terms of limited capital resources and expertise. The successes recorded so far through these efforts are encouraging but they have not been able to drastically reduce the rise in atmospheric temperature, hence the consequences abound, especially in the developing countries like Nigeria.

For example, an interdisciplinary study titled The Future of Nuclear Energy, released by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT 2003) suggests that there are four options for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from electricity: increasing efficiency, expanding renewable energy sources, capturing carbon dioxide and sequestering the carbon, and increasing use of nuclear power. This study and one of its authors have gotten considerable public attention in the past couple of years for putting the nuclear power option back on the table for discussion in the United States (Baue 2005). \n \nFurthermore, evolving nuclear power plant technologies, including one design that has been described as inherently safe (Uranium Information Centre 2005), have been making their way through the review and approval processes in other countries. The so-called pebble bed modular reactor (PBMR) is now being proposed for construction in Cape Town, South Africa, and there is a lively debate in that country about whether such a design is verifiably safe, whether the country truly needs such a power plant, where the waste would be sent and whether those affected would have a political voice in the debate, and ultimately how the effort to approve and construct a PBMR in South Africa would impact this industry in the rest of the world (Groenewald 2005; Nuclear Engineering Department, MIT 2001). This debate is still under way, and it is being watched closely by interested parties. Updated plans for the South African project will be submitted to the utility regulatory body in 2006. The PBMR design would not be acceptable under current U.S. regulations because it does not require an expensive containment dome; this means that it is less expensive to build but is more vulnerable from a security standpoint. \n \nA further question about the security of existing U.S. nuclear power plants arose in the aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Nuclear power plants appear to have been a potential target of the organizers of these attacks; therefore, the exposure of spent fuel in aboveground storage tanks on the property of many commercial plants is a concern. New security arrangements and proposals for more secure dry-storage casks have been made, but long-term secure storage of high-level reactor waste remains an unresolved problem. \n \nAs the discussion of the nuclear power option moves forward, it is critically important to consider what is now known about the health and environmental risks of the nuclear fuel cycle, based on the lessons of the past 60 years (Cardis et al. 2005; Wing et al. 1997). There is now a large body of knowledge about the impact of uranium mining and milling, transportation of partially enriched ore, fabrication of fuel-grade material, power reactor operations, and waste disposal and decommissioning of commercial reactors. We have learned from disasters such as Chernobyl [United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) 2000], as well as the less obvious but long-term problems of disposal of mine wastes and mill tailings and the ecologic impacts of this technology (Makhijani et al. 1996). We have also learned about the human health effects of low-level radiation exposure on workers exposed in the nuclear industry, most recently summarized in the BEIR (Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation) VII report [National Academy of Sciences (NAS) 2005]. The conclusions of this recent review, although couched in careful scientific language, indicate that carcinogenic effects of exposure increase proportionately with dose, especially regarding leukemia mortality, and that for some types of exposure the current regulatory controls in the United States may be insufficient. A proliferation of nuclear power plants inevitably means more nuclear workers and more residents exposed to low-level ionizing radiation, with increased health risks attendant to this exposure. \n \nThe Future of Nuclear Energy (MIT 2003) suggests that nuclear power generation of electricity is currently not cost-effective compared with other technologies. The report notes that \u201ccarbon emission credits, if enacted by government, can give nuclear power a cost advantage\u201d (MIT 2003). In fact, there are several other carbon-free or low-carbon options that are currently more cost-effective than nuclear power; these include wind power, combined-cycle gas power plants, and end-use efficiency measures. According to a recent analysis, \u201cnuclear power saves as little as half as much carbon per dollar as windpower and cogeneration, and from several-fold to at least tenfold less carbon per dollar as end-use efficiency\u201d (Lovins 2005). Lovins (2005) also succinctly added that \n \nNo other energy technology spreads do-it-yourself kits and innocent disguises for making weapons of mass destruction, nor creates terrorist targets or potential for mishaps that can devastate a region, nor creates wastes so hazardous, nor is unable to restart for days after an unexpected shutdown. \n \nThe accumulated experience of the past six decades provides ample evidence of adverse health effects in workers in the nuclear fuel cycle, the potential for disastrous accidents that lead to widespread environmental contamination, the unresolved problems of permanent and secure storage of high-level radioactive wastes, and the extraordinarily high costs of building additional nuclear power generation facilities. Some of these problems are ignored in the current public discourse, perhaps because of the immediacy of the need to solve the problems of carbon-based fuel. Given the availability of alternative carbon-free and low-carbon options and the potential to develop more efficient renewable technologies, it seems evident that public health would be better served in the long term by these alternatives than by increasing the number of nuclear power plants in the United States and the rest of the world.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "91b85324de272895d6e6fb8f0e4ff346d23c0e93", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1907163777", "DOI": "10.1002/GHG.1399", "CorpusId": 93223754}, "title": "Analysis of unusual scale build\u2010up in a CO2 injection well for a pilot\u2010scale CO2 storage demonstration project", "abstract": "An unusual scale build-up was identified with a series of analytical methods in a CO2 injection well that was part of a pilot-scale carbon capture and storage system at an active coal-fired power plant in West Virginia, USA. After over a year of operation, a decrease in injection performance was seen in wellhead pressure and flow-rate monitoring. A blockage in the injection tubing was considered the most likely problem, and samples of the scale material were collected during well maintenance activities. The scale material was analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) for identification of principal elemental species. The primary phase identified in sample was antarcticite (CaCl2\u00b76H2O) with lesser amounts of calcium chloride hydrate and halite. Review of the injection system components indicated that the calcium chloride based annular fluid in the well most likely contributed to the antarcticite precipitation. The evaporite minerals identified in the well suggest that a highly saline water mixture had been exposed to very dry, desiccating conditions related to CO2 injection, which may be present during well workovers and interruptions in injection. The scale build-up was addressed by running a gauge ring to physically remove the material and flushing the well with a light brine solution, which is not unusual for injection well operations.

Natural gas production with high content of acid gases can be a challenge, due to their corrosiveness potential in pipelines in the presence of water and H2S toxicity. On another hand, as a result of world's dependence on fossil energies, the release of carbon into atmosphere is increasing and leads to climate changes. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is one of the most promising ways to reduce CO2 emissions in the atmosphere. Whether in natural gas or carbon dioxide transport, water may be present. During production, transportation and processing, changes in temperature and pressure can lead to water condensation (cause of corrosion, and consequently a possible pipeline rupture), ice and/or gas hydrates formation.

However, in the presence of liquid water, CO2 forms corrosive carbonic acid. In order to mitigate wet CO2 corrosion, use of expensive corrosion-resistant alloys is recommended; however, the increased cost makes such selection economically unfeasible; hence, new corrosion mitigation methods are sought. One such method is the use of thermally sprayed aluminum (TSA), which has been used to mitigate corrosion of carbon steel in seawater, but there are concerns regarding its suitability in CO2-containing solutions. A 30-day test was carried out during which carbon steel specimens arc-sprayed with aluminum were immersed in deionized water at ambient temperature bubbled with 0.1\u00a0MPa CO2. The acidity (pH) and potential were continuously monitored, and the amount of dissolved Al3+ ions was measured after completion of the test. Some dissolution of TSA occurred in the test solution leading to nominal loss in coating thickness.

Since that time, science has advanced in areas such as geophysics, chemical engineering, monitoring and verification, and other areas, while also governments have funded demonstration projects at various sizes ranging from small-scale proof of concept to industrial-scale demonstration projects. Five industrial-scale CCS projects are currently operational globally with more than 0.035 Pg of CO2 captured and stored since 1996. Observations from these industrial scale projects and commercial CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR), engineered natural analogues as well as theoretical consideration, models and laboratory studies have suggested that appropriately selected and well managed CCS sites are likely to retain almost all of injected CO2 for long time and provide the benefits for the intended purpose of CCS. However, CCS is still struggling to gain foothold as one of the main options for mitigating climate change due to high costs, advances in other options including renewable energy, as well as discovery of shale natural gas and the associated hydrological fracturing extraction techniques, absence of international action by governments and private sectors on climate change, economic crisis-induced low carbon (C) prices, and public skepticism. The estimated costs for CCS varies widely depending on the application\u2014such as gas clean-up versus electricity generation, type of fuel, capture technology , and assumptions about the baseline technology. Generally, for current technology, CCS would increase cost of generating electricity by 50\u2013100%, and parasitic energy requirement of 15\u201330%. In this case, capital costs and energy requirements are the major cost drivers. In addition, significant scale-up compared to existing CCS activities will be needed to achieve intended large reductions of CO2 emissions. For example, a 5- to 10-fold scale-up in the size of individual projects is needed to capture and store emissions from a typical coal-fired power plant of 500\u20131000 MW, while a thousand-fold scale-up in size of current CCS enterprise would be needed to reduce emissions by 1 Pg C yr\u22121. The estimated global oil and gas reservoirs are 1000 Pg CO2, saline aquifers global potential capacity ranges from 4000 to 23,000 Pg CO2. However, there is considerable debate about how much storage capacity actually exists and is available for CCS, particularly in saline aquifers. Research, improved geological assessments and commercial scale demonstration projects will be needed to verify the estimated capacity and improve confidence in storage capacity estimates.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "b1af60b2aa688d346e4e6836d9c86742d9f64a4d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2062242697", "DOI": "10.1016/J.EGYPRO.2009.02.259", "CorpusId": 110829797}, "title": "The EU enabling legal framework for carbon capture and geological storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "2757bbe41e147f9dedd09c0ff94b4c07a7c2ecfd", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fenrg.2021.626538", "CorpusId": 233312706}, "title": "Negative CO2 Emissions for Transportation", "abstract": "Negative emission technologies have recently received increasing attention due to climate change and global warming. One among them is bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), but the capture process is very energy intensive. Here, a novel pathway is introduced, based on second-generation biofuels followed by carbon circulation in an indefinitely closed chain, effectively resulting in a sink. Instead of using an energy-intensive conventional CCS process, the application of an on-board solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) running on biofuels in an electric vehicle (FCEV) could result in negative emissions by capturing a concentrated stream of CO2, which is readily stored in a second tank. A CO2 recovery system at the fuel station then takes the CO2 from the tank to be transported to storage locations or to be used for local applications such as CO2-based concrete curing and synthesis of e-fuels. Incorporating CO2 utilization technologies into the FCEVs-SOFC system can close the carbon loop, achieving carbon neutrality through feeding the CO2 in a reverse-logistic to a methanol plant. The methanol produced is also used in SOFCs, leading to an infinite repetition of this carbon cycle till a saturation stage is reached. It is determined this pathway will reach typical Cradle-to-Grave negative emissions of 0.515 ton CO2 per vehicle, and total negative CO2 emission of 138 Mt for all passenger cars in the EU is potentially achievable.

I2CNER was inaugurated as the sixth institute of the World Premier International Research Center (WPI) Initiative by the Japanese Ministry for Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in 2010. I2CNER is an international collaboration between Japan and the US, based at Kyushu University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, respectively. At I2CNER, our mission is to contribute to the creation of a sustainable and environmentally friendly society by conducting fundamental research underlying current technologies that advance increased efficiency in energy conversion and energy use and reduce the carbon emission of fuel and electricity generation. This collection of papers explores fundamental science problems in solid oxide fuel cells and electrolyzers; energy storage; fuel generation; production, storage, and utilization of hydrogen as a fuel; and CO2 capture membranes. We would like to draw attention to the fact that the research outlined in these papers in most cases involves researchers from multiple universities. More specifically, these collaborative efforts truly bear the mark of I2CNER because they were enabled by the framework of the I2CNER-WPI project. In the area of oxide cells, Staykov and his collaborators seek the origin of surface electrons that participate in oxygen reduction reactions for SrO-terminated surface of SrTiO3 and iron-doped SrTiO3; Staykov et al. compared bulk density of states (DOS) to near-surface DOS. Their calculations demonstrate that the conduction band, which is formed mainly by the d-states of Ti, and Fe-induced states within the band gap of SrTiO3 are accessible only on TiO2-terminated SrTiO3 surface, while the SrO-terminated surface introduces a tunneling barrier for the electrons populating the conductance band [1]. Perry and her collaborators compare approaches to measure oxygen surface exchange kinetics, by simultaneous optical transmission relaxation (OTR) and AC-impedance spectroscopy (ACIS) in the same mixed conducting SrTi0.65Fe0.35O3\u2212x film by accounting for the presence and condition of the metal current collectors (Pt, Au). The results suggest that, while the current collector might influence measurements by AC-IS, the OTR method offers a continuous, in situ, and contact-free method to measure oxygen exchange kinetics at the native surfaces of thin films [2]. The team of Kilner uses secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiling to study 18O and 2H diffusion at 300 \u00b0C temperature in the double perovskite material PrBaCo2O5+\u03b4 (PBCO) in flowing air containing 200 mbar of H2 16O. The team found that PBCO still retains significant oxygen diffusivity and that the presence of water (H2 16O) enhances the surface exchange rate over that in pure oxygen by a factor of ~3. In addition, studying the three-dimensional 2H distribution, they found it to be inhomogeneous and probably related to the presence of hydrated layers in the interior walls of pores, thus not being due to proton diffusion. Kilner et al. concluded that PBCO acts mainly as an oxygen ion mixed conductor when used in proton-conducting ceramic fuel cells [3]. In the area of photelectrochemical water splitting, Ghuman explores alternative routes for the development of inexpensive and abundant catalysts for water splitting. She studied pristine and Fe2+-doped amorphous titanium dioxide (aTiO2) photocatalysts through density functional theory with Hubbard energy correction and found that pristine amorphous (a)TiO2 surface is capable of anchoring H2O molecules more strongly than the doped aTiO2 as well as the rutile (110) surface. In addition, she found that the water dissociation barrier on pristine aTiO2 catalyst is reduced significantly when aTiO2 is doped with Fe 2+ [4]. Continuing her work on the chemistry of small molecules, Ogo et al. mechanistically investigated the catalytic H2 evolution from formic acid in water using a formate-bridged dinuclear Ru complex as a formate hydrogen lyase model [5]. Watanabe reviews the fundamental principles and recent developments in the area of hydrogen production by artificial photosynthesis. In particular, he focuses on the photocatalytic water splitting through composite organic/ inorganic photocatalysts [6]. Kearney et al. review and discuss how density functional theory and finite-element device simulations can be used to gain insights into charge transport across modified photoelectrodes in photoelectrochemical water-splitting [7]. In the area of energy storage and fuel generation, Yamauchi and her co-workers propose a promising new carbon-neutral approach to energy storage (fuel generation) and power generation based on the glycolic acid (GC)/oxalic acid (OX) redox couple. Studying the catalytic activity of various transition metals, they identified Rh, Pd, Ir, and Pt to be most effective for the electrochemical oxidation of GC. In addition, Yamauchi et al. found that OX electroreduction for the selective formation of GC, which proceeds through successive two-electron reductions, is facilitated by TiO2 catalysts with large specific area [8].

In this article, downsizing is referred to as the deliberate production of typical large MOF crystals into their nanosized versions. Here, we discuss various strategies towards the formation of crystals below 100\u2009nm and their impact on the nano-MOF crystal properties. Strategies include an adjustment of the synthesis parameters (e.g., time, temperature, and heating rate), surface modification, ligand modulation, control of solvation during crystal growth and physical grinding methods. These approaches, which are categorized into bottom-up and top-down methods, are also critically discussed and linked to the kinetics of MOF formation as well as to the homogeneity of their size distribution and crystallinity. This collection of downsizing routes allows one to tailor features of MOFs, such as the morphology, size distribution, and pore accessibility, for a particular application. This review provides an outlook on the enhanced performance of downsized MOFs along with their potential use for both existing and novel applications in a variety of disciplines, such as medical, energy, and agricultural research. Methods for enhancing the properties of porous materials known as metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) by making the crystals smaller have been reviewed by scientists in Australia and the Philippines. MOF crystals have an open atomic structure which includes large voids. MOFs are highly crystalline materials, typically generated in powder form, useful for applications such as hydrogen storage and carbon capture. Reducing the crystal sizes to nanometer scales significantly enhances the material\u2019s physical and chemical properties. Ken Usman, Ludovic Dum\u00e9e and Joselito Razal from Deakin University, Geelong, Australia, and co-workers have reviewed the latest methods for synthesizing MOF crystals smaller than a hundred nanometers. Synthesis strategies include altering a wide range of parameters such as time, temperature and heating rate. The authors show how these different approaches allow the properties of nano-sized MOF, including morphology and size distribution, to be controlled to suit a specific application. Metal organic frameworks are typically synthesized at the macroscale, into powders, films or as coatings generated across appropriate supporting materials. The downsizing of metal\u2013organic frameworks offers opportunities to not only benefit from their properties at the nanoscale but also to enhance surface interactions and reactivities.

In order to achieve a significant reduction in CO2, it is necessary to establish not only CO2 capture and storage (CCS), but also a wide range of technologies such as CO2 conversion to alcohol fuels such as methanol, utilization as chemical raw materials, and so on (CO2 capture and utilization CCU). The establishment of utilization technology aimed at reducing CO2 will contribute to \u201c7. Use of renewable feedstocks\u201d and \u201c9. Catalyst\u201d from the 12 principles of green chemistry. CO2 utilization technology can be divided into two categories: multi-electron reduction with multiple protons and binding to organic molecules. In the former case, CO, formic acid, and methanol are produced, so no extension of the carbon number of the target product is observed. In the latter case, CO2 is bonded to the organic molecule as a carboxyl group, so that a C\u2013C bond can be newly built. In other words, with the latter technology, it becomes possible to fix CO2 to organic molecules and create new functional materials. For example, natural photosynthesis skilfully utilizes sunlight as a renewable energy and enzyme catalysts to synthesize glucose from CO2 and water as a raw material. In other words, CCU technology based on mimicking natural photosynthesis contributes to the above principles of green chemistry. To establish this technology, a catalyst that promotes the binding of CO2 to organic molecules is an essential factor. In other words, it is necessary to develop a catalyst for activating C\u2013H bonds in organic molecules and promoting C\u2013C bond formation with CO2. In this review, molecular and enzyme-based catalysts for C\u2013H bond activation and building C\u2013C bonds with CO2 applicable to light-driven CCU using a photoredox system are introduced. Moreover, light-driven C\u2013H bond activation and building C\u2013C bonds with CO2 using various catalysts and photofunctional materials are also introduced.

However, the potential risk of gas leakage from CO2 sequestration and utilization processes has attracted considerable attention. Moreover, leakage might threaten soil ecosystems and thus cannot be ignored. In this study, a simulation experiment of leakage from CO2 geological storage was designed to investigate the short-term effects of different CO2 leakage concentration (from 400 g m\u22122 day\u22121 to 2,000 g m\u22122 day\u22121) on soil bacterial communities. A shunt device and adjustable flow meter were used to control the amount of CO2 injected into the soil. Comparisons were made between soil physicochemical properties, soil enzyme activities, and microbial community diversity before and after injecting different CO2 concentrations. Increasing CO2 concentration decreased the soil pH, and the largest variation ranged from 8.15 to 7.29 (p < 0.05). Nitrate nitrogen content varied from 1.01 to 4.03 mg/Kg, while Olsen-phosphorus and total phosphorus demonstrated less regular downtrends. The fluorescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolytic enzyme activity was inhibited by the increasing CO2 flux, with the average content varying from 22.69 to 11.25 mg/(Kg h) (p < 0.05). However, the increasing activity amplitude of the polyphenol oxidase enzyme approached 230%, while the urease activity presented a similar rising trend. Alpha diversity results showed that the Shannon index decreased from 7.66 \u00b1 0.13 to 5.23 \u00b1 0.35 as the soil CO2 concentration increased.

CO2 concentrations greater than 32% in the isolated soil environment revealed a previously unknown whole plant stomatal response. Time course measurements of stomatal conductance (gs ), leaf temperature and leaf abscisic acid (ABA) show strong coupling between all three variables over a specific period (3 h following CO2 gassing) occurring as a result of CO2 -specific detection by roots.

The thermodynamic properties of CO2 are different from those of other gases such as natural gas that are transported in pipelines. Recent full-scale burst tests from the projects SARCO2 and COOLTRANS indicated significant variations in correction factors necessary to predict the arrest of a running ductile fracture. In addition, CO2 can be a potential hazard to human and animal life and the environment. While consequence distances of natural gas pipelines are well established and documented in standards, this is not the case with CO2.\n The research focused CO2SAFE-ARREST joint industry project (JIP) aims to (1) investigate the fracture propagation and arrest characteristics of anthropogenic CO2 carrying high strength steel pipelines, and (2) to investigate the dispersion of CO2 following its release into the atmosphere. The participants are DNV GL (Norway) and Energy Pipelines CRC (Australia). The project is funded by the Norwegian CLIMIT and the Commonwealth Government of Australia. The joint investigation commenced in 2016 and will continue to 2019.\n The experimental part of the project involves two full-scale fracture propagation tests using X65, 610mm (24\u201c) pipe and two 6\u2033 shock tube tests, with all tests filled with a dense phase CO2/N2 mixture. The full-scale tests were made up of 8 pipe lengths each, with nominal wall thicknesses of 13.5 mm and 14.5mm. The dispersion of the carbon dioxide from the full-scale test sections was measured through an array of sensors downwind of the test location. The tests were conducted in 2017/2018 at Spadeadam, UK.\n Following a short review of the background and outcomes of previous CO2 full-scale burst tests, this paper provides insight on the aims of the overall experimental program along with summary results from the first full-scale fracture propagation test, carried out in September 2017. Two companion papers provide further details on the first test.

For example, the IEA currently suggests that 160GW of CCS may need to be installed globally by 2030 as part of action to limit greenhouse gas concentrations to 550ppm-CO2 eq, with a further 190GW CCS capacity required if a 450ppm-CO2 eq target is to be achieved. Since global rollout of proven CCS technologies is not expected to commence until 2020 at the earliest this represents a very challenging build rate. In these circumstances retrofitting CO2 capture to existing plants, probably particularly post-combustion capture on pulverized coal-fired plants, could play an important role in the deployment of CCS as a global strategy for implementing CO2 emissions reductions. Retrofitting obviously reduces the construction activity required for CCS deployment, since fewer additional new power plants are required. Retrofitting CCS to an existing fleet is also an effective way to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from this sector of the electricity generation mix; it is obviously not possible to effect an absolute reduction in coal power sector CO2 emissions simply by adding new plants with CCS to the existing fleet. Although it has been proposed that plants constructed now and in the future can be \u2018capture ready\u2019, much of the existing fleet will not have been designed to be suitable for retrofit of CO2 capture. Some particular challenges that may be faced by utilities and investors considering a retrofit project are discussed. Since it is expected that post-combustion capture retrofits to pulverized coal plants will be the most widely applied option for retrofit to the existing fleet (probably regardless of whether base plants were designed to be capture ready or not), a review of the technical and potential economic performance of this option is presented. Power cycle performance penalties when capture is retrofitted need to be addressed, but satisfactory options appear to exist. It also seems likely that the economic performance of post-combustion capture retrofit could be competitive when compared to other options requiring more significant capital expenditure. Further work is, however, required both to develop a generally accepted methodology for assessing retrofit economics (including consideration of the implications of lost output after retrofit under different electricity selling price assumptions) and to apply general technical principles to case studies where site-specific constraints are considered in detail. The overall conclusion from the screening-level analysis reported in this paper is that, depending on project-specific and market-specific conditions, retrofit could be an attractive option, especially for fast track initial demonstration and deployment of CCS. Any unnecessary regulatory or funding barriers to retrofit of existing plants and to their effective operation with CCS should, therefore, be avoided.Copyright \u00a9 2009 by ASME", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "689e4fb7c367b2eb2e15e8404be724471ebec34d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2382424032", "CorpusId": 111801648}, "title": "Analysis of life cycle GHGS emission of coal-based methanol", "abstract": "Applying the input-output method to LCA,the input-output hybrid LCA assessment is established.With this method,life cycle greenhouse gases emission of coal-based Methanol 100 as an alternative vehicle fuel are analyzed.Compared with traditional gasoline with same heat value,coal-based M100 will result heavier greenhouse effect.So application of carbon captured and storage equipments is suggested in the production stage and the combustion efficiency of coal should be improved greatly.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "25b35b16b01e84e6277f0c9ee0c13a0127196154", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2011078978", "DOI": "10.2118/139840-PA", "CorpusId": 109787185}, "title": "A Practical Way Out of the GHG Emissions Problem", "abstract": "Ever-increasing global demand for energy, and the world's supply predominantly being fossil-based, implies continued growth of emissions. Efficiency improvements and employment of non-fossil energy will definitely help mitigate the problem, but it is generally recognized that \"pure carbon offsets\" will have to play a major role if the problem has to be combated in a timely fashion. Discussion on pure offsets employing geological storage [namely, carbon capture and storage (CCS)] is advancing rapidly. However, major issues with this approach are its high cost and the long-term post operation liability. The author has previously proposed an alternate approach of pure offset - charcoal sequestration (CS), which essentially employs conversion of dead plant material into inert solid carbon. CS promises to be both less expensive and a better option as far as the operational and post-operation liability is concerned. Among the numerous advantages of the charcoal approach is its easier reversibility, both in terms of liability and costs. Although implementation of this approach at a scale where it can make a signif icant impact on global CO 2 concentration needs to be preceded by a substantial information dissemination and public preparedness, a practical way to introduce it is through using municipal solid waste (MSW) as the feed biomass for CS. This will not only allow time for public acceptance to evolve, and evaluation of potential associated risks, but immediately help mitigate the growing problem of space requirement for waste landfills, waste transport costs and emission of methane from the rotting municipal waste associated with the continued urban sprawl. This paper, aside from describing the carbon sequestration from waste (CSW) method, estimates the cost of carbon offset with this and other competing approaches, such as the use of MSW for conversion to bio-alcohol and for power generation. It highlights that to make our mobile and stationary use of energy carbon-neutral, different types of carbon offsets are needed and makes a case for price duality of carbon credits. It also compares the global potential of CSW in combating the greenhouse gas (GHG) problem, making more than two Socolow wedges with use of charcoal for soil enhancement and other purposes amounting to less than 0.04 such wedges. In this work, the cost of carbon offset with CSW is estimated to be as low as CAD 2.6/ tonne CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 e).", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "8d3759feb41835725579faff3e9665cf8454c635", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2499631229", "CorpusId": 113520632}, "title": "Carbon capture and storage: UK\u2019s fourth energy pillar, or broken bridge?", "abstract": "CCS power is the only way to burn fossil fuel with lower emissions, and will be essential to fill in electricity generation gaps on weeks when wind does not blow across the EU.

However, injectivity was shown by the in situ monitoring data to be substantially increasing over the years. Previous numerical analyses suggest that such reservoir behavior might be mainly attributed to the permeability heterogeneity of the injection layers. As an intermittent injection procedure was actually practiced in this project, the hysteretic behaviors in relative permeability and capillary pressure in the reservoir could be significant. In this study, the hysteretic processes are investigated for a better understanding of the reservoir performance. History\u2010match is achieved with one order of magnitude lower in the overall permeability of the principal injection layer than the previous simulation. Current calibrated permeability is much closer to seismic measurement and well\u2010log results.

As environmental concerns over carbon emissions escalate, development of a practical carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has become an important issue. Combining IGCC and CCS has become a promising technology to reduce the cost of CCS. This study investigates the pros and cons of different methods used to put together an approximately 250 MW IGCC plant with and without CCS by using the commercial software Thermoflow. Seven different IGCC plants have been designed with various parameters examined, including: oxygen-blown vs. air-blown, with/without integration, with/without CCS, sour vs. sweet water shift for carbon capture, and dry- vs. slurry-fed. This study is based on technologies that are commercially available or close to commercialization. The results show that:(a) integration between the gas turbine and the air separation unit (ASU) can boost the cycle efficiency about 4.5% (1.6 percentage points);(b) dry-feeding increases the CO content, the syngas heating value (19%), and the efficiency about 11% (4.7 percentage points);(c) carbon capture reduces the power output by 2.7% and efficiency by 10% (or 4.5 percentage points) and the slurry-fed system takes a heavier toll on power output and efficiency than the dry-fed system;(d) air-blown systems do away with the ASU, resulting in syngas with a 50% lower heating value and a small reduction in efficiency, but harvesting savings on reduced capital, operating, and maintenance costs;(e) for CO2, sweet water shift results in 5.5% (2 percentage points) higher cycle efficiency than sour shift.Copyright \u00a9 2012 by ASME", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "74f36ba4f82b0a57d2c1fe7d564bde978baabe68", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2565167141", "CorpusId": 100119762}, "title": "Dual alkali approaches for the capture and separation of CO{sub 2}", "abstract": "The Solvay process utilizes two alkalis in sequential order to convert CO{sub 2} to sodium carbonate for commercial use.

The compression of the captured carbon dioxide stream requires significant amounts of power and can impact plant availability, and increase operational costs. Preliminary analysis has estimated that the CO2 compression process reduces plant efficiency by 8% to 12% for a typical power plant. This project supports the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) objective of reducing energy requirements for carbon capture and storage in electrical power production. The primary objective of this study is to boost the pressure of CO2 to pipeline pressures with the minimal amount of energy required. Previous thermodynamic analysis identified optimum processes for pressure rise in both liquid and gaseous states. Isothermal compression is well known to reduce the power requirements by minimizing the temperature of the gas entering subsequent stages. Intercooling is typically accomplished using external gas coolers and integrally geared compressors. For large scale compression, use of straight through centrifugal compressors, similar to those used in oil and gas applications including LNG production, is preferred due to the robustness of the design. However, intercooling between each stage is not feasible. The current research develops an internally cooled compressor diaphragm that removes heat internal to the compressor. Results documenting the design process are presented including 3D conjugate heat transfer CFD studies.

The oxygen carrier is oxidized in air and subsequently transferred to a separate reactor in which it reacts with the fuel. The produced CO2 is inherently separated from the air components, making CLC a promising technology for carbon capture and storage (CCS). CLC of biomass combined with CCS (bioenergy CCS; BECCS) is a way to generate negative CO2 emissions and thus interesting for climate change mitigation. Undesirable chemical reactions between ash and oxygen carriers are a challenge in BECCS because of the reactive nature of biomass ash. This article examines two low-cost steel industry byproducts that have shown desirable fuel conversion properties in CLC: iron mill scale (Glodskal B) and steel converter slag (LD-slag). Their interactions with potassium ash model compounds (KCl, K2CO3,K2SO4, and KH2PO4) in a reducing atmosphere have been investigated. Mixtures of oxygen carriers and potassium salt have been reduced for 6 h in CO and steam in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor at 850 \u00b0C. The reduced samples have been analyzed with SEM/EDS and XRD. The reactivity of the mixtures during reduction and oxidation has also been examined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). K2CO3 increased the reaction rate for the reduction of Glodskal and inhibited the reactivity of LD-slag. KH2PO4 formed a K\u2212P\u2212Fe component with apparent low melting temperature with Glodskal, causing agglomeration, and decreased the reduction/oxidation rate in TGA. KH2PO4 formed a K\u2212P\u2212Ca component with apparent high melting temperature with LD-slag causing agglomeration but the reduction rate was not affected.

The large scale solution to the problem of CO2 emissions currently being considered is carbon capture and storage (CCS). In CCS, the CO2 is first separated from the flue gas by capture techniques and then later stored underground. This method does not eliminate CO2; it just stores it. Environmental threats of escape are spurring re-evaluation of CCS to eliminate CO2 rather than move and store it. A more attractive solution would be carbon capture and utilization (CCU) in which the waste CO2 is not dumped, but converted into a commercially valuable product.

Cold-water coral ecosystems are threatened by future changes in carbonate chemistry, yet our knowledge of the response of these corals to high temperature and high CO2 conditions is limited. Dimethylsulphoniopropionate (DMSP), and its breakdown product dimethylsulphide (DMS), are putative antioxidants that may be accumulated by invertebrates via their food or symbionts, although recent research suggests that some invertebrates may also be able to synthesise DMSP.

In both high temperature treatments, intracellular DMSP was similar to the control treatment, whilst dissolved DMSP\u00a0+\u00a0DMS was not significantly different between any of the treatments. These results suggest that L. pertusa accumulates DMSP from the surrounding water column; uptake may be up-regulated under high CO2 conditions, but mediated by high temperature.

Nanoporous solids with high accessible specific surface area and pore volume, high chemical and mechanical stability are considered as one of the key materials to solve many energy and environment-related problems. Abundant porous carbon materials have attracted great attention in hydrogen/meth-ane storage, and carbon capture. Graphene-based materials are relatively new members of the carbon family and opened up great scope for molecular sorption, storage and separa tion due to the flexibility in designing functionalized surfaces and tuneable porosities. In this chapter, we describe recent research efforts to synthesize a variety of graphene-based structures, starting with layered, expanded graphite, interca lation, exfoliation, chemical reduction, pillaring layers, self assembly, surface functionalization, doping, metal dispersion, porous template, chemical activation, and hierarchical pore structures for hydrogen/methane storage and carbon capture. Graphene oxide (GO, also known as graphite/graphitic oxide) was first prepared by Brodie (1859). It is an oxidized graphite compound, with a nominal C:O ratio between 2 and 3, usually obtained by treating graphite with strong oxidizers: Mixtures of nitric/sulfuric acid, sodium nitrate, and potassium/chlo-rate/permanganate (Dreyer et al. 2010, 2012; Hummers and Offeman 1958). Structurally, GO is a layered structure with an interlayer spacing of about 0.7 nm, twice that of graphite (Barroso-Bujans et al. 2010; Burress et al. 2010; Dreyer et al. 2010). The GO structure contains abundant oxygen-rich func tional groups: Hydroxide and epoxide groups on basal planes, and carbonyl and carboxyl groups on the edges of graphene sheets. This makes GO hydrophilic in nature and soluble in water and several solvents (Dreyer et al. 2010). GO with its lamellar water, a largely expanded and tunable layered struc ture provides a rich platform for a wide range of functional ity and reaction sites for chemical modifications. Thus, GO becomes a more popular and versatile precursor for the syn thesis of large-scale graphene-related materials (Aboutalebi et al. 2012; Chandra et al. 2012; Li and Shi 2012; Liu et al. 2013; Srinivas et al. 2010, 2011, 2012; Yang et al. 2013). A variety of GO-based porous network structures are discussed in this chapter, particularly for hydrogen/methane storage and carbon (dioxide) capture. These include simple, single- to few-layer randomly arranged graphenes through thermal exfoliation of GO, well-ordered and pillared layer structures of GO, and chemically activated GO, with tunable and functional pore structures and large internal surface area.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "a87681a8e18cd576fa7e5a8b2bc6c1ac2de4b12d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1991438949", "DOI": "10.1080/10485231009709880", "CorpusId": 129782846}, "title": "Carbon Recycling: An Alternative to Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a classical \u201cend of the pipe\u201d techno-fix for the problem of carbon dioxide pollution of Earth's atmosphere.

Many innovative carbon recycling methods are currently being pursued, including biochemical, electrochemical, photochemical, and thermochemical processes aimed at converting CO2 to a variety of commercially valuable products. All such processes require a net input of energy to drive endothermic reactions, but some are slow and others require extreme operating conditions.

In order to ensure that a CCS project reach the required level of success, three essential elements need to be guaranteed; storage capacity, injectivity and containment. Among these elements, relatively less research has been conducted relevant to the injectivity, thus there are several technical uncertainties in this regard that should be understood and quantified in order to ensure long-term storage of CO2. This thesis is therefore centered at improving such knowledge and understanding by addressing some of the vague research areas in regard to CO2 injectivity including: CO2/H2O mutual solubilities, salt precipitation and depositional heterogeneities. First part of this study is devoted to thermodynamic modeling of fluid mixtures relevant for CO2 storage with particular focus on effect of methane (CH4) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) impurities. To do this, a molecular based framework, Statistical Association Fluid Theory (SAFT) is chosen and the molecular parameters required by the model were adjusted against the available experimental data. The developed model is effectively used to predict phase partitioning, the aqueous phase density and water drop-out in contact with solid surface, which we believe to be especially well-suited to the assessment of injectivity of a proposed CO2 storage reservoir. In the next part of this thesis, the processes of drying-out and salting-out were explored in more detail. This work encompasses the fabrication of the two sets of glass microchips, as well as series of experimental characterisation that has given us a valuable insight into the mechanism of salt precipitation. In particular, we have identified two mechanisms which together dramatically intensify the precipitation rate and amount of salt precipitated. From this insight, the reported discrepancies in the literature regarding the salt precipitation could be successfully explained and a new prototype for modeling of the process could be provided. We have also studied, but to a lesser extend, the effect of prepositional heterogeneities on the plume migration and pressure response at the injection well. We came to the conclusion that extreme well and aquifer pressures are unlikely for the setting studied in this thesis.

Underground gas storage operations and CO2 sequestration in aquifers relay on both the proper wellbore construction and sealing properties of the cap rock. CO2 injection candidates may be new wells or old wells. In both cases, the long-term wellbore integrity (up to 1 000 years) is one of the key performance criteria in the geological storage of CO2. The potential leakage paths are the migration CO2 along the wellbore due to poor cementation and flow through the cap rock. The permeability and integrity of the set cement will determine how effective it is in preventing the leakage. The integrity of the cap rock is assured by an adequate fracture gradient and by sufficient set cement around the casing across the cap rock and without a micro-annulus. CO2 storage in underground formations has revived the researc of long term influence of the injected CO2 on Portland cements and methods for improving the long term efficiency of the wellbore sealant. Some researchers predicted that set cement will fail when exposed to CO2 leading to potential leakage to the atmosphere or into underground formations that may contain potable water. Other researchers show set cement samples from 30 to 50 year-old wells (CO2 EOR projects) that have maintained sealing integrity and prevented CO2 leakage, in spite of some degree of carbonation. One of reasons for the discrepancy between certain research lab tests and actual field performance measurements is the absence of standard protocol for CO2 resistance-testing devices, conditions, or procedures.

The HyMethShip system will achieve a reduction in CO2 of more than 97% and practically eliminate SOx and PM emissions. NOx emissions will fall by over 80%. below the IMO Tier III limit. The energy efficiency of the HyMethShip system is expected to be more than 45% greater than the best available technology (renewable methanol as the fuel coupled with conventional post-combustion carbon capturing). The HyMethShip system innovatively combines a membrane reactor, a CO2 capture system, a storage system for CO2 and methanol as well as a hydrogen-fueled combustion engine into one system. Methanol is reformed to hydrogen, which is then burned in a conventional reciprocating engine that has been upgraded to burn multiple fuel types and specially optimized for hydrogen use. The basic engine type is the same as the one currently used on the majority of ships. This project will develop this system further and integrate it into shipboard installations.

The sources of CO2 include natural gas processing and other processes. The current technology to mitigate CO2 is carbon capture, storage and utilisation. At the same time, oil production is expected to increase due to the higher consumption. CO2 geological storage in depleting oilfield coupled with enhanced oil recovery can be a better technology to meet both requirements. The excellent example of this technology is the Weyburn Project in Canada that can store CO2 and produce more oil as well as prolong the reservoir life. From this successful project, the technology is studied by applying it with the depleting oilfield for both oil production and CO2 storage in the North of Thailand by using simulation model. It becomes the objective of this research, which is to evaluate CO2 geological storage coupled with water alternating gas (WAG) for enhanced oil recovery as well as to study the effects the parameters, such as total hydrocarbon pore volume (HCPV) injection and WAG ratio, on oil production and CO2 consumption and sequestration for enhanced oil recovery, with the added benefit of carbon sequestration. CMG software from Computer Modeling Group Ltd. is used to create the 3D simulation model to predict the CO2 storage in the geological formation. From the simulation, the results reported that oil can be produced up to 125,976 m3 of oil or 57 % recovery, CO2 consumption is 66,261 m3 of gas and CO2 utilisation is approximately 0.53 m3 of gas per m3 of oil. The main parameters for WAG process is WAG ratio in that oil production increases as WAG ratio increases. CO2 consumption increases with total HCPV injection.

However, recent research raises questions about the effective climate impacts of blue hydrogen from a life cycle perspective. Our analysis sheds light on the relevant issues and provides a balanced perspective on the impacts on climate change associated with blue hydrogen. We show that such impacts may indeed vary over large ranges and depend on only a few key parameters: the methane emission rate of the natural gas supply chain, the CO2 removal rate at the hydrogen production plant, and the global warming metric applied. State-of-the-art reforming with high CO2 capture rates combined with natural gas supply featuring low methane emissions does indeed allow for substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions compared to both conventional natural gas reforming and direct combustion of natural gas. Under such conditions, blue hydrogen is compatible with low-carbon economies and features climate change impacts in line with green hydrogen from electrolysis supplied with renewable electricity.

The analyzed system comprises four main subsystems: a biomass-fired combined heat and power plant integrated with a CO 2 capture and compression unit, a CO 2 transport pipeline, a CO 2 -enhanced geothermal system, and a supercritical CO 2 Brayton power cycle. For the purpose of the comprehensive techno-economic assessment, the results for the reference biomass-fired combined heat and power plant without CO 2 capture are also presented. Based on the proposed framework for energy and economic assessment, the energy efficiencies, the specific primary energy consumption of CO 2 avoidance, the cost of CO 2 avoidance, and negative CO 2 emissions are evaluated based on the results of process simulations. In addition, an overview of the relevant elements of the whole system is provided, taking into account technological progress and technology readiness levels. The specific primary energy consumption per unit of CO 2 avoided in the analyzed system is equal to 2.17 MJ LHV /kg CO 2 for biomass only (and 6.22 MJ LHV /kg CO 2 when geothermal energy is included) and 3.41 MJ LHV /kg CO 2 excluding the CO 2 utilization in the enhanced geothermal system. Regarding the economic performance of the analyzed system, the levelized cost of electricity and heat are almost two times higher than those of the reference system (239.0 to 127.5 EUR/MWh and 9.4 to 5.0 EUR/GJ), which leads to negative values of the Net Present Value in all analyzed scenarios.

The emission of CO2 from the fossil fuel power plants is the key pollutant that is causing a major threat to the environment. So the conventional power plants are required to incorporate with carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems, and this increases the capital cost of the power plants. Hence it becomes a big decision for the investors in the electricity generation sector to make either to invest in construction of fossil fuel-fired plants with CCS or in the units that are free from pollutants such as nuclear and renewable energy systems. This decision making can be mathematically expressed all the way through generation expansion planning (GEP) problem. Due to its large-scale, long-term, non-linear, and discrete nature of generation unit size, GEP becomes a very challenging task. To improve the power system reliability with efficient economic operation, Energy storage systems (ESSs) has been a very effective means of obtaining this objective, whereby based on technology employed the energy is stored in a certain form and is transformed to electrical energy when desired.

It quantifies the effect of the availability of biomass resources and technologies within a general equilibrium framework. We assess the robustness of this technology, with and without carbon capture and storage, as a way of reaching the 550 ppm stabilization target. The impact of a uniform CO2 tax on energy prices and world GDP is examined, together with the structure of the electricity mix. The influence of additional climate mitigation policies, such as alternative recycling of tax revenues and infrastructure policies is also discussed.Biomass-fed integrated gasification combined cycle technology is introduced into the electricity module of IMACLIM-R, a hybrid general equilibrium model. The modeling exercise has revealed the sometimes complex dynamics of the links between electricity production and prices, fossil fuel markets and demand for energy at various time horizons. The availability of carbon capture and storage creates a path dependency and conditions the evolution of the electricity mix and the low availability of biomass resources can result in very high unforeseen economic costs. CCS technologies are beneficial to the economy in the short to medium term, when fossil fuel resources remain available and relatively cheap. However, in the longer term, economies are locked in an electricity mix that is greatly dependent on the use of fossil fuels. The unavailability of CCS combined with the low availability of biomass resources induces extremely high costs in the long term. Without CCS, the use of biomass then becomes one of the few remaining options to produce low-carbon electricity, making biomass a robust technology option. The macroeconomic cost of climate mitigation is in part driven by the increase in production costs in all sectors and the increase in consumer prices, due to higher fossil fuel prices.

Net global CO2 emissions, in particular, must eventually be brought to or below zero. Emissions reductions of this magnitude will require large-scale transformations in human societies, from the way that we produce and consume energy to how we use the land surface. The more ambitious the stabilization goal, the more rapid this transformation must occur. A natural question in this context is what will be the transformation pathway toward stabilization; that is, how do we get from here to there? \n \nThe topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is motivated primarily by three questions. First, what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways including, for example, the goal itself, the emissions pathway to the goal, the technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation, the nature of international coordination, and mitigation policies? Second, what are the key decision making outcomes of different transformation pathways, including the magnitude and international distribution of economic costs and the implications for other policy objectives such as those associated with sustainable development? Third, how will actions taken today influence the options that might be available in the future? \n \nTwo concepts are particularly important for framing any answers to these questions. The first is that there is no single pathway to stabilization of GHG concentrations at any level. Instead, the literature elucidates a wide range of transformation pathways. Choices will govern which pathway is followed. These choices include, among other things, the long-term stabilization goal, the emissions pathway to meet that goal, the degree to which concentrations might temporarily overshoot the goal, the technologies that will be deployed to reduce emissions, the degree to which mitigation is coordinated across countries, the policy approaches used to achieve these goals within and across countries, the treatment of land use, and the manner in which mitigation is meshed with other policy objectives such as sustainable development. \n \nThe second concept is that transformation pathways can be distinguished from one another in important ways. Weighing the characteristics of different pathways is the way in which deliberative decisions about transformation pathways would be made. Although measures of aggregate economic implications have often been put forward as key deliberative decision making factors, these are far from the only characteristics that matter for making good decisions. Transformation pathways inherently involve a range of tradeoffs that link to other national and policy objectives such as energy and food security, the distribution of economic costs, local air pollution, other environmental factors associated with different technology solutions (e.g., nuclear power, coal-fired carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS)), and economic competitiveness. Many of these fall under the umbrella of sustainable development. \n \nA question that is often raised about particular stabilization goals and transformation pathways to those goals is whether the goals or pathways are \"feasible\". In many circumstances, there are clear physical constraints that can render particular long-term goals physically impossible. For example, if additinional mitigation beyond that of today is delayed to a large enough degree and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options are not available (see Section 6.9), a goal of reaching 450 ppm CO2eq by the end of the 21st century can be physically impossible. However, in many cases, statements about feasibility are bound up in subjective assessments of the degree to which other characteristics of particular transformation pathways might influence the ability or desire of human societies to follow them. Important characteristics include economic implications, social acceptance of new technologies that underpin particular transformation pathways, the rapidity at which social and technological systems would need to change to follow particular pathways, political feasibility, and linkages to other national objectives. A primary goal of this chapter is to illuminate these characteristics of transformation pathways.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "93da6f4210ad81d59ff5f8444ac536b509646cdf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2116030397", "DOI": "10.1007/S11149-013-9220-0", "CorpusId": 154417841}, "title": "Flexible mandates for investment in new technology", "abstract": "Environmental regulators often seek to promote forefront technology for new investments; however, technology mandates are suspected of raising cost and delaying investment. We examine investment choices under an inflexible (traditional) emissions rate performance standard for new sources. We compare the inflexible standard with a flexible one that imposes an alternative compliance payment (surcharge) for emissions in excess of the standard. A third policy allows the surcharge revenue to fund later retrofits. Analytical results indicate that increasing flexibility leads to earlier introduction of new technology, lower aggregate emissions and higher profits. We test this using multi-stage stochastic optimization for introduction of carbon capture and storage, with uncertain future natural gas and emissions allowance prices. Under perfect foresight, the analytical predictions hold. With uncertainty these predictions hold most often, but we find exceptions. In some cases investments are delayed to enable the decision maker to discover additional information.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "aeaac606f5f57ff11682b93065de1cdc201387ca", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1985866708", "DOI": "10.1002/GHG.44", "CorpusId": 109897640}, "title": "When once is not enough: accounting for CO2 recycling in EOR operations", "abstract": "Funding for carbon capture and storage (CCS) demonstration projects is currently under lots of pressure.

One of the processes which are used in the industry to remove the acid gases from natural gas is alkanolamines process application. In present paper, a simulation study for an industrial gas sweetening plant has been investigated based on data from gas reservoir located in the south part of Iran. The aim of study is to investigate the effect of using mixed amines as solvent on the gas treatment process. At first simulation tuned with existing gas sweetening plant which uses MDEA solvent and then application of mixed amines has been investigated in constant amine concentration for a variety of cases. Simulation results show that application of MDEA/MEA (39.5/8 wt. %) or MDEA/DEA (23.75/23.75 wt. %) in lieu of MDEA (47.5 wt. %) will reduce H2S content below 3.5 ppm like MDEA, however CO2 concentration could be substantially decreased to less than 100 versus 10,000 ppm which is desired for downstream applications, further more this approach will create opportunities for pollution control through carbon capture and storage without any major change in existing plant.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "473b1d099c6d9f4b5b65192728cc64bbd7bfdaba", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2156375982", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-008-9397-X", "CorpusId": 154593235}, "title": "\u201cBiosphere carbon stock management: addressing the threat of abrupt climate change in the next few decades.\u201d By Peter Read. An editorial comment", "abstract": "Read\u2019s (2008) essay on the option of biosphere carbon stock management (BCSM) nicely connects a number of climate-related themes which he has extensively published on during the past few decades: concern about abrupt climate change (ACC) due to system nonlinearities; inclusion of ACC in the precautionary principle; the underestimation of the short-term contribution to addressing climate change when the use of bio energy would significantly increase; the carbon capture potential of investment in undercapitalised, often degraded land; the potential of \u2018negative emissions scenarios\u2019 by linking biomass production to carbon capture and storage (CCS); and, finally, the point that emissions caps would in many respects be inferior to obligations to introduce policy-desirable technologies. The basic argument he unfolds in his essay is quite straightforward: the maximum impact of an \u2018aggressive\u2019 mitigation-oriented climate policy regime (i.e. a regime beyond the most ambitious publicly stated mitigation targets) is CO2-stabilisation at 400\u2013450 ppm by 2050\u20132100. Only a few people believe such a stabilisation can be achieved. Consequently, one should be prepared to face stabilisation of emissions at (significantly) higher levels. Because of the immanent threat of ACC, the precautionary principle should be applied not only to deal with the risks of climate change, but also to deal with the risk of abrupt climate change. In order to achieve lower emission levels sooner, a more extensive policy package is required than what we have been witnessing thus far (at least in the public statements). The best option for such a package would be BCSM, combined with CCS. The essay raises a number of questions:", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "8b19f235cf29d13b38292bd8e10d11d896ba8447", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2337998363", "DOI": "10.1080/15567036.2011.631965", "CorpusId": 112546551}, "title": "Green Balance Software: An Integrated Model for Screening of CO2-EOR and CCS Projects", "abstract": "An integrated model is proposed for simultaneous study of CO2-flood enhanced oil recovery and sequestration in both technical and economic points of view.

This software benefits users to do sensitivity analyses in extended times, easily and quickly. Several sensitivity analyses were done and effects of reservoir parameters and economic expenditures and taxes were studied. Among all affecting parameters, the role of tax per CO2 emission is the most important one. The use of adjusted tax, scaled for each project\u2019s operational expenditures, is recommended.

Japanese utility companies are advancing various measures to improve plant thermal efficiency and to promote utilization of biomass as a fuel. In Europe and America, CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technology is regarded as one effective approach, and various demonstration projects are planned all over the world. However, the introduction of conventional CO2 capture system to power station causes a decrease in the plant thermal efficiency and an increase in the power generating cost. In this reason, it is necessary to develop a new power generating system with high thermal efficiency. Therefore, Central Research Institute of Electric Power Industry (CRIEPI) proposed an innovative integrated coal gasification combined cycle power generating system (IGCC) with CO2 capture whose plant thermal efficiency is very high, and is working on the research and development of the new system. This is a system to combine a new oxygen-CO2 blown coal gasifier in that captured CO2 is used with the closed gas turbine in which coal gas from the gasifier is burned with the gas mixed oxygen and recycled exhaust CO2 . The system has the following features. The gasification performances improve greatly. The processes of concentrating and separating CO2 are unnecessary. It is estimated that the carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) and the cold gas efficiency (CGE) in oxygen-CO2 blown gasifier improve more than conventional oxygen blown gasifiers by the effect of the gasification reaction promotion of CO2 by gasifying coal with oxygen and CO2 . As a result, the gasifier and the char recycling system can make to compact, and the equipment cost can be reduced. This paper reports on examination of CO2 promotion effect on the gasification performances by gasification test using a bench scale gasifier facility.Copyright \u00a9 2011 by ASME", "year": 2011}]}
