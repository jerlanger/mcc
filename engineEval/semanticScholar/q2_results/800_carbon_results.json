Because of the low prices of fossil fuels and lesser statutory restrictions in developing countries (which are primarily dependent on this form of energy), aided by slow development and high cost of alternative energy projects, the CO2 emission into the atmosphere has been ever increasing. The long lasting effects of such high levels of CO2 in atmosphere can portray an image of an impending catastrophe but a better approach would be to avoid those and look into the solutions to minimize the CO2 levels in atmosphere.

In order to assess whether such shortages could jeopardise the objectives of the EU\u2019s Strategic Energy Technology Plan (SET Plan), an improved understanding of these risks is vital. In particular, this report examines the use of metals in the six low carbon energy technologies of SET Plan, namely: nuclear, solar, wind, bioenergy, carbon capture and storage (CCS) and electricity grids. The study looks at the average annual demand for each metal for the deployment of the technologies in Europe between 2020 and 2030. The demand of each metal is compared to the respective global production volume in 2010. This ratio (expressed as a percentage) allows comparing the relative stress that the deployment of the six technologies in Europe is expected to create on the global supplies for these different metals. The study identifies 14 metals for which the deployment of the six technologies will require 1% or more (and in some cases, much more) of current world supply per annum between 2020 and 2030. These 14 metals, in order of decreasing demand, are tellurium, indium, tin, hafnium, silver, dysprosium, gallium, neodymium, cadmium, nickel, molybdenum, vanadium, niobium and selenium. The metals are examined further in terms of the risks of meeting the anticipated demand by analysing in detail the likelihood of rapid future global demand growth, limitations to expanding supply in the short to medium term, and the concentration of supply and political risks associated with key suppliers. The report pinpoints 5 of the 14 metals to be at high risk, namely: the rare earth metals neodymium and dysprosium, and the by products (from the processing of other metals) indium, tellurium and gallium. The report explores a set of potential mitigation strategies, ranging from expanding European output, increasing recycling and reuse to reducing waste and finding substitutes for these metals in their main applications. A number of recommendations are provided which include: ensuring that materials used in significant quantities are included in the Raw Materials Yearbook proposed by the Raw Materials Initiative ad hocWorking Group, the publication of regular studies on supply and demand for critical metals, efforts to ensure reliable supply of ore concentrates at competitive prices, promoting R&D and demonstration projects on new lower cost separation processes, particularly those from by product or tailings containing rare earths, collaborating with other countries/regions with a shared agenda of risk reduction, raising awareness and engaging in an active dialogue with zinc, copper and aluminium refiners over by product recovery, creating incentives to encourage by product recovery in zinc, copper and aluminium refining in Europe, promoting the further development of recycling technologies and increasing end of life collection, measures for the implementation of the revised WEEE Directive, and investing broadly in alternative technologies. It is also recommended that a similar study should be carried out to identify the metal requirements and associated bottlenecks in other green technologies, such as electric vehicles, low carbon lighting, electricity storage and fuel cells and hydrogen.

A top-down energy-economy model is used that has three emission reduction options: energy savings, a transition towards less carbon-intensive or non-carbon energy resources, and the use of carbon dioxide capture and storage technology. Five policy instruments - carbon taxes, fossil fuel taxes, non-carbon (renewable) energy subsidies, a portfolio standard for the carbon intensity of energy production, and a portfolio standard for the use of non-carbon (renewable) energy resources - are compared in terms of costs, efficiency and their impact on the composition of the energy supply system. One of our main conclusions is that a carbon intensity portfolio standard, involving the recycling of carbon taxes to support renewables deployment, is the most cost-efficient way to address the problem of global climate change.

On land, the majority of the sequestered carbon enters soil carbon stores. Almost one-third of that soil carbon can be found in peatlands, an area covering just 2\u20133% of the Earth\u2019s landmass. Peatlands are thus well established as powerful agents of carbon capture and storage; the preservation of archaeological artefacts, such as ancient bog bodies, further attest to their exceptional preservative properties. Peatlands have higher carbon storage densities per unit ecosystem area than either the oceans or dry terrestrial systems. However, despite attempts over a number of years at enhancing carbon capture in the oceans or in land-based afforestation schemes, no attempt has yet been made to optimize peatland carbon storage capacity or even to harness peatlands to store externally captured carbon. Recent studies suggest that peatland carbon sequestration is due to the inhibitory effects of phenolic compounds that create an \u2018enzymic latch\u2019 on decomposition.

However, there are few empirical measurements of long-term carbon storage in mangroves or of how storage varies across environmental gradients. The context dependency of this process combined with geographically limited field sampling has made it difficult to generalize regional and global rates of mangrove carbon sequestration. This has in turn hampered the inclusion of sequestration by mangroves in carbon cycle models and in carbon offset markets. The purpose of this study was to estimate the relative carbon capture and storage potential in natural and restored mangrove forests. We measured depth profiles of soil organic carbon content in 72 cores collected from six sites (three natural, two restored, and one afforested) surrounding Muisne, Ecuador. Samples up to 1 m deep were analyzed for organic matter content using loss-on-ignition and values were converted to organic carbon content using an accepted ratio of 1.72 (g/g). Results suggest that average soil carbon storage is 0.055 \u00b1 0.002 g cm\u22123 (11.3 \u00b1 0.8% carbon content by dry mass, mean \u00b1 1 SE) up to 1 m deep in natural sites, and 0.058 \u00b1 0.002 g cm\u22123 (8.0 \u00b1 0.3%) in restored sites. These estimates are concordant with published global averages. Evidence of equivalent carbon stocks in restored and afforested mangrove patches emphasizes the carbon sink potential for reestablished mangrove systems. We found no relationship between sediment carbon storage and aboveground biomass, forest structure, or within-patch location.

Most proposed methods would capture CO2 from concentrated sources like power plants. Indeed, on-site capture is the most sensible approach for large sources and initially offers the most cost-effective avenue to sequestration. For distributed, mobile sources like cars, on-board capture at affordable cost would not be feasible. Yet, in order to stabilize atmospheric levels of CO2, these emissions, too, will need to be curtailed. This paper suggests that extraction of CO2 from air could provide a viable and cost-effective alternative to changing the transportation infrastructure to non-carbonaceous fuels. Ambient CO2 in the air could be removed from natural airflow passing over absorber surfaces. The CO2 captured would compensate for CO2 emission from power generation two orders of magnitude larger than the power, which could have instead been extracted from the same airflow by a windmill of similar size. We outline several approaches, and show that the major cost is in the sorbent recovery and not in the capture process. Air extraction is an appealing concept, because it separates the source from disposal. One could collect CO2 after the fact and from any source. Air extraction could reduce atmospheric CO2 levels without making the existing energy or transportation infrastructure obsolete. There would be no need for a network of pipelines shipping CO2 from its source to its disposal site. The atmosphere would act as a temporary storage and transport system. We will discuss the potential impact of such a technology on the climate change debate and outline how such an approach could actually be implemented.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "6ce846cbcc8b9be128f0c4b45a3acb4bf82aed72", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "3276408", "MAG": "2127985009", "DOI": "10.1186/1750-0680-7-1", "CorpusId": 10019327, "PubMed": "22244260"}, "title": "Estimates of carbon stored in harvested wood products from the United States forest service northern region, 1906-2010", "abstract": "BackgroundGlobal forests capture and store significant amounts of CO2 through photosynthesis. When carbon is removed from forests through harvest, a portion of the harvested carbon is stored in wood products, often for many decades. The United States Forest Service (USFS) and other agencies are interested in accurately accounting for carbon flux associated with harvested wood products (HWP) to meet greenhouse gas monitoring commitments and climate change adaptation and mitigation objectives. This paper uses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) production accounting approach and the California Forest Project Protocol (CFPP) to estimate HWP carbon storage from 1906 to 2010 for the USFS Northern Region, which includes forests in northern Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, and eastern Washington.ResultsBased on the IPCC approach, carbon stocks in the HWP pool were increasing at one million megagrams of carbon (MgC) per year in the mid 1960s, with peak cumulative storage of 28 million MgC occurring in 1995. Net positive flux into the HWP pool over this period is primarily attributable to high harvest levels in the mid twentieth century. Harvest levels declined after 1970, resulting in less carbon entering the HWP pool. Since 1995, emissions from HWP at solid waste disposal sites have exceeded additions from harvesting, resulting in a decline in the total amount of carbon stored in the HWP pool. The CFPP approach shows a similar trend, with 100-year average carbon storage for each annual Northern Region harvest peaking in 1969 at 937,900 MgC, and fluctuating between 84,000 and 150,000 MgC over the last decade.ConclusionsThe Northern Region HWP pool is now in a period of negative net annual stock change because the decay of products harvested between 1906 and 2010 exceeds additions of carbon to the HWP pool through harvest. However, total forest carbon includes both HWP and ecosystem carbon, which may have increased over the study period.

However adding amine-storage to a CCS system implies a significant capital cost that will be outweighed by the price-arbitrage revenue only if the difference between low and high electricity prices is substantial.

We then look at wholesale electricity markets in the Eastern Interconnect of the United States to determine profitability of amine-storage systems in this region.

In this paper we begin to map out some of the key issues associated with CCS, using a multi-criteria approach to explore how an (admittedly small) selection of stakeholders perceive alternative storage options and energy scenarios. We present five long-term scenarios describing alternative ways in which the UK energy system could develop and which deploy different levels of carbon storage.

The relative performance of the scenarios and the storage \nreservoirs included within them have been assessed against a set of socio-economic, technical and environmental criteria by a small selection of stakeholders to the carbon storage debate. Whilst we cannot make strong conclusions regarding precise stakeholder opinions at this stage due to the small size of the sample, the broad delineation of the arguments for and against CCS are evident.

Land-use modification strategies reduce the cost of limiting atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but can make crop prices rise and transform human diets, for example, when people consume less beef and other carbon-intensive protein sources. The rate at which crop productivity is improved has a strong influence on emissions from land-use change. Thus, the technology used for growing crops is potentially as important for limiting atmospheric CO2 as are approaches like CO2 capture and storage. Technologies for growing crops are potentially as important for limiting the concentration of atmospheric CO2 as are those for capture and storage. Limiting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations to low levels requires strategies to manage anthropogenic carbon emissions from terrestrial systems as well as fossil fuel and industrial sources. We explore the implications of fully integrating terrestrial systems and the energy system into a comprehensive mitigation regime that limits atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that this comprehensive approach lowers the cost of meeting environmental goals but also carries with it profound implications for agriculture: Unmanaged ecosystems and forests expand, and food crop and livestock prices rise.

It has been revealed that coordination polymer networks (CPNs) with channels or pores can be applied in gas storage, 2] gas separation, ion exchange, and selective adsorption of organic or inorganic molecules. 5\u20137] It has been reported that large amounts of CO2 can be adsorbed in some CPNs, for example 20 wt% at 195 K and 1 bar in [{Cu(pyrdc)(bpp)}2]n (pyrdc = pyridine2,3-dicarboxylate, bpp = 1,3-bis(4-pyridyl)propane), 16 wt % at 298 K and 50 atm in [Cu(dhbc)2(4,4\u2019-bpy)] (dhbc = 2,5-dihydroxybenzoate, bpy = bipyridine), 114 wt% at 195 K and 1 bar in SNU-6, 150 wt % at 298 K and 42 bar in MOF-177, and 176 wt % at 303 K and 50 bar in MIL-101c. However, the selective capture of CO2, in particular at ambient temperature and pressure, from industrial emission streams that contain other gases such as N2, CH4, and H2O still remains challenging. [1c,10, 11] Our approach to selectively capturing CO2 with porous materials is based on the construction of highly flexible 3D coordination polymer networks whose channels or pores open and close depending on the gas type. Compared to N2 and H2, we expected that CO2 would interact with the host network more efficiently because of its quadrupole moment ( 1.4 10 39 C m) and open up channels that are closed for other gases. Our design strategy for flexible 3D networks is to use 2D grids formed from square-planar Ni macrocyclic complexes as linear linkers 6, 7a,b, 12] and 1,1\u2019-biphenyl-3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019tetracarboxylate (bptc ) as a square organic building block, and then to connect the 2D grids with highly flexible alkyl pillars by utilizing alkyl-bridged Ni bismacrocyclic complexes such as [Ni2L ](ClO4)4 (A) and [Ni2L ](ClO4)4\u00b78 H2O (B, Scheme 1). We previously prepared a 2D pillared bilayer network that behaves like a sponge from other Ni bismacrocyclic complexes and 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate. The formation of either 2D or 3D pillared network depends on how the bismacrocyclic complex connects 2D planes (Chart S1 in the Supporting Information), which is affected by the pore size of the 2D layer and the steric hindrance between the pillars. Herein, we report two flexible 3D coordination polymer networks, [(Ni2L )(bptc)]\u00b76H2O\u00b73DEF (1, DEF = N,N-diethylformamide) and [(Ni2L )(bptc)]\u00b714H2O (2), which exhibit highly selective CO2 adsorption over N2, H2, and CH4 gases as well as thermal stability up to 300 8C and air and water stability. The CO2 adsorption isotherms of 1 and 2 show gate opening and closing phenomena as well as hysteretic desorption, which allow efficient CO2 capture, storage, and sensing. Compounds 1 and 2 are the first 3D pillared networks assembled from Ni bismacrocyclic complexes. The self-assembly of A and H4bptc in DEF/H2O/TEA (2:3:0.16, v/v; TEA = triethylamine) yielded violet crystals of 1. The self-assembly of B and Na4bptc in DEF/H2O (1:4, v/v) afforded 2. Compounds 1 and 2 are insoluble in water and common organic solvents such as MeOH, EtOH, MeCN, chloroform, acetone, toluene, dimethylformamide, and dimethylsulfoxide. In the X-ray crystal structure of 1 (Figure 1), each Ni macrocyclic unit of A is coordinated by two bptc ligand at the trans positions, and each bptc ligand binds four Ni ions belonging to four different bismacrocyclic complexes to construct 2D grids extending parallel to the ab plane. The 2D grid generates rhombic cavities with effective sizes of 3.32 8.14 , each of which involves four Ni macrocyclic units and four bptc units.

Renewable and clean sources of energy have been proposed, including wind and solar, but they are intermittent and require efficient and scalable energy storage technologies. Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides a valuable approach in this area. It combines solar- or wind-generated electrical production with energy storage in the chemical bonds of carbon-based fuels. It can provide ways to integrate carbon capture, utilization, and storage in energy cycles while maintaining controlled levels of atmospheric CO2. Electrochemistry allows for the utilization of an electrical input to drive chemical reactions. Because CO2 is kinetically inert, highly active catalysts are required to decrease reaction barriers sufficiently so that reaction rates can be achieved that are sufficient for electrochemical CO2 reduction. Given the reaction barriers associated with multiple electron-proton reduction of CO2 to CO, formaldehyde (HC(O)H), formic acid, or formate (HC(O)OH, HC(O)O-), or more highly reduced forms of carbon, there is also a demand for high selectivity in catalysis. Catalysts that have been explored include homogeneous catalysts in solution, catalysts immobilized on surfaces, and heterogeneous catalysts. In homogeneous catalysis, reduction occurs following diffusion of the catalyst to an electrode where multiple proton coupled electron transfer reduction occurs. Useful catalysts in this area are typically transition-metal complexes with organic ligands and electron transfer properties that utilize combinations of metal and ligand redox levels. As a way to limit the amount of catalyst, in device-like configurations, catalysts are added to the surfaces of conductive substrates by surface binding, in polymeric films, or on carbon electrode surfaces with molecular structures and electronic configurations related to catalysts in solution. Immobilized, homogeneous catalysts can suffer from performance losses and even decomposition during long-term CO2 reduction cycles, but they are amenable to detailed mechanistic investigations. In parallel efforts, heterogeneous nanocatalysts have been explored in detail with the development of facile synthetic procedures that can offer highly active catalytic surface areas. Their high activity and stability have attracted a significant level of investigation, including possible exploitation for large-scale applications. However, translation of catalytic reactivity to the surface creates a new reactivity environment and complicates the elucidation of mechanistic details and identification of the active site in exploring reaction pathways. Here, the results of previous studies based on transition-metal complex catalysts for CO2 electroreduction are summarized. Early studies showed that transition-metal complexes of Ru, Ir, Rh, and Os, with well-defined structures, are all capable of catalyzing CO2 reduction to CO or formate. Derivatives of the complexes were surface attached to conducting electrodes by chemical bonding, noncovalent bonding, or polymerization. The concept of surface binding has also been extended to the preparation of surface area electrodes by the chemically controlled deposition of nanostructured catalysts such as nano tin, nano copper, and nano carbon, all of which have been shown to have high selectivities and activities toward CO2 reduction.

(A) The isoreticular expansion of MOFs maintains the network\u2019s topology by using an expanded version of the parent organic linker. Examples of catalysis in MOFs are shown in the large space created by IRMOF-74-XI; Me is a methyl group. (B) Conceptual illustration of a multivariate MOF (MTV-MOF) whose pores are decorated by heterogeneous mixtures of functionalities that arrange in specific sequences. (Background) Optical image of zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) crystals. Advances The ability to vary the size and nature of MOF structures without changing their underlying topology gave rise to the isoreticular principle and its application in making MOFs with the largest pore aperture (98 \u00c5) and lowest density (0.13 g/cm3). This has allowed for the selective inclusion of large molecules (e.g., vitamin B12) and proteins (e.g., green fluorescent protein) and the exploitation of the pores as reaction vessels. Along these lines, the thermal and chemical stability of many MOFs has made them amenable to postsynthetic covalent organic and metal-complex functionalization. These capabilities enable substantial enhancement of gas storage in MOFs and have led to their extensive study in the catalysis of organic reactions, activation of small molecules (hydrogen, methane, and water), gas separation, biomedical imaging, and proton, electron, and ion conduction. At present, methods are being developed for making nanocrystals and supercrystals of MOFs for their incorporation into devices. Outlook The precise control over the assembly of MOFs is expected to propel this field further into new realms of synthetic chemistry in which far more sophisticated materials may be accessed. For example, materials can be envisaged as having (i) compartments linked together to operate separately, yet function synergistically; (ii) dexterity to carry out parallel operations; (iii) ability to count, sort, and code information; and (iv) capability of dynamics with high fidelity. Efforts in this direction are already being undertaken through the introduction of a large number of different functional groups within the pores of MOFs. This yields multivariate frameworks in which the varying arrangement of functionalities gives rise to materials that offer a synergistic combination of properties. Future work will involve the assembly of chemical structures from many different types of building unit, such that the structures\u2019 function is dictated by the heterogeneity of the specific arrangement of their constituents. Strategies for Metal-Organic Frameworks Metal-organic frameworks are porous materials that can exhibit very high surface areas that have potential for applications such as gas storage and separation, as well as catalysis. Furukawa et al. (1230444) review the structures devised so far and discuss the design strategies that allow families of materials to be synthesized and modified with similar framework topology but vary in pore size and type of functional groups present on the linkers. Crystalline metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are formed by reticular synthesis, which creates strong bonds between inorganic and organic units. Careful selection of MOF constituents can yield crystals of ultrahigh porosity and high thermal and chemical stability. These characteristics allow the interior of MOFs to be chemically altered for use in gas separation, gas storage, and catalysis, among other applications. The precision commonly exercised in their chemical modification and the ability to expand their metrics without changing the underlying topology have not been achieved with other solids. MOFs whose chemical composition and shape of building units can be multiply varied within a particular structure already exist and may lead to materials that offer a synergistic combination of properties.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "c5366cf892f48ed6fe53cffe89ce3b30b6fe6fa5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2077510398", "DOI": "10.1039/c0nr00042f", "CorpusId": 5521640, "PubMed": "20680200"}, "title": "Sorbents for CO(2) capture from flue gas--aspects from materials and theoretical chemistry.", "abstract": "Predictions of future climate change have triggered a search for ways to reduce the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

The objective of reducing global greenhouse gases (GHG) requires increasing carbon storage in pools other than the atmosphere. Growing more forests and keeping forests as forests are only part of the solution, because focusing solely on the sequestration benefits of the forests misses the important (and substantial) carbon storage and substitution GHG benefits of harvested forest products, as well as other benefits of active forest management. Forests and global climate are closely linked in terms of carbon storage and releases, water fluxes from the soil and into the atmosphere, and solar energy capture. Understanding how carbon dynamics are affected by stand age, density, and management and will evolve with climate change is fundamental to exploiting the capacity for sustainably managed forests to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. For example, even though temperate forests continue to be carbon sinks, in western North America forest fires and tree mortality from insects are converting some forests into net carbon sources. Expanding forest biomass use for biofuels and energy generation will compete with traditional forest products, but it may also produce benefits through competition and market efficiency. Short-rotation woody crops, as well as landowners\u2019 preferences\u2014based on investment-return expectations and environmental considerations, both of which will be affected by energy and environmental policies\u2014have the potential to increase biomass supply. Unlike metals, concrete, and plastic, forest products store atmospheric carbon and have low embodied energy (the amount of energy it takes to make products), so there is a substitution effect when wood is used in place of other building materials. Wood used for energy production also provides substitution benefits by reducing the flow of fossil fuel\u2010based carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The value of carbon credits generated by forest carbon offset projects differs dramatically, depending on the sets of carbon pools allowed by the protocol and baseline employed. The costs associated with establishing and maintaining offset projects depend largely on the protocols\u2019 specifics. Measurement challenges and relatively high transaction costs needed for forest carbon offsets warrant consideration of other policies that promote climate benefits from forests and forest products but do not require project-specific accounting. Policies can foster changes in forest management and product manufacture that reduce carbon emissions over time while maintaining forests for environmental and societal benefits. US policymakers should take to heart the finding of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in its Fourth Assessment Report when it concluded that \u201cIn the long term, a sustainable forest management strategy aimed at maintaining or increasing forest carbon stocks, while producing an annual sustained yield of timber, fibre, or energy from the forest, will generate the largest sustained mitigation benefit.\u201d A rational energy and environmental policy framework must be based on the premise that atmospheric greenhouse gas levels are increasing primarily because of the addition of geologic fossil fuel\u2010based carbon into the carbon cycle.

Integrating RED into a global carbon market lowers the estimated total costs of a policy to achieve 535 ppmv of CO2-equivalent concentrations in 2100 by up to 25 per cent. Alternatively, a global RED program could enable additional reductions of about 20 ppmv by 2100 with no added costs compared with an energy-sector-only policy. The results indicate that market linkage of RED induces modest reductions in clean energy innovation overall but slightly enhances development of particular technologies, including carbon capture and storage.

A growing body of empirical research demonstrates how local forest governance can be as, if not more, effective than centralized state-based regimes. Local forest governance can secure improvements in multiple forest outcomes such as biomass and carbon storage and livelihoods contributions for the poor, and it can do so at lower cost than is possible through centralized governance. Many national governments have implicitly recognized these findings in their pursuit of decentralized forest governance and in strengthening local rights and capacities to use and manage forests. However, such reforms are often politically resisted, particularly where the value of forest resources is high and central government bodies are able to capture the majority of benefits. Ongoing negotiations related to the design and delivery of REDD policy and practice must take into account both the importance of local forest governance arrangements and the political\u2013economic barriers to devolving secure rights over forests to local communities. These political dimensions of forest tenure and policy create a paradox for REDD: increasing the value of forest resources through global carbon markets without attending to local governance and rights will create political incentives towards centralized governance, which could lead to greater forest loss and lower forest-related benefits for the poor.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "f21db23f0293e37df891edfc99351bb89174abc5", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "7486778", "MAG": "3080506706", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1920877117", "CorpusId": 221308165, "PubMed": "32839342"}, "title": "Robust paths to net greenhouse gas mitigation and negative emissions via advanced biofuels", "abstract": "Significance The climate benefits of cellulosic biofuels have been challenged based on carbon debt, opportunity costs, and indirect land use change, prompting calls for withdrawing support for research and development. Using a quantitative ecosystem modeling approach, which explicitly differentiates primary production, ecosystem carbon balance, and biomass harvest, we show that none of these arguments preclude cellulosic biofuels from realizing greenhouse gas mitigation. Our assessment illustrates how deliberate land use choices support the climate performance of current-day cellulosic ethanol technology and how technological advancements and carbon capture and storage addition could produce several times the climate mitigation potential of competing land-based biological mitigation schemes. These results affirm the climate mitigation logic of biofuels, consistent with their prominent role in many climate stabilization scenarios. Biofuel and bioenergy systems are integral to most climate stabilization scenarios for displacement of transport sector fossil fuel use and for producing negative emissions via carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, the net greenhouse gas mitigation benefit of such pathways is controversial due to concerns around ecosystem carbon losses from land use change and foregone sequestration benefits from alternative land uses. Here, we couple bottom-up ecosystem simulation with models of cellulosic biofuel production and CCS in order to track ecosystem and supply chain carbon flows for current and future biofuel systems, with comparison to competing land-based biological mitigation schemes. Analyzing three contrasting US case study sites, we show that on land transitioning out of crops or pasture, switchgrass cultivation for cellulosic ethanol production has per-hectare mitigation potential comparable to reforestation and severalfold greater than grassland restoration. In contrast, harvesting and converting existing secondary forest at those sites incurs large initial carbon debt requiring long payback periods. We also highlight how plausible future improvements in energy crop yields and biorefining technology together with CCS would achieve mitigation potential 4 and 15 times greater than forest and grassland restoration, respectively. Finally, we show that recent estimates of induced land use change are small relative to the opportunities for improving system performance that we quantify here. While climate and other ecosystem service benefits cannot be taken for granted from cellulosic biofuel deployment, our scenarios illustrate how conventional and carbon-negative biofuel systems could make a near-term, robust, and distinctive contribution to the climate challenge.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "20c0cb9ba76c8c79438506fa407ccc707cac0733", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1963779029", "DOI": "10.1007/s10666-011-9283-1", "CorpusId": 17881288}, "title": "The Impact of Uncertainty in Climate Targets and CO2 Storage Availability on Long-Term Emissions Abatement", "abstract": "A major characteristic of our global interactive climate-energy system is the large uncertainty that exists with respect to both future environmental requirements and the means available for fulfilling these.

Uncertainties exist, however, concerning the large-scale implementability of this technology, such as related to the regional availability of storage sites for the captured CO2. We analyze these uncertainties from an integrated assessment perspective by using the bottom-up model TIAM-ECN and by studying a set of scenarios that cover a range of different climate targets and technology futures. Our study consists of two main approaches: (1) a sensitivity analysis through the investigation of a number of scenarios under perfect foresight decision making and (2) a stochastic programming exercise that allows for simultaneously considering a set of potential future states-of-the-world. We find that, if a stringent climate (forcing) target is a possibility, it dominates the solution: if deep CO2 emission reductions are not started as soon as possible, the target may become unreachable.

Mineral carbonation (MC) is emerging as a potential CCS technology solution to sequester CO2 from smaller/medium emitters, where geological sequestration is not a viable option. In MC processes, CO2 is chemically reacted with calcium- and/or magnesium-containing materials to form stable carbonates. This work investigates the current advancement in the proposed MC technologies and the role they can play in decreasing the overall cost of this CO2 sequestration route. In situ mineral carbonation is a very promising option in terms of resources available and enhanced security, but the technology is still in its infancy and transport and storage costs are still higher than geological storage in sedimentary basins ($17 instead of $8 per tCO2). Ex situ mineral carbonation has been demonstrated on pilot and demonstration scales. However, its application is currently limited by its high costs, which range from $50 to $300 per tCO2 sequestered. Energy use, the reaction rate and material handling are the key factors hindering the success of this technology. The value of the products seems central to render MC economically viable in the same way as conventional CCS seems profitable only when combined with EOR.

The resultant carbonate is transferred from sodium ions to calcium ions via causticization. The captured CO2 is released from the calcium carbonate through thermal calcination in a modified kiln. The energy consumption is calculated as 350 kJ/mol of CO2 captured. It is dominated by the thermal energy demand of the kiln and the mechanical power required for air movement. The low concentration of CO2 in air requires a throughput of 3 million cubic meters of air per ton of CO2 removed, which could result in significant water losses. Electricity consumption in the process results in CO2 emissions and the use of coal power would significantly reduce to net amount captured. The thermodynamic efficiency of this process is low but comparable to other \"end of pipe\" capture technologies.

We show that steady buoyancy dominated flows in complex geometries can be modeled as a cascade of flux partitioning events.

Post-combustion capture offers some advantages as existing combustion technologies can still be used without radical changes on them. This makes postcombustion capture easier to implement as a retrofit option (to existing power plants) compared to the other two approaches. Therefore, post-combustion capture is probably the first technology that will be deployed.

Here we show that additional land-use change to meet a 1.5\u2009\u00b0C climate change target could result in net losses of carbon from the land. The effectiveness of BECCS strongly depends on several assumptions related to the choice of biomass, the fate of initial above ground biomass, and the fossil-fuel emissions offset in the energy system. Depending on these factors, carbon removed from the atmosphere through BECCS could easily be offset by losses due to land-use change. If BECCS involves replacing high-carbon content ecosystems with crops, then forest-based mitigation could be more efficient for atmospheric CO2 removal than BECCS.Land-based mitigation for meeting the Paris climate target must consider the carbon cycle impacts of land-use change.

The total quantity of CO2 removed from the atmosphere over the project lifetime and the carbon breakeven time were observed to be highly case specific. This has profound implications for the policy frameworks required to incentivise and regulate the widespread deployment of BECCS technology. The results of a sensitivity analysis on the model combined with the investigation of alternate supply chain scenarios elucidated key levers to improve the sustainability of BECCS: (1) measuring and limiting the impacts of direct and indirect land use change, (2) using carbon neutral power and organic fertilizer, (3) minimising biomass transport, and prioritising sea over road transport, (4) maximising the use of carbon negative fuels, and (5) exploiting alternative biomass processing options, e.g., natural drying or torrefaction.

However, currently their costs are estimated to be very high, NETs do not seem to offer co-benefits besides mitigating climate change and there are significant concerns regarding possible negative impacts of their large-scale implementation on sustainable development. Costs can vary significantly due to locational factors such as availability of biomass resources and geological storage capacity. It will be up to progressive industrialized countries to take first steps to mobilize the mitigation potential of NETs. In order to understand whether NETs can provide a significant contribution to mitigation, financial incentives are needed that allow implementing the most attractive NET activities at the global scale. We see the market mechanism under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement \u2013 colloquially called \u2018Sustainable Development Mechanism\u2019 \u2013 as a possible cornerstone of such a policy instrument. While initially NETs will not be competitive on the free market, the mechanism can facilitate bilateral financial transfers for NETs, where mitigation units accrue to the financier. We discuss the functions and design elements that an international policy instrument may need to fulfil to successfully mobilize NETs. This includes in particular robust quantification of removed carbon under international oversight and preventing social and environmental conflicts particularly on land and water use by NETs to ensure long-term acceptability. Key policy insights International policy instruments that mobilize negative emissions technologies are inexistent despite most mitigation pathways relying on large-scale NETs implementation later this century. Feasibility of NETs at large-scale is highly uncertain due to high expected costs and political economy challenges. Practical experience is necessary for better understanding feasibility. For cost-effective global deployment of NETs, a policy instrument would need to mobilize international financial flows and implement safeguards concerning sustainable development impacts.

Achievable temperature targets rise by up to \u223c0.4\u2009\u00b0 C if the implementation of comprehensive climate policies is delayed by another 15 years, chiefly because of transitional economic impacts.

At the highest level, the technology strategy articulated in all the scenarios in EMF27 includes three elements: decarbonization of energy supply, increasing the use of low-carbon energy carriers in end-use, and reduction of energy use. The way that the scenarios differ is in the degree to which these different elements of strategy are implemented, the timing of those implementations, and the associated macroeconomic costs. The study also discusses the value of individual technologies for achieving climate stabilization. A robust finding is that the unavailability of carbon capture and storage and limited availability of bioenergy have the largest impact on feasibility and macroeconomic costs for stabilizing atmospheric concentrations at low levels, mostly because of their combined ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere.

However, the mathematical language and tools to identify materials with similar pore structures, but different composition, has been lacking. We develop a pore recognition approach to quantify similarity of pore structures and classify them using topological data analysis. This allows us to identify materials with similar pore geometries, and to screen for materials that are similar to given top-performing structures.

More recently, the potential to integrate carbon capture and storage technologies (\u201cCCS\u201d)\u2014 conceived to enable fossil fuel use without atmospheric CO2 emissions\u2014with bio-energy systems has emerged as a means to capture atmospheric carbon, fixed through photosynthesis, and sequester it from the atmosphere for geologic timescales (Obersteiner et al. 2001; Yamashita and Barreto 2004; Mollersten et al. 2003; Rhodes and Keith 2005). The ability of such integrated systems to produce energy products with negative net atmospheric carbon emissions could have important implications for mitigating anthropogenic climate change. The scale and timing of biomass-based mitigation is limited by the availability and cost of conversion technologies, many of which are currently inefficient or technologically immature. More fundamentally, it is limited by feasible scales of biomass production, estimates of which are highly uncertain and indicate that the capacities envisioned within aggressive proposals, including those by Read (2008), may not be achievable (Hoogwijk et al. 2003; Berndes et al. 2003). Concern for environmental, social, and economic impacts of biomass development may further constrain production below technically feasible levels. The current biofuels boom may be illustrative in this context. On the one hand, it demonstrates the feasibility of rapid, large-scale bio-energy deployments; while on the other hand, it provides examples of undesirable environmental and social consequences from large-scale biomass production (Ziegler 2007; Rosenthal 2007a, b).

The parasitic reactions of electrolyte and carbon electrode induced by the high charging potential cause the decay of capacity and limit the battery life. Here, a K-O(2) battery is report that uses K(+) ions to capture O(2)(-) to form the thermodynamically stable KO(2) product. This allows for the battery to operate through the one-electron redox process of O(2)/O(2)(-). Our studies confirm the formation and removal of KO(2) in the battery cycle test.

This culture produced acetate at a concentration of 1.29 \u00b1 0.15 g L(-1) (maximum up to 1.5 g L(-1); 25 mM) from CO2 at a fixed current of -5 Am(-2) in fed-batch bioelectrochemical reactors at high N2:CO2 flow rates.
