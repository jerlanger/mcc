The scope would be the mitigation of greenhouse effects and the reduction of related global warming and climate changes. A large number of papers have been devoted to this topic, Some recent publications, also in this series, has been devoted to the risk assessment of CO2 relief (Vianello et al. 2012) and overall risk analysis of CO2 transportation (Samadi et al. 2012). It is not the aim of this paper to discuss the effectiveness of the technology but to only focus on the transportation of CO2 from production points to the storage location. The only feasible way of performing this task is the use of pipelines of high-capacity. Though carbon dioxide is not very poisonous, however its relief in large quantities combined with its density higher than air could fill populated regions with large dangerous effects. This paper analyses the thermodynamic methods required for a reliable simulation of steady state as the initial requirement for the subsequent calculation of relief conditions (flow rate, pressure and temperature) as a preliminary critical step to the calculation the dispersion effects.

These projects are usually carried out by means of commercially available process simulators (HYSYS, AspenPlus, ChemCad, etc.) and fluid-dynamics simulators (OLGA, LedaFlow, etc.).

The need to adapt to international agreements, expected increase of CO 2 emissions, limited technological capabilities to reduce emissions, the energy intensity of industry and geological conditions allowing underground storage make carbon capture and storage (CCS) a viable option to reduce CO 2 emissions. The implementation of CCS on a commercial scale depends on many factors, including the development of capture technology, transport options, and the geological structure. Its applicability is highly dependent on the regulations and economic, energy, and environmental policy. At the current stage of work, the biggest problems in the implementation of CCS include legal regulations, social acceptance, and cost reduction. The numerous political and economic benefits may balance the costs of CCS technology implementation. The captured CO 2 can be used in the exploitation of oil fields and in large\u2010scale industrial processes.

Depleted oil and gas reservoirs have been studied for potential storage sites but also saline aquifers that have the advantages of much larger pore volume. In this latter case, injection of large volume of anhydrous carbon dioxide will lead to a strong water desaturation of the near wellbore region because of evaporation mechanisms. Even the capillary trapped water can be removed by thermodynamical transfer of water vapor in the CO2 phase. The extension in time and space of the dry zone will be controlled by the drying rate induced by the gas flow. Consequences of drying may induce alteration of the injectivity by salt precipitation and/or alteration of the rock fabric itself, especially for shaly sandstones in the case of clay drying. The context of CCS has raised new interests in the understanding of drying kinetic where the water vapor is evacuated by gas convection. In this study, we investigated experimentally the drying rate evolution with time on a shaly sandstone sample in two conditions of drying: convective and diffusive. In convective conditions, air is injected at different flow rates through the porous media in conditions of drying representative of a CO2 injection site at one million ton per year. In diffusive conditions, no flow is imposed and the water vapor escape by diffusion. Drying rates dynamics in both conditions were measured by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and compared. We varied the temperature and the salinity in diffusive-driven drying and the gas flow rate in convective-driven drying. The water distribution in the pore network and the water saturation profiles were monitored continuously using T2 relaxation and 1D imaging NMR techniques. For the range of temperature and air flow rate used, we show that drying rates in the two drying conditions are similar but not identical. They both present different periods characteristic of the main mechanisms for water mass transfer. Drying rate has a power law dependence on the temperature, as predicted by thermodynamic, and drying rate was found proportional to the flow rate in convective drying.

The path toward achieving those deep decarbonization targets can take various shapes but will surely include a portfolio of economy-wide low-carbon energy technologies/options. The growth of the intermittent renewable power sources in the grid mix has helped reduce the carbon footprint of the electric power sector. Under the need for decarbonizing the electric power sector, we simulated a low-carbon power system. We investigated the role of hydrogen for future electric power systems under current cost projections. The model optimizes the power generation mix economically for a given carbon constraint. The generation mix consists of intermittent renewable power sources (solar and wind) and dispatchable gas turbine and combined cycle units fueled by natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration, as well as hydrogen. We created several scenarios with battery storage options, pumped hydro, hydrogen storage, and demand-side response (DSR). The results show that energy storage replaces power generation, and pumped hydro entirely replaces battery storage under given conditions. The availability of pumped hydro storage and demand-side response reduced the total cost as well as the combination of solar photovoltaic and pumped hydro storage. Demand-side response reduces relatively costly dispatchable power generation, reduces annual power generation, halves the shadow carbon price, and is a viable alternative to energy storage. The carbon constrain defines the generation mix and initializes the integration of hydrogen (H2). Although the model rates power to gas with hydrogen as not economically viable in this power system under the given conditions and assumptions, hydrogen is important for hard-to-abate sectors and enables sector coupling in a real energy system.

While previous proposals focus on governmental compensation, the aim of this work is to set BECCS into the supply chain of a wide array of consumer products and thereby find alternative or complementary, business-driven, ways to incentivise BECCS when applied to the pulp and paper industry. In this work, we assess a \u201cvalue proposition\u201d for low-carbon products in supply chains linked to the pulp and paper industry. By projecting the costs and negative emissions related to BECCS from the pulp mill to typical consumer products, as exemplified by three case study products, we show how BECCS can substantially reduce the carbon footprint of the consumer products, while only marginally increasing their cost. Additional price premiums could shorten the payback period of the initial investment in BECCS. The developed business case presents how actors along the supply chain for pulp and paper products can collectively contribute to securing financing and to mitigating investment risks. The results challenge the private sector, i.e., the companies along the pulp-and-paper supply chain to commit considerable investments also in the case without or with too weak direct political incentives.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is regarded as a key technology for the reduction of CO2 emissions from power plants and other sources at the European and international level. The EU will hence support a selected portfolio of demonstration projects to promote, at industrial scale, the implementation of CCS in Europe. Several of these projects aim to store CO2 below the seabed. However, little is known about the short-term and long-term impacts of CO2 storage on marine ecosystems even though CO2 has been stored sub-seabed in the North Sea (Sleipner) for over 13 years and for one year in the Barents Sea (Sn\u00f8hvit). Against this background, the proposed ECO2 project will assess the likelihood of leakage and impact of leakage on marine ecosystems. In order to do so ECO2 will study a sub-seabed storage site in operation since 1996 (Sleipner, 90 m water depth), a recently opened site (Sn\u00f8hvit, 2008, 330 m water depth), and a potential storage site located in the Polish sector of the Baltic Sea (B3 field site, 80 m water depth) covering the major geological settings to be used for the storage of CO2. Novel monitoring techniques will be applied to detect and quantify the fluxes of formation fluids, natural gas, and CO2 from storage sites and to develop appropriate and effective monitoring strategies. Field work at storage sites will be supported by modelling and laboratory experiments and complemented by process and monitoring studies at natural CO2 seeps that serve as analogues for potential CO2 leaks at storage sites. ECO2 will also investigate the perception of marine CCS in the public and develop effective means to disseminate the project results to stakeholders and policymakers. Finally, a best practice guide for the management of sub-seabed CO2 storage sites will be developed applying the precautionary principle and valuing the costs for monitoring and remediation.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "14305b59a8f8da2cf7c363f150102c3137fe386d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2496165723", "CorpusId": 132553059}, "title": "Progress on Carbon Capture and Storage in the UK", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "a26c89859df791a2d72f688fd441ac30985a772e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3088118667", "DOI": "10.1007/s13762-020-02936-1", "CorpusId": 221883798}, "title": "Evaluation of reducing CO2 emissions as important greenhouse gas and maximum oil recovery: optimization of two processes", "abstract": "The oil and gas sources as fossil fuels have high wealth in the entire world.

DOE alone is currently investing >20M$/yr on research of such sequestration technologies. We propose an alternate, geochemistry-based capture and sequestration method which hydrates the CO2 contained in power plant flue gas with water to produce a carbonic acid solution. This in turn is reacted on-site with carbonate mineral (e.g., limestone) to convert the original CO2 gas to bicarbonate in solution (Rau and Caldeira, 1999; Caldeira and Rau, 2000). This dissolved bicarbonate is then released and diluted in the ocean where it would add minimally to the large, benign pool of these ions already present in seawater. Such a process is geochemically equivalent to carbonate weathering which will otherwise naturally consume anthropogenic CO2, but over many millennia (Archer et al., 1997; Murray and Wilson, 1997).

CCS lacks the green appeal of renewable sources of power, and disbelief is an all too common response of laypeople when told that billions of tons of CO2 can be stored underground for centuries. Yet its low (relative) cost and enormous capacity to mitigate CO2 emissions have attracted a broad range of prominent stakeholders, who assert that avoiding climate change will be impossible without CCS. The legal debate over CCS mirrors these fault lines. The issues of greatest concern have centered on the risks of CO2 leakage and the merits of long-term liability. These fears reflect misapprehensions about the nature of the risks involved and a neglect of operational factors that simplify application of tort liability. Put in perspective, we show that the risks are remarkably small given the huge volumes of CO2 involved. We conclude that common law liability is likely to play a modest role in promoting safe geologic sequestration of CO2. The combination of risks with different temporal profiles will limit the deterrence value of liability, and long-term liability in particular will have only a nominal effect.

Our nature will continue to develop and evolve under these conditions, but the drastic climate change, global warming, and the mutation of flora and fauna are tasks that require immediate solutions. As a solution to these problems, we can offer the use of alternative energy sources. They represent promising ways to obtain, transfer and use energy from renewable sources, reducing the risk of harm to the environment. Also, to reduce harmful CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, methods for reducing greenhouse gas emissions are proposed, including carbon dioxide sequestration technologies, which are implemented in the form of CC (U) S (carbon capture, utilization and storage) projects. Another solution to the tasks set can be the creation of carbon landfills and farms that will allow us to develop technologies for monitoring carbon emissions and runoff.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "540e1892fef219d5f2d091811ad43478f61437c0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2056173832", "DOI": "10.1002/AIC.12085", "CorpusId": 98369436}, "title": "DataNet: An emerging cyberinfrastructure for sharing, reusing and preserving digital data for scientific discovery and learning", "abstract": "D ataNet is an emerging, enabling cyberinfrastructure for open access, and long-term preservation of digital data funded by the National Science Foundation.

This will foster transformative, interdisciplinary scientific collaboration on a grand scale, permit scientists to build knowledge that will provide better understanding of and sustainable solutions to important scientific challenges, offer better public understanding of technological problems through openly accessible information in well articulated repositories, and provide a format for resolving the data-driven nature of scientific and technological problems of societal importance (i.e., grand challenge and other problems). This perspective article presents an overview of the DataNet initiative and its vision, and outlines various opportunities that DataNet will afford science and engineering. Opportunities specifically available to chemical engineers include the possibility of (1) sharing data with scientists and engineers from other disciplines on technical challenges ranging from molecular modeling to carbon capture/storage to energy and biofuels production, and others, (2) initiating new collaborations on \u2018\u2018big\u2019\u2019 science or grand challenges, (3) depositing and preserving data for research and education in secure and protected national repositories, (4) getting involved in various cyberinfrastructure activities, (5) receiving credit for sharing data by publishing that data in a peer-reviewed manner, (6) enhancing grantsmanship, and (7) more. Many branches of science and engineering are becoming increasingly data driven. For example, the second generation of the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system (Pan-Starrs), called PS4, is an effort for continuously scanning the entire sky for the purpose of scientific discovery and for monitoring near earth objects.

In this paper a series of experiments is presented, demonstrating the behaviour of CO2 quenched premixed swirl flames on an optical burner, followed by a small scale (50-80kWe) CHP gas turbine with CO2 injection at the air inlet. Burner results demonstrated the effect of the CO2 as a combustion inhibitor, causing downstream migration of the premixed flame zone, leading to eventual blow-off, instability and extinction, and necessitating a change in operation equivalence ratio. The influence that CO2 has on produced CO and NOx emission profiles is also presented, as functions of operational flame temperature.

Interest in the development of methods to reduce greenhouse gases has increased enormously. In order to control such emissions, many advanced technologies have been developed, which help in reducing energy consumption, increasing the efficiency of energy conversion or utilization, switching to lower carbon-content fuels, enhancing natural sinks for carbon dioxide, capture and storage of carbon dioxide, reducing the use of fossil fuels in order to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide and minimizing the levels of pollutants. In the last few years, research on renewable energy sources that reduce carbon dioxide emissions has become very important. Since the 1980s, bioethanol has been recognized as a potential alternative to petroleum-derived transport fuels in many countries. Today, bioethanol accounts for more than 94% of global biofuel production, with North America (mainly the US) and Brazil as the overall leading producers in the world (about 88% of the world bioethanol production in 2009). Generally, biofuel production can be classified into three main types, depending on the converted feedstocks used: biofuel production of first, second and third generation. Bioethanol production of the first generation is either from starchy feedstocks, e.g. seeds or grains such as wheat, barley and corn (North America, Europe) or from sucrose-containing feedstocks (mainly Brazil). The feedstocks used for bioethanol production of the second generation are lignocellulose-containing raw materials like straw or wood as a carbon source. Biofuel production of the third generation is understood as the production of lipolytic compounds mainly from algae. The feedstocks of bioethanol production of the first generation could also enter the animal or human food chain. Therefore, bioethanol production of the first generation is regarded critically by the global population, worrying about food shortages and price rises. Other reasons which lead to research and developments in bioethanol production of the second generation are: a shortage of world oil reserves, increasing fuel prices and reduction of the greenhouse effect.

CO2 selective membranes are commercially available and membrane processes for natural gas sweetening have been proven. The majority of CCS will be implemented on post-combustion scenarios, which is carbon capture from low pressure flue gas. This presents unique challenges to gas separation membranes, requiring process design strategies that generate a pressure ratio across the membrane for efficient separation, while minimising the energy duty of the process to ensure the economics are competitive. This chapter reports on design strategies for gas separation membranes that enable membranes to undertake post-combustion capture from flue gas, and investigates their economic competitiveness. Processes based on membranes only, such as membrane cascades with recycle, have been demonstrated to be uncompetitive for post-combustion capture compared to alternative technologies. However, the design features developed in these processes to generate the membrane pressure ratio are important for low pressure applications. Hybrid processes combining membrane gas separation with another separation technology have been simulated to be economically competitive, depending on the application. Importantly, membrane gas separation with cryogenic separation is a viable process design. This is because of the membrane stage\u2019s ability to exclude the majority of nitrogen from the cryogenic separation, reducing its energy duty. The ability to recycle CO2 through a combustion burner, and hence increase the flue gas CO2 partial pressure, is a design feature that significantly reduces the cost of capture for flue gas emitted from coal-fired power stations. For many CCS applications, developments in membrane process designs are as important as developments in the membrane\u2019s CO2 permeability and selectivity, since the economics of many of these processes are dependent on the gas processing equipment rather than the membrane. Hence, membrane process designs and strategies developed to minimise the energy duty are vital for gas separation membranes in the CCS field.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "cedb0ca1c25ee7e9d074ed8886db14f5d0a2316b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1275862828", "CorpusId": 152835015}, "title": "Energy Policy in the U.S.: Politics, Challenges, and Prospects for Change", "abstract": "Introduction What Is Energy?

It involves capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from large point sources such as power plants, prior to compressing, transporting, and storing it securely in geological formations. The CO2 emitted is thus prevented from entering the atmosphere. CCS is believed, by many, to have massive potential to significantly reduce GHG emissions, with the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggesting that CCS could contribute between 10 and 55 per cent of the world's total carbon mitigation effort until 2100. This article considers the principal impediments to the development of CCS projects and the steps taken in the European Union (EU) to overcome them. The development of CCS requires not only the establishment of adequate funding mechanisms and, most likely, the existence of consistently higher carbon prices than those prevail today, but also the settlement of a number of key legal issues. Although much further work is required on the part of legislators, a regulatory framework for CCS is slowly growing in various jurisdictions, especially in the EU where a large step forward was taken in December 2008 with the passing of a CCS Directive.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "7b67c5e9d617c78a253d6304863d5392bc8ad780", "externalIds": {"MAG": "318301392", "CorpusId": 42071543}, "title": "Cost-effective fuel and technology choices in the transportation sector in a future carbon constrained world: results from the Global Energy Transition (GET) model", "abstract": "This thesis analyzes future fuel and technology choices focusing on transport in a carbon constrained world. The analysis tool used in all five appended papers is the cost-minimizing Global Energy Transition (GET) model. Paper I analyzes cost-effective fuel and technology choices for passenger vehicles under a variety of vehicle cost-assumptions and how these choices depend on technology paths in the electricity sector. We find that cost estimates as well as the availability of carbon capture and storage technology and concentrating solar power have a substantial impact, ranging from a dominance of hydrogen to a dominance of electricity. Paper II analyzes the cost-effectiveness of biofuels for transportation, assuming that industrialized regions start reducing their CO2 emissions some decades ahead of developing regions. We find that biofuels may play a more important role for transportation in industrialized regions if these regions assume their responsibilities and reduce emissions before developing regions start reducing theirs, compared to the case in which all countries take action under a global cap and trade emissions reduction regime. Paper III analyzes how policy instruments aimed at increasing the use of biofuels for transportation in industrialized regions affect CO2 emissions in industrialized and developing regions. We find that such policy instruments may lead to avoided emissions in industrialized regions, especially during the first 50 years, and in a few specific cases in the developing regions, too. However, in the majority of cases, such a biofuels policy leads to increased emissions in the developing regions, i.e., to \u201ccarbon leakage.\u201d Paper IV analyzes why two global energy systems models reach different results on the cost-effectiveness of biofuels, although the models have strong similarities. We find biomass most cost-effectively used for heat production at low CO2 taxes in both models. Biomass allocation at higher CO2 taxes may depend on whether CO2-neutral hydrogen and/or electricity are assumed available for the transportation sector at sufficiently low cost. Paper V investigates prices and costs in the GET model, and how these change over time, to get a deeper understanding of why biofuels generally are not a cost-effective transportation fuel choice in the model. We compare the total cost per km for each fuel choice, based on the primary energy prices and carbon tax generated by the model. We find that the required carbon tax level for biofuels to become cost-effective, compared to fossil-based fuels, is a \u201cmoving target.\u201d The required tax level increases with an increase in carbon taxes, since the latter increases the price of biomass energy in the model.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "fb12149aba17ecc0c656b8f6669e65c87b14316b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2948757020", "CorpusId": 195582120}, "title": "CCSP Carbon Capture and Storage Program: Mid-term report 2011-2013", "abstract": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is considered to be one of the main options for reducing global CO2 emissions. However, the development of CCS technology faces many challenges. CO2 capture is still very energy intensive and development is needed to bring costs down. Also, CO2 needs to be transported to a suitable storage site for secure and permanent storage. Although CCS technology has not yet been implemented at a full-scale power plant, several demonstration projects are underway in the world. The report gives an overview of the work carried out in the Carbon Capture and Storage Program (CCSP) R&D program during 2011\u20132013. The R&D program is coordinated by CLEEN Ltd. with funding from Tekes \u2013 the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation. The objective for CCSP is to develop CCS-related technologies and concepts, leading to essential pilots and demonstrations by the end of the program. A further objective is to create a strong scientific basis for the development of CCS technology, concepts and frameworks, and to establish active, international CCS co-operation. The program consortium consists of 9 research organisations and 17 industrial partners, with an annual budget of about 3 million euro per year. For Finland, CCS offers significant opportunities, which are being investigated and developed in CCSP. Being a large consumer of power and heat, Finland has a unique opportunity in integrating CCS with combined heat and power (CHP) plants. As Finland is a large consumer of biomass, adding CCS to bioenergy solutions (bioCCS) would enable removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. For heavy industry, such as oil refining and steel manufacturing, CCS is the only technology that can significantly reduce CO2 emissions. For the Finnish technology developers and providers CCS could provide a significant market share in the future, such as in the area of oxy-fuel combustion and chemical looping combustion, which are being further developed in CCSP. Monitoring technologies is another quickly developing area where a growing Finnish expertise can help making CCS a safe and secure emission reduction and improve the social acceptance of CCS. As the Finnish bedrock does not have any formations suitable for underground storage of CO2, other options are being investigated. A recent survey of the Baltic Sea area shows a potential for geological storage of CO2. Several options for using CO2 as a raw material for production of inorganic carbonates, chemicals and fuel components also show promise.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "a6669f9332984582c6c4f41908cd9fe5252b6dfe", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2617169795", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.2982871", "CorpusId": 133884260}, "title": "Green Growth Opportunities for Asia", "abstract": "This paper assesses the low-carbon economy in Asia: how large it is today and how well it will fare in the future.

When carbon is removed from forests through harvest, a portion of the harvested carbon is stored in wood products, often for many decades. The United States Forest Service (USFS) and other agencies are interested in accurately accounting for carbon flux associated with harvested wood products (HWP) to meet greenhouse gas monitoring commitments and climate change adaptation and mitigation objectives. National-level forest carbon accounting has been in place for over a decade, but there is an increasing need for accounting at the scale of smaller administrative units, including USFS Regions and individual national forests. This paper uses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) production accounting approach and the California Forest Project Protocol (CFPP) to estimate HWP carbon storage from 1906 to 2010 for the USFS Northern Region and its eleven national forests, which span northern Idaho, Montana, South Dakota, and eastern Washington. For the Northern Region as a whole, carbon stocks in the HWP pool were increasing at one million megagrams of carbon (MgC) per year in the mid-1960s, with peak cumulative storage of 28 million MgC occurring in 1995. Net positive flux into the HWP pool over this period is primarily attributable to high harvest levels in the middle of the twentieth century. Harvest levels declined after 1970, resulting in less carbon entering the HWP pool. Since 1995, emissions from HWP at solid waste disposal sites have exceeded additions from harvesting, resulting in a decline in the total amount of carbon stored in the HWP pool. The Northern Region HWP pool is now in a period of negative net annual stock change because the decay of products harvested between 1906 and 2010 exceeds additions of carbon to the HWP pool through harvest. Though most individual national forests mirror Regional-level trends in harvest and carbon flux, the timing and magnitude of change differs among forests with some forests departing notably from Regional trends. Together with estimates of ecosystem carbon, Regional and Forest-level estimates of HWP carbon flux can be used to inform management decisions and guide climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts by the agency. Though our emphasis is on national forests in the Northern Region, we provide a framework by which these accounting methods can be applied more broadly at sub-national scales to other regions, land management units, and firms.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "de9b43b3a5604ac3ce568409a415f5a1f7b3877b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "172298355", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-642-02856-4_8", "CorpusId": 127575421}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)", "abstract": "Worldwide anthropogenic CO2 emissions were around 26,Gt CO2/year in the year 2005.

The use of DBH-based allometric equations to estimate the carbon stored over larger areas therefore, assumes that tree architecture, including branching and crown structures, are consistent for a given DBH, and that minor variations cancel out at the plot scale. We aimed to explore the degree of structural variation present at the individual tree level across a range of size-classes. We used terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to measure the 3D structure of each tree in a 1 ha savanna plot, with coincident field-inventory. We found that stem reconstructions from TLS captured both the spatial distribution pattern and the DBH of individual trees with high confidence when compared with manual measurements (R2 = 0.98, RMSE = 0.0102 m). Our exploration of the relationship between DBH, crown size and tree height revealed significant variability in savanna tree crown structure (measured as crown area). These findings question the reliability of DBH-based allometric equations for adequately representing diversity in tree architecture, and therefore carbon storage, in tropical savannas. However, adoption of TLS outside environmental research has been slow due to considerable capital cost and monitoring programs often continue to rely on sub-plot monitoring and traditional allometric equations.

We discuss the potential benefits of alternative TLS-based approaches, such as explicit modelling of tree structure or voxel-based analyses, to capture the diverse 3D structures of savanna trees.

By taking this view of the C4 plant, we will describe photosynthetic metabolism in C4 leaf cells as a cooperative activity between the mesophyll cells, which trap atmospheric CO2 as readily transportable (but nevertheless reactive) four-carbon acids, and the bundle sheath cells, which decarboxylate the acids and refix the CO2 via the C3 cycle.

Therefore, this study provides a broad comparison of energy technologies based on the objective expression of accident risks for complete energy chains. For fossil chains and hydropower the extensive historical experience available in PSI's Energy-related Severe Accident Database (ENSAD) is used, whereas for nuclear a simplified probabilistic safety assessment (PSA) is applied, and evaluations of new renewables are based on a combination of available data, modeling, and expert judgment. Generally, OECD and EU 27 countries perform better than non-OECD. Fatality rates are lowest for Western hydropower and nuclear as well as for new renewables. In contrast, maximum consequences can be by far highest for nuclear and hydro, intermediate for fossil, and very small for new renewables, which are less prone to severe accidents. Centralized, low-carbon technology options could generally contribute to achieve large reductions in CO2-emissions; however, the principal challenge for both fossil with Carbon Capture and Storage and nuclear is public acceptance. Although, external costs of severe accidents are significantly smaller than those caused by air pollution, accidents can have disastrous and long-term impacts.

Although demonstration of full scale integrated CCS systems in various locations globally is already taking place, there are still significant technical, economic, political and financial barriers and uncertainties about CCS. A great challenge for the stakeholders is that the number of barriers and uncertainties for the full scale deployment of CCS is too high. The aim of this thesis therefore, is to identify the barriers and uncertainties related to the full scale deployment of CCS, present how do different stakeholders assess the barriers and how these barriers and uncertainties identified can be overcome. The methodology chosen for the assessment of the barriers and uncertainties is the Multi-Criteria Assessment (MCA), in which three scenarios are created, a short-term, a medium-term and a long-term, against which the barriers and uncertainties will be assessed. Eight experts from the governmental, scientific, business and environmental sector were interviewed, which although small, still an indicative sample. This thesis results in that the most important barriers and uncertainties for the full scale deployment of CCS are the economic and financial viability, the insufficient CO2 price, the need for stronger incentive mechanisms, the public acceptance, the lack of robust-transparent legal framework and the renewable energy competition. The process of interviewing experts also interestingly revealed that apart from the barriers identified in the literature review from existing social science literature, there are additional barriers to consider and assess for the deployment of CCS in further research. The additional barriers are the political urgency of climate change, the willingness to pay more for our energy supplies, the lack of infrastructure, the efficiency in CO2 capturing process, the unawareness of the climate change by the public, the lack of a global framework and the differences in views between different stakeholders. The assessment process by the experts interviewed reveals that there are significant differences between different stakeholders on how they perceive and score the barriers for the full scale deployment of CCS. The most significant differences are met in carbon lock-in and dependency on fossil fuel. Regarding on how to overcome the barriers and uncertainties for the full-scale deployment of CCS, the political willingness, the collaboration between governments, business sector, scientists and society and the awareness of climate change are met to be crucial.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "6048c1497298bd642abadaa5ad542ab1d2b3aacf", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148683", "CorpusId": 235791143, "PubMed": "34246146"}, "title": "Application of real options in carbon capture and storage literature: Valuation techniques and research hotspots.", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "ca3f4c22bf1921021ce1601df9b584320fac34d6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2225069730", "CorpusId": 130259794}, "title": "Climate Change Mitigation Approach Through Plantation Forestry in India", "abstract": "Few global issues have received more attention than climate change in recent years.

Black liquor gasification (BLG) is currently being developed as an alternative technology for energy and chemical recovery in kraft pulp and paper mills. The technology enables the mill to increase the internal electricity generation or produce chemicals such as motor fuels. This thesis investigates the influence of different factors, including choice of product, type of mill, alternative investments, opportunities for carbon capture and storage (CCS) and future energy market conditions, on the economic performance and CO2 emission balances for BLG-based biorefinery concepts. \n \nImplementation of biorefinery concepts such as BLG with electricity production in future market pulp mills can be achieved without making the mill dependent on external wood fuel. However, implementation in integrated pulp and paper mills requires external wood fuel and reduces the amount of wood fuel available for other applications, thereby increasing the CO2 emissions from those applications. \n \nThe results show that BLG with motor fuel production could be profitable for both market and integrated mills, whereas BLG with electricity generation is primarily an attractive option for market mills. For mills that operate with conventional recovery boiler technology, potentially profitable biorefinery concepts include lignin extraction or motor fuel production from gasified wood fuel. Few of the biorefinery concepts investigated in this work achieve a significant reduction of CO2 emissions, especially for integrated mills. However, if commercially available, CCS could contribute to significant CO2 emissions reduction and enhanced profitability for future energy market conditions characterized by a high CO2 emissions charge, for both combustion- and gasification-based biorefinery concepts. Steam-saving measures could also significantly improve the economic performance as well as the CO2 emission balances, especially for biorefinery concepts that use external wood fuel.

However, public perception concerning CO2 storage in the geosphere is generally negative, being particularly motivated by perceived leakage risks. Therefore, a main issue when attempting to gain public acceptance is ensuring provision of appropriate monitoring practices, aimed at providing health, safety and environmental risk assessment, so that potential risks from CO2 storage are minimized. Naturally occurring CO2 deposits provide unique natural analogues for evaluating and validating methods used for the detection and monitoring of CO2 spreading and degassing into the atmosphere. Geological and hydrological structures of the Cheb Basin (NW Bohemia, Czech Republic) represent such a natural ana- logue for investigating CO2 leakage and offer a perfect location at which to verify monitoring tools used for direct investigation of processes along preferential migration paths. This shallow basin dating from the Tertiary age is characterized by up to 300 m thick Neo- gene sediment deposits and several tectonically active faults. The objectives of this paper are to introduce the CO2 analogues concept to present the Eger Rift as a suitable location for a natural CO2 analogue site and to demonstrate to what extent such an analogue site should be used (with a case study). The case study presents the results obtained from a joint application of geoelectrical measurements in combination with soil CO2 concentra- tion and flux determination methods, for the detection and characterization of natural CO2 releases at gas seeps (as part of a hierarchic monitoring concept). To highlight discharge-controlling structural near surface features was the initial motivation for the application of geoelectrical measurements. Soil-gas concentration and flux measure- ment techniques are relatively simple to employ and are valuable methods that can be used to monitor seeping CO2 along preferential pathways.

Consequently, negative emissions technologies (NETs) have come to the forefront of mitigation discussions. NETs must however overcome challenges if they are to be realised at scale. Uncertainties around the large-scale biomass supply have fuelled a debate on whether negative emissions from bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) are sustainably achievable, if at all. Reliable carbon accounting frameworks and policy incentives are needed to improve investment prospects. The direct extraction of CO2 from air, or direct air capture (DAC), has since been demonstrated as a source of negative emissions. The large energy and economic costs associated with extracting CO2 from air are proving prohibitive to achieving commercial viability of DAC technology.

As of 20 July 2015, 46 countries, including the 28 Member States of the European Union, have submitted INDCs to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This policy paper considers whether the INDCs submitted so far are consistent with the 2\u00b0C limit. It finds that, whilst the INDCs represent progress compared with a \u2018business as usual\u2019 global emissions pathway, there is a gap between current ambitions and the actions that need to be taken to limit a rise in global average temperature to no more than 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial level. Key findings: The INDCs submitted as of 20 July 2015 would lead to annual global emissions in 2030 of 56.9 to 59.1 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030. This is much higher than the 36 billion tonnes that the United Nations Environment Programme has indicated would be consistent with having a 50 to 66 per cent chance of avoiding a rise in global average temperature of more than 2\u00b0C above its pre-industrial level. The INDCs also fall well short of the global emissions target of 42 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2030, in the scenario that technologies \u2013 such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) \u2013 can create significant \u2018negative emissions\u2019. The authors also reiterate the findings of a previous paper that countries should focus on four key ways to increase the ambitions of emissions cuts both before and after the Paris summit: Hard work is needed over the next few months by all countries to find credible ways of achieving bigger emissions reductions which can be included in pledges to be submitted before the Paris summit, or achieved through additional efforts by partnerships, for example, through specific decarbonisation initiatives among willing countries. An intensification of efforts to increase investment and innovation \u2013 particularly in relation to the development of cities, energy systems and land use \u2013 could help to close the gap between countries intentions and the emissions reduction goal before and after 2030.

As nuclear power and fossil power plants equipped with carbon capture and storage were ruled out in 2011, renewable electricity generation (RES) together with electricity savings are the primary focus for achieving decarbonization. Germany aims to have RES account for at least 80% of its electricity by 2050. Achieving renewable generation needs strong political support and regulatory provisions for its market integration. Four main technical and regulatory challenges are the maintenance of a steady and efficient expansion of RES, the provision of balancing capacities, the realization of the targeted electricity savings, and the smart adaptation of the transport and distribution grid. An overview of the existing and planned regulatory provisions for decarbonization are described, and some gaps identified, particularly with regard to the overall management of the process, the inclusion of electricity savings and the interference of Germany's decarbonization strategies with neighbouring countries. Policies that both accelerate grid expansion and direct RES expansion should immediately be put in place and can be supported by a targeted mobilization of balancing capacities. Electricity savings are a significant and cost-efficient strategy for low-carbon electricity. Policy relevance Germany is actively converting its national electricity system towards a fully renewable one. As renewable electricity has reached about a quarter of total consumption, a number of technical and regulatory challenges arise. Current discussions and plans are described for the four main challenges: maintaining and optimizing high investment rates into RES generation technologies, providing balancing capacities, reducing demand, and adapting the grid to the changing needs. Policy recommendations for these four tasks highlight the need to intensify electricity demand reduction and also consider the potential interactions between the German electricity system and its neighbouring countries.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "7bd40f0bd3068e4868ea8c6fa2124b8d3b48cd39", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "conf/syscon/SaraSH15", "MAG": "1488347034", "DOI": "10.1109/SYSCON.2015.7116743", "CorpusId": 2977419}, "title": "Assessing complexity of carbon capture and storage using multi-criteria decision-making methods", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been considered worldwide a key strategy for reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from power plants and large energy-intensive industries burning fossil fuels.

Chemical-looping combustion is a method of combustion where CO2 is inherently separated from the non-condensable components in the flue gas without the need for an energy intensive air separation unit. This is because nitrogen from the combustion air is never mixed with the fuel. Instead, oxygen carriers, in the form of metal oxide particles, circulate between two interconnected fluidized reactors and transfer oxygen from the air to the fuel through heterogeneous gas-solid redox reactions. The technology could also be adapted for the production of hydrogen from fossil fuels with CO2 separation, i.e. chemical-looping reforming. \n \n108 different oxygen-carriers based on iron-, manganese-, copper- and nickel oxides have been investigated. These carriers are prepared with inert material to increase the lifetime and performance of the particles. All particles but one have been produced by a freeze-granulation method. In order to optimize the performance of the particles, the sintering temperature of the particles was varied between 950\u00b0C and 1600\u00b0C. Normally particles of the size range of 125-180 \uf06dm have been used for the reactivity investigations. Screening tests were performed in a laboratory fluidized-bed reactor of quartz placed in a furnace. The particles were exposed to an environment simulating a real chemical-looping combustor, by alternating between reducing (50% CH4 / 50 % H2O) and oxidizing conditions (5% O2 in N2). The temperature was varied in the range 600 \u2013 950\u00b0C with most experiments conducted at 950\u00b0C. In addition the particles were characterized with respect to strength, physical appearance and chemical structure before and after the experiments. Some suitable oxygen carriers were investigated in more detail in the fluidized bed, and parameters such as reaction temperature, particle size, reducing gas and experimental method were varied. \n \nWith respect to reactivity with methane, the different oxygen carriers can generally be ranked in the order nickel> copper> manganese> iron whereas the crushing strength roughly follows the opposite order. Several types of inert material were used in this work, and this was found to be a very important parameter. It was found that inert material based on alumina and zirconia in general resulted in promising oxygen carriers, whereas titania, silica and magnesia were less promising with respect to reactivity or lifetime of the particles. Using a low sintering temperature in preparation is associated with a high reactivity, but also a low strength. This is because the higher temperatures provoke a breakdown of the internal porous structure which also makes them denser. Twelve out of the initial 108 particles were not useful for different reasons, including melting, lack of structure and lack of reactivity due to formation of non-reducible species. \n \nThe majority of the investigated oxygen carriers are well suited for chemical-looping combustion taking into consideration the important criteria of reactivity, high conversion of the fuel, relatively high strength and ability to withstand de-fluidization, agglomeration, fragmentation and abrasion.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "5a0dfee8c3585c91ae63f186f47acd5c94dc0b89", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2312728298", "DOI": "10.3997/2214-4609.201400921", "CorpusId": 130096620}, "title": "4D Joint Pre-stack Seismic Stratigraphic Inversion of the Sleipner-CO2 Case", "abstract": "Time-lapse seismic data acquisition and processing is a mature technology to monitor changes of rock properties due to hydrocarbon production.

Modelling the role of H2 as grid-scale energy storage, often referred as \u201cpower-to-gas-to-power (P2G2P)\u201d overlooks the cost-sharing and emission benefits from using the deployed H2 production and storage assets to also supply H2 for decarbonizing other end-use sectors where direct electrification may be challenged. Here, we develop a generalized modelling framework for co-optimizing energy infrastructure investment and operation across power and transportation sectors and the supply chains of electricity and H2, while accounting for spatio-temporal variations in energy demand and supply. Applying this sector-coupling framework to the U.S. Northeast under a range of technology cost and carbon price scenarios, we find a greater value of power-to-H2 (P2G) versus P2G2P routes. P2G provides flexible demand response, while the extra cost and efficiency penalties of P2G2P routes make the solution less attractive for grid balancing. The effects of sector-coupling are significant, boosting renewable energy generation by 12-55% with both increased capacities and reduced curtailments and reducing the total system cost (or levelized costs of energy) by 6-14% under 96% decarbonization scenarios. Both the cost savings and emission reductions from sector coupling increase with H2 demand for other end-uses, more than doubling for a 96% decarbonization scenario as H2 demand quadraples. Moreover, we found that the deployment of carbon capture and storage is more cost-effective in the H2 sector because of the lower cost and higher utilization rate.

One area of developing research is the use of concentrating solar power (CSP), where the solar energy is concentrated by using mirrors to direct the sunlight towards a collector filled with a heat transfer fluid (HTF). The HTF transfers the collected energy into pressurized steam, which is used to generate energy. The greater the energy collected by the HTF, the more efficent the electrical energy production is, thus the overall efficiency is controlled by the thermal fluid. Commercial HTFs such as Therminol{reg_sign} (VP-1), which is a blend of biphenyl and diphenyl oxide, have a significant vapor pressure, especially at elevated temperatures. In order for these volatile compounds to be used in CSP systems, the system either has to be engineered to prevent the phase change (i.e., volatilization and condensation) through pressurization of the system, or operate across the phase change. Over thirty years ago, a class of low-melting organic compounds were developed with negligible vapor pressure. These compounds are referred to as ionic liquids (ILs), which are organic-based compounds with discrete charges that cause a significant decrease in their vapor pressure. As amore\u00a0\u00bb class, ILs are molten salts with a melting point below 100 C and can have a liquidus range approaching 400 C, and in several cases freezing points being below 0 C. Due to the lack of an appreciable vapor pressure, volatilization of an IL is not possible at atmospheric pressure, which would lead to a simplification of the design if used as a thermal fluid and for energy storage materials. Though the lack of a vapor pressure does not make the use of ILs a better HTF, the lack of a vapor pressure is a compliment to their higher heat capacity, higher volummetric density, and thus higher volumetric heat capacity. These favorable physical properties give ILs a pontential advantage over the current commerically used thermal fluids. Also within the past decade nanofluids have gained attention for thermal conductivity enhancment of fluids, but little analysis has been completed on the heat capacity effects of the nanoparticle addition. The idea of ILs or nanofluids as a HTF is not new, as there are several references that have proposed the idea. However, the use of ionic liquid nanofluids containing nanomaterials other than carbon nanotubes has never before been studied. Here, for the first time, nano-particle enhanced ILs (NEILs) have been shown to increase the heat capacity of the IL with no adverse side effects to the ILs thermal stability and, only at high nanoparticle loading, are the IL physical properties affected. An increase of volumetric heat capacity translates into a better heat transfer fluid as more energy is stored per volumetric unit in the solar concentrating section, thus more efficency in increased steam pressure. Results show that the properties of the NEIL are highly dependant on the suspended nanomaterial and careful materials selection is required to fully optimize the nanofluid properties.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "55d9e1b0b2998ed21b016d1f809acfea30d5bca9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2466271756", "DOI": "10.3929/ETHZ-A-006716440", "CorpusId": 114594748}, "title": "Public perception of carbon dioxide capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "8474e04c82a2741c4cdde4213d980b37335bc466", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2982381134", "DOI": "10.4067/s0718-27242019000300003", "CorpusId": 211383234}, "title": "Perspectives on The Techno-Economic Analysis of Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is required in order to reduce the impact of fossil fuel burning on global warming and the resulting climate change.

Anthropogenic carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere through burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) in power plants and energy production facilities, and solid waste, trees, and other biological materials. It is also the result of certain chemical reactions in different industry (e.g., cement and steel industries). Carbon capture and storage (CCS), among other options, is an essential technology for the cost-effective mitigation of anthropogenic CO2 emissions and could contribute approximately 20% to CO2 emission reductions by 2050, as recommended by International Energy Agency (IEA). Although CCS has enormous potential in numerous industries and petroleum refineries due their large CO2 emissions, a significant impediment to its utilization on a large scale remains both operating and capital costs. It is possible to reduce the costs of CCS for the cases where industrial processes generate pure or rich CO2 gas streams, but they are still an obstacle to its implementation. Therefore, significant interest was dedicated to the development of improved sorbents with increased CO2 capacity and/or reduced heat of regeneration. However, recent results show that phase equilibria, transport properties (e.g., viscosity, diffusion coefficients, etc.) and other thermophysical properties (e.g., heat capacity, density, etc.) could have a significant effect on the price of the carbon.

We studied the phase behavior of carbon dioxide and different classes of organic substances, to illustrate the functional group effect on the solvent ability to dissolve CO2. In this chapter, we explain the role of phase equilibria in carbon capture and storage.
