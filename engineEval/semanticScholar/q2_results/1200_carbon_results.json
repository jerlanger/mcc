A numerical model of the subsurface at a proposed power plant with CO2 capture is developed to simulate a planned pilot test, in which 1,000,000 metric tons of CO2 is injected over a 4-year period, and the subsequent evolution of the CO2 plume for hundreds of years. Key measures are plume migration distance and the time evolution of the partitioning of CO2 between dissolved, immobile free-phase, and mobile free-phase forms. Model results indicate that the injected CO2 plume is effectively immobilized at 25\u00a0years. At that time, 38% of the CO2 is in dissolved form, 59% is immobile free phase, and 3% is mobile free phase. The plume footprint is roughly elliptical, and extends much farther up-dip of the injection well than down-dip. The pressure increase extends far beyond the plume footprint, but the pressure response decreases rapidly with distance from the injection well, and decays rapidly in time once injection ceases.

The target can be reached only if future global per-capita aluminium stocks saturate at a level much lower than that in present major industrialized countries. As long as global in-use stocks are growing rapidly, radical new technologies in primary production (for example, inert anode and carbon capture and storage) have the greatest impact in emission reduction; however, their window of opportunity is closing once the stocks begin to saturate and the largest reduction potential shifts to post-consumer scrap recycling.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "77a33041141070340838d24dc7b1cbab5aa9b9ef", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2160468086", "DOI": "10.1021/IE202693Q", "CorpusId": 98750466}, "title": "CO2 Sequestration in Chrysotile Mining Residues\u2014Implication of Watering and Passivation under Environmental Conditions", "abstract": "Factors affecting carbon dioxide fixation in chrysotile mining residues (CMR) under environmental conditions were studied by reproducing mineral dissolution and carbonation in laboratory columns packed with CMR particles.

Innovation in physical technologies and social behaviours is key to this transformation. But innovation has not been at the heart of economic models of climate change. This paper reviews the state of the art on the economics of innovation, applies recent insights to climate change. The core insight is that technological innovation is a path-dependent process in which history and expectations matter greatly in determining eventual outcomes This insight has six important implications for climate policy design. First, efficient climate policy requires direct research subsidies for inducing and/or diffusing clean innovations, combined with carbon pricing (whether by taxes or trading). Second, both public and private sector involvement is required \u2014 private market forces need to be mobilised and redirected towards cleaner energy sources by governments. Third, path dependence and system inertia imply that delaying policies that redirect innovation towards clean technologies significantly increases costs in the future. Fourth, more developed countries should act as leaders in clean technology and should subsidise access to such technologies for less developed countries. At the same time, they should consider the possibility of using border carbon adjustments against any country that would take advantage of the new environmental policies by specialising in the production and export of fossil fuel intensive products. Fifth, if a transition from coal to clean energy is to be made via intermediates (for example, gas), the use of gas (without carbon capture) should be agreed to be on a time-limited basis. Further, to avoid gas lock-in, research in fully clean technologies would need to be strongly stepped up over the intervening period, along with other supportive policies. Finally, investment in coal should not be encouraged, as its continued use is only safe if we assume the cost-effectiveness of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. While much greater efforts should be taken to reduce the costs of CCS, the speed that these technologies can be developed and deployed is uncertain.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "e9cf9c9fae305cff2fedd2dc906d7d81a130665d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3119503318", "DOI": "10.3390/EN14020387", "CorpusId": 234288070}, "title": "A Review on CO2 Capture Technologies with Focus on CO2-Enhanced Methane Recovery from Hydrates", "abstract": "Natural gas is considered a helpful transition fuel in order to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of other conventional power plants burning coal or liquid fossil fuels. Natural Gas Hydrates (NGHs) constitute the largest reservoir of natural gas in the world. Methane contained within the crystalline structure can be replaced by carbon dioxide to enhance gas recovery from hydrates. This technical review presents a techno-economic analysis of the full pathway, which begins with the capture of CO2 from power and process industries and ends with its transportation to a geological sequestration site consisting of clathrate hydrates. Since extracted methane is still rich in CO2, on-site separation is required. Focus is thus placed on membrane-based gas separation technologies widely used for gas purification and CO2 removal from raw natural gas and exhaust gas. Nevertheless, the other carbon capture processes (i.e., oxy-fuel combustion, pre-combustion and post-combustion) are briefly discussed and their carbon capture costs are compared with membrane separation technology. Since a large-scale Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) facility requires CO2 transportation and storage infrastructure, a technical, cost and safety assessment of CO2 transportation over long distances is carried out.

Global temperature is a fundamental climate metric highly correlated with sea level, which implies that keeping shorelines near their present location requires keeping global temperature within or close to its preindustrial Holocene range. However, global temperature excluding short-term variability now exceeds +1\u202f\u00b0C relative to the 1880\u20131920\u00a0mean and annual\u00a02016 global temperature was almost +1.3\u202f\u00b0C. We show that global temperature has risen well out of the Holocene range and Earth is now as warm as it was during the prior (Eemian) interglacial period, when sea level reached 6\u20139\u202fm higher than today. Further, Earth is out of energy balance with present atmospheric composition, implying that more warming is in the pipeline, and we show that the growth rate of greenhouse gas climate forcing has accelerated markedly in the past decade. The rapidity of ice sheet and sea level response to global temperature is difficult to predict, but is dependent on the magnitude of warming. Targets for limiting global warming thus, at minimum, should aim to avoid leaving global temperature at Eemian or higher levels for centuries. Such targets now require negative emissions , i.e., extraction of CO2 from the air. If phasedown of fossil fuel emissions begins soon, improved agricultural and forestry practices, including reforestation and steps to improve soil fertility and increase its carbon content, may provide much of the necessary CO2 extraction. In that case, the magnitude and duration of global temperature excursion above the natural range of the current interglacial (Holocene) could be limited and irreversible climate impacts could be minimized. In contrast, continued high fossil fuel emissions today place a burden on young people to undertake massive technological CO2 extraction if they are to limit climate change and its consequences. Proposed methods of extraction such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage\u00a0(BECCS) or air capture of CO2 have minimal estimated costs of USD\u202f89\u2013535 trillion this century and also have large risks and uncertain feasibility.

In 2003, growing vegetation in North America removed approximately 500 million tons of carbon per year (\u00b150%) from the atmosphere and stored it as plant material and soil organic matter. This land sink is equivalent to approximately 30% of the fossil-fuel emissions from North America. The imbalance between the fossil-fuel source and the sink on land is a net release to the atmosphere of 1350 million metric tons of carbon per year (\u00b1 25%). Approximately 50% of North America\u2019s terrestrial sink is due to the regrowth of forests in the United States on former agricultural land that was last cultivated decades ago, and on timberland recovering from harvest. Other sinks are relatively small and not well quantified with uncertainties of 100% or more. The future of the North American terrestrial sink is also highly uncertain. The contribution of forest regrowth is expected to decline as the maturing forests grow more slowly and take up less CO2 from the atmosphere. But this expectation is surrounded by uncertainty because how regrowing forests and other sinks will respond to changes in climate and CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is highly uncertain. The large difference between current sources and sinks and the expectation that the difference could become larger if the growth of fossil-fuel emissions continues and land sinks decline suggest that addressing imbalances in the North American carbon budget will likely require actions focused on reducing fossil-fuel emissions. Options to enhance sinks (growing forests or sequestering carbon in agricultural soils) can contribute, but enhancing sinks alone is likely insufficient to deal with either the current or future imbalance. Options to reduce emissions include efficiency improvement, fuel switching, and technologies such as carbon capture and geological storage. Implementing these options will likely require an array of policy instruments at local, regional, national, and international levels, ranging from the encouragement of voluntary actions to economic incentives, tradable emissions permits, and regulations. Meeting the demand for information by decision makers will likely require new modes of research characterized by close collaboration between scientists and carbon management stakeholders. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program Executive Summary 2 3 ES.1 SyNTHES S AND ASSESSMENT OF THE NORTH AMER CAN CARBON BUDGET Understanding the North American carbon budget, both sources and sinks, is critical to the United States Climate Change Science Program goal of providing the best possible scientific information to support public discussion, as well as government and private sector decision making, on key climate-related issues. In response, this report provides a synthesis, integration, and assessment of the current knowledge of the North American carbon budget and its context within the global carbon cycle. The report focuses on the carbon cycle as it influences the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. Methane (CH4), nitrous oxide, and other greenhouse gases are also relevant to climate issues, but their consideration is beyond the scope and mandate of this report. The report is organized as a response to questions relevant to carbon management and to a broad range of stakeholders charged with understanding and managing energy and land use. The questions were identified through early and continuing dialogue with these stakeholders, including scientists; decision makers in the public and private sectors, including national and sub-national government; carbon-related industries, such as energy, transportation, agriculture, and forestry; and climate policy and carbon management interest groups. The questions and the answers provided by this report are summarized below. The reader is referred to the indicated chapters for further, more detailed, discussion. Unless otherwise referenced, all values, statements of findings and conclusions are taken from the chapters of this report where the attribution and citation of the primary sources can be found. ES.2 WHAT S THE CARBON CyCLE AND WHy SHOULD WE CARE? The carbon cycle, described in Chapters 1 and 2, is the combination of many different physical, chemical, and biological processes that transfer carbon between the major storage pools (known as reservoirs): the atmosphere, plants, soils, freshwater systems, oceans, and geological sediments. Hundreds of millions of years ago, and over millions of years, this carbon cycle was responsible for the formation of coal, petroleum, and natural gas, the fossil fuels that are the primary sources of energy for our modern societies. Humans have altered the Earth\u2019s carbon budget. Today, the cycling of carbon among atmosphere, land, and freshwater and marine environments is in rapid transition and out of balance. Over tens of years, the combustion of fossil fuels is releasing into the atmosphere quantities of carbon that were accumulated in the Earth system over millions of years. Furthermore, tropical forests that once held large quantities of carbon are being converted to agricultural lands, releasing additional carbon to the atmosphere as a result. Both the fossil-fuel and land-use related releases are sources of carbon to the atmosphere. The combined rate of release is far larger than can be balanced by the biological and geological processes that naturally remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it in terrestrial and marine environments as part of the Earth\u2019s carbon cycle. These processes are known as sinks. Therefore, much of the CO2 released through human activity has \u201cpiled up\u201d in the atmosphere, resulting in a dramatic increase in the atmospheric concentration of CO2. The concentration increased by 31% between 1850 and 2003, and the present concentration is higher than at any time in the past 420,000 years. Because CO2 is an important greenhouse gas, the imbalance between sources and sinks and the subsequent increase in concentration in the atmosphere is very likely causing changes in Earth\u2019s climate (IPCC, 2007). Furthermore, these trends in fossil-fuel use and tropical deforestation are accelerating. The magnitude of the changes raises concerns about the future behavior of the carbon cycle. Will the carbon cycle continue to function as it has in recent history, or will a CO2-caused warming result in a weakening of the ability of sinks to take up CO2, leading to further warming? Drought, for example, may reduce forest growth. Warming can release carbon stored in soil, and warming and drought may increase forest fires. Conversely, will elevated concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere stimulate plant growth as it is known to do in laboratory and field experiments and thus strengthen global or regional sinks? The question is complicated because CO2 is not the only substance in the atmosphere that affects the Earth\u2019s surface temperature and climate. Other greenhouse gases include CH4, nitrous oxide, the halocarbons, and ozone, and all of these gases, together with water vapor, aerosols, solar radiation, and properties of the Earth\u2019s surface, are involved in the evolution of climate change. Carbon dioxide, alone, is responsible for approximately 55-60% of the change in the Earth\u2019s radiation balance due to increases in well-mixed atmospheric greenhouse gases and CH4 for about another 20% (values are for the late 1990s; with a relative uncertainty of The rate of CO2 released to the atmosphere is far larger than can be balanced by the biological and geological processes that naturally remove CO2 from the atmosphere and store it in terrestrial and marine environments.

Here a simple but effective approach is presented based on enrichment of a robust microbial community via several culture transfers with H2:CO2 conditions. This culture produced acetate at a concentration of 1.29 \u00b1 0.15 g L(-1) (maximum up to 1.5 g L(-1); 25 mM) from CO2 at a fixed current of -5 Am(-2) in fed-batch bioelectrochemical reactors at high N2:CO2 flow rates.

This is a considerably high rate compared with other unmodified carbon-based cathodes. 58 \u00b1 5% of the electrons was recovered in acetate, whereas 30 \u00b1 10% of the electrons was recovered in H2 as a secondary product. The bioproduction was most likely H2 based; however, electrochemical, confocal microscopy, and community analyses of the cathodes suggested the possible involvement of the cathodic biofilm.

On this basis, there is limited experience for design and economic assessment of CO2 pipeline. The Humber region in the UK is a likely site for building CO2 pipelines in the future due to large CO2 emissions in the region and its close access to depleted gas fields and saline aquifers beneath the North Sea. In this paper, various issues to be considered in CO2 pipeline design for carbon capture and storage applications are discussed. Also, different techno-economic correlations for CO2 pipelines are assessed using the Humber region as a case study.

Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are crystalline materials with ultrahigh porosity, tunable pore size, and rich functionalities, holding the promise for CO2 capture. However, the intrinsic fragility and depressed processability of MOF crystals make the fabrication of the flexible MOF nanofibrous membrane (NFM) rather challenging. Herein, we demonstrate an effective strategy for the versatile preparation of self-supported and flexible HKUST-1 NFM with ultrahigh HKUST-1 loading (up to 82 wt %) and stable and uniform HKUST-1 growth through the combination of electrospinning, multistep seeded growth, and activation process. The loading rate of MOF is the highest level among the reported analogues. Significantly, the HKUST-1 NFM exhibits a prominent CO2 adsorption capacity of 3.9 mmol g-1, good CO2/N2 selectivity, and remarkable recyclability. The CO2 capacity retains \u223c95% (3.7 mmol g-1) of the initial value after 100 adsorption-desorption cycles, indicating that the HKUST-1 NFM has long-term and ultrastable recyclability and a significant practical value.

When using water, capture efficiencies exceeded 50% and could be enhanced by adding base (e.g., sodium hydroxide) or the combination of base and carbonic anhydrase, a catalyst that speeds the conversion of CO2 to carbonic acid. The transferred CO2 formed ions, such as bicarbonate or carbonate, depending on the amount of base present. Adding precipitating cations, like Ca++, produced insoluble carbonate salts. Simulated brine proved nearly as efficient as water in absorbing CO2, with less than a 6% reduction in CO2 transferred. The CO2 either dissolved into the brine or formed a mixture of gas and ions. If the chemistry was favorable, carbonate precipitate spontaneously formed. Energy expenditure of pumping brine up and down from subterranean depths was modeled.

Scattered patches of dark, charcoal-rich soil known as terra preta (Portuguese for \u201cblack earth\u201d) are the inspiration for an international effort to explore how burying biomass-derived charcoal, or \u201cbiochar,\u201d could boost soil fertility and transfer a sizeable amount from the atmosphere into safe storage in of CO2 topsoil. Although burial of biochar is just beginning to be tested in long-term, field-scale trials, studies of Amazonian terra preta show that charcoal can lock up carbon in the soil for centuries and improve soil fertility. \n \nCharcoal is made by heating wood or other organic material with a limited supply of oxygen (a process termed \u201cpyrolysis\u201d). The products of the pyrolysis process vary by the raw material used, burning time, and temperature, but in principle, volatile hydrocarbons and most of the oxygen and hydrogen in the biomass are burned or driven off, leaving carbon-enriched black solids with a structure that resists chemical and microbial degradation. Christoph Steiner, a research scientist at the University of Georgia, says the difference between charcoal and biochar lies primarily in the end use. \u201cCharcoal is a fuel, and biochar has a nonfuel use that makes carbon sequestration feasible,\u201d he explains. \u201cOtherwise there is no difference between charcoal carbon and biochar carbon.\u201d \n \nCharcoal is traditionally made by burning wood in pits or temporary structures, but modern pyrolysis equipment greatly reduces the air pollution associated with this practice. Gases emitted from pyrolysis can be captured to generate valuable products instead of being released as smoke. Some of the by-products can be condensed into \u201cbio-oil,\u201d a liquid that can be upgraded to fuels including biodiesel and synthesis gas. A portion of the noncondensable fraction is burned to heat the pyrolysis chamber, and the rest can provide heat or fuel an electric generator. \n \nPyrolysis equipment now being developed at several public and private institutions typically operate at 350\u2013700\u00b0C. In Golden, Colorado, Biochar Engineering Corporation is building portable $50,000 pyrolyzers that researchers will use to produce 1\u20132 tons of biochar per week.

Biochar fees range from 52 to 131 GBP per ton CO2, which indicates that biochar production is a realistic strategy that can be deployed at large scale. Carbon removal services via biochar are currently offered through robust marketplaces that require extensive certification, verification and monitoring, which adds an element of credibility and authenticity.

The recent IPCC reports state that continued anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are changing the climate, threatening severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts. Slow progress in emissions reduction to mitigate climate change is resulting in increased attention to what is called geoengineering, climate engineering, or climate intervention \u2013 deliberate interventions to counter climate change that seek to either modify the Earth's radiation budget or remove greenhouse gases such as CO2 from the atmosphere. When focused on CO2, the latter of these categories is called carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Future emission scenarios that stay well below 2\u202f\u00b0C, and all emission scenarios that do not exceed 1.5\u202f\u00b0C warming by the year 2100, require some form of CDR. At present, there is little consensus on the climate impacts and atmospheric CO2 reduction efficacy of the different types of proposed CDR. To address this need, the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (or CDRMIP) was initiated. This project brings together models of the Earth system in a common framework to explore the potential, impacts, and challenges of CDR. Here, we describe the first set of CDRMIP experiments, which are formally part of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). These experiments are designed to address questions concerning CDR-induced climate reversibility , the response of the Earth system to direct atmospheric CO2 removal (direct air capture and storage), and the CDR potential and impacts of afforestation and reforestation, as well as ocean alkalinization.>", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "4efe6435aa2072264fbde20bcc7926149ccb31de", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2534381987", "DOI": "10.1007/s11356-016-7863-y", "CorpusId": 43375336, "PubMed": "27752956"}, "title": "The effects of ocean acidification and a carbon dioxide capture and storage leak on the early life stages of the marine mussel Perna perna (Linneaus, 1758) and metal bioavailability", "abstract": "The study assesses the effects of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) leaks and ocean acidification (OA) on the metal bioavailability and reproduction of the mytilid Perna perna.

There are geoengineering techniques of CO 2 capture and storage into old oil wells to enhance oil recovery (EOR) and access coalbed methane (CBM), store in saline aquifers and sedimentary rocks, and combine it with basalt where it goes through chemical transformations. Geoengineering techniques have relatively high sink capacity and also high costs. Further, geoengineering techniques require measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) protocols. In contrast, C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems (soil and biota) is based on the natural process of photosynthesis, and humification of biosolids applied to the soil. Terrestrial pools have relatively lower sink capacity, but are cost-effective and have numerous ancillary benefits. Total CO 2 drawdown is estimated at reduction in 50 ppm of atmospheric concentration over 5 decades. Increasing C pool in agricultural soils is essential to advancing food security, and that in degraded/desertified soils to improve the environment. Rather than either/or scenarios, both strategies of C sequestration via geoengineering and terrestrial strategies have specific niches which need to be carefully and objectively identified and implemented.

Plant and microbial parameters were monitored in artificial CO2 release experiments in the field and in greenhouses. In addition, plants and microorganisms were monitored in CO2 storage sites. We review the findings from these studies and suggest directions of future research for determining the impact of potential CO2 leakage from CCS sites on plants and microorganisms. Our review showed that under high levels of soil CO2, (i) plant stress response was visible within short period of time; (ii) dicots were more sensitive than monocots in most studies; and (iii) the responses of microorganisms were more diverse and harder to generalize than those of plants. Only a limited number of field and greenhouse experimental studies have been conducted so far, and thus more field and greenhouse experimental studies are needed to better understand the plant and microbial response to elevated soil CO2 levels and elucidate specific mechanisms underlying these responses. Determining the ecological impacts of geological CO2 storage and ensuring its environmental safety via such research will make CCS a more viable technology. \u00a9 2016 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "79e00ffedbd30f822c9731d0f1f50e6df9fcbe03", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2052336245", "DOI": "10.1039/C4TA04038D", "CorpusId": 97677464}, "title": "Cross-linked polymers of diethynylbenzene and phenylacetylene as new polymer precursors for high-yield synthesis of high-performance nanoporous activated carbons for supercapacitors, hydrogen storage, and CO2 capture", "abstract": "We demonstrate in this article the first use of a family of cross-linked polymers synthesized from acetylenic monomers (diethynylbenzene and phenylacetylene) as new polymer precursors for high-yield synthesis of nanoporous activated carbons of tuneable textural properties. A range of cross-linked polymers of varying cross-linking densities has been tailor synthesized via catalytic polymerization of the monomers. Their carbonization in the presence of KOH as the activation agent renders effectively high-surface-area, predominantly microporous activated carbons of unique textural properties (surface area up to 1418 m2 g\u22121; pore volume up to 0.78 cm3 g\u22121) at high yields (ca. 70 wt%). It is discovered that the textural properties of the resulting carbon materials (including surface area, pore volume, pore size and pore size distribution) depend sensitively on the cross-linking density of the polymer precursors and are thus tuneable through polymer design. With their unique textural properties, the high-surface-area activated carbons exhibit superior performance in applications both as electrode materials in supercapacitors and as sorbents for H2 storage and CO2 capture. High specific capacitance (up to 446 F g\u22121 at 0.5 A g\u22121 in 3-electrode cell; 334 F g\u22121 at 0.1 A g\u22121 and 287 F g\u22121 at 0.5 A g\u22121 in 2-electrode cell) has been obtained for the electrodes fabricated with these carbons.

If a 2\u00b0C warming by 2100 is to be prevented, it will become important to adopt strategies that not only avoid CO2 emissions but also allow for the direct removal of CO2 from the atmosphere, enabling the intervention of climate change. The primary direct removal methods discussed in this review include land management and mineral carbonation in addition to bioenergy and direct air capture with carbon capture and reliable storage. These methods are discussed in detail, and their potential for CO2 removal is assessed. The global upper bound for annual CO2 removal was estimated to be 12, 10, 6, and 5 GtCO2/year for bioenergy with carbon capture and reliable storage (BECCS), direct air capture with reliable storage (DACS), land management, and mineral carbonation, respectively\u2014giving a cumulative value of ~35 GtCO2/year.

The upper bounds on the costs associated with the direct CO2 removal methods varied from approximately $100/tCO2 (land management, BECCS, and mineral carbonation) to $1000/tCO2 for DACS (again, these are the upper bounds for costs). In this review, these direct CO2 removal technologies are found to be technically viable and are potentially important options in preventing 2\u00b0C warming by 2100.

However, a key obstacle to its deployment on a large scale remains its cost \u2013 both capital and operating costs. In this context, the development of improved sorbents is a key research priority. Consequently, there is a vast global effort to develop new materials for this purpose, with literally thousands of new materials having been proposed since the beginning of the millennium. One common element of these contributions is that they focus on the equilibrium capacity of the material to absorb CO2 and rarely, if ever, other key factors such as transport properties. To date, the majority of this effort has cost significant amounts of time and resources and has almost exclusively focused on developing sorbents with increased CO2 capacity and/or reduced heat of regeneration. Given that sorbent regeneration largely dictates operational cost, this would, on the surface, appear rational. However, it is vital to recall that the cost structure of $ per MWh of electricity generated is composed of contributions from both capital and operational costs. Consequently, this single-minded focus on equilibrium CO2 capacity and heat of regeneration excludes the contribution of transport and kinetic properties which determine the equipment size and thus the capital cost. Therefore, in order to develop sorbents which will result in a non-negligible cost reduction, it is essential to move beyond equilibrium-based metrics of sorbent performance. In this paper, we present a new methodological approach for sorbent screening which explicitly includes rate-based phenomena. Our approach uses both monetised and non-monetised performance indicators. Our results suggest that whilst equilibrium CO2 capacity is a key determinant of process performance, transport properties (e.g., viscosity) and other thermophysical properties (e.g., heat capacity) have a significant effect on the capital cost, and thus on the price of the carbon captured.

Thus the policy and regulatory frameworks governing CRD activities must be tailored to each particular approach. Moreover, policy differentiation is not just about selecting preferred techniques, but above all about ensuring that techniques that are deployed are implemented appropriately. For example, some studies suggest that poorly implemented BEECS strategies could actually increase GHG emissions through indirect land use changes (for example, energy crops displacing food production and encouraging additional forest clearances) (Creutzig et al. 2012). One could imagine governments directly financing activities to draw down CO2 as a public good, but the thrust of climate policy to this point has been to make emitting entities responsible for abatement, and to enlist the price mechanism (through a carbon tax or cap and trade system) to encourage adaptation across the economy. On this model, CDR activities would result in carbon dioxide reduction credits. Whichever CDR approaches are favored, their integration into mitigation frameworks requires mechanisms to: a) establish atmospheric withdrawals are actually taking place at the intended levels, b) ensure the long term security of the sequestered carbon, and c) minimize collateral damage. Quantitative verification of CO2 flows is required for national greenhouse gas inventories and compliance with international accords; but it is also critical for businesses. While reasonably accurate estimates of emissions and emissions reductions can be made from data on fossil fuel consumption, things are more complex with removals. Consider forests: actual CO2 uptake varies according to forest types, species mix, maturity, and climactic conditions. Carbon uptake will be spread over decades and historic data on forest growth may prove misleading, especially as the climate changes. While quantifying CO2 sent for geological storage from BECCS or air capture may be reasonably straightforward, the same is far from true for biochar, enhanced weathering or ocean fertilization. This implies strict protocols for the operation of CDR projects, and appropriate measurement and verification regimes. For CDR to be effective, sequestration must be for the long term. What happens if a newly planted forest is eroded by agriculture, settlement, fire, or insect attack; if geologic storage for air capture or BECCS proves insecure; or fraud exaggerates long term sequestration figures? In many cases measurement and monitoring will have to continue for the long term. It also implies the preparation of appropriate remediation and compensation plans (if storage breaks down) and associated liability regimes. With respect to collateral damage, the standard assumption is that CDR would be pursued because it could be secured at favorable cost as compared to emissions abatement options. But this is only to the overall benefit of society if the full social cost (as opposed to the cost for the specific actors realizing a project) is lower for the CDR pathway. This means other \u2018externalities\u2019 accompanying CDR projects must be taken into consideration. Ultimately, the only way to deal with these is by the regulation of authorized technologies/approaches by public authorities: on the one hand, through international rules relating to each CRD class (with project compliance a pre-condition for international recognition of carbon removal credits); and on the other, through national and local rules relating to land use planning, environmental and safety issues, and so on. But the difficulty which policy systems have in managing issues of such complexity, with multiple cross-cutting interconnections and uncertainties, cannot be overstated (Meadowcroft 2007). A recurrent theme in the political science literature is the incremental, contingent and fragmented character of policy making in modern democracies; and the difficulty in pursuing \u2018rational-comprehensive\u2019 approaches to problem solving (Lindblom 1979; Kingdon 1984). It is impossible to anticipate in advance all the consequences from hypothetical CDR projects. Only with time will some impacts be appreciated, and will the benefits and costs of each CDR option be fully understood.

Estimated performance of steam cycles working with post-combustion CO2 capture plant are presented at full and part load, leading to performance predictions for pulverised-coal power plants operated over a range of loads and with varying levels of CO2 capture. By adjusting the operation of the capture plant, as well as the boiler/steam cycle, an extended range of operation can be achieved including lower minimum stable generation levels and additional 'pumped storage like' capacity for times of high demand. For example, plant operators can alter the energy penalty for the CO2 capture plant with an associated change in plant output by reducing the level of CO2 capture. This can allow extra electricity to be generated and sold when electricity prices are high. With solvent storage it should also be possible to increase power plant output for a number of hours, but without associated increases in CO2 emissions.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "7553635db2ae0e19b758ed16ff8b8b2841987823", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2916549213", "DOI": "10.3390/PR7020115", "CorpusId": 92985850}, "title": "Carbon Mineralization by Reaction with Steel-Making Waste: A Review", "abstract": "Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is taking the lead as a means for mitigating climate change. It is considered a crucial bridging technology, enabling carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fossil fuels to be reduced while the energy transition to renewable sources is taking place. CCS includes a portfolio of technologies that can possibly capture vast amounts of CO2 per year. Mineral carbonation is evolving as a possible candidate to sequester CO2 from medium-sized emissions point sources. It is the only recognized form of permanent CO2 storage with no concerns regarding CO2 leakage. It is based on the principles of natural rock weathering, where the CO2 dissolved in rainwater reacts with alkaline rocks to form carbonate minerals. The active alkaline elements (Ca/Mg) are the fundamental reactants for mineral carbonation reaction. Although the reaction is thermodynamically favored, it takes place over a large time scale. The challenge of mineral carbonation is to offset this limitation by accelerating the carbonation reaction with minimal energy and feedstock consumption. Calcium and magnesium silicates are generally selected for carbonation due to their abundance in nature. Industrial waste residues emerge as an alternative source of carbonation minerals that have higher reactivity than natural minerals; they are also inexpensive and readily available in proximity to CO2 emitters. In addition, the environmental stability of the industrial waste is often enhanced as they undergo carbonation. Recently, direct mineral carbonation has been investigated significantly due to its applicability to CO2 capture and storage. This review outlines the main research work carried out over the last few years on direct mineral carbonation process utilizing steel-making waste, with emphasis on recent research achievements and potentials for future research.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "a64eaa6dff2fee7588e126d12363ae15ea57ad95", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2170541131", "DOI": "10.5539/EER.V2N2P65", "CorpusId": 20968977}, "title": "Economic Modelling of CO2 Injection for Enhanced Gas Recovery and Storage: A Reservoir Simulation Study of Operational Parameters", "abstract": "This paper focuses on the recovery factor of natural gas production and storage by injecting CO2 into a natural gas reservoir.

This study quantifies the stand-scale effects of intermediate-severity windstorms (i.e., blowdowns) on (1) live and dead legacy structure, (2) aboveground carbon storage, and (3) tree regeneration and associated stand dynamics at four mature, mixed hardwood-conifer forest sites in the northeastern United States. We compare wind-affected forests to adjacent reference conditions (i.e., undisturbed portions of the same stands) 0-8\u00a0yr post-blowdown using parametric (ANOVA) and nonparametric (NMS ordination) analyses. We supplement inventory plots and downed coarse woody detritus (DCWD) transects with hemispherical photography to capture spatial variation in the light environment. Although recent blowdowns transferred a substantial proportion of live overstory trees to DCWD, residual live tree basal area was high (19-59% of reference areas). On average, the initial post-blowdown ratio of DCWD carbon to standing live tree carbon was 2.72 in blowdown stands and 0.18 in reference stands, indicating a large carbon transfer from live to dead pools. Despite these dramatic changes, structural complexity remained high in blowdown areas, as indicated by the size and species distributions of overstory trees, abundance of sound and rotten downed wood, spatial patterns of light availability, and variability of understory vegetation. Furthermore, tree species composition was similar between blowdown and reference areas at each site, with generally shade-tolerant species dominating across multiple canopy strata. Community response to intermediate-severity blowdown at these sites suggests a dynamic in which disturbance maintains late-successional species composition rather than providing a regeneration opportunity for shade-intolerant, pioneer species. Our findings suggest that intermediate-severity wind disturbances can contribute to stand-scale structural complexity as well as development toward late-successional species composition, at least when shade-tolerant regeneration is present pre-blowdown. Advance regeneration thus enhances structural and compositional resilience to this type of disturbance.

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used for the determination of hydrate-liquid-vapor (H-L-V) equilibrium conditions in the presence of TBACl, TBANO3, and TBPB solutions at ammonium salt mass fractions of 0.3618, 0.3941, and 0.3707, respectively, and at CO2 pressure in the range of (0.5 to 2.0) MPa. Results reveal that semiclathrate hydrates of TBACl, TBANO3, and TBPB are able to incorporate carbon dioxide in their structure and that the resulting mixed hydrates have significantly lower formation pressures than those of pure CO2 hydrate. The dissociation enthalpies of semiclathrate hydrates of TBACl, TBANO3, and TBPB with CO2 were determined by both DSC and the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. The DSC experiments demonstrate that mixed hydrates of TBANO3, TBACl, and TBPB with CO2 have higher melting enthalpies than single hydrates. From our measurements, it appears that mixed TBPB + CO2 hydrate has appropriate stability conditions (p, T) and latent heat content for secondary refrigeration applications. DSC measurements combined with the Clausius-Clapeyron equation show that mixed TBPB + CO2 hydrate can store large amounts of CO2 and thus could be attractive for gas capture and storage applications. \u00a9 ?2010 American Chemical Society.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "431754831c5e9deafe7b357ac4af2cec9a168435", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2190843623", "DOI": "10.1007/s10311-015-0528-0", "CorpusId": 98610394}, "title": "Recent advances in the photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide", "abstract": "Fossil fuels are currently the major energy source and are rapidly consumed to supply the increasing energy demands of mankind.

The aboveground vegetation parameters (tree density, DBH and height) explain 59% of the variance in soil organic carbon.ConclusionsThe obtained estimates of mean carbon stocks in ecosystems representing the major land cover types are of importance in the development of forest management plan aimed at enhancing mitigation potential of dry Afromontane forests in northern Ethiopia.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "a0905247f6101582fdb0ffe1f9e3147a1a5259bf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2516957946", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2016.08.009", "CorpusId": 157950542}, "title": "Technology and demand forecasting for carbon capture and storage technology in South Korea", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "28b687fdd6737a4a87b83aa08162f606881bf741", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2945171089", "DOI": "10.3390/EN12101945", "CorpusId": 182548360}, "title": "Enabling Large-Scale Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Storage (CCUS) Using Offshore Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Infrastructure Developments\u2014A Review", "abstract": "Presently, the only offshore project for enhanced oil recovery using carbon dioxide, known as CO2-EOR, is in Brazil. Several desk studies have been undertaken, without any projects being implemented. The objective of this review is to investigate barriers to the implementation of large-scale offshore CO2-EOR projects, to identify recent technology developments, and to suggest non-technological incentives that may enable implementation. We examine differences between onshore and offshore CO2-EOR, emerging technologies that could enable projects, as well as approaches and regulatory requirements that may help overcome barriers. Our review shows that there are few, if any, technical barriers to offshore CO2-EOR. However, there are many other barriers to the implementation of offshore CO2-EOR, including: High investment and operation costs, uncertainties about reservoir performance, limited access of CO2 supply, lack of business models, and uncertainties about regulations. This review describes recent technology developments that may remove such barriers and concludes with recommendations for overcoming non-technical barriers. The review is based on a report by the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF).", "year": 2019}]}
