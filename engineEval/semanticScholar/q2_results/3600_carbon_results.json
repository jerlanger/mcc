Depleted gas reservoirs are promising candidates for the storage of carbon dioxide (CO2). Therefore, a depleted gas reservoir in the Upper Miocene sandstone located in Northern Croatia was taken as an example. The purpose of this study was to compare CO2 storage capacity obtained with two analytical equations to total storage capacity obtained through the simulator, in order to validate the equations. The first equation takes the average reservoir pressure and available production data into account, while the other one is more general and includes produced volume, CO2 density and formation volume factor of the original fluid. The tools used for these calculations were Schlumberger PVTi software, in which the equation of state was obtained, and ECLIPSE (E300 Module) which is a reservoir engineering simula- tor used for reservoir behaviour prediction. The results confirmed analytical solutions, indicating that, depending on the depth, the mass of the CO2 that can be injected is twice as big as the mass of CH4 produced. The results of analytical solutions, 16.7 \u00d7 10**6 m**3 and 14.6 \u00d7 10**6 m**3, are in accordance with the results obtained by the simulation of CO2 injection in depleted reservoirs - 16.2 \u00d7 10**6 m**3.

While the per-hectare carbon capture potential of rangelands is less than either cropland or forests, existing research suggests modest changes in carbon storage on rangelands can potentially alter the global carbon cycle. This paper examines the potential firm-level revenues from voluntary carbon offset programs, such as the Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) Rangeland Soil Carbon Offset program. We estimate revenues for short-term voluntary offsets given historical prices and prices projected with potential cap-and-trade legislation. We also estimate revenues assuming 100-yr offsets are required to meet international sequestration standards. Simulation results indicate a relatively wide range of modest revenues from recent CCX contracts and carbon prices. The analysis suggests that recent carbon prices or low-end projected prices from cap-and-trade legislation are not likely to encourage producer participation. Medium and high carbon price projections for cap-and-trade legislation may make carbon sequestration a more attractive option for rangeland managers, but given potential requirements for projects to meet international guidelines for greenhouse gas offset projects, many issues remain before range managers may be interested in carbon sequestration as an enterprise.

However, there are significant differences between established practice and the requirements of anthropogenic CO2 transport systems to be instituted in countries in other parts of the world in response to climate change. This Chapter concentrates on issues arising from those differences with particular reference to CO2 transport in the UK. Some of the issues, such as those relating to the specification of the CO2 quality for transport, have been introduced in Chapter 12 and will be developed further in the context of their implications for the design and operation of a CO2 transport infrastructure.

However, the development of a general framework for social LCA is still at an early stage of development. The aims of this paper are to systematically discuss general considerations regarding social LCA, to build a consistent and operationalized framework for a number of indicators and to test the framework through application on a case study.MethodsThe first step was to define the scope of the framework starting from a comprehensive review of concepts of social sustainability and social well-being, focusing on the conditions potentially affected by large-scale introduction of novel technologies. Secondly, main areas of concern for social well-being were defined. This resulted in the identification of four main areas of concern. The third step was to make an inventory of potential social indicators and select a number of indicators that could make the framework operational. Additionally, factors for weighting and normalization were developed.Results and discussionThe framework developed in this paper is based on four categories and 11 indicators and follows a life-cycle perspective. Six of the indicators are quantitative and are assessed using an input-output model linked to databases from the International Labour Organization. The remaining five indicators are qualitative indicators which are mapped using expert elicitation and a literature review. Identified concerns regarding the qualitative indicators are \u201cflagged\u201d and provided alongside the results of the quantitative assessment, which are aggregated into one single score by means of a weighted and normalized arithmetical mean. The paper illustrates the application of the methodology in a case study examining the deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies in Europe.ConclusionsThe paper presents a framework that can be used to explore potential impacts on social well-being resulting from the large-scale implementation of novel technologies. The selection of a limited number of indicators (11) keeps the methodology simple and transparent. Although the framework provides a useful approach in allowing both quantitative or qualitative identification of potential areas of concern, the results remain highly explorative in nature. The inherent value-laden and context specific nature of social aspects remains one of the key challenges for developing a general applicable framework.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "bf2582b331d12af51acb2662f16ca2fff1b0c67d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2552607782", "CorpusId": 99434552}, "title": "Hybrid mesoporous materials for carbon dioxide separation", "abstract": "Introduction Gas separation processes are becoming increasingly important in a world changing the way it looks at energy production and its emissions. Increased energy demand has led to an increase of fossil fuel burning, releasing large amounts of gases such as CO2 into the atmosphere. This is the major cause of several environmental phenomena, including the \u2018greenhouse effect\u2019. Methods for long-term sequestration of CO2 have been proposed. Long term storage in used oil wells and deep ocean waters is being considered as an alternative to releasing CO2 into the atmosphere. There are also proposals to re-use CO2 produced from one process in another process such as dry reforming of natural gas. However, such applications would require CO2 to be \u2018captured\u2019 in concentrated form. One common method for CO2 separation from mixed gas streams is by absorption in aqueous solutions of alkanolamines, for example monoethanolamine (MEA) or diethanolamine (DEA). It is widely accepted that CO2 becomes absorbed via the formation of both carbamates and bicarbonates. However, some of the problems associated with this absorption approach include: (a) the corrosive nature of the scrubbing solutions leading to the build up of corrosion by products; (b) vapourisation losses due to relatively high volatility of alkanolamines; and (c) energy intensive regeneration of the absorbent solutions, due to high heats of dissolution. A recent report by Leal et al indicated that CO2 reversibly adsorbs on silica gel (Davidson grade 62) modified by the addition of 3-aminopropyl groups bonded to the surface. In this solid phase analogue of the liquid phase process the amine functional groups behave as active sites for CO2 chemisorption. Adsorption capacities of approximately 10 STP cm3 dry CO2 per gram of adsorbent (or 1.8% by weight) were achieved at room temperature and the CO2 could be desorbed at temperatures below 100oC. The mechanism of adsorption appears to involve the formation of surface bound carbamates (see Figure 1). In dry CO2, this limits the adsorption capacity to 1 mole of CO2 for every 2 moles of surface bound amino groups. In the presence of water, however, the capacity for CO2 adsorption doubles since the possibility for proton transfer allows the carbon dioxide adsorption capacity to be doubled by the transformation of surface bound carbamate into bicarbonate.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "422d03c8b2da163f46f44d4daefb3ed10dbe50ff", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2057146286", "DOI": "10.1163/187601007x00316", "CorpusId": 154288144}, "title": "Geosequestration in Australia: Existing and Proposed Regulatory Mechanisms", "abstract": "Geosequestration involves the capture (from power stations and other facilities) and storage of carbon dioxide for very long periods of time in underground geological formations.

The concept of post-combustion capture is based on the selective chemical absorption of carbon dioxide (CO2). The highly concentrated CO2 stream that is suitable for storage is generated by heat-induced regeneration of the solvent. \nIn this work, ammonia is evaluated as an absorbent of CO2 in post-combustion capture processes. The major goals of this thesis are to define favorable applications and local conditions for ammonia-based post-combustion capture processes. The current benchmarking absorbent, monoethanolamine (MEA), has inherent problems is associated with specific drawbacks, such as a high heat requirement for regeneration and a tendency to undergo degradation during operation. Several novel absorbents, including ammonia, have been proposed as being superior to MEA in these aspects. The major disadvantage of ammonia is its volatility, which results in loss of absorbent (slip).\nThis thesis reveals the results of experimental, technical and economic performance analyses. To evaluate the capture process, validation of thermodynamic models of the NH3-CO2-H2O system is required. These thermodynamic models rely on a comprehensive experimental data on the solid-liquid-gas equilibrium for all operating conditions. This work presents new gas-liquid equilibrium data for temperatures that are relevant to the absorber (<25\u00b0C), which is an operating range of no prior industrial interest. This work presents the results of simulations of the absorption, desorption and ammonia recovery processes, for both the individual component level and the aggregated capture cycle. The performance of ammonia-based post-combustion capture is evaluated under various operational and local conditions. The design of a full-scale, ammonia-based capture process is described and the cost of capture is estimated for this process integrated with a coal-fired power plant. Special attention is focused on the design of the absorber system. In this thesis, a dual absorber with intermediate cooling is proposed as an essential measure to reduce ammonia slip. Preferable operating conditions for the absorber system are defined as: lean and rich CO2 loadings of 0.25 and 0.50, respectively; and a concentration of ammonia (CO2-free) of 14.3wt%.\nThe thesis concludes that ammonia-based absorbents represent a feasible alternative to the first- and second-generation absorbents for post-combustion capture of CO2. The specific total heat requirement for ammonia-based capture is calculated to be approximately 3,000 kJ/kg CO2. The most serious problem identified with respect to the ammonia process is the cost of reducing the ammonia slip to allowable levels. This concern limits the locations at which the present process could be implemented with commercial success. Successful application of ammonia-based post-combustion capture is expected to be achieved at locations that are characterized by access to low-temperature cooling water (~5\u00b0C) and a high concentration of CO2 (~15vol%).", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "bfd706e33eeb3dea88bfe29db54fccc8f8f22cd7", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 212543098}, "title": "Sequestration and storage of carbon by trees in and around University campus of Aurangabad city in Maharashtra, India", "abstract": "Trees from the urban regions currently store carbon, which can be released into the atmosphere after the death of tree, and capture carbon as they grow.

These effects on the cap-rock permeability and on the stress in the cap rock have been modelled by combining single-phase two-species convective\u2013diffusive flow with poro-elastic effects. We assume that the cap rock behaves as a poro-elastic, uniform and isotropic rock with two intermingled networks of macropores and of interlayer space between the clay layers. The empirical expressions for the chemical potentials and partial molar volumes of water and CO2 in the macropores and in the interlayer space have been derived from experimental data. With an emphasis on the physics underlying clay swelling, we have applied the model for uniaxial deformation in a cylindical symmetrical geometry. Considering that this geometry is, to some extent, only representative of the geometry at a reservoir edge, and that anisotropy, plasticity and a possible permeability increase when the stress in the rock is close to shear-type failure have not been included in this work and recognizing the present uncertainties in the experimental clay and shale data, the results are indicative. The model predicts that the stresses following CO2 adsorption in a smectite-containing cap rock are substantial at typical subsurface conditions for a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project. When the rock is under an unfavourable stress condition, local shear-type failure may occur in the cap rock exposed to CO2 over a period of 100\u201310 000 years, despite the fact that the permeability of the rock may reduce under the increasing compressive stress.

There are numerous methods being discussed, one of which is carbon dioxide capture and utilization (CCU). Carbon dioxide capture and utilization removes the carbon dioxide from the offgas streams and transforms it into commercial products, for example the conversion to value-added chemicals. While CCU is promising, especially as the commercial products provide an economic incentive, the sustainability needs to be ensured. Assuring the sustainability of carbon dioxide capture and utilization processes is a challenge as the energy requirements of result in indirect emissions that should not exceed the utilization. In this work, therefore, a framework for the sustainable design of carbon dioxide capture and utilization (with a focus on conversion) processes is developed and implemented. The developed framework adopts a 3-stage approach for sustainable design, which is comprised of: (1) synthesis, (2) design, and (3) innovation. In the first stage, the optimal processing route is obtained from a network via a superstructure-based approach. This stage incorporates a structured database for the storage and retrieval of data, reaction path synthesis for the generation of reaction pathways and products, and a user interface, Super-O, which facilitates the implementation of Stage 1 of the framework. Then, the output of this stage is used as the input to the second stage, where the optimal route is rigorously designed, simulated and analyzed. Stage 2 provides detailed equipment design and stream information, which is used in the analysis to provide targets for improvement.

The foam flowing through the cores showed higher apparent viscosity as the flow rate increased from low to medium and high velocities. At very high velocities, once foam bubbles were finely textured, the foam apparent viscosity was governed by foam rheology rather than foam creation. A noticeable hysteresis occurred when the flow velocity was initially increased and then decreased, implying multiple (coarse and strong) foam states at the same superficial velocity. A normalized generation function was combined with CMG-STARS foam model to cover full spectrum of foam behavior in the experiments. The new model successfully captures foam generation and hysteresis trends in presented experiments in this study and data from the literature.

More recently, the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce CO2\u00a0emissions has made CO2-based EOR increasingly attractive. Waterflooding is widely employed in China and, even after several years of water injection, considerable oil deposits remain in the thick, positive rhythm reservoirs in eastern China. The majority of these reservoirs may not be suitable for miscible CO2\u00a0flooding. The present work investigated immiscible CO2\u00a0flooding after waterflooding in such sites by laboratory trials. Series of large artificially-consolidated sandstone models with different levels of heterogeneity were used to simulate thick, positive rhythm oil reservoirs. Gaseous CO2\u00a0was continuously injected into these models at a constant injection pressure and an X-ray CT scanner (with a resolution of 0.7 \u00d7 0.7 mm) was used to monitor and record changes in the fluid saturation and migration. Based on the experimental results, it indicates that immiscible CO2\u00a0flooding following waterflooding is an efficient means of enhancing oil recovery. It is evident that both the reservoir heterogeneity and injection pressure differential affect oil recovery and CO2\u00a0distribution. The heterogeneity has a remarkable impact on oil recovery when the permeability differential between layers is lower than 2 millidarcy (md) or the permeability variation coefficient is less than 0.2. Fitting of the experimental results also demonstrates that there is an optimum pressure differential between inlet and outlet that maximizes oil recovery under specific inhomogeneous conditions.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "fb76c24c3f601e344eb7e2315c0bcfaba129933a", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.18178/ijesd.2016.7.8.849", "CorpusId": 209899606}, "title": "Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Potential of Mahogany ( Swietenia macrophylla ) Saplings", "abstract": "In the light of increasing fears about climate change, green house gas mitigation is one of the today\u2019s major concerns.

The ability to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in wetlands at ecologically relevant scales is complicated by the spatial variability inherent to patterns in wetland vegetation and the biogeomorphic processes that help create them. Remote sensing provides an approach for mapping wetland biomass, but the spatial resolutions of satellite and airborne imagery often constrain the types of ecological patterns and processes that can be detected. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have previously been used to capture fine\u2010scale (\u22641 m) variability in AGB in coastal wetland settings. However, it remains unclear if a UAV approach to estimating wetland biomass is transferrable across diverse wetland sites or how it compares to commonly used satellite\u2010based approaches. Here, we test the capabilities of UAVs in remotely quantifying AGB and compare biomass estimation using UAV and Landsat satellite imagery (30 m resolution) in several wetland sites in Southern California. Field surveys highlight significant spatial variability in wetland plant community AGB and height that influence remote biomass estimation. Relationships between UAV vegetation indices and AGB were site\u2010specific and influenced by vegetation types. Biomass estimation using UAVs (r2 = 0.40, RMSE = 534.6 g m\u22122) showed better correlation with NDVI than a Landsat\u2010based approach (r2 = 0.26, RMSE = 596.8 g m\u22122).

Overall, UAVs captured more spatial complexity in aboveground biomass at finer scales than is possible with moderate\u2010resolution Landsat pixels, indicating that UAVs can be used to characterize patterns of within\u2010marsh variability resulting from local\u2010scale (\u2264 100s of meters) ecological processes.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "6869b8856247cf8b2362d77e4c94f7fa71832541", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2784755426", "CorpusId": 169119101}, "title": "Can technology unlock unburnable carbon", "abstract": "In 2015, the Conference Of the Parties in Paris (COP21) reached a universal agreement on climate change with the aim of limiting global warming further to below 2\u00b0 C.

Meeting this target on a global scale is challenging and will require prompt and effective climate change mitigation action. But how much carbon can be emitted if we want to stay below two degrees and how can technology help us? Several recent reports have highlighted the scale of the challenge, drawing on scenarios of climate change mitigation and their implications for the projected consumption of fossil fuels. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a critical and available mitigation opportunity that is often overlooked. The positive contribution of this technology to timely and cost-effective de-carbonization of the energy system is widely recognised.

A main mover was the Labor Party politician Gro Harlem Brundtland who did not want to deal with unruly and highly vocal Deep Ecologists. Better then to start afresh with a different set of environmental scholars appealing to the technocratic tradition within the Labor Party. Instead of changing the ethical and social ways of dealing with environmental problems as the Deep Ecologists were advocating, she was looking for technological and economic solutions. And she mobilized an international regime of carbon capture storage (CCS), tradable carbon emissions quota (TEQs), and clean development mechanisms (CDMs), all of which eventually were approved in Kyoto in 1997. This move towards technocracy and cost-benefit economics reflects a post-Cold War turn towards utilitarian capitalism, but also a longing to showcase Norway as an environmental pioneer country to the world. The underlying question was how to reconcile the nation\u2019s booming petroleum industry with reduction in climate gas emissions. Should the oil and gas stay underground and the country strive towards the ecologically informed zerogrowth society the Deep Ecologists were envisioning?

Both models have been designed for modelling the mid- and long-term development of the energy system. The paper briefly describes the PRIMES and TIMES methodology explaining both the similarities and differences of approaches in relation to modelling the power supply. Four scenarios were analysed in this study: (i) PRIMES-REF, (ii) TSAP-REF, (iii) TIMES-REF, (iv) TIMES-NUC. Although these scenarios were elaborated with the use of different modelling tools there are many analogies in the evolution of the Polish power system up to 2050. As a consequence of EU climate policy and rising carbon prices within the European Union's Emissions Trading System (ETS) we observe a fuel and technology switch towards less carbon intensive options in all scenarios. The comparison is most adequate with PRIMES-REF and TIMES-NUC due to them having the best match in modelling assumptions and input parameters. In both, electricity generation from solid fuel declines throughout the projection period. This decline is more sharp before 2030 and stabilises thereafter. The relative share of fuels in the electricity generation mix by 2050 is not much different in both scenarios. Solid fuels constitute more than 45 %. The biggest differences were found in gas, nuclear, wind and solar. The differences for nuclear, wind and solar can be explained by the system-wide constraints applied in TIMES-PL. Increased use of gas in PRIMES-REF is presumably more of a methodological nature. CO 2 emissions have a similar, decreasing trend reaching ca. 45 Mt in 2050. In both scenarios ca. 39 % of electricity generated in thermal power plants in 2050 comes from units equipped with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).

Although the storage of CO2 is considered as safe, leakage to the atmosphere is an important concern and monitoring is necessary. Detecting and quantifying leaks of CO2 in the atmosphere is, however, difficult due to the rapid mixing of the emitted CO2 with the surroundings and the high natural variability of the CO2 concentration. In this thesis we present two leak detection strategies. The first uses multiple simple CO2 sensors that are placed in close proximity to each other. Although the variability of atmospheric CO2 is high in time, it is low in space. The sensors will all measure the same concentration unless there is a source of CO2 in the area under investigation. The second technique is much more sophisticated: it combines highly precise atmospheric oxygen (O2) measurements with atmospheric CO2 measurements. Sources and sinks of CO2 and O2 are \u2013inversely- coupled in almost all processes on earth (e.g. photosynthesis and fossil fuel burning) but not in case of a CO2 leak.

In this manner, South Korea is developing a one-million-ton-scale offshore CCS project to reduce national greenhouse gas emission, entitled the Korea Clean Carbon Storage Project (KCCS) 2025. In this project, the CO2 is captured from power plants on coast, loaded to CO2 carriers, and transported to an intermediate storage terminal, which is located on shoreline nearby offshore storage reservoirs at the Ulleung Basin. Then the CO2 is exported via an offshore pipeline to offshore platform for injection to geological storage site for a permanent containment. Since the concept of the KCCS 2025 includes CO2 carriers as a transportation method, it requires an intermediate storage terminal that receives the CO2 from carrier and send out continuous CO2 flow to the offshore pipeline after the pressurization of CO2 to higher than 100 bar. The intermediate storage terminal will consist of (1) unloading system, (2) CO2 storage tanks, (3) LP pumps, (4) a reliquefaction package, (5) a vent stack and (6) HP pump and injection pump (a booster station). Because there are few actual projects with an intermediate storage terminal worldwide, researches on intermediate storage facilities are insufficient. To support an optimal concept design of the intermediate storage terminal for the KCCS 2025, this study identified the potential hazardous events for the unloading system and the CO2 storage tanks. For the unloading system, an unloading arm and LCO2 recirculating line are found to be major components causing serious damage in case of accident. In the case of the CO2 storage tanks, where large amounts of CO2 are stored, they can cause serious damage due to large amounts of CO2 leakage when the tanks are ruptured, over-pressurized, low-pressurized, overcharged, etc. Because hazardous events may pose significant harm to humans or the environment, these results should be considered in the next phases of the project.

In this paper, an assumed blowout of a wellbore was examined for China\u2019s Shenhua CCS demonstration project. The significant factors that influenced the diffusion of CO2 were identified by using a response surface method with the Box-Behnken experiment design. The numerical simulations showed that the mass emission rate of CO2 from the source and the ambient wind speed have significant influence on the area of interest (the area of high CO2 concentration above 30,000\u00a0ppm). There is a strong positive correlation between the mass emission rate and the area of interest, but there is a strong negative correlation between the ambient wind speed and the area of interest. Several other variables have very little influence on the area of interest, e.g., the temperature of CO2, ambient temperature, relative humidity, and stability class values. Due to the weather conditions at the Shenhua CCS demonstration site at the time of the modeled CO2 blowout, the largest diffusion distance of CO2 in the downwind direction did not exceed 200\u00a0m along the centerline. When the ambient wind speed is in the range of 0.1\u20132.0\u00a0m/s and the mass emission rate is in the range of 60\u2013120\u00a0kg/s, the range of the diffusion of CO2 is at the most dangerous level (i.e., almost all Grade Four marks in the risk matrix). Therefore, if the injection of CO2 takes place in a region that has relatively low perennial wind speed, special attention should be paid to the formulation of pre-planned, emergency measures in case there is a leakage accident.

The calculations were performed for different oil shale heating values and different recycled flue gas (RFG) ratios. Oxy-fuel combustion with flue gas recycling was found to enable the decrease of the extent of carbonate minerals decomposition (ECD), thereby increasing the amount of heat released per 1 kg of fuel.

It also provides forest managers and policy makers with an easy-to-use tool for examining the relative merit (C credit revenue vs. project cost) of C offset projects and forest sector life cycle GHG accounting. GHG accounts include: 1) storage in aboveground and belowground live biomass and dead organic matter components; 2) storage in forest products in use and in landfill; 3) forest sector emissions by harvest, transport, and mills, or avoided emissions (substitution, bioenergy); as well as 4) landfill methane release and avoided emissions from methane energy capture. Different forest and forest product pools can be included in result summaries to reflect different C accounting guidelines (e.g., Climate Action Reserve, Voluntary Carbon Standard). Results can be compared for baseline and C offset project scenarios. Where possible, the marginal differences between baseline and project scenario performance indicators are calculated. All forest-level emission or storage measures are expressed in tonnes of CO2 equivalents for comparison purposes. Finally, economic indicators such as net present value and benefit-cost ratios for C offset projects can be evaluated using alternative assumptions for the value of stumpage, C credits, and offset project costs. The user enters their own inventory of stand type area by treatment regime data for baseline and offset project scenarios and can quickly adjust many GHG accounting parameters.

A major risk associated with geosequestration is a possible leakage of CO2 from the storage formation into overlaying formations. To mitigate this risk, the deployment of carbon capture and storage projects requires fast and reliable detection of relatively small volumes of CO2 outside the storage formation. To do this, it is necessary to predict typical seepage scenarios and improve subsurface seepage detection methods. In this work we present a technique for CO2 monitoring based on the detection of diffracted waves in time\u2010lapse seismic data. In the case of CO2 seepage, the migrating plume might form small secondary accumulations that would produce diffracted, rather than reflected waves. From time\u2010lapse data analysis, we are able to separate the diffracted waves from the predominant reflections in order to image the small CO2 plumes. To explore possibilities to detect relatively small amounts of CO2, we performed synthetic time\u2010lapse seismic modelling based on the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC) Otway project data. The detection method is based on defining the CO2 location by measuring the coherency of the signal along diffraction offset\u2010traveltime curves. The technique is applied to a time\u2010lapse stacked section using a stacking velocity to construct offset\u2010traveltime curves. Given the amount of noise found in the surface seismic data, the predicted minimum detectable amount of CO2 is 1000\u20132000 tonnes. This method was also applied to real data obtained from a time\u2010lapse seismic physical model. The use of diffractions rather than reflections for monitoring small amounts of CO2 can enhance the capability of subsurface monitoring in CO2 geosequestration projects.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "679c103c3102ebd41c7b0684962339756e280bd9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2060447577", "DOI": "10.1080/00103624.2014.988583", "CorpusId": 98706890}, "title": "Carbon Sequestration in Kiwifruit Orchard Soils at Depth to Mitigate Carbon Emissions", "abstract": "Management practices designed to increase carbon sequestration via perennial tree crops are potential tools to mitigate the consequences of climate change. Changes in orchard management could enable growers to meet eco-verification market demands for products with a low carbon footprint and potentially exploit the emerging business opportunity in carbon storage, while enhancing the delivery of ecosystem services that depend on soil carbon stocks. However, there is no standard methodology to verify any potential claims of carbon storage by perennial vine crops. We developed a robust methodology to quantify carbon storage in kiwifruit orchards. Soil carbon stocks (SCS) were determined in six depth increments to 1 m deep in two adjacent kiwifruit blocks, which had been established 10 (\u201cyoung\u201d) and 25 (\u201cold\u201d) years earlier. We used a space-for-time analysis. Our key results were the young and old kiwifruit block stored about 139 and 145 t C/ha to 1 m depth. Between 80\u201390 percent of the SCS were stored in the top 0.5 m, and 89\u201395 percent in the top 0.7 m; there was no significant difference between the SCS in row and alley to a depth of 0.5 m; a CV of 5\u201315 percent indicates that 4\u201310 cores are needed for 80 percent confidence in the estimated SCS; we recommend separating each core into the depths 0\u20130.1, 0.1\u20130.3, 0.3\u20130.5, and 0.5\u20131 m to allow the assessment of SCS dynamics; we detected a weak spatial pattern of the SCS only for the old kiwifruit block with a range of about 3 m. A sampling bay along a vine row should have a maximum length of 3 m. We then assessed SCS in more than sixty kiwifruit orchards throughout New Zealand. They stored on average 174.9 \u00b1 3 t C ha\u22121 to 1 m depth. On average, 51 percent of the SCS down to 1 m depth were stored in the top 0.3 m, which is the standard depth according to the Kyoto protocol. About 72 percent of the SCS to 1 m depth were captured when increasing the sampling depth to 0.5 m. These results underscore the necessity to analyze SCS in an orchard to at least 0.5 m deep. Using the same methodology to 1 m deep, we determined SCS in two wine grape vineyards on shallow, stony alluvial soils. We found a difference between vineyard and adjacent pasture SCS of nearly 16 t/ha. As the vines are 25 years old, this equates to carbon sequestration rates of 640 kg ha\u22121 yr\u22121. Our results of the space-for-time analysis also showed that all sequestration had occurred below 0.5 m. Therefore, we decided to sample C to a greater depth. In a 30-year old kiwifruit orchard and an adjacent pasture, SCS was measured to 9 m deep. In the kiwifruit orchard, we found a sequestration rate of 6.3 tons of C per hectare per year greater than in the adjacent pasture that was the antecedent land use.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "5d06f1a4af8222f137f29c397ef7fa116a5b9a39", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2952063663", "DOI": "10.1021/ACSSUSCHEMENG.9B00167", "CorpusId": 197271617}, "title": "Promoting Discarded Packing Waste into Value-Added 2D Porous Carbon Flakes for Multifunctional Applications", "abstract": "In this work, a prolific reuse of waste foam peanuts into eco-benign and cost-effective two-dimensional (2D) activated carbon nanoflakes (CFs) was presented for use in CO2 capture and supercapacitor applications.

This review builds on the comprehensive review of CCS technologies published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2005. The review has therefore focussed on new developments that have arisen from 2006 to the present. The bulk of the review is dedicated to capture technology as this has the greatest diversity of technologies and is the most expensive part of a CCS system in terms of energy, capital and operating costs. This review has considered four configurations for capture of carbon dioxide; postcombustion, pre-combustion, oxy-fuel and chemical looping technology. The postand precombustion technologies both require the separation of carbon dioxide from gas streams with the pre-combustion streams generally having higher carbon dioxide concentrations. The separation technologies can be broadly categorised as sorption and membrane processes with some technologies spanning both categories. The state of the art technology for post-combustion capture is the amine-based absorption process, which is unchanged from the IPCC review. There have been advances in aminebased technologies that have reduced the energy penalties and improved performance but these systems are still not economically viable with the current cost of carbon dioxide emissions. Two competing absorption processes based on ammonia and carbonate solutions have been further developed and may offer a more viable option in the near future. In the longer term solid sorbents and membrane systems are expected to offer better efficiencies and economics while ionic liquids, metal organic frameworks, facilitated transport membranes and biological processes may also have potential. The state of the art for pre-combustion capture is also unchanged from the IPCC review, with physical solvent systems such as Selexol and Rectisol the only commercially available options. Research and development of these systems is expected to provide incremental improvements in efficiency and selectivity but it is expected that membrane systems will become dominant in the future. Solid sorbents may also play a role in improving the efficiency of pre-combustion systems utilising water gas shift reactions. Cryogenic separation is still the state of the art technology for oxy-fuel systems but membrane separation processes have advanced considerably since the IPCC report and are expected to be available commercially in the near future. These processes will dramatically reduce the energy intensity of air separation and render cryogenic separation obsolete for oxy-fuel purposes. There is also a suggestion that these membrane systems can improve the efficiency of NGCC plants. Chemical looping technology has advanced since the IPCC review but is still only at the experimental stage and is therefore only a potential long term option. The avoidance cost of capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) is NZ$60-90 for the state of the art systems. GNS Science Report 2009/62 iii The transport and injection of carbon dioxide is mature technology with the transport in New Zealand expected to be by pipeline. The cost of both of these components is very dependent on distance between source and sink and the properties of the sink.

The three steps of this technology are (i) capturing large-scale CO2 emissions produced by industrial activities using fossil fuels (coal-fired power plants, factories, steelworks, refineries), by post or pre-combustion methods, (ii) transporting the captured CO2 to a storage site through pipelines, (iii) storing the CO2 deep underground. Potential underground storage targets are (i) deep saline aquifers containing a high concentration of dissolved salts, (ii) depleted oil and gas fields (abandoned or used to perform Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) or Enhanced Gas Recovery (EGR)), (iii) coal seams, used to perform Enhanced Coal Bed Methane recovery (ECBM). Another possible solution for CO2 storage would be to chemically fix CO2 into the carbonated minerals in mafic and ultramafic rocks. Other geological media proposed as storage for CO2 are oil or gas rich shales, salt caverns and abandoned mines (IPCC, 2005). According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), CCS could contribute up to 19% in the reduction of global emissions in 2050. Measuring Monitoring and Verification (MMV) is an important part of each CCS project.

In this chapter, we focus particularly on geochemical methods, and discuss their assets and relevance in monitoring CO2 geological storage sites. At first, a classification is proposed based on a literature review. The role of geochemical methods to identify fluids sources and physicochemical processes is explained, and some examples of applications to deep geological CO2 storage monitoring are described.

If the CCS system has a continuous operation, the conventional power plant has a smaller capacity to compensate RES. Admitting a discharge of the CO2 emissions into the atmosphere only for the periods when power injected by RES is very low (under 30 % of the installed power for our example) CCS might also be regarded as an important method for the integration of RES.

Therefore, all addressed issues must be clarified and proved to be feasible deployment for the commercial scale CCS plants to cope with emission targets according to Copenhagen Accord to reduce GHG emission and mitigate world temperature rising.\r\n\r\n\r\nKeywords:\r\n\r\noxyfuel combustion;\r\nCO2 capture;\r\nair separation;\r\nflue gas recycle;\r\ngreenhouse gases;\r\nsteam cycle;\r\ncombined cycle", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "9302117745a49a45be022864ca6e9e9f1ede7670", "externalIds": {"MAG": "19517593", "DOI": "10.1016/B978-008044704-9/50096-3", "CorpusId": 108214149}, "title": "Important accounting issues for carbon dioxide capture and storage projects under the UNFCCC", "abstract": null, "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "9356a2fa77f58be0f292120976bd74188d696062", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3389/fclim.2021.643224", "CorpusId": 233433040}, "title": "Boundary Work and Interpretations in the IPCC Review Process of the Role of Bioenergy With Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) in Limiting Global Warming to 1.5\u00b0C", "abstract": "Paris Agreement-compatible emissions pathways produced by integrated assessment models (IAMs) often rely on large amounts of carbon dioxide removals, especially afforestation and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). These pathways feature prominently in the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to the extent that the IAMs have been granted an interpretative privilege at the interface between climate science, economics, and policymaking. The privilege extends to and influences climate governance, including governance of BECCS. This paper contributes to recent debates about the role of the IPCC, and its framing of BECCS, at the science-policy interface. By analyzing all BECCS-related expert review comments and author responses on the IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5\u00b0C, the paper shows that boundary work influences the representation of BECCS by authors referring to: (1) a limited scope or capacity; (2) a restrictive mandate; (3) what constitutes legitimate science, and; (4) relativizing uncertainties. The responses to the review comments indicate a significant degree of compliance on behalf of the authors. Yet, the revisions do not seem to go to the heart of the unease that runs through many of the reviewer comments, i.e., that BECCS seems to be presented as a viable CDR technology at grand scale. While several revisions serve to clarify uncertainties surrounding BECCS, some fundamental aspects of the critique are deflected, through the boundary work identified. What the analysis reveals, beyond a dissatisfaction among many reviewers with the focus on integrated assessment modeling, the associated pathway literature, and analysis of BECCS, is a disagreement about how model results should be interpreted and communicated. While acknowledging the herculean task of the IPCC and the efforts to improve the pathway literature that the SR1.5 triggered within the IAM communities, we argue that the identified boundary work also risks entrenching rather than problematize dominant framings of the feasibility of BECCS. Such entrenchment can counteract the ambition of opening up the scientific work of the IPCC to include more diversity in the process of drafting reports, and arguably also influence the governance of CDR.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "95a6d306d3ac39ccf7bdc373d1618640384a98f7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2784190019", "DBLP": "conf/wsc/SinghamC17", "DOI": "10.1109/WSC.2017.8247935", "CorpusId": 4560620}, "title": "Sample average approximations for the continuous type principal-agent problem: An example", "abstract": "Principal-agent problems study contracts for goods or services that a principal (seller) should offer an agent (buyer).

To do this, the world must achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. Currently spreading wealth and health across the globe is dependent on growing the GDP of all countries, driven by the use of energy, which until recently has mostly been derived from fossil fuel. Recently, some countries have decoupled their GDP growth and greenhouse gas emissions through a rapid increase in low carbon energy generation. Considering the current level of energy consumption and projected implementation rates of low carbon energy production, a considerable quantity of fossil fuels is projected to be used to fill the gap, and to avoid emissions of GHG and close the gap between the 1.5\u00b0C carbon budget and projected emissions, carbon capture and storage (CCS) on an industrial scale will be required. In addition, the IPCC estimate that large-scale GHG removal from the atmosphere is required to limit warming to below 2\u00b0C using technologies such as Bioenergy CCS and direct carbon capture with CCS to achieve climate safety. In this paper, we estimate the amount of carbon dioxide that will have to be captured and stored, the storage volume, technology, and infrastructure required to achieve the energy consumption projections with net zero GHG emissions by 2050. We conclude that the oil and gas production industry alone has the geological and engineering expertise and global reach to find the geological storage structures and build the facilities, pipelines, and wells required.

The deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and potentially CO2 utilization (CCU) technologies are needed to limit climate change. These technologies aim to capture CO2 from power and industrial processes and store the CO2 long term or utilize the CO2 into useable products. Integrating CCS with the use of biomass (BioCCS) can be particularly interesting, as in total CO2 can be removed from the atmosphere, and is considered necessary for ambitious climate change mitigation targets. CCS and CCU can reduce CO2 emissions, but often leads to an increase in other environmental impacts as a result of (fossil) energy needed for capturing, transporting and utilizing the CO2. It is important to understand the environmental trade-offs between climate change mitigation and other environmental impacts when considering the deployment of CCS and CCU technologies. This thesis focusses on three areas that are increasingly gaining attention, i.e.: the impact of CCS on water availability, the effect of different types of biomass on the environmental trade-offs of BioCCS, and environmental impacts of CO2 utilization. The impact of CCS on water availability is studied on both a process and system level. Life cycle assessment (LCA) studies are carried out for different case studies (power plant and industry) that include the water depletion potential of the instalment of CCS. The results show that the deployment of CCS can substantially increase the water depletion potential of a process, as a result of increased water use on site for cooling and CO2 capture processes, and a rise in water use caused by the production of additional fuel. A system level analysis highlight that equipping a large part of European power plants with CCS in 2050 can significantly increase regional water stress levels across Europe. The environmental impact of BioCCS is analysed at power plant level and on a life cycle basis. Results show that the integration of biomass use to CCS further increases the climate change mitigation potential of CCS. Changes in impacts in other categories are limited, although replacing coal by biomass can also lower for example toxicity and eutrophication impacts. The environmental performance of a specific CO2 utilization route (CO2 conversion into DME) is analysed in this thesis. Results indicate that the environmental performance improvement of this option is limited, but also highlight limitations in CCU performance assessment of existing indicators. Therefore, a new indicator, the Specific Primary Energy Consumption per unit of Fossil Fuel Replacement (SPECFER), is introduced. This indicator measures the energy efficiency of CO2 conversion and allows to evaluate and compare the performance of CCU options with different functionalities.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "32c0ab2e449cca5ac7aa5c8704e0fe15493e75a8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2441256503", "CorpusId": 55819816}, "title": "A Step towards Sustainable Society: The Awareness of Carbon Dioxide Emissions, Climate Change and Carbon Capture in Malaysia", "abstract": "Public awareness is crucial to mitigate negative impacts on the environment. The aim of the study is to explore the level of public awareness in five states of Malaysia (Perak, Melaka, Johor, Pahang and Terengganu) regarding CO2 emissions, climate change and carbon capture and storage (CCS). A questionnaire floated for exploring public awareness regarding CO2 emissions, climate change and CCS. Based on the questionnaire data was collected from five states (Perak, Melaka, Johor, Pahang and Terengganu) of Malaysia. These states were chosen on the basis of high concentration of heavy industries and plants, including petrochemical, natural gas processing, electricity generating, and cement plants. The study found that the public awareness of CO2 emissions and climate change is high as compared to the level of awareness towards CCS, because some of the respondents have never/ not heard about CCS. Furthermore, the study revealed that the respondents have several misperceptions about CO2 emissions, climate change and CCS. Most of them only heard about CO2 emissions, climate change and CCS only through print, electronic and social media. This study investigated public awareness about CO2 emissions, climate change and CCS only in 5 states of Malaysia; however, in future the study could be extended and explored in all states of Malaysia. The findings offer significant implications for environmental policies and strategies in curbing the negative environmental impacts of CO2 emissions in Malaysia as a whole.

The concept is built on the perspective that it would be hard to reduce drastically the future anthropogenic CO2 emissions with our continued reliance to fossil fuel energy sources. Actually, with an existing scrubbing method to treat the flue gases of fuel-burning power plants, fossil fuel CO2 can be concentrated and liquefied with a rough cost estimate of 5000 JPY per tonne of CO2. It should be noted that there is no technical barrier envisioned for the implementation of this option either in dissolving CO2 in the mid-water of the ocean or placing it on the oceanic floor (Ohsumi, 2003). In a large employment of this technology, the cost of transport and injection of CO2 into the sea is less than 2000JPY per tonne of CO2. After all, with the expenditure equivalent to 0.1% of GDP, Japanese CO2 emission could be reduced by several percents. With this technical and economical feasibility taken into account, our urgent mission is to examine the biological consequence of CO2 stored in the ocean. The ocean sequestration option could be considered as one of the global warming mitigation measures through carbon management activity. In the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, we have developed schemes for carbon management in pursuit of the attainment of the Convention\u2019s ultimate purpose, i.e. the stabilization of the atmospheric concentration of greenhouse gases. Enhancement of terrestrial sinks of atmospheric CO2 by forestry management, and controlled change of land use is a successful example of the efforts through the processes of IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change).

Achieving sufficiently high net CO2 removal will require upscaling of basalt mining, deploying systems in remote areas with a low carbon footprint and using energy from low-carbon sources. We argue that basalt soil amendment should be considered a prominent option when assessing land management options for mitigating climate change, but yet unknown side-effects, as well as limited data on field-scale deployment, need to be addressed first. The enhanced CO2 uptake by vegetation in response to powdered rock should be considered in assessing the feasibility of enhanced weathering as a negative emission technology in mitigating climate change, suggest simulations of a land surface model.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "093a51cc76d021925b69470699f746ae7f9729c2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2999871230", "DOI": "10.1002/ghg.1944", "CorpusId": 213263259}, "title": "Assessment of CO\n 2\n \u2010enhanced oil recovery and associated geologic storage potential in the Michigan Northern Pinnacle Reef Trend", "abstract": "This paper provides an improved estimate of CO2\u2010EOR (where CO2 is carbon dioxide and EOR is enhanced oil recovery) and CO2 storage potential for depleted oil fields in Michigan's northern pinnacle reef trend (NPRT). Our methodology is based on capturing data on reservoir performance from reefs currently undergoing CO2\u2010EOR operations in the NPRT (referred to as \u2018monitored reefs\u2019), and then applying them to other reefs within the NPRT (referred to as \u2018catalog reefs\u2019). For each monitored reef, we calculate fractional primary recovery, fractional incremental EOR recovery, net utilization ratio, and storage efficiency factor. The corresponding incremental oil recovery from EOR, storage capacity until end of EOR, and total CO2 injection needs are then estimated for each catalog reef and combined (over all monitored reefs) using a weighted averaging procedure. These weights are related to a statistical similarity measure that is calculated between each monitored reef and each catalog reef based on a number of variables related to production data, formation type, or descriptive geologic attributes. For the entire NPRT catalog of 383 reefs as used in this study, our results indicate 118 million (MM) stock tank barrels (STB) (1.88 \u00d7 107 Sm3) of incremental oil from EOR operations, corresponding to 49 MM metric tons (MT) of CO2 storage and 266 MM MT of total CO2 injection. However, approximately one\u2010third of the reefs provide two\u2010thirds of the potential for CO2\u2010EOR and geologic storage, assuming an economic threshold of 0.5 MM STB (80 000 Sm3) of incremental oil from EOR. \u00a9 2020 The Authors.
