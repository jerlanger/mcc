Renewable energies are becoming more prevalent, but are still a long way from being commonplace worldwide. Literature mining is applied to review carbon capture and storage (CCS) development trends and to develop and examine a novel carbon capture and storage technological paradigm (CCSTP), which incorporates CCSTP competition, diffusion and shift. This paper first provides an overview of the research and progress in CCS technological development, then applies a techno-paradigm theory to analyze CCSTP development and to provide a guide for future CCS technological trends. CCS could avoid CO 2 being released into the atmosphere. Moreover, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) can make a significant contribution to a net removal of anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. In this study, we compare the different CCSTP developmental paths and the conventional techno-paradigm by examining the S-curves. The analyses in this paper provide a useful guide for scholars seeking new inspiration in their research and for potential investors who are seeking to invest research funds in more mature technologies. We conclude that political barriers and public acceptance are the major distinctions between the CCSTP and the conventional techno-paradigm.

Lower Triassic sandstones are common in the UK and NW Europe and are being considered for future CCS projects. The caprock to these sandstones is the Middle and Upper Triassic Mercia Mudstone Group. We have studied the Mercia Mudstone using mineralogy, petrology and mercury injection porosimetry to assess its caprock quality. Detrital minerals are dominated by quartz, K-feldspar, illite and chlorite; diagenetic pore-filling minerals are dominated by calcite, dolomite and gypsum. In samples with abundant clay minerals, there are only small quantities of pore-filling diagenetic cements. Porosity is broadly uniform for both clay-rich and clay-poor samples. The cleaner (clay-poor) samples had their initial pore spaces filled with early diagenetic pore-filling carbonates and gypsum. Despite the broadly uniform porosity, mean pore throat diameter displays a strong inverse correlation with clay content whereas threshold capillary entry pressure shows a strong positive correlation with clay content. The more clay-rich samples represent much better caprock than the coarser-grained samples that contain abundant pore-filling cement. The samples could support potential column heights of supercritical CO2 between 70 and 540 m and have calculated permeabilities between 10\u221220 and 10\u221219 m2; leakage would occur only on geological time scales, assuming that these samples are representative of the whole caprock.

The increase in its energy and electricity demand is attributed to the growth of population, urbanization, and industrialization parallel to economic and social growth. Instead of fulfilling the obligation to protect the environment arising from international agreements and achieving desired sustainable development, the dependency on imported fossil fuel in electrical energy production and energy-intensive economic growth results in intensified CO2 emission as well as ironically negative economic output. Therefore, Turkey is forced to exploit its indigenous sources such as coal (which unfortunately increases atmospheric Green House Gas \u201cGHG\u201d emissions) and renewable resources. However, high GHG emission \u2013 mainly CO2 \u2013 of Turkey\u2019s coal power plants impairs deployment of indigenous sources for power generation. Indeed, there is a necessity of technical approaches for higher heat extraction efficiencies and mitigation of high concentration of energy-related CO2 emission. Admittedly, \u201cCarbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS)\u201d employing conventional hydrothermal resources offers highly efficient heat extraction, geological CO2 sequestration, and utilization of CO2 for power generation rather than considering CO2 as an effluent. Although there are research gaps and lack of field scale experiment, the economic and environmental viability of implementing CCUS in Turkey can be improved by pilot or field scale projects whereby the presence of these projects commences technological and experimental advances in capturing CO2 either from geothermal power plants or indigenous coal power plants, transporting it to the proven geothermal geologic site, and generating power. Apart from this, the \u201cCO2 \u2013 Plume Geothermal Systems (CPG)\u201d compared to unconventional and conventional geothermal systems would commit vigorous potential for continual improvement in economic feasibility of CCUS without a guaranteed return on power generation investments in Turkey.

Results for new baseload plants indicate a likely increase in levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of $20-32/MWh (constant 2007$) or $22-40/MWh in current dollars. A risk premium for plants with CCS increases these ranges to $23-39/MWh and $25-46/MWh, respectively. Based on current cost estimates, our analysis further shows that a policy to encourage CCS at new NGCC plants via an emission tax or carbon price requires (at 95% confidence) a price of at least $125/t CO(2) to ensure NGCC-CCS is cheaper than a plant without CCS.

For the experiment, 500 tons of CO2 from a natural CO2 reservoir was injected in supercritical state into the reservoir. The carbon stable isotope value (\u03b4(13)C) of injected CO2 was significantly different from background values. In order to observe the breakthrough of the isotope tracer continuously, the new instruments were connected to a stainless steel riser tube that was installed in an observation well. The laser instrument is based on tunable laser direct absorption in the mid-infrared. The instrument recorded a continuous 10 day carbon stable isotope data set with 30 min resolution directly on-site in a field-based laboratory container during a tracer experiment. To test the instruments performance and accuracy the monitoring campaign was accompanied by daily CO2 sampling for laboratory analyses with isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). The carbon stable isotope ratios measured by conventional IRMS technique and by the new mid-infrared laser spectrometer agree remarkably well within analytical precision. This proves the capability of the new mid-infrared direct absorption technique to measure high precision and accurate real-time stable isotope data directly in the field. The laser spectroscopy data revealed for the first time a prior to this experiment unknown, intensive dynamic with fast changing \u03b4(13)C values.

Despite this large potential, the costs of CCSM are currently too high for a large deployment of the technology and new systems are being investigated to attempt to overcome these limitations. To improve this situation, the successful development of post-processing routes creating marketable carbon neutral products could help the deployment of mineral carbonation. This work investigates the current market for CCSM products and the role they can play in decreasing the overall cost of CCSM technology. The current global market for the raw commodities, primarily cement additives, fillers and iron ore feedstock which could be produced by rock and/or industrial waste/by-product mineralisation, is about 27.5 Gt and can be easily flooded assuming 10% of the global CO2 emissions sequestered by CCSM. The CCSM technology chosen will play a very important role in the products created, available post-processing routes and accessible markets if the resultant materials are of high purity. Low-value applications such as fill for land reclamation may represent the only viable opportunity at the current state of the technology, bearing in mind that these materials are competing with low-cost materials (i.e. crushed rock) and that the size distribution of the carbonated materials may need significant alteration to make them potentially useful. However, there is a lack of information available on the quality of the CCSM products towards access to high-value markets such as micro-silica and PCC. In summary, CCSM post-processing might be viable only in niche high-value markets, while low-value applications such as land/mine reclamation are potentially more feasible and could be able to absorb Gts of CCSM products.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "909b52f302621e9ec133d217440e608b319b6de4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1101151460", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2015.06.012", "CorpusId": 93546956}, "title": "Biomass and carbon dioxide capture and storage: A review", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "55d98fe0113454f0c8c662e65350e62781fcd4d6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2046654931", "DOI": "10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2013.11.027", "CorpusId": 111095736}, "title": "Unified pinch approach for targeting of carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems with multiple time periods and regions", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "e424ab044c0e56504f41246ce5195f7b0ee55203", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2087178858", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENERGY.2014.04.007", "CorpusId": 110867720}, "title": "CCS (carbon capture and storage) investment possibility in South East Europe: A case study for Croatia", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "ff281ea3079e5c627dbd0f233eea04998cf9eef6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2083974340", "DOI": "10.1016/J.APENERGY.2014.01.080", "CorpusId": 110984772}, "title": "A unified model for the deployment of carbon capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "76229e4827d603a56c174d48e1d443e2f1502598", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2158304445", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2014.04.024", "CorpusId": 111320310}, "title": "Uncertainty in the deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): A sensitivity analysis to techno-economic parameter uncertainty", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "819e91e06eaf17f997beebc6d6204a3ebb2fd1ba", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2016704215", "DOI": "10.1016/J.IJGGC.2013.12.002", "CorpusId": 108579278}, "title": "Life cycle and cost assessment of mineral carbonation for carbon capture and storage in European power generation", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "a1f47f2a3e8b0d52e5d6c947ab1d6aa30b733a17", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "7307840", "MAG": "3003116063", "DOI": "10.1021/acsami.9b19955", "CorpusId": 210862395, "PubMed": "31961641"}, "title": "Multifunctional Carbon Aerogels with Hierarchical Anisotropic Structure Derived from Lignin and Cellulose Nanofibers for CO2 Capture and Energy Storage", "abstract": "In current times, CO2 capture and lightweight energy storage are receiving significant attention and will be vital functions in next-generation materials.

Conventional geological carbon capture and storage involves large capital outlay and recurring expense. Therefore there is increased interest in coupling biological carbon capture and sequestration with biomass production. Systems such as low\u2010input high\u2010diversity native grasslands and biochar production have been heralded as carbon negative biofuels. Another potential production system for bioenergy with biological carbon capture and storage (BEBCCS) is the large\u2010scale cultivation of seaweed (macroalgae) for biofuels. Marine biofuels offer considerable advantages over terrestrial first\u2010generation biofuels in terms of their low land use, fresh water and fertilizer requirements. In addition, they also offer considerable potential in the field of BEBCCS. Macroalgae rapidly accumulate biomass and as part of this process, a significant proportion (estimates range up to 60%) of the carbon they fix photosynthetically is released into the water. A proportion of this released dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is highly labile and enters the bacterial loop and is rapidly remineralized back to CO 2 . However, a proportion is known to be resistant to biological degradation and enters the refractory DOC pool. The marine DOC pool is the largest organic carbon pool on the planet and the refractory component is known to have a turnover period of 100s\u20101000s years. The release of refractory DOC from macroalgae combined with biofuel production offers the potential for large scale carbon negative fuel production. \u00a9 2012 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "76b3f7ad2920066c0e186273fd78601424ef3b71", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2327835339", "DOI": "10.1021/IE202821R", "CorpusId": 101294353}, "title": "Continuous-Time Optimization Model for Source\u2013Sink Matching in Carbon Capture and Storage Systems", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is widely considered to be an essential technology for reducing carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions from sources such as power plants.

In this work, a continuous-time mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model for CO 2 source-sink matching in CCS systems is developed; the initial model is then converted into an equivalent mixed integer linear program (MILP). It is assumed that in CCS systems, CO 2 sources have fixed flow rates and operating lives, while CO 2 sinks have an earliest time of availability and a maximum CO 2 storage capacity.

Inexpensive electricity from coal has been a key component in building large industrial economies such as USA and China. But in recent decades the negative aspects of coal, mainly carbon dioxide emissions, has changed the view on the fuel. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a solution to be able to continue using coal as an energy source, while limiting carbon emissions. One of the drawbacks of CCS is the energy need associated with the capture process, the energy penalty. This study aims to gather and analyze the energy penalties for the most developed types of carbon capture technologies. It also aims to model how the implementation of CCS would affect the future coal consumption.The results show that the range of energy penalties for a given type of technology is wide. Despite obtaining the energy penalty with the same simulation software, the energy penalty for post- combustion with MEA can range between 10.7% and 39.1%. Comparing mean energy penalties show that pre-combustion capture is the most efficient capture method (18.4% \u00b1 4.4%) followed by oxy- fuel (21.6% \u00b1 5.5%) and post-combustion (24.7% \u00b1 7.9%).Further on, CCS implementation scenarios were compared and used as a starting point for coal consumption calculations. Three pathways were constructed in order to investigate how different distributions of technologies would affect the amount of needed coal. The pathways describe a implementation with only the most efficient technology, the least efficient and a middle option.The results suggest that a large scale implementation of CCS on coal power plant will have a significant impact on the global coal consumption. Under certain assumptions it takes up to 35 % more coal to deliver the same amount electricity with CCS in comparison without CCS.

Recognition that there is a potentially suitable geosequestration site in the region near extensive emission sources led to the formation of the South West Hub and its submission as a potential Flagship under the Australian Federal Clean Energy Initiative (CEI). An area with geosequestration potential was identified based on data from years of active research in the region to investigate oil and gas potential, ground-water resources and more recently for geothermal energy potential and now carbon storage. Three interesting factors stand out regarding this site: (1) the storage site relies primarily on residual and dissolution trapping, (2) some of the CO2 will be sequestered by mineralisation during the amelioration of bauxite residue from some nearby alumina plants, and (3) the subsurface storage area can be tested at a relatively early stage by accessing significant pilot-scale quantities of high-purity CO2 from existing industry in the Kwinana area. CO2 is already being captured and vented at a site in Kwinana, and a proposed pipeline will transport the CO2 to the alumina plants with the remainder of the gas used for a pilot-scale test. The upfront capital costs are therefore reduced to the pipeline cost rather than for a full-scale capture-ready power plant. In preparation for an investment decision (to drill a new data well addressing the main criteria for characterising carbon storage potential of the proposed Lesueur site) a series of studies have increased the understanding of the geology of the area. Modelling studies suggest that up to 6.4 million tonnes per annum could be stored in the Triassic aged Lesueur Sandstone, with total capacity estimates of 200\u2013260 million tonnes of CO2 over the lifetime of the project.

Thermal power plants also account for 39% of all freshwater withdrawals in the U.S. To reduce GHG emissions from coal-fired plants, postcombustion carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems are receiving considerable attention. Current commercial amine-based capture systems require water for cooling and other operations that add to power plant water requirements. This paper characterizes and quantifies water use at coal-burning power plants with and without CCS and investigates key parameters that influence water consumption. Analytical models are presented to quantify water use for major unit operations. Case study results show that, for power plants with conventional wet cooling towers, approximately 80% of total plant water withdrawals and 86% of plant water consumption is for cooling. The addition of an amine-based CCS system would approximately double the consumptive water use of the plant. Replacing wet towers with air-cooled condensers for dry cooling would reduce plant water use by about 80% (without CCS) to about 40% (with CCS). However, the cooling system capital cost would approximately triple, although costs are highly dependent on site-specific characteristics. The potential for water use reductions with CCS is explored via sensitivity analyses of plant efficiency and other key design parameters that affect water resource management for the electric power industry.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "9ace8e00f1a9aa6262356b0f62236212250806f5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2739686073", "CorpusId": 135266387}, "title": "Carbon capture and storage: an effective way to mitigate global warming", "abstract": "MOST industries and power stations today are dependent upon the exploitation of fossil fuels, i.e. coal, oil and natural gas to meet their demands. While these energy sources are able to meet the needs to a large extent, they have various problems associated with them. The aforesaid fuels are all hydrocarbons and primarily release carbon dioxide (CO2) on combustion. Apart from CO2, these fuels are also known to emit other gases such as methane, oxides of sulphur, oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide, to name a few. These gases, which allow the incoming solar radiation to pass through but do not allow the trapped heat to escape, are known as greenhouse gases (GHGs). These gases, in the right proportions are necessary for human survival on planet Earth. However, their excessive release causes rise of temperatures on Earth. This process is known as global warming.

It follows previous IEA publications on CCS and studies on cleaner coal and advanced coal technologies. The paper benefitted from significant contributions and support from the China Coal Information Institute (CCII) of the State Administration of Work Safety (SAWS), and The Climate Group China. According to IEA analysis, if there are no major policy changes, carbon-intensive coal and other fossil fuels will continue to play a significant role in meeting future energy needs, both in China and globally. CCS is one technological option available to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the use of fossil fuels. CCS offers the opportunity to meet climate change objectives while providing energy security, as part of a portfolio of options including energy efficiency, renewable energy, nuclear energy, more efficient coal technologies and fuel switching from coal to gas. To meet global energy challenges associated with CO2 emissions, development and deployment of all available technologies will be necessary to achieve a more sustainable future. This paper discusses the status of CCS in China, providing updates on past activities in research and development (R&D), on current projects underway, and an overview of potential and challenges for CCS development in China. By exploring China\u2019s energy and emission trends and pathways, this paper analyses China\u2019s current CCS-related activities and policies, and options for financing CCS.

This paper describes a theory by which the passive acoustic signals detected by a hydrophone array can be used to quantify gas leakage, providing a practical (as opposed to research), passive and remote detection system which can monitor over a period of years using simple instrumentation.

In recent years, as concerns over the threats of climate change (CC) have become more acute, four technologies have notably risen to the forefront of academic and public discourse: nuclear power, carbon capture and storage (CCS), wind power, and geoengineering. The particular interest of these four approaches lies in the fact that they reflect both energy production and climate control technologies, are often socially controversial, and present complex challenges of governance. Nuclear and wind power both deserve an important place among the variety of low\u2010carbon energy options. In countries where public acceptance is evaluated, although, support for nuclear energy appears to be conditional upon simultaneous development of other renewable energies alongside a feasible plan to address the disposal of nuclear waste. The Fukushima accident sharply increased public concern about the safety and vulnerability of nuclear reactors. While wind power receives general public support, issues of accommodation can arise when it comes to siting wind farms. Persistent dependency upon carbon\u2010producing energy has made favorable the option of CCS. However, in addition to technical and geological factors, social resistance to the placement of carbon storage units remains a key obstacle. Geoengineering offers the technological capacity to directly act on the climate should levels of atmospheric CO2 become dangerously high. Public perception regarding the risk of climate change can be labile, and the alternatives reviewed here share the characteristic that their technical and political dimensions are intertwined. The variety of options for combining and implementing these technologies, coupled with the inherently time\u2010sensitive nature of CC, underscore the complexity of the endeavor. In order to bridge these various levels of analysis and decision making, and to better understand and integrate people's involvement, exercises in risk governance could be developed at both the national and international levels.

This paper reviews issues raised at a workshop on BECCS, convened in Scotland in late 2009. Presentations by bioenergy and CCS specialists covered topics including the climate policy rationale for BECCS, global biomass CCS potential, the UK potential for BECCS, the risk of fossil fuel lock\u2010in via coal co\u2010firing, and carbon market issues. In practice, the scale of the forestry and accessible CCS infrastructure required are among the obstacles to the large\u2010scale deployment of BECCS in the near term. While biomass co\u2010firing with coal offers an early route to BECCS, a quite substantial (>20%) biomass component may be necessary to achieve negative emissions in a co\u2010fired CCS system. Smaller scale BECCS, through co\u2010location of dedicated or co\u2010combusted biomass on fossil CCS CO 2 transport pipeline routes, is easier to envisage and would be potentially less problematic. Hence, we judge that BECCS can, and likely will, play a role in carbon reduction, but care needs to be taken not to exaggerate its potential, given that (i) there are few studies of the cost of connecting bio\u2010processing (combustion, gasification or other) infrastructure with CO 2 storage sites and (ii) that scenarios of global bioenergy potential remain contentious. \u00a9 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd", "year": 2011}]}
