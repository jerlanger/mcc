In many urban areas, the space available to provide storage is limited and thus the need to optimise the storage volume becomes critical. This paper will highlight the advantages and disadvantages of two different approaches of providing storage: 1) a single shallow storage (0.5 m depth) in which stormwater capture and a balanced release to supply users is provided by the one unit; and 2) a dual system in which the functions of stormwater capture and supply release are provided by two separate deeper storage units (2 m depth). The comparison between the two strategies is supported by water balance modelling assessing the supply reliability and storage volume requirements for both options. Above a critical volumetric capacity, the supply yield of a dual storage system is higher than that from a single storage of equal volume mainly because of a smaller assumed footprint. The single storage exhibited greater evaporation loss and is more susceptible to algae blooms due to long water residence times. Results of the comparison provide guidance to the design of more efficient storages associated with stormwater harvesting systems.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "f119c9524e68318fa21053a5fd0f872dbe844b87", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 248095534}, "title": "Heat Exchanger Design Handbook Dekker Mechanical Engineering |", "abstract": "TechnologyHeat Exchanger Design HandbookThermodynamicsMechanical Design of Heat Exchangers Volume 1 - Renewable Energy: Biomass resources and biofuel production; Bioenergy Utilization; Solar Energy; Wind Energy; Geothermal Energy; Tidal Energy.

Spontaneous potential, gamma ray, and resistivity logs from 96 wells were used in a regional scale evaluation of the Massive Sand Member of the lower Tuscaloosa Formation in Louisiana for carbon dioxide sequestration. Subsurface depths to the top of the Massive Sand Member range from roughly 750 m to 6400 m (2460\u201321,000 ft) with a regional basinward dip. Gross sandstone isopach reveals substantial sandstone thicknesses with a general trend of thickening basinward. Reservoir temperatures, estimated from corrected bottom hole temperatures, range from 44\u00b0C to 196\u00b0C (111\u2013353\u00b0F) with an average regional geothermal gradient of 0.029\u00b0C/m (1.6\u00b0F/100 ft). Reservoir pressures, determined from mud weight data, indicate a pressure range from 8 MPa (1160 psi) in north Louisiana to 71 MPa (10,300 psi) in the deepest locations. Under these conditions, carbon dioxide should be in a supercritical phase with densities of 200\u2013750 kg/m3 (13\u201350 lbs/ft3).

The pK(a) of the alkanolamine, the reaction enthalpy for carbamate formation, and the hydrolytic carbamate stability are important factors for the efficiency of CO(2) capture. The steric and electronic effects of CH(3), CH(2)F, CHF(2), CF(3), F, dimethyl, difluoro, and bis(2-trifluoromethyl) substituents at the \u03b1 carbon of MEA on this reaction are investigated. Density functional theory (DFT) (B3LYP, M06-2X, M08-HX and M11-L) and ab initio methods [spin component-scaled second-order M\u00f8ller-Plesset theory (SCS-MP2), G3], each coupled with solvent models [conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM) and universal solvation models (SM8 and SMD)], are shown to yield accurately calculated pK(a) values of the substituted MEAs. Specifically, G3, SCS-MP2, and M11-L methods coupled with the SMD and SM8 solvation models perform well with a mean unsigned error (MUE) of only 0.15, 0.24 and 0.25 pK(a) units, respectively. SCS-MP2 is used to calculate the reaction enthalpy for carbamate formation and the carbamate stability towards hydrolysis. With the introduction of \u03b2-fluoro substituents (especially the CH(2) F moiety) the reaction enthalpy for the formation of carbamates can be fine-tuned to be less exothermic than that using the unsubstituted MEA. This implies a reduced energy requirement for the solvent-regeneration step in the post-combustion carbon-capture method, which is currently the energy-limiting step in efficient CO(2) capture. \u03b2-Fluoro-substituted MEAs are also shown to form less stable carbamates than MEA. Thus, \u03b2-fluoro-substituted MEAs display a great potential for the use in the post-combustion carbon-capture process. Finally, a clear correlation is observed between the gas-phase basicity and the tendency to form carbamates.

Compared to other capture technologies, solid adsorbents looping technology (SALT) based post-combustion carbon capture, an alternative to the state-of-the-art energy intensive amine scrubbing process, is widely viewed as being the most viable technology that can be used as either as a retrofit to existing power plants or new build capacity. The potential success of SALT technology is largely determined by the development of novel CO2 adsorbents. Amine immobilized solid adsorbents are highlighted to be used in SALT technology due to their high CO2 selectivity (CO2/N2 >1000), suitable adsorption temperature and tolerance of moisture. Although they have so much advantages on carbon capture, the oxidation and degradation of solid amines are still a significant problem to be overcome. The degradation of the amine adsorbent can lead to a reduction in CO2 capture performance and selectivity, an increase in the process cost and corrosion problems. The aim of this project is to 1) develop new solid adsorbent materials with higher CO2 capture ability and superior adsorption-desorption lifetime performance; 2) to investigate effective measures to minimise or effectively prevent the thermal and oxidative degradation of the sorbent materials; 3) to explore approaches that can rejuvenate the degraded sorbents for re-use or convert them into other value-added products. \n \nFirstly, a series of PEI-the porous siliceous cellular foams (SCF) adsorbents have been developed and characterised. The results show a relationship between the textural properties of SCF and CO2 adsorption ability of adsorbents. A highly effective hydrothermal methodology was developed to produce extremely mesoporous silica materials with well-defined mesoporous structures and greatly increased pore volumes of up to 3.2 cm3/g. The PEI adsorbents prepared using SCF-3-120-24 (1.6 cm3/g) was found to have CO2 capture capacities of nearly 180.8 mg/g, which represents the highest adsorption capacity ever reported for supported PEI adsorbents. \n \nSecondly, lifetime performance testing and strategies to mitigate the thermal-oxidative degradation of PEI adsorbents and rejuvenation of the degraded PEI was investigated. The presence of moisture and additives was seen to enhance the thermal-oxidative stability of PEI. Furthermore, the doping of Na2B4O7 hydrates can increase the cyclic adsorption-desorption lifetime performance of PEI adsorbent. Meanwhile, the CO2 adsorption capacity of one heavily degraded PEI adsorbent was increased from 2.8 wt% to 6.2 wt% after rejuvenation test. \n \nFinally, hydrous pyrolysis and a continuous flow reactor system was used in catalytic hydrotreatments and hydrothermal treatments of six model MEA degradation compounds and two degraded MEA solvents. Most of the model compounds and degraded MEA was converted to piperazine derivatives in a H2 reaction atmosphere and pyrazine derivatives in NH3 reaction atmosphere.

On the basis of correlation analysis and comparative study, factors affecting the distribution and storage of SOC were investigated.Results and discussionThe average SOC content of the surface soil in June and November was 4.65 and 6.13\u00a0g\u00a0kg\u22121, respectively. The distribution of surface SOC content was consistent with the distribution of vegetation and was affected by the soil particle size. In plant-covered area, the relationship between SOC content and depth could be expressed by the power function y\u2009=\u2009axb. The contribution of plants to SOC was only significant in the shallow layer. As for the deep layer, the SOC content was higher in the mudflat. The organic carbon storage in the upper 1\u00a0m soil was estimated at 1.795\u00a0kg\u00a0m\u22122 in average and the total organic carbon storage of Changyi wetland was estimated at 6.373\u2009\u00d7\u2009107\u00a0kg. The sedimentation rate was very low and the average organic carbon burial flux of the whole wetland was 17.5\u00a0g\u00a0m\u22122\u00a0a\u22121.ConclusionsLow sedimentation rate, weak downward migration, and high decomposition rate of organic matter caused by poor hydrological condition were the reasons why the SOC storage in Changyi wetland was low. Under intensive human activities, the Changyi wetland was drying and the organic carbon storage was reducing. Strategies were proposed to be taken urgently to restore the wetland for the long-term benefit.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "35f97bc454cd3e5a49bd66b25f058a7bec4e436c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2580634080", "DOI": "10.1186/s13021-017-0070-4", "CorpusId": 6556710, "PubMed": "28184238"}, "title": "A carbon balance model for the great dismal swamp ecosystem", "abstract": "BackgroundCarbon storage potential has become an important consideration for land management and planning in the United States. The ability to assess ecosystem carbon balance can help land managers understand the benefits and tradeoffs between different management strategies. This paper demonstrates an application of the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS) model developed for local-scale land management at the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge. We estimate the net ecosystem carbon balance by considering past ecosystem disturbances resulting from storm damage, fire, and land management actions including hydrologic inundation, vegetation clearing, and replanting.ResultsWe modeled the annual ecosystem carbon stock and flow rates for the 30-year historic time period of 1985\u20132015, using age-structured forest growth curves and known data for disturbance events and management activities. The 30-year total net ecosystem production was estimated to be a net sink of 0.97\u00a0Tg\u00a0C. When a hurricane and six historic fire events were considered in the simulation, the Great Dismal Swamp became a net source of 0.89\u00a0Tg\u00a0C. The cumulative above and below-ground carbon loss estimated from the South One and Lateral West fire events totaled 1.70\u00a0Tg\u00a0C, while management activities removed an additional 0.01\u00a0Tg\u00a0C. The carbon loss in below-ground biomass alone totaled 1.38\u00a0Tg\u00a0C, with the balance (0.31\u00a0Tg\u00a0C) coming from above-ground biomass and detritus.ConclusionsNatural disturbances substantially impact net ecosystem carbon balance in the Great Dismal Swamp. Through alternative management actions such as re-wetting, below-ground biomass loss may have been avoided, resulting in the added carbon storage capacity of 1.38\u00a0Tg. Based on two model assumptions used to simulate the peat system, (a burn scar totaling 70\u00a0cm in depth, and the soil carbon accumulation rate of 0.36\u00a0t\u00a0C/ha\u22121/year\u22121 for Atlantic white cedar), the total soil carbon loss from the South One and Lateral West fires would take approximately 1740\u00a0years to re-amass.

Here we demonstrate the significant contribution that traditional agroforests with shaded tree crops can make to landscape C storage, and thus climate change mitigation, focusing on the cocoa (Theobroma cacao) agroforests (locally known as cabrucas) of southern Bahia, Brazil. Using published allometric relationships and tree inventories of 55 shaded cocoa farms, 6 mature forests, 8 disturbed forests and 7 fallows, we calculate average aboveground C stocks of 87 and 46\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121 in traditional and intensified cocoa agroforests, respectively, 183\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121 in old-growth forests, 102\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121 in disturbed forests and 33\u00a0Mg\u00a0ha\u22121 in fallows. Based on the most recent land cover data available, we estimate that cocoa agroforests hold 59\u00a0% of the total aboveground C stocks of the tree dominated vegetation in this landscape, while forests hold 32\u00a0% and fallows hold 9\u00a0%. Carbon stocks of intensified cocoa agroforestry systems were only little over one-half of those of traditional agroforests, indicating a threat to landscape C stocks from current land use trends. We show that in agroforests as in natural forests, C stocks are highly concentrated in the largest trees. This suggests that the intensification of traditional agroforests, which generally involves increasing the density of cocoa and other tree crops and reducing the density of shade trees, is possible without greatly affecting their C storage if large trees are conserved. In order to conserve the climate stabilizing effect of traditional agroforests and steer necessary intensification measures towards climate-friendly solutions, we suggest that biodiversity and C-rich traditional agroforests should be included in current discussions about Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and/or their owners be rewarded for their environmental services through other incentive mechanisms.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "6d6bea3399e8aea09261d80d01b0a7082dded605", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2124903234", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1010377818094", "CorpusId": 10609251}, "title": "Root proliferation, nitrate inflow and their carbon costs during nitrogen capture by competing plants in patchy soil", "abstract": "The responses of roots to nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich patches of soil include proliferation of laterals and stimulation of nutrient inflow (uptake rate per unit root length) within the patch. Nitrate uptake from an N-rich patch is thereby maximised and, perhaps, compensates for an uneven supply of nitrate to the whole root system. Paradoxically, the often weak correlation between root length density and N uptake found in experiments on single plants and crop monocultures suggests that root proliferation in patches has only a minor compensatory influence on N capture. This paradox was resolved when it was realised that localised root proliferation during inter-specific competition for nitrate can lead to a strong association between root length density and nitrate capture. Here, a simple model of inter-specific competition is used to estimate the stimulation in inflow required in one plant to match the N capture of a competitor that responds only by root proliferation, and to estimate associated carbon costs. The model predicts that nitrate inflow must increase proportionally more than root length density to achieve the same N capture. For example, the N capture possible with a 10% increase in root length density can be matched by increasing N inflow by anything from 20% to 20-fold, depending on the initial conditions: the faster the rate of change in root length density, the greater the required relative increase in inflow. In those terms, proliferation would seem the better option, but one that may be more costly in terms of its carbon requirement.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "9decc61a74c30c971984813fbd61990555e24ac7", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 221543420}, "title": "Synergy of S-CO2 Power Cycle and CCS Systems", "abstract": "Supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) cycles are currently researched for many applications ranging from nuclear energy through geothermal, solar and waste heat recovery systems. One of the major issue of their development is the design of compressor and heat exchangers close to the critical point. In addition, in the real operation carbon dioxide will not be pure and some impurities will be always present. Similar issues are currently faced with the carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems, which are used for the reduction of CO2 from the flue gas of the fossil fired power plants in order to reduce the global warming. The removed CO2 can be used for other technology such as extraction of oil or stored. CCS consists of three separate technologies (capture, transport and storage). While CCS technology for reduction of CO2 from exhaust gas is quite promising there are several drawbacks. Very important are issues related to effect of impurities in the removed CO2 gas. A similar issue is researched for the pinch point shift within the S-CO2 cycle heat exchangers. In this case the captured CO2 is a multiple-component mixture by definition. This paper is focused on the research of CO2 mixtures and their effect on heat exchangers in the S-CO2 cycles and the CCS systems. Some other effects on compressor are mentioned as well. The effect of typical impurities in the S-CO2 cycles (N2, He, O2, and Ar) and from the CCS technology (H2, H2S, CH4 and CO) on the heat exchanger size and pressure drop are investigated. It is shown that in most cases mixtures cause an increase of the heat exchanger volume and the increase of the pressure drop. The synergistic research on CO2 mixtures is important for both technologies. This synergy will bring new interesting findings that will help development of both the CSS system and the S-CO2 cycles. INTRODUCTION The supercritical carbon dioxide (S-CO2) cycles are recently very perspective and are researched all around the world. They have many applications in many technologies ranging from nuclear energy through geothermal, solar and waste heat recovery systems. Nevertheless, this cycle has several issues. Probably the most important and well known is the existence of the pinch point in heat exchangers, which significantly affects their design. The pinch point is caused by the variations of heat capacity of CO2 and occurs when the heat capacity of the hot and cold streams (each at a different pressure level) intersect. Due to the pinch point, the heat exchangers may have a large size and low efficiency. However, this point can be removed in several ways. One of them is the addition of small amount of other substance into the pure CO2. [1] Furthermore, as it is difficult to use a 100 % pure CO2 in the S-CO2 cycles so one may expect about 1% of mole fraction of other substances in it. These impurities are present in working medium and the resulting mixture of CO2 may lead to the disappearance of the pinch point in the regenerative heat exchanger, on the other hand the impurities have a negative effect on other components such as compressor or cooler [2]. The CCS systems are very perspective for the reduction of CO2 from the flue gas of the fossil fired power plants. However, the captured CO2 is a multiple-component mixture with the same negative effect on the CCS system components as in the S-CO2 cycles. This effect is especially high for the transport and the storage part of the CCS system. The 5th International Supercritical CO2 Power Cycles Symposium March 29 31, 2016, San Antonio, Texas 2 In the CCS systems CO2 is used in the supercritical state or close to the critical pressure as well as in the case of the S-CO2 cycles. The reason is the better transport properties of CO2 mainly the high density. The transport parameters depend on the phase of CO2 [3]. It can be done in the gas phase or in the liquid phase. For the gas phase the transport pressure is about 15 MPa (depending on the storage, the transport line and the utilization). The liquid phase has a typical transport pressure of about 6.5 MPa. [3] A compressor station is used to achieve the required transport pressure. Coolers cool down CO2 to the required transport temperature which can be below 0\u00b0C (liquid phase). Hence problems with mixtures in the SCO2 cycles are quite the same as for the transport of CO2. A full understanding of the effect of mixtures on heat exchangers and compressors is necessary. A very interesting possibility is to use CO2 from storage as a working medium in the S-CO2 cycles or in other systems which use CO2 as a working medium. However, mixtures from capture will probably have a negative effect on the cycle efficiency. Operating costs will be decreased if transport of pure CO2 is problematic and CCS system is operated near the cycle. Mixture from CCS will reduce operating cost. Other way is the implementation of the S-CO2 cycles in the compressor stations or other parts of the CCS systems as cycles for waste heat recovery. This paper is focused on the research of CO2 mixtures and their effect on heat exchangers in the S-CO2 cycles and the CCS systems. THE DESCRIPTION OF THE S-CO2 CYCLE The S-CO2 cycle is a gas cycle developed from the Ericsson-Brayton cycle, which offers many different layouts. The basic layouts are. [4]. \u2022 Simple Brayton cycle \u2022 Re-compression cycle \u2022 Pre-compression cycle \u2022 Split expansion cycle \u2022 Partial cooling cycle Figure 1.: Simple Brayton cycle (a) and recompression cycle (b) layout The 5th International Supercritical CO2 Power Cycles Symposium March 29 31, 2016, San Antonio, Texas 3 These cycles were described already in the second half of the 20th century [5]. There are many other layouts of these cycles for solar, geothermal power plant and waste heat recovery. The main advantages of the S-CO2 cycles are that they are simpler and more compact compared to the Rankine-Clausius cycle. Hence, the SCO2 cycles are likely to have lower costs, shorter construction period and shorter commissioning period. These benefits come from the properties of CO2. On the other hand, properties of CO2 have a negative effect on some components and they affect the behavior of the cycle and the cycle efficiency. The simple Brayton cycle and the recompression cycle are shown in Figure 1. These cycles have a turbine (T), one or two compressors (C1 and C2), recuperative heat exchanger(s) (RH or LTR and HTR), a cooler (C) and a heater (H). THE DESCRIPTION OF THE CCS TECHOLOGY The CCS technologies are used to capture CO2 from flue gas of the fossil fired power stations, transport it and store it on a selected place. The system first captures CO2 from flue gas. The capture can be done by three basic methods: the pre-combustion method, the post-combustion method and the oxy-fuel combustion. The capture of CO2 in the pre-combustion method is done before the combustion and it is a part of fuel gasification. The capture in the post combustion method is simple for construction, because capture is done after combustion. Thus, this capture system can be built at the existing fossil power plants. In the oxy-fuel combustion the fuel is combusted with pure O2 and with subsequently CO2 captured. Capture of CO2 can be done for cement, concrete, iron and steel industry as well. [3] Other part of the CCS technology is the transport of CO2. In this part CO2 is transported to the specific place, where it is prepared for storage or for injection to the oil fields. The transport is selected according to the place of storage or according to the future use and based on the amount of CO2 which is captured. Currently, the transport can be done in liquid or gaseous phase. The transport of the gaseous phase is done through pipeline. The pipeline can be used for both type of storage. The transport of liquid phase is done through tanks for CO2 or by ship, train or truck according to the type of the storage method. The transport parameters of CO2 are different for the gaseous phase and for the liquid phase. A compression station is used for the pipeline transport for the transport by tanks. Pipelines operates from 8.6 to 20 MPa with the ambient temperature from 4 \u00b0C to 38\u00b0 C [3]. Booster stations must be used for the pipeline transport because of the pressure drop along the pipeline. The number of the booster stations depends on the length of the pipeline. The compression station for a pipeline is shown in Figure 2. The transport pressure for liquid CO2 is in the range from 0.52 MPa up to 7.3 MPa [3]. The most common parameters are pressure of 0.65 MPa and the temperature of about -50 \u00b0C [6]. A compression station for the transportation of liquid phase of CO2 is shown in Figure 3. The storage can be done onshore or offshore. The transport for an onshore storage can be done with a pipeline or tanks. It is the same as for liquid. Type of transport depends on the distance between the capture and the storage sites. The mixtures of CO2 from capture differ based on the separation method of CO2 and the type of industry on which the CCS system is employed. The basic components of mixture from capture are N2, O2, CO, Ar, H2S, H2 and H2O. An example of mixture of CO2 for transport in pipelines is shown in Table 1. Table 1.

One way to achieve an overall system efficiency of greater than 60% is in a power plant in which a catalytic coal gasifier produces a syngas with a methane composition of roughly 25% on a dry volume basis and this is sent to a SOFC, with CO2 capture occurring either before or after the SOFC. Integration of a catalytic gasifier with a SOFC, as opposed to a conventional entrained flow gasifier, is improved due to (a) decreased exergy destruction inside a catalytic, steam-coal gasifier producing a high-methane content syngas, and (b) decreased exergy destruction in the SOFC due to the ability to operate at lower air stoichiometric flow ratios. For example, thermal management of the SOFC is greatly improved due to the steam-methane reforming in the anode of the fuel cell. This paper has two main goals. First, we converted the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) estimates of various research groups into an average internal rate of return on investment (IRR) in order to make comparisons between their results, and to underscore the increased rate of return on investment for advanced integrated gasification fuel cell systems with carbon capture & sequestration (IGFC-CCS) compared with conventional integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC-CCS) systems and pulverized coal combustion (PCC-CCS) systems. Using capital, labor, and fuel costs from previous researchers and using an average price of baseload electricity generation of $61.50 / MW-hr, we calculated inflation-adjusted IRR values of up to 13%/yr for catalytic gasification with pressurized fuel cell and carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), whereas we calculate an IRR of \u223c4%/yr and \u223c2%/yr for new, conventional IGCC-CCS and PCC-CCS, respectively. If the carbon dioxide is used for enhanced oil recovery rather than for saline aquifer storage, then the IRR values improve to 16%/yr, 10%/yr, and 8%/yr, respectively. For comparison, the IRR of a new conventional IGCC or PCC power plant without CO2 capture are estimated to be 11%/yr and 15.0%/yr, respectively. Second, we conducted an exergy analysis of two different configurations in which syngas from a catalytic gasifier fuels a SOFC. In the first case, the CO2 is captured before the SOFC, and the anode tail gas is sent back to the catalytic gasifier. In the second case, the anode tail gas is oxy-combusted using oxygen ion ceramic membranes and then CO2 is captured for sequestration. In both cases, we find that the system efficiency is greater than 60%. These values compare well with previous system analysis [1\u20134]. In future work, we plan to calculate the IRR of these two cases and compare with previous economic analyses conducted at NETL [1\u20132].Copyright \u00a9 2011 by ASME", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "23d0fbb09e376903654b6fdec6984bb78ebf537e", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 219978607}, "title": "An Overview on the Carbon Utilization Technologies With an approach to the negative emission construction material", "abstract": "As an additional strategy to reduce carbon dioxide in carbon capture and storage, carbon sequestration, and utilization (CCU) is of great importance worldwide.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a promising technology to effectively reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. There are various candidate materials for CO2 capture but each has its own advatanges and disadvantages. Carbon-based materials are of low-cost and have relatively high cyclicity for CO2 and its porous structure and surface functional groups can be tailored to improve CO2 capture performance. Effective but low-cost carbon precursors need to be explored for potential mass production in the furture. This research aims to explore various polymeric, biomass and graphitic materials as the precursors for the development of effecive carbon sobents for CO2 capture. In addition, the influence of porous structures and chemical dopants on CO2 sorption are also experimentally studied in relation to the porosities and surface chemistry of the sorbents. Five distinct synthesis approaches are explored comparatively to determine the potential of polymeric, biomass and graphitic materials as precursors for effective carbon sorbents. These approaches include a novel method of producing millimetre-sized carbon spheres from poly(acrylonitrile-co-acrylamide)/DMSO solution, chemical activation of London Plane leaves, spruce pine cones and graphite oxide, and ball-milling of graphite. The work on the polymer-derived carbon spheres produced desirable carbon macro-spheres with radially channelled and hierarchically porous structures, via a \u201cone-pot\u201d solvent exchange process. The structure shows excellent CO2 capacity of 16.7 wt% at 25 \u00b0C and under 1 bar CO2, enhanced by rich nitrogen doping and microporosities. The biomass-derived carbon sorbents further clarify the influence of metal-dopants, inherited from the biomass precursors, on CO2 adsorption. It was noted that besides nitrogen dopant and ultramicropores (<0.7 nm), residual calcium and magnesium in biomass-derived carbon also enhanced CO2 adsorption on carbon sorbents. The CO2 uptake of a pine cone-derived carbon sorbent (20.9 wt%) has matched the highest CO2 uptake (21.2 wt%) reported in the literature at 25 \u00b0C and under 1 bar CO2, though the latter has a relatively large ultramicropore volume. To further clarify the influence of microporous structure and chemical dopants on CO2 uptake, graphite oxide (GO) and ball-milled graphite (BG) were studied as graphitic precursors as these have known chemical structures and their resulting sorbents contain no other chemical dopants. The characterisation results show chemical activation with potassium hydroxide can develop a similar porous structure in GO- and BG-derived carbon, compared with those of polymer- and biomass- derived carbon. However, the former show comparatively lower CO2 capture capacities under the same test conditions (25 \u00b0C and 1 bar CO2), which is believed to be due to less well-developed ultramicroporous structure and the absence of chemical dopants. Based on the present experimental data, further analysis reveals that there is a difference between specific surface area calculated by the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) equation and the Density Functional Theory (DFT) model. The cause of this is the intrinsic difference in the method of calculation, where the BET equation assumes a flat and homogeneous surface, while the DFT model takes the pore shape into consideration. Furthermore, both CO2 uptake and specific CO2 uptake (CO2 uptake/porosity) are plotted against three porosity parameters, namely BET surface area, total pore volume and ultramicropore volume. The plots show those samples with higher nitrogen and metal contents exihibit higher specific CO2 uptakes. To extend the interpretation of results, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is adopted as a simulation tool to study the influence of ultramicropore, nitrogen and metal dopants on CO2 uptake. Characteristic results from both the present work and the literature are used as the input data for the simulation. The simulated results show CO2 uptake increases considerably with increasing ultramicropore volume and metal content. However, the nitrogen content has relatively limited influence, compared with the former two, contrary to common belief. Finally, several future lines of work are proposed to further improve the performance of the materials. For the synthesis of carbon spheres, DMSO can be added into the water bath to slow the solvent exchange process. As a result, the macroporous strucure of the sphere can be modified to enhance its mechanical strength. For the study on the biomass-derived carbon, several other leaves can also be used as carbon precursors. The porosities, chemical compositions and CO2 uptakes of the cabon sorbents derived from these leaves can be compared with those of the London Plane leaf-derived carbon, to further clarify the influence of the biological structures and chemical properties of biomass precursors on the resulting carbon. For the work on ANN, the simulation is limited by the available experimental data for metal-doped carbon. The accuracy of prediction by ANN can be further improved when more experimental data are reported in the literature and used for training the network.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "4f0420760d2b6d9b23df6e68711ec186cf21cc33", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2009791881", "DOI": "10.3109/14756366.2012.761608", "CorpusId": 36784691, "PubMed": "23409779"}, "title": "Biomimetic CO2 capture using a highly thermostable bacterial \u03b1-carbonic anhydrase immobilized on a polyurethane foam", "abstract": "Abstract The biomimetic approach represents an interesting strategy for carbon dioxide (CO2) capture, offering advantages over other methods, due to its specificity for CO2 and its eco-compatibility, as it allows concentration of CO2 from other gases, and its conversion to water soluble ions. This approach uses microorganisms capable of fixing CO2 through metabolic pathways or via the use of an enzyme, such as carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1).

In this study, we evaluated the performance of the SOILCO2 model in predicting soil CO2 dynamics, especially CO2 concentrations at various depths in an arable bare land of Andisol. We attempted to experimentally determine two soil parameters required for the CO2 production model, the optimal CO2 production rate and the parameter of a depth-dependent CO2 production function, by measuring CO2 efflux from the surface and a vertical distribution of concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, respectively. Soil CO2 concentrations, water contents, and temperatures were continuously monitored for about a half year at three different depths.

This paper focuses on CO2 injection into geological media and its applicability to the Lamu basin. Sedimentary basins, which host the geological formations suitable for subsurface CO2 storage, are ideal to varied extents determined by such factors as their tectonic settings. A (coarse) basin scale suitability assessment of the Lamu basin was undertaken using the following parameters; size and depth, tectonic and structural settings, seismicity, geothermal-hydrodynamic regimes, basin maturity (based on hydrocarbon well density) and economic resources. The assessed attributes are used to constrain GIS data, delineating possible CCS trap areas with the production of a preliminary map of potential trap areas. Also, a suitability matrix table is generated in comparison with analogous basins such as the Alberta basin in Canada. Following this assessment, the Lamu basin can be considered geologically suitable for geosequestration given its stable tectonic settings, good depth and size.

These include the order in which individual depocentres were formed, the timing of deposition of laterally varying stratigraphic packages, which units were confined to individual rift depocentres and how the transition between depositional environments was controlled by rift related tectonism. The approach first involved the integration of stratigraphic correlations, petrophysical interpretation, drill-core descriptions and biostratigraphy with seismic facies analysis. This resulted in the identification of at least two new lithostratigraphic members and the construction of a new stratigraphic framework for the sediments. Structural analysis was then undertaken by building a 3D structural model which was used to calculate cumulative displacement rate across depocentre bounding faults and sediment accumulation rates within the main depocentres. This analysis suggests that changes in rates of fault activity were the primary control on temporal shifts in depositional environments. The results were then enhanced by building a series of continental sequence stratigraphy models for each depocentre. These demonstrated that a series of age correlatable regional tectonic events controlled common variations in the vertical stacking order of stratigraphy in all the depocentres. Sequence stratigraphy interpretation also allowed detailed palaeogeography mapping which in turn led to the construction of a high-resolution volumetric model of the Crayfish Group members. This resulted in a revised chronostratigraphic framework for the onshore Otway Basin, which provided a basis for explaining the relationship between fluvio-lacustrine sedimentation and tectonism during the early history of intercontinental rift systems. Finally, the resulting geological model was used to evaluate its consequences on the thermal history and source rock maturation of the basin. This was done by building a series of 1D and 3D thermal models. These models allowed investigation of the potential for both conventional and unconventional petroleum systems and carbon capture and storage potential. They demonstrate that the highest quality source rocks in the system are mature for hydrocarbon generation but are restricted to a series of ancient lacustrine environments within the central Otway Basin.

It is estimated that this area has the potential to store in the range of 1.1 to 2.3 Gigatons of CO 2 , which is approximately the amount that Alabama's coal-fired power plants emit in two decades. The targeted coal seams range from 940 to 1,800 feet deep and are one to six feet thick. Approximately 240 tons of CO 2 will be injected over a 45-to 60-day period.

The tracer technology improved modeling techniques vital to defining storage capacity, injection capability, flow rates, and numbers of wells associated with storage sites. Carbon dioxide concentrations as small as parts-per-quadrillion levels can be measured by the technology, and injected CO 2 can be differentiated from natural CO 2.

First, because of the high-compressibility of gas, these reservoirs have larger storage capacity than oil reservoirs or aquifers. Second, the condensate that has dropped out from the gas phase during natural depletion will re-vapourize because of re-pressurization of the reservoir and by miscibility with the injected CO2. This condensate can be recovered from producing wells and leaves more pore volume for available storage of CO2. The objective of this study is to investigate the CO2 storage capacity in different formation types, for different levels of CO2 purity and different injection schedules. To this aim, we analyzed the injection of a CO2-based stream into a depleted gas condensate reservoir and into a saline aquifer using a compositional reservoir simulation model. The dynamics of the reservoir impose a minimum period of injection that is required in order for the storage scheme to benefit from 100% of the reservoir storage capacity. Hence, over and above a certain CO2 injection rate, it becomes meaningless to invest in bigger compressors to increase this rate to reduce the time of injection. When the CO2 stream contains impurities, such as N2 or methane, the storage capacity of the reservoir decreases proportionally to the impure stream\u2019s compressibility factor and its concentration of impurities. This finding suggests that an economic optimum between the costs of separation, compression and injection can be determined. Finally, the mass of CO2 sequestrated per pore volume in the equivalent aquifer model is approximately 13 times lower that of the depleted gas condensate reservoir model. This confirms that, because of their low overall compressibility, aquifers offer a far lower ratio of CO2 stored per pore volume than depleted gas condensate reservoirs. However, aquifers tend to have a far larger extent, which often compensates somewhat for this lower ratio and therefore provides storage for significant volumes of CO2.

Furthermore, they are under pressure to curb them in order to ensure continuity of operations and aid in the reduction of the greenhouse effect. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is touted by the IEA and IPCC as a vital mitigation tool. Coal fired power plants should invest in capture technologies (accounting for 80% of CCS costs); post combustion capture is regarded as mature and can be retrofitted to existing coal plants. Furthermore, capture of emissions ensures energy security through elongated coal usage. However, at present, investment in this technology has been unenthusiastic and sluggish. This inaction calls into question the current institutional framework with its main driving force, the EU ETS. Numerous studies have taken place involving the necessity of CCS, i.e. the value chain, institutional frameworks, markets and its qualities & flaws; nonetheless there is a lack in knowledge on how coal power plant owners/operators can be incentivized to be first movers. This paper identifies the obstacles coal-fired power plants with capture await and recommends how these could be reduced and possibly avoided.

The present study represents a part of a series of system evaluations being carried out at NETL to aid in prioritizing technological advances along research pathways to the realization of utility-scale SOFC systems, a transformational goal of the fuel cell program. In particular, the system performance of utility-scale NG fuel cell (NGFC) systems with and without carbon dioxide (CO2) capture is presented.\n The NGFC system analyzed features an external auto-thermal reformer (ATR) feeding the fuel to the SOFC system consisting of planar anode-supported SOFC with separated anode and cathode off-gas streams. In systems with CO2 capture, an air separation unit (ASU) is used to provide the oxygen for the ATR and for the combustion of unutilized fuel in the SOFC anode exhaust along with a CO2 purification unit to provide a nearly pure CO2 stream suitable for transport for usage in enhanced oil recovery operations or for storage in underground saline formations. Remaining thermal energy in the exhaust gases is recovered in a bottoming steam Rankine cycle while supplying any process heat requirements. A reduced order model (ROM) developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) is used to predict the SOFC performance. The ROM, while being computationally effective for system studies, provides other detailed information about the state of the stack, such as the internal temperature gradient, generally not available from simple performance models often used to represent the SOFC.

CLC is an innovative concept and an attractive option to capture CO2 with a significantly lower energy penalty than other carbon-capture technologies. The principal idea behind CLC is to split the combustion process into two separate steps (redox reactions) carried out in two separate reactors: an oxidation reaction and a reduction reaction, by introducing suitable metal oxide which acts as an oxygencarrier that circulates between the two reactors. In this study, an Aspen Plus model was developed by employing the conservation of mass and energy for all the components of the CLC system. In the analysis, equilibrium based thermodynamic reactions with no oxygen-carrier deactivation were considered. The model was employed to investigate the effect of various key operating parameters such as air, fuel and oxygen carrier (OC) mass flow rates, operating pressure, and waste heat recovery on the performance of a natural gas fired power plant with multi-stage CLC. Results of these parameters on the plant efficiency are presented. The analysis shows efficiency gain of more than 6% over that of conventional power plant with CO2 capture technologies when CLC is integrated with the power plant. INTRODUCTION In view of the mounting evidence for global warming, the case for reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants has become more compelling. Traditional CO2 capture technologies have significant energy penalty. Alternative technologies, such as chemical looping combustion (CLC) are more promising. Originally proposed by Richter and Knoche [1] as a scheme for improving combustion efficiency, CLC was later reconsidered for its inherent ability to capture CO2 efficiently. The principle behind this technology is the combustion of fuel in a nitrogen free environment, which results in the production of stream of carbon dioxide and water only. Water can be condensed and CO2 stream purified for storage or reuse. The overall CLC process consists of two fluidized bed reactors interconnected in a single loop through which solid OC particles circulate. The reactors are termed the oxidation or air and reduction or fuel reactors, where oxidation and reduction refer to the metal oxide. The function of the OC particles is the transportation of oxygen from the air to the fuel reactor. Suitable OC particles include transition metals such as Iron, Nickel, Copper and Manganese. In the air reactor, incoming compressed air reacts with the inbound metal oxygen carrier, oxidizing the metal to the corresponding metal oxide in an exothermic reaction. The solid product stream comprising the metal oxide is separated from the gas stream and transmitted to the reducing or fuel reactor and the high temperature gaseous product stream, consisting of nitrogen and un-reacted oxygen, is released into the environment after appropriate power extraction. A gaseous fuel (natural gas) is injected into the reduction reactor where it is combusted by the incoming lattice oxygen of the metal oxide producing CO2 and water. The gaseous product stream can be easily stripped off the water by condensation. The remaining carbon dioxide is available for storage or use. In this reduction reaction, the metal oxide is reduced to the corresponding metal or metal oxide with lower oxygen ratio and is transferred back to the oxidizer reactor. The reduction reaction could be exothermic or endothermic depending on the combination of metal and fuel used. However, as for any oxidation/reduction reaction the combined heat of reaction remains the same as in a conventional combustion reaction between fuel and air. CLC technology does not provide any advantage in enthalpy gain.

Currently, hydrogen production, storage, transport and utilisation are being explored to scope opportunities and to reduce barriers to market activation. One such barrier could be negative public response to hydrogen technologies. Previous research around socio-technical risks finds that public acceptance issues are particularly challenging for emerging, remote, technical, sensitive, uncertain or unfamiliar technologies - such as hydrogen. Thus, while the hydrogen value chain could offer a range of potential environmental, economic and social benefits, each will have perceived risks that could challenge the introduction and subsequent roll-out of hydrogen. These potential issues must be identified and managed so that the hydrogen sector can develop, adapt or respond appropriately. The geological storage of hydrogen could present challenges in terms of the perceived safety of the approach. Valuable lessons can be learned from international research and practice of CO2 and natural gas storage in geological formations (for carbon capture and storage, CCS, and for power, respectively).

In these reactors, up to one-third of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) content is naturally pre-acidified in a first stage pre-acidification (PA) and then fed to a second stage digester for conversion to methane. Traditionally, all the generated gases from the PA tank will be vented to the atmosphere. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are the main gases generated in the PA tank. A pilot-scale of two-stage anaerobic expanded granular sludge bed reactor was fabricated and used to investigate the impact of the PA gas injection into the second stage. The gas from the PA reactor was captured and stored in the storage tank. The tests were run under two temperature ranges and five organic loading rates (\u223c2, 3, 4, 5, and 6\u2009g COD/L.day). For mesophilic range, the biogas production and energy yield increased by 10\u201390% and 40\u2013130%, respectively, from without PA gas injection case compared to with PA injection case. For thermophilic range, the biogas production and energy yield increased by 12\u201340% and 90\u2013140%, respectively, from without PA gas injection compared to with PA injection case. For each OLR, the gas production and energy yield were 90 to 160% more in thermophilic range than the mesophilic range for the cases with and without the PA gas injection. This implies that a higher temperature range has a significant impact on energy yield in a digester.

Conventional amine-based solvents that are used for CO2 capture show some drawbacks, such as high solvent loss, high regeneration energy requirement, and solvent degradation. These shortcomings can be potentially overcome if IL-based solvents are considered. ILs have negligible vapour pressure, high thermal stability, and wide range of thermophysical properties. Nonetheless, using experimentation to identify suitable ILs as CO2-capturing solvents is a tedious and costly task, as there are more than a million possible combinations of cations and anions that make up the ILs.

However, non-linear programming sometimes fails to converge, due to enlarged search space for optimal solution and its complex formulations. In this paper, the authors present a simple yet systematic visual approach to design IL solvents for carbon capture. Property integration framework is employed in this approach to systematically design IL, where the design problem can be mapped from the property domain into a cluster domain through clustering technique. The advantage of the visual approach is the ability to enumerate novel IL candidates. Group contribution (GC) method is included in the framework to estimate the properties of designed ILs.

These methods, however, often contain considerable uncertainty in estimating the state of stress. In this paper, we build on a Bayesian approach to quantify uncertainty in stress estimations for subsurface engineering applications. This approach can provide an estimate of the 3D distribution of stress throughout the volume of interest and provide an estimate of the uncertainty arising from the stress measurement, the rheology parameters, and a paucity of measurements. The value of this approach is demonstrated using stress measurements from the In Salah carbon storage site, which was one of the first world\u2019s industrial carbon capture and storage projects. This demonstration shows the application of this Bayesian approach for estimating the initial state of stress for In Salah and quantifying the uncertainty in the estimated stress. Also, an assessment of a maximum injection pressure to prevent geomechanical risks from CO2 injection pressures is provided in terms of the probability distribution of the minimum principal stress quantified by the approach.

The post-combustion capture by chemical absorption in amine aqueous solutions has been in use in chemical and petrochemical areas for decades.

The carbon capture by aqueous ammonia is based on the conventional absorption-regeneration scheme applied to the ternary system CO 2 \u2013NH 3 \u2013H 2 O. It can be implemented in a chilled and a cooled process, depending upon the temperatures in the absorber and, hence, the precipitation of salts. The process simulation can be conducted in two manners: the equilibrium and the rate-based approaches. The specific heat duty is as low as 3.0, for the cooled process, and 2.2 MJ/kg CO2 , for the chilled one. Moreover, the index SPECCA is as low as 2.6, for the cooled, and 2.9 MJ/kg CO2 , for the chilled one. The overall energy performances from the simulations in the rate-based approach, compared against those in the equilibrium approach, result only slightly penalized.

The ability to assess ecosystem carbon balance can help land managers understand the benefits and tradeoffs between different management strategies. This paper demonstrates an application of the Land Use and Carbon Scenario Simulator (LUCAS) model developed for local-scale land management at the Great Dismal Swamp National Wildlife Refuge. We estimate the net ecosystem carbon balance by considering past ecosystem disturbances resulting from storm damage, fire, and land management actions including hydrologic inundation, vegetation clearing, and replanting. Results We modeled the annual ecosystem carbon stock and flow rates for the 30-year historic time period of 1985\u20132015, using age-structured forest growth curves and known data for disturbance events and management activities. The 30-year total net ecosystem production was estimated to be a net sink of 0.97 Tg C. When a hurricane and six historic fire events were considered in the simulation, the Great Dismal Swamp became a net source of 0.89 Tg C. The cumulative above and below-ground carbon loss estimated from the South One and Lateral West fire events totaled 1.70 Tg C, while management activities removed an additional 0.01 Tg C. The carbon loss in below-ground biomass alone totaled 1.38 Tg C, with the balance (0.31 Tg C) coming from above-ground biomass and detritus. Conclusions Natural disturbances substantially impact net ecosystem carbon balance in the Great Dismal Swamp. Through alternative management actions such as re-wetting, below-ground biomass loss may have been avoided, resulting in the added carbon storage capacity of 1.38 Tg.

We simulated CO2-EOR using a numerical model developed on the platform of TOUGH2MP-TMVOC to evaluate the effect of different levels of heterogeneity on oil production, gas storage, and flow behaviors in a tight reservoir, controlled by standard deviation and correlation length. A comparison of nine cases reveals that porosity heterogeneity commonly intensifies flow channeling, and there is an oil production decline with higher standard deviation and longer correlation length of porosity field. In addition, the porosity correlation length has a negligible effect on reservoir performance when the standard deviation is relatively low. Furthermore, strong heterogeneity also has a negative impact on the storage capacity of CO2 and oil production. Notably, as the standard deviation was raised to 0.1, a small sweep region arose with the early CO2 breakthrough, which led to a worse flooding effect.

CO2-Argon-Steam-Oxy (CARSOXY)-fuel gas turbines are an innovative example that integrates CCS with gas turbine powergen improvement. Replacing air-fuel combustion by CARSOXY combustion has been theoretically proven to increase gas turbine efficiency. Therefore, this paper provides a novel approach to continuously supply a gas turbine with a CARSOXY blend within required molar fractions. The approach involves H2 and N2 production, therefore having the potential of also producing ammonia. Thus, the concept allows CARSOXY cycles to be used to support production of ammonia whilst increasing power efficiency. An ASPEN PLUS model has been developed to demonstrate the approach. The model involves the integrations of an air separation unit (ASU), a steam methane reformer (SMR), water gas shift (WGS) reactors, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) units and heat exchanged gas turbines (HXGT) with a CCS unit. Sensitivity analyses were conducted on the ASU-SMR-WGS-PSA-CCS-HXGT model. The results provide a baseline to calibrate the model in order to produce the required CARSOXY molar fraction. A MATLAB code has also been developed to study CO2 compression effects on the CARSOXY gas turbine compressor. Thus, this paper provides a detailed flowsheet of the WGS-PSA-CCS-HXGT model. The paper provides the conditions in which the sensitivity analyses have been conducted to determine the best operable regime for CARSOXY production with other high valuable gases (i.e., hydrogen). Under these specifications, the sensitivity analyses on the (SMR) sub-model spots the H2O mass flow rates, which provides the maximum hydrogen level, the threshold which produces significant CO2 levels. Moreover, splitting the main CH4 supply to sub-supply a SMR reactor and a furnace reactor correlates to best practices for CARSOXY. The sensitivity analysis has also been performed on the (ASU) sub-model to characterise its response with respect to the variation of air flow rate, distillation/boiling rates, product/feed stage locations and the number of stages of the distillation columns.

The heating system components are an exhaust air heat pump, solar collectors and a heat recovery ventilation unit (HRV). The TES is used as heat source during colder periods, which implies improved efficiency and coefficient of performance (COP). Around 70% of electrical resistance heat, assisting an exhaust air heat pump during cold periods, can be substituted with heat from the TES according to the simulation model. Connecting three units in series will increase the usable storage capacity possibilities with by a 49% higher heat output.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "923e5a32c404700ef89394005b531665add7d504", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2588401576", "DOI": "10.5937/ZASMAT1501037R", "CorpusId": 55433269}, "title": "Membrane technology application in the framework of zero emission concept", "abstract": "The Zero emissions concept envisages all industrial inputs being used in final products or converted into value-added inputs for other industries or processes. In this way, industries are reorganized into clusters such that each industry's wastes / by-products are fully matched with the input requirements of another industry, and the integrated whole produces no waste of any kind. This technique is based on the well-established economic analysis tool known as the input/output approach. In the framework of the zero emission concept capture of CO2 plays an important role. CO2 can be captured and permanently stored, or it can be re-used. Carbon sequestration is a two-step process where the capture of CO2 from a gas stream is followed by its permanent storage. The capture step contributes 75% to the overall carbon sequestration process cost. For this reason, the scientific community has paid a great attention to the development of new processes for CO2 capture. Currently, there is a wide range of technologies to separate CO2 from gas streams. They are based on different physical and chemical processes including absorption, adsorption, cryogenics and membrane technology. The choice of a suitable technology depends on the characteristics of the flue gas stream and, as a consequence, on the power plant technology. As an alternative to conventional process es for CO2 separation and capture, membrane technology shows great potentiality for CO2 capture owing to its easy applicability, efficiency, flexibility, ability to maintain high CO2 pressure and to perform separations at low energy penalties. CO2-selective membranes allow separation of CO2 from different gas streams, such as: flue gas (post-combustion system), natural gas (natural gas processing) and hydrogen (pre-combustion systems) or oxygen from nitrogen (in an oxyfuel combustion system). In the framework of zero emission concept, this paper gives an overview and analysis of the types of membranes used and membrane technology application in CO2 capture from the point of cost and energy consumption.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "cd1e5c7679380df90c658c25e761244e7d001d4c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2182467791", "CorpusId": 110080712}, "title": "Seven Simplifications for Models of CO 2 Injection", "abstract": "One attractive option to reduce carbon emissions to the atmosphere is carbon capture and geological storage, or CCGS. In CCGS, carbon dioxide from power plants is captured and subsequently injected into deep geological formations. This leads to a physical system in which multi-component, multi-phase flow occurs with geochemical reactions and complex phase be- havior being additional potentially important processes. While the system is inherently com- plex, several characteristics and properties of the system make it amenable to simplification. We have cataloged seven simplifications that can apply to the injection portion of a CCGS op- eration. Application of some or all of the seven simplifications allows the mathematical de- scription to be simplified, such that easier numerical calculations can be performed and, in some cases, analytical solutions can be derived. These simplifications can form the basis for large- scale simulations that focus on leakage of CO 2 , migration and leakage of displaced brine, and an overall probabilistic risk analysis of the system. An example from Alberta, Canada demon- strates the potential utility of these simplified models.", "year": 2009}]}
