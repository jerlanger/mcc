A still increasing interest and emphasis on the sessile bacterial lifestyle biofilms has been seen since it was realized that that less than 0.1% of the total microbial biomass lives in the planktonic mode of growth. The term was coined in 1978 by Costerton et al. who defined the term biofilm for the first time.In 1993 the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) recognised that the biofilmmode of growth was relevant to microbiology. Lately many articles have been published on the clinical implications of bacterial biofilms. Both original articles and reviews concerning the biofilm problem are available.Annual Reports on NMR Spectroscopy, Volume 97, provides an in-depth accounting of progress in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and its many applications. In recent years, no other technique has gained as much significance. It is used in all branches of science in which precise structural determination is required, and in which the nature of interactions and reactions in solution is being studied.

This book is the first to cover this important emerging topic, and is written for a wide audience encompassing regulators, implementers, academics, and other stakeholders. The book is also of interest to those working on the wider exploitation of the subsurface, such as bioremediation, carbon capture and storage, geothermal energy, and water quality. Planning for suitable facilities in the U.S., Europe, and Asia has been based mainly on knowledge from the geological and physical sciences. However, recent studies have shown that microbial life can proliferate in the inhospitable environments associated with radioactive waste disposal, and can control the long-term fate of nuclear materials.

Due to recent advances in instrumentation, these compounds are being detected in the gas and particle phases, raising questions as to their source, processing and sinks in the environment. With their recently identified role as contributors to aerosol formation and growth, their novel large scale use as solvents in carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology and their emissions from cigarette smoke, it is now important to address the gaps in our understanding of the fate of organic nitrogen. Experimentally and theoretically, I studied the chemical atmospheric fate of specific organic nitrogen compounds in the amine, amide and isocyanate families, yielding information that can be used in chemical transport models to assess the fate of this emerging class of atmospheric molecules. I performed kinetic laboratory studies in a smog chamber to measure the room temperature rate coefficient for reaction with the hydroxyl radical of monoethanolamine, nicotine, and five different amides. I employed online-mass spectrometry techniques to quantify the oxidation products. I found that amines react quickly with OH radicals with lifetimes of a few hours under sunlit conditions, producing amides as oxidation products. My studies on amides revealed that they have much longer lifetimes in the atmosphere, ranging from a few hours to a week. Photo-oxidation of amides produces isocyanates and I investigated these mechanisms in detail using ab initio iii calculations. Furthermore, I experimentally measured isocyanic acid\u2019s Henry\u2019s Law constant as well as its hydrolysis rate constants to better understand its sinks in the atmosphere.

A total of 19 thematic information layers have been utilized to map the study area which reflect the effect of ecology, environment and existent infrastructure towards laying new CO 2 pipeline networks. Weights are assigned to each class in the thematic maps based on their characteristics, capacity of building and maintaining pipelines and the potential environmental risk of CO 2 pipelines from the literature. A tract suitability index is developed which identified Western North Dakota, central Wyoming and Western Montana as regions highly suitable for development of CO 2 pipelines. The study reveals that 54.5% of the region of interest is suitable for pipeline construction while 15.39% of land is classified as either poor or infeasible candidate for locating CO 2 pipelines. It is also revealed that pipeline right-of-way, water bodies and population centres have the most significant impact on future pipeline development.

A combined synchrotron X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric, and microscopy study was carried out to characterize first the physical absorption properties and then to analyze the structural evolution and formation of phases in situ.

Critical to the adoption and ultimate success of CCS is the protection of valuable water resources that may be impacted by leaking CO2 from CCS operations. Therefore, appropriate technical tools and societal controls will need to be developed and evaluated to maximize the atmospheric benefits of CCS while limiting potential deleterious effects of its implementation. Here, we utilize a naturally leaking CO2 system located at Soda Springs, Idaho, USA, as an analogue for industrial\u2010scale CCS deployment. This site is particularly relevant and useful for studying the consequences of CCS because it allows the examination of geologic systems at temporal and spatial scales not accessible by laboratory and field experiments. The Soda Springs system is an ideal CCS natural analogue site with the source of CO2 occurring at depths and temperatures expected for large\u2010scale CCS systems. Soda Springs also provides long\u2010term examples of at least three potential failure modes for CCS systems, including direct migration of CO2 charged brine to the surface via faulting or wells, upward movement of CO2 from the injection\u2010horizon into over lying shallow aquifers, and the displacement of reservoir brine into shallower aquifers. These failure mechanisms were differentiated and characterized utilizing variations in water chemistry including rare earth elements providing a framework for delineating the movement of CO2\u2010influenced fluids migrating from deep CCS reservoirs into overlying aquifers. \u00a9 2020 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "d73cfca1bec544de591342bd8bc85053fe82ee95", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3010114689", "DOI": "10.4337/9781788978477.00014", "CorpusId": 216297944}, "title": "Case study 3: carbon capture and storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "99a297e2d5dc6be5f184a71ac507bb92966113c7", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1007/s11051-021-05221-5", "CorpusId": 234787339}, "title": "Advancement and current scenario of engineering and design in transparent supercapacitors: electrodes and electrolyte", "abstract": "Smart devices such as smartphones, smart watches, smart glasses, and transparent control circuits have captured most of the electronics market worldwide.

Despite the benefits, there have been a limited number of projects solely for CO2 sequestration being implemented. The industry is well-versed in gas injection in reservoir formation for pressure maintenance and improving oil recovery. However, there are striking differences between the injection of CO2 into depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs and the engineered storage of CO2. The differences and challenges are compounded when the storage site is karstified carbonate in offshore and bulk storage volume.\n It is paramount to know upfront that CO2 can be stored at a potential storage site and demonstrate that the site can meet required storage performance safety criteria. Comprehensive screening for site selection has been carried out for suitable CO2 storage sites in offshore Sarawak, Malaysia using geographical, geological, geophysical, geomechanical and reservoir engineering data and techniques for evaluating storage volume, container architecture, pressure, and temperature conditions. The site-specific input data are integrated into static and dynamic models for characterization and generating performance scenarios of the site. In addition, the geochemical interaction of CO2 with reservoir rock has been studied to understand possible changes that may occur during/after injection and their impact on injection processes/mechanisms. Novel 3-way coupled modelling of dynamic-geochemistry-geomechanics processes were carried out to study long-term dynamic behaviour and fate of CO2 in the formation.\n The 3-way coupled modelling helped to understand the likely state of injectant in future and the storage mechanism, i.e., structural, solubility, residual, and mineralized trapping. It also provided realistic storage capacity estimation, incorporating reservoir compaction and porosity/permeability changes. The study indicates deficient localized plastic shear strain in overburden flank fault whilst all the other flaws remained stable. The potential threat of leakage is minimal as target injection pressure is set at initial reservoir pressure, which is much lower than caprock breaching pressure during injection. Furthermore, it was found that the geochemical reaction impact is shallow and localized at the top of the reservoir, making the storage safe in the long term. The integrity of existing wells was evaluated for potential leakage and planned for a proper mitigation plan. Comprehensive measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) were also designed using state-of-art tools and dynamic simulation results. The understanding gaps are closed with additional technical work to improve technologies application and decrease the uncertainties.\n A comprehensive study for offshore CO2 storage projects identifying critical impacting elements is crucial for estimation, injection, containment, and monitoring CO2 plume.

The weak incentives arise from misalignment of interests of the individual entities with the common interest of the project, thus resulting in sub-optimal decisions that do not maximize the overall project value. Contractual risk-sharing is key to aligning the interests of the individual entities and incentivizing them to make optimal decisions. We develop a framework to quantify the impact of the project contract terms on the financial value of large energy capital projects. We focus on a prototype carbon capture and storage (CCS) project wherein the power plant company (that captures the CO2) is linked to the oil field company (that stores the CO2 for enhanced oil recovery, EOR) through a long-term CO2 delivery contract. We evaluate alternate CO2 contract structures in terms of the incentives the contracts provide to the individual entities to respond to changes in the market risk factors (oil price, electricity price, and CO2 emission penalty). The results show that inappropriate risk allocation, as in fixed price CO2 contracts, leads to significant loss in project value. This loss under fixed price CO2 contracts is due to high contracting risks associated with ex post insolvencies and weak incentives for contingent decision-making. We find that risk sharing offered by oil-indexed price CO2 contracts significantly reduces the contracting risks and thus considerably increases the project value compared to a fixed price CO2 contract.

This calls for methods to enhance our understanding of tight reservoirs, such as shale. A large percentage of gas in place in shale reservoirs is in the form of adsorbed gas on the surfaces of pores. The pores of shale reservoirs range from micro-, mesoto macropores. Small pores contribute to large surface area accessible for adsorption, emphasizing the importance of studying pore structure in nanoscale. Subcritical gas adsorption isauseful methodto characterize pore structures in nanoscale in terms of quantifying pore volume, determining the presence of micropores, predicting pore geometries and the accessible surface area for adsorption. This paper discusses results obtained from running adsorption on samples of four different formations: Niobrara shale, Lokpanta oil shale, Hawaiian basaltic rock and Berea sandstone. Some of the results used to both qualitatively and quantitatively study pore structures are isotherm, pore size distribution and specific surface area. These results both affirm and debunk generalizations tied to certain formations. For instance, sandstone typically has large grains and this is confirmed by the zero micropores shown in both its isotherm and pore size distribution. On the contrary, some of the basaltic rocks are expected to have highspecific surface area due to its high clay content, yet the samples showed low specific surface area instead. This informs the lack of information available on the sample, thus, initiating more tests to understand other factors that may be causing low specific surface area. Moreover, Lokpanta oilshale does not have any external information provided, but the isotherms and pore size distribution help to intuitively grasp the image of the samples' pore structures. This paper illustrates how best to analyze and compare the experimental results. Subcritical gas adsorption makes it easy to picture pore structures at nanoscale.

Energy can be stored by using electricity to compress and inject CO2 and previously produced in-situ brine into the subsurface. Later, electricity can be dispatched by producing geothermally-heated CO2 and brine to the surface, and using the heat in these fluids to generate electricity in a direct CO2 power cycle and indirect brine power cycle. As such, CO2-BES operation relies on geothermal heat extraction and subsurface pressure. In addition to being able to permanently isolate large quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere, this process has several advantages compared to conventional BES technologies like Pumped Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) or Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES). For example, the length of time that a PHES or CAES facility can generate electricity at capacity (the hours of storage) is limited by the amount of electricity that was previously stored. In contrast, the hours of storage of a CO2-BES facility is an operational decision; a CO2-BES operator may choose to dispatch electricity at capacity for 1 hour, or over 12 hours, independent of how much electricity was previously stored because the energy in geothermal resources is depleted over the course of decades, not hours or days. Despite this advantage, the operational decision of how many hours to discharge and store electricity may impact the functionality of a CO2-BES facility over the 30-year facility lifetime by altering the overpressure in the reservoir or the rate at which the energy in geothermal resource is extracted. In this way, the charging and discharging durations may impact the power capacity (the maximum amount of power than can be generated at any one time) and round-trip efficiency (the ratio of energy dispatched to energy stored) of a CO2-BES facility over the 30-year operational lifetime. For example, if operating with a cycle of 16-hour discharge, 8-hour charge depletes the geothermal heat or overpressure in the subsurface more than a 4-hour discharge, 4-hour charge cycle does, it may be more profitable over the life of the facility to maintain shorter cycle frequencies.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "54b3df325ef39cd862aedbc0e3a66cca7643b21d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2226699793", "DOI": "10.1007/S12665-009-0398-5", "CorpusId": 129962962}, "title": "Foreword to the Special Issue on Zero Emission Research and Technology Center testing field site, Bozeman, Montana, USA", "abstract": "Carbon capture and storage in geologic formations is considered an important emerging technology for mitigating global climate change.

Because of that, we investigate chemical corrosion of rocks and rock-forming minerals with impure supercritical CO2 (scCO2) at possible storage conditions of >73.7 bar and >31\u00b0C. Contaminates were chosen with respect to the composition of CO2 captured industrially from coal-fired power plants using the oxyfuel technology. The resulting data should build a base for the long-term prediction of the behavior of CO2 in geologic storage reservoirs. Experiments of up to 1000 hrs duration have been performed with 10 natural mineral concentrates (calcite, dolomite, siderite, anhydrite, hematite, albite, microcline, kaolinite, muscovite, biotite) in 3n NaCl solution and pure scCO2 or scCO2+SO2 (99.5+0.5 vol%). The NaCl reaction fluid resembles the average salinity of deep formation waters of the North German Basin and is not free of oxygen. To increase reaction rates all minerals were ground and the reagents agitated either by stirring or shaking in autoclaves of about one liter in volume. The autoclaves consist of HastelloyTM or ferromagnetic stainless steel fully coated with PTFE. We used in average 15 g of solids, 700 ml liquid, and the vessels were pressurized up to 100 bars with CO2 or CO2-SO2 mixture. Experiments were run at temperatures up to 90\u00b0C. Before, during and after the experiments small amounts fluids were sampled and analyzed for dissolved constituents and pH. Solid phases were characterized by XRF, XRD, and EMPA before and after the experiments. Pure scCO2 corrodes all carbonates, reacts only slightly with anhydrite, albite, and microcline at a minimum pH of 4, and does not recognizably interact with the others. After the experiment, albite has gained in a, not yet fully identified, carbonate phase which might be dawsonite. Reaction fluids of the experiments with scCO2+SO2 have mostly lower pH than using scCO2 alone, at which those with silicate phases have a lower pH (between 2 and 3) than experiments with carbonates. Fluidmineral-interactions using scCO2-SO2 are thus much stronger and the concentrations of SO4 and cations in the reacting fluids are generally much higher, especially for Fe, Si and Al of silicates. However, intensity and rate of reactions are controlled by the availability of SO2 and apparently buffered by dissolution and precipitation processes.

The South West Hub Project led by the Department of Mines, Industry Regulation and Safety (DMIRS) in Western Australia has been investigating and characterising the Lesueur sandstone as a potential target injection and storage formation since 2007. As expected with an unconfined saline aquifer, the project started with limited data, particularly when compared to sites based in oil and gas field areas. Working with research institutions and private sector expertise the project has judiciously acquired data on a stage gated decision basis. Starting with a 2D seismic over 110 line-km in 2011 and a deep well to 2,945 metres in 2012 the project was able to move through various modelling stages and uncertainty tables, before undertaking a complex 3 D seismic over 115km in 2014 and then drilling three \u201cshallow to intermediate depth wells\u201d (1,350m, 1550m and 1,800m) in 2015 that gave good areal coverage, significant core and logging data on targeted critical sub-surface formations.

Security of secondary containment is considered through the overlying paleosol packages in the Yalgorup Member, a 800M thick sequence of sand and paleosol deposits. Project activities are supported by R&D activities conducted under Australian National Low Emissions Coal Research and Development (ANLEC R&D). These projects are focused on reservoir characterization and either consider more fundamental physics based questions or delve significantly deeper into specific geology and geophysics domains using laboratory and modelling efforts. On occasion high resolution seismic, multi-offset VSP\u2019s and other data has been acquired over targeted areas to illuminate certain parts of the reservoir. The research work is not the basis of project decision making but supportive to project efforts and complements private sector work through regular information exchange.

The geo-cellular models were very large with the upscaled simulation models requiring significant run times with a compositional simulator. While multiple scenarios were simulated, uncertainties remained and these were addressed in a detailed Uncertainty Management Plan (UMP), In accordance with the UMP, the Generation 4 model development commenced in late 2017 with further input from re-processed seismic, new core analysis, different analytical techniques and re-interpretation of well log data. The work scope and the key objectives of this model are to: (a) challenge assumptions and conclusions of underlying interpretation work reviewed/performed to date; (b) reduce parametric uncertainties through analog studies and new laboratory test data; (c) develop scenarios and use a range of cases to test storage performance factors and potential limits (injectivity, containment and capacity) going beyond the decision criteria. Industrial workflows and specific research projects have been converging on the parametric uncertainties. The current models are building on the cumulative body of knowledge developed over the last decade. This paper reviews the latest uncertainty mapping and the work program developed to extract the maximum information from already collected field data, building on the previous work by different forms of advanced seismic processing and interpretat ion; correlation of log data with previous and new core data; reviewing geo-mechanical stress fields and rock physics in the target reservoir; updating geological and engineering aspects of the data, particularly that of the depositional structures of the paleosols in the overlying Yalgorup Member and; utilising Black Oil as well as Compositional models to improve the efficiency of the dynamic modelling. However, the major uncertainty remains around the deep reservoir properties and the CO2 behaviour at the target injection depth up to 3,200m. The strength and robustness of the latest modelling will assist in a decision to drill and test that deeper well.

In order to avoid severe consequences to mankind, immediate action has to take place in developing new technologies and solutions. Carbon Capture and Storage, CCS, has emerged as a suitable method in preventing CO2 emissions to reach the atmosphere, essentially by capturing it from large sources and storing it. Options for long-term isolation of CO2 include ocean storage, which may encompass adversities such as water acidification, or geological storage. Biological fixation of CO2 can be seen as a different approach to CCS, in which instead of storing the previously captured CO2, it would be used as a reactant in the photosynthetic process, much as in the case of a natural sink. Since microalgae have extraordinary properties, such as high proliferation rates, tolerance to extreme environments, among others, they are preferred as the biological fixation medium. Carbon dioxide emissions derived from large stationary sources, such as power stations, cement production and refineries, require large areas for the implementation of reactors. Such areas may not be available in the immediacy of the industrial complex and therefore require the transportation of the gas until its biofixation location. Three distinct scenarios for CO2 transportation in the specific case of microalgae production were proposed. Case A, supposes the transportation of a highly concentrated stream of CO2, whereas in Case B the gas transported is the one directly collected from flue gas stacks. The separation process inherent to Case A for the treatment of the flue gas involves higher energy consumption and also higher costs, when compared to Case B, in which the gas is simply fed to the reactors without the separation. Despite that fact and since Case B involves a stream of around 12% of CO2, a larger volume of gas has to be transported, and so, costs are increased for the same quantity of CO2. Case C assumes the transportation of CO2 dissolved in water, which would work as a part of the culture medium and therefore would not require the transportation of an extra stream of water. Therefore, an analysis is necessary for comparing the costs of transportation of these three scenarios, so as to decide which would represent the best option. Preliminary economic analysis of carbon dioxide transportation for microalgae production For the cases present previously a general optimization of design parameters was performed and a preliminary economic evaluation of the three different scenarios for the transportation of CO2 from critical emission sources until the reactor\u2019s location was prepared. The results of the evaluation show that the lowest cost transportation is attained by the transmission of a relatively pure stream of CO2.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "2e5d7bfc0bed30b8a1916a5aa6b99f757659ddfc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1671817243", "DOI": "10.36487/ACG_REP/1208_13_FOURIE", "CorpusId": 55887124}, "title": "The fallacy of designing for in-perpetuity: geotechnical presumptions, ecosystem responses and concepts for managing inevitable change", "abstract": "The design requirement for the performance of covers to tailings storage facilities and waste rock dumps is increasingly being stipulated as being \u2018in-perpetuity\u2019.

Geotechnical systems such as earth dams, slopes and foundations, which typically have design lives of 50\u201270\u00a0years, are designed on the basis of engineering properties measured during and immediately after the design and construction process. Implicit in this approach is the assumption that these properties do not change with time.

We give examples of how the initial geotechnical design assumptions are not stable and will inevitably change as the system evolves. \nTypically, starting from an inert biologically barren system, through the process of carbon fixation (photosynthesis) and energy capture, the biological, chemical and physical properties of these structures will change.

Thus, innovative designs often break common visual habits and are evaluated as relatively unattractive at first sight (Leder & Carbon, 2005). In most empirical studies, attractiveness is measured only once. These measures do not capture the dynamic aspects of innovation. This paper presents a dynamic procedure, the Repeated Evaluation Technique (RET), that improves the validity of attractiveness evaluations. RET simulates time and exposure effects of everyday life. Using RET, we investigated the appreciation of different car designs varying in innovativeness and curvature. While the mere exposure theory (Zajonc, 1968) would predict a general increase of liking in increasing exposure, RET revealed dissociate effects depending on innovativeness. Only innovative designs showed an increase in attractiveness. Low innovative designs were rated as being relatively attractive in the beginning, but did not profit from elaboration due to RET.

Computationally-efficient procedures including numerical reduced-order models, which have been applied in related areas such as oil reservoir simulation, may thus be very useful in this regard.

For subsequent (test) runs, which involve different well control settings, the solution at each time step is represented based on a linearization around a training solution. The use of POD, along with a constraint reduction procedure, which projects the set of governing equations into a low-dimensional subspace, provides a high degree of efficiency.

Soaring prices for conventional energy, the depletion of natural resources and the problem of greenhouse gas emissions have sparked greater interest in and use of both nonconventional and renewable energy sources. Indeed, the transition from oil to multiple energy sources is expected to accelerate in the 21st century. According to conventional thinking, green (environmental) considerations and economic growth are at odds with one another. However, so-called Green Growth is the right way to approach the era of multiple energy sources. This is a virtuous cycle in which protecting the environment can be perceived as a new growth opportunity, and this new growth, in turn, can preserve the environment still more. Countries around the world are already rushing to capitalize on new opportunities that are being created by the environmental industry. Green growth is progressing in 3 main directions: (1) energy source diversification, (2) energy efficiency improvement, and (3) CO2 reduction. Energy source diversification is being led by emission-free coal, FPSO-GTL, marine-based biofuels, next-generation solar cells, and nuclear power. Meanwhile, energy efficiency is being enhanced through advancements in plug-in hybrid vehicles and fuel cell power generation.

The point of departure of this research is the notion that climate engineering (CE) is not inherently morally wrong. The guiding question is: Is there a possible buying time deployment of a climate engineering technology absent any general moral constraints? This question will be answered in several steps: First, a deductively valid version of the BT-argument is established.\u00a0 In particular, this argument implies that deployment of CE is to be finite and should not interfere with mitigation efforts.

The production of bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) is one class of CDR technology (2), involving the capture and geologic storage of CO2 (CCS) that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere from use of biomass as a fuel for electricity generation or feedstock for production of liquid fuels. Use of CCS typically imposes two energy penalties that can diminish its benefits: energy is needed to separate CO2 from dilute CO2-containing mixtures (e.g. flue gas), and to liquefy CO2 so that it can be transported and injected into geologic formations. The predominant biofuel production pathway in the United States (U.S.) today is conversion of corn starch to ethanol, which generates relatively high-concentration CO2 from fermentation and dilute-CO2 from fuel combustion for process heat.

However, change in energy system is slow and many of the challenges that we face such as mitigating climate change need global solutions. Energy system models with long time span and global reach provide a way to analyse questions related to these challenges. This thesis focuses on capturing the role of nuclear power and variable renewables in global long term energy models. Papers I, II and IV assess the potential role nuclear power can play in global climate mitigation as well as identify the determining factors of this contribution whereas Paper III looks at the possible effects of phase out of Swedish nuclear power on European CO2 emissions and electricity prices. We show that nuclear power can reduce the climate change mitigation cost if allowed to remain or expand. The main factors determining the cost reduction potential are availability and cost of carbon capture and storage and cost of renewable and nuclear technologies. However, to decide whether to allow for a large scale expansion of nuclear power, the observed cost savings must be weighed against increased risks of accidental radiation releases from reactor operation, waste storage and nuclear weapons proliferation. To make this decision economic as well as non-economic factors should also be considered. To analyse such concerns we use post analysis of model scenarios in Paper I to assess the nuclear power expansion\u2019s effect on nuclear weapons\u2019 proliferation and apply the multi-criteria model analysis (MCMA) method in Paper IV to actively include criteria such as proliferation concern and energy security into optimisation. We find that MCMA method significantly improves the analysis of attainability of multiple simultaneous goals such in large-scale energy-systems models compared to simple scenario analysis that is presented in Paper I. The approach is more intuitive and requires minimal mathematical skills on the part of the user. MCMA method also avoids infeasible or dominated solutions that are caused by the stringent constraints applied in parametric optimisation. Paper V presents a method for capturing the effects of intermittency induced by variable renewables into the power system. Our results show that this approach manages to capture many aspects such as need for flexible generation capacity and curtailment at high penetration levels. We also find optimal electricity production mixes to vary significantly between regions due to different endowments of solar and wind resources. We show that adding electricity storage to the system will favour solar power but has only a minor effect on wind and nuclear power.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "aca31fbabff08ee6f0e26ecfec1ec55263f8c0b4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2567589074", "DOI": "10.3390/LAND5040046", "CorpusId": 15340154}, "title": "Greenhouse Gas Implications of Peri-Urban Land Use Change in a Developed City under Four Future Climate Scenarios", "abstract": "Present decisions about urbanization of peri-urban (PU) areas may contribute to the capacity of cities to mitigate future climate change. Comprehensive mitigative responses to PU development should require integration of urban form and food production to realise potential trade-offs. Despite this, few studies examine greenhouse gas (GHG) implications of future urban development combined with impacts on PU food production. In this paper, four future scenarios, at 2050 and 2100 time horizons, were developed to evaluate the potential GHG emissions implications of feeding and housing a growing urban population in Sydney, Australia. The scenarios were thematically downscaled from the four relative concentration pathways. Central to the scenarios were differences in population, technology, energy, housing form, transportation, temperature, food production and land use change (LUC). A life cycle assessment approach was used within the scenarios to evaluate differences in GHG impacts. Differences in GHG emissions between scenarios at the 2100 time horizon, per area of PU land transformed, approximated 0.7 Mt CO2-e per year. Per additional resident this equated to 0.7 to 6.1 t CO2-e per year. Indirect LUC has the potential to be significant.

The US Department of Energy estimates that 67 billion STB of economically recoverable next-generation CO2-EOR oil exist in US conventional reservoirs, with significant potential identified in other oil provinces around the world.\n This situation may be about to change. On 9 February, Congress passed and the president signed into law a budget agreement that included language to expand a 2009 tax credit for CO2 capture and storage known as 45Q. The key provisions are that, for stored CO2, the tax credit rises to $50 per tonne in 2027, while, for EOR, the equivalent value is $35. The amounts will be adjusted for inflation after 2026. The tax credit is per tonne of CO2 captured as long as it can be established that the CO2 was stored. The tax credit is transferable, hence nontax-paying entities or entities that have no tax liability can benefit from the program. The credit goes to the facility that captures the CO2 and is available for the first 12 years of operation. There is no cap on the arrangement for the tax-credit projects coming online after 2018 or for which construction has started before 2024.\n As a result, the US now has a carbon-pricing mechanism that could well be enough to unlock a wave of innovative CO2-capture projects and lead to a significant expansion in CO2 EOR, ultimately leading to new infrastructure, storage sites, and technology improvements that give birth to a CO2-capture industry.\n Recommended additional reading at OnePetro: www.onepetro.org.\n SPE 185526 Surveillance and Initial Results of an Existing Polymer Flood: A Case History From the Rayoso Formation by L.A.

Coal-fired power has progressed from being the cheapest to one of the most expensive sources of electricity in the United States, and while it will remain an important source of electricity for decades, it is projected to be in \u201cterminal decline\u201d by 2020. The Donald J. Trump Administration may prolong the transition away from coal, but the underlying economics will prevent its reversal. Three factors are driving this transformation: (1) dramatic declines in the cost of renewables; (2) the projected long-term low price of natural gas; and (3) strong signs that electricity storage will be widely cost-competitive by the mid-2020s. I have omitted environmental and climate change regulations because, though important, their status is highly uncertain in the near term given the current political climate in the United States. The changes in the electricity sector necessitate a reevaluation of the strategy for deploying CCS that is built around coal-fired generation. If, as many energy experts believe, rising market competition is inexorably undercutting the viability of coal-fired generation, plans and policies for CCS must adapt to the new economic realities. The greatest barrier to deployment of CCS is the low price of natural gas, which is displacing coal-fired generation and foreclosing the construction of new plants \u2014 a factor also independent of the expected demise of President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan. At the same time, the cost of renewables and electricity storage are projected to continue their decline and to reach grid parity long before widespread commercialization of CCS. As a consequence, even under optimistic scenarios coal plants with CCS will have to compete in a market increasingly dominated by technologies with more rapid innovation cycles, modularity, and low barriers to deployment at both the utility-scale and as distributed generation.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "2f7c338f01e44a4dd3b06cfa6e71316ef9c30fe4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2316533391", "DOI": "10.1190/SEGAM2013-1212.1", "CorpusId": 54071954}, "title": "Theoretical detectability of CO2 at a CCS project in Alberta", "abstract": "Summary A time-lapse analysis was carried out to investigate the theoretical detectability of CO2 for the Shell Quest project. Quest is a Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) project in Alberta operated by Shell Canada Energy and its partners. The target formation for injection is the Basal Cambrian Sandstone (BCS) which is a deep saline aquifer at an approximate depth of 2000 meters below surface in the Quest project area. The purpose of this study was to simulate the seismic response of the BCS after injecting 1.2 million tonnes of CO2 during a one-year period of injection. This was done using Gassmann fluid substitution and seismic forward modeling. A geological model for the baseline scenario was generated based on logs from well SCL-8-19-59-20W4. For the monitor case, Gassmann fluid substitution modeling was undertaken to model a CO2 plume within BCS.

Along with low carbon sources, a suitable alternative is carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology which allows us to continue fossil fuel based electricity generation at much lower rates of emission. Carbon capture can either be applied to new power plants or incorporated into existing ones. A case study on Indian power sector is carried out aiming to find a minimum investment energy mix for the year 2020 with 2007 as base year. For a primary analysis, the CCS parasitic load is assumed to be 20% of total capacity. In this study, the fraction of coal existing coal power plants to be retrofitted and the capacity factor of existing power plants are allowed to vary, along with the installed capacity needed from various types of new power plants. The constraints are those imposed by emission limit, energy demand, and the maximum capacity possible from various power sources. As power capacity and capacity factor are variable, the model turns out to be nonlinear. It was seen that a case allowing retrofitting is more economically viable than the scenario which does not. A sensitivity analysis on emission constraint shows that as the emission constraint was varied from 90% to 60% of 2007 levels, the fraction of existing power plants to be retrofitted varied from 16% to 53%. Also, as parasitic load is varied from 10% to 40% of total, the overall share of retrofitted power plants in the total mix varied from 11% to 7.5%.

When carbon is removed from forests through harvest, a portion of the harvested carbon is stored in wood products, often for many decades. The United States Forest Service (USFS) and other agencies are interested in accurately accounting for carbon flux associated with harvested wood products (HWP) to meet greenhouse gas monitoring commitments and climate change adaptation and mitigation objectives. National-level forest carbon accounting has been in place for over a decade, but there is an increasing need for accounting for smaller scale administrative units, including USFS National Forest System regions and individual National Forests. This paper uses the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) production accounting approach to estimate HWP carbon storage from 1909 to 2012 for the USFS Sierra Nevada Bio-Regional Assessment Area (Assessment Area) of the Pacific Southwest Region. For the Assessment Area as a whole, carbon stocks in the HWP pool were increasing at just above 0.5 million megagrams of carbon (MgC) per year beginning in the late 1940's until the early 1990's, with peak cumulative storage to date of 32 million MgC occurring in 1999. Net positive flux into the HWP pool over this period is primarily attributable to high harvest levels during the 1960's through 1980's. In the years between the late 1960s and 1990 timber harvest were at high but volatile levels, with high harvests of over 2.5 million ccf (1.8 million MgC) occurring six times during this period, harvest levels from National Forests have since declined to less than 0.7 million ccf (0.5 million MgC) per year, resulting in less carbon entering the HWP pool. Since 2000, emissions from HWP at solid waste disposal sites exceeded additions from harvesting, resulting in a decline in the total amount of carbon stored in the HWP pool. The Assessment Area's HWP pool is now in a period of negative net annual stock change because the decay of products harvested between 1909 and 2012 exceeds additions of carbon to the HWP pool through harvest. Together with estimates of ecosystem carbon, which are also being developed through the Forest Management Carbon Framework (ForCaMF), Regional level estimates of HWP carbon flux can be used to inform management decisions and guide climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts by the agency. Though our emphasis is on the Assessment Area, this accounting method can be applied more broadly at smaller land management units, such as National Forests.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "a2f813f0a859dc666284e9466011aaf3b8e114f7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2337608971", "DOI": "10.31514/RLIBERATO.2011V12N17.P39", "CorpusId": 111832082}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) - t\u00e9cnicas aplicadas \u00e0 produ\u00e7\u00e3o de cimento 1", "abstract": "The Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) techniques are extremely important for reducing emission of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere.

However, in case of massive accidental leak of CO2, this substance could be the origin of toxic effects for human. Now, carbon dioxide concentrations considered as potentially toxic get close to 10 0000 ppm. To estimate precisely the distances reached by this hazardous level of concentrations, an efficient understanding of the CO2 release phenomena, from the assessment of the mass flow rate to the atmospheric dispersion, is necessary. Whereas the carbon dioxide is often stored and handled under 2-phase or supercritical conditions associated to storage pressure, CO2 ice formation is possible in case of accidental leak in the atmosphere due to specific properties regarding its triple point. Then, this CO2 flakes creation may be followed by the liquid/solid CO2 pool formation on the ground. Due to the important pressure drop of the fluid during the leak, a significant expansion phase, a high rate of air entrainment and a huge temperature drop followed by a dense and cold cloud formation should be considered. Concerning these specific points, a few of atmospheric dispersion softwares take into account the carbon dioxide specific conditions of release.
