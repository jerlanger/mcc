During the proposed CO2 injection process, application of suitable techniques for monitoring of the induced changes in the subsurface is required. Existing models for the spreading of the CO2, as well as displacement processes or resulting issues from mutual solubility between brine and CO2 associated with saturation changes, need to be checked. For well logging in cased boreholes only a limited number of techniques such as radiometric pulsed neutron-gamma (PNG) logging are applicable. The main PNG derived parameters are the macroscopic capture cross section (\u03a3) and the neutron porosity (TPHI) of the formation. The high measurement contrast between brine and CO2 results in a high sensitivity to evaluate saturation changes. Previously, the conventional PNG saturation model based on a displacement process has been used for PNG interpretation in di erent CO2 storage projects in saline aquifers (e.g. Murray et al., 2010; M\u00fcller et al., 2007; Sakurai et al., 2005; Xue et al., 2006). The displacement saturation model accounts for mixing of the uids in the pore space but ignores any mutual physico-chemical interaction. In addition to the displacement process, the mutual solubility between brine and CO2 adds further complex processes such as evaporation and salt precipitation. Evaporation and precipitation processes are relevant in the vicinity of an injection well, where dry CO2 enters the reservoir. Moreover, modeling results show that gravity-forced up ow of CO2 and capillary-forced back ow of brine toward the injection point can also a ect saturation changes and salt precipitation (e.g. Pruess and M\u00fcller 2009). The \u03a3 brine value depends strongly on the brine salinity e.g. its chlorine content which makes PNG measurements suitable for evaporation and salt precipitation monitoring. Until now evaporation and precipitation processes are not considered in PNG saturation models. For this purpose an extended PNG saturation model for NaCl-brines is developed. The extended PNG saturation model includes both the displacement and evaporation/precipitation processes weighted by their a ected porosity proportions. Two scenarios are distinguished. If the repeat \u03a3 value is smaller than the baseline \u03a3 value, rst the displacement saturation model and subsequently the evaporation/precipitation saturation model are applied to the a ected porosity proportions. If the repeat \u03a3 value is greater than the baseline \u03a3 value, the pore uid \u03a3 value is increased corresponding to an increased salt load due to capillary e ects. For this purpose, TPHI can be used to derive CO2 saturation and \u03a3 is used to derive brine and/or halite saturation. Ketzin, the only German pilot test site for CO2 storage in saline aquifers, has one injection and two observation wells, where an extensive PNG monitoring program is performed. For the observation well, which is further away from the injection well, the conventional displacement saturation model is valid. In contrast, the observation well closest to the injection well shows that, in addition to displacement, the evaporation/precipitation process may have occurred in some depth intervals. For the injection well, both scenarios occur. The halite saturation distribution in the injection well seems to be controlled by the combined e ects of changing injection rates associated with changing brine levels, lithology heterogeneities, and di erent saturation changing processes such as evaporation/precipitation or capillary forces. Such salt precipitations were previously not detected in situ in connection with CO2 injection", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "ce54d4e6a36245895d7a728da9b4752eee46a23f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3009709660", "DOI": "10.1144/M52-2019-47", "CorpusId": 225963029}, "title": "The Endurance CO2 storage site, Blocks 42/25 and 43/21, UK North Sea", "abstract": "Abstract The Endurance, four-way, dip-closed structure in UK Blocks 42/25 and 43/21 occurs over a salt swell diapir and within Triassic and younger strata.

Equally important, these nations maintain a degree of institutional capacity that could lower the risks associated with deploying emergent energy technologies such as advanced nuclear or carbon capture and storage. The complexity, expense, and scrutiny that come with building these facilities make them infeasible choices for most nations. This paradigm is slowly changing, as the pressing need for low-carbon electricity generation and ongoing efforts to develop modular nuclear and carbon capture technologies have opened the door for potentially wider markets, including in nations without substantial institutional capacity. Here, using advanced nuclear technologies as our testbed, we develop new methods to evaluate national readiness for deploying complex energy infrastructure. Specifically, we use Data Envelopment Analysis-a method that eliminates the need for expert judgment-to benchmark performance across nations. We find that approximately 80% of new nuclear deployment occurs in nations that are in the top two quartiles of institutional and economic performance. However, 85% of potential low-carbon electricity demand growth is in nations that are in the bottom two quartiles of performance. We offer iconic paradigms for deploying nuclear power in each of these clusters of nations if the goal is to mitigate risk.

The symposium was organized by Prof. Ying Li at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Prof. Fanxing Li at North Carolina State University. It was the largest symposium among the twenty symposia within the Division of Energy and Fuels at the 245th ACS National Meeting & Exposition. A total of 80 invited and contributed talks were presented at the symposium. Topics included fundamentals in CO2 activation and advanced processes and materials for CO2 capture, sequestration, conversion, and utilization.\nAnthropogenic CO2 emission from fossil energy conversion is one of the major contributors to global climate change. With projected increase in global energy consumption, advanced carbon capture, sequestration, and utilization approaches need to be developed. As a first step for CO2 mitigation, carbon capture can potentially be achieved, in a cost-effective manner, through new technologies that reduce the energy consumptions for separating diluted CO2 from conventional power plant flue gas. Alternatively, smart combustion or gasification processes such as oxy-fuel or chemical-looping are capable of producing concentrated CO2 for easy capture. Successful development and deployment of these aforementioned technologies require breakthroughs in advanced materials as well as innovative reactor concepts and process schemes. Sequestration of captured CO2 into geological formations such as saline aquifers is the next important step to ensure long term storage of CO2. Besides sequestration, a number of emerging ideas have shown promise to recycle and utilize CO2 as a carbon source for clean energy carriers or chemicals, mainly through catalytic processes. While CO2 is thermodynamically stable, renewable energy sources like solar can accomplish the challenging task of CO2 conversion and utilization. For example, it has been demonstrated that nanostructured photocatalysts are capable of converting CO2 and water into C1 fuels like CO, methane or methanol under solar radiation. Extensive research efforts are underway to enhance the CO2 conversion efficiency using these novel photocatalytic processes.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "b08a3ee762f7b0403a4c93eae51c504f527c14be", "externalIds": {"MAG": "102951770", "CorpusId": 107263739}, "title": "Investigation of CO2 avoidance behaviour of membrane capture in post combustion processes", "abstract": "Increasing concern for the environment and taxes on carbon dioxide emissions has intensified the development of non-polluting energy supply technologies. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) constitute a promising option that can reduce CO2 emissions significantly. State-of-the-art CO2 capture techniques require very high investment costs which will lead to a substantial drop in power plant efficiency.\nThis thesis focuses on energetic and economical investigations of gas separation membrane systems used for post-combustion capture in coal fired power plants. The simulations were carried out with the commercial software packages PRO/II and Aspen Plus. A reference power plant termed the Reference Power Plant North Rhine-Westphalia was chosen for the analyses.\nOn the basis of two membrane cascades, developed by using an ideal flue gas of CO2 and N2, the investigation was carried out using a quasi real flue gas, composed of CO2, N2, O2, H2O and Ar. Although the water content in the flue gas leads to higher energy consumption, a positive effect can be observed: using the same membrane area as in the case with ideal flue gas, the degree of CO2 separation is increased owing to the sweep gas effect of the water content.\nA detailed heat exchanger investigation was explored for a chosen cascade. The aim was to ensure that the recovered exhaust heat generated from the compression process is sufficient to reheat the retentate in the expansion process. A modification distinguished from the ideal flue gas system was to keep the pressure ratio constant for each pressure section. This makes it possible to have a uniform intercooler design for each stage. A pressure drop of 30 mbar inside each cooler was investigated. This extensive system design results in an energy demand of 292 kWh/tonseparated CO2, a separation degree of 78% and an efficiency loss of 7.9%-points. The system has an energetic advantage in comparison with the MEA absorption method at the same degree of CO2 separation.\nOn the basis of the reference power plant, a comprehensive economic analysis was made, both for CO2 capture cost and CO2 avoidance cost. The results manifest that the heat exchanger cost has a small influence on the total capture cost, which is dominated by the membrane cost in the process. A probable future CO2 emission policy was considered and the CO2 emission cost was included in the calculation. By evaluating the electricity price of the different cases (the reference power plant, the chosen cascade for CO2 capture and the chosen cascade for CO2 avoidance), it was found that high CO2 permeance membranes with long life time and a cheap manufacturing price should be developed to make membrane capture systems more economically competing.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "dab96b026b1c6aa00072a36cc26fa7d22555c942", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2296398674", "DOI": "10.2118/176021-PA", "CorpusId": 155184101}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Storage\u2014Hard-To-Pass Decision Gates", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "54bd21210c49eeeb984c01848ac0ad42afcb7e2e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2488157050", "DOI": "10.1201/B13974-28", "CorpusId": 99780844}, "title": "Coal-Fired Oxy-Fuel Technology for Carbon Capture and Storage", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "4a1b571f5eefcc8158a19cd3c5f6429baf4ab6e7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2610879892", "CorpusId": 135286769}, "title": "Oxygen and carbon isotope systematics during natural mineral carbonation in peridotite of the Samail Ophiolite, Oman", "abstract": "We are investigating peridotite alteration in the mantle \nsection of the Samail ophiolite in Oman.

The solvent based absorption/desorption is clearly the most mature option within this technology, there remain many attempts to make this process economically more viable by reducing the projected capital and operating costs. The capital costs can be reduced by equipment downsizing which can be achieved by increasing the absorption/desorption rate, since a smaller mass transfer interface is needed in the absorber/desorber (resulting in smaller dimensions). Another approach is the use of solvents with low heats of reaction which can reduce the energy requirement for the regeneration process of the solvent and thereby lower the operating costs that make the biggest contribution to the overall cost.

This study investigates the effect of operating a natural gas combined cycle plant coupled with carbon capture and storage while using varying fuel compositions, with a strong focus on the influence of the CO2 concentration in the fuel. The novelty of this study lies in exploring the technical and economic performance of the integrated system, whilst operating with different fuel compositions. The study reports the design of a natural gas combined cycle gas turbine and CO2 capture plant (with 30\u2009wt% monoethanolamine), which were modelled using the gCCS process modelling application.

Based on a two-year-long empirical research, the paper focuses on exploring the P2M technology deployment potential in different commercial environments. Results are interpreted within the theoretical framework of disruptiveness. It is concluded that P2M has unique attributes because of renewable gas production, grid balancing, and combined long-term energy storage with decarbonization, which represent substantial innovation. Nevertheless, empirical data suggest that the largest P2M plants can be deployed at industrial facilities where CO2 can be sourced from flue gas.

Over the years, and notably since 2003, the government has promulgated a series of policies intended to constrain coal consumption, promote the use of non-fossil fuels, reduce air pollution, and enhance energy efficiency. These measures include improving the efficiency of coal-fired power stations and industrial plants, switching from coal to gas, testing carbon capture and storage or use, and boosting the share of low-carbon energy sources in the power sector. These strategies have met with a high degree of success, due mainly to the rigorous application of administrative policy instruments and subsidies. The country has great potential for the further deployment of wind and solar energy, as well as scope to boost the share of natural gas. The key determinants of the pace at which China reduces its use of fossil fuels in absolute terms are two-fold. First is the rate of economic growth. Coal has long been the swing fuel and an increase in economic growth has always boosted coal consumption. The second key variable is the mix of market and administrative policy instruments deployed.

If multiple species are present, each \u201cspecies\u201d or functional type is represented as a collection of physiological traits. We recently have been exploring the physiological responses of co-occurring plant species of a variety of growth forms to determine how many separate physiological types are needed in order to capture the dynamics of net primary production, decomposition, carbon (C) storage and nitrogen (N) availability. We measured species-level photosynthetic responses, canopy light extinction, leaf N and lignin, and soil nutrient processes. In both the prairie and the shrub-savanna we found that photosynthetic responses scale with light within the plant canopy such that for calculation of C gain, the canopy can be modeled as a single unit, regardless of the vertical distribution of species. Nutrient cycling and C storage are, however, very different in herbaceous areas compared to wooded areas, such that shrub-dominated areas have different soil C levels and N mineralization rates from grassland areas. In Texas, shrub-dominated areas have higher soil C and N mineralization. The dominant woody plant in the Texas site is an N fixer. Significant areal expansion of this plant, documented since the mid-1800s, has undoubtedly affected regional patterns of N cycling and net primary production (NPP) (similar to results of Vitousek and Walker, 1989, from Hawaii). The dominant woody plant in Kansas is not a fixer and invasion (which is locally common due to fire suppression) results in losses of N availability and stored C. We suggest that some ecosystem processes may be modeled successfully with highly aggregated models, particularly models of processes that are highly constrained by environmental factors. Other processes will require detailed specification of physiological traits at the species or population level. The degree of species aggregation in ecosystem models should be regarded as a research problem rather than a quasi-ideological problem.", "year": 1995}, {"paperId": "7079b01ac1683b1fe5a78a7df6d5d177dd0b27a3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1964920190", "DOI": "10.5012/BKCS.2011.32.7.2489", "CorpusId": 93813581}, "title": "Non-framework Coordination Polymers With Tunable Bimodal Porosities Based on Inter-connected Metal-organic Polyhedra", "abstract": "One discerns coordination polymers (CPs) and metalorganic frameworks (MOFs) because the former provides a more comprehensive concept for network solids based on metal ions and multitopic organic ligands, while the latter implies the presence of a crystal lattice in the structure. MOF materials with three-dimensional backbones and welldefined network structures possess many advantages compared to their non-framework analogues, such as homogeneous and reproducible material properties, and atomlevel information on the structures. However, the labile nature of some coordination bonds, such as those between first-row transition elements and carboxylate ligands may lead to a gradual or even complete degradation of the scaffold under ambient conditions. For most MOFs, therefore, the sustainability of the crystal lattice is a prerequisite to realize the fascinating potentials of these materials, including hydrogen storage or carbon capture and sequestration. Consequently, it is desirable to have a new type of materials that possess the advantages of porous MOFs but without the constraint of an ordered crystal lattice. Approaches taken in this direction include polymerizations using rigid building blocks such as phthalocyanins, liquid-crystal templation and the derivation of disordered structures using rapid precipitation methods. We provide a potential alternative in another perspective, and hereby report some examples of non-framework CPs that have intrinsic porosities tunable between microporous and mesoporous regimes. The idea is based on the realization that some of the well-known metal-organic polyhedral cages are equipped with solvent-coordinated sites.

Thus we decided to take advantage of the solvent sites of paddlewheel units to crosslink polyhedral cage molecules into a network.

This way, the integrated system can achieve simultaneous carbon capture and energy storage objectives, in the scenario of a wastewater treatment plant application. In this study, such technology was developed in a medium-scale prototype (32 L volume), which was operated for 400 days in different conditions of temperature, voltage and CO2 capture rate. The prototype achieved the highest CH4 production rate (147 \u00b1 33 L m\u20133 d\u20131) at the lowest specific energy consumption (1.0 \u00b1 0.3 kWh m\u20133 CH4) when operated at 25\u00b0C and applying a voltage of 0.7 V, while capturing and converting 22 L m\u20133 d\u20131 of CO2. The produced biogas was nearer to biomethane quality (CH4 > 90% v/v) when CO2 was not injected in the wastewater. Traces of hydrogen (H2) in the biogas, detectable during the periods of closed electrical circuit operation, indicated that hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis was taking place at the cathode. On the other hand, a relevant CH4 production during the periods of open electrical circuit operation confirmed the presence of acetoclastic methanogenic microorganisms in the microbial community, which was dominated by the archaeal genus Methanothrix (Euryarchaeota). Different operational taxonomic units belonging to the bacterial Synergistes phylum were found at the anode and the cathode, having a potential role in organic matter degradation and H2 production, respectively. In the panorama of methanation technologies currently available for power-to-gas, the performances of this bioelectrochemical prototype are not yet competitive, especially in terms of volumetric CH4 production rate and power density demand. However, the possibility to obtain a high-quality biogas (almost reaching biomethane quality standards) at a minimal energy consumption represents a potentially favorable business scenario for this technology.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "7f140da0829b45da4d88952c892c1deb3c1e776e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2076505169", "DOI": "10.1016/J.EGYPRO.2009.02.297", "CorpusId": 110636241}, "title": "Improving the global carbon capture and storage educational capacity", "abstract": null, "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "1ab106d5e579ea3e4a02fcac5d3746feb12a3008", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2987790838", "DOI": "10.2118/1119-0024-jpt", "CorpusId": 209794801}, "title": "Industry Continues to Make Progress on Carbon Capture", "abstract": "Does the world really want carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS)? The answer is an unequivocal \u201cYes,\u201d say the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the United Nations, and many oil and gas companies, among others. The consensus is that rapid scaleup of CCUS is essential for meeting climate and emissions targets while not crippling economic growth. As much as 450 million Mt of CO2 could be captured, used, and stored globally with a commercial incentive as low as $40/Mt, according to the IEA. Yet this potential remains largely untapped.\n \u201cIt\u2019s a chicken-and-egg problem,\u201d said Dan Cole, vice president of commercial development and governmental relations at Denbury Resources. \u201cTo address the challenges, more projects need to be built, but more aren\u2019t being built,\u201d said\u2022Cole. \u2022\n The reasons are many. The engineering sector is trying to scale up relatively immature technologies outside of niche projects and experiencing growing pains. Uncertainty around policy and return on investment (ROI), or lack thereof, is pushing back or halting large-scale projects. Public sentiment is pushing ever harder against carbon of any type in favor of renewable energy.\n CCUS encompasses four interrelated areas, each of which face its own distinct technological, financial, and perceptual challenges.\n Capture\n Transportation\n Storage\n Use/Reuse\n Fig. 1 illustrates the CCUS process.\n Carbon Capture\u2014the Least Mature Area\n Approximately two-thirds of the total cost of CCUS is attributed to carbon capture. Additionally, capturing and compressing CO2 is estimated to increase the cost per watt-hour of energy produced by 21\u201391% for fossil fuel power plants, and applying the technology to existing plants would be more expensive, especially if they are far from a sequestration site.\n Of all the components of the CCUS process, capture is considered the least technologically mature. Belief is widespread that optimizing a CO2 capture process would significantly increase the feasibility of CCUS because transport and storage technologies are more\u2022mature.\n Capturing CO2 is most effective at point sources such as large fossil fuel or biomass energy facilities, industries with major CO2 emissions, natural gas processing, synthetic fuel plants, and fossil fuel-based hydrogen production plants.\n CO2 also can be captured directly from the air through direct air capture (DAC) rather than at a point source. Carbon dioxide can be separated out of air or flue gas with absorption, adsorption, or membrane gas separation technologies. Absorption, or carbon scrubbing, with amines is currently the dominant capture technology.

A central challenge here can be found in the utilization of low-cost low-carbon electricity that will be intermittently available for the production of hydrogen. Methanol is a high volume platform chemical of universal use in chemical industry as well as applicable for fueling internal combustion engines. As such, it provides a promising pathway for the large scale re-use of CO2 to decarbonize the transportation and chemical sectors in Europe and decrease the dependence on fossil fuel imports. Production of methanol from CO2 offers the unique combination of scale, efficiency and economic value necessary to achieve large-scale carbon reduction targets. Currently, a first demonstration plant is being operated by CRI in Iceland using CO2 originating from geothermal sources (REF), and a pilot is being constructed in Germany on the basis of CO2 coming from a coal fired power plant (METHCO2). In this context, the FReSMe project will demonstrate the production of Methanol (MeOH) using as CO2 from blast furnace gases (BFG) in the iron and steel industry.

In the present Part 1 of a two-part paper, we formulate and study a simple Coupled Climate\u2013Economy\u2013Biosphere (CoCEB) model. This highly idealized model constitutes the basis of our integrated assessment approach to understanding the various feedbacks involved in the system. CoCEB is composed of a physical climate module, based on Earth's energy balance, and an economy module that uses endogenous economic growth with physical and human capital accumulation. We concentrate on the interactions between the two subsystems: the effect of climate on the economy, via damage functions, and the effect of the economy on climate, via control of greenhouse gas emissions. Simple functional forms of the relation between the two subsystems permit simple interpretations of the coupled effects. The CoCEB model is used to evaluate hypotheses on the long-term effect of investment in emission abatement, and on the comparative efficacy of different approaches to abatement. In this paper, we consider investments in low-carbon technologies. Carbon capture and storage (CCS), along with deforestation reduction, will be dealt with in Part 2. The CoCEB model is highly flexible and transparent; as such, it allows one to easily formulate and compare different functional representations of climate change mitigation policies. Using different mitigation measures and their cost estimates, as found in the literature, one is able to compare these measures in a coherent way. While many studies in the climate\u2013economic literature treat abatement costs merely as an unproductive loss of income, this paper shows that mitigation costs do slow down economic growth over the next few decades, but only up to the mid-21st century or even earlier; growth reduction is compensated later on by having avoided negative impacts of climate change on the economy.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "1c2fd13b3b2f9eaf04c50113fd5fc6712f8b04e0", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.0c06017", "CorpusId": 232354645, "PubMed": "33764042"}, "title": "Energy and CO2 Emissions Penalty Ranges for Geologic Carbon Storage Brine Management.", "abstract": "Safe and cost-effective geologic carbon storage will require active CO2 reservoir management, including brine extraction to minimize subsurface pressure accumulation.

Based on these results, CCS-EOR (where CO2 is sourced from IGCC, PC and oxy-fuel plants) provides one potential means for producing electricity and oil to meet growing energy demand and reducing CO2 emissions to abate global warming.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "b356c8c698b30d2c1998bce1b678695c6e924320", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1765913149", "CorpusId": 94083049}, "title": "LAYERED DOUBLE HYDROXIDES FOR CO2 CAPTURE", "abstract": "Atmospheric concentrations of several greenhouse gases, in particular, carbon dioxide (CO2) have increased significantly in the recent past largely due to the combustion of fossil fuels. The capture of CO2 from industrial flue gases has therefore become a vital issue attracting the attention of several research groups and organisations in the world. One of the important options to control CO2 emissions is carbon dioxide sequestration that is, capturing and securely storing CO2 emitted from major sources of emission. There are several existing options available for CO2 capture however, each of these systems has its own limitations that impede the technical or economical viability in CO2 post combustion capture systems. Selective adsorption mechanism is a promising technique considered for CO2 separation. A few inorganic materials (zeolites and activated carbons) were found to have good adsorption capacities of CO2. However, they are not attractive for separation from wet feeds at high temperatures due to poor hydrothermal stability. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are novel inorganic compounds, and in particular their layered double oxide (LDO) derivatives produced on calcination have desired properties as CO2 adsorbents in post-combustion capture applications. LDHs were prepared by the co-precipitation of divalent Mg and trivalent Al ions in an alkaline solution containing NaOH/Na2CO3. Samples were characterised before and after calcination using various techniques such as FTIR, XRD, TGA and XPS. Different LDH samples prepared were screened to identify the samples with optimum sorption properties. CO2 sorption was measured both volumetrically and thermogravimetrically as a function of calcination and sorption temperatures. Reversible sorption (desorption) capacities were determined using vacuum and temperature cycling methods. A thorough investigation of aspects pertaining to aging, regeneration, impact of water and sorption potentials of the remaining flue gas components including SOx and NOx was conducted during this research. The findings and discussions from this work provide following major contributions to the CO2 capture research. \u0095 Significant increase in the CO2 sorption capacity of LDOs by using novel synthesis procedure; \u0095 Recyclability with good sorption/desorption potential and more than 90% regenerabilty of LDOs; \u0095 Mechanistic aspects of CO2 sorption identified based on heats of adsorption and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) data; \u0095 Good hydrothermal stability and SOx sorption capacity with potential for high temperature CO2 separation application from flue gas; \u0095 High sorption values and consistent performance even at low CO2 partial pressures of flue gas. The first contribution of this work is related to the synthesis of LDOs leading to best CO2 sorption capacity (1.20 mmol/g). Using novel synthesis procedure an increase of 100% in the sorption capacity was achieved over the sorption capacity of conventionally prepared LDOs. This was possible by choosing optimum reactant concentrations and conditions from the large number of LDH samples prepared and tested. In this study Mg/Al ratio of 3 and CO3 2- concentration of 0.33M were found to be the optimum values leading to high sorption capacity. Further, rate of addition of metal ions and aging of the reaction mixture were also found to produce LDOs with better surface properties including higher surface area. Calcination of LDH at appropriate temperature leading to LDO formation was another important aspect that influenced sorption capacity. Calcination temperature of 400 oC was found ideal for the LDHs prepared with above concentrations. Excellent regenerability and stability of the material after repeated vacuum and temperature cycles with good sorption/desorption potential refers to the second contribution of this work. Sample MAC2 exhibited up to 88% reversibility (desorption) of the total sorption on vacuum evacuation while MAC5 sample which showed maximum sorption (1.20 mmol/g) released up to 58%. However, temperature cycling produced over 70% reversibility with all the samples. High consistency observed in the sorption/desorption patterns after six cycles demonstrated the stability and recyclability of this material. In all the cases more than 90% of the original sorption capacity was recovered after regeneration. Aging or storage of LDOs in the atmosphere found to produce significant structural changes leading to more than 25% reduction in the sorption capacities. An in-situ calcination method was found to be highly productive and suggested for all sorption measurements of LDO to over come these losses. The third contribution of this work relates to identifying the type of sorption and mechanism. Isosteric heat of sorption (71.46 kJ/mol) calculated from the sorption isotherms suggests that it is mostly a chemisorption process. Increase of sorption values with temperature up to 200 oC also proves that the sorption process involves activation energy. TPD results also revealed that only a small amount (7.82%) of total sorption is a weak adsorption. Hence, it is concluded that CO2 sorption on LDO is mostly a chemisorption process rather than physisorption. Finally CO2 sorption on LDO is explained with a suitable mechanism in correlation with TPD results. The fourth contribution is provided by demonstrated hydrothermal stability and superior SOx sorption potential of LDOs. Unlike with other solid sorbents such as zeolites, presence of water in the feed proved to have no adverse impact on CO2 sorption efficiency of LDOs. Water was found to adsorb on LDO simultaneously along with CO2 by increasing the sorption value up to 76% over the maximum dry CO2 sorption value observed at 200 oC. Similar behaviour observed at 300 and 400 oC proved the hydrothermal stability of LDO. The water uptake of the LDOs which was found to be approximately equal to the difference of wet and dry CO2 sorptions proved that water did not restrict CO2 sorption. Consistent sorption/desorption behaviour observed after six temperature cycles also revealed the hydrothermal stability of the sorbent. LDOs found to have very high sorption potential of SOx. Even at low feed concentrations of SOx (0.1% in N2) the sorption values were very high (6.65%) indicating strong affinity of SOx for LDO. SOx sorption was observed to be much stronger as regenerartion levels are less than 50%. All the other constituents of flue gas including NOx showed no sorption property towards LDO. Final contribution resulted from the testing of sorption performance under flue gas concentrations. For the first time LDOs were tested using mixed gas containing 14% CO2 in wet and dry conditions. LDO demonstrated excellent sorption/desorption behaviour with the sorption values equivalent to 70% of the single gas measurements even though CO2 concentration decreased by seven times. The performance in the presence of water was similar to that observed in the case of single gas. Temperature cycling between 200- 300 oC found to be highly effective with 70% reversibility both in dry and wet conditions. Preferential sorption of SOx over CO2 was observed to influence CO2 sorption capacity. Future research should be aimed at further improvement of the CO2 sorption capacities of LDOs by introducing alkali or alkali earth metal oxide promoters. Vacuum temperature swing adsorption (VTSA) method will be considered to achieve high sorption reversibility. Membrane synthesis using LDOs will be another interesting aspect to consider.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "59a85df395edca14e7f032af02415700b11cf11f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2889033908", "DOI": "10.1115/GT2018-75901", "CorpusId": 139675988}, "title": "Performance Improvement of a Micro Gas Turbine Adopting Exhaust Gas Recirculation for CO2 Capture by Integration With Liquid Air Energy Storage", "abstract": "Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) can be applied to a micro gas turbine (MGT) for the efficient removal of CO2 using post-combustion capture. The EGR increases the CO2 concentration of the exhaust gas for the capture process, which augments the capture rate. However, the performance penalty of the MGTs caused by the rise in the compressor inlet temperature due to the EGR is a drawback. In this research, we investigated the integration of an MGT, adopting EGR with liquid air energy storage (LAES), an emerging energy storage technology. LAES stores electric energy from renewables or the power grid in the form of cryogenic liquid air. The liquefied air is pressurized and regasified to generate electricity during peak demand hours. In our proposed system, a portion of the cryogenic air is injected into the MGT\u2019s compressor inlet. The purpose of the injection is twofold. Firstly, it decreases the compressor inlet air temperature, which enhances the MGT performance, especially the power output. Secondly, it increases the carbon dioxide composition of the exhaust gas, which enhances the carbon capture performance. An MGT system, equipped with a post-combustion capture and integrated with the cryogenic air injection, was analyzed. The analysis shows that the system power, system efficiency, and CO2 capture rate were improved, with the heat duty of the carbon capture process reduced in accordance with the increase in cryogenic flow rate, as expected. Moreover, the heat duty of the carbon capture process decreased significantly due to the increase in temperature and O2 concentration in the cryogenic air.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "38c90140eb1f0308493852350588fad9533678c8", "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "1801.06259", "MAG": "2963059848", "DOI": "10.1557/ADV.2018.190", "CorpusId": 103684785}, "title": "Schwarzites for Natural Gas Storage: A Grand-Canonical Monte Carlo Study", "abstract": "The 3D porous carbon-based structures called Schwarzites have been recently a subject of renewed interest due to the possibility of being synthesized in the near future.

However, much like the \"Energy Roadmap 2050\" adopted by the Commission in December 2011, the Green Paper is based on assumed scenarios that are, to a great extent, no longer relevant. The European Commission needs to provide updated model calculations immediately to enable energy policy decisions to be taken on the basis of transparent and comprehensible scenarios. A comparison of recent estimates conducted by DIW Berlin indicates that the Commission systematically underestimates the cost of nuclear power and carbon capture, transport, and storage, while the cost of renewable energies tends to be overestimated. This applies in particular to photovoltaics where capital costs are, to a certain extent, already lower than the Commission's estimates for 2050. In contrast to renewable energies, neither nuclear energy nor carbon capture, transport, and storage are cost efficient enough to play a central role in the future European electricity mix. It is therefore vital for Europe to continue to focus on the further development of renewable energies in future. This requires the setting of ambitious renewables targets for 2030 as well as clear emissions reduction and energy efficiency targets.

As an example some new power plants in Germany managed to reduce the CO2 emissions by 40%, moving to another fuel with less carbon content, or to biofuels which is a renewable source, through CCS Carbon Capture and Storage of CO2. The Carbon Capture Transportation and Sequestration (CCTS) solution appears to be one of the most promising technologies under investigation in several Joint Industrial Projects sponsored by Energy Companies. The optimal set up of all this technology has to be found very timely. Energy penalties associated to each part of it (Capture, Transport and Underground Storage) should be carefully evaluated to launch promptly pilot projects with the aim to get know how and accumulate experience from \u201cthe in field exercise\u201d; at the same time all the aspects related to safety and reliability of CCTS chain are of paramount importance for the industrial deployment of the technology in \u201cfull scale\u201d applications. The European Union Renewable Energy Directive and European Commission (2012), have in fact drawn the road map to cope with a 20% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020. As a matter of fact, in the latest years a lot of studies and funds have been devoted to reduce the energy penalty for the CO2 capture at concentrated emitters as well as to evaluate the most proper monitoring systems for the storage sites, but no effort has been done to fill the gap in the transportation.

Pipelines can efficiently transport supercritical \u201cpure\u201d CO2 (coming from natural reservoirs and largely used in North America for the Enhanced Oil Recovery since the late 70s), nonetheless some specific issues have to be investigated due to the nature of transported fluid, particularly when it comes from industrial plants and is richer in a large variety of impurities compared to \u201cnatural carbon dioxide\u201d. In particular the major challenges for these infrastructures can be summarized in the following key issues: engineering design of pipelines from the long term integrity point of view, adoption of proper codes/standards, public acceptance on safety issues.

Hydrothermal experiments are performed to evaluate geochemical and mineralogic effects of injecting SO 2 - CO 2 fluid into a carbonate reservoir. The experimental design is based on a natural carbon dioxide reservoir, the Madison Limestone on the Moxa Arch of Southwest Wyoming, which serves as a natural analog for geologic cosequestration of sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide.

This model has the objective of \nfinding cost-efficient investment strategies within the electricity supply system until \nmid-century (2050). Special emphasis is put on the transition from the present system \nto a system which meets stringent CO2 reduction targets, considering timing of new \ninvestments and technology choices. Thus, the existing capital stock (power plants) \nis included in the model through application of a detailed database, the Chalmers \nenergy infrastructure database, providing information (e.g. fuel type, capacity and \nage structure) on present and planned power plants down to block level for European \npower plants. Assuming technical lifetimes for power plants in the database gives \nresidual capacities remaining over the period studied, which together with new \ninvestments meet projected electricity demand. New investment options are limited \nto presently known technologies and aggregated into technology classes (e.g. hard \ncoal condensing power and onshore wind power). European analyses include \nassessments of fully integrated markets for electricity, CO2 emission allowances and \na joint European effort to meet the targets for renewables. \nThe results indicate that technology options at hand and efficiency measures can help \nto reduce CO2 emissions from European electricity supply substantially. The studies \npresented here assume emission reductions within the electricity sector of up to 85% \nby 2050, compared to 1990 emission levels. To meet these goals, however, \nsignificant changes are required in the current infrastructures of the electricity-supply \nsystem.

In addition, it can be seen that efficiency measures to reduce electricity \ndemand are of great importance to reduce the strain in capacity ramp-up of CCS and \nrenewables. Common targets on CO2 emission reductions point to differentiated \nstrategy between member states.

Air\u2013oxy dual mode means that the combustion system operates either in the conventional air-fired mode or in the oxy-fired mode to give operational flexibility as a CO2-capture-ready plant. It is expected that the plant will demonstrate CCS capability for the designated period (lifetime of the project), but continuous operation would only be allowed if the economics of the situation are favorable. This paper describes the considerations of the air-separation process for the O2-supply and CO2-purification processes of a conceptual oxy\u2013coal combustion system for 100 MWe power generation and proposes feasible process diagrams of an ASU and CPU. Furthermore, the proposed designs are evaluated by the major performance parameters, such as power consumption for air separation and CO2 purification, and techniques for the optional integration of the ASU, boiler, and CPU into an integrated CO2 capture and storage facility are discussed. Oxy\u2013coal combustion is one of the most promising approaches for carbon capture and storage associated with large-scale coal-fired power stations. This paper presents the results of a study on air-separation and CO2-purification processes in terms of a conceptual design for an oxy\u2013coal combustion system for 100 MWe (electrical) power generation. Feasible processes and design considerations for air separation and CO2 purification are proposed that take into account the operational stability of the overall plant before its demonstration. Air separation by using a double column, which has two main air compressors, to produce 95 % purity gaseous O2 is proposed. Two possible cases for cryogenic separation according to the phase of the captured CO2 are considered.

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is believed to be a major technology to considerably reduce CO2 emissions (Budinis et al., 2018). Applying this technology, the anthropogenic CO2 could be injected into depleted reservoirs and permanently stored in the subsurface. However, standalone CCS projects may not be economically feasible due to CO2 separation, transportation and storage costs (Pires et al., 2011). On the other hand, one of the most efficient Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) methods is carbon dioxide injection (Holm, 1959). Therefore, a combination of CO2-EOR and storage schemes could offer an opportunity to produce additional oil from depleted reservoirs and permanently store CO2 in the subsurface in an economically efficient manner.\n In this study, a depleted sandstone reservoir located in the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS) is used. An innovative development scenario is considered, involving two phases: CO2 storage phase at the beginning of the project followed by a CO2-EOR phase. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the effect of different injection methods, including continuous gas injection (CGI), continuous water injection (CWI), Water Alternating Gas (WAG), Tapered WAG (TWAG), Simultaneous Water Above Gas Co-injection (SWGCO), Simultaneous Water and Gas Injection (SWGI) and cyclic SWGI on oil recovery and CO2 storage potential in the depleted reservoir.\n A conceptual 2D high-resolution heterogeneous model with one pair injector-producer is used to investigate the mechanisms taking place in the reservoir during different injection methods. This knowledge is applied in a field scale, realistic 3D compositional reservoir model of a depleted sandstone reservoir in the NCS including ten oil producers and twenty water/gas injectors.\n The simulation results demonstrate that innovative development scenario is viable to improve oil recovery and storage capacity in the depleted reservoirs. Different injection scenarios are benchmarked, and cyclic SWGI method is found to be the most efficient scenario in enhancing oil recovery and employing the highest capacity for CO2 storage.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "dc4b3018bed58eccfae906819f415310b2393581", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.17268/sci.agropecu.2018.04.04", "CorpusId": 239414509}, "title": "Influence of three agroforestry systems of cocoa cultivation on carbon capture and storage", "abstract": "In order to develop economically and environmentally sustainable productive activities, the effect of three agroforestry systems (SAF) of the cocoa crop was evaluated.

We develop new tools, techniques, and concepts to advance systems and technology analysis. Based on a process systems engineering approach, we apply mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to develop least-cost optimisation models of a national-scale power system in different temporal and complexity variations. The Electricity Systems Optimisation models integrate detailed power plant operation and long-term systems planning to overcome limitations of existing models for technology and system design. We present implementation strategies to include endogenous technology learning and myopic versus perfect foresight planning considering disruptive events. This is enabled through data processing and MILP reformulation techniques developed and applied in this work. We further introduce a new technology valuation metric, the System Value (SV), which quantifies the reduction in total system cost caused upon the deployment of a power generation or storage technology. Unlike purely costbased metrics, the SV enables a fair comparison of different power technologies taking the whole-system impacts of deployment into account. We find that the SV of a given technology is a function of its penetration level and initial configuration of the system. In a future United Kingdom setting, grid-level energy storage provides the greatest value under a premise of decarbonisation and maintaining security of supply. Additionally, dispatchable and flexible low-carbon power generation, such as Carbon Capture and Storage equipped power plants prove particularly valuable in being able to accommodate higher levels of intermittent renewable power generation and providing ancillary services. On a systems level, we find that including endogenous technology learning in power systems planning emphasises the economic advantage of early investments in low-carbon technology. Myopic power systems planning can lead to sub-optimal capacity expansion.

In this paper, a novel multi-energy systems optimisation model was proposed to maximise investment and operating synergy in the electricity, heating, and transport sectors, considering the integration of a hydrogen system to minimise the overall costs. The model considers two hydrogen production processes: (i) gas-to-gas (G2G) with carbon capture and storage (CCS), and (ii) power-to-gas (P2G). The proposed model was applied in a future Great Britain (GB) system. Through a comparison with the system without hydrogen, the results showed that the G2G process could reduce \u00a33.9 bn/year, and that the P2G process could bring \u00a32.1 bn/year in cost-savings under a 30 Mt carbon target. The results also demonstrate the system implications of the two hydrogen production processes on the investment and operation of other energy sectors. The G2G process can reduce the total power generation capacity from 71 GW to 53 GW, and the P2G process can promote the integration of wind power from 83 GW to 130 GW under a 30 Mt carbon target.

Advocates will reiterate that all of the individual components exist at scale and operate safely in a variety of environments, but it is difficult to engage in a serious public debate over risks or to develop an effective risk communications strategy if there is no actual project on which to present information. So why has CCS remained the imaginary low-carbon technology? There have been a series of false starts that has frustrated advocates and convinced some critics that CCS is a \u2018red herring\u2019 (Khimm 2008) or \u2018smoke screen\u2019 (Greenpeace 2008). After publication of the IPCC Special Report on CCS in 2005, there was significant policy attention to the technology, leading to numerous public pronouncements on CCS, most all of which turned out to be vastly optimistic. In 2007, the European Council called for a demonstration programme of up to 12 large-scale CCS projects to be operational by 2015. A key element of this ambition was using emissions allowances from the \u2018New Entrant Reserve\u2019 to fund CCS projects (what became known as NER300). That funding later expanded to include \u2018innovative\u2019 renewables, and by the time of the award of NER300 projects under the first call, not a single CCS project was funded, whereas 15 renewables projects were selected, ranging from concentrated solar power to wave power.

They are as follows: selecting an appropriate process analyzer, integration between the analyzer and the process, model development to enable the analyzer to predict a process-related chemical or physical attribute, use of the developed model in real-time application and use of the data obtained from the analyzer as an input to a process control unit. Partial least square regression model is a useful chemometric-based method to extract hidden chemical information in measurements from a process analyzer.

Unfortunately, the implementation of carbon reduction projects is minor compared to the existing opportunities. For projects to be implemented, it is very important to establish their economic feasibility. Given the different access to renewable energy, utilization, and storage options, CO2 emissions reduction would exhibit very different economics depending on the location.

In oxy-fuel combustion, oxygen diluted with recycled flue gas oxidizes the fuel. The elimination of air-borne nitrogen generates a flue gas that mainly consists of carbon dioxide and water. The carbon dioxide is compressed and separated from impurities to generate a stream suitable for storage. The emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which is the topic of this thesis, is important in the construction of all power plants. In oxy-fuel power plants, NOx may require consideration in the gas entering the flue gas treatment, in the gas ventilated to the atmosphere, and in the storage gas. \nThe combustion conditions of importance to nitrogen chemistry differ between the state of air and oxy-fuel operation due to the low concentration of air-borne nitrogen and the recycling of flue gases. This work investigates two combustion strategies for controlling the emission of NOx from oxy-fuel combustion: 1) reburning and 2) what we call \u201chigh-temperature reduction\u201d. Reburning reactions rapidly reduce NOx, which is recycled back to the flame zone. Reburning is promoted by sub-stoichiometric combustion and by controlling combustion temperatures. The high-temperature reduction is made feasible by the low concentration of nitrogen in oxy-fuel combustion, which may reverse the Zeldovich mechanism (responsible for thermal NOx formation) to reduce the NOx formed from fuel-bound nitrogen. To achieve this result, a combustion strategy with low air-ingress, sub-stoichiometric conditions and high inlet oxygen concentration is required. In contrast with the strategy for reburning reduction, the combustion strategy for high-temperature reduction is not conventional, but benefits from reduced flue gas flow and efficient combustion. \nAn oxy-fuel power plant also offers expanded opportunities for controlling NOx in the flue-gas treatment, which are reviewed in the present work. For example, the elevated pressure increases the formation of NO2, which may be absorbed in water. To find the optimal organisation of NOx control in oxy-fuel power plants, further work is required to define the limits of NOx, experimentally validate the proposed measures, and then evaluate the corresponding cost. It is of importance not to mimic the air-combustion in the development of oxy-fuel combustion, but rather utilize the broadened combustion conditions to arrive at the optimal performance with respect to emissions, combustion efficiency and investment.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "7543ca1de9b11d2b0a67c4aae66781bad3adc27e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "20746582", "CorpusId": 150997376}, "title": "How to close the gap between global energy demand and renewable energy production", "abstract": "One of the main challenges in the years to come is to minimize the climatic changes resulting from global warming.

The benefits for considering and using unmineable coalbeds for a system concept of CO2-CH4 cycle include the following: (1) CO2 is captured from power plant flue gas, pressurized, and transported to injection wells completed in deep unmineable coals; (2) Coals near existing power plants have enormous capacity to store CO2 while enhancing CH4 production; (3) Coal reserves underlie many U.S. power plants with as many as 90% unmineable; and (4) Injection of CO2 into unmineable gassy coals allows for displacement of one molecule of sorbed CH4 while two or more molecules of CO2 are sequestered on the coal surface.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "1394a728f94dc1c214abb38c9f97dd5f4341252a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2979856139", "DBLP": "conf/ccece/AsgharianA19", "DOI": "10.1109/CCECE.2019.8861750", "CorpusId": 204231342}, "title": "Co-Optimization of Generation Capacity Planning and Carbon Capture and Storage Using Benders Decomposition", "abstract": "Increasing climate concerns are forcing governments to establish tighter decarbonization policies.

The existing models conducting to the emergence of biochemistry from geochemistry on Earth are introduced. The chapter is focused on abiotic photosynthesis as a way to capture energy and generate the core of central metabolism. Universality in intermediate metabolism, mineral catalysis, hydrothermal vents, and the iron-sulfur proposals are discussed. Special emphasis is given to the model of non-enzymatic prebiotic metabolism that can potentially connect the RNA world and the compartmentalization in protocells approach. Catalysis in mineral surfaces is suggested as the main mechanism for the possible origin of the central metabolic pathways. Candidate semiconductor minerals such as zinc sulfide could have driven this prebiotic chemistry in the young planet. A shallow-water hydrothermal vent system is presented as a model environment where the first microorganisms on Earth used the suggested non-enzymatic chemical reactions as a pioneer mechanism for carbon dioxide fixation and energy storage that resulted in prebiotic metabolism.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "b6d25c954429d1ac65190819fabcdf7fd2638eb9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2137482449", "DOI": "10.1002/cbic.201100332", "CorpusId": 22104319, "PubMed": "21751327"}, "title": "Synthesis, Kinetic Evaluation and Cell\u2010Based Analysis of C\u2010Alkylated Isofagomines as Chaperones of \u03b2\u2010Glucocerebrosidase", "abstract": "There is an increasing interest in identifying small molecules that act as pharmacological chaperones (PC) for the treatment of lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs), such as Gaucher disease (GD), because they represent a potentially less expensive, orally available class of therapeutic for the treatment of LSD patients with both visceral and neurological involvement. Of the more than fifty LSD, GD occurs at the highest frequency (1 in 40 000\u201350 000, general population). Although enzyme replacement therapy is an effective treatment for the type I non-neuronopathic form of GD, it is expensive and is not effective in patients with neurological symptoms, for example, type 2/3 GD patients bearing alleles other than the common p.N370S. A number of different classes of noncarbohydrate and carbohydrate-based compounds, including polyhydroxylated bicyclic isoureas, aminocyclitols, iminoxylitols, isofagomine (IFG), 8] N-substituted d-lactams, sp iminosugars, bicyclic nojirimycin and deoxynojirimycin derivatives have been reported that act as b-glucocerebrosidase (GCase) inhibitors and potential pharmacological chaperones, enhancing enzyme activity in cell-based assays on patient fibroblasts. Virtually all of these compounds are competitive inhibitors of GCase, and while inhibitory potency serves as a good first approximation of pharmacological chaperoning efficacy, it is not the sole determinant (Table 1, Wang et al.). The bioavailability, metabolic half-life and intracellular distribution of the compounds are also expected to affect the degree of enzyme activity enhancement. Indeed potent inhibitors are not necessarily the best chaperones, since the inhibitor must be diluted and/or displaced within the lysosome in order for the enzyme to function. In animal studies, constant partitioning of the compound into the bladder will help achieve this goal, but no such removal occurs in cell-based assays, leading to possible underestimation of the enhancement effect. Khanna et al. tackled this issue by first capturing intracellular mutant GCase on concanavalin A (ConA)-conjugated Sepharose beads, which enabled washout of residual amounts of inhibitor present in the lysate prior to evaluation of GCase activity. We follow-up on that approach in the present report on the synthesis and evaluation of C-alkylated isofagomines as chaperones. The class of compounds exhibiting the strongest inhibition towards GCase, which have also been shown to enhance enzyme activity in GD patient fibroblasts bearing the p.N370S mutation, are the C-6 alkylated IFG derivatives first reported by Zhu et al. Herein we report the synthesis, kinetic evaluation and measurement of glucocerebrosidase chaperoning efficacy for several new compounds within this class in an effort to delineate the features that are most important for chaperoning. We show that fine tuning of the C-6 alkylation has effects on inhibitory potency that correlate with the trend previously established wherein a chain of four or more carbons is needed to impart tighter binding than the parent IFG. Interestingly, further addition of an axial alkyl chain to position 6 does not affect binding relative to compounds bearing only an equatorial chain of the same length. We also found that addition of a terminal hydroxyl group improves binding, perhaps due to adventitious hydrogen bonding interactions. There has been ambiguity as to the type of inhibition exhibited by the most potent known inhibitor of GCase to date, C-6 nonyl IFG. Here we provide conclusive kinetic evidence that it is indeed a competitive inhibitor of GCase. As the alkyl chain was tuned, it [a] T. Hill, Dr. S. G.
