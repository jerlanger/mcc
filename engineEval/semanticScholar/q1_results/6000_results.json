Empirical soot models widely adopted in engine simulations have not been adequately validated to predict soot formation with multiple injections. In this work, a multiple-step phenomenological (MSP) soot model that includes particle inception, surface growth, oxidation, and particle coagulation was revised to better describe the physical processes of soot formation in diesel combustion. It was found that the revised MSP model successfully reproduces measured soot emission dependence on the start-of-injection timing, while the two-step empirical and the original MSP soot models were less accurate. The revised MSP model also predicted reasonable soot and intermediate species spatial profiles within the combustion chamber. In addition, the revised MSP model provides information about the soot particle number density, soot precursor radical, and acetylene growth species concentration during diesel combustion.

The environmental performance of algal biofuel production can vary considerably and is influenced by engineering, biological, siting, and land-use considerations.

However attempts to commit countries to reduce their emissions though the ratification of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol have been hampered by disagreement about the extent to which land carbon sinks should be considered in meeting these reduction commitments. The report highlights the considerable uncertainty in the scientific understanding of the causes, magnitude and permanence of the land carbon sink. While noting that the potential for human enhancement of the land carbon sink through changes in land management practices is finite in size and duration, it recommends that methods used in the production of forest and agricultural crops should be modified to reflect their short-term role in absorbing carbon dioxide. Reform of the European Unions Common Agricultural Policy could provide one opportunity to achieve this on agricultural land in Europe. With respect to the inclusion of land carbon sinks in the Kyoto Protocol, the report expresses concern that measurement techniques currently available are not sufficiently accurate to permit the reliable monitoring of any land carbon sinks that may be designated as part of such international agreements.

Implementing programs to reduce emissions from tropical forest loss in Southeast Asia are perceived to be expensive due to high opportunity costs of avoided deforestation. However, these costs are not representative of all REDD+ opportunities as they are typically based on average costs across large land areas and are primarily for reducing deforestation from oil palm or pulp concessions. As mitigation costs and carbon benefits can vary according to site characteristics, spatially-explicit information should be used to assess cost-effectiveness and to guide the allocation of scarce REDD+ resources. We analyzed the cost-effectiveness of the following REDD+ strategies in Indonesia, one of the world's largest sources of carbon emissions from deforestation: halting additional deforestation in protected areas, timber and oil palm concessions, reforesting degraded land and employing reduced-impact logging techniques in logging concessions. We discover that when spatial variation in costs and benefits is considered, low-cost options emerged even for the two most expensive strategies: protecting forests from conversion to oil palm and timber plantations. To achieve a low emissions reduction target of 25%, we suggest funding should target deforestation in protected areas, and oil palm and timber concessions to maximize emissions reductions at the lowest cumulative cost. Low-cost opportunities for reducing emissions from oil palm are where concessions have been granted on deep peat deposits or unproductive land. To achieve a high emissions reduction target of 75%, funding is allocated across all strategies, emphasizing that no single strategy can reduce emissions cost-effectively across all of Indonesia. These findings demonstrate that by using a spatially-targeted approach to identify high priority locations for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, REDD+ resources can be allocated cost-effectively across Indonesia.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "7511d8acfc9f0afef874f287b29cc013f288f19e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2892198794", "DOI": "10.1021/ACS.EST.6B00177", "CorpusId": 20747473, "PubMed": "27676468"}, "title": "Personal Vehicles Evaluated against Climate Change Mitigation Targets.", "abstract": "Meeting global climate change mitigation goals will likely require that transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions begin to decline within the next two decades and then continue to fall.

Here, we examine the costs and carbon intensities of 125 light-duty vehicle models on the U.S. market today and evaluate these models against U.S. emission-reduction targets for 2030, 2040, and 2050 that are compatible with the goal of limiting mean global temperature rise to 2 \u00b0C above preindustrial levels.

A hybrid life-cycle analysis was completed to assess the potential for anaerobic biodegradation of MSW to methane, a valuable energy source. Conversion of MSW to methane in AD would generate a form of renewable energy, reduce GHG emissions, and save landfill space for nonbiodegradable materials. Based on laboratory- and pilot-scale studies conducted in the United States, full-scale data from facilities in Europe, and economic input-output life-cycle analysis, the annual 127 million t of MSW landfilled in the United States could be biologically converted to 5.9 billion m 3 of methane. Net methane production would have an estimated value of $1.5 billion/year when converted to an equivalent amount of electricity at an assumed value of $0.1/kWh. The 15 billion kWh/year of renewable energy released through the biodegradation process is estimated to satisfy the annual consumption of 1.3 million United States households. The analysis also suggests that diversion of MSW from landfills to AD systems would result in GHG emissions reductions of 146 million t CO 2 e per year, due to decreased landfill activity and use of biogenic methane instead of fossil fuel for electricity production. This represents a reduction in total emissions of 1.9% compared to U.S. GHG emissions in 2006. Nationwide AD systems are projected to reduce cumulative energy consumption by nearly 15 million TJ and reduce GHG emissions by 7.2 billion t CO 2 e, over a 50-year period. Logistics and capital costs of developing a nationwide reactor-based system for MSW management are considerable. Development of appropriate national policy and incentives would be needed to stimulate such a transition from the current landfill-based system that currently exists. It is estimated that a carbon emissions credit on the order of $30 to $60/t CO 2 e would facilitate break-even economics for nationwide implementation of AD systems. Alternatively, renewable energy credits would enhance the value of electricity produced from AD biogas.

This paper explores the land and water implications of increased biofuel production globally and with special focus on these two important countries, using the WATERSIM model. It concludes that, although of lesser concern at the global level, local and regional impact could be substantial. In fact, the strain on water resources would be such in China and India that it is unlikely that policy makers will pursue biofuel options, at least those based on traditional field crops.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "7f2dc3b955fe5b3e58be8ff2e9faa7808592cc15", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1996476764", "DOI": "10.1007/BF00542429", "CorpusId": 95122707}, "title": "Mercury in the Swedish environment \u2014 Recent research on causes, consequences and corrective methods", "abstract": "ABSTRACTDuring the last decade a new pattern of Hg pollution has been discerned, mostly in Scandinavia and North America. Fish from low productive lakes, even in remote areas, have been found to have a high Hg content. This pollution problem cannot be connected to single Hg discharges but is due to more widespread air pollution and long-range transport of pollutants. A large number of waters are affected and the problem is of a regional character. The national limits for Hg in fish are exceeded in a large number of lakes. In Sweden alone, it has been estimated that the total number of lakes exceeding the blacklisting limit of 1 mg Hg kg-1 in 1-kg pike is about 10 000.The content of Hg in fish has markedly increased in a large part of Sweden, exceeding the estimate background level by about a factor of 2 to 6. Only in the northernmost part of the country is the content in fish close to natural values. There is, however, a large variation of Hg content in fish within the same region, which is basically due to natural conditions such as the geological and hydrological properties of the drainage area. Higher concentrations in fish are mostly found in smaller lakes and in waters with a higher content of humic matter.Since only a small percentage of the total flow of Hg through a lake basin is transferred into the biological system, the bioavailability and the accumulation pattern of Hg in the food web is of importance for the Hg concentrations in top predators like pike. Especially, the transfer of Hg to low trophic levels seems to be a very important factor in determining the concentration in the food web. The fluxes of biomass through the fish community appear to be dominated by fluxes in the pelagic food web. The Hg in the lake water is therefore probably more important as a secondary source of Hg in pike than is the sediment via the benthic food chain.Different remedy actions to reduce Hg in fish have been tested. Improvements have been obtained by measures designed to reduce the transport of Hg to the lakes from the catchment area, eg. wetland liming and drainage area liming, to reduce the Hg flow via the pelagic nutrient chains, eg. intensive fishing, and to reduce the biologically available proportion of the total lake dose of Hg, eg. lake liming with different types of lime and additions of selenium. The length of time necessary before the remedy gives result is a central question, due to the long half-time of Hg in pike.In general it has been possible to reduce the Hg content in perch by 20 to 30% two years after treatments like lake liming, wetland liming, drainage area liming and intensive fishing. Selenium treatment is also effective, but before this method can be recommended, dosing problems and questions concerning the effects of selenium on other species must be evaluated. Regardless how essential these kind of remedial measures may be in a short-term perspective, the only satisfactory long-term alternative is to minimize the Hg contamination in air, soil and water.Internationally, the major sources of Hg emissions to the atmosphere are chlor-alkali factories, waste incineration plants, coal and peat combustion units and metal smelter industries. In the combustion processes without flue gas cleaning systems, probably about 20 to 60% of the Hg is emitted in divalent forms.In Sweden, large amounts of Hg were emitted to the atmosphere during the 50s and 60s, mainly from chlor-alkali plants and from metal production. In those years, the discharges from point sources were about 20 to 30 t yr 1. Since the end of the 60s, the emission of Hg has been reduced dramatically due to better emission control legislation, improved technology, and reduction of polluting industrial production. At present, the annual emissions of Hg to air are about 3.5 t from point sources in Sweden.In air, more than 95% of Hg is present as the elemental Hg form, HgO0. The remaining non-elemental (oxidized) form is partly associated to particles with a high wash-out ratio, and therefore more easily deposited to soils and surface waters by precipitation.The total Hg concentration in air is normally in the range 1 to 4 ng m-3. In oceanic regions in the southern hemisphere, the concentration is generally about 1 ng m\u22123, while the corresponding figure for the northern hemisphere is about 2 ng m-3. In remote continental regions, the concentrations are mainly about 2 to 4 ng m\u22123.In precipitation, Hg concentrations are generally found in the range 1 to 100 ng L\u22121. In the Nordic countries, yearly mean values in rural areas are about 20 to 40 ng L\u22121 in the southern and central parts, and about 10 ng L\u22121 in the northern part. Accordingly, wet deposition is about 20 (10 to 35) g km\u22122 yr\u22121 in southern Scandinavia and 5 (2 to 7) in the northern part. Calculations of Hg deposition based on forest moss mapping techniques give similar values.The general pattern of atmospheric deposition of Hg with decreasing values from the southwest part of the country towards the north, strongly suggests that the deposition over Sweden is dominated by sources in other European countries. This conclusion is supported by analyses of air parcel back trajectories and findings of significant covariations between Hg and other long range transported pollutants in the precipitation. Apart from the long range transport of anthropogenic Hg, the deposition over Sweden may also be affected by an oxidation of elemental Hg in the atmosphere.Atmospheric Hg deposited on podzolic soils, the most common type of forest soil in Sweden, is effectively bound in the humus-rich upper parts of the forest soil. In the Tiveden area in southern Sweden, about 75 to 80% of the yearly deposition is retained in the humus layer, chemically bound to S or Se atoms in the humic structure. The amount of Hg found in the B horizon of the soils is probably only slightly influenced by anthropogenic emissions. In the deeper layers of the soil, hardly any accumulation of Hg takes place. The dominating horizontal flow in the soils takes place in the uppermost soil layers (0 to 20 cm) during periods of high precipitation and high groun water level in the soils. The yearly transport of Hg within the soils has been calculated to be about 5 to 6 g km\u22122.The specific transport of total Hg from the soil system to running waters and lakes in Sweden is about 1 to 6 g km\u22122 yr1. The transport of Hg is closely related to the transport of humic matter in the water. The main factors influencing the Hg content and the transport of Hg in run-off waters from soils are therefore the Hg content in soils, the transport of humic matter from the soils and the humus content of the water. Other factors, for example acidification of soils and waters, are of secondary importance. Large peatlands and major lake basins in the catchment area reduce the out-transport of Hg from such areas. About 25 to 75% of the total load of Hg of lakes in southern and central Sweden originates from run-off from the catchment area. In lakes where the total load is high, the transport from run-off is the dominating pathway.The total Hg concentrations in soil solution are usually in the range 1 to 50, in ground water 0.5 to 15 and in run-off and lake water 2 to 12 ng L\u22121, respectively. The variation is largely due to differences in the humus content of the waters. In deep ground water with a low content of humic substances, the Hg concentration is usually below 1 ng L\u22121.The present amount and concentrations of Hg in the mor layer of forest soils are affected by the total anthropogenic emissions of Hg to the atmosphere, mainly during this century. Especially in the southern part of Sweden and in the central part along the Bothnian coast, the concentrations in the mor layer are markedly high. In southern areas the anthropogenic part of the total Hg content is about 70 to 90%. Here, the increased content in these soils is mainly caused by long-range transport and emissions from other European countries, while high level areas in the central parts are markedly affected by local historical emissions, mainly from the chlor-alkali industry.When comparing the input/output fluxes to watersheds it is evident that the present atmospheric deposition is much higher than the output via run-off waters, on average about 3 to 10 times higher, with the highest ration in the southern parts of Sweden. Obviously, Hg is accumulating in forest soils in Sweden at the present atmospheric deposition rate and, accordingly, the concentrations in forest soils are still increasing despite the fact that the emissions of Hg have drastically been reduced in Sweden during the last decades. The increased content of Hg in forest soils may have an effect on the organisms and the biological processes in the soils. Hg is by far the most toxic metal to microorganisms. In some regions in Sweden, the content of Hg in soils is already today at a level that has been proposed as a critical concentration.To obtain a general decrease in the Hg content in fish and in forest soils, the atmospheric deposition of Hg has to be reduced. The critical atmospheric load of Hg can be defined as the load where the input to the forest soils is less than the output and, consequently, where the Hg content in the top soil layers and the transport of Hg to the surface waters start to decrease. A reduction by about 80% of the present atmospheric wet deposition has to be obtained to reach the critical load for Scandinavia.", "year": 1991}, {"paperId": "2fc51cad871d18ecbfafc2c44822d4100a1dad73", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3126295804", "DOI": "10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2021.126305", "CorpusId": 233905472}, "title": "Emission reduction decision of agricultural supply chain considering carbon tax and investment cooperation", "abstract": null, "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "e7e379cd68855018a60ad5ba0d32f484e0497515", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2042967366", "DOI": "10.1093/MNRAS/279.3.915", "CorpusId": 3446437}, "title": "Optical, infrared and millimetre-wave properties of Vega-like systems", "abstract": "Photometric observations at optical and near-infrared wavelengths are presented for members of a new sample of candidate Vega-like systems, or main sequence stars with excess infrared emission due to circumstellar dust. The observations are combined with IRAS fluxes to define the spectral energy distributions of the sources. Most of the sources show only photospheric emission at near-IR wavelengths, indicating a lack of hot (,1000 K) dust. Mid-infrared spectra are presented for four sources from the sample. One of them, HD 150193, shows strong silicate emission, while another, HD 176363, was not detected. The spectra of two stars from our previous sample of Vega-like sources both show UIR-band emission, attributed to hydrocarbon materials. Detailed comparisons of the optical and IRAS positions suggest that in some cases the IRAS source is not physically associated with the visible star. Alternative associations are suggested for several of these sources. Fractional excess luminosities are derived from the observed spectral energy distributions. The values found are comparable to those measured previously for other Vega-like sources. Key words: circumstellar matter \u00b1 planetary systems \u00b1 infrared: stars. 1 I N T R O D U C T I O N Vega-excess, or Vega-like systems are main sequence stars that exhibit infrared emission above expected photospheric levels. The best known Vega-excess stars are a Lyr itself and b Pic. The excess flux is ascribed to thermal emission from circumstellar dust grains orbiting in a disc or ring structure (see e.g. Aumann et al. 1984). Imaging of the dust emission at infrared and submillimetre wavelengths (e.g. Holland et al. 1998; Koerner et al. 1998) and coronagraphic imaging of scattered light (e.g. Smith & Terrile 1984; Schneider et al. 1999) have confirmed that the dust is indeed distributed in discs. Many searches of the IRAS catalogues have found other candidate Vega-like stars (e.g. Aumann 1985; Sadakane & Nishida 1986; Walker & Wolstencroft 1988; Stencel & Backman 1991). The Infrared Space Obsevatory (ISO) has also been used to search for new Vega-likes. One notable result was the discovery of dust emission from r Cnc (Dominik et al. 1998), a G8V star which is known to host at least one planet (Butler et al. 1997). Comprehensive reviews of the Vega-excess phenomenon and its relation to the formation of planets can be found in Backman & Paresce (1993), Ferlet & Vidal-Madjar (1994) and Lagrange, Backman & Artymowicz (2000). 1.1 The new catalogue Mannings & Barlow (1998; henceforth MB) have recently published the results of a new search for candidate Vega-like systems. The search made use of the IRAS Faint Source Survey Catalogue (FSC; see Moshir et al. 1992 for details). The FSC has a sensitivity limit approximately one magnitude fainter than the Point Source Catalog (PSC), achieved by co-adding the individual detector data before extracting sources. The increased sensitivity is gained at the expense of a slight reduction in the reliability of the detections (94 per cent, compared with 99.997 per cent for the PSC). The FSC was searched for main-sequence stars by extracting sources that were positionally associated with luminosity class V stars from the published volumes of the Michigan Catalog of TwoDimensional Spectral Types for the HD Stars (Houk & Cowley 1975; Houk 1978; Houk 1982; Houk & Smith-Moore 1988). Volumes 1\u00b14 of the Michigan catalogue give spectral types and luminosity classes for some 130397 HD stars south of a declination d \u0088 2128. Cross-correlating these catalogues gave a total of 294 luminosity class V stars that have good detections in the IRAS bands 1\u00b1 3, 1 and 2, or 2 and 3 (bands 1, 2, 3 and 4 have wavelengths of 12, 25, 60 and 100mm respectively). Of these, 131 stars were found to show significant IR excess emission. See MB for details of the selection process. q 2000 RAS w E-mail: rjs@star.ucl.ac.uk 74 R. Sylvester and V. Mannings MB searched for excess IR emission on the basis of ratios of the IRAS fluxes, reasoning that a fall-off of flux with wavelength that was shallower than that expected from a stellar photosphere implies excess emission. They therefore did not need to determine the expected (i.e. photospheric) fluxes in the IRAS bands. While this approach provides a robust method for identifying sources with excess emission, detailed analysis of the emitting material requires knowledge of the photospheric contribution to the IR fluxes. We have therefore made optical and near-IR photometric observations of a number of the MB sources, in order to characterize their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at wavelengths where thermal dust emission will be negligible, which allows the photospheric contribution to the SED to be calculated for all wavelengths (typically by using a model atmosphere) and to find the wavelength at which the onset of excess emission occurs. The latter is important for deriving the total excess luminosity, and the maximum temperature of the emitting dust. 2 O B S E RVAT I O N S 26 stars from the MB sample were selected for observing on the basis of their RA and such photometry as was available in the literature. These target stars are listed in Table 1. All the new photometric observations presented here were made in 1995 September, using the facilities of the South African Astronomical Observatory. Spectra in the 10mm band were obtained at UKIRT in 1996 September and 1998 July. 2.1 Optical photometry Photometry was obtained in both the broad-band UBV(RI)C system and in the intermediate-band Stro\u00c8mgren uvby system. Both sets of observations were made using the Modular Photometer on the 0.5-m reflector at the SAAO Sutherland site. See Kilkenny et al. (1998) and Kilkenny & Laing (1992) for details of the use of this instrument, the adopted standard star systems and the data reduction procedures for UBV(RI)C and uvby photometry respectively. An aperture of 25 arcsec was used, and sky background measurements were made for each star that was observed. The data were reduced by SAAO staff, using the photometric reduction procedures described in the latter two references. 2.2 Near-infrared photometry Near-IR (JHKL) observations were made with the MkII Infrared Photometer at the Cassegrain focus of the 0.75-m reflector at Sutherland. The MkII photometer uses an InSb detector cooled by pumped liquid nitrogen, and is of similar design to the MkI instrument described by Glass (1973). Background subtraction is achieved using a sector-wheel chopper in the instrument, with a chopping frequency of 12.5 Hz. The photometer integration time was 10 seconds at a single pointing. The telescope was nodded in declination every 20 s to allow for gradients in the sky emission. An observing `module' consists of two nodded pairs of integrations (on-off-off-on), and therefore lasts 40 seconds. For each target, sufficient modules were taken to attain an adequate signalto-noise ratio in the co-added result. 2.3 Hipparcos/Tycho photometry As well as a wealth of parallax and astrometric data, the Hipparcos mission (ESA 1997) produced a great deal of useful photometric data, for the pre-selected stars in the Hipparcos Input Catalogue, and also for more than a million stars brighter than V , 11:5 (forming the Tycho Catalogue). Stars in the Hipparcos catalogue have photometry in the B, V and I bands, derived from satellite and selected ground-based measurements, while the Tycho catalogue gives B and V magnitudes. Data from the Hipparcos and Tycho catalogues were used to supplement the new ground-based photometry and to check our results. 2.4 Mid-IR spectroscopy Mid-IR spectra were taken on 1998 July 1 of four sources from the MB catalogue: HD 109085, 123356, 150193 and 176363. The data were obtained at UKIRT, using the common-user helium-cooled spectrometer CGS3 in its low-resolution \u0085R < 55\u0086 10mm mode. A detailed description of CGS3 can be found in Cohen & Davies (1995). The spectra were flux calibrated by dividing the spectrum of the target by that of a standard star, then multiplying by a model of the mid-IR spectrum of the standard. a Boo was used to calibrate the HD 109085 spectrum; the model for this standard was the absolutely-calibrated spectrum of Cohen et al. (1995). HD 123356 and HD 150193 were calibrated using s Lib, assumed to radiate as a 3640 K blackbody with a 10.0-mm flux of 188.6 Jy, while HD 176363 was calibrated using h Sgr, treated as a 3600 K blackbody with a 10.0-mm flux of 208.7 Jy. Many of the stars in the MB list are too far south to be observed from UKIRT, so we have not attempted a comprehensive CGS3 survey. Similarly, we do not have SAAO photometry for two of the stars observed with CGS3 due to the different constraints on the two observing runs. The four MB stars observed with CGS3 were selected on criteria including their declination, IRAS 12-mm flux and compatibility with the scheduling of other targets on the observing night. q 2000 RAS, MNRAS 313, 73\u00b186 Table 1.

However, it has seldom been used in light-duty diesel engines. Therefore, this paper focuses on an investigation into the thermal efficiency and pollution emission analysis of a light-duty diesel engine generator fueled with different water content emulsified diesel fuels (WD, including WD-0, WD-5, WD-10, and WD-15). In this study, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and carbon dioxide were analyzed by a vehicle emission gas analyzer, and the particle size and number concentration were measured by an electrical low-pressure impactor. In addition, engine loading and fuel consumption were also measured to calculate the thermal efficiency. Measurement results suggested that water-emulsified diesel was useful to improve the thermal efficiency and the exhaust emission of a diesel engine. Obviously, the thermal efficiency was increased about 1.2 to 19.9%. In addition, water-emulsified diesel leads to a significant reduction of nitric oxide emission (less by about 18.3 to 45.4%). However, the particle number concentration emission might be increased if the loading of the generator becomes lower than or equal to 1800 W. In addition, exhaust particle size distributions were shifted toward larger particles at high loading. The consequence of this research proposed that the water-emulsified diesel was useful to improve the engine performance and some of exhaust emissions, especially the NO emission reduction. Implications: The accumulated test results provide a good basis to resolve the corresponding pollutants emitted from a light-duty diesel engine generator. By measuring and analyzing transforms of exhaust pollutant from this engine generator, the effects of water-emulsified diesel fuel and loading on emission characteristics might be more clear. Understanding reduction of pollutant emissions during the use of water-emulsified diesel helps improve the effectiveness of the testing program.

Due to the role of these modelling sources of uncertainty, the adoption of strict rules for estimation and reporting would favour comparability of emission reductions between countries.

Public access to datasets and methodology used to evaluate reference level and emission reductions would strengthen the credibility of the system by promoting accountability and transparency.

First, private consumption and its associated production are among the key drivers of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, especially among highly emitting industrialized economies. There is no evidence that decoupling of the economy from GHG emissions is possible at the scale and speed needed.

The results show a moderate autonomous growth of emissions by 5% in the period 2000 to 2020, if it is assumed that no new technology is introduced and demand (measured in physical units) increases 1% per year, on average. However, if it is assumed that ongoing technology development succeeds, emissions in 2020 may decrease by 5% from 2000 levels (a decrease of 10% compared to the case that assumes no new technology). This is a significant contribution to emission reduction. According to this model, a further emission reduction by 10% in 2020 is possible but costly as it requires emission reduction incentives of up to 10,000 yen per ton CO2 (approximately 100 US/ton).

CCS is envisioned to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions to the atmosphere when applied to large facilities that use fossil fuels. Applied to biomass, it may also lower CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere while supplying energy. The publication of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (2005) Special Report on CCS (SRCCS) raised the profile of CCS, particularly among the expert community dealing with international climate policy (Meadowcroft and Langhelle 2009). The expert community now commonly sees CCS as a major option for reducing global emissions of CO2. The technology plays a major role in long-term scenarios where there is significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (Clarke et al. 2009; IEA 2010a). For CCS to play such a major role, the separation, transport and storage would have to handle large volumes of CO2, and involve huge investments in facilities and infrastructure. The SRCCS conveyed some key insights. First, it clearly indicated that in principle, CCS is technically feasible. It also found that subsurface endowments of geological storage are probably massive, but regionally distributed and still highly uncertain.

As a large country with great disparities in economic development and industrial structure among its regions, it is essential to understand the carbon emission characteristics of regions and industrial sectors in order to formulate effective and targeted policies to achieve domestic carbon emission reduction targets. For this reason, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis in this article of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions structure and major responsible sectors for 19 provincial regions of mainland China. Great disparities in direct CO2 emissions and intensities are identified across regions. We show that the direct CO2 intensities in regions are affected by not only the economic development level, but also by the structure of the carbon\u2010intensive sectors and sectoral CO2 emissions intensities. A region\u2010by\u2010region fine\u2010scale breakdown analysis demonstrates that both the direct CO2 emissions and total CO2 emissions are highly concentrated in a minority of sectors: the construction sector is the major contributor to the total CO2 emissions in all regions, followed by the services sectors as a whole.

Nitrogen oxides (NOx) have fallen steadily across the US over the last 15 years. At the same time, NOx concentrations decrease on weekends relative to weekdays, largely without co-occurring changes in other gas-phase emissions, due to patterns of diesel truck activities. These trends taken together provide two independent constraints on the role of NOx in the nonlinear chemistry of atmospheric oxidation. In this context, we interpret interannual trends in wintertime ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) in the San Joaquin Valley of California, a location with the worst aerosol pollution in the US and where a large portion of aerosol mass is NH4NO3. Here, we show that NOx reductions have simultaneously decreased nighttime and increased daytime NH4NO3 production over the last decade. We find a substantial decrease in NH4NO3 since 2000 and conclude that this decrease is due to reduced nitrate radical-initiated production at night in residual layers that are decoupled from fresh emissions at the surface. Further reductions in NOx are imminent in California, and nationwide, and we make a quantitative prediction of the response of NH4NO3. We show that the combination of rapid chemical production and efficient NH4NO3 loss via deposition of gas-phase nitric acid implies that high aerosol days in cities in the San Joaquin Valley air basin are responsive to local changes in NOx within those individual cities. Our calculations indicate that large decreases in NOx in the future will not only lower wintertime NH4NO3 concentrations but also cause a transition in the dominant NH4NO3 source from nighttime to daytime chemistry.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "9a0080c133fe6c2a3e237f4f66f46752f4a6fa01", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2055638978", "DOI": "10.1159/000345987", "CorpusId": 31128160, "PubMed": "23445555"}, "title": "Neuroimaging Markers of Motor and Nonmotor Features of Parkinson's Disease: An [18F]Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Computed Tomography Study", "abstract": "Aim: We sought to identify markers of motor and nonmotor function in Parkinson's disease (PD) using advanced neuroimaging techniques in subjects with PD.

Large\u2010scale deployment of other climate mitigation strategies is also necessary. Among these, increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks is an important lever because carbon in soils can be stored for long periods and land management options to achieve this already exist and have been widely tested. However, agricultural soils are also an important source of nitrous oxide (N2O), a powerful greenhouse gas, and increasing SOC may influence N2O emissions, likely causing an increase in many cases, thus tending to offset the climate change benefit from increased SOC storage. Here we review the main agricultural management options for increasing SOC stocks. We evaluate the amount of SOC that can be stored as well as resulting changes in N2O emissions to better estimate the climate benefits of these management options. Based on quantitative data obtained from published meta\u2010analyses and from our current level of understanding, we conclude that the climate mitigation induced by increased SOC storage is generally overestimated if associated N2O emissions are not considered but, with the exception of reduced tillage, is never fully offset.

The truss system enables an increased aspect ratio with lower sweep, thickness ratio, and chords, thus exploiting natural laminar flow. The design problem is solved by an MDO process, which takes into account both aerodynamic and structural considerations. The paper contains several studies, each of which investigates the dependency of the design space on a specific aerodynamic parameter such as the extent of laminar flow on the wing, cruise Mach number, maximum cruise twodimensional lift coefficient, the supercritical characteristics of the airfoil, winglet influence, and intersection fairing design. In addition, various fuselage drag reduction technologies are investigated: fuselage relaminarization, surface riblets, tailless arrangements and Goldschmied apparatus. All of these studies illustrate large potential of the truss-braced wing along with additional drag reduction technologies, which may substantially decrease the fuel weight and vehicle emissions. The paper emphasizes the importance of appropriate wing section airfoils, which can satisfy various contradicting criteria of natural laminar flow, supercritical characteristics, high lift coefficient, and low drag coefficient.

Exhaust emissions from fossil diesel fuelled engines are known to cause adverse effects on human health, but there is very limited information available on how the new renewable fuels may change the harmfulness of the emissions, especially particles (PM). We evaluated the PM emissions from a heavy-duty EURO IV diesel engine powered by three different fuels; the toxicological properties of the emitted PM were investigated. Conventional diesel fuel (EN590) and two biodiesels were used\u2009\u2212\u2009rapeseed methyl ester (RME, EN14214) and hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) either as such or as 30% blends with EN590. EN590 and 100% HVO were also operated with or without an oxidative catalyst (DOC\u2009+\u2009POC). A bus powered by compressed natural gas (CNG) was included for comparison with the liquid fuels. However, the results from CNG powered bus cannot be directly compared to the other situations in this study.ResultsHigh volume PM samples were collected on PTFE filters from a constant volume dilution tunnel. The PM mass emission with HVO was smaller and with RME larger than that with EN590, but both biofuels produced lower PAH contents in emission PM. The DOC\u2009+\u2009POC catalyst greatly reduced the PM emission and PAH content in PM with both HVO and EN590. Dose-dependent TNF\u03b1 and MIP-2 responses to all PM samples were mostly at the low or moderate level after 24-hour exposure in a mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7. Emission PM from situations with the smallest mass emissions (HVO\u2009+\u2009cat and CNG) displayed the strongest potency in MIP-2 production. The catalyst slightly decreased the PM-induced TNF\u03b1 responses and somewhat increased the MIP-2 responses with HVO fuel. Emission PM with EN590 and with 30% HVO blended in EN590 induced the strongest genotoxic responses, which were significantly greater than those with EN590\u2009+\u2009cat or 100% HVO. The emission PM sample from the CNG bus possessed the weakest genotoxic potency but had the strongest oxidative potency of all the fuel and catalyst combinations. The use of 100% HVO fuel had slightly weaker and 100% RME somewhat stronger emission PM induced ROS production, when compared to EN590.ConclusionsThe harmfulness of the exhaust emissions from vehicle engines cannot be determined merely on basis of the emitted PM mass. The study conditions and the engine type significantly affect the toxicity of the emitted particles. The selected fuels and DOC\u2009+\u2009POC catalyst affected the PM emission from the heavy EURO IV engine both qualitative and quantitative ways, which influenced their toxicological characteristics. The plain HVO fuel performed very well in emission reduction and in lowering the overall toxicity of emitted PM, but the 30% blend of HVO in EN590 was no better in this respect than the plain EN590. The HVO with a DOC\u2009+\u2009POC catalyst in the EURO IV engine, performed best with regard to changes in exhaust emissions. However some of the toxicological parameters were significantly increased even with these low emissions.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "fb48b9472bcaec07107de16945c52cef24062e1b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2040363629", "DOI": "10.1243/14680874JER02008", "CorpusId": 55220086}, "title": "Combustion in a heavy-duty direct-injection engine using hydrogen\u2014methane blend fuels", "abstract": "Abstract Adding hydrogen to the fuel in a direct injection natural gas engine offers the potential significantly to reduce local and global air pollutant emissions.

This paper considers the current feasibility of using an ecosystem services approach to appraise the benefits of alternative scenarios for controlling agricultural ammonia emissions in the UK. The effect of ammonia emission reductions on ecosystem service delivery was assessed using an impact pathway approach. A \u2018weakest link\u2019 analysis identified that economic valuation of impacts on many key ecosystem services was constrained by inadequate dose\u2013response relationships to predict physical changes in service flows and/or by an inability to produce economic valuations of the predicted physical changes. For effects on biodiversity, both the timescale of response and poorly defined relationships between changes in species composition and ecosystem service delivery are significant barriers. However, it was possible to produce indicative values for the marginal impact of ammonia abatement measures on climate regulation; the values obtained were comparable in magnitude to those for human health impacts. The ecosystem service approach thus offers the potential to provide a holistic appraisal of the effects of emission reductions, and could therefore make a valuable contribution to future air quality management. However, improvements in data collection and quantification methods are needed before a full ecosystem services\u2010based evaluation of costs and benefits becomes possible for ammonia and for other major air pollutants.

The HiTAC technology has evolved from the conception of excess enthalpy combustion (EEC) to high and ultra-high preheated air combustion. In the HiTAC method, combined heat regeneration and low oxygen methods are utilized to enlarge and control the flame thermal behavior. This technology has shown promise for much wider applications in various process and power industries, energy conversion, and waste to clean fuel conversion. For each application the flow, thermal, and chemical behavior of HiTAC flames must be carefully tailored to satisfy the specific needs. Qualitative and quantitative results are presented on several gas-air diffusion flames using high-temperature combustion air.'A specially designed regenerative combustion test furnace facility, built by Nippon Furnace Kogyo, Japan, was used to preheat the combustion air to elevated temperatures. The flames with highly preheated combustion air were significantly more stable and homogeneous (both temporally and spatially) as compared to the flames with room-temperature combustion air. The global flame features showed the flame color to change from yellow to blue to bluish-green to green over the range of conditions examined. In some cases hybrid and purple color flame was also observed. Under certain conditions flameless or colorless oxidation of the fuel has also been demonstrated. Information on global flame features, flame spectral emission characteristics, spatial distribution of OH, CH, and C 2 species and emission of pollutants has been obtained. Low levels of NO x along with negligible levels of CO and HC have been obtained using high-temperature combustion air. The thermal and chemical behavior of high-temperature air combustion flames depends on fuel property, preheat temperature, and oxygen concentration of air. Waste heat from a furnace in high-temperature air combustion technology is retrieved and introduced back into the furnace using regenerator. These features help save energy, which subsequently also reduce the emission of CO 2 (greenhouse gas) to the environment. Flames with high temperature air provide significantly higher and uniform heat flux than normal air, which reduces the equipment size or increases the process material throughput for same size of the equipment. The high-temperature air combustion technology can provide significant energy savings (up to about 60%), downsizing of the equipment (about 30%), and pollution reduction (about 25%).

Exporting lignin can achieve GHG emission reductions comparable to onsite combustion in some cases, reduce life-cycle water consumption by up to 40%, and reduce combined heat and power-related capital costs by up to 63%. However, nearly 50% of current U.S. coal-fired power generating capacity is expected to be retired by 2050, which will limit the capacity for lignin cofiring and may double transportation distances between biorefineries and coal power plants.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "ec2e88c1df2bd62d5633fc40a26a16a72838a39f", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "4873495", "MAG": "2403418904", "DOI": "10.3389/fvets.2016.00039", "CorpusId": 18232816, "PubMed": "27243027"}, "title": "Recent Advances in Measurement and Dietary Mitigation of Enteric Methane Emissions in Ruminants", "abstract": "Methane (CH4) emission, which is mainly produced during normal fermentation of feeds by the rumen microorganisms, represents a major contributor to the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Several enteric CH4 mitigation technologies have been explored recently. A number of new techniques have also been developed and existing techniques have been improved in order to evaluate CH4 mitigation technologies and prepare an inventory of GHG emissions precisely. The aim of this review is to discuss different CH4 measuring and mitigation technologies, which have been recently developed. Respiration chamber technique is still considered as a gold standard technique due to its greater precision and reproducibility in CH4 measurements. With the adoption of recent recommendations for improving the technique, the SF6 method can be used with a high level of precision similar to the chamber technique. Short-term measurement techniques of CH4 measurements generally invite considerable within- and between-animal variations. Among the short-term measuring techniques, Greenfeed and methane hood systems are likely more suitable for evaluation of CH4 mitigation studies, if measurements could be obtained at different times of the day relative to the diurnal cycle of the CH4 production. Carbon dioxide and CH4 ratio, sniffer, and other short-term breath analysis techniques are more suitable for on farm screening of large number of animals to generate the data of low CH4-producing animals for genetic selection purposes. Different indirect measuring techniques are also investigated in recent years. Several new dietary CH4 mitigation technologies have been explored, but only a few of them are practical and cost-effective. Future research should be directed toward both the medium- and long-term mitigation strategies, which could be utilized on farms to accomplish substantial reductions of CH4 emissions and to profitably reduce carbon footprint of livestock production systems.

The potential of N2O emission warming the atmosphere is 290-310 times greater than CO2, and 10 times greater than CH4. The total annual N2O emissions are 0.31-0.398Mt in China, 1.19Mt in South-East Asia, and 3.6 Mt in the world. China and India are the highest producers of N2O emissions in the world. Research results showed that the N2O emissions are mainly produced from farmland by denitrification and nitrification processes.

The main result is that immediate cutbacks of methane bring a marginal benefit of between $30 and $260 per tonne, with a mean value of $110 per tonne. This compares to a benefit of between $10 and $50 per tonne of carbon, with a mean value of $20, for immediate cutbacks of carbon dioxide (all values in 1990 dollars).

This is because the surface-troposphere system typically takes decades to regain equilibrium, owing principally to the thermal inertia of the oceans. Exploring a range of alternative assumptions shows that the benefit from methane reduction is most sensitive to the discount rate.

And the higher the mixing ratio of sawdust, the more effective the reduction in NH3 emissions, however this effect was not enough to completely suppress these emissions, even at the highest mixing ratio.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "851895ac55f356a1a02e0950507d4efd8229da53", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2151973266", "DOI": "10.1093/JNCI/DJM232", "CorpusId": 37160124, "PubMed": "18042932"}, "title": "18Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer: a systematic review.", "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in industrialized countries. The overall mortality rate for lung cancer is high, and early diagnosis provides the best chance for survival. Diagnostic tests guide lung cancer management decisions, and clinicians increasingly use diagnostic imaging in an effort to improve the management of patients with lung cancer. This systematic review, an expansion of a health technology assessment conducted in 2001 by the Institute for Clinical and Evaluative Sciences, evaluates the accuracy and utility of 18fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) in the diagnosis and staging of lung cancer. Through a systematic search of the literature, we identified relevant health technology assessments, randomized trials, and meta-analyses published since the earlier review, including 12 evidence summary reports and 15 prospective studies of the diagnostic accuracy of PET. PET appears to have high sensitivity and reasonable specificity for differentiating benign from malignant lesions as small as 1 cm. PET appears superior to computed tomography imaging for mediastinal staging in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Randomized trials evaluating the utility of PET in potentially resectable NSCLC report conflicting results in terms of the relative reduction in the number of noncurative thoracotomies. PET has not been studied as extensively in patients with small-cell lung cancer, but the available data show that it has good accuracy in staging extensive- versus limited-stage disease. Although the current evidence is conflicting, PET may improve results of early-stage lung cancer by identifying patients who have evidence of metastatic disease that is beyond the scope of surgical resection and that is not evident by standard preoperative staging procedures. Further trials are necessary to establish the clinical utility of PET as part of the standard preoperative assessment of early-stage lung cancer.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "53539822314764cb880dcb2615e2c5b5b7cc4c42", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1841106173", "DOI": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.16-11-03753.1996", "CorpusId": 12971164, "PubMed": "8642418"}, "title": "Network Analysis of Positron Emission Tomography Regional Cerebral Blood Flow Data: Ensemble Inhibition during Episodic Memory Retrieval", "abstract": "Two important objectives in the neuroscience of memory are (1) identification of neural pathways involved in memory processes; and (2) characterization of the pattern of interactions between these pathways.

Relative to a baseline reading task, decreased activity was observed in bilateral prefrontal, bilateral anterior and posterior temporal, and posterior cingulate cortices. Brain regions showing increased activity were the right prefrontal (different from deactivated regions), left anterior cingulate, and left occipital cortices, and vermis of cerebellum. We then performed a network analysis with structural equation modeling to test the hypothesis that regional decreases came about through active inhibition by regions showing increased activity during retrieval. This analysis demonstrated that the influence of activated regions on deactivated regions was more negative during retrieval than during reading, confirming the inhibition hypothesis. Such confirmation could not have been made from the subtraction analysis alone because decreases can come about, at the very least, through reduction of functional influences as well as by active inhibition.

The GMM estimation results indicate that government effectiveness modifies the economic growth-emissions relationship.

In the case of countries with high government effectiveness, we observed a statistically significant reduction in CO2 emissions only in some specifications. We did not confirm the moderating role of the control of corruption in shaping the economic growth-carbon dioxide emissions nexus.

The electricity sector decarbonizes by retiring coal-fired power plants or replacing with concentrated solar power, solar photovoltaics and wind generation. Industry and tertiary-sector growth remains strong throughout the time period, with reduced energy intensity via fuel-switching and efficiency improvements.

Over the 21st century, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from freight are projected to grow faster than passenger transportation or other major end-use sectors, with the magnitude of growth dependent on the assumed extent of long-term decoupling. In climate change mitigation scenarios that apply a price to GHG emissions, mitigation of freight emissions (including the effects of demand elasticity, mode and technology shifting, and fuel substitution) is more limited than for other demand sectors. In such scenarios, shifting to less-emitting transportation modes and technologies is projected to play a relatively small role in reducing freight emissions in GCAM.

To examine the influence of both crop cultivation and surface air temperatures (SATs) on annual global isoprene and monoterpene emissions, which can lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), we simulated, on a monthly basis, the annual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the period 1854\u20132000. The model estimates were based on historical climate data such as SATs, and downward solar radiation (DSR) reproduced with an atmospheric-ocean circulation model, as well as a time series of the global distribution of cropland (to test the hypothesis that conversion of forests into croplands lowers emissions). The simulations demonstrated that global SAT, DSR, the combination of SAT and DSR, and the expansion of cropland all affected emissions. The effect of cropland expansion (i.e., forest conversion) on annual emissions during this period was larger for isoprene (~7% reduction on a global scale) than for monoterpenes (~2% reduction), mainly because of the reduction in broadleaf evergreen forests (BEFs) in Southeast Asia, which have the highest and most constant emissions of isoprene and where both temperature and radiation are high all year round. The reduction in the Amazon region and in parts of Africa, which are other primary sources of annual global isoprene emissions, but where the conversion of BEF to cropland has been much smaller than in Southeast Asia, was less remarkable, probably because the broadleaf deciduous forests and C4 grasslands in these areas have lower and seasonal emissions; hence, their conversion has less effect. On the other hand, the difference in the emission factors (e) between cropland and the other vegetation types was much lower for monoterpenes than for isoprene, although the e for cropland was generally the lowest for both compounds. Thus, the expansion of cropland also contributed to the reduction in monoterpene emissions to some degree, but had less effect. A ~5% increase in emissions due to rising SAT was more than offset by the decrease in isoprene emissions and a concurrent ~2% reduction caused by a decrease in DSR. Overall, annual global isoprene emissions in 2000 were lower than in 1854 by 13 TgC yr \u22121 , whereas annual global monoterpene emissions were higher by 2.3 TgC yr \u22121 .", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "5ee5d7108394804dc12e4f7cec849658324bec4b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2113227668", "DOI": "10.1098/rsta.2012.0186", "CorpusId": 40666130, "PubMed": "22869795"}, "title": "Geoengineering the climate: an overview and update", "abstract": "The climate change that we are experiencing now is caused by an increase in greenhouse gases due to human activities, including burning fossil fuels, agriculture and deforestation. There is now widespread belief that a global warming of greater than 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels would be dangerous and should therefore be avoided. However, despite growing concerns over climate change and numerous international attempts to agree on reductions of global CO2 emissions, these have continued to climb. This has led some commentators to suggest more radical \u2018geoengineering\u2019 alternatives to conventional mitigation by reductions in CO2 emissions. Geoengineering is deliberate intervention in the climate system to counteract man-made global warming. There are two main classes of geoengineering: direct carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management that aims to cool the planet by reflecting more sunlight back to space. The findings of the review of geoengineering carried out by the UK Royal Society in 2009 are summarized here, including the climate effects, costs, risks and research and governance needs for various approaches. The possible role of geoengineering in a portfolio of responses to climate change is discussed, and various recent initiatives to establish good governance of research activity are reviewed.

Some methods of both types would involve release of materials to the environment, either to the atmosphere or to the oceans, in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The intended impacts on climate would in any case affect many or all countries, possibly to a variable extent.
