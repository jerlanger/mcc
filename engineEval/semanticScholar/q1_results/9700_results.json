Wetland loss and climate change are known to alter regional and global methane (CH4) budgets. Over the last six decades, an extensive area of marshland has been converted to cropland on the Sanjiang Plain in northeast China, and a significant increase in air temperature has also been observed there, while the impacts on regional CH4 budgets remain uncertain. Through model simulation, we estimated the changes in CH4 emissions associated with the conversion of marshland to cropland and climate change in this area.

The cumulative reduction of CH4 from 1960 to 2009 was estimated to be ~36 Tg (24\u201357 Tg) relative to the 1950s, and marshland conversion and the climate contributed 86% and 14% of this change, respectively.

Noxious thermal stimulation was applied at the same temperature for placebo and control conditions. Placebo treatment affected endogenous opioid activity in a number of predicted \u03bc-opioid receptor-rich regions that play central roles in pain and affect, including periaqueductal gray and nearby dorsal raphe and nucleus cuneiformis, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, insula, rostral anterior cingulate, and lateral prefrontal cortex.

These findings suggest that a mechanism of placebo analgesia is the potentiation of endogenous opioid responses to noxious stimuli. Opioid activity in many of these regions was correlated with placebo effects in reported pain. Connectivity analyses on individual differences in endogenous opioid system activity revealed that placebo treatment increased functional connectivity between the periaqueductal gray and rostral anterior cingulate, as hypothesized a priori, and also increased connectivity among a number of limbic and prefrontal regions, suggesting increased functional integration of opioid responses.

To control severe air pollution in China, comprehensive pollution control strategies have been implemented throughout the country in recent years. To evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies, the influence of meteorological conditions on levels of air pollution needs to be determined. Using the intensive air pollution control strategies implemented during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum in 2014 (APEC 2014) and the 2015 China Victory Day Parade (Victory Parade 2015) as examples, we estimated the role of meteorological conditions and pollution control strategies in reducing air pollution levels in Beijing. Atmospheric particulate matter of aerodynamic diameter\u202f\u2009\u2264\u20092.5\u202f\u00b5m (PM2.5) samples were collected and gaseous pollutants (SO2, NO, NOx, and O3) were measured online at a\u00a0site in Peking University (PKU). To determine the influence of meteorological conditions on the levels of air pollution, we first compared the air pollutant concentrations during days with stable meteorological conditions. However, there were few days with stable meteorological conditions during the Victory Parade. As such, we were unable to estimate the level of emission reduction efforts during this period. Finally, a\u00a0generalized linear regression model (GLM) based only on meteorological parameters was built to predict air pollutant concentrations, which could explain more than 70\u202f% of the variation in air pollutant concentration levels, after incorporating the nonlinear relationships between certain meteorological parameters and the concentrations of air pollutants. Evaluation of the GLM performance revealed that the GLM, even based only on meteorological parameters, could be satisfactory to estimate the contribution of meteorological conditions in reducing air pollution and, hence, the contribution of control strategies in reducing air pollution. Using the GLM, we found that the meteorological conditions and pollution control strategies contributed 30 and 28\u202f% to the reduction of the PM2.5 concentration during APEC and 38 and 25\u202f% during the Victory Parade, respectively, based on the assumption that the concentrations of air pollutants are only determined by meteorological conditions and emission intensities.

These regulations appear in different forms and designs and address air and water pollution as well as climate change. The paper devotes particular attention to how various regulations have affected sustainable technological change and the prospects for inducing deep emission reductions without jeopardizing industrial competitiveness and future investments. Experiences from key pulp and paper regions, not least the Nordic countries, suggest that gradually tightening performance standards have contributed to radical reductions in emissions, e.g., chlorine compounds and biological oxygen demanding agents, and without imposing excessive compliance costs. This outcome can largely be attributed to how the regulations have been designed\u2014and implemented\u2014in practice, as well as to the presence of efficient and legitimate institutions. Long-term emission reduction targets, in combination with extended compliance periods and trustful firm-regulator relationships, contributed to radical technological innovation and permitted radical emission reductions without excessive compliance costs. The development of alternative bleaching technologies is an apt example. In contrast, the impact of carbon pricing schemes, including the EU emissions trading scheme, on carbon dioxide emissions reductions and related technological change in the pulp and paper industry has however been modest. Self-regulation, certification, and community pressure have exerted relatively modest influences on the environmental performance of the industry.

Recent studies have investigated the spatial patterns and temporal trends of nitrogen and sulfur wet deposition, but few studies have focused on dry deposition due to the scarcity of dry deposition measurements. Here, we use long-term model simulations from the coupled WRF-CMAQ model covering the period from 1990 to 2010 to study changes in spatial distribution as well as temporal trends in total (TDEP), wet (WDEP) and dry deposition (DDEP) of total inorganic nitrogen (TIN) and sulfur (TSO4). We first evaluate the model's performance in simulating WDEP over the U.S. by comparing the model results with observational data from the U.S. National Atmospheric Deposition Program. The coupled model generally underestimates the WDEP of both TIN (including both the oxidized nitrogen deposition-TNO3, and the reduced nitrogen deposition-NHX) and TSO4, with better performance in the eastern U.S. than the western U.S. TDEP of both TIN and TSO4 show significant decreases over the U.S., especially in the east due to the large emission reductions that occurred in that region. The decreasing trends of TIN TDEP are caused by decrease of TNO3, and the increasing trends of TIN deposition over the Great Plains and Tropical Wet Forests regions are caused by increases in NH3 emissions although it should be noted that these increasing trends are not significant. TIN WDEP shows decreasing trends throughout the U.S., except for the Marine West Coast Forest region. TIN DDEP shows significant decreasing trends in the region of Eastern Temperate Forests, Northern Forests, Mediterranean California and Marine West Coast Forest, and significant increasing trends in the region of Tropical Wet Forests, Great Plains and Southern Semi-arid Highlands. For the other three regions (North American Deserts, Temperate Sierras and Northwestern Forested Mountains), the decreasing or increasing trends were not significant. Both the WDEP and DDEP of TSOx have decreases across the U.S., with a larger decreasing trend in the DDEP than that in the WDEP. Across the U.S. during the 1990-2010 period, DDEP of TIN accounted for 58-65% of TDEP of TIN. TDEP of TIN over the U.S. was dominated by deposition of TNO3 during the first decade, which then shifts to reduced nitrogen (NHX) dominance after 2003 resulting from combination of NOx emission reductions and NH3 emission increases.

The emissions of non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOCs) over western Europe for the year 2005 are estimated via inverse modelling by assimilation of in situ observations of concentration and then subsequently compared to a standard emission inventory. The study focuses on 15 VOC species: five aromatics, six alkanes, two alkenes, one alkyne and one biogenic diene. The inversion relies on a validated fast adjoint of the chemical transport model used to simulate the fate and transport of these VOCs. The assimilated ground-based measurements over Europe are provided by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) network. The background emission errors and the prior observational errors are estimated by maximum-likelihood approaches. The positivity assumption on the VOC emission fluxes is pivotal for a successful inversion, and this maximum-likelihood approach consistently accounts for the positivity of the fluxes. For most species, the retrieved emissions lead to a significant reduction of the bias, which underlines the misfit between the standard inventories and the observed concentrations. The results are validated through a forecast test and a cross-validation test. An estimation of the posterior uncertainty is also provided. It is shown that the statistically consistent non-Gaussian approach based on a reliable estimation of the errors offers the best performance. The efficiency in correcting the inventory depends on the lifetime of the VOCs and the accuracy of the boundary conditions. In particular, it is shown that the use of in situ observations using a sparse monitoring network to estimate emissions of isoprene is inadequate because its short chemical lifetime significantly limits the spatial radius of influence of the monitoring data. For species with a longer lifetime (a few days), successful, albeit partial, emission corrections can reach regions hundreds of kilometres away from the stations.

Primary auditory cortex activity, as measured by the auditory steady-state response (ASSR), differed between conditions, with higher ASSRs during auditory than visual attention. Furthermore, the analysis of cortical oscillatory activity revealed increased alpha power over occipitoparietal and frontal regions during auditory compared with visual attention, putatively reflecting suppression of visual processing. In conclusion, this study showed both enhanced processing of attended acoustic stimuli in early sensory cortex and reduced processing of distracting input, both at higher cortical levels and at the most peripheral level of the hearing system, the cochlea.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "cfcb02e297df78b12341fa56b1bc7a9c205fc73b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1986483456", "DOI": "10.4236/NR.2011.21007", "CorpusId": 53958407}, "title": "A Causality Analysis of Coal Consumption and Economic Growth for China and India", "abstract": "China and India are the two countries with the strongest economic growth in the world.

In this paper Granger causality tests were used to examine the relationship between coal consumption and GDP in China and India, using data for the period from 1965 to 2006.

Accordingly, continuous efforts are required to find solutions to address the issue of excessive CO2 emission and its potential effects on climate change. It is imperative that the world looks towards a portfolio of carbon mitigation solutions, rather than a single strategy. In this regard, the use of CO2 as a C1 source is an attractive strategy as CO2 has the potential to be a great asset for the industrial sector and consumers across the globe. In particular, the reduction of CO2 offers an alternative to fossil fuels for various organic industrial feedstocks and fuels. Consequently, efficient and scalable approaches for the reduction of CO2 to products such as methane and methanol can generate value from its emissions. Accordingly, in recent years, metal-free catalysis has emerged as a sustainable approach because of the mild reaction conditions by which CO2 can be reduced to various value-added products. The metal-free catalytic reduction of CO2 offers the development of chemical processes with low cost, earth-abundant, non-toxic reagents, and low carbon-footprint.

Recently, Chinese Government announced that carbon emissions per unit of GDP would fall by 60\u201365% compared with 2005 and non-fossil fuel energy would account for 20% of primary energy consumption by 2030. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is an important regional energy consumption center in China, and its energy structure is typically coal-based which is similar to the whole country. Therefore, forecasting energy consumption related carbon emissions is of great significance to emissions reduction and upgrading of energy supply in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. Thus, this study thoroughly analyzed the main energy sources of carbon emissions including coal, petrol, natural gas, and coal power in this region. Secondly, the kernel function of the support vector machine was applied to the extreme learning machine algorithm to optimize the connection weight matrix between the original hidden layer and the output layer.

Finally, we used forecasting output of GM (Grey Prediction Theory) (1, 1) as the input of the SVM-ELM model to predict carbon emissions in the region from 2017 to 2030. The results showed that the proportion of energy consumption seriously affects the amount of carbon emissions. We found that the energy consumption of electricity and natural gas will reach 45% by 2030 and carbon emissions in the region can be controlled below 96.9 million tons.

Emission factors were based as far as possible on relevant data sourced from either the literature or databases used in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) models. The results were compared with those from a desktop simulation approach for a range of WWTP configurations that formed the basis for an LCA study of the trade-offs between nutrient removal and total environmental burden. The results from the actual operating plants compared well in general terms with those from the desktop study, although some differences in points of detail were highlighted. In either case, significant uncertainties in GHG emission estimates were apparent in respect of so-called \u201cfugitive\u201d emissions of nitrous oxide and methane from WWTP operations since both of these gases are major greenhouse contributors. Additional research will be required in this area in order to improve the accuracy of emissions reporting from the wastewater sector. Notwithstanding these uncertainties, the data suggested that imported electrical power and biosolids treatment/ disposal operations are the largest potential sources of greenhouse gas. Opportunities for significant reductions (approx. 20 to 40%) in total GHG emissions exist with the inclusion primary sedimentation, anaerobic digestion and power generation from biogas in the WWTP flow sheet. Addition of chemicals (with embodied GHG emissions) to supplement nutrient removal does not cancel out this reduction. However, from a global perspective, the LCA study has shown that GHG emissions represent only a minor (indicatively <1%) of the normalised total environmental impacts from WWTP operations. Eutrophication and potential human health or ecotoxicity impacts associated with the disposal of biosolids (particularly due to the metals content) are the dominant impacts.

The analysis demonstrates the implications of the use of different measures of cost, and explains the apparent paradox that the relative carbon price among Kyoto parties may not be an accurate measure of their relative welfare costs. Attention is given to the role of relative emissions intensity and various distortions, in the form of fuel and other taxes, in determining the burden of a climate policy. Also, effects of climate policy on welfare through an influence on the terms of trade are explored. We consider the cases of the EU, Japan, and Canada, each meeting their Kyoto targets, and the US meeting the Bush Administration\u2019s intensity target. For a country with a low emissions intensity as in Japan, the absolute reduction in tons is small relative to the macroeconomy, and this reduces its welfare loss as a share of total national welfare. Low emissions intensity (high energy efficiency) also means the economy has few options to reduce emissions still further, resulting in a higher carbon price. Energy efficiency thus pushes in both directions, lowering the number tons that need to be reduced but raising the direct cost per ton. But other factors also are important in explaining costs differences. Existing fuel taxes are very high in Japan and Europe, increasing the economic cost of a greenhouse gas emissions reduction policy. For these regions, the extra cost due to these distortions is several times the direct cost of the emissions mitigation policy itself. In contrast, fuels taxes are low in the US and relatively low in Canada. The US, EU, and Japan gain somewhat from reductions in world prices of oil and other fuels because they are net importers. Canada, in contrast, is a significant net energy exporter, and its policy costs rise considerably because of lost energy export revenue. This effect on Canada is due mostly to implementation of the policy in the other regions rather than to domestic implementation. Canada is also the most emissions intensive of these regions, a factor that contributes to its cost of control.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "5d388de418a9aead231002205947463e51615e72", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2267821048", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.2475808", "CorpusId": 131527546}, "title": "150 Years of Italian Co2 Emissions and Economic Growth", "abstract": "This paper examines the relationship between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions in Italy considering the developments in a 150-year time span.

The measures associated with the reduction of atmospheric and noise pollution has particular importance in the sector of urban buses. In many cases, they illustrate the city's environmental image and contribute to reinforcing the attractiveness of public transport. France's fleet in service, presently put at about 14,000 units, consumes about 2 per cent of the total energy of city transport. It causes about 2 per cent of the HC emissions and from 4 to 6 per cent of the NOx emissions and particles.

Several technical solutions were evaluated to quantify, on a real condition cycle for buses, on one hand pollutants emissions, fuel consumption and on the other hand reliability, cost in real existing fleet. This paper presents main preliminary results on urban buses exhaust emission on two different cases: - existing Diesel buses, with fuel modifications (Diesel with low sulphur content), Diesel with water emulsion and bio-Diesel (30% oil ester in standard Diesel fuel); renovating CNG powered Euro II buses fleet, over representative driving cycles, set up by ADEME and partners.

The analysis of the uncertainty of LCA results, and its reduction by an improved estimation of key parameters and through the improvement of the models used to convert emissions into regional impacts, such as eutrophication, are major issues for LCA. Methods In a case study of pig production systems, we propose a simple quantification of the uncertainty of LCA results (intra-system variability) and we explore the inter-system variability to produce more robust LCA outcomes. The quantification of the intra-system uncertainty takes into account the variability of the technical performance (crop yield, feed efficiency) and of emission factors (for NH3, N2O and NO3) and the influence of the functional unit (FU) (kg of pig versus hectare used). For farming systems, the inter-system variability is investigated through differentiating the production mode (conventional, quality label, organic (OA)), and the farmer practices (Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) versus Over Fertilised (OF)), while for natural systems, variability due to physical and climatic characteristics of catchments expected to modify nitrate fate is explored. Results and Conclusion For the eutrophication and climate change impact categories, the uncertainty associated with field emissions contributes more to the overall uncertainty than the uncertainty associated with emissions from livestock buildings, with crop yield and with feed efficiency. For acidification, the uncertainty of emissions from livestock buildings is the single most important contributor to the overall uncertainty. The influence of the FU on eutrophication results is very important when comparing systems with different degrees of intensification such as GAP and OA. Concerning the inter-system variability, differences in farmer practices have a larger effect on eutrophication than differences between production modes. Finally, the physical characteristics of the catchment and the climate strongly affect the results for eutrophication. In conclusion, in this case study, the main sources of uncertainty are in the estimation of emission factors, due both to the variability of environmental conditions and to lack of knowledge (emissions of N2O at the field level), but also in the model used for assessing regional impacts such as eutrophication.Recommendation and Perspective Suitable deterministic simulation models integrating the main controlling variables (environmental conditions, farmer practices, technology used) should be used to predict the emissions of a given system as well as their probabilistic distribution allowing the use of stochastic modelling. Finally, our simulations on eutrophication illustrate the necessity of integrating the fate of pollutants in models of impact assessment and highlight the important margin of improvement existing for the eutrophication impact assessment model.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "841956f7ad090073974a2bab25f6d610a0225525", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2418178044", "DOI": "10.1017/S1368980016000495", "CorpusId": 206322021, "PubMed": "26975578"}, "title": "Do low-carbon-emission diets lead to higher nutritional quality and positive health outcomes?

Soil N2O fluxes were measured from November 2010 to November 2011 from a maize (Zea mays L.)\u2010wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) sequence under various fertilizer treatments: no\u2010N control, PS applied in a single pre\u2010plant dose with or without DCD, PS split\u2010applied with or without DCD, and urea split\u2010applied.

When these mutants were propagated under light-activated heterotrophic growth conditions (in darkness except for 15 min of weak light a day) for several weeks, essentially no chlorophyll was detectable but protochlorophyllide accumulated. Upon return of the chlL- mutant cultures to continuous light, within the first 6 h chlorophyll was synthesized at the expense of protochlorophyllide at a rate independent of the presence of photosystem I. Chlorophyll biosynthesized during this time gave rise to a 685 nm fluorescence emission peak at 77 K in intact cells. This peak most likely originates from a component different from those known to be directly associated with photosystems II and I. Development of 695 and 725 nm peaks (indicative of intact photosystem II and photosystem I, respectively) required longer exposures to light. After 6 h of greening, the rate of chlorophyll synthesis slowed as protochlorophyllide was depleted. In the chlL- strain, greening occurred at the same rate at two different light intensities (5 and 50 \u03bcE m-2s-1), indicating that also at low light intensity the amount of light is not rate-limiting for protochlorophyllide reduction.

Agriculture was the main source of N input to the aquatic environment, whereas agriculture, energy generation and transport all contributed to emissions of reactive N gases to the atmosphere. Significant reductions in inputs of reactive N have been achieved during the 20 years, mainly by restricting the use of N for crop production and improving livestock feeding. This reduction has helped reduce nitrate leaching by about half. Measures to limit ammonia emissions from agriculture and mono-nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from energy generation and transport, has reduced gaseous emissions of reactive N. Much N flows through the food and feed processing industries and there is a cascade of N through the consumer to solid and liquid waste management systems.

Surface ozone is a secondary air pollutant produced during the atmospheric photochemical degradation of emitted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the presence of sunlight and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Temperature directly influences ozone production through speeding up the rates of chemical reactions and increasing the emissions of VOCs, such as isoprene, from vegetation. In this study, we used an idealised box model with different chemical mechanisms (Master Chemical Mechanism, MCMv3.2; Common Representative Intermediates, CRIv2; Model for OZone and Related Chemical Tracers, MOZART-4; Regional Acid Deposition Model, RADM2; Carbon Bond Mechanism, CB05) to examine the non-linear relationship between ozone, NOx and temperature, and we compared this to previous observational studies. Under high-NOx conditions, an increase in ozone from 20 to 40\u202f\u00b0C of up to 20\u202fppbv was due to faster reaction rates, while increased isoprene emissions added up to a further 11\u202fppbv of ozone. The largest inter-mechanism differences were obtained at high temperatures and high-NOx emissions. CB05 and RADM2 simulated more NOx-sensitive chemistry than MCMv3.2, CRIv2 and MOZART-4, which could lead to different mitigation strategies being proposed depending on the chemical mechanism. The increased oxidation rate of emitted VOC with temperature controlled the rate of Ox production; the net influence of peroxy nitrates increased net Ox production per molecule of emitted VOC oxidised. The rate of increase in ozone mixing ratios with temperature from our box model simulations was about half the rate of increase in ozone with temperature observed over central Europe or simulated by a regional chemistry transport model. Modifying the box model set-up to approximate stagnant meteorological conditions increased the rate of increase of ozone with temperature as the accumulation of oxidants enhanced ozone production through the increased production of peroxy radicals from the secondary degradation of emitted VOCs. The box model simulations approximating stagnant conditions and the maximal ozone production chemical regime reproduced the 2\u202fppbv increase in ozone per degree Celsius from the observational and regional model data over central Europe. The simulated ozone\u2013temperature relationship was more sensitive to mixing than the choice of chemical mechanism.

With this framework we analyze changes in regional livestock output, sector competitiveness and regional food consumption under different climate change mitigation policy regimes. Scenarios we have considered differ by participation/exclusion of agricultural sectors and non-Annex I countries, as well as policy instruments. The imposition of carbon tax in agriculture has adverse affects on food consumption, especially in developing countries. The reductions in food consumption are smaller if the agricultural producer subsidy is introduced to compensate for carbon tax the producers pay. The global forest carbon sequestration subsidy effectively controls emission leakage when carbon tax is imposed only in Annex I regions.

It is argued that under tight emissions constraints, some production will relocate to regions without emission constraints. The IPCC finds little evidence of carbon leakage and if it exists, it is most likely to be offset by positive spill-over effects. This finding seemingly contradicts the rapid growth in both global CO2 emissions and international trade. The underlying reason is that the IPCC only considers climate policy induced changes in emissions, while currently much of the growth in international trade and the location of production are driven by existing economic factors. In this paper, I argue for a redefinition of carbon leakage to include all emissions emitted in the production of traded products. This quantifies the separation between the environmental impacts of a countries consumption compared to production. Analysis of the emissions embodied in trade flows from 1990 to 2002 show evidence of a shift in the location of production and the products traded. There is a notable growth in China and given trends since 2002, it is likely that the separation between consumption and production has increased further. By considering the total emissions from the production of traded products, a different perspective of the role of trade in climate policy can be taken.

The WARM GHG emission factors are used to compare the net emissions associated with PCs in the following four materials management alternatives: source reduction, recycling, landfilling, and combustion. For background information on the general purpose and function of WARM emission factors, see the Introduction & Overview chapter. For more information on Source Reduction, Recycling, Landfilling, and Combustion, see the chapters devoted to those processes. WARM also allows users to calculate results in terms of energy, rather than GHGs. The energy results are calculated using the same methodology described here but with slight adjustments, as explained in the Energy Impacts chapter. The main components of a PC are the central processing units (CPU) and the monitor. The PC modeled in WARM is based on a typical desktop PC with a cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor. The CPU consists of housing (mostly steel) and internal electronic components, while the monitor's primary components are the CRT, plastic case and circuit boards. The wide range of PC models makes it difficult to specify the exact composition of a typical PC, and PC technology continues to evolve rapidly. For WARM analysis, EPA considers the CPU and CRT monitor, while the peripheral equipment (e.g., keyboards, external cables, printers) are left out of the analysis. Flat-panel monitors are now dominant in today's market, having displaced CRT monitors that were common in the 1990's and early 2000's. Although flat-panel monitors are beginning to enter the MSW stream in larger quantities, CRT monitors are still present and will likely remain a sizable component of end-of-life electronics for a number of years. Upon disposal, PCs can be recovered for recycling, sent to a landfill or combusted. Exhibit 1 shows the general outline of materials management pathways in WARM. Recycling PCs is an open-loop process, meaning that components are recycled into secondary materials such as asphalt, steel sheet, lead bullion, CRT glass, copper wire and aluminum sheet. PCs are collected curbside and at special events, or individuals can bring them to designated drop-off sites.

As a consequence, governments have strengthened regulations, imposing SO2, NOx and mercury limits in a growing number of areas, and encouraging CO2 reductions. Since the power generation industry and more specifically coal-fired power plants are responsible for a large amount of these pollutants, new combustion processes have to be developed in order to provide coal-fired power plants with a solution to comply with existing and future regulations. In this context, a new combustion process based on oxygen-enriched flue gas recirculation for pulverized coal-fired power plants is being proposed to provide an easy-to-implement option for multipollutant control, including CO2 capture. To date, theoretical analyses and lab-scale experiments have been reported, with no large-scale implementations. This paper presents the experimental results obtained from a pilot-scale demonstration of the oxygenenriched flue gas recirculation combustion process on a pulverized coal-boiler. This demonstration was performed on a 1.5MW boiler simulator, using Illinois coal. Measurements from the pilot boiler demonstrate the technical feasibility of the process for larger scale-boilers, highlighting the favorable impact on NOx, SOx and mercury emissions, while concentrating the carbon dioxide in the flue gas. The results also show a significant reduction in fly ash unburned combustible content resulting in improvement in boiler efficiency due to the use of oxygen. The paper concludes that oxygen enrichment represents a technically sound technology for multi-pollutant control. A consequent paper presented during this conference discusses the economical aspects related to the technology, indicating that oxygen enrichment is an attractive solution for ultra-clean coal-based power generation.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "73454c8ac5645fdd23b7d893ce83f92cf273ca5f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2122512329", "DOI": "10.2514/6.2007-386", "CorpusId": 110803327}, "title": "The Pratt & Whitney TALON X Low Emissions Combustor: Revolutionary Results with Evolutionary Technology", "abstract": "Pratt & Whitney has developed a family of reduced NOx combustors for aircraft gas turbine engines using the rich, quench, lean approach.

For both gasses, national and international policies have been developed with the objective of reducing the emissions. Since the early 1990s, measurements have been carried out in The Netherlands to assess the gaseous losses from manure application, especially for ammonia. Measurements of nitrous oxide emissions are relatively scarce. This paper presents the results of these measurements with the objective of providing an updated quantification of the effect of techniques for application and incorporation of manure, and to assess influencing factors. The manure application techniques differ in their spreading or placement of the manure onto the grass or soil surface or into the soil. The following techniques are treated in this paper: surface spreading, narrow-band application, shallow injection with open slots on grassland, and surface spreading, surface incorporation, deep placement on arable land. Low emission techniques such as narrow band application, shallow injection, incorporation or injection on arable land show a significant reduction of ammonia emission compared to surface spreading. On grassland, average emission factors (% of total ammonium nitrogen) were 74% for surface spreading and 16% for shallow injection. On arable land, the emission factors were 69% for surface spreading and 2% for deep placement. However, the nitrous oxide emission factor from manure applied with low ammonia emissions techniques is higher than the emission factor for surface applied manures. In a whole farm context, the higher nitrous oxide emission with shallow injection is partly offset directly by reduced emissions from fertiliser savings and indirectly from lower ammonia losses.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "eba8e159d53840da0d30f81590b2e3b01aa75731", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2115452692", "DOI": "10.1109/CITCON.2002.1006482", "CorpusId": 110731268}, "title": "Recovery of industrial heat in the cement industry by means of the ORC process", "abstract": "The 1,500 kW organic Rankine cycle heat recovery system at the Heidelberger Zement AG Plant in Lengfurt is the first of such systems supplied to the cement industry.

In cats and humans, [11C]PHNO revealed an atypical distribution compared to radiolabeled D2\u2010like antagonists (such as [11C]raclopride) or other D2\u2010like agonists (such as [11C]NPA), as it displayed unusual high binding in the globus pallidus (GP). The goal of this study was to assess the pharmacological nature of the binding of [11C]PHNO in the GP in nonhuman primates. As previously reported in humans, [11C]PHNO equilibrium specific to nonspecific equilibrium partition coefficients (V3\u2033) in baboons was much higher in GP (3.88 \u00b1 1.15) than in the dorsal striatum (DST, 2.07 \u00b1 0.43), whereas the reverse was true for [11C]raclopride (1.48 \u00b1 0.41 in GP, 2.56 \u00b1 0.91 in DST) and [11C]NPA (0.87 \u00b1 0.19 in GP, 1.02 \u00b1 0.13 in DST). Administration of unlabeled raclopride resulted in similar reductions of [11C] PHNO V3\u2033 and [11C]raclopride V3\u2033 in both the GP and the DST. This observation demonstrated that the [11C]PHNO binding in the GP was specific to D2\u2010like receptors. To evaluate the respective contribution of D3 and D2 receptors to the binding potential (BP) of [11C]PHNO and [11C]raclopride, experiments were carried out with the selective D3 partial agonist 1\u2010(4(2\u2010Napthoylamino)butyl)\u20104\u2010(2\u2010methoxyphenyl)\u20101A\u2010piperazine HCL (BP897). BP897 reduced [11C]raclopride V3\u2033 by 29% \u00b1 9%, 19% \u00b1 8%, and 10% \u00b1 7% in GP, VST, and DST, respectively, a result consistent with expectation from postmortem studies (D3/D2 ratio in GP > VST > DST). BP897 reduced [11C]PHNO V3\u2033 by 57% \u00b1 11%, 30% \u00b1 11%, and 13% \u00b1 8% in GP, VST, and DST, respectively, indicating that the D3 receptor contribution to [11C]PHNO signal is higher than that of [11C]raclopride. From these experiments we conclude that [11C]PHNO is a D3 preferring agonist, and that this property explains the high GP signal not observed with [11C]raclopride or [11C]NPA. This property might contribute to its higher vulnerability to endogenous DA compared to [11C]raclopride and [11C]NPA.

DFT (B3LYP/6-31G*) calculations supplemented the experimental results and both demonstrated that replacing oxygen with the more electron-donating aniline groups serves to only fine-tune the electronic properties because both the HOMO and LUMO energies are affected by such substitution. The electronic properties of all compounds are most greatly influenced by the nature of the substituents bound to the carbon portion of the chelate ring. Each difluoroboron complex undergoes two ligand-based, one-electron reductions where the first reduction potential becomes less favorable with increasing aniline substitution. Similarly, replacing oxygen with the more electron-donating aniline groups gives rise to slightly red-shifted absorption and emission processes. Substitution on the aniline ring has little, if any, influence on the electronic properties of the resultant complexes. (\u00a9 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Four scenarios are considered: non-cooperation, partial-cooperation delay-in-payment, supply chain carbon finance (SCCF), and full-cooperation. We discuss how firms make their pricing and carbon emission reduction decisions under different cooperative levels and financing methods. For a manufacturer-dominated supply chain, the results show that SCCF will help the small and medium enterprise seek cooperation with the monopoly manufacturer, and improve supply chain\u2019s profit compared to green loan. What\u2019s more, SCCF pattern can effectively control the total carbon emission. In addition, we extend the model to consider the retailer-dominated case. The results show that SCCF pattern can help increase the emission reduction rate of the whole supply chain.
