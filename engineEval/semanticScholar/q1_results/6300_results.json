Utilizing CO2 as the carbon feedstock to replace traditional fossil sources in commodity chemical production is a potential solution to reduce CO2 emissions. Electrochemical reduction of CO2 has attracted much attention because it not only converts CO2 into a variety of useful chemicals under mild reaction conditions, but also can be powered by renewable electricity at remote locations. From this review article, we summarize recent literature on the topic of bimetallic electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. Both selectivity and activity of bimetallic catalysts strongly depend on their compositions and surface structures. Tuning the properties of a bimetallic catalyst could result in a wide range of products, including carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, carboxylate and liquid oxygenates. By reviewing recent research efforts in the field of bimetallic electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction, we aim to provide the community with a timely overview of the\u00a0current status of bimetallic CO2 electrocatalysts and to stimulate new ideas to design better catalysts for more efficient CO2 electrolysis processes.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "b339efe0e848a14d151d4e7591f2984c3c8f06c8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2409885493", "DOI": "10.2172/1218709", "CorpusId": 113739679}, "title": "Hybrid Separations/Distillation Technology.

We combine life cycle assessments of power generation with uncertainty analysis to bound potential emissions from compensatory generation from T&D aggregate losses (that is, technical and non-technical) in 142 countries. We estimate that electricity generated due to losses from T&D infrastructure is associated with nearly 1 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year (GtCO2e\u2009yr\u20131).

Argonne National Laboratory conducted a life-cycle (i.e., well-to-wheels [WTW]) analysis of various pyrolysis pathways by expanding and employing the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model. The WTW energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the pyrolysis pathways were compared with those from the baseline petroleum gasoline and diesel pathways. Various pyrolysis pathway scenarios with a wide variety of possible hydrogen sources, liquid fuel yields, and co-product application and treatment methods were considered. At one extreme, when hydrogen is produced from natural gas and when bio-char is used for process energy needs, the pyrolysis-based liquid fuel yield is high (32% of the dry mass of biomass input). The reductions in WTW fossil energy use and GHG emissions relative to those that occur when baseline petroleum fuels are used, however, is modest, at 50% and 51%, respectively, on a per unit of fuel energy basis. At the other extreme, when hydrogen is produced internally via reforming of pyrolysis oil and when bio-char is sequestered in soil applications, the pyrolysis-based liquid fuel yield is low (15%more\u00a0\u00bb of the dry mass of biomass input), but the reductions in WTW fossil energy use and GHG emissions are large, at 79% and 96%, respectively, relative to those that occur when baseline petroleum fuels are used. The petroleum energy use in all scenarios was restricted to biomass collection and transportation activities, which resulted in a reduction in WTW petroleum energy use of 92-95% relative to that found when baseline petroleum fuels are used. Internal hydrogen production (i.e., via reforming of pyrolysis oil) significantly reduces fossil fuel use and GHG emissions because the hydrogen from fuel gas or pyrolysis oil (renewable sources) displaces that from fossil fuel natural gas and the amount of fossil natural gas used for hydrogen production is reduced; however, internal hydrogen production also reduces the potential petroleum energy savings (per unit of biomass input basis) because the fuel yield declines dramatically. Typically, a process that has a greater liquid fuel yield results in larger petroleum savings per unit of biomass input but a smaller reduction in life-cycle GHG emissions. Sequestration of the large amount of bio-char co-product (e.g., in soil applications) provides a significant carbon dioxide credit, while electricity generation from bio-char combustion provides a large energy credit. The WTW energy and GHG emissions benefits observed when a pyrolysis oil refinery was integrated with a pyrolysis reactor were small when compared with those that occur when pyrolysis oil is distributed to a distant refinery, since the activities associated with transporting the oil between the pyrolysis reactors and refineries have a smaller energy and emissions footprint than do other activities in the pyrolysis pathway.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "4b5dd8b4157d1b85968c1a9ae7830b2146915a35", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2087380376", "DOI": "10.4271/2014-01-1533", "CorpusId": 56447758}, "title": "The State of the Art in Selective Catalytic Reduction Control", "abstract": "Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) is a leading after treatment technology for the removal of nitrogen oxide (NOx) from exhaust gases (DeNOx).

The energy requirements and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions were compared to those of gasoline to explore the potential of bioethanol as sustainable fuel.MethodsThe functional unit used in the study was 10,000\u00a0MJ of energy. The data for grass seed production were collected from the farmers in Oregon and published reports. The compositions of straw, pretreatment, and hydrolysis yields were obtained from laboratory experiments. Process models were developed for ethanol production using different pretreatment technologies in SuperPro Designer to calculate the process energy, raw materials, utility use, and emissions related. The Greenhouse Gases Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation model and other literature studies were used to obtain additional data. Systematic boundary identification was performed using relative mass, energy, and economic value method using a 5% cutoff value.Results and discussionEthanol yields from grass straw were estimated 256.62, 255.8, 255.3, and 230.2\u00a0L/dry metric ton of biomass using dilute acid, dilute alkali, hot water, and steam explosion pretreatments, respectively. Fossil energy required to produce one functional unit was in the range of \u22121507 to 3940\u00a0MJ for different ethanol production techniques. GHG emissions from ethanol LCA models were in the range of \u2212131 to \u2212555.4\u00a0kg CO2 eq. per 10,000\u00a0MJ of ethanol. Fossil energy use and GHG emissions during ethanol production were found to be lowest for steam explosion pretreatment among all pretreatment processes evaluated.

The ocean is a substantial source of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere, but little is known about how this flux might change in the future. Here, we investigate the potential evolution of marine N2O emissions in the 21st century in response to anthropogenic climate change using the global ocean biogeochemical model NEMO-PISCES. Assuming nitrification as the dominant N2O formation pathway, we implemented two different parameterizations of N2O production which differ primarily under low-oxygen (O2) conditions. When forced with output from a climate model simulation run under the business-as-usual high-CO2 concentration scenario (RCP8.5), our simulations suggest a decrease of 4 to 12 % in N2O emissions from 2005 to 2100, i.e., a reduction from 4.03/3.71 to 3.54/3.56 TgN yr\u22121 depending on the parameterization. The emissions decrease strongly in the western basins of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, while they tend to increase above the oxygen minimum zones (OMZs), i.e., in the eastern tropical Pacific and in the northern Indian Ocean. The reduction in N2O emissions is caused on the one hand by weakened nitrification as a consequence of reduced primary and export production, and on the other hand by stronger vertical stratification, which reduces the transport of N2O from the ocean interior to the ocean surface. The higher emissions over the OMZ are linked to an expansion of these zones under global warming, which leads to increased N2O production, associated primarily with denitrification. While there are many uncertainties in the relative contribution and changes in the N2O production pathways, the increasing storage seems unequivocal and determines largely the decrease in N2O emissions in the future. From the perspective of a global climate system, the averaged feedback strength associated with the projected decrease in oceanic N2O emissions amounts to around \u22120.009 W m\u22122 K\u22121, which is comparable to the potential increase from terrestrial N2O sources.

For example, fewer than \ufb01fteenstudies of nitrous oxide emissions from soils have taken place in sub-SaharanAfrica, leaving the rate of emissions virtually undocumented. Due to a scarcity ofdata on GHG sources and sinks, most developing countries currently quantifyagricultural emissions and reductions using IPCC Tier 1 emissions factors.However, current Tier 1 emissions factors are either calibrated to data primarilyderived from developed countries, where agricultural production conditions aredissimilar to that in which the majority of smallholders operate, or from data thatare sparse or of mixed quality in developing countries (IPCC 2006).

At practical compression ratios, the natural gas will not auto-ignite, so a diesel pilot injection is used for ignition. Thus, the soot emissions can have contributions from the combustion of natural gas, diesel pilot, or lubricating oil.

Correlations between a suite of various monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acid concentrations are consistent with documented aqueous-phase mechanistic relationships leading up to oxalate production. Monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids exhibited contrasting spatial profiles reflecting their different sources; the former were higher in concentration near the continent due to fresh organic emissions. Concentrations of sea salt crustal tracer species, oxalate, and malonate were positively correlated with low-level wind speed suggesting that an important route for oxalate and malonate entry in cloudwater is via some combination of association with coarse particles and gaseous precursors emitted from the ocean surface. Three case flights show that oxalate (and no other organic acid) concentrations drop by nearly an order of magnitude relative to samples in the same vicinity. A consistent feature in these cases was an inverse relationship between oxalate and several metals (Fe, Mn, K, Na, Mg, Ca), especially Fe.

We decompose the changes in residential CO2 emissions in China and India into these five contributing factors from 1990 to 2011 by applying the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method. According to our results, the increase in per capita income level is the biggest contributor to the increase of residential CO2 emissions, while the energy intensity effect had the largest effect on CO2 emissions reduction in the residential sectors in both countries. This implies that investments for energy savings, technological improvements, and energy efficiency policies were effective in mitigating CO2 emissions. It is also found that the change in CO2 emission coefficients for fuels, which is the ratio of CO2 emissions arising from consumption of fuels to the consumption level slowed down the increase of residential emissions.

Backward air mass trajectories, satellite detections of fire areas and dispersion modelling results indicate that emissions from wildfires in Russia and other Eastern European countries arrived in Finland during these episodes. Elemental analyses using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive X-ray microanalyses (EDX) showed that the proportions of S-rich particles and agglomerates (agglomeration was caused partly by the sampling method used) increased during the episodes, and they contained elevated fractions of K, indicating emissions from biomass burning. These aerosols were mixed with S-rich emissions from fossil fuel burning during transport since air masses came through polluted areas of Europe. Minor amounts of coarse Ca-rich particles were also brought by LRT during the episodes, and they probably originated from wildfires and/or from Estonian and Russian oil-shale-burning industrial areas. Ion chromatography analysis showed that concentrations of sulphate (SO42-), total nitrate (NO3-+HNO3(g)) and total ammonium (NH4++NH3(g)) increased during the episodes, but the ratio of the total amount of these ions to PM10 concentration decreased, indicating unusually high fractions of other chemical components. Particle number size distribution measurements with differential mobility particle sizer (DMPS) revealed that concentrations of particles 90\u2013500 nm increased during the episodes, while concentrations of particles smaller than 90 nm decreased. The reduction of the smallest particles was caused by suppressed new particle formation due to vapour and molecular cluster uptake of LRT particles.

The chain with CCS comprises post-combustion CO2 capture with monoethanolamine, compression, transport by pipeline and storage in a geological reservoir. The two reference chains represent subcritical and state-of-the-art ultra supercritical pulverized coal fired electricity generation. For the three chains we have constructed a detailed greenhouse gas (GHG) balance, and disclosed environmental trade-offs and co-benefits due to CO2 capture, transport and storage. Results show that, due to CCS, the GHG emissions per kWh are reduced substantially to 243 g/kWh. This is a reduction of 78 and 71% compared to the sub-critical and stateof-the-art power plant, respectively. The removal of CO2 is partially offset by increased GHG emissions in upand downstream processes, to a small extent (0.7 g/kWh) caused by the CCS infrastructure. An environmental co-benefit is expected following from the deeper reduction of hydrogen fluoride and hydrogen chloride emissions. Most notable environmental trade-offs are the increase in human toxicity, ozone layer depletion and fresh water ecotoxicity potential for which the CCS chain is outperformed by both other chains. The state-of-the-art power plant without CCS also shows a better score for the eutrophication, acidification and photochemical oxidation potential despite the deeper reduction of SOx and NOx in the CCS power plant. These reductions are offset by increased emissions in the life cycle due to the energy penalty and a factor five increase in NH3 emissions. # 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Measurements were conducted on one of the ship's four main 12,600 kW medium-speed diesel engines which use low sulfur marine residual fuel and have a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system for NO(X) abatement. The particles were measured after the SCR with an engine exhaust particle sizer spectrometer (EEPS), giving particle number and mass distributions in the size range of 5.6-560 nm. The thermal characteristics of the particles were analyzed using a volatility tandem DMA system (VTDMA). A dilution ratio of 450-520 was used which is similar to the initial real-world dilution. At a stable engine load of 75% of the maximum rated power, and after dilution and cooling of the exhaust gas, there was a bimodal number size distribution, with a major peak at \u223c10 nm and a smaller peak at around 30-40 nm.

This paper describes aerosol modelling in Europe with a focus on Switzerland during summer and winter periods. We modelled PM2.5 (particles smaller than 2.5 \u03bcm in aerodynamic diameter) for one summer and two winter periods in years 2006 and 2007 using the CAMx air quality model. The meteorological fields were obtained from MM5 simulations. The modelled wind speeds during some low-wind periods, however, had to be calibrated with measurements to use realistic input for the air quality model. The detailed AMS (aerosol mass spectrometer) measurements at specific locations were used to evaluate the model results. In addition to the base case simulations, we carried out sensitivity tests with modified aerosol precursor emissions, air temperature and deposition. Aerosol concentrations in winter 2006 were twice as high as those in winter 2007, however, the chemical compositions were similar. CAMx could reproduce the relative composition of aerosols very well both in the winter and summer periods. Absolute concentrations of aerosol species were underestimated by about 20 %. Both measurements and model results suggest that organic aerosol (30\u201338 %) and particulate nitrate (30\u201336 %) are the main aerosol components in winter. In summer, organic aerosol dominates the aerosol composition (55\u201357 %) and is mainly of secondary origin. The contribution of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions to the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) was predicted to be very large (>95 %) in Switzerland. The main contributors to the modelled SOA concentrations were oxidation products of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes as well as oligomerization of oxidized compounds. The fraction of primary organic aerosol (POA) derived from measurements was lower than the model predictions indicating the importance of volatility of POA, which has not yet been taken into account in CAMx. Sensitivity tests with reduced NOx and NH3 emissions suggest that aerosol formation is more sensitive to ammonia emissions in winter in a large part of Europe. In Switzerland however, aerosol formation is predicted to be NOx-sensitive. In summer, effects of NOx and NH3 emission reductions on aerosol concentrations are predicted to be lower mostly due to lower ammonium nitrate concentrations.

We present two strategies whereby O3 damage to crops may be reduced. We first examine the potential benefits of an O3 mitigation strategy motivated by climate change goals: gradual emission reductions of methane (CH4), an important greenhouse gas and tropospheric O3 precursor that has not yet been targeted for O3 pollution abatement. Our second strategy focuses on adapting crops to O3 exposure by selecting cultivars with demonstrated O3 resistance. We find that the CH4 reductions considered would increase global production of soybean, maize, and wheat by 23\u2013102 Mt in 2030 \u2013 the equivalent of a ~2\u20138% increase in year 2000 production worth $3.5\u201315 billion worldwide (USD2000), increasing the cost effectiveness of this CH4 mitigation policy.

The strategies include (1) a\u00a0standard 4D-Var inversion at native model resolution (4\u00b0\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u00b0), (2) an inversion for six continental and three ocean regions, and (3) a\u00a0fast 4D-Var inversion based on a\u00a0novel dimension reduction technique employing randomized singular value decomposition (SVD).

Additional offsets are offsets that correspond to actual reductions in emissions. In contrast, non-additional offsets are offsets that do not correspond to emissions reductions. These offsets are created because offset projects with business-as-usual (BAU) emissions below their assigned baseline can claim offsets up to the baseline without reducing emissions. Since the sale and use of non-additional offsets by firms in climate mitigation programs has the effect of raising aggregate emissions, an extraordinary amount of focus has been on ensuring that offsets are additional. However, we show here that there is an emissions component that has been neglected in current policy design. This component, which we call Super-additional reductions, are emissions reductions which do not lead to a supply of offsets. Super-additional reductions arise from offset projects with BAU emissions above their baseline. These projects are awarded a quantity of offsets that is lower than the project's emissions reductions. The presence of such emissions reductions without supply of equivalent offsets has the effect of lowering aggregate emissions and lessening the impact of non-additional offsets. Our numerical simulations show that super-additional reductions can be as large as the supply of non-additional offsets, and in some scenarios can even exceed them.

The role of energy technologies is considered crucial in climate change mitigation. In particular, carbon capture and storage (CCS) promises to allow for low-emissions fossil-fuel based power generation. The technology is under development; a number of technological, economic, environmental and safety issues remain to be solved. With regard to its sustainability impact, CCS raises a number of questions: On the one hand, CCS may prolong the prevailing coal-to-electricity regime and countervail efforts in other mitigation categories. On the other hand, given the indisputable need to continue using fossil fuels for some time, it may serve as a bridging technology towards a sustainable energy future. In this paper, we discuss the relevant issues for the case of Germany. We provide a survey of the current state of the art of CCS and activities, and perform an energy-environment-economic analysis using a general equilibrium model for Germany. The model analyzes the impact of introducing carbon constraints with respect to the deployment of CCS, to the resulting greenhouse gas emissions, to the energy and technology mix and with respect to interaction of different mitigation efforts. The results show the relative importance of the components in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions in Germany. For example, under the assumption of a CO2 policy, both energy efficiency and CCS will contribute to climate gas mitigation. A given climate target can be achieved at lower marginal costs when the option of CCS is included.

In some regions, the highest impacts are mostly direct (92%, 95%, and 92% of total carbon emissions in the U.S., France, and UK, respectively), meaning that these emissions are linked to the inputs directly required for nuclear energy production; in other regions, indirect emissions are higher (83% in China), which becomes relevant for policy measures. Second, through the analyses of different scenarios, we unravel and quantify how different assumptions that are often taken in the literature result in different carbon emissions.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "f883b3ea5b790ee18d086e99f3dedb204c0d4218", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1982544503", "DOI": "10.1073/PNAS.96.24.13626", "CorpusId": 2535527, "PubMed": "10570123"}, "title": "Case study of the effects of atmospheric aerosols and regional haze on agriculture: an opportunity to enhance crop yields in China through emission controls?", "abstract": "The effect of atmospheric aerosols and regional haze from air pollution on the yields of rice and winter wheat grown in China is assessed. The assessment is based on estimates of aerosol optical depths over China, the effect of these optical depths on the solar irradiance reaching the earth's surface, and the response of rice and winter wheat grown in Nanjing to the change in solar irradiance. Two sets of aerosol optical depths are presented: one based on a coupled, regional climate/air quality model simulation and the other inferred from solar radiation measurements made over a 12-year period at meteorological stations in China. The model-estimated optical depths are significantly smaller than those derived from observations, perhaps because of errors in one or both sets of optical depths or because the data from the meteorological stations has been affected by local pollution. Radiative transfer calculations using the smaller, model-estimated aerosol optical depths indicate that the so-called \"direct effect\" of regional haze results in an approximately 5-30% reduction in the solar irradiance reaching some of China's most productive agricultural regions. Crop-response model simulations suggest an approximately 1:1 relationship between a percentage increase (decrease) in total surface solar irradiance and a percentage increase (decrease) in the yields of rice and wheat. Collectively, these calculations suggest that regional haze in China is currently depressing optimal yields of approximately 70% of the crops grown in China by at least 5-30%.

In order to reduce the risk of climate change and the potential effects thereof, the emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4 ) should be reduced. \nMuch greenhouse gases are emitted due to the combustion of fossil fuels. At present, these fuels fulfil about 60% of our global energy needs. Therefore, a more efficient use of fossil energy is generally viewed as an important option to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. A large part of global fossil energy use (about 40%) is consumed in the industrial sector to manufacture materials and products. Not surprisingly, several studies show that options that lead to more efficient use of materials often lead to reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, in current greenhouse gas emission reduction policies, not much attention is paid to more efficient material management as an option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n \nIn the introductory chapter, several studies are briefly discussed that focus on the material use of economies over time. The general conclusion of these studies is that for materials the consumption per unit GDP has decreased over the last decades, but that the total consumption of these materials is still growing due to economic growth. In this thesis the focus is on improved material management options that lead to greenhouse gas emission reduction. It aims to contribute to the following question: Which greenhouse gas emission reduction can be achieved potentially, by improved management of materials? The scope is limited in the number of product groups that are studied, the number of greenhouse gases studied and the geographical area. The question that is addressed in this thesis is therefore: Which greenhouse gas emission reduction, especially CO2 , can be achieved potentially in Western Europe or The Netherlands, by improved management of materials in the product groups 'packaging', 'residential buildings', and 'publication paper'", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "e0a8eab283fdbe1bd08b47ae9d795e6f4a30a3c5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2920818128", "DOI": "10.1007/s11356-019-04591-7", "CorpusId": 73474124, "PubMed": "30847812"}, "title": "The mystery of local fiscal expenditure and carbon emission growth in China", "abstract": "This study investigates the relationship between financial expenditure and carbon emission reduction using provincial-level dynamic panel data from 1996 to 2010.

The results of a several studies analyzing airline costs and emission reductions that are possible from different mitigation options are applied to a systems model of European aviation.

Some options are rapidly taken up under all scenarios (e.g., improved ATM), others are taken up more slowly by specific aircraft classes depending on the scenario (e.g., biofuels), and others have negligible impact in the cases studied.

In TEXTOR the causality between transport reduction and induced electric fields in the edge has been for the first time clearly demonstrated. The high electric field gradients have been identified as the cause for the quenching of turbulent cells. A quantitative analysis of the measured transport reduction is in good agreement with theoretical predictions. The scaling of plasma turbulence suppression with velocity shear has been established, revealing the density-potential cross-phase as a key element. Reduction in poloidal electric field, temperature, and density fluctuations across the shear layer lead to a reduction of the anomalous conducted and convected heat fluxes resulting in an energy transport barrier that is measured directly. In CASTOR the biasing electrode is placed at the separatrix in a non-intrusive configuration which has demonstrated strongly sheared electric fields and consequent improvement of the global particle confinement, as predicted by theory. The impact of sheared E\u00d7B flow on edge turbulent structures has been measured directly using a comprehensive set of electrostatic probe arrays as well as emissive probes. Measurements with a full poloidal Langmuir probe array have revealed quasi-coherent electrostatic waves in the SOL with a dominant mode number equal to the edge safety factor. In T-10 edge biasing is clearly improving the global performance of ECR heated discharges. Reflectometry and heavy ion beam probe measurements show the existence of a narrow plasma layer with strong suppression of turbulence.

A single side-firing optical fiber was used for both the delivery of 465 nm light-emitting diode excitation light and the collection of emitted fluorescence. It was placed interstitially within the prostate via a closed transparent plastic catheter. Fitting of the collected fluorescence emission spectra using the known fluorescence spectrum of 1 mg/kg MLu in an intralipid phantom yields a quantitative measure of the local MLu concentration. We found that an additional correction factor is needed to account for the reduction of the MLu fluorescence intensity measured in vivo due to strong optical absorption in the prostate. We have adopted an empirical correction formula given by C = (3.1 cm\u22121/\u03bc\u2032s) exp (\u03bceff\u00b70.97 cm), which ranges from approximately 3 to 16, with a mean of 9.3 \u00b1 4.8. Using a computer-controlled step motor to move the probe incrementally along parallel tracks within the prostate we can determine one-dimensional profiles of the MLu concentration. The absolute MLu concentration and the shape of its distribution are confirmed by ex vivo assay and by diffuse absorption measurements, respectively.

Many such cements are ideally suited to specialist applications in precast construction, road repair, and other fields including nuclear waste immobilization.

While economic analyses generally indicate that a broader market-based approach to GHG reduction would be less costly and more effective, regulatory approaches have found greater political success. We evaluate a global regulatory regime that replaces coal with natural gas in the electricity sector and imposes technically achievable improvements in the efficiency of personal transport vehicles. Its performance and cost are compared with other scenarios of future policy development including a no-policy world, achievements under the Copenhagen Accord, and a price-based policy to reduce global emissions by 50% by 2050. The assumed regulations applied globally achieve a global emissions reduction larger than projected for the Copenhagen agreements, but they do not prevent global GHG emissions from continuing to grow. The reduction in emissions is achieved at a high cost compared to a price-based policy. Diagnosis of the reasons for the limited yet high-cost performance reveals influences including the partial coverage of emitting sectors, small or no influence on the demand for emissions-intensive products, leakage when a reduction in fossil use in the covered sectors lowers the price to others, and the partial coverage of GHGs. If these regulatory measures are in part correcting other barriers or behavioural limitations consumers face, the benefits of overcoming these could offset at least some of the costs we estimate. The extent of any efficiency gap \u2013 the difference between engineering estimates of best practice and what actually happens \u2013 is highly contested, and offers an important avenue for future research. Policy relevance While analysts concerned with national cost of GHG control have long advocated a GHG pricing policy, by a cap-and-trade system or a tax, covering all emissions sources and gases, governments more often pursue sectoral policies and technology standards. Given these political realities, the regulations represent a more politically practical approach to GHG reductions, focusing on solutions that are within reach and that do not depend on technological breakthroughs. If regulations are imposed as a way to get started on larger emissions reductions, and then combined with a broader GHG pricing policy pursuing a deep global cut in emissions, its requirements will eventually be overtaken by the pricing policy. The remaining higher costs of the regulatory targets become diluted so that in later years the difference in average cost per ton between a least-cost approach and one preceded by a period of regulatory action becomes very small.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "f28e1bd1ef4f196feecc3f906c0689738a37a87d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2076882771", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1365-2389.2005.00708.x", "CorpusId": 96776376}, "title": "An overview of the permanence of soil organic carbon stocks: influence of direct human\u2010induced, indirect and natural effects", "abstract": "If biospheric sinks, such as soil organic carbon, are to be used to meet obligations for greenhouse gas emission reduction under the Kyoto Protocol, the permanence of these sinks needs to be considered.

CO-induced displacement of dtbp from 1 is reversible, but only in the presence of 1 equiv of unbound dtbp. The exceptionally strong donor ligand CH(3)NC displaces both dtbp ligands from 1. In contrast to the facile ligand displacement reactivity with good donor ligands, 1 does not react readily with O(2), by either a ligand displacement or an oxidative pathway. Rather, O(2) induces partial quenching of emission via an outer-sphere interaction with 1.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "5f20da86a8a4c98e4ddd67b3c71dad98752f6cf7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1976003596", "DOI": "10.2979/ETHICSENVIRO.19.1.31", "CorpusId": 143504239}, "title": "Climate Change: Against Despair", "abstract": "In the face of accelerating climate change and the parlous state of its politics, despair is tempting.

On the back of an analysis of despair as a loss of hope, the paper argues that the judgements grounding each form of despair are unsound. The paper concludes with consideration of the instrumental value of hope in effective agency to tackle climate change.

In this study the amount of capsular polysaccharide present on the bacterial surface during the infection process was illustrated by electron microscopic studies. After infection of A549 cells (type II pneumocytes) and HEp-2 epithelial cells a modified fixation method was used that allowed visualization of the state of capsule expression. This modified fixation procedure did not require the use of capsule-specific antibodies. Visualization of pneumococci in intimate contact and invading cells demonstrated that pneumococci were devoid of capsular polysaccharide. Pneumococci not in contact with the cells did not show alterations in capsular polysaccharide. After infection of the cells, invasive pneumococci of different strains and serotypes were recovered. Single colonies of these recovered pneumococci exhibited an up-to-105-fold-enhanced capacity to adhere and an up-to-104-fold-enhanced capacity to invade epithelial cells. Electron microscopic studies using a lysine-ruthenium red (LRR) fixation procedure or cryo-field emission scanning electron microscopy revealed a reduction in capsular material, as determined in detail for a serotype 3 pneumococcal strain. The amount of polysaccharide in the serotype 3 capsule was also determined after intranasal infection of mice. This study illustrates for the first time the phenotypic variation of the polysaccharide capsule in the initial phase of pneumococcal infections. The modified LRR fixation allowed monitoring of the state of capsule expression of pathogens during the infectious process.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "cadfa925f3ece962464b9cb825b8be8096417a71", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2344974644", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-17-7509-2017", "CorpusId": 32099425}, "title": "Methane emissions from dairies in the Los Angeles Basin", "abstract": "Abstract. We estimate the amount of methane\u00a0(CH4) emitted by the largest dairies in the southern California region by combining measurements from four mobile solar-viewing ground-based spectrometers\u00a0(EM27/SUN), in situ isotopic 13\u221512CH4 measurements from a CRDS analyzer (Picarro), and a high-resolution atmospheric transport simulation with a Weather Research and Forecasting model in large-eddy simulation mode\u00a0(WRF-LES). The remote sensing spectrometers measure the total column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CH4 and CO2 (XCH4 and XCO2) in the near infrared region, providing information on total emissions of the dairies at Chino. Differences measured between the four EM27/SUN ranged from 0.2\u00a0to 22\u202fppb (part per billion) and from 0.7\u00a0to 3\u202fppm (part per million) for XCH4 and XCO2, respectively. To assess the fluxes of the dairies, these differential measurements are used in conjunction with the local atmospheric dynamics from wind measurements at two local airports and from the WRF-LES simulations at 111\u202fm resolution. Our top-down CH4 emissions derived using the Fourier transform spectrometers\u00a0(FTS) observations of 1.4\u00a0to 4.8\u202fppt\u202fs\u22121 are in the low end of previous top-down estimates, consistent with reductions of the dairy farms and urbanization in the domain. However, the wide range of inferred fluxes points to the challenges posed by the heterogeneity of the sources and meteorology. Inverse modeling from WRF-LES is utilized to resolve the spatial distribution of CH4 emissions in the domain. Both the model and the measurements indicate heterogeneous emissions, with contributions from anthropogenic and biogenic sources at Chino. A Bayesian inversion and a Monte Carlo approach are used to provide the CH4 emissions of 2.2\u00a0to 3.5\u202fppt\u202fs\u22121 at Chino.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "2b2d68d2693a7ededa051a9450fb705782c12bbb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1850807508", "DOI": "10.1596/1813-9450-4933", "CorpusId": 54937299}, "title": "Tax Policy to Reduce Carbon Emissions in South Africa", "abstract": "Noting that South Africa may be one of the few African countries that could contribute to mitigating climate change, the authors explore the impact of a carbon tax relative to alternative energy taxes on economic welfare. Using a disaggregate general-equilibrium model of the South African economy, they capture the structural characteristics of the energy sector, linking a supply mix that is heavily skewed toward coal to energy use by different sectors and hence their carbon content. The authors consider a\"pure\"carbon tax as well as various proxy taxes such as those on energy or energy-intensive sectors like transport and basic metals, all of which achieve the same level of carbon reduction. In general, the more targeted the tax to carbon emissions, the better the welfare results. If a carbon tax is feasible, it will have the least marginal cost of abatement by a substantial amount when compared to alternative tax instruments. If a carbon tax is not feasible, a sales tax on energy inputs is the next best option. Moreover, labor market distortions such as labor market segmentation or unemployment will likely dominate the welfare and equity implications of a carbon tax for South Africa. This being the case, if South Africa were able to remove some of the distortions in the labor market, the cost of carbon taxation would be negligible. In short, the discussion of carbon taxation in South Africa can focus on considerations other than the economic welfare costs, which are likely to be quite low.", "year": 2009}]}
