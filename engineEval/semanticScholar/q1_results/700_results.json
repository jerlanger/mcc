In the eastern United States, substantial cuts in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions have considerably lowered particulate sulfate and nitrate concentrations for all seasons except winter. Simulations that reproduce detailed airborne observations of wintertime atmospheric chemistry over the eastern United States indicate that particulate sulfate and nitrate formation is limited by the availability of oxidants and by the acidity of fine particles, respectively. These limitations relax at lower ambient concentrations, forming particulate matter more efficiently, and weaken the effect of emission reductions. These results imply that larger emission reductions, especially during winter, are necessary for substantial improvements in wintertime air quality in the eastern United States. Sulfate (SO42-) and nitrate (NO3-) account for half of the fine particulate matter mass over the eastern United States. Their wintertime concentrations have changed little in the past decade despite considerable precursor emissions reductions. The reasons for this have remained unclear because detailed observations to constrain the wintertime gas\u2013particle chemical system have been lacking. We use extensive airborne observations over the eastern United States from the 2015 Wintertime Investigation of Transport, Emissions, and Reactivity (WINTER) campaign; ground-based observations; and the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to determine the controls on winter SO42- and NO3-. GEOS-Chem reproduces observed SO42-\u2013NO3-\u2013NH4+ particulate concentrations (2.45 \u03bcg sm-3) and composition (SO42-: 47%; NO3-: 32%; NH4+: 21%) during WINTER. Only 18% of SO2 emissions were regionally oxidized to SO42- during WINTER, limited by low [H2O2] and [OH]. Relatively acidic fine particulates (pH\u223c1.3) allow 45% of nitrate to partition to the particle phase. Using GEOS-Chem, we examine the impact of the 58% decrease in winter SO2 emissions from 2007 to 2015 and find that the H2O2 limitation on SO2 oxidation weakened, which increased the fraction of SO2 emissions oxidizing to SO42-. Simultaneously, NOx emissions decreased by 35%, but the modeled NO3- particle fraction increased as fine particle acidity decreased. These feedbacks resulted in a 40% decrease of modeled [SO42-] and no change in [NO3-], as observed. Wintertime [SO42-] and [NO3-] are expected to change slowly between 2015 and 2023, unless SO2 and NOx emissions decrease faster in the future than in the recent past.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "4460cd13b3b132d71194dee7a1c385c8183a7fb5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2917232902", "DOI": "10.18356/e21cbb9e-en", "CorpusId": 153238402}, "title": "Review of Maritime Transport, 2014", "abstract": "The Review of Maritime Transport is a recurrent publication prepared by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) secretariat since 1968 with the aim of fostering the transparency of maritime markets and analysing relevant developments.

Climate change can perturb the long-range transport, chemical processing, and local meteorology that influence air pollution. We review the implications of projected changes in methane (CH(4)), ozone precursors (O(3)), and aerosols for climate (expressed in terms of the radiative forcing metric or changes in global surface temperature) and hemispheric-to-continental scale air quality. Reducing the O(3) precursor CH(4) would slow near-term warming by decreasing both CH(4) and tropospheric O(3). Uncertainty remains as to the net climate forcing from anthropogenic nitrogen oxide (NO(x)) emissions, which increase tropospheric O(3) (warming) but also increase aerosols and decrease CH(4) (both cooling). Anthropogenic emissions of carbon monoxide (CO) and non-CH(4) volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) warm by increasing both O(3) and CH(4). Radiative impacts from secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are poorly understood. Black carbon emission controls, by reducing the absorption of sunlight in the atmosphere and on snow and ice, have the potential to slow near-term warming, but uncertainties in coincident emissions of reflective (cooling) aerosols and poorly constrained cloud indirect effects confound robust estimates of net climate impacts. Reducing sulfate and nitrate aerosols would improve air quality and lessen interference with the hydrologic cycle, but lead to warming. A holistic and balanced view is thus needed to assess how air pollution controls influence climate; a first step towards this goal involves estimating net climate impacts from individual emission sectors. Modeling and observational analyses suggest a warming climate degrades air quality (increasing surface O(3) and particulate matter) in many populated regions, including during pollution episodes. Prior Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios (SRES) allowed unconstrained growth, whereas the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios assume uniformly an aggressive reduction, of air pollutant emissions. New estimates from the current generation of chemistry-climate models with RCP emissions thus project improved air quality over the next century relative to those using the IPCC SRES scenarios. These two sets of projections likely bracket possible futures. We find that uncertainty in emission-driven changes in air quality is generally greater than uncertainty in climate-driven changes. Confidence in air quality projections is limited by the reliability of anthropogenic emission trajectories and the uncertainties in regional climate responses, feedbacks with the terrestrial biosphere, and oxidation pathways affecting O(3) and SOA.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "2f7231159c535e5340f6986057b5f24609dc3403", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2039570270", "DOI": "10.1063/1.1840828", "CorpusId": 94958551}, "title": "Field Emission through Atoms Adsorbed on a Metal Surface", "abstract": "An exactly solvable one\u2010dimensional pseudopotential model is employed to calculate the field\u2010emission probability and current from a free\u2010electron metal through both metallic and neutral absorbates.

In particular, the sustainability of many first-generation biofuels \u2013 which are produced primarily from food crops such as grains, sugar cane and vegetable oils \u2013 has been increasingly questioned over concerns such as reported displacement of food-crops, effects on the environment and climate change. In general, there is growing consensus that if significant emission reductions in the transport sector are to be achieved, biofuel technologies must become more efficient in terms of net lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions while at the same time be socially and environmentally sustainable. It is increasingly understood that most first-generation biofuels, with the exception of sugar cane ethanol, will likely have a limited role in the future transport fuel mix. The increasing criticism of the sustainability of many first-generation biofuels has raised attention to the potential of so-called second-generation biofuels. Depending on the feedstock choice and the cultivation technique, second-generation biofuel production has the potential to provide benefits such as consuming waste residues and making use of abandoned land. In this way, the new fuels could offer considerable potential to promote rural development and improve economic conditions in emerging and developing regions. However, while second-generation biofuel crops and production technologies are more efficient, their production could become unsustainable if they compete with food crops for available land.

Higher alcohol-gasoline blends with an oxygen mass content of 5.0 per cent showed a pronounced increase in NOx emission rates when operating at high compression ratios and 5\u00b0 before top dead centre timing.

Anthropogenic atmospheric emissions of typical toxic heavy metals have caused worldwide concern due to their adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem.

Intensive forest management and global climate change have had negative impacts on the quality of forest soils via soil acidification, reduction of soil organic carbon content, deterioration of soil biological properties, and reduction of soil biodiversity. The role of biochar in improving soil properties and the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been extensively documented in agricultural soils, while the effect of biochar application on forest soils remains poorly understood. Here, we review and summarize the available literature on the effects of biochar on soil properties and GHG emissions in forest soils.Materials and methodsThis review focuses on (1) the effect of biochar application on soil physical, chemical, and microbial properties in forest ecosystems; (2) the effect of biochar application on soil GHG emissions in forest ecosystems; and (3) knowledge gaps concerning the effect of biochar application on biogeochemical and ecological processes in forest soils.Results and discussionBiochar application to forests generally increases soil porosity, soil moisture retention, and aggregate stability while reducing soil bulk density. In addition, it typically enhances soil chemical properties including pH, organic carbon stock, cation exchange capacity, and the concentration of available phosphorous and potassium. Further, biochar application alters microbial community structure in forest soils, while the increase of soil microbial biomass is only a short-term effect of biochar application. Biochar effects on GHG emissions have been shown to be variable as reflected in significantly decreasing soil N2O emissions, increasing soil CH4 uptake, and complex (negative, positive, or negligible) changes of soil CO2 emissions. Moreover, all of the aforementioned effects are biochar-, soil-, and plant-specific.ConclusionsThe application of biochars to forest soils generally results in the improvement of soil physical, chemical, and microbial properties while also mitigating soil GHG emissions. Therefore, we propose that the application of biochar in forest soils has considerable advantages, and this is especially true for plantation soils with low fertility.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "73bbfb9d45c32505bdf29020bd5bbb19b0202cab", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2071770216", "DOI": "10.1002/JPLN.201400251", "CorpusId": 98259885}, "title": "The effect of nitrification inhibitors on the nitrous oxide (N2O) release from agricultural soils\u2014a review", "abstract": "The use of nitrification inhibitors (NI) is a technique which is able to improve N fertilizer use efficiency, to reduce nitrate leaching and to decrease the emission of the climate\u2010relevant gas N\u2082O simultaneously, particularly in moderately fertilized agricultural systems adapted to plant N demand. The ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) is the first enzyme which is involved in the oxidation of NH$ _4^+ $ to NO$ _3^ - $ in soils. The inhibition of the AMO by NIs directly decreases the nitrification rate and it reduces the NO$ _3^- $ concentration which serves as substrate for denitrification. Hence, the two main pathways of N\u2082O production in soils are blocked or their source strength is at least decreased. Although it has been shown that archaea are also able to oxidize NH\u2083, results from literature suggest that the enzymatic activity of NH\u2083oxidizing bacteria is the most important target for NIs because it was much stronger affected. The application of NIs to reduce N\u2082O emissions is most effective under conditions in which the NI remains close to the N \u2010 fertilizer. This is the case when the NI was sprayed on mineral \u2010 N fertilizer granules or thoroughly mixed with liquid fertilizers. Most serious problems of spatial separation of NI and substrate emerge on pasture soils, where N\u2082O hotspots occur under urine and to a lesser extent under manure patches. From the few studies on the effect of different NI quantities it seems that the amount of NI necessary to reduce N\u2082O emissions is below the recommendations for NI amounts in practice. NIs can improve the fertilizer value of liquid manure. For instance, the addition of NIs to slurry can increase N uptake and yield of crops when NO$ _3^ - $ \u2010 N leaching losses are reduced. It has clearly been demonstrated that NIs added to cattle slurry are very effective in reducing N\u2082O as well as NO emissions after surface application and injection of slurry into grassland soils. In flooded rice systems NIs can reduce CH\u2084emission significantly, whereas the effect on CO\u2082emission is varying. On the other hand, as an effect of the delay of nitrification by NIs, NH\u2083emission might increase when N fertilizers are not incorporated into the soil. As compared to other measures NIs have a high potential to reduce N\u2082O emissions from agricultural soils. Further, no other measure has so consistently been proofed according its efficiency to reduce N\u2082O emissions. From the published data [Akiyama et al. (2010) and more recent data from the years 2010\u20132013; 140 data sets in total] a reduction potential of approx. 35% seems realistic; however, further measurements in different management systems, particularly in regions with intense frost/thaw cycles seem necessary to confirm this reduction potential.

Intrinsically, concrete has a very low energy and carbon footprint compared to most other materials. However, the volume of Portland cement required for concrete construction makes the cement industry a large emitter of CO2. The International Energy Agency recently proposed a global CO2 reduction plan. This plan has three main elements: long term CO2 targets, a sectorial approach based on the lowest cost to society, and technology roadmaps that demonstrate the means to achieve the CO2 reductions. For the cement industry, this plan calls for a reduction in CO2 emissions from 2\u00a0Gt in 2007 to 1.55\u00a0Gt in 2050, while over the same period cement production is projected to increase by about 50\u00a0%. The authors of the cement industry roadmap point out that the extrapolation of existing technologies (fuel efficiency, alternative fuels and biomass, and clinker substitution) will only take us half the way towards these goals. According to the roadmap, the industry will have to rely on costly and unproven carbon capture and storage technologies for the other half of the required reduction. This will result in significant additional costs for society. Most of the CO2 footprint of cement is due to the decarbonation of limestone during the clinkering process. Designing new clinkers that require less limestone is one means to significantly reduce the CO2 footprint of cement and concrete.

Phase 2 RFG was introduced in the San Francisco Bay Area in the first half of 1996, resulting in large changes to gasoline composition. Oxygen content increased from 0.2 to 2.0 wt%; and alkene, aromatic, benzene, and sulfur contents decreased. Gasoline density and T50 and T90 distillation temperatures also decreased. Light-duty vehicle emissions rates were measured in a Bay Area roadway tunnel in summers 1994-1997. Vehicle speeds and driving conditions inside the tunnel were similar each year. The average model year of the vehicle fleet was about one year newer each successive summer. Large reductions in pollutant emissions were measured in the tunnel over the course of this study, due to a combination of RFG and fleet turnover effects. Between summers 1994 and 1997, emissions of carbon monoxide decreased by 31 \u00b1 5%, non-methane volatile organic compounds (VOC) decreased by 43 \u00b1 8%, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) decreased by 18 \u00b1 4%. It was difficult to separate clearly the fleet turnover and RFG contributions to these changes. Nevertheless, it was clear that the effect of RFG was greater for VOC than for NOx. The RFG effect on vehicle emissions of benzene was estimated to be a 30-40% reduction. Use of RFG increased formaldehyde emissions by about 10%, while acetaldehyde emissions did not change significantly. RFG effects reported here may not be the same for other driving conditions or for other vehicle fleets. RFG effects on evaporative emissions are also important.

The emissions of CH4, N2O and CO2 from manure stored as slurry, stockpile, and compost were measured using a flow-through closed chamber. The largest combined N2O\u2013CH4 emissions in CO2 equivalent were observed from the slurry storage, followed by the stockpile and lastly the passively aerated compost.

The radiative forcing in CO2 equivalent from the stockpiled manure was 1.46 times higher than from the compost for both types of cattle manure. It was almost twice as high from the dairy cattle manure slurry and four to seven times higher from the beef cattle manure slurry than from the compost.

Some progress has been made in reducing NOx emissions through the use of combustion and exhaust control schemes, including three-way catalyst, staged combustion, and ammonia injection. Nevertheless, estimates indicate that the production of nitrogen oxides will continue to increase until the end of the century and beyond, if current trends continue2. We describe here a new chemical process capable of completely removing NOx from the products of combustion. The effectiveness of this process is established in flow tube experiments. Further, we demonstrate the practical feasibility of this method by eliminating NOx from a portion of the exhaust from a single-cylinder diesel engine. Based on these results we conclude that this process for rapid reduction of nitrogen oxides could play a major role in controlling NOx emissions from most combustion devices.", "year": 1986}, {"paperId": "4d32f1199acdcf5c985af0fac779d01eb618f307", "externalIds": {"MAG": "579764844", "CorpusId": 106877534}, "title": "EMISSIONS REDUCTION THROUGH BETTER TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT: AN EMPIRICAL EVALUATION BASED UPON ON-ROAD MEASUREMENTS", "abstract": "The objectives of this study were to: (1) evaluate a new low-cost approach for measuring on-road tailpipe emissions of highway vehicles; (2) investigate factors that affect the amount and variability of on-road emissions, using statistical methods; and (3) devise and demonstrate methods for designing and conducting observational experiments that realistically evaluate pollution prevention strategies for on-road vehicles. Portable instruments were used for measuring carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions and vehicle activity (e.g., vehicle speed, engine parameters) on a second-by-second basis. Data collection, quality assurance, reduction, and analysis protocols were developed. Field data collection occurred in a pilot and an evaluation phase. In total, over 1,200 one-way trips were made with more than 20 vehicles, 4,000 vehicle-miles traveled, 160 hours of data, and 10 drivers. The pilot study was used to identify key factors influencing on-road emissions and as input to the design of the evaluation study. In the evaluation study, data were collected intensively with a small number of vehicles on two corridors before and after signal timing and coordination changes were implemented. For the first corridor, changes in signal timing and coordination did not result in a significant change in traffic flow or emissions. However, substantial reductions in emissions were estimated for uncongested versus congested traffic flow when comparing travel in the same direction at different times of day. For the second corridor, there were significant improvements in traffic flow and some reduction in emissions for three of the four time period and travel direction combinations evaluated. The impact of signal timing and coordination changes with respect to non-priority movements involving cross-streets was evaluated. For the first corridor, there was no statistically significant observed change in emissions for non-priority movements. For the second corridor, there typically was a decrease in average speed and an increase in emissions for non-priority movements; however, many of the observed changes were not statistically significant. The study also demonstrated other analysis methods, including: (a) macro-scale analysis of trip average emissions and traffic parameters; (b) micro-scale analysis of second-by-second emissions and vehicle operation; (c) mesoscale analysis of modal emission rates; and (d) spatial analysis of emissions at specific locations along the corridors.

Masking agents, enzymes and bacterial preparations, feed additives, chemicals, oxidation processes, air scrubbers, biofilters, and new ventilation systems have been studied. Research relating the effects of the swine diet on manure odors has been scarce. Introducing feed additives to bind ammonia, change digesta pH, affect specific enzyme activity, and mask odors has been either costly or not consistently successful. Recent research emphasis has focused on manipulating the diet 1) to increase the nutrient utilization of the diet to reduce excretion products, 2) to enhance microbial metabolism in the lower digestive tract to reduce excretion of odor-causing compounds, and 3) to change the physical characteristics of urine and feces to reduce odor emissions. Primary odor-causing compounds evolve from excess degradable proteins and lack of specific fermentable carbohydrates during microbial fermentation. Reductions in ammonia emissions by 28 to 79% through diet modifications have been reported. Limited research on reduction of other odorous volatile organic compounds through diet modifications is promising. Use of synthetic amino acids with reduced intact protein levels in diets significantly reduces nitrogen excretions and odor production. Addition of nonstarch polysaccharides and specific oligosaccharides further alters the pathway of nitrogen excretion and reduces odor emission. Continued nutritional and microbial research to incorporate protein degradation products, especially sulfur-containing organics, with fermentable carbohydrates in the lower gastrointestinal tract of pigs will further control odors from manure.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "cd1f7725147b948cac962c4ce68a51d894ba21ad", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2036661819", "DOI": "10.1109/15.8769", "CorpusId": 110845377}, "title": "Diagnosis and reduction of conducted noise emissions", "abstract": "A systematic method for the diagnosis and reduction of conducted noise emissions is described.

Ice is very weakly absorptive in the visible (minimum absorption at \u03bb = 0.46 \u00b5m) but has strong absorption bands in the near infrared (near IR). Snow albedo is therefore much lower in the near IR. The near-IR solar irradiance thus plays an important role in snowmelt and in the energy balance at a snow surface. The near-IR albedo is very sensitive to snow grain size and moderately sensitive to solar zenith angle. The visible albedo (for pure snow) is not sensitive to these parameters but is instead affected by snowpack thickness and parts-per-million amounts (or less) of impurities. Grain size normally increases as the snow ages, causing a reduction in albedo. If the grain size increases as a function of depth, the albedo may suffer more reduction in the visible or in the near IR, depending on the rate of grain size increase. The presence of liquid water has little effect per se on snow optical properties in the solar spectrum, in contrast to its enormous effect on microwave emissivity. Snow albedo is increased at all wavelengths as the solar zenith angle increases but is most sensitive around \u03bb =1 \u00b5m. Many apparently conflicting measurements of the zenith angle dependence of albedo are difficult to interpret because of modeling error, instrument error, and inadequate documentation of grain size, surface roughness, and incident radiation spectrum. Cloud cover affects snow albedo both by converting direct radiation into diffuse radiation and also by altering the spectral distribution of the radiation. Cloud cover normally causes an increase in spectrally integrated snow albedo. Some measurements of spectral flux extinction in snow are difficult to reconcile with the spectral albedo measurements. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function which apportions the reflected solar radiation among the various reflection angles must be known in order to interpret individual satellite measurements. It has been measured at the snow surface and at the top of the atmosphere, but its dependence on wavelength, snow grain size, and surface roughness is still unknown. Thermal infrared emissivity of snow is close to 100% but is a few percent lower at large viewing angles than for overhead viewing. It is very insensitive to grain size, impurities, snow depth, liquid water content, or density. Solar reflectance and microwave emissivity are both sensitive to various of these snowpack parameters. However, none of these parameters can be uniquely determined by satellite measurements at a single wavelength; a multichannel method is thus necessary if they are to be determined by remote sensing.", "year": 1982}, {"paperId": "c80afb241f6b1a0934e6c2237914b3b0290d5bdf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2017270512", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1757-1707.2011.01149.x", "CorpusId": 54997743}, "title": "Is woody bioenergy carbon neutral?

However, if current harvest levels are increased to produce more bioenergy, carbon that would have been stored in the biosphere might be instead released in the atmosphere. This study utilizes a comparative approach that considers emissions under alternative energy supply options. This approach shows that the emission benefits of bioenergy compared to use of fossil fuel are time\u2010dependent. It emerges that the assumption that bioenergy always results in zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to use of fossil fuels can be misleading, particularly in the context of short\u2010to\u2010medium term goals. While it is clear that all sources of woody bioenergy from sustainably managed forests will produce emission reductions in the long term, different woody biomass sources have various impacts in the short\u2010medium term. The study shows that the use of forest residues that are easily decomposable can produce GHG benefits compared to use of fossil fuels from the beginning of their use and that biomass from dedicated plantations established on marginal land can be carbon neutral from the beginning of its use. However, the risk of short\u2010to\u2010medium term negative impacts is high when additional fellings are extracted to produce bioenergy and the proportion of felled biomass used for bioenergy is low, or when land with high C stocks is converted to low productivity bioenergy plantations. The method used in the study provides an instrument to identify the time\u2010dependent pattern of emission reductions for alternative bioenergy sources.

Variation in dietary N intake will particularly affect excretion of urinary N, which is much more vulnerable to losses than is faecal N. Our objective is to review dietary effects on the level and form of N excreted in cattle urine, as well as its consequences for emissions of N2O. The quantity of N excreted in urine varies widely. Urinary N excretion, in particular that of urea N, is decreased upon reduction of dietary N intake or an increase in the supply of energy to the rumen microorganisms and to the host animal itself. Most of the N in urine (from 50% to well over 90%) is present in the form of urea. Other nitrogenous components include purine derivatives (PD), hippuric acid, creatine and creatinine. Excretion of PD is related to rumen microbial protein synthesis, and that of hippuric acid to dietary concentration of degradable phenolic acids. The N concentration of cattle urine ranges from 3 to 20 g/l. High-dietary mineral levels increase urine volume and lead to reduced urinary N concentration as well as reduced urea concentration in plasma and milk. In lactating dairy cattle, variation in urine volume affects the relationship between milk urea and urinary N excretion, which hampers the use of milk urea as an accurate indicator of urinary N excretion. Following its deposition in pastures or in animal houses, ubiquitous microorganisms in soil and waters transform urinary N components into ammonium (NH4 +), and thereafter into NO3 - and ultimately in N2 accompanied with the release of N2O. Urinary hippuric acid, creatine and creatinine decompose more slowly than urea. Hippuric acid may act as a natural inhibitor of N2O emissions, but inhibition conditions have not been defined properly yet. Environmental and soil conditions at the site of urine deposition or manure application strongly influence N2O release. Major dietary strategies to mitigating N2O emission from cattle operations include reducing dietary N content or increasing energy content, and increasing dietary mineral content to increase urine volume.

With the rapid development of the economy, the sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission from China since 2000 is of increasing concern. In this study, we estimate the annual SO2 emission in China after 2000 using a technology-based methodology specifically for China. From 2000 to 2006, total SO2 emission in China increased by 53%, from 21.7 Tg to 33.2 Tg, at an annual growth rate of 7.3%. Emissions from power plants are the main sources of SO2 in China and they increased from 10.6 Tg to 18.6 Tg in the same period. Geographically, emission from north China increased by 85%, whereas that from the south increased by only 28%. The emission growth rate slowed around 2005, and emissions began to decrease after 2006 mainly due to the wide application of flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) devices in power plants in response to a new policy of China's government. This paper shows that the trend of estimated SO2 emission in China is consistent with the trends of SO2 concentration and acid rain pH and frequency in China, as well as with the increasing trends of background SO2 and sulfate concentration in East Asia. A longitudinal gradient in the percentage change of urban SO2 concentration in Japan is found during 2000\u20132007, indicating that the decrease of urban SO2 is lower in areas close to the Asian continent. This implies that the transport of increasing SO2 from the Asian continent partially counteracts the local reduction of SO2 emission downwind. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) products of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are found to be highly correlated with the surface solar radiation (SSR) measurements in East Asia. Using MODIS AOD data as a surrogate of SSR, we found that China and East Asia excluding Japan underwent a continuous dimming after 2000, which is in line with the dramatic increase in SO2 emission in East Asia. The trends of AOD from both satellite retrievals and model over East Asia are also consistent with the trend of SO2 emission in China, especially during the second half of the year, when sulfur contributes the largest fraction of AOD. The arrested growth in SO2 emissions since 2006 is also reflected in the decreasing trends of SO2 and SO42\u2212 concentrations, acid rain pH values and frequencies, and AOD over East Asia.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "c4ea1aa29b297eec3949901fdaf97654e213b04b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2025703850", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1116645109", "CorpusId": 1626134, "PubMed": "22611187"}, "title": "Assessment of ground-based atmospheric observations for verification of greenhouse gas emissions from an urban region", "abstract": "International agreements to limit greenhouse gas emissions require verification to ensure that they are effective and fair.

We test the method with observations from a network of CO2 surface monitors in Salt Lake City. Many features of the CO2 data were simulated with excellent fidelity, although data-model mismatches occurred on hourly timescales due to inadequate simulation of shallow circulations and the precise timing of boundary-layer stratification and destratification. Using two optimization procedures, monthly regional fluxes were constrained to sufficient precision to detect an increase or decrease in emissions of approximately 15% at the 95% confidence level.

Therefore, the increased use of natural gas has led to emission reductions of NOx (40%) and SO2 (44%), in addition to those obtained from the implementation of emission control systems on coal power plants.

Emphasis is on low-temperature deNOx, durability, and cost reduction. PM (particulate matter) reduction technologies are evolving around SCR integration and the behavior of soot and ash deposits. Next, DOC (diesel oxidation catalyst) developments are summarized. They mainly involve better understanding of aging and substitution of base metals oxides for precious metal. The paper then discusses some key developments in gasoline emission controls, focusing on new coated GPF (gasoline particulate filter) understanding.

The paper starts with the key regulatory advancements in the field, including newly proposed Non-Road Mobile Machinery regulations for 2019-20 in Europe, and the continuing developments towards real driving emissions (RDE) standards. An expert panel in India proposed a roadmap through 2025 for clean fuels and tailpipe regulations. LD (light duty) and HD (heavy-duty) engine technology continues showing marked improvements in engine efficiency. Key developments are summarized for gasoline and diesel engines to meet both the emerging NOx and GHG regulations. HD engines are demonstrating more than 50% brake thermal efficiency using methods that can reasonably be commercialized. Next, NOx control technologies are summarized, including SCR (selective catalytic reduction), lean NOx traps, and combination systems. Emphasis is on durability and control. Diesel PM (particulate matter) reduction findings are evolving around the behavior of the soot cake and PM sensors. Gasoline particulates are further described and gasoline particulate filter regeneration is now better understood. Oxidation catalysts mainly involve developments towards stubborn problems, like sulfur tolerance, low-temperature performance with exhaust with high hydrocarbon and CO, and methane oxidation. Finally, the paper discusses some key developments in gasoline gaseous emission control, focusing on meeting new regulatory requirements in the US, durability, and on lean burn gasoline emissions control.

We integrate life cycle assessment (LCA) and forest carbon analysis to assess total GHG emissions of forest bioenergy over time. Application of the method to case studies of wood pellet and ethanol production from forest biomass reveals a substantial reduction in forest carbon due to bioenergy production. For all cases, harvest-related forest carbon reductions and associated GHG emissions initially exceed avoided fossil fuel-related emissions, temporarily increasing overall emissions. In the long term, electricity generation from pellets reduces overall emissions relative to coal, although forest carbon losses delay net GHG mitigation by 16-38 years, depending on biomass source (harvest residues/standing trees). Ethanol produced from standing trees increases overall emissions throughout 100 years of continuous production: ethanol from residues achieves reductions after a 74 year delay. Forest carbon more significantly affects bioenergy emissions when biomass is sourced from standing trees compared to residues and when less GHG-intensive fuels are displaced. In all cases, forest carbon dynamics are significant.

While there have been many estimates of global CH4 emissions from rice fields, none of them have been obtained using the IPCC guidelines. Therefore, we used the Tier 1 method described in the 2006 IPCC guidelines to estimate the global CH4 emissions from rice fields. To accomplish this, we used country\u2010specific statistical data regarding rice harvest areas and expert estimates of relevant agricultural activities. The estimated global emission for 2000 was 25.6 Tg a\u22121, which is at the lower end of earlier estimates and close to the total emission summarized by individual national communications. Monte Carlo simulation revealed a 95% uncertainty range of 14.8\u201341.7 Tg a\u22121; however, the estimation uncertainty was found to depend on the reliability of the information available regarding the amount of organic amendments and the area of rice fields that were under continuous flooding. We estimated that if all of the continuously flooded rice fields were drained at least once during the growing season, the CH4 emissions would be reduced by 4.1 Tg a\u22121. Furthermore, we estimated that applying rice straw off season wherever and whenever possible would result in a further reduction in emissions of 4.1 Tg a\u22121 globally. Finally, if both of these mitigation options were adopted, the global CH4 emission from rice paddies could be reduced by 7.6 Tg a\u22121.

We find that plug-in vehicles may reduce or increase externality costs relative to grid-independent HEVs, depending largely on greenhouse gas and SO2 emissions produced during vehicle charging and battery manufacturing. However, even if future marginal damages from emissions of battery and electricity production drop dramatically, the damage reduction potential of plug-in vehicles remains small compared to ownership cost. As such, to offer a socially efficient approach to emissions and oil consumption reduction, lifetime cost of plug-in vehicles must be competitive with HEVs. Current subsidies intended to encourage sales of plug-in vehicles with large capacity battery packs exceed our externality estimates considerably, and taxes that optimally correct for externality damages would not close the gap in ownership cost. In contrast, HEVs and PHEVs with small battery packs reduce externality damages at low (or no) additional cost over their lifetime. Although large battery packs allow vehicles to travel longer distances using electricity instead of gasoline, large packs are more expensive, heavier, and more emissions intensive to produce, with lower utilization factors, greater charging infrastructure requirements, and life-cycle implications that are more sensitive to uncertain, time-sensitive, and location-specific factors.

The Committee on Climate Change have modelled the impact on GHG emissions of three dietary scenarios for food consumption in the UK.

The three scenarios were parameterised by fruit and vegetables, fibre, total fat, saturated fat, monounsaturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, cholesterol and salt using the 2008 Family Food Survey. A Monte Carlo simulation generated 95% credible intervals.RESULTS:Scenario 1 (50% reduction in meat and dairy replaced by fruit, vegetables and cereals: 19% reduction in GHG emissions) resulted in 36\u2009910 (30\u2009192 to 43\u2009592) deaths delayed or averted per year. Scenario 2 (75% reduction in cow and sheep meat replaced by pigs and poultry: 9% reduction in GHG emissions) resulted in 1999 (1739 to 2389) deaths delayed or averted. Scenario 3 (50% reduction in pigs and poultry replaced with fruit, vegetables and cereals: 3% reduction in GHG emissions) resulted in 9297 (7288 to 11\u2009301) deaths delayed or averted.CONCLUSION:Modelled results suggest that public health and climate change dietary goals are in broad alignment with the largest results in both domains occurring when consumption of all meat and dairy products are reduced.

First, the paper covers the key regulatory developments in the field, including proposed light-duty (LD) criteria pollutant tightening in the US; and in Europe, the continuing developments towards real-world driving emissions (RDE) standards. Significant shifts are occurring in China and India in addressing their severe air quality problems. The paper then gives a brief, high-level overview of key developments in fuels. Projections are that we are in the early stages of oil supply stability, which could stabilize fuel prices. LD and HD (heavy-duty) engine technology continues showing marked improvements in engine efficiency. Key developments are summarized for gasoline and diesel engines to meet both the emerging NOx and GHG regulations. HD engines are or will soon be demonstrating 50% brake thermal efficiency using common approaches. NOx control technologies are then summarized, including SCR (selective catalytic reduction) systems and SCR filter developments. Emphasis is on low-temperature deNOx and integration of components and control. Diesel PM (particulate matter) reduction technologies are evolving around the behavior of ash deposits and SCR integration. Filters for direct injection gasoline applications are developing very rapidly, and in some cases the back pressure, light-off characteristics, and emissions reductions are very similar to standard three way catalysts (TWCs). Oxidation catalysts mainly involve developments towards stubborn problems, like low-temperature performance with exhaust with high hydrocarbon and CO, and methane oxidation. Finally, the paper discusses some key developments in gasoline gaseous emission control, focusing on matching engine calibration with emissions system characteristics; and on lean burn gasoline emissions control.

Moreover, a geographically explicit life-cycle analysis that tracks PM2.5 emissions and exposure relative to U.S. population shows regional shifts in health costs dependent on fuel production systems. Because cellulosic ethanol can offer health benefits from PM2.5 reduction that are of comparable importance to its climate-change benefits from GHG reduction, a shift from gasoline to cellulosic ethanol has greater advantages than previously recognized.

Several recent papers suggest that dung beetles may affect fluxes of GHGs from cattle farming. Here, we put these previous findings into context. Using Finland as an example, we assessed GHG emissions at three scales: the dung pat, pasture ecosystem, and whole lifecycle of milk or beef production. At the first two levels, dung beetles reduced GHG emissions by up to 7% and 12% respectively, mainly through large reductions in methane (CH4) emissions. However, at the lifecycle level, dung beetles accounted for only a 0.05\u20130.13% reduction of overall GHG emissions. This mismatch derives from the fact that in intensive production systems, only a limited fraction of all cow pats end up on pastures, offering limited scope for dung beetle mitigation of GHG fluxes. In contrast, we suggest that the effects of dung beetles may be accentuated in tropical countries, where more manure is left on pastures, and dung beetles remove and aerate dung faster, and that this is thus a key area for future research. These considerations give a new perspective on previous results perspective, and suggest that studies of biotic effects on GHG emissions from dung pats on a global scale are a priority for current research.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "348a11a0b70e4dde1f7b488c1e04aa224dc4f02d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1971632124", "DOI": "10.1126/science.1181637", "CorpusId": 206523323, "PubMed": "19779157"}, "title": "Carbon Capture and Sequestration", "abstract": "Overwhelming scientific evidence shows that CO2 emissions from fossil fuels have caused the climate to change, and a dramatic reduction of these emissions is essential to reduce the risk of future devastating effects.

We studied the effect of biochar and dried swine manure additions on changes in soil bulk density (D b ), total soil organic carbon (SOC), and emissions of N 2 O and CO, during a 500-d soil column incubation study. The addition of biochar to the soil increased SOC content measured after the 500-d incubation by 17.6 to 68.8%, depending on the treatment. Biochar additions reduced N 2 O emissions measured once near the end of the incubation. The N 2 O emissions were weakly correlated with D b , suggesting that enhanced soil aeration contributed to the reductions in N 2 O emissions.

The high end of this range is only possible if total historical aerosol forcing is relatively small. More realistic emission reductions would likely provide an even smaller climate benefit. We find that the climate benefit from reductions in short-lived forcing agents are smaller than previously estimated. These near-term climate benefits of targeted reductions in short-lived forcers are not substantially different in magnitude from the benefits from a comprehensive climate policy.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "0029fd11d60b4728860295fd280b4a885624bda6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2323683972", "DOI": "10.1021/es2022347", "CorpusId": 5356912, "PubMed": "21939216"}, "title": "Impact assessment of ammonia emissions on inorganic aerosols in East China using response surface modeling technique.", "abstract": "Ammonia (NH(3)) is one important precursor of inorganic fine particles; however, knowledge of the impacts of NH(3) emissions on aerosol formation in China is very limited. In this study, we have developed China's NH(3) emission inventory for 2005 and applied the Response Surface Modeling (RSM) technique upon a widely used regional air quality model, the Community Multi-Scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ). The purpose was to analyze the impacts of NH(3) emissions on fine particles for January, April, July, and October over east China, especially those most developed regions including the North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River delta (YRD), and the Pearl River delta (PRD). The results indicate that NH(3) emissions contribute to 8-11% of PM(2.5) concentrations in these three regions, comparable with the contributions of SO(2) (9-11%) and NO(x) (5-11%) emissions. However, NH(3), SO(2), and NO(x) emissions present significant nonlinear impacts; the PM(2.5) responses to their emissions increase when more control efforts are taken mainly because of the transition between NH(3)-rich and NH(3)-poor conditions. Nitrate aerosol (NO(3)(-)) concentration is more sensitive to NO(x) emissions in NCP and YRD because of the abundant NH(3) emissions in the two regions, but it is equally or even more sensitive to NH(3) emissions in the PRD. In high NO(3)(-) pollution areas such as NCP and YRD, NH(3) is sufficiently abundant to neutralize extra nitric acid produced by an additional 25% of NO(x) emissions. The 90% increase of NH(3) emissions during 1990-2005 resulted in about 50-60% increases of NO(3)(-) and SO(4)(2-) aerosol concentrations. If no control measures are taken for NH(3) emissions, NO(3)(-) will be further enhanced in the future. Control of NH(3) emissions in winter, spring, and fall will benefit PM(2.5) reduction for most regions. However, to improve regional air quality and avoid exacerbating the acidity of aerosols, a more effective pathway is to adopt a multipollutant strategy to control NH(3) emissions in parallel with current SO(2) and NO(x) controls in China.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "da2b2729d633b71379403a621550c11024557965", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2082733505", "DOI": "10.1126/SCIENCE.7618082", "CorpusId": 10999448, "PubMed": "7618082"}, "title": "Age-related reductions in human recognition memory due to impaired encoding.", "abstract": "The participation of the medial temporal cortex and other cerebral structures in the memory impairment that accompanies aging was examined by means of positron emission tomography.

Design considerations include which sectors to tax, where to set the tax rate, how to use tax revenues, what the impact will be on consumers, and how to ensure that emissions reduction goals are achieved. Emissions reductions that are due to carbon taxes can be difficult to measure, although some jurisdictions quantify reductions in overall emissions, others examine impacts that are due to programmes funded by carbon tax revenues.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "7d20bbe9b8b2eb668c5972ac88195897325df1ac", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2109229209", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-10-4377-2010", "CorpusId": 40710069}, "title": "A global perspective on aerosol from low-volatility organic compounds", "abstract": "Abstract. Global production of organic aerosol from primary emissions of semivolatile (SVOCs) and intermediate (IVOCs) volatility organic compounds is estimated using the global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem. SVOC oxidation is predicted to be a larger global source of net aerosol production than oxidation of traditional parent hydrocarbons (terpenes, isoprene, and aromatics). Using a prescribed rate constant and reduction in volatility for atmospheric oxidation, the yield of aerosol from SVOCs is predicted to be about 75% on a global, annually-averaged basis. For IVOCs, the use of a naphthalene-like surrogate with different high-NOx and low-NOx parameterizations produces a global aerosol yield of about 30%, or roughly 5 Tg/yr of aerosol. Estimates of the total global organic aerosol source presented here range between 60 and 100 Tg/yr. This range reflects uncertainty in the parameters for SVOC volatility, SVOC oxidation, SVOC emissions, and IVOC emissions, as well as wet deposition. The highest estimates result if SVOC emissions are significantly underestimated (by more than a factor of 2) or if wet deposition of the gas-phase semivolatile species is less effective than previous estimates. A significant increase in SVOC emissions, a reduction of the volatility of the SVOC emissions, or an increase in the enthalpy of vaporization of the organic aerosol all lead to an appreciable reduction of prediction/measurement discrepancy. In addition, if current primary organic aerosol (POA) inventories capture only about one-half of the SVOC emission and the Henrys Law coefficient for oxidized semivolatiles is on the order of 103 M/atm, a global estimate of OA production is not inconsistent with the top-down estimate of 140 Tg/yr by (Goldstein and Galbally, 2007). Additional information is needed to constrain the emissions and treatment of SVOCs and IVOCs, which have traditionally not been included in models.", "year": 2010}]}
