The paddy soil was maintained under either air-dried (sample D) or submerged (sample F) conditions for 110 d before the soil was adjusted into soil moisture of 20% , 40% , 60% , 80% and 100% water holding capacity (WH(-2)) respectively, and then incubated with or without 10% (v/v) acetylene for 138 h at 25 degrees C. At lower soil water content (< or = 60% WHC), N2O emission from the sample F was 2.29 times higher than that from the sample D (P < 0.01). While, N2O emission from the sample F was only 29 and 14 percent of that from the sample D at the soil moisture of 80% and 100% WHC, respectively (P < 0.01). The maximal N2O emissions observed at soil moisture of 80% WHC were about 24 and 186 times higher than the minima obtained at the soil moisture of 20% WHC for the sample F and D, respectively. But at the soil moisture of 80% and 100% WHC, N2O emission from the sample F with acetylene (F + ACE) was comparable to that of the sample D with acetylene (D + ACE). The results showed that the F sample produced N2O ability in denitrification was similar to the sample D, however, the sample F was in the better reduction of N2O to N, than the sample D even after the soil moisture was adjusted into the same level of 80% or 100% WHC. Therefore, the pretreatment of water regime influenced the strength and product composition of denitrification and N2O emission from the paddy soil.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "84c56456c309e6147cbc119032700291730bb7cc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2735386506", "DOI": "10.1111/gcbb.12474", "CorpusId": 91092145}, "title": "Woody biochar's greenhouse gas mitigation potential across fertilized and unfertilized agricultural soils and soil moisture regimes", "abstract": "Biochar has been widely researched as an important technology for climate smart agriculture, yet work is still necessary to identify the magnitude of potential greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation and mechanisms involved.

This research explored the magnitude of biochar's full GHG mitigation potential and drivers of such impacts.

The greatest GHG mitigation potential was from C sequestration and nitrous oxide (N2O) reduction in mineral N fertilized soils, with minimal impacts on N2O emissions in unfertilized soils, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and methane (CH4) uptake. Analysis of mineral N dynamics in the bulk soil and on biochar isolates indicated that neither biochar impacts on net mineralization and nitrification nor retention of ammonium ( NH4+ ) on biochar isolates could explain biochar's N2O reduction. Instead, biochar amendments exhibited consistent N2O emission reductions relative to the N2O emission in the control soil regardless of soil type and fertilization. Results across a soil moisture gradient suggest that woody biochar may aerate soils shifting redox conditions and subsequent N2O production.

In so doing, it facilitates a reconciliation of the apparently conflicting views of the impacts of agricultural productivity growth on global GHG emissions and environmental quality. As has been previously recognized, in the case of a global change in farm productivity, the critical condition for an innovation to lead to diminished land use is that the farm level demand for agricultural products is inelastic. However, in the more common case where the innovation is regional in nature, the necessary condition for a reduction in global land use and associated GHG emissions is more complex and depends on the relative yields, emissions efficiencies and supply conditions in the affected and unaffected regions. While innovations in agricultural are most common land-sparing at global scale, innovations in regions commanding a small share of global production, with relatively low yields, high land supply elasticities and low emissions efficiencies can lead to an increase in global land use change emissions. A numerical example illustrates these points and suggests that these conditions may hold for productivity shocks in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa.

Using an optofluidic ring resonator of extremely high Q-factors (>10(7)), we investigated the unique characteristics and underlying mechanism of chlorophyll lasers. Chlorophyll lasers with dual lasing bands at 680 nm and 730 nm were observed for the first time in isolated chlorophyll a (Chla). Particularly, a laser at the 730 nm band was realized in 0.1 mM Chla with a lasing threshold of only 8 \u03bcJ mm(-2). Additionally, we observed lasing competition between the two lasing bands. The presence of laser emission at the 680 nm band can lead to quenching or significant reduction of laser emission at the 730 nm band, effectively increasing the lasing threshold for the 730 nm band. Further concentration-dependent studies, along with theoretical analysis, elucidated the mechanism that determines when and why the laser emission band appears at one of the two bands, or concomitantly at both bands. Finally, Chla was exploited as the donor in fluorescence resonance energy transfer to extend the laser emission to the near infrared regime with an unprecedented wavelength shift as large as 380 nm.

The application of PCCC technology to reduce CO2 emissions at large point sources, such as fossil fuel-fired power plants is particularly promising. Amine-based scrubbing is the most mature PCCC technology, with 2-aminoethanol (MEA) the most widely utilized solvent. Despite the use of water wash systems to treat effluent, small amounts of the solvent and degradation products are present in amine-based PCCC plant emissions. Recently, concerns have arisen that emissions from PCCC plants could be harmful to human health and the environment. Of particular interest are nitrosamine and nitramine degradation products, many of which are known carcinogens. Degradation products, including nitrosamines and nitramines, will form in PCCC plants from reactions between the amine solvent and NOx species in the flue gas. For primary amine solvents (e.g., MEA), nitrosamines can only be formed indirectly from other degradation products. Solvents with secondary and tertiary amine functionalities (e.g., piperazine and N-methyldiethanolamine) can directly form stable nitrosamines. Nitramines can form directly from primary, secondary, or tertiary amines. However, there is currently limited emission data available for PCCC plants. This problem is compounded by the fact that emission composition and levels will depend significantly on the flue gas being processed, choice of solvent, and plant operation conditions. Emission levels in the range of 2\u221250 ng/Nm have been reported for both nitrosamines and nitramines at a pilot PCCC plant operating with MEA. These results, together with other reports of nitrosamines detected at pilot PCCC plants and in laboratory experiments, suggest low but quantifiable emissions of nitrosamines and nitramines. In addition to the formation of nitrosamines and nitramines within PCCC plants, it is also possible for these compounds to form through the atmospheric photooxidation of the amine solvent present in the emissions. Steady state conversion rates of amines to nitrosamines and nitramines have been reported for a variety of atmospheric conditions. Steady state nitrosamine yields for N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) were reported to be <0.6% of the amine concentration in a rural scenario and <2.3% in an urban scenario. Similar yields were reported for other nitrosamines and nitramines. The formation of nitrosamines and nitramines can therefore occur both in a PCCC plant and in the atmosphere. Relatively little is known about the potential impacts of PCCC-related emissions on human health and the environment. Compounds emitted from the plant or formed in the atmosphere will disperse and deposit to terrestrial and aquatic environments as either wet or dry aerosols. Preliminary studies have indicated that both nitrosamines and nitramines will partition preferentially to the water phase rather than adsorb to soils and sediments. It seems likely that these compounds will therefore reach an aqueous compartment (e.g., drinking water, groundwater). The biodegradability of nitrosamines and nitramines influences their potential for accumulation in aquatic matrices and ultimately their human and environmental exposure. Initial studies indicate biodegradation of nitrosamines and nitramines is complex, differing significantly between compounds and dependent upon environmental conditions and compound concentration. In general neither nitrosamines nor nitramines seem susceptible to rapid aerobic aqueous biodegradation indicating the possibility of accumulation in these environmental matrices. Owing to their hydrophilic nature, we do not expect nitrosamines and nitramines to bioaccumulate significantly in organisms; however, there seems to be potential for chronic exposure. To determine acceptable PCCC plant emission levels it is important to consider both the environmental fate of the emissions and the acceptable exposure levels. The Norwegian Public Health Institute (NPHI) has proposed acceptable exposure levels of 4 ng/L (drinking water) and 0.3 ng/m (air concentration) based on 10\u22126 lifetime risk of cancer following exposure to the nitrosamine, NDMA. The NPHI assessment assumes all nitrosamines and nitramines are as carcinogenic as NDMA, which is considered one of the most carcinogenic nitrosamines.

The GHGE intensities of 210 foods were calculated through life-cycle assessments and by using published data.

This study evaluates potential reductions in manufacturing and operating costs of redesigned emission aftertreatment systems of line-haul heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) with reduced engine-out emissions brought about by co-optimized fuel and engine technologies. Three emissions reduction cases representing conservative, medium, and optimistic engine-out emission reduction benefits are analyzed, compared to a reference case: the total costs of aftertreatment systems (TCA) of the three cases are reduced to $11,400(1.63 \u00a2/km), $9,100 (1.30 \u00a2/km), and $8,800 (1.26 \u00a2/km), respectively, compared to $12,000 (1.71 \u00a2/km) for the reference case.

We examined how a rise in atmospheric CO2 and temperature affected CH4 and N2O fluxes in a well\u2010drained upland soil (volumetric water content ranging between 6% and 23%) in a semiarid grassland during five growing seasons. We hypothesized that responses of CH4 and N2O fluxes to elevated CO2 and warming would be driven primarily by treatment effects on soil moisture. Previously we showed that elevated CO2 increased and warming decreased soil moisture in this grassland. We therefore expected that elevated CO2 and warming would have opposing effects on CH4 and N2O fluxes. Methane was taken up throughout the growing season in all 5 years. A bell\u2010shaped relationship was observed with soil moisture with highest CH4 uptake at intermediate soil moisture. Both N2O emission and uptake occurred at our site with some years showing cumulative N2O emission and other years showing cumulative N2O uptake. Nitrous oxide exchange switched from net uptake to net emission with increasing soil moisture. In contrast to our hypothesis, both elevated CO2 and warming reduced the sink of CH4 and N2O expressed in CO2 equivalents (across 5 years by 7% and 11% for elevated CO2 and warming respectively) suggesting that soil moisture changes were not solely responsible for this reduction.

Soil acidification induced by N addition decreased available P concentrations, and was associated with reductions in the relative abundance of phytase. The decreased relative abundance of bacteria and key functional gene groups for C degradation were related to slower SOC decomposition, indicating the key mechanisms driving SOC accumulation in the tropical forest soil subjected to High\u2010N addition. However, changes in microbial functional groups associated with N and P cycling led to coincidentally large increases in N2O emissions, and exacerbated soil P deficiency. These two factors partially offset the perceived beneficial effects of N addition on SOC storage in tropical forest soils.

In order to reduce further these emissions, the effect of hydrogen (H2: 20% energy share) on GHGs emissions in the biodiesel (B20) fueled diesel engine under dual fuel mode is assessed. CO2 emission decreased drastically with H2 due to higher thermal efficiency and lesser carbon content of the fuels than base diesel and B20 whereas CH4 and N2O emissions decreased significantly due to high temperature combustion.

Are building occupants \u2018addicted\u2019 to static environments, i.e. air-conditioning (AC)?

Results showed that the carbon emission of the construction industry is mainly affected by GDP growth of construction scale. The energy consumption was the main driver to the increase of carbon emissions. The carbon emissions of unit area and carbon intensity showed a decreased trend with the development of economy and the increase of construction scale. The dependence of construction activities on the fossil fuel remained despite noticeable decrease. Energy intensity helps to reduce construction carbon emissions.

A focused pulse of laser light was used to initiate a nucleus in the core of a vortex, allowing for the detailed examination of the growth, splitting and collapse of individual cavitation bubbles as they experience a reduction and recovery of the local static pressure. Images of single-bubble dynamics were captured with two pulse-synchronized high-speed video cameras. The shape and dynamics of single vortex cavitation bubbles are compared to the original vortex properties and the local static pressure in the vortex core, and an analysis was performed to understand the relationship between the non-cavitating vortex properties and the diameter of the elongated cavitation bubble. Acoustic emissions from the bubbles were detected during growing, splitting and collapse, revealing that the acoustic impulse created during collapse was four orders of magnitude higher than the noise emission due to growth and splitting. The dynamics and noise generation of the elongated bubbles are compared to that of spherical cavitation bubbles in quiescent flow. These data indicate that the core size and circulation are insufficient to scale the developed vortex cavitation. The non-cavitating vortex circulation and core size are not sufficient to scale the bubble dynamics, even though the single-phase pressure field is uniquely scaled by these parameters.

Emissions avoided by substituting fossil fuels with biofuels may be offset by emissions from direct and indirect land-use changes (LUC). There is an urgent need to investigate what impact land-use change emissions may have on the expansion of bioenergy and biofuels, in the context of EU mitigation policies. This paper focuses on Ireland, which faces a number of challenges in delivering its renewable energy and GHG reduction targets. The Irish TIMES energy systems model was used to assess the impact of a range of land-use change emissions\u2019 levels on the evolution of Ireland\u2019s low-carbon energy system. A reference scenario was developed where LUC is ignored and Ireland achieves a least-cost low-carbon energy system by 2050. If high indirect land-use change (ILUC) emissions are included, this results in a decrease by 30\u00a0% in bioenergy and a 68\u00a0% increase in marginal abatement costs by 2050. Hydrogen is used instead of bioenergy in the freight sector in this scenario, while private cars are fuelled by renewable electricity. If GHG emissions from ILUC were considered less severe, indigenous grass biomethane becomes the key biofuel representing 31\u00a0% of total bioenergy consumption.

In this study, the atmospheric compounds affecting the acidification in Finland have been investigated from different viewpoints. The geographical distribution, temporal trends and episodicity describe the regional and temporal variations, while the exposure and modelled values illustrate the impact of the different air transport directions or emission areas. In Finland, the SO 2 emissions and concentrations in the background areas have decreased by more than 80% since 1981. The reductions of sulphate concentrations in air and precipitation have been lower due to the dominance of the long range transport. The gas phase and particulate nitrogen compounds showed few significant trends in the 1990's. A steep decline in the atmospheric base cation deposition was discovered especially in the southeastern part of the country. From the Finnish perspective, the emissions of SO 2 are largest in the countries to the south as well as to the southwest and west of Finland. The frequent transport from these sectors together with the lower SO 2 emission reductions, especially in the southern sector, have contributed to the lower reductions in the sulphate concentrations. The highest sulphur dioxide and particulate sulphate concentrations in southern and central Finland originate from the sectors between south and east, while the transport is most frequent from the western sectors. Thus, the atmospheric sulphur exposure is highly affected by transport with the cleaner westerly winds, although the highest concentrations also have a remarkable effect on the mean concentration level. In the north, the transport from northeastern and northern sectors is also important for the exposure. From the Finnish perspective, the nitrogen oxide emissions are highest in the countries in the southwestern and western sectors.

The impact of ship emissions on tropospheric oxidants is mainly caused by the relatively large fraction of NOx in ship exhaust. Typical increases in yearly average surface ozone concentrations in the most impacted areas are 0.5-2.5 ppbv. The global annual mean radiative forcing due to ozone increases in the troposphere is 10 mWm(-2) over the period 2000-2007. We find global average tropospheric OH increase of 1.03% over the same period. As a result of this the global average tropospheric methane concentration is reduced by approximately 2.2% over a period corresponding to the turnover time. The resulting methane radiative forcing is -14 mWm(-2) with an additional contribution of -6 mWm(-2) from methane induced reduction in ozone. The net forcing of the ozone and methane changes due to ship emissions changes between 2000 and 2007 is -10 mWm(-2). This is significant compared to the net forcing of these components in 2000.

Such sheared chains exhibited an emission probability many times higher than the nonsheared chains within a nondewetted film. This increase in emission probability was accompanied by the emergence of an additional blue-shifted emission peak, suggesting reductions in conjugation length induced by the dewetting-driven mass redistribution.

In this study, we conducted numerical experiments with an up-todate regional chemical transport model to assess the contribution of the changes in meteorological conditions and anthropogenic emissions to the summer ozone level from 2013 to 2017 in various regions of China. The model can faithfully reproduce the observed meteorological parameters and air pollutant concentrations and capture the increasing trend in the surface maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) ozone (O3) from 2013 to 2017. The emission-control measures implemented by the government induced a decrease in MDA8 O3 levels in rural areas but an increase in urban areas. The meteorological influence on the ozone trend varied by region and by year and could be comparable to or even more significant than the impact of changes in anthropogenic emissions. Meteorological conditions can modulate the ozone concentration via direct (e.g., increasing reaction rates at higher temperatures) and indirect (e.g., increasing biogenic emissions at higher temperatures) effects. As an essential source of volatile organic compounds that contributes to ozone formation, the variation in biogenic emissions during summer varied across regions and was mainly affected by temperature. China\u2019s midlatitude areas (25 to 40 N) experienced a significant decrease in MDA8 O3 due to a decline in biogenic emissions, especially for the Yangtze River Delta and Sichuan Basin regions in 2014 and 2015. In contrast, in northern (north of 40 N) and southern (south of 25 N) China, higher temperatures after 2013 led to an increase in MDA8 O3 via an increase in biogenic emissions. We also assessed the individual effects of changes in temperature, specific humidity, wind field, planetary boundary layer height, clouds, and precipitation on ozone levels from 2013 to 2017. The results show that the wind field change made a significant contribution to the increase in surface ozone over many parts of China.

Measurement of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) mass is performed using a dried, 30 \u00b0C tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM). TEOM measurements are complemented by observations of light scattering by nephelometry. Measurements of major constituents include: (1) SO4 2\u2212 via reduction to SO2; (2) NH4 + and NO3 \u2212 via respective catalytic oxidation and reduction to NO, (3) black carbon (BC) by optical absorption, (4) total carbon by combustion to CO2, and (5) organic carbon by difference between the latter two measurements. Several illustrative examples of continuous data from the SEARCH network are presented. A distinctive composite annual average diurnal pattern is observed for PM2.5 mass, nitrate, and BC, likely indicating the influence of traffic-related emissions, growth, and break up of the boundary layer and formation of ammonium nitrate.

In this study we examined how mitigation through the reduction of the intensity of land management and through rewetting may affect the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and the C balance of intensively managed, drained, agricultural peatlands. Carbon and GHG balances were determined for three peatlands in the western part of the Netherlands from 2005 to 2008 by considering spatial and temporal variability of emissions (CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O). One area (Oukoop) is an intensively managed grass-on-peatland area, including a dairy farm, with the ground water level at an average annual depth of 0.55 (\u00b10.37) m below the soil surface. The second area (Stein) is an extensively managed grass-on-peatland area, formerly intensively managed, with a dynamic ground water level at an average annual depth of 0.45 (\u00b10.35) m below the soil surface. The third area is a (since 1998) rewetted former agricultural peatland (Horstermeer), close to Oukoop and Stein, with the average annual ground water level at a depth of 0.2 (\u00b10.20) m below the soil surface. During the measurement campaigns we found that both agriculturally managed sites acted as C and GHG sources and the rewetted former agricultural peatland acted as a C and GHG sink. The ecosystem (fields and ditches) total GHG balance, including CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O, amounted to 3.9 (\u00b10.4), 1.3 (\u00b10.5) and \u22121.7 (\u00b11.8) g CO 2 -eq m \u22122 d \u22121 for Oukoop, Stein and Horstermeer, respectively. Adding the farm-based emissions to Oukoop and Stein resulted in a total GHG emission of 8.3 (\u00b11.0) and 6.6 (\u00b11.3) g CO 2 -eq m \u22122 d \u22121 , respectively. For Horstermeer the GHG balance remained the same since no farm-based emissions exist. Considering the C balance (uncertainty range 40\u201360%), the total C release in Oukoop and Stein is 5270 and 6258 kg C ha \u22121 yr \u22121 , respectively (including ecosystem and management fluxes), and the total C uptake in Horstermeer is 3538 kg C ha \u22121 yr \u22121 . Water bodies contributed significantly to the terrestrial GHG balance because of a high release of CH 4 . Overall, this study suggests that managed peatlands are large sources of GHGs and C, but, if appropriate measures are taken, they can be turned back into GHG and C sinks within 15 years of abandonment and rewetting. The shift from an intensively managed grass-on-peat area (Oukoop) to an extensively managed one (Stein) reduced the GHG emissions mainly because N 2 O emission and farm-based CH 4 emissions decreased.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "8fb7f76dfac166e55913b02bef6c5d07d5194550", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2300728138", "CorpusId": 53652489}, "title": "The carbon footprint of UK Cities: 4M: measurement, modelling, mapping and measurement", "abstract": "Introduction The planet is threatened by the emission of human-made greenhouse gasses, and in particular carbon dioxide (CO 2) from the combustion of fossil fuels. In 2009, average annual CO 2 emissions were 4.1 t CO 2 per person worldwide, although in developed countries this was substantially higher at 11.5 t CO 2 per person (IEA, 2009). Atmospheric CO 2 concentration has reached 380 ppm globally, with levels increasing by 1.9 ppm annually between 1995 and 2005 (IPCC, 2007). The world's population currently stands at 6.8 billion and is set to rise to c.8 billion by 2050 (PRB, 2009). In 2008, for the first time, over half of all people lived in cities and by 2030 this is expected to rise to nearly two-thirds (UNFPA, 2007). The high density of people in cities, who use energy for transport, food, and consumer goods and services, make them major contributors to global greenhouse gas emissions. The need to reduce CO 2 emissions from cities is clear. International negotiations to curb emissions have had mixed outcomes, but notwithstanding, national and sub-national initiatives proliferate. Policies and economic instruments to cut CO 2 emissions need to operate in a manner that preserves, or even enhances, cities' functioning and environment. Transport emissions have to be curbed without impinging on necessary travel, building energy use needs to be controlled without rendering them inoperable , and emission reduction practices need to impact as little as possible on key ecosystem services 1. Importantly, emissions reduction in all of these areas can go hand-in-hand with improvements to lifestyles and well-being: reduced traffic improves air quality and therefore human health, more energy efficient buildings lower fuel costs to occupants , and green spaces can sequester carbon whilst improving the aesthetic environment and human health and well-being. Thus, a low carbon city can be a cleaner, quieter, healthier and more enjoyable city. The 4M project is examining these issues by estimating key components of the carbon footprint (Wiedmann & Minx, 2008) of the city of Leicester in the UK. The project adopts a multi-disciplinary perspective and is being progressed through collaboration between researchers from five UK universities and Leicester City Council. This enables a rounded view of proposed carbon reduction initiatives to be evaluated in the real social and economic context of a functioning and dynamic city.

Here, we report the interference by a phloem-feeding insect, the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, with indirect plant defenses induced by spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) in Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus) plants. Additional whitefly infestation of spider-mite infested plants resulted in a reduced attraction of predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis) compared to attraction to plants infested by spider mites only. This interference is shown to result from the reduction in (E)-\u03b2-ocimene emission from plants infested by both spider mites and whiteflies. When using exogenous salicylic acid (SA) application to mimic B. tabaci infestation, we observed similar results in behavioral and chemical analyses. Phytohormone and gene-expression analyses revealed that B. tabaci infestation, as well as SA application, inhibited spider mite-induced jasmonic acid (JA) production and reduced the expression of two JA-regulated genes, one of which encodes for the P. lunatus enzyme \u03b2-ocimene synthase that catalyzes the synthesis of (E)-\u03b2-ocimene.

Five patients presented with variably progressed CQ retinopathy (10\u201322 years of treatment) and abnormalities in all tests. In the mildest case, pericentral reduction in mfERG amplitudes corresponded to increased pericentral FAF, reduced pericentral NIA and pericentral interruption of the photoreceptor inner/outer segment junction in the sdOCT. In all sdOCT scans, the outer nuclear layer thickness was reduced. More severe cases showed preserved subfoveal photoreceptors and function with marked changes in all examinations towards the periphery.

Rather, future use of fossil fuels will likely be limited by controls on the emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere that are agreed to by the nations of the world. The increase in atmospheric CO2 over the past 200 years, mainly from fossil fuel combustion, is confidently thought to have increased global temperatures and induced other changes in Earth's climate, with the prospect of much more severe consequences from projected future emissions. Limiting such changes in Earth's climate would place major constraints on the combustion of fossil fuels and/or the emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. Developing effective and cost-effective strategies for limiting CO2 emissions requires the confident ability to project the changes in climate that would result from a given increase in atmospheric CO2. However, even the change in global mean surface temperature (GMST), the single most important index of climate change, that would result from a given increase in atmospheric CO2 remains uncertain to a factor of 2 or more, largely because of uncertainty in Earth's climate sensitivity, the change in GMST per change in radiative flux. This uncertainty in climate sensitivity, which gives rise to a comparable uncertainty in the shared global resource of the amount of fossil fuel that can be burned consonant with a given increase in global mean surface temperature, greatly limits the ability to effectively formulate strategies to limit climate change while meeting the world's future energy requirements. Key limits on determining climate sensitivity are the small change in downwelling longwave irradiance, less than one percent, that would give rise to changes in climate that reach the level of concern, the complexity of cloud processes and the difficulty of representing them in climate models, and limited understanding of the processes that control the radiative influences of atmospheric aerosols. A recent empirical calculation of Earth's climate sensitivity as the quotient of the relaxation time constant of GMST upon the effective heat capacity characterizing climate change on the multidecadal time scale points to a possible alternative approach to determining Earth's climate sensitivity. While improved knowledge of Earth's climate sensitivity is essential to development of optimal energy strategies, even for climate sensitivity at the low end of the range of present estimates, substantial reductions in CO2 emissions from their present values would be required to avert dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system that would otherwise occur well before the end of the present century.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "075f27e13491d2d25fc972147a71ef2179f981d7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2028968700", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENCONMAN.2013.12.056", "CorpusId": 96333672}, "title": "Reduction of harmful emissions from a diesel engine fueled by kapok methyl ester using combined coating and SNCR technology.", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "7d6657ad1a1398555110d02bba94f844160ec1e6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2115395296", "DOI": "10.1016/J.RESCONREC.2013.04.002", "CorpusId": 110866203}, "title": "The potential contribution of sustainable waste management to energy use and greenhouse gas emission reduction in the Netherlands", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "afd4342e98bc6e9425612b86ad2ed20082e952b9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1974809141", "DOI": "10.1080/15568310601113769", "CorpusId": 55185629}, "title": "An Exploration of Household Response to Personal Travel Carbon-Reduction Targets", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Transport is currently responsible for around one-quarter of the total anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the United Kingdom, and this proportion is projected to increase. The transport sector will undoubtedly need to play a significant role in achieving carbon reductions if the government is to meet its ambitious long-term goal of a 60% reduction by 2050. This article examines current carbon use by households for personal land-based transport and considers how feasible it would be to change that use over the period up to 2050 in the United Kingdom. It provides a unique insight into how much and in what way households and individuals may be willing to adapt their transport behavior to achieve carbon reductions. A computer-based transport carbon calculator was developed to investigate the CO2 emissions of individual households from various modes based on travel diary information. This formed the focus of a series of interactive interviews in which participants were asked to consider how their future low carbon transport strategy could look. Views of households on various abatement measures were explored, including technological change in vehicle design or fuel source and behavioral change through, for instance, traffic restraint and investment in public transport. Overall, a 40% reduction in carbon emissions was seen to be feasible through a combination of behavioral change measures and a realistically achievable degree of technological improvement, falling well short of the UK government's goal of a 60% reduction. Through changes in behavior alone, the households involved could only achieve around a 20% cut in carbon emissions \u2014seemingly a threshold beyond which further reductions will be difficult and may necessitate significant lifestyle change.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "8f397fae2c4b95d51a59e8c6169e7bdbe899f134", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1971176768", "DOI": "10.1021/ES0717156", "CorpusId": 44473472, "PubMed": "18350907"}, "title": "Using oily wastewater emulsified fuel in boiler: energy saving and reduction of air pollutant emissions.", "abstract": "The limited data for using emulsified oil have demonstrated its effectiveness in reducing flue gas pollutant emissions. The presence of a high concentration of toxic organic compounds in industrial wastewaters always presents significant problems. Therefore, this study was undertaken by using wastewater with COD of 9600 mg/L and total petroleum hydrocarbons-gasoline 440 mg/L for making an emulsified oil (wastewater content 20% with 0.1% surfactant) to evaluate the extent of reductions in both criteria pollutants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For comparison, two other systems (heavy oil fuel and water-emulsified oil) were also conducted. The wastewater-emulsified oil fuel results in significant reductions in particulate matter (PM), NO(x), SO2, and CO as compared to heavy oil fuel and similar to those from water/oil emulsified fuel; for PM, it is better in wastewater-emulsified oil. The reductions of total PAH flue gas emissions are 38 and 30% for wastewater- and water-emulsified fuel, respectively; they are 63 and 44% for total BaP(eq), respectively. In addition to reducing flue gas pollutant emissions, the results also demonstrate that the use of wastewater-emulsified fuel in boiler operation provides several advantages: (1) safe disposal of industrial wastewater; and (2) energy savings of about 13%.

However, even if climate is stabilised at current atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, those warming targets would almost certainly be surpassed in the context of mean temperature increases over land only. The reason for this is two-fold. First, current transient warming lags significantly below equilibrium or \u201ccommitted\u201d warming. Second, almost all climate models indicate warming rates over land are much higher than those for the oceans. We demonstrate this potential for high eventual temperatures over land, even for contemporary GHG levels, using a large set of climate models and for which climate sensitivities are known. Such additional land warming has implications for impacts on terrestrial ecosystems and human well-being.

Basically, NOx abatement of any significance requires means of reducing the peak flame temperatures within the combustor. To obtain these flame temperature reductions, while also maintaining acceptable combustor performance and operability at low engine power conditions, combustion process staging methods are needed. For use in advanced subsonic aircraft engines, combustors with leaner primary combustion zone fuel/air mixtures, together with combustion process staging features, are being developed. Significant NOx level reductions have been demonstrated with these advanced combustor design concepts. Although the resulting combustors are more complex than current technology combustors, satisfactory performance and operability appear attainable with these configurations. The initial introduction of these combustors into operational engines during the latter part of this decade is a likely prospect. In the case of advanced supersonic transport aircraft engines, combustors with ultralow NOx levels will probably be needed to prevent adverse impacts on the stratospheric ozone layer.

In this study we assess the effects of a 7-week (23 March\u201310 May 2020) lockdown in the Greater Area of Athens, coupling in situ observations with estimations from a meteorology-atmospheric chemistry model. Measurements in central Athens during the lockdown were compared with levels during the pre- and post-lockdown 3-week periods and with respective levels in the four previous years. We examined regulatory pollutants as well as CO2, black carbon (BC) and source-specific BC components. Models were run for pre-lockdown and lockdown periods, under baseline and reduced-emissions scenarios. The in-situ results indicate mean concentration reductions of 30\u201335% for traffic-related pollutants in Athens (NO2, CO, BC from fossil fuel combustion), compared to the pre-lockdown period. A large reduction (53%) was observed also for the urban CO2 enhancement while the reduction for PM2.5 was subtler (18%). Significant reductions were also observed when comparing the 2020 lockdown period with past years. However, levels rebounded immediately following the lift of the general lockdown. The decrease in measured NO2 concentrations was reproduced by the implementation of the city scale model, under a realistic reduced-emissions scenario for the lockdown period, anchored at a 46% decline of road transport activity. The model permitted the assessment of air quality improvements on a spatial scale, indicating that NO2 mean concentration reductions in areas of the Athens basin reached up to 50%.

Achieving such a goal will entail a rapid transition away from reliance on petroleum for transportation and high carbon fuels for electricity generation towards alternative transportation fuels and low-carbon electrical generating technologies, including solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Even with adoption rates for these technologies that are all near or even beyond the limits of plausibility, it will be impossible to achieve the desired emission reductions while simultaneously maintaining reasonable economic growth unless, in addition, the energy efficiency of the economy improves at a rate significantly above the historical trend.

Lester and Finan, \u201cThe Impact of Carbon Emission Reduction Targets\u201d July 2009 2 Introduction This paper examines the implications for the U.S. energy infrastructure of the targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions now being actively considered by the U.S. government. The Waxman-Markey legislation recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives calls for U.S. carbon emissions to decline 83% from their level in 2005 by 2050. At various times President Obama has similarly called for emission reductions of over 80% by mid-century, and in July the President agreed with the other G8 leaders that the developed countries, including the U.S., should reduce their emissions 80% by 2050. These targets are loosely derived from integrated scientific and economic assessments of the consequences for the earth\u2019s climate of elevated atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. The problem of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions will affect all countries. Here we examine what would be required for the U.S. to achieve reductions in this general range. It is widely recognized that an effective strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions must focus on the energy sector, whose releases of carbon dioxide account for 80% of all U.S. anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. There are two essential elements of a strategy for reducing energy-related carbon emissions: first, improving the efficiency of energy use (energy productivity) or, equivalently, reducing the \u2018energy intensity\u2019 of the economy; and second, \u2018decarbonizing\u2019 the nation\u2019s energy supply infrastructure \u2013 that is, reducing the carbon intensity of the energy system by moving away from primary reliance on petroleum for transportation and high carbon fuels for electricity generation towards alternative transportation fuels and low or zero-carbon electrical generating technologies. It is evident that these two elements of an overall strategy are interdependent. The more rapid the transition to low carbon energy supplies, the less we will need to rely on energy end-use efficiency gains to achieve a given emission reduction target, and vice versa. There is in fact a fixed relationship between the two if a target for economic output is specified together with the carbon reduction goal. The relationship between these four factors \u2013 carbon 1 H.R. 2454: American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, Section 702 2 Climate change avoidance strategies must also reduce emissions of potent non-carbon greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide.
