This study examined household emission reduction by switching from unprocessed bituminous and anthracite coals to processed semi-coke briquettes. Two typical stoves were used to test emission characteristics when burning 20 raw coal samples commonly used in residential heating activities and 15 semi-coke briquette samples which were made from bituminous coals by industrial carbonization treatment. The carbonization treatment removes volatile compounds from raw coals which are the major precursors for PM formation and carbon emission. The average emission factors of primary PM2.5, elemental carbon, organic carbon, and carbon monoxide for the tested semi-coke briquettes are much lower than those of the tested raw coals. Based on the current coal consumption data in China, switching to semi-coke briquettes can reduce average emission factors of these species by about 92%, 98%, 91%, and 34%, respectively. Additionally, semi-coke briquette has relatively lower price and higher burnout ratio.

GHG emissions related to insulation production and fugitive releases of blowing agents are modeled and compared with GHG savings from reduced heating loads in North America, Europe, and Asia.

These constituents react with hydrogen oxide radicals (OH\u2009+\u2009HO2\u2009=\u2009HOx) in the presence of sunlight and heat to produce O3. The question of whether to reduce NOx emissions, VOC emissions, or both is complicated by spatially and temporally heterogeneous ozone\u2010NOx\u2010VOC sensitivity. This study characterizes spatial and temporal variations in O3 sensitivity by analyzing the ratio of formaldehyde (HCHO, a marker of VOCs) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a metric known as the formaldehyde nitrogen ratio (FNR). Level 3 gridded retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard the NASA Aura satellite were used to calculate FNR, with our analysis focusing on China. Based on previous studies, we take FNR\u2009<\u20091.0 as indicating VOC\u2010limited regimes, FNR\u2009>\u20092.0 as indicating NOx\u2010limited regime, and FNR between 1.0 and 2.0 as indicating transitional regime (where either NOx reductions or VOC reductions would be expected to reduce O3). We find that the transitional regime is widespread over the North China Plain (NCP), the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta during the ozone season (defined as having near\u2010surface air temperatures >20\u00b0C at the early afternoon OMI overpass time). Outside of these regions, the NOx\u2010limited regime is dominant. Because HCHO and NO2 have distinct seasonal patterns, FNR also has a pronounced seasonality, consistent with the seasonal cycle of surface O3. Examining trends from 2005 to 2013 indicates rapid growth in NO2, especially over less\u2010developed areas where O3 photochemistry is NOx limited. Over this time period, HCHO decreased in southern China, where VOC emissions are dominated by biogenic sources, but increased slightly over the NCP, where VOC emissions are dominated by anthropogenic sources. A linear regression approach suggests that most of China (70% of grid cells) will be characterized by a transitional regime during the O3 season by 2030. However, in megacities such as Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Beijing, NO2 has decreased such that the chemical regime has shifted from VOC limited in 2005 to transitional in 2013.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "1b104d40c06f3c24cc2dc0b5794072248c6eb251", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2161550703", "CorpusId": 13857641}, "title": "THE SECONDARY ELECTRON YIELD OF TECHNICAL MATERIALS AND ITS VARIATION WITH SURFACE TREATMENTS", "abstract": "Secondary electron emission of surfaces exposed to oscillating electromagnetic field is at the origin of the multipacting effect that could severely perturb the operation of particle accelerators.

We track households for up to four years after they received the stove. While we find a meaningful reduction in smoke inhalation in the first year, there is no effect over longer time horizons. We find no evidence of improvements in lung functioning or health and there is no change in fuel consumption (and presumably greenhouse gas emissions). The difference between the laboratory and field findings appear to result from households' revealed low valuation of the stoves. Households failed to use the stoves regularly or appropriately, did not make the necessary investments to maintain them properly, and usage rates ultimately declined further over time.

The effects of pilot injection timing, intake charge pressure, and charge temperature on engine performance and emissions with natural gas fueling were studied. With appropriate control of the above variables, it was shown that full-load engine-out brake specific NO X emissions could be reduced to the range of 0.07-0.10 g/kWh from the baseline diesel (with mechanical fuel injection) value of 10.5 g/kWh. For this NO X reduction, the decrease in fuel conversion efficiency from the baseline diesel value was approximately one to two percentage points.

Emission of NH3 is reduced most effectively when dietary changes result in a reduction of urinary urea concentration. The objective of this research was to predict NH3 emission from dairy barns for various diets, using feed characteristics, and climate, barn, and slurry related parameters. Model results were validated using experimental data. Cows were fed one of nine diets, which was a combination of three rumen degradable protein balances and one of three roughage compositions. Each diet was repeated once. Measured parameters included herd, diet, urine, slurry, barn and climate characteristics, and emission of NH3 from the barn. For a wide range of diets and barn conditions, observed NH3 emission from a dairy barn can be predicted accurately using a combination of existing nutrition-emission models. Accuracy of prediction improved considerably, however, when observed emissions during four diet treatments were omitted due to suspected technical failure of the emission measurement equipment. Results also show that NH3 emissions in common practical situations will range from about 3.3 to 16.3 kg per cow per 190 d. To reduce NH3 emission in practice, farmers should maximize the diet's grass content, and at the same time, minimize its rumen degradable protein balance level.

The former is supported by the AOD change detected by MODIS and MISR sensors, while the latter is likely the case for NOx and NH3 emissions because no evidence shows that their atmospheric concentration has declined over China.

First, we estimate the elasticity of carbon emissions with respect to population and income per capita in an unbalanced yearly panel of cross-country data from 1950\u20132010. We demonstrate that the elasticity with respect to population is nearly seven times larger than the elasticity with respect to income per capita and that this difference is statistically significant.

For all cases evaluated, only soybean in GuarantA\u00a3 do Norte and Alta Floresta, Brazil needed less than one human generation (30 years) to repay the initial carbon debt. Highest repayment times were found for Jatropha (76-310 years) and oil palm (59-220 years) case studies. Oil palm established in peatlands had the greatest repayment times (206-220 years). High repayment times for Jatropha resulted from the combined effects of land-cover change and low CO 2 emission reduction rate. These outcomes raise serious questions about the sustainability of biofuel production. The carbon implications of conversion of (semi-)natural systems with medium to high biomass indicate that, in order to generate climate benefits, cultivation of biofuel feedstocks should be restricted to areas that already have low carbon content. \u00c2\u00a9 2011 by the author(s).", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "caa92f7c0190d183421c0f06a62db63f3975d2c5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2921299678", "DOI": "10.1016/J.RENENE.2019.03.078", "CorpusId": 115365039}, "title": "Emission reduction in a DI diesel engine using exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) of palm biodiesel blended with TiO2 nano additives", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "fce03ad89ad098cbf77456b468e58b5a7969a3eb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2227974961", "DOI": "10.1038/nature16455", "CorpusId": 4470588, "PubMed": "26738592"}, "title": "Partially oxidized atomic cobalt layers for carbon dioxide electroreduction to liquid fuel", "abstract": "Electroreduction of CO2 into useful fuels, especially if driven by renewable energy, represents a potentially \u2018clean\u2019 strategy for replacing fossil feedstocks and dealing with increasing CO2 emissions and their adverse effects on climate. The critical bottleneck lies in activating CO2 into the CO2\u2022\u2212 radical anion or other intermediates that can be converted further, as the activation usually requires impractically high overpotentials. Recently, electrocatalysts based on oxide-derived metal nanostructures have been shown to enable CO2 reduction at low overpotentials. However, it remains unclear how the electrocatalytic activity of these metals is influenced by their native oxides, mainly because microstructural features such as interfaces and defects influence CO2 reduction activity yet are difficult to control. To evaluate the role of the two different catalytic sites, here we fabricate two kinds of four-atom-thick layers: pure cobalt metal, and co-existing domains of cobalt metal and cobalt oxide. Cobalt mainly produces formate (HCOO\u2212) during CO2 electroreduction; we find that surface cobalt atoms of the atomically thin layers have higher intrinsic activity and selectivity towards formate production, at lower overpotentials, than do surface cobalt atoms on bulk samples. Partial oxidation of the atomic layers further increases their intrinsic activity, allowing us to realize stable current densities of about 10 milliamperes per square centimetre over 40 hours, with approximately 90 per cent formate selectivity at an overpotential of only 0.24 volts, which outperforms previously reported metal or metal oxide electrodes evaluated under comparable conditions. The correct morphology and oxidation state can thus transform a material from one considered nearly non-catalytic for the CO2 electroreduction reaction into an active catalyst. These findings point to new opportunities for manipulating and improving the CO2 electroreduction properties of metal systems, especially once the influence of both the atomic-scale structure and the presence of oxide are mechanistically better understood.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "df8dbaf8a775b1ae04c2c32240d360842dc2c7a1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1484419464", "PubMedCentral": "3155279", "DOI": "10.1021/es104227y", "CorpusId": 8626282, "PubMed": "21761880"}, "title": "Contribution of Anaerobic Digesters to Emissions Mitigation and Electricity Generation Under U.S. Climate Policy", "abstract": "Livestock husbandry in the U.S. significantly contributes to many environmental problems, including the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG).

Present day tropospheric ozone and its changes between 1850 and 2100 are considered, analysing 15 global models that participated in the Atmospheric Chemistry and Climate Model Intercomparison Project (ACCMIP). The ensemble mean compares well against present day observations. The seasonal cycle correlates well, except for some locations in the tropical upper troposphere. Most (75 %) of the models are encompassed with a range of global mean tropospheric ozone column estimates from satellite data, but there is a suggestion of a high bias in the Northern Hemisphere and a low bias in the Southern Hemisphere, which could indicate deficiencies with the ozone precursor emissions. Compared to the present day ensemble mean tropospheric ozone burden of 337 \u00b1 23 Tg, the ensemble mean burden for 1850 time slice is ~30% lower. Future changes were modelled using emissions and climate projections from four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Compared to 2000, the relative changes in the ensemble mean tropospheric ozone burden in 2030 (2100) for the different RCPs are: \u22124% (\u221216%) for RCP2.6, 2% (\u22127%) for RCP4.5, 1% (\u22129%) for RCP6.0, and 7% (18%) for RCP8.5. Model agreement on the magnitude of the change is greatest for larger changes. Reductions in most precursor emissions are common across the RCPs and drive ozone decreases in all but RCP8.5, where doubled methane and a 40\u2013150% greater stratospheric influx (estimated from a subset of models) increase ozone. While models with a high ozone burden for the present day also have high ozone burdens for the other time slices, no model consistently predicts large or small ozone changes; i.e. the magnitudes of the burdens and burden changes do not appear to be related simply, and the models are sensitive to emissions and climate changes in different ways. Spatial patterns of ozone changes are well correlated across most models, but are notably different for models without time evolving stratospheric ozone concentrations.

Lakes in the Atlantic provinces, Quebec and Ontario affected only by long-range sources show a general decline in sulfate (SO42\u2212) concentrations, but with a relatively smaller compensating increase in pH or alkalinity. Several factors may contribute to the constrained (or most likely delayed) acidity response: declining base cation concentrations, drought-induced mobilization of SO42\u2212, damaged internal alkalinity generation mechanisms, and perhaps increasing nitrate or organic anion levels. Monitoring to detect biological recovery in southeastern Canada is extremely limited, but where it occurs, there is little evidence of recovery outside of the Sudbury/Killarney area. Both the occurrence of Atlantic salmon in Nova Scotia rivers and the breeding success of Common Loons in Ontario lakes are in fact declining although factors beyond acidification also play a role.

It was originally proposed that the observed minimum of \u03b413C\u2010CH4 prior to the start of industrialization is caused by a large shift in biomass burning emissions between 1400 and 1700 A.D. According to our new hypothesis, however, the \u03b413C\u2010CH4 minimum is the first sign of the global rise of anthropogenic CH4 emissions. The main idea is that emissions of isotopically depleted CH4, from, for example, rice cultivation, domestic ruminants, and waste treatment started increasing earlier than the isotopically enriched emissions from fossil fuel, which started with the start of industrialization. However, because the observed increase of atmospheric methane only started around 1750 A.D., these preindustrial anthropogenic emissions must have been accompanied by a net reduction of natural CH4 sources during the Little Ice Age (LIA) compensating for the increase of anthropogenic emissions during that period. Results of transient box model simulations for the last millennium show that under the new hypothesis a close agreement can be obtained between model and measurements. Prior to 1400 A.D., low emissions from anthropogenic biomass burning require a sizable contribution of methane emissions from vegetation to explain the observed high level of \u03b413C\u2010CH4.

The remote sensing mean gram per kilogram carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbon (HC), and oxide of nitrogen (NOx) measurements are 8.9% lower, 41% higher, and 24% higher than the tunnel measurements, respectively. The remote sensing CO/NOx and HC/NOx mass ratios are 28% lower and 20% higher than the comparable tunnel ratios. Comparisons with the historical tunnel measurements show large reductions in CO, HC, and NOx over the past 23 yr, but little change in the HC/NOx mass ratio since 1995. The fleet CO and HC emissions are increasingly dominated by a few gross emitters, with more than a third of the total emissions being contributed by less than 1% of the fleet. An example of this is a 1995 vehicle measured three times with an average HC emission of 419 g/kg fuel (two-stroke snowmobiles average 475 g/kg fuel), responsible for 4% of the total HC emissions. The 2008 economic downturn dramatically reduced the number of new vehicles entering the fleet, leading to an age increase (>1 model year) of the Sherman Way fleet that has increased the fleet's ammonia (NH3) emissions. The mean NH3 levels appear little changed from previous measurements collected in the Van Nuys tunnel in 1993. Comparisons between weekday and weekend data show few fleet differences, although the fraction of light-duty diesel vehicles decreased from the weekday (1.7%) to Saturday (1.2%) and Sunday (0.6%). Implications: On-road remote sensing emission measurements of light-duty vehicles on Sherman Way in Van Nuys, California, show large historical emission reductions for CO and HC emissions despite an older fleet arising from the 2008 economic downturn. Fleet CO and HC emissions are increasingly dominated by a few gross emitters, with a single 1995 vehicle measured being responsible for 4% of the entire fleet's HC emissions. Finding and repairing and/or scrapping as little as 2% of the fleet would reduce on-road tailpipe emissions by as much as 50%.

Food waste can be reduced by various activities including preventing edible food loss, draining moisture, and home composting. These activities have different potentials for greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction. Therefore, we conducted a life-cycle inventory analysis of household waste management scenarios for Kyoto with a special emphasis on food waste reduction activities.MethodsThe primary functional unit of our study was \u201cannual management of household combustible waste in Kyoto, Japan.\u201d Although some life-cycle assessment scenarios included food waste reduction measures, all of the scenarios had an identical secondary functional unit, \u201cannual food ingestion (mass and composition) by the residents of Kyoto, Japan.\u201d We analyzed a typical incineration scenario (Inc) and two anaerobic digestion (dry thermophilic facilities) scenarios involving either source-separated collection (SepBio) or nonseparated collection followed by mechanical sorting (MecBio). We assumed that the biogas from anaerobic digestion was used for power generation. In addition, to evaluate the effects of waste reduction combined with separate collection, three food waste reduction cases were considered in the SepBio scenario: (1) preventing loss of edible food (PrevLoss); (2) draining moisture contents (ReducDrain); and (3) home composting (ReducHcom). In these three cases, we assumed that the household waste was reduced by 5%.Results and discussionThe GHG emissions from the Inc, MecBio, and SepBio scenarios were 123.3, 119.5, and 118.6 Gg CO2-eq/year, respectively. Compared with the SepBio scenario without food waste reduction, the PrevLoss and ReducDrain cases reduced the GHG emissions by 17.1 and 0.5 Gg CO2-eq/year. In contrast, the ReducHcom case increased the GHG emissions by 2.1 Gg CO2-eq/year. This is because the biogas power production decreased due to the reduction in food waste, while the electricity consumption increased in response to home composting. Sensitivity analyses revealed that a reduction of only 1% of the household waste by food loss prevention has the same GHG reduction effect as a 31-point increase (from 50% to 81%) in the food waste separation rate.ConclusionsWe found that prevention of food losses enhanced by separate collection led to a significant reduction in GHG emissions.

This approach is based on the use of a mixed fuel where an additive or a low boiling point fuel such as CO2, gas fuel, or gasoline is mixed with a higher boiling point fuel such as diesel gas oil. When producing such a fuel, the vapour\u2014liquid equilibrium in the two-phase region where the liquid and vapour phases of both components coexist is taken into account. In designing a mixed fuel, the authors intend to control both the physical process in the spray such as fuel evaporation and vapour air mixing and the chemical processes including spontaneous ignition and with reactions with regard to NO x , particulate matter (PM), and hydrocarbon (HC) formation. In this study flash boiling of mixed fuel is particularly focused on enhancing the mixing process in the spray because it has the potential to achieve fast evaporation and relatively lean and homogeneous mixtures. Experiments were carried out using two types of mixed fuel, both of which can generate flash boiling during injection events. In an experiment using a rapid compression machine (RCM) and an optical engine, mixed fuels consisting of liquefied CO2 as an additive and n-tridecane representing gas oil were employed with the aim of simultaneously reducting soot and NO x emissions. The high-speed images acquired for sprays reacting in the RCM and the engine clearly showed a significant reduction of soot formation in the spray. Reductions of soot and NO x emissions as well as the fuel consumption were also confirmed by emission measurements and a combustion analysis respectively. In other experiments, different types of mixed fuel consisting of gas or gasoline and gas oil were tested to see the effects on both the evaporation and ignition processes.

The range of this assessment however is limited to the quantitative filtration potential of urban vegetation. Deposition velocity was taken as a measure of filtration performance as a particle deposited on a plant is in effect taken from the atmosphere. As regarding published deposition velocities, there are differences of an order of magnitude between measured values and the results of model calculations. The average published value (\u223c1 cm s -1 ) corresponds to a reduction in pollutant concentration (PM 10 ) of about 1 % in urban areas.

Within this framework, we explore a broad range of economically feasible greenhouse gas scenarios from the integrated assessment community to determine the likelihood of meeting a combination of specific global and regional targets under various assumptions.

Four numerical experiments, where an extra pulse of aircraft NOx was emitted into the model atmosphere for a single month (January, April, July, or October), were compared to a control experiment, allowing the aircraft impact to be isolated. The extra NOx produces a short-lived (few months) pulse of ozone that generates a positive radiative forcing. However, the NOx and O3 both generate OH, which leads to a reduction in CH4. A detailed analysis of the OH budget reveals the spatial structure and chemical reactions responsible for the generation of the OH perturbation. Methane's long lifetime means that the CH4 anomaly decays slowly (perturbation lifetime of 11.1 years). The negative CH4 anomaly also has an associated negative O3 anomaly, and both of these introduce a negative radiative forcing. There are important seasonal differences in the response of O3 and CH4 to aircraft NOx, related to the annual cycle in photochemistry; the O3 radiative forcing calculations also have a seasonal dependence. The long-term globally integrated annual mean net forcing calculated here is approximately zero, although earlier work suggests a small net positive forcing.

The effect of controlling ozone precursors on sensitivity regimes was evaluated by performing simulations with MM5-EMICAT2000-CMAQ model to represent O3 formation in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula with baseline emission rates for VOC and NOx, and reducing anthropogenic VOC and NOx emissions on a 35%. Three different scenarios were considered in order to assess chemical sensitivity in urban, industrial, and background domains. Areas downwind of the city of Barcelona benefit from NOx reductions (reduction of 10 ppb in ground-level O3), while the same reduction causes an important increment of O3 in Barcelona (9 ppb) and the area downwind of Tarragona (18 ppb), with a high industrial influence. The city of Barcelona benefits from VOC reductions (10 ppb of O3) as well as the industrial zone of Alcover (20 ppb). The rest of the domain is practically insensitive to VOC reductions. Diverse photochemical species derived from the air quality model were used as indicators in order to establish the chemical sensitivity regime existing in the areas, analyzing whether O3 values reacted consistently to similar changes in emissions. Results showed that NOy (total reactive nitrogen) and O3/NOy are the indicators involving a lower uncertainty when assessing sensitivity, according to the narrow transition regime between NOx- and VOC-sensitive chemistry and the low uncertainty observed. Indicators performed better in VOC-sensitive than in NOx-sensitive domains. H2O2- and HNO3- derived indicators entailed higher uncertainties since transition regimes between NOx and VOC sensitivity covered a wide range.

In these experiments the concentration of oxygen in the reactor has been varied from 4 g O 2 m \u22123 to 0 g O 2 m \u22123 . As NO and N 2 O might be produced by nitrifiers as well, the sludge used was unable to nitrify due to a low sludge age. High nitrite as well as aerobic conditions favor the production of N 2 O but not the production of NO. Furthermore, NO was accumulated at very low concentration and the highest emission was under completely anoxic conditions. A mathematical model has been formulated describing the reduction of nitrate, nitrite, and nitrous oxide. Noncompetitive inhibition of these processes by oxygen and nitrite has been included in the kinetics. The estimated parameters indicate that nitrite serves mainly as a denitrification intermediate rather than as an inhibitor. The net-production of N 2 O at low oxygen concentrations can be explained by different oxygen inhibition of the three reduction steps. The fast reduction of N 2 O is most inhibited by oxygen. As a consequence, the reduction of N 2 O is a slower process under low oxygen pressure than the reduction of nitrate and nitrite.", "year": 1994}, {"paperId": "08fc8394d7e311ab1d43bcbf2b687859a01965a2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2116461222", "DOI": "10.2478/ijnaoe-2013-0107", "CorpusId": 54845059}, "title": "On the energy economics of air lubrication drag reduction", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Air lubrication techniques for frictional drag reduction on ships have been proposed by numerous researchers since the 19th century.

Abstract Maritime activities constitute a significant fraction of anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants in Europe. In 2000, SO 2 and NO x emissions from international maritime shipping in Europe amounted to approximately 30 percent of the land-based emissions in the EU-25. While legislation is in force to control emission from international shipping, the expected increase in the volume of ship movements will compensate the positive environmental impacts of these measures and will lead to a further growth in ship emissions. Under business-as-usual assumptions, by 2020 emissions from maritime activities would come close to the projected baseline emission levels from land-based sources, and surpass the target levels established by the European Commission in its Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution for land-based sources. This anticipated increase in ship emissions will counteract the envisaged benefits of the costly efforts to control the remaining emissions from land-based sources in Europe. While at present emissions from ships are responsible for 10 to 20 percent of sulphur deposition in coastal areas, their contribution is expected for 2020 to increase to more than 30 percent in large areas in Europe, and up to 50 percent in coastal areas. Technologies exist to reduce emissions from shipping beyond what is currently legally required. The study has identified a set of emission control measures that are technically available and that could \u2013 if fully applied \u2013 reduce by 2020 80 percent of the SO 2 emissions from international shipping, and almost 90 percent of the NO x emissions. Total costs of these measures are estimated at 5.5 billion \u20ac/yr. For comparison, the costs of the measures proposed by the Thematic Strategy amount to 7.1 billion \u20ac/yr. The study has explored several packages of measures that could reduce emissions at lower costs. These include combinations of seawater sulphur scrubbing, lower sulphur content in residual oil, humid air engines for new built ships, slide valves retrofitting in existing ship engines, as well as the use of selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Marginal costs of these measures are well below the costs of the measures for land-based sources that have been proposed by the Thematic Strategy.

In a previous study in which two-year field experiments were conducted at nine sites across Japan, prolonged MD was found to reduce the seasonal total CH4 emission by 30.5\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7\u00a0% (mean\u2009\u00b1\u200995\u00a0% confidence interval) compared with conventional MD without compromising rice grain yield. However, the degree of CH4 reduction by water management is dependent on prevailing weather conditions. To estimate the mean effect of prolonged MD on CH4 emission at the nine sites with rice straw application, we conducted a long-term (20\u00a0years) simulation using a process-based biogeochemistry model, the DNDC-Rice. The model adjusted using site-specific parameters was able to reproduce the measured magnitude of the total CH4 emission and the suppressive effect of prolonged MD. The number of nonrainy days during MD explained the degree of CH4 reduction for each site and all sites combined. In the simulation, mean reduction percentage was 20.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6\u00a0% when acceptable prolonged MD (i.e., having less than 15\u00a0% yield loss) was applied compared with conventional MD. The discrepancy of the percentage between measurement and simulation was primarily attributable to longer nonrainy days during prolonged MD at several sites in the measurement than the mean of 20-year simulation.

Polyphosphate-capped CdS QDs were sensitive to nearly all mono- and divalent cations, showing no ion selectivity. Conversely, thioglycerol-capped CdS QDs were sensitive to only copper and iron ions. Similar concentrations of physiologically relevant cations, such as zinc, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium ions did not affect the luminescence of thioglycerol-capped CdS QDs. On the other hand, L-cysteine-capped CdS QDs were sensitive to zinc ions and insensitive to other physiologically important cations, such as copper, calcium, and magnium ions. To demonstrate the detection capability of these new ion probes, L-cysteine and thioglycerol-capped CdS QDs were used to detect zinc and copper ions in physiological buffer samples. The detection limits were 0.8 microM for zinc (II) and 0.1 microM for copper (II) ions. The emission enhancement of the QDs by zinc (II) is attributed to activation of surface states, whereas the effective reduction of copper (II) to copper (I) may explain the emission decrease of the thioglycerol-capped CdS QDs when charged with copper ions. Unlike organic fluorescent dyes, the thioglycerol-capped luminescent CdS QDs discriminate between copper and zinc ions and are therefore suitable for the analysis of copper ions in biological samples in the presence of physiological concentrations of zinc ions. The interference of iron ions with zinc and copper ion detection is attributed to an inner filter effect, which is eliminated by adding fluoride ions to form the colorless complex FeF6(3-).

Strategies to reduce these CO2 emissions include energy efficiency improvement, new processes, shift to low carbon fuels or waste fuels in cement production, increased use of additives in cement production, alternative cements, and CO2 removal from flue gases in clinker kilns. Increased use of fly ash as an additive to cement and concrete has a number of advantages, the primary being reduction of costs of fly ash disposal, resource conservation, and cost reduction of the product. Since the production of cement requires a large amount of energy (about 2.9-3.2 GJt-1), the substitution of cement by fly ash saves not only energy but also reduces the associated greenhouse gas emissions. The paper evaluates the reduction of CO2 emissions that can be achieved by these mitigation strategies, as well as by partial substitution of cement by fly ash. The latter is important because the quality of the produced concrete depends on the physical-chemical properties of the fly ash and thus partial substitution as well as the type of fly ash (e.g., the content of CaO) has an effect not only on energy consumption and emissions, but also on the produced concrete quality.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "2dfbc12a67bf58dfc7ba9699ed13ce49510bf497", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2463479250", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-16-8559-2016", "CorpusId": 54009756}, "title": "Time-resolved characterization of primary particle emissions and secondary particle formation from a modern gasoline passenger car", "abstract": "Abstract.

In this study, a well-to-pump life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to investigate the overall sustainability and net energy balance of an algal biodiesel process. The goal of this LCA was to provide baseline information for the algae biodiesel process.Materials and methodsThe functional unit was 1,000\u00a0MJ of energy from algal biodiesel using existing technology. Systematic boundary identification was performed using relative mass, energy, and economic value method using a 5% cutoff value. Primary data for this study were obtained from The USLCI database and the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy use in Transportation model. Carbohydrates in coproducts from algae biodiesel production were assumed to displace corn as a feedstock for ethanol production.Results and discussionFor every 24\u00a0kg of algal biodiesel produced (1,000\u00a0MJ algae biodiesel), 34 kg coproducts are also produced. Total energy input without solar drying is 3,292 and 6,194\u00a0MJ for the process with filter press and centrifuge as the initial filtering step, respectively. Net CO2 emissions are \u221220.9 and 135.7\u00a0kg/functional unit for a process utilizing a filter press and centrifuge, respectively. In addition to the \u221213.96\u00a0kg of total air emissions per functional unit, 18.6\u00a0kg of waterborne wastes, 0.28\u00a0kg of solid waste, and 5.54\u00a0Bq are emitted. The largest energy input (89%) is in the natural gas drying of the algal cake. Although net energy for both filter press and centrifuge processes are \u22126,670 and \u22123,778\u00a0MJ/functional unit, respectively, CO2 emissions are positive for the centrifuge process while they are negative for the filter press process. Additionally, 20.4\u00a0m3 of wastewater per functional unit is lost from the growth ponds during the 4-day growth cycle due to evaporation.Conclusions and recommendationsThis LCA has quantified one major obstacle in algae technology: the need to efficiently process the algae into its usable components. Thermal dewatering of algae requires high amounts of fossil fuel derived energy (3,556\u00a0kJ/kg of water removed) and consequently presents an opportunity for significant reduction in energy use.

In response, the purpose of this research is to explore the feasibility of integrating noise and emissions as optimization objectives at the aircraft conceptual design stage, thereby allowing a quantitative analysis of the tradeoffs between environmental performance and operating cost. A preliminary design tool that uses a multiobjective genetic algorithm to determine optimal aircraft configurations and to estimate the sensitivities between the conflicting objectives of low noise, low emissions, and operating costs was developed. Beyond evaluating the ability of a design to meet regulations and establishing environmental performance trades, the multidisciplinary design tool allows the generation of conventional but extremely low-noise and low-emissions designs that could, in the future, dramatically decrease the environmental impact of commercial aviation, albeit at the expense of increased operating cost.

The persistence of these pollutants, in combination with a rapid rise in vehicle travel in recent decades, has raised concerns within the planning and public health communities about the long-term success of an air quality management program that is effectively divorced from the land use planning process. Purpose: This work, which is part of an EPA-sponsored study titled Projecting the Impact of Land Use and Transportation on Future Air Quality (PLUTO), was intended to assess the effectiveness of compact growth in improving air quality at a geographic scale compatible with secondary pollution formation and transport and over a planning horizon sufficient to capture the longer-term benefits of regional land use change. Methods: Future air quality is associated with alternative land development scenarios in this study through the integration of three separate and previously unrelated modeling components. These components consist of a set of standard population projection techniques, a household vehicle travel activity framework, and a mobile source emissions model (MOBILE 6) developed by the EPA. Results and conclusions: The results of our analysis find the median elasticity of vehicle travel with respect to density change over time to be \u22120.35, suggesting metropolitan areas can expect a 10% increase in population density to be associated with a 3.5% reduction in household vehicle travel and emissions. In addition, vehicle elasticities derived for urban and suburban census tracts across the 11 metro regions suggest density increments within urban zones (\u22120.43) to be more than twice as effective in reducing vehicle travel and emissions as density increments within suburban zones (\u22120.19). Takeaway for practice: We found compactness to be associated with greater reductions in vehicle travel than in previous studies, which suggests land use change can play a measurable role in improving regional air quality over time. Importantly, we found where compact growth occurs to be critically important to determining the extent to which higher density development reduces vehicle travel and emissions. We found the densifi-cation of urban zones to be more than twice as effective in reducing vehicle miles of travel and emissions as the densification of suburban zones, suggesting compact growth to be better for air quality than historical patterns of growth when densifying urban zones is given priority over non-urban zones.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "b8476e7d2d358ab292ea64a9efc6cbcaa63de1c5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2892087926", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/10/7/074007", "CorpusId": 54824297}, "title": "Ships going slow in reducing their NOx emissions : changes in 2005-2012 ship exhaust inferred from satellite measurements over Europe", "abstract": "We address the lack of temporal information on ship emissions, and report on rapid short-term variations of satellite-derived ship NOx emissions between 2005 and 2012 over European seas.

Reduction of NH3 volatilization has been shown to be possible, particularly with acidifying and adsorbent additives, and potential exists to develop further practical and cost-effective additives in this area. Masking, disinfecting, and oxidizing agents can provide short-term control of malodor, but as the capacity of these additives is finite, they require frequent reapplication. Microbial-based digestive additives may offer a solution to this problem as they are regenerative, but they appear to have been developed without a thorough understanding of microbiological processes occurring in livestock wastes. Currently, their use to reduce odor or NH3 emissions cannot be recommend. If the potential of these types of additives is to be realized, research needs to shift from simply evaluating these unknown products to investigating known strains of bacteria or enzymes with known modes of action. To protect the farmers' interest, standard independent test procedures are required to evaluate efficacy. Such tests should be simple and quantify the capacity of the additive to perform as claimed. The principle use of additives needs to be identified and addressed during their development. Producers may not use effective additives in one area if they further compound other problems that they perceived to be more important. There is the potential to use additives to treat other problems associated with livestock wastes, particularly to improve handling properties, reduce pollution potential to watercourses, and reduce pathogenic bacteria. Further work is required in these areas.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "75abca5e28c678b3a1dcb2aa220a1f65ed1d0f8e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2794529164", "DOI": "10.1016/J.PECS.2018.03.003", "CorpusId": 103196111}, "title": "Two-stage electrostatic precipitators for the reduction of PM2.5 particle emission", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "27259c267ce41830ba7261959060cc87709965ff", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2017600896", "DOI": "10.5547/ISSN0195-6574-EJ-VOL17-NO4-5", "CorpusId": 210189814}, "title": "CO2 Emission Reduction Costs in the Residential Sector: Behavioral Parameters in a Bottom-Up Simulation Model", "abstract": "Cost estimates for reducing energy-related CO2 emissions vary with modeling assumptions and methods. Much debate has centered on the tendency for top-down models to suggest high costs and for bottom-up models to suggest low costs. This study incorporates behavioral parameters, derived from end-use equipment acquisition surveys, in a bottom-up simulation model ofthe residential sector in order to probe the basis for differing cost estimates and to test various policy suggestions. Simulating the effect of carbon taxes on a business as usual forecast, the results suggest that a CO2 tax will lead to significant net costs of adjustment if the factors leading to higher private discount rates reflect in part real costs and risks. The results also suggest that it may be in society's interest to pursue fuel switching policies with equal or greater vigour than energy efficiency improvements for the goal of reducing CO2emissions in the residential sector. As further research helps to distinguish the significance of these perceived costs and risks, and to refine projections of technology costs, the inputs to the model can be adjusted in order to refine the estimates for policy makers of CO2 reduction costs and of appropriate strategies for achieving reduction goals.", "year": 1996}, {"paperId": "c288c6d44eec947468c5cf000141ed8116ab34bd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2039632717", "DOI": "10.1080/1354983042000219379", "CorpusId": 154121252}, "title": "The progress of English and Welsh local authorities in addressing climate change", "abstract": "This paper describes the progress that local authorities in England and Wales are making in adapting to the threat of climate change and taking action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The responses from surveys of local authorities in England and Wales carried out in 2000 (IDeA, Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: survey of activities and initiatives by local authorities. (Questionnaire and results) Improvement and Development Agency, 2000) and 2002 (Allman et al., Climate Change: a survey of local authorities, Local Government Association, 2002) were compared. Progress in implementing the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) five-step methodology (ICLEI, Local Government Implementation of Climate Protection\u2014report to the United Nations, International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, 1997) was used to identify the 'successful' local authorities. The barriers faced by these authorities were then compared with those faced by the remaining local authorities. Most local authorities are not making substantial progress. However, a small number have successfully prepared greenhouse gas emissions inventories, developed strategies and implemented adaptation and greenhouse gas reduction measures. These successful authorities have made progress despite the fact that addressing climate change is not a legal requirement. Their success is due to three key factors. Firstly, they have recognised the secondary benefits of tackling climate change, e.g. potential employment, improved quality of life and reduction in fuel poverty. Secondly, they have the strong political, professional and technical support necessary to champion climate change activities. Finally, they have worked in partnership with utilities, private, public and voluntary groups to raise the finance needed to implement measures both to adapt to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "365b27909eb52e00d8d39d6e959268d7153761d8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2013087446", "DOI": "10.1109/JQE.2008.2004000", "CorpusId": 42870605}, "title": "Self-Consistent Analysis of Strain-Compensated InGaN\u2013AlGaN Quantum Wells for Lasers and Light-Emitting Diodes", "abstract": "Strain-compensated InGaN-AlGaN quantum wells (QW) are investigated as improved active regions for lasers and light emitting diodes. The strain-compensated QW structure consists of thin tensile-strained AlGaN barriers surrounding the InGaN QW. The band structure was calculated by using a self-consistent 6-band kmiddotp formalism, taking into account valence band mixing, strain effect, spontaneous and piezoelectric polarizations, as well as the carrier screening effect. The spontaneous emission and gain properties were analyzed for strain-compensated InGaN-AlGaN QW structures with indium contents of 28%, 22%, and 15% for lasers (light-emitting diodes) emitting at 480 (500), 440 (450), and 405 nm (415 nm) spectral regimes, respectively. The spontaneous emission spectra show significant improvement of the radiative emission for strain-compensated QW for all three structures compared to the corresponding conventional InGaN QW, which indicates the enhanced radiative efficiency for light emitting diodes. Our studies show the improvement of the optical gain and reduction of the threshold current density from the use of strain-compensated InGaN-AlGaN QW as active regions for diode lasers.", "year": 2009}]}
