Typically, it is assumed that overall the noise may be characterized as Gaussian. Other PET-imaging-related studies have been specifically aimed at the reduction of noise represented by a Poisson or mixed Poisson + Gaussian model. The effectiveness of any approach to noise reduction greatly depends on a proper quantification of the characteristics of the noise present. This work examines the statistical properties of noise in PET images acquired with a GEMINI PET/CT scanner. Noise measurements have been performed with a cylindrical phantom injected with 11C and well mixed to provide a uniform activity distribution. Images were acquired using standard clinical protocols and reconstructed with filtered-backprojection (FBP) and row-action maximum likelihood algorithm (RAMLA). Statistical properties of the acquired data were evaluated and compared to five noise models (Poisson, normal, negative binomial, log-normal, and gamma). Histograms of the experimental data were used to calculate cumulative distribution functions and produce maximum likelihood estimates for the parameters of the model distributions. Results obtained confirm the poor representation of both RAMLA- and FBP-reconstructed PET data by the Poisson distribution.

From the CAM-Chem global simulation results, ozone concentrations in the lower to mid-troposphere (surface to ~300 hPa), from mid- to high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, decreases by the end of the 2050s (2057-2059) in RCP 4.5 compared to present (2001-2004), with the largest decrease of 4-10 ppbv occurring in the summer and the fall; and an increase as high as 10 ppbv in RCP 8.5 resulting from the increased methane emissions. From the regional model CMAQ simulation results, under the RCP 4.5 scenario (2057-2059), in the summer when photochemical reactions are the most active, the large ozone precursor emissions reduction leads to the greatest decrease of downscaled surface ozone concentrations compared to present (2001-2004), ranging from 6 to 10 ppbv. However, a few major cities show ozone increases of 3 to 7 ppbv due to weakened NO titration.

The objective of this study is to spatiotemporally assess the potential LUC dynamics resulting from an increased biofuel demand, the related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the potential effect of LUC mitigation measures. This assessment is demonstrated for LUC dynamics in Brazil towards 2030, considering an increase in the global demand for bioethanol as well as other agricultural commodities. The potential effects of three LUC mitigation measures (increased agricultural productivity, shift to second\u2010generation ethanol, and strict conservation policies) are evaluated by using a scenario approach. The novel modelling framework developed consists of the global Computable General Equilibrium model MAGNET, the spatiotemporal land use allocation model PLUC, and a GIS\u2010based carbon module. The modelling simulations illustrate where LUC as a result of an increased global ethanol demand (+26 \u00d7 109 L ethanol production in Brazil) is likely to occur. When no measures are taken, sugar cane production is projected to expand mostly at the expense of agricultural land which subsequently leads to the loss of natural vegetation (natural forest and grass and shrubland) in the Cerrado and Amazon.

All LUC mitigation measures show potential to reduce the loss of natural vegetation (18%\u201396%) as well as the LUC\u2010related GHG emissions (7%\u201360%). Although there are several uncertainties regarding the exact location and magnitude of LUC and related GHG emissions, this study shows that the implementation of LUC mitigation measures could have a substantial contribution to the reduction of LUC\u2010related emissions of bioethanol.

Manure injection can conserve nitrogen (N) by decreasing ammonia (NH) volatilization. However, the injection band also creates conditions that potentially favor nitrous oxide (NO) production: an abundant organic substrate-promoting microbial activity, anaerobic conditions favoring denitrification, and large local concentrations of N. We assessed differences in NH volatilization and NO emissions with broadcast application versus shallow disk injection of dairy slurry during the 2011 to 2013 growing seasons on a well-drained silt loam that received average manure-N application rates of 180 kg N ha via injection or 200 kg N ha via broadcast. Ammonia emissions were measured using a photoacoustic gas analyzer and chambers, and NO emissions were measured using syringes to draw timed samples from vented chambers with analysis by gas chromatograph. Results point to a 92 to 98% (3.02-11.05 kg NH-N ha) reduction in NH volatilization (for the initial sampling) with injection compared with broadcasting manure but also reveal 84 to 152% (725.9-3187.8 g NO-N ha) greater cumulative NO emissions. Although losses of N via NO emission were at least three orders of magnitude less than NH volatilization, their potential role as a greenhouse gas is of concern.

Contrary to most regions in the US, ozone in the northern Front Range metropolitan area (NFRMA) of Colorado was either stagnant or increasing between 2000 and 2015, despite substantial reductions in NOx emissions. We used available long-term ozone and NOx data in the NFRMA to investigate these trends. Ozone increased from weekdays to weekends for a number of sites in the NFRMA with weekend reductions in NO2 at two sites in downtown Denver, indicating that the region was in a NOx-saturated ozone production regime. The stagnation and increases in ozone in the NFRMA are likely due to a combination of decreasing NOx emissions in a NOx-saturated environment and increased anthropogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in the NFRMA. Further investigation of the weekend\u2013weekday effect showed that the region outside of the most heavily trafficked Denver area was transitioning to peak ozone production towards NOx-limited chemistry. This transition implies that continued NOx decreases will result in ozone being less sensitive to changes in either anthropogenic or biogenic VOC reactivity in the NFRMA. In contrast to anthropogenic VOCs, biogenic VOCs are unlikely to have increased in the NFRMA between 2000 and 2015, but are temperature dependent and likely vary by drought year. Ozone in the NFRMA has a temperature dependence, albeit smaller than many other US locations, consistent with biogenic VOC contributions to ozone production in the region. We show that while ozone increased with temperature in the NFRMA, which is consistent with a NOx-saturated regime coupled to temperature-dependent VOCs, this relationship is suppressed in drought years. We attribute this drought year suppression to decreased biogenic isoprene emissions due to long-term drought stress. Thus, while anthropogenic NOx and VOCs likely dominate ozone production regimes in the NFRMA, biogenic VOCs may also impact regional ozone and its temperature dependence.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "3bca3123e92f738768a59bbfe0ab29130b9ea12c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2769406780", "DOI": "10.1007/s10098-017-1461-7", "CorpusId": 158864251}, "title": "An optimization study of a palm oil-based regional bio-energy supply chain under carbon pricing and trading policies", "abstract": "Biomass residues due to their low bulk density typically require frequent transportation from biomass plantations in rural areas to conversion bio-energy power plants.

The Substitution Provision of the SO2 emissions trading program allows the owner or operator of an affected electric utility unit to voluntarily designate a non-affected electric unit to become subject to all compliance requirements of affected units and to receive SO2 traceable emission permits (allowances). We find that although the Substitution provision has had a rather small effect on the overall of the SO2 emissions trading program and on SO2 emissions reductions, there has been a significant participation, with more than half of the \"affected\" electric utilities using this voluntary option to reduce compliance costs. This provides further evidence to the notion that, in general, electric utilities are choosing cost-effective strategies to comply with SO2 limits. Consistent with that is our finding that transaction costs associated to the Substitution provision have been relatively low. In another result, we show that non-affected units have opted in, largely because their actual unrestricted emissions (i.e. emissions in the absence of regulation) are below their historic omissions and hence their allowance allocation. Other units have opted in because they have low marginal control costs, say, below allowance prices. While the latter effect reduce today's aggregate cost of compliance by shifting reduction from high cost affected units to low cost units (the flexibility effect), the first effect increases today's emissions and emissions in the future (the adverse selection effect). An ex post cost-benefit analysis suggests that the adverse selection effect dominates, in part because of low allowance prices from an ex ante perspective however, we show that this result may not hold.

The O3 pollution in Beijing showed a significant spatial distribution with strong regional contribution. The results suggested that the plume originating from Beijing urban areas greatly affected the O3 concentrations at the Dingling site, accounting for 55% of elevated O3 there, while O3 pollution in the Beijing urban areas resulted from both local emissions and those from Tianjin and the south of Hebei Province. Transport of O3 was responsible for about 70% of the regional O3 contribution to Beijing urban areas, while transport of O3 precursors accounted for the remainder.

The most important sources are landfills and animal husbandry. The N2O emissions, which come mainly from agriculture and the nitric acid industry are about 20 Gg in 1990 (uncertainty range 10\u201330 Gg). The development of the emissions to the year 2010 is reviewed in two scenarios: the base and the reduction scenarios.According to the base scenario, the Finnish CH4 emissions will decrease in the near future. Emissions from landfills, energy production, and transportation will decrease because of already decided and partly realized volume and technical changes in these sectors. The average reduction potential of 50%, as assumed in the reduction scenario, is considered achievable.N2O emissions, on the other hand, are expected to increase as emissions from energy production and transportation will grow due to an increasing use of fluidized bed boilers and catalytic converters in cars. The average reduction potential of 50%, as assumed in the reduction scenario, is optimistic.Anthropogenic CH4 and N2O emissions presently cause about 30% of the direct radiative forcing due to Finnish anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This share would be even larger if the indirect impacts of CH4 were included. The contribution of CH4 can be controlled due to its relatively short atmospheric lifetime and due to the existing emission reduction potential. Nitrous oxide has a long atmospheric lifetime and its emission control possiblities are limited consequently, the greenhouse impact of N2O seems to be increasing even if the emissions were limited somehow.", "year": 1996}, {"paperId": "daf736a66e0728d0bffed5668da0140b04e04661", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2952107099", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.2933641", "CorpusId": 197553068}, "title": "Defensive Investments and the Demand for Air Quality: Evidence from the NOx Budget Program", "abstract": "The demand for air quality depends on health impacts and defensive investments, but little research assesses the empirical importance of defenses.

This study, using California-specific information, aimed to analyse the GHG impacts of organics diversion through a life-cycle assessment (LCA).

This study confirms that all three options for organics management result in net reductions of GHG emissions, but it also shows that organics landfilling, when well-managed, generates greater GHG reductions.

Catalytic shift reactors convert most of the CO in the syngas into CO2, which is subsequently removed by physical absorption and then compressed to make it suitable for transport and permanent storage.Energy balances, performance and cost of electricity are evaluated for two plants based on a Texaco gasifier and a large, heavy-duty gas turbine giving an overall IGCC power output between 350 and 400 MW.

Soil moisture and nitrogen (N) are among the major factors limiting grassland productivity. In pastures, N fertilizer returns by grazing animals are spatially and temporally heterogenous, and we therefore hypothesized that responses of plants and soil processes to drought may differ at the patch level.MethodsUsing rain-exclusion roofs, we simulated severe summer drought in a three-year field experiment replicated at two grassland sites contrasting in climate and management intensity. The study included a factorial N application treatment encompassing the application of cattle urine and mineral nitrogen. Responses of plants, soil microbes, and soil organic matter were assessed (carbon and nitrogen pools). N2O emissions were measured on 72 dates, and soil N2O concentration profiles on 44 dates.ResultsPlant productivity responded negatively to drought and positively to N application. Interestingly, no or only small drought-effect were found on plant productivity when cumulated over the entire experimental duration, despite large effects during and shortly after the period when rain-exclusion roofs were installed. We further did not find evidence for compensatory growth after drought, and drought-effects did not differ between fertilizer hot spots and unaffected areas. In the short-term, soil microbial biomass responded positively to drought, but no long-term effects were detected. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions originated primarily from fertilizer hot spots, and these emissions were massively reduced under drought, with effects lasting throughout most of the growing season. On a growing season basis, N2O emissions were estimated to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower under drought.ConclusionsOverall, our data suggest that even severe summer drought may have relatively little effect on plant productivity in the type of grassland and climate investigated, at least when considered on an annual basis.

The OH radical is a key species in these oxidation processes. The photolysis of nitrous acid (HNO2), in the morning, leads to the direct formation of the OH radical and may therefore contribute significantly to the initiation of the daytime photochemistry in the polluted planetary boundary layer. But the formation of nitrous acid remains poorly understood: experimental studies imply that a suggested heterogeneous formation process involving NO2 is not efficient enough to explain the observed night-time build-up of HNO2 in polluted air masses. Here we describe kinetic investigations which indicate that the heterogeneous production of HNO2 from NO2 on suspended soot particles proceeds 105 to 107 times faster than on previously studied surfaces. We therefore propose that the interaction between NO2 and soot particles may account for the high concentrations of HNO2 in air masses where combustion sources contribute to air pollution by soot and NOx emissions. We believe that the observed HNO2 formation results from the reduction of NO2 in the presence of water by C\u2013O and C\u2013H groups in the soot.

Using a case study approach, we critically review the evidence from Australia, exploring how Australia has participated in global climate change negotiations and the way in which this emissions intensive country\u2019s national emissions reduction obligations have been met. The findings suggest that: (1) successful negotiation to include Article 3.7 (\u2018Adjusting the 1990 Baseline\u2019 or \u2018the Australia Clause\u2019) in the Kyoto Protocol significantly favored Australia\u2019s ability to meet its First Kyoto Commitment (2008\u20132012); and (2) successful bargaining for the accounting rule that allowed carbon credits from the first commitment period to be carried over to the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol benefitted Australia by 128 MtCO2e. At the national level, a lack of bipartisan political support for an effective mechanism to drive emissions reduction has also been problematic. While the introduction of the Carbon Pricing Mechanism (CPM) in 2012 reduced emissions from electricity production from about 199.1 MtCO2e to 180.8 MtCO2e in 2014, a change of government led to the abolition of the CPM in 2014 and emissions from electricity production subsequently rose to 187 MtCO2e in 2015 and 189 MtCO2e in 2016 with adverse impacts in many sectors as well as Australia\u2019s overall emissions. The current Australian government continues to undermine its commitment to mitigation and the integrity and credibility of its own emissions reductions policy, introducing a softer \u2018calculated baseline\u2019 for its own Safeguard Mechanism, which allows companies to upwardly adjust their calculated baselines on the basis of their highest expected emissions, permitting emissions in excess of their historical emissions.

To guarantee credibility of the international climate policy regime, robust measurement, reporting and verification procedures are required. Compared to concrete emission reduction projects, assessment of the additionality of NAMAs is difficult. As only a subset of policy options leads to directly quantifiable emission reductions, the challenge is to define procedures that are conservative and still provide incentives to embark on policies with long-term and indirect effects. This requires a combination of an approach using default parameters and monitoring of key factors. Experience from methodologies used under the Clean Development Mechanism should be taken into account. Analysis of a renewable energy feed-in tariff in Korea and a nationwide demand-side management programme in Thailand shows that for the former, additionality and emission impacts of policies can be assessed, but require centralized, transparent data collection systems, an effective sector organization.

This increases the costs incurred by the drivers, and also increases the amount of greenhouse gases that vehicles emit. Pavement condition can be improved through rehabilitation activities (resurfacing) to reduce the effects on users, but these activities also have significant cost and greenhouse gas emission impacts. The objective of pavement management is to minimize total societal (user and agency) costs. However, the environmental impacts associated with the cost-minimizing policy are not currently accounted for. Preliminary research has shown that the optimal policies for minimizing total costs and for minimizing total emissions do not coincide. Instead, there exists a range of potentially optimal decisions, known as the Pareto curve, in which it is not possible to decrease total emissions without increasing total costs and vice versa. The first part of the dissertation explores these tradeoffs for a system of pavement segments, taking the approach of an agency who looks to minimize their total costs subject to an emissions constraint. This expands on the existing literature where environmental aspects and costs had only been examined at a single facility level. Other pavement management optimization techniques either did not include costs, or did not examine tradeoffs between costs and environmental aspects. For a case study, a network was created from a subset of California\u2019s highways using available traffic data. The first step was to look at policies that have been used in practice. Caltrans applies a universal trigger roughness policy, which is a policy where all roads in the network are treated the same. Whenever any road reaches the designated trigger roughness value, it will be rehabilitated, independent of road geometry and traffic. The past policy by Caltrans used a trigger roughness value of 3.5 m/km and the current value is 2.7 m/km. Moving from the past policy to current policy was a good decision, resulting in reductions of 14% and 2.5% for GHG emissions and costs, respectively. Further reductions of 2.5% for emissions and 1.5% for costs could be achieved by switching to one of the optimal policies from our model, where different road sections have different trigger roughness values.The slope of the tangent of the Pareto curve gives the societal value of carbon at that point. If there is an accepted societal value of carbon, an agency may choose this as the policy to apply. Alternatively, an agency can use the carbon price as a way to determine feasible emissions reductions targets. If the slope of the curve corresponding to a given emissions constraint was higher than carbon has been valued on the market, the agency may want to reconsider the target. Furthermore, if the emissions target is lower than the emissions minimizing point, the agency can deem the target infeasible without policy change.Policy changes, such as reducing vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) or improving construction standards, can shift the Pareto curve. For the case of a reduction in VKT, leaving fewer vehicles on the road lowers the total user emissions and also allows the agency to resurface with less frequency. Agency costs and emissions contribute more to the total than user costs and emissions, so larger reductions in the total can be achieved from changes by the agency. Improved construction standards also lead to lower societal costs and emissions. A reduction in the best achievable roughness by 0.25m/km after resurfacing would reduce total costs by 6.5% and total emissions by 9%. Users would now drive on roads in better condition and the agency would not need to resurface as often since roads in better condition deteriorate more slowly.The first part of the dissertation does not account for the case where the available budget to the agency is binding. As an alternative approach, in the second part of the dissertation we look at an agency whose main goal is to reduce its carbon footprint while operating under a constrained budget. Literature considering agency budgets had only considered minimizing total costs or maintaining a certain level of condition in the network. A methodology is applied which selects the optimal timing and optimal action from a set of alternatives for each segment while still retaining the Lagrangian dual formulation. This new formulation quantifies GHG emission savings per additional dollar of agency budget spent, which can be used in a cap-and-trade system or to make budget decisions.We discuss the importance of communication between agencies and their legislature that sets the financial budgets to implement sustainable policies. Using our results, an agency could make a case for needing a certain budget to hit its GHG reduction goals. If it cannot receive any more money for its budget from the legislature, it could sell carbon credits by quantifying the amount of GHG emissions that will be reduced by applying the money they will receive to their rehabilitation budget. We look at the same case study of California roads from the previous section, but now apply this new approach and methodology. We show that it is optimal to apply frequent, thin overlays if the objective is to minimize GHG emissions. This is contrary to the less frequent, thick overlays recommended for minimizing total costs in the literature, but matches what the Washington State Department of Transportation does in practice.This approach confirms that a universal trigger roughness policy is sub optimal. At every possible budget, there is still a range of optimal trigger roughness values. As agency budgets become lower, the range of optimal trigger roughness widens. This is because it becomes more important to spend the little money they have rehabilitating the segments which will result in the largest reductions. Sensitivity analyses were performed with respect to the fuel consumption due to roughness, deterioration rate, and best achievable roughness level, and the solutions were found to be robust with respect to all three parameters.Reducing asphalt emissions by using warm mix asphalt (WMA) were found to only be significant when agency budgets are high. However, at those budget values, the cost of carbon to the agency is upwards of $700 per metric ton (mt) of CO2e, which is significantly higher than carbon has ever been valued on the market. This makes it unlikely that an agency will ever operate at those budget levels, so WMA will not be beneficial for rehabilitation policy. Reductions in asphalt cost see much more significant results, but only when agency budgets are low. A reduction in cost at a low budget effectively gives the agency more money and allows it to rehabilitate more roads where the amount of GHG emissions saved per dollar of agency budget is the highest.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "961be91ec05d3f4f1b7f6873a13c934f245cfeae", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2027184374", "DOI": "10.1115/DSCC2008-2179", "CorpusId": 109424623}, "title": "Modeling and Control of Hybrid Electric Vehicles for Fuel and Emission Reduction", "abstract": "Control of Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) is an active research area.

Minimization of fuel consumption may have a trickle-down effect but does not guarantee reduced emissions. In fact, over-zealous pursuit of fuel consumption reduction may compromise emission. This paper investigates the emissions formation mechanism, develops an emission model that predicts tail-pipe emissions, and formulates a supervisory control problem of emissions reduction. The Dynamic Programming (DP) technique is employed to solve the optimal control problem of parallel HEVs for both emission reduction and fuel economy.

Tidal height correlated positively with dissolved O2 and negatively with pCO2, CH4, total alkalinity (TAlk) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and pCO2 and CH4 were always highly supersaturated (330\u20131,627\u00a0% CO2; 339\u201326,930\u00a0% CH4). These data are consistent with a tidal pumping response to hydrostatic pressure change. There were no seasonal trends in dissolved CH4 but pCO2 was around twice as high during the 2005 wet season than at other times, in both the tidal surveys and the inshore transects. Fourfold higher turbidity during the wet season is consistent with elevated net benthic and/or water column heterotrophy via enhanced organic matter inputs from adjacent mangrove forest and/or the flushing of CO2-enriched soil waters, which may explain these CO2 data. TAlk/DIC relationships in the tidally pumped waters were most consistent with a diagenetic origin of CO2 primarily via sulphate reduction, with additional inputs via aerobic respiration. A decrease with salinity for pCO2, CH4, TAlk and DIC during the inshore transects reflected offshore transport of tidally pumped waters.

Cows were fed (ad libitum) RCS- or CS-based diets [forage:concentrate ratio 60:40; dry matter (DM) basis] without or with LO (4% of DM). Supplementation of LO to the RCS-based diet reduced enteric CH4 production (-9%) and CH4 energy losses (-11%) with no adverse effects on DM intake, digestion, ruminal fermentation characteristics, protozoa numbers, or milk production. The addition of LO to the CS-based diet caused a greater decrease in CH4 production (-26%) and CH4 energy losses (-23%) but was associated with a reduction in DM intake, total-tract fiber digestibility, protozoa numbers, acetate:propionate ratio, and energy-corrected milk yield. Urinary N excretion (g/d) decreased with LO supplementation to RCS- and CS-based diets, suggesting reduced potential of N2O emissions. Results from this study show that the depressive effect of LO supplementation on enteric CH4 production is more pronounced with the CS- than with the RCS-based diet. However, because of reduced digestibility with the CS-based diet, the reduction in enteric CH4 production may be offset by higher CH4 emissions from manure storage.

Cities have unique and strong influence over several policy levers \u2013 from urban planning to public transportation \u2013 that make them critical actors in reducing GHG emissions, avoiding further carbon lock-in, and decreasing the cost of future abatement. We find that urban actions could decrease global GHG emissions by 3.7 Gt CO2e in 2030, compared with a reference scenario, and by 8.0 Gt CO2e in 2050. The greatest reductions arise from deep improvements in residential building energy efficiency and from a transition to efficient public transport for personal urban mobility.

At the same time, because few of the actions considered here are explicitly included in current national pledges, pursuit of this abatement could help raise the ambition of those pledges, or help nations deepen new commitments currently under consideration. Even greater reductions could be possible if cities were to demonstrate low-carbon lifestyles for categories of consumption not covered by this analysis, such as product purchasing and food consumption.

This article uses historical data and ecosystem models to estimate the magnitude of annual GHG fluxes from all agricultural sources (cropping, livestock, irrigation, fertilizer production, and tractor use) from 1870 to 2000. Carbon (C) emissions from plow-out of native grasslands peaked in the 1930s and were the largest agricultural source of GHG emissions at the time. Soil C emissions subsequently declined, whereas GHG fluxes from other activities increased. The results inform knowledge about the relationship between agriculture and its environmental setting and show that available alternative management practices could substantially mitigate the environmental consequences of agricultural activities without reducing food production. The Great Plains region of the United States is an agricultural production center for the global market and, as such, an important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This article uses historical agricultural census data and ecosystem models to estimate the magnitude of annual GHG fluxes from all agricultural sources (e.g., cropping, livestock raising, irrigation, fertilizer production, tractor use) in the Great Plains from 1870 to 2000. Here, we show that carbon (C) released during the plow-out of native grasslands was the largest source of GHG emissions before 1930, whereas livestock production, direct energy use, and soil nitrous oxide emissions are currently the largest sources. Climatic factors mediate these emissions, with cool and wet weather promoting C sequestration and hot and dry weather increasing GHG release. This analysis demonstrates the long-term ecosystem consequences of both historical and current agricultural activities, but also indicates that adoption of available alternative management practices could substantially mitigate agricultural GHG fluxes, ranging from a 34% reduction with a 25% adoption rate to as much as complete elimination with possible net sequestration of C when a greater proportion of farmers adopt new agricultural practices.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "897dab008c16f9d6b1145d03fe8f0e45dae00683", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2167669774", "DOI": "10.1162/089892902760191117", "CorpusId": 6087305, "PubMed": "12191456"}, "title": "Hypnosis Modulates Activity in Brain Structures Involved in the Regulation of Consciousness", "abstract": "The notion of consciousness is at the core of an ongoing debate on the existence and nature of hypnotic states.

Immediately after each of 8 PET scans performed before (4 scans) and after (4 scans) the induction of hypnosis, subjects rated their perceived level of mental relaxation and mental absorption, two of the key dimensions describing the experience of being hypnotized. Regression analyses between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and self-ratings confirm the hypothesized involvement of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the thalamus, and the ponto-mesencephalic brainstem in the production of hypnotic states. Hypnotic relaxation further involved an increase in occipital rCBF that is consistent with our previous interpretation that hypnotic states are characterized by a decrease in cortical arousal and a reduction in cross-modality suppression (disinhibition). In contrast, increases in mental absorption during hypnosis were associated with rCBF increases in a distributed network of cortical and subcortical structures previously described as the brain's attentional system. These findings are discussed in support of a state theory of hypnosis in which the basic changes in phenomenal experience produced by hypnotic induction reflect, at least in part, the modulation of activity within brain areas critically involved in the regulation of consciousness.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "09c574328ca4ed626549de37696ec0338dbe14bd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2279433036", "DOI": "10.4271/2003-01-3105", "CorpusId": 111803049}, "title": "Development and analysis of a spray-guided DISI combustion system concept", "abstract": "An innovative stratified-charge DISI combustion concept has been developed using a mixture formation method referred to as Vortex Induced Stratification Combustion (VISC).

The electrochemical conversion of CO2 to chemicals, fuels, and feedstocks has shown enough promise in the past decade to justify both academic and industrial sectors to increase efforts to better assess the potential economic and technical feasibility of the technology. Intensifying the process toward an industrial scale can be achieved by higher production rates, either by simply increasing the total area of catalyst in a reactor or by increasing the reaction rate (current density) for a given area of catalyst. Both approaches will be needed to economically produce an industrial quantity of product in a single plant (e.g., >100 tons product/day). In electrochemical CO2 reduction, however, increasing current densities to those needed for commercial operation (e.g., >200 mA/cm) requires researchers to use cell designs that can supply enough CO2 to the catalyst layer to fuel the reaction, as opposed to traditional H-cell reactors. For these reasons, more and more researchers have begun using catalysts deposited onto gas-diffusion layers (GDLs), where high concentrations of CO2 can be maintained in close proximity to the catalyst layer even at high reaction rates. GDLs can also reduce overall cell potentials by directly improving catalytic activity, while a more system-focused testing platform can help reduce major system losses such as ohmic heating.

The Tommeliten seepage area is part of the Greater Ekofisk area, which is situated above the Tommeliten Delta salt diapir in the central North Sea (56\u00b029.90' N, 2\u00b059.80' E, Norwegian Block 1/9, 75 m water depth). Here, cracks in a buried marl horizon allow methane to migrate into overlying clay-silt and sandy sediments. Hydroacoustic sediment echosounding showed several venting spots coinciding with the apex of marl domes where methane is released into the water column and potentially to the atmosphere. In the vicinity of the gas seeps, sea floor observations showed small mats of giant sulphide-oxidizing bacteria above patches of black sediments as well as carbonate crusts, which are exposed 10 to 50 cm above seafloor forming small reefs. These Methane-Derived Authigenic Carbonates (MDACs) contain 13C-depleted, archaeal lipids indicating previous gas seepage and AOM activity. High amounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol and low abundances of biphytanes in the crusts give evidence that ANaerobic MEthane-oxidising archaea (ANME) of the phylogenetic cluster ANME-2 were the potential mediators of Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane (AOM) at the time of carbonate formation. Small pieces of MDACs were also found subsurface at about 1.7 m sediment depth, associated with the AOM zone. This zone is characterized by elevated AOM and Sulphate Reduction (SR) rates, increased concentrations of 13C-depleted tetraether derived biphytanes, and specific bacterial Fatty Acids (FA).

There is considerable literature on the effects of climate change on O3 but fewer studies on the effects of climate change on PM concentrations. Under the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th assessment report (AR5) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), background O3 entering Europe is expected to decrease under most scenarios due to higher water vapour concentrations in a warmer climate. However, under the extreme pathway RCP8.5 higher (more than double) methane (CH4) abundances lead to increases in background O3 that offset the O3 decrease due to climate change especially for the 2100 period. Regionally, in polluted areas with high levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx), elevated surface temperatures and humidities yield increases in surface O3 \u2013 termed the O3 climate penalty \u2013 especially in southern Europe. The O3 response is larger for metrics that represent the higher end of the O3 distribution, such as daily maximum O3. Future changes in PM concentrations due to climate change are much less certain, although several recent studies also suggest a PM climate penalty due to high temperatures and humidity and reduced precipitation in northern mid-latitude land regions in 2100.A larger number of studies have examined both future climate and emissions changes under the RCP scenarios. Under these pathways the impact of emission changes on air quality out to the 2050s will be larger than that due to climate change, because of large reductions in emissions of O3 and PM pollutant precursor emissions and the more limited climate change response itself. Climate change will also affect climate extreme events such as heatwaves. Air pollution episodes are associated with stagnation events and sometimes heat waves. Air quality during the 2003 heatwave over Europe has been examined in numerous studies and mechanisms for enhancing O3 have been identified.There are few studies on health effects associated with climate change impacts alone on air quality, but these report higher O3-related health burdens in polluted populated regions and greater PM2.5 health burdens in these emission regions. Studies that examine the combined impacts of climate change and anthropogenic emissions change under the RCP scenarios report reductions in global and European premature O3-respiratory related and PM mortalities arising from the large decreases in precursor emissions. Under RCP 8.5 the large increase in CH4 leads to global and European excess O3-respiratory related mortalities in 2100.

Breitburg et al. review the evidence for the downward trajectory of oxygen levels in increasing areas of the open ocean and coastal waters. Rising nutrient loads coupled with climate change\u2014each resulting from human activities\u2014are changing ocean biogeochemistry and increasing oxygen consumption. This results in destabilization of sediments and fundamental shifts in the availability of key nutrients. In the short term, some compensatory effects may result in improvements in local fisheries, such as in cases where stocks are squeezed between the surface and elevated oxygen minimum zones. In the longer term, these conditions are unsustainable and may result in ecosystem collapses, which ultimately will cause societal and economic harm. Science, this issue p. eaam7240 BACKGROUND Oxygen concentrations in both the open ocean and coastal waters have been declining since at least the middle of the 20th century. This oxygen loss, or deoxygenation, is one of the most important changes occurring in an ocean increasingly modified by human activities that have raised temperatures, CO2 levels, and nutrient inputs and have altered the abundances and distributions of marine species. Oxygen is fundamental to biological and biogeochemical processes in the ocean. Its decline can cause major changes in ocean productivity, biodiversity, and biogeochemical cycles. Analyses of direct measurements at sites around the world indicate that oxygen-minimum zones in the open ocean have expanded by several million square kilometers and that hundreds of coastal sites now have oxygen concentrations low enough to limit the distribution and abundance of animal populations and alter the cycling of important nutrients. ADVANCES In the open ocean, global warming, which is primarily caused by increased greenhouse gas emissions, is considered the primary cause of ongoing deoxygenation. Numerical models project further oxygen declines during the 21st century, even with ambitious emission reductions. Rising global temperatures decrease oxygen solubility in water, increase the rate of oxygen consumption via respiration, and are predicted to reduce the introduction of oxygen from the atmosphere and surface waters into the ocean interior by increasing stratification and weakening ocean overturning circulation. In estuaries and other coastal systems strongly influenced by their watershed, oxygen declines have been caused by increased loadings of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and organic matter, primarily from agriculture; sewage; and the combustion of fossil fuels. In many regions, further increases in nitrogen discharges to coastal waters are projected as human populations and agricultural production rise. Climate change exacerbates oxygen decline in coastal systems through similar mechanisms as those in the open ocean, as well as by increasing nutrient delivery from watersheds that will experience increased precipitation. Expansion of low-oxygen zones can increase production of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas; reduce eukaryote biodiversity; alter the structure of food webs; and negatively affect food security and livelihoods. Both acidification and increasing temperature are mechanistically linked with the process of deoxygenation and combine with low-oxygen conditions to affect biogeochemical, physiological, and ecological processes. However, an important paradox to consider in predicting large-scale effects of future deoxygenation is that high levels of productivity in nutrient-enriched coastal systems and upwelling areas associated with oxygen-minimum zones also support some of the world\u2019s most prolific fisheries. OUTLOOK Major advances have been made toward understanding patterns, drivers, and consequences of ocean deoxygenation, but there is a need to improve predictions at large spatial and temporal scales important to ecosystem services provided by the ocean. Improved numerical models of oceanographic processes that control oxygen depletion and the large-scale influence of altered biogeochemical cycles are needed to better predict the magnitude and spatial patterns of deoxygenation in the open ocean, as well as feedbacks to climate. Developing and verifying the next generation of these models will require increased in situ observations and improved mechanistic understanding on a variety of scales. Models useful for managing nutrient loads can simulate oxygen loss in coastal waters with some skill, but their ability to project future oxygen loss is often hampered by insufficient data and climate model projections on drivers at appropriate temporal and spatial scales. Predicting deoxygenation-induced changes in ecosystem services and human welfare requires scaling effects that are measured on individual organisms to populations, food webs, and fisheries stocks; considering combined effects of deoxygenation and other ocean stressors; and placing an increased research emphasis on developing nations. Reducing the impacts of other stressors may provide some protection to species negatively affected by low-oxygen conditions. Ultimately, though, limiting deoxygenation and its negative effects will necessitate a substantial global decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, as well as reductions in nutrient discharges to coastal waters. Low and declining oxygen levels in the open ocean and coastal waters affect processes ranging from biogeochemistry to food security. The global map indicates coastal sites where anthropogenic nutrients have exacerbated or caused O2 declines to <2 mg liter\u22121 (<63 \u03bcmol liter\u22121) (red dots), as well as ocean oxygen-minimum zones at 300 m of depth (blue shaded regions). [Map created from data provided by R. Diaz, updated by members of the GO2NE network, and downloaded from the World Ocean Atlas 2009]. Oxygen is fundamental to life. Not only is it essential for the survival of individual animals, but it regulates global cycles of major nutrients and carbon. The oxygen content of the open ocean and coastal waters has been declining for at least the past half-century, largely because of human activities that have increased global temperatures and nutrients discharged to coastal waters. These changes have accelerated consumption of oxygen by microbial respiration, reduced solubility of oxygen in water, and reduced the rate of oxygen resupply from the atmosphere to the ocean interior, with a wide range of biological and ecological consequences. Further research is needed to understand and predict long-term, global- and regional-scale oxygen changes and their effects on marine and estuarine fisheries and ecosystems.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "112a65a3906d7bec4dd4160e07d82002d9f1bb87", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/soco/GaldiIPV01", "MAG": "2095362784", "DOI": "10.1007/s005000100129", "CorpusId": 43370291}, "title": "A genetic-based methodology for hybrid electric vehicles sizing", "abstract": "Abstract\u2002As private transport concerns, the global challenge of this millennium is the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars by improving fuel economy without sacrificing the vehicle performance.

A mean 26.7% enhancement of ozone concentration above the ambient level (A\u2010O3) significantly reduced CH4 emission at tillering and flowering stages leading to a reduction of seasonal integral CH4 emission by 29.6% on average across the two cultivars. The reduced CH4 emission is associated with O3\u2010induced reduction in the whole\u2010plant biomass (\u221213.2%), root biomass (\u221234.7%), and maximum tiller number (\u221210.3%), all of which curbed the carbon supply for belowground CH4 production and its release from submerged soil to atmosphere.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) and the development of renewable and clean energy sources are two approaches for the reduction of CO2 emission. One of the most promising alternative fuels is CH4, which is the major component of natural gas. The efficient storage of CH4 is still one of the main challenges for its widespread application. Accordingly, the development of more efficient approaches for CO2 capture and CH4 storage is critically important. Recently, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs, e.g., MOF210 and NU-100) have shown great potential for gas storage because of their high specific surface area (SSA) and functionalized pore walls. However, most MOF materials still show relatively low CO2 and CH4 uptakes. To enhance CO2 and CH4 adsorption, it is imperative to develop new materials, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs), or to modify MOFs by using postsynthetic approaches. Herein, we focus on the latter strategy. One of the modification approaches is incorporation of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into MOFs in order to achieve enhanced composite performance, because of the unusual mechanical and hydrophobicity properties of CNTs. Another approach is doping MOFs or COFs with electropositive metals. Recent studies indicate that the surface carboxylate functional groups of a substrate could act as nucleation sites to form MOFs by heterogeneous nucleation and crystal growth. Both experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that the H2 adsorption capacities of MOFs can be enhanced significantly by doping alkali-metal ions, in particular Li ions, to the frameworks, owing to the strong affinity of Li ions towards H2 molecules. [3d, 7] Similarly, Lan et al. also showed theoretically that doping of COFs with Li ions can significantly enhance the CH4 uptake of COFs. [8] Most recently, the multiscale simulations performed by Lan et al. indicate that Li is the best surface modifier of COFs for CO2 capture among a series of metals (Li, Na, K, Be, Mg Ca, Sc and Ti). Furthermore, their simulations show that the excess CO2 uptakes of the lithium-doped COFs can be enhanced by four to eight times compared to the undoped COFs at 298 K and 1 bar. Motivated by these experimental and theoretical results, we synthesized hybrid MOF materials by using the two modification techniques outlined above, that is, 1) incorporation of CNTs into [Cu3(C9H3O6)2(H2O)3]\u00b7x H2O ([Cu3(btc)2], HKUST-1; btc = 1,3,5-benzenetricarboxylate), which is an important MOF material owing to its open metal sides and high thermal stabilities, as well as its sorption properties, 10] and 2) doping [Cu3(btc)2] with Li + ions. We used lithium naphthalenide (LiC10H8 ) to introduce Li ions into the [Cu3(btc)2] frameworks.

Because this last parameter is sensitive to chemical factors but relatively insensitive to the number of days each year with meteorological conditions conducive to ozone formation, its trend may be best suited for determining how effective emission controls have been in reducing O3 in the Atlanta area. In spite of the fact that sizeable reductions have been claimed for volatile organic carbon emissions over the past several years, the data give no indication that ozone levels have decreased and in fact imply that summertime ozone production may have increased.
