Furthermore, to understand the mechanism of NO formation and reduction from wood com\u00ac bustion. Nitric oxides (NO) from wood combustion originate mainly from the nitrogen contained in the wood. For this study, a special 25 kW test reactor, comprising a fixed bed gasification Chamber, an electrically heated reduction Chamber and a combustion Chamber was built to examine the stage combustion of wood chips. In comparison with unstaged combustion, the NO emissions from staged combustion can be reduced by 70%. Optimum conditions in the first stage are a primary air ratio of 0.7, a reduction temperature of 1160\u00b0C and a residence time of more than 0.5 s. It was established that these conditions are independent of the nitrogen content of the fuel. Combustion temperature, excess air ratio, fuel moisture content and CO emissions have only a slight effect on the emission of NO. With advanced Staging the NO emissions can be reduced by 20%. N02 emissions of 75 mg/m3 and 220 mg/m3 (at 11% 02) were achieved with the com\u00ac bustion of wood and chip board respectively. Minimum conversion from fuelbound nitrogen to NO of 3% und 12% was realized with the staged combustion of chip board (nitrogen content = 2.73 wt.%) and wood chips (nitrogen content = 0.18 wt.%). However, only a modest NO reduction of 15% was achieved with flue gas recirculation into the primary air. The N20 emissions from staged fixed bed com\u00ac bustion of wood are less than 2 ppm. During the pyrolysis of wood, more than 30 wt.% of the nitrogen remains in the char. The release of nitrogen in the fixed bed is retarded. HCN and NH3 are formed with a primary air ratio of less than 0.8. In the reduction zone, NO reacts with NH2 radicals to N2. CO and H2 have no effect on this reaction. The decomposition of NO and NH3 is inhibited by CH4. NO can be reduced with CO or CH4 using wood ash as a catalyst. The conversion from the nitrogen Compounds to NO in the combustion Chamber depends on the concentration and the species.", "year": 1994}, {"paperId": "2e109cc7adf8023c0e23349799a7b358431c95a4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1565982513", "CorpusId": 128785303}, "title": "Climate Change and Sustainable Development: Prospects for Developing Countries", "abstract": "List of Figures, Tables and Boxes * List of Contributors * List of Acronyms and Abbreviations * Climate Change and Sustainable Development: An Overview * A Conceptual Framework for Analysing Climate Change in the Context of Sustainable Development * A Review of the Literature on Climate Change and Sustainable Development * Assessing Social Capital Aspects of Climate Change Projects * Analytical Approaches for Decision-making, Sustainable Development and Greenhouse Gas Emission-reduction Policies * Sustainability in Climate Mitigation: Integrating Equity into Project Analysis * Case Studies for Zimbabwe, Botswana, Mauritius and Thailand * The CDM and Sustainable Development: Case Studies from Brazil and India * Index", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "6bb5f563586e08f3ab400b0fedf0fea52a72e73b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2615703942", "DBLP": "journals/tcst/JamshidnejadPPS18", "DOI": "10.1109/TCST.2017.2699160", "CorpusId": 4887754}, "title": "Sustainable Model-Predictive Control in Urban Traffic Networks: Efficient Solution Based on General Smoothening Methods", "abstract": "Traffic-responsive control approaches, including model-predictive control (MPC), are efficient methods for making the best use of the available network capacity.

The transport sector will undoubtedly need to play a significant role in achieving carbon reductions if the government is to meet its ambitious long-term goal of a 60% reduction by 2050. This article examines current carbon use by households for personal land-based transport and considers how feasible it would be to change that use over the period up to 2050 in the United Kingdom. It provides a unique insight into how much and in what way households and individuals may be willing to adapt their transport behavior to achieve carbon reductions. A computer-based transport carbon calculator was developed to investigate the CO2 emissions of individual households from various modes based on travel diary information. This formed the focus of a series of interactive interviews in which participants were asked to consider how their future low carbon transport strategy could look. Views of households on various abatement measures were explored, including technological change in vehicle design or fuel source and behavioral change through, for instance, traffic restraint and investment in public transport. Overall, a 40% reduction in carbon emissions was seen to be feasible through a combination of behavioral change measures and a realistically achievable degree of technological improvement, falling well short of the UK government's goal of a 60% reduction. Through changes in behavior alone, the households involved could only achieve around a 20% cut in carbon emissions \u2014seemingly a threshold beyond which further reductions will be difficult and may necessitate significant lifestyle change.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "c22cfd794f8032dd64ff9624946089f40de244b4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3018096556", "DOI": "10.3390/atmos11040429", "CorpusId": 218997250}, "title": "Improving Air Quality in the Po Valley, Italy: Some Results by the LIFE-IP-PREPAIR Project", "abstract": "The Po Valley (Northern Italy) represents an important exceedance zone of the air-quality limit values for PM (particulate matter), NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) and O3 (ozone). This area covers the territory of most Italian northern regions and includes several urban agglomerates, such as Milan, Turin, Venice and Bologna. The area is densely populated and heavily industrialized. The paper summarizes the assessment of the impact of the current (2013) and future (2025) emissions and of the meteorological conditions on the air quality of the Po Valley. This study is one of the first outcomes of the EU LIFE-IP Clean Air Program Po Regions Engaged to Policies of Air (PREPAIR) project. The project, involving administrations and environmental agencies of eight regions and three municipalities in Northern Italy and Slovenia, started in 2017 and will end in 2024. Future emission scenarios consider the emissions reduction due to the air-quality action plans of the regions involved, of the agreements between the national authorities and regional administrations and of the PREPAIR project itself, in the overall context of the application of the current legislation of the European Union. The combination of these measures will lead to the reduction of direct emissions of PM10 in the Po Valley and of the main precursors emitted in the area (NOx, nitrogen oxides and NH3, and ammonia) by 38% for PM10, 39% for NOx and 22% for NH3, respectively. This lowering corresponds to a reduction of about 30.000 tons of primary PM10, 150.000 tons of NOx, 54.000 tons of NH3 and 1700 tons of SO2.

Few studies, however, have evaluated longitudinal declines in regional cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the available studies have not used recently developed brain mapping algorithms to characterize the progression of Alzheimer's disease throughout the brain, and none considered the statistical power of regional cerebral glucose metabolism in testing the ability of treatments to attenuate the progression of dementia.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe authors used FDG PET and a brain mapping algorithm to investigate cross-sectional reductions in regional cerebral glucose metabolism, longitudinal decline in regional cerebral glucose metabolism after a 1-year follow-up, and the power of this method to evaluate treatments for Alzheimer's disease in patients with mild to moderate dementia. PET scans were initially acquired in 14 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 34 healthy comparison subjects of similar age and sex. Repeat scans were obtained in the patients 1 year later. Power analyses for voxels showing maximal decline over the 1-year period in regional cerebral glucose metabolism (mg/100 g per minute) were computed to estimate the sample sizes needed to detect a significant treatment response in a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe patients with Alzheimer's disease had significantly lower glucose metabolism than healthy comparison subjects in parietal, temporal, occipital, frontal, and posterior cingulate cortices. One year later, the patients with Alzheimer's disease had significant declines in glucose metabolism in parietal, temporal, frontal, and posterior cingulate cortices.

The G-La2Si2O7:Eu2+ (LPS:Eu2+) phosphor exhibited tunable emission colors depending on the excitation wavelength or the Eu concentration, enabling the production of white light. The color tunable property is ascribed to the component ratio of the two specific luminescent centers, Eu(1) and Eu(2).

The gains from emissions trading could be big enough to give buyers and sellers incentive to support the system. Indeed, a global market for rights to emit carbon dioxide could reduce the cost of meeting the Kyoto targets by almost 90 percent, if the market were to operate competitively. The division of trading gains, however, may make a competitive outcome unlikely: Under perfect competition, the vast majority of trading gains go to buyers of permits rather than to sellers. Even markets in which the supply of permits is restricted can, however, substantially reduce the cost to Annex B countries of meeting their Kyoto targets, while yielding profits to developing countries that elect to sell permits.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "d04c64bb3be98f119d7281fba62b576b6182c725", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1968705879", "DOI": "10.3763/cpol.2008.0604", "CorpusId": 6033642}, "title": "Financing REDD in developing countries: a supply and demand analysis", "abstract": "Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) in developing countries has been at the centre of negotiations on a renewed international climate regime.

First, global demand for hypothetical REDD credits is estimated. The demand for REDD credits would be highest with a base year of 1990, using gross\u2014net accounting. The key factors determining demand in this scenario are the emission reduction targets and the allowable cap. A proportion of emission reduction targets available for offsets lower than 15% would fail to generate a sufficient demand for REDD. Also examined is the option of financing REDD through a fund. Indirectly linking the replenishment of a REDD fund to the market is a promising mechanism, but its feasibility depends on political will.

While pH, sulphate, acid neutralisation capacity (ANC) and the sum of the base cations (SBC) of all lakes have been significantly affected by acid deposition, water chemistry conditions are now considerably better than they were in 1975, at the worst of the deposition.

A static, single period, multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the Thai economy has been developed for this purpose. This study finds that the selection of a tax instrument to reduce CO, emissions would be significantly influenced by the scheme to recycle the tax revenue to the economy. If the tax revenue is recycled to finance cuts in the existing labour or indirect tax rates, carbon tax would be more efficient than the sulphur-, energy- and output-taxes to reduce CO2 emissions. On the other hand, if the tax revenue is recycled to households through a lump-sum transfer, sulphur and carbon taxes would be more efficient than energy and output taxes. The ranking between the sulphur and carbon taxes under the lump sum transfer scheme depends on substitution possibility of fossil fuels. Sulphur tax is found superior over carbon tax at the higher substitution possibility between fossil fuels; the reverse is found true at the lower substitution possibility. In all schemes of revenue recycling considered, the output tax is found to be the most costly (i.e., in welfare terms) despite the fact that it generates two to three times higher revenue than the other tax instruments.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "40f92c5c0219413ddb8617277ca77601fd5bed27", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2901819184", "DOI": "10.1007/s11356-018-3792-2", "CorpusId": 53725200, "PubMed": "30474811"}, "title": "Producing more grain yield of rice with less ammonia volatilization and greenhouse gases emission using slow/controlled-release urea", "abstract": "Ammonia (NH3) volatilization and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from rice (Oryza sativa L.) fields contaminate the atmospheric environment and lead to global warming.

Canopy emissions of volatile hydrocarbons such as isoprene and monoterpenes play an important role in air chemistry. They depend on various environmental conditions, are highly species-specific and are expected to be affected by global change. In order to estimate future emissions of these isoprenoids, differently complex models are available. However, seasonal dynamics driven by phenology, enzymatic activity, or drought stress strongly modify annual ecosystem emissions. Although these impacts depend themselves on environmental conditions, they have yet received little attention in mechanistic modelling. In this paper we propose the application of a mechanistic method for considering the seasonal dynamics of emission potential using the \"Seasonal Isoprenoid synthase Model\" (Lehning et al., 2001). We test this approach with three different models (GUENTHER, Guenther et al., 1993; NIINEMETS, Niinemets et al., 2002a; BIM2, Grote et al., 2006) that are developed for simulating light-dependent monoterpene emission. We also suggest specific drought stress representations for each model. Additionally, the proposed model developments are compared with the approach realized in the MEGAN (Guenther et al., 2006) emission model. Models are applied to a Mediterranean Holm oak (Quercus ilex) site with measured weather data. The simulation results demonstrate that the consideration of a dynamic emission potential has a strong effect on annual monoterpene emission estimates. The investigated models, however, show different sensitivities to the procedure for determining this seasonality impact. Considering a drought impact reduced the differences between the applied models and decreased emissions at the investigation site by approximately 33% on average over a 10 year period. Although this overall reduction was similar in all models, the sensitivity to weather conditions in specific years was different. We conclude that the proposed implementations of drought stress and internal seasonality strongly reduce estimated emissions and indicate the measurements that are needed to further evaluate the models.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "07154a27dd518a309f3ad4af9991a47b6e9bc673", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2079512498", "DOI": "10.1039/C1JM10857C", "CorpusId": 96736021}, "title": "Nanostructured cathode materials: a key for better performance in Li-ion batteries", "abstract": "Battery technology plays critical role under clean energy systems because it contributes for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

Soils are important sources and sinks of both potent greenhouse gases where their production and consumption are largely regulated by biological processes. Climate change could alter these processes thereby affecting both rate and direction of their exchange with the atmosphere. We examined how a rise in atmospheric CO2 and temperature affected CH4 and N2O fluxes in a well\u2010drained upland soil (volumetric water content ranging between 6% and 23%) in a semiarid grassland during five growing seasons. We hypothesized that responses of CH4 and N2O fluxes to elevated CO2 and warming would be driven primarily by treatment effects on soil moisture. Previously we showed that elevated CO2 increased and warming decreased soil moisture in this grassland. We therefore expected that elevated CO2 and warming would have opposing effects on CH4 and N2O fluxes. Methane was taken up throughout the growing season in all 5 years. A bell\u2010shaped relationship was observed with soil moisture with highest CH4 uptake at intermediate soil moisture. Both N2O emission and uptake occurred at our site with some years showing cumulative N2O emission and other years showing cumulative N2O uptake. Nitrous oxide exchange switched from net uptake to net emission with increasing soil moisture. In contrast to our hypothesis, both elevated CO2 and warming reduced the sink of CH4 and N2O expressed in CO2 equivalents (across 5 years by 7% and 11% for elevated CO2 and warming respectively) suggesting that soil moisture changes were not solely responsible for this reduction.

Yet, the chief method for climate changemitigation, the reduction of fossil fuel use, would also reduce particulate air pollution, which is implicated in over three million deaths worldwide each year (Lim et al. 2013). Indeed, in the US, improved public health ranks among the top perceived benefits of reducing fossil fuel use (Leiserowitz et al. 2013), and the scientific community has been promoting these benefits\u2014such as reduction in hospitalizations and premature deaths \u2014for over a decade (Cifuentes et al. 2001; West et al. 2013). Furthermore, the health behavior literature demonstrates that personal perception of risk, which is likely to be linked to health, is one of the strongest motivators of behavioral change (Few 2007; Maibach and Parrott 1995). Thus, one possible method for garnering support for carbon emissions reduction is to emphasize the added co-benefit of reducing present-day, health-related impacts. However, it remains to be understood whether public health messaging can lead to improved climate change mitigation efforts, or how specific segments of the US population will respond to this message. In particular, emphasizing health co-benefits may be a strong motivator of attitude change among individuals who are less concerned about environmental threats or who deny the existence of anthropogenic climate change.

We find that the cooling effect of surface albedo modification is strongly seasonal and mostly confined to the areas of application. For urban and cropland geoengineering, the global effects are minor but, because of being colocated with areas of human activity, they may provide some regional benefits. Global desert geoengineering, which is associated with significant global-scale changes in circulation and the hydrological cycle, causes a smaller reduction in global precipitation per degree of cooling than sunshade geoengineering, 1.1% K\u22121 and 2.0% K\u22121 respectively, but a far greater reduction in the precipitation over land, 3.9% K\u22121 compared with 1.0% K\u22121.

This paper investigates the profit distribution model of a two-echelon construction supply chain consisting of a general contractor and a subcontractor with cap-and-trade policy. Using game theory and Shapley value method, the optimal emission reduction decisions and profit distribution under three cooperation modes of pure competition, co-opetition, and pure cooperation are obtained, respectively. The research shows that the profits of the construction supply chain are increasing in pure competition, co-opetition, and pure cooperation scenarios, and the emission reduction amount of the construction supply chain in the case of pure cooperation is greater than that of pure competition and co-opetition. The carbon emission reduction amount under the co-opetition scenario is not always greater than that under the pure competition scenario, which depends on the emission reduction cost coefficient relationship of general contractor and subcontractor. When the cost coefficient of emission reduction of the general contractor is less than that of the subcontractor, the emission reduction amount under pure competition is larger than that under co-opetition.

It is well known that the urea-based SCR system is promising to remove engine-out NOx emissions and achieve strict legislative emission regulations. However, if the urea is overdosed, the system also leads to ammonia slip in the tailpipe. In order to control the NOx emissions and constrain the ammonia slip, a feedback loop with NOx and ammonia sensors may be needed. An interesting phenomenon in the closed loop is that a well calibrated NOx sensor does not work well in the urea-based SCR systems. For this typical application, there may be several sources for the NOx sensor reading mismatching issues. Due to the existence of the gaseous ammonia, the NOx sensor reading is approximately a combination of the actual NOx concentration and the ammonia concentration. Another phenomenon is that the influence of the ammonia concentration to the NOx sensor reading is significantly different with respect to different temperatures. Based on such observations and the importance of the NOx concentration reading, we devote to develop an algorithm to correct the NOx sensor reading. With considerable experimental data which cover most of the typical SCR operating temperature range, we obtain the relationship between the cross-sensitivity factor and the temperature by employing the adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).

The two main geoengineering options are limiting incoming solar radiation, or modifying the carbon cycle. Here we examine the impact of five geoengineering approaches on sea level; SO2 aerosol injection into the stratosphere, mirrors in space, afforestation, biochar, and bioenergy with carbon sequestration. Sea level responds mainly at centennial time scales to temperature change, and has been largely driven by anthropogenic forcing since 1850. Making use a model of sea-level rise as a function of time-varying climate forcing factors (solar radiation, volcanism, and greenhouse gas emissions) we find that sea-level rise by 2100 will likely be 30 cm higher than 2000 levels despite all but the most aggressive geoengineering under all except the most stringent greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. The least risky and most desirable way of limiting sea-level rise is bioenergy with carbon sequestration. However aerosol injection or a space mirror system reducing insolation at an accelerating rate of 1 W m-2 per decade from now to 2100 could limit or reduce sea levels. Aerosol injection delivering a constant 4 W m-2 reduction in radiative forcing (similar to a 1991 Pinatubo eruption every 18 months) could delay sea-level rise by 40\u201380 years.

These materials are cheap, available near large point sources of CO2, and tend to react relatively rapidly with CO2 due to their chemical instability. Ground steel slag was carbonated in aqueous suspensions to study its reaction mechanisms. Process variables, such as particle size, temperature, carbon dioxide pressure, and reaction time, were systematically varied, and their influence on the carbonation rate was investigated. The maximum carbonation degree reached was 74% of the Ca content in 30 min at 19 bar CO2 pressure, 100 degrees C, and a particle size of <38 microm. The two most important factors determining the reaction rate are particle size (<2 mm to <38 microm) and reaction temperature (25-225 degrees C). The carbonation reaction was found to occur in two steps: (1) leaching of calcium from the steel slag particles into the solution; (2) precipitation of calcite on the surface of these particles. The first step and, more in particular, the diffusion of calcium through the solid matrix toward the surface appeared to be the rate-determining reaction step. The Ca diffusion was found to be hindered by the formation of a CaCO3-coating and a Ca-depleted silicate zone during the carbonation process.
