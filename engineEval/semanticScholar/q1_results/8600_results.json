These \u201ccarrots\u201d are intended to encourage the initial diffusion of new, greenhouse-gas-emissions-reducing technologies, in contrast to carbon taxes and emissions trading which provide a \u201cstick\u201d designed to reduce emissions by increasing the price of high-emitting technologies for all users. Technology incentives appear attractive, but their record in practice is mixed and economic theory suggests that in the absence of market failures, they are inefficient compared to taxes and trading. This study uses an agent-based model of technology diffusion and exploratory modeling, a new technique for decision-making under conditions of extreme uncertainty, to examine the conditions under which technology incentives should be a key building block of robust climate change policies. We find that a combined strategy of carbon taxes and technology incentives, as opposed to carbon taxes alone, is the best approach to greenhouse gas emissions reductions if the social benefits of early adoption sufficiently exceed the private benefits. Such social benefits can occur when economic actors have a wide variety of cost/performance preferences for new technologies and either new technologies have increasing returns to scale or potential adopters can reduce their uncertainty about the performance of new technologies by querying the experience of other adopters. We find that if decision-makers hold even modest expectations that such social benefits are significant or that the impacts of climate change will turn out to be serious then technology incentive programs may be a promising hedge against the threat of climate change.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "3880d667bcdb7f54c6c95ccc2cd96800dd85548d", "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "1002.4391", "MAG": "2155818417", "DOI": "10.1051/0004-6361/200913725", "CorpusId": 43455849}, "title": "Chromospheric activity and rotation of FGK stars in the solar vicinity - An estimation of the radial velocity jitter", "abstract": "Context. Chromospheric activity produces both photometric and spectroscopic variations that can be mistaken as planets. Large spots crossing the stellar disc can produce planet-like periodic variations in the light curve of a star. These spots clearly affect the spectral line profiles, and their perturbations alter the line centroids creating a radial velocity jitter that might \u201ccontaminate\u201d the variations induced by a planet. Precise chromospheric activity measurements are needed to estimate the activity-induced noise that should be expected for a given star. \nAims. We obtain precise chromospheric activity measurements and projected rotational velocities for nearby (d \u2264 25 pc) cool (spectral types F to K) stars, to estimate their expected activity-related jitter. As a complementary objective, we attempt to obtain relationships between fluxes in different activity indicator lines, that permit a transformation of traditional activity indicators, i.e., Ca II H & K lines, to others that hold noteworthy advantages. \nMethods. We used high resolution (~50\u2009000) echelle optical spectra. Standard data reduction was performed using the IRAF ECHELLE package. To determine the chromospheric emission of the stars in the sample, we used the spectral subtraction technique. We measured the equivalent widths of the chromospheric emission lines in the subtracted spectrum and transformed them into fluxes by applying empirical equivalent width and flux relationships. Rotational velocities were determined using the cross-correlation technique. To infer activity-related radial velocity (RV) jitter, we used empirical relationships between this jitter and the R\u2019_HK index. \nResults. We measured chromospheric activity, as given by different indicators throughout the optical spectra, and projected rotational velocities for 371 nearby cool stars. We have built empirical relationships among the most important chromospheric emission lines. Finally, we used the measured chromospheric activity to estimate the expected RV jitter for the active stars in the sample.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "6c415519962b43a383c306bb65488dbb1621025d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2476554303", "DOI": "10.3390/EN9080599", "CorpusId": 10976705}, "title": "On-Site Measurements of CO 2 Emissions during the Construction Phase of a Building Complex", "abstract": "This study describes the environmental impact of the material production, transportation, and construction phases from the construction site perspective.

Generally, the oil and electric energy consumed during the construction was evaluated by direct monitoring. Through the construction period and cost according to work type, a correlation with CO 2 emissions was also investigated. In addition, CO 2 emissions were examined through the system capacity and gross floor area for each work type. The calculations have shown that CO 2 emissions from the material production phase constitute 93.4% of the total CO 2 emissions. In addition, CO 2 emissions from the material transportation and on-site construction account for 2.4% and 4.2% of the total CO 2 emissions, respectively.

In the present study, a reaction model of the carbon iron ore composite based on a lumped system is proposed to analyze the reduction behavior in the blast furnace. This model is composed of several reaction steps between carbon, iron ore, and gas phase. The carbon solution loss reaction rate of the small particles of reducing agents is determined by the thermogravimetric method. It is found that the gasification of reducing agents is the rate-determining step in the reduction of the carbon iron ore composite. Accordingly, the particle size and reactivity of reducing agents such as coke have an influence on the reduction rate of the carbon iron ore composite. The influence of the gas composition in the atmosphere around the composite on the reduction is analyzed by using the reaction model.

Thus, there is a need to identify the key factors affecting the climate effects of natural gas versus coal electricity production, and to present these climate effects in as clear and transparent a way as possible. Here, we identify power plant efficiencies and methane leakage rates as the factors that explain most of the variance in greenhouse gas emissions by natural gas and coal power plants. Thus, we focus on the role of these factors in determining the relative merits of natural gas versus coal power plants. We develop a simple model estimating CO2 and CH4 emissions from natural gas and coal power plants, and resulting temperature change. Simple underlying physical changes can be obscured by abstract evaluation metrics, thus we focus our analysis on the time evolution of global mean temperature. We find that, during the period of plant operation, if there is substantial methane leakage, natural gas plants can produce greater near-term warming than coal plants with the same power output. However, if methane leakage rates are low and power plant efficiency is high, natural gas plants can produce some reduction in near-term warming. In the long term, natural gas power plants produce less warming than would occur with coal power plants. However, without carbon capture and storage natural gas power plants cannot achieve the deep reductions that would be required to avoid substantial contribution to additional global warming.

However, when compared to the rest of the world, emissions abatement in the US comes disproportionately from agriculture, and, within agriculture, disproportionately from reductions in fertilizer-related emissions (primarily in maize production). In the world as a whole, agriculture-related mitigation comes predominantly in reduced methane emissions from ruminant livestock, which is followed in relative importance by reductions in methane emissions from paddy rice. We also find significant linkages between emissions in one region and mitigation in another (i.e. leakage).

Cost analyses are important tools to do this. Data published previously on these topics reflect assumptions that are no longer valid. The aim of this study was to determine the cost of developing and operating a PET facility and to evaluate whether a regional cyclotron serving several scanners reduces costs.\n\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nFinancial data were collected on capital expense and global operating costs through interviews with industry experts, evaluation of prior studies, and review of expenses incurred at the University of Southern California PET center. A data model and cost templates were developed. Expenses were allocated either to the production or purchase of radiopharmaceuticals or to the provision of the PET scan, and the cost per procedure was determined. A sensitivity analysis was performed on the net present value for key parameters.\n\n\nRESULTS\nA cyclotron serving a single scanner is not financially viable. The radiopharmaceutical distribution configurations were financially sound. In these cases, the cost of the radiopharmaceutical was approximately $700 per dose with modest levels of production (12 doses per day).

The 3\u201311 keV spectrum exhibits a moderately steep power-law continuum, with a broad emission line at \u223c6.7 keV, probably blended with a narrow line at \u223c6.4 keV, and a broad absorption trough above \u223c8.7 keV. We identify both broad spectral features with reprocessing in He-like Fe. An earlier XMM\u2013Newton observation of Mrk 766 in 2000 May, when the source was a factor \u223c2 fainter, shows a similar broad emission line, but with a slightly flatter power law and absorption at a lower energy. In neither observation do we find a requirement for the previously reported broad \u2018red wing\u2019 to the line and hence of reflection from the innermost accretion disc. More detailed examination of the longer XMM\u2013Newton observation reveals evidence for rapid spectral variability in the Fe K band, apparently linked with the occurrence of X-ray \u2018flares\u2019. A reduction in the emission line strength and increased high-energy absorption during the X-ray flaring suggests that these transient effects are due to highly ionized ejecta associated with the flares. Simple scaling from the flare avalanche model proposed for the luminous quasi-stellar object PDS 456 confirms the feasibility of coherent flaring being the cause of the strong peaks seen in the X-ray light curve of Mrk 766.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "65a8e9d2ebf7aefa1f030414741a0cf30ee28b7c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2285338224", "DOI": "10.2172/755350", "CorpusId": 101532274}, "title": "Diesel Emission Control -- Sulfur Effects (DECSE) Program; Phase I Interim Date Report No. 3: Diesel Fuel Sulfur Effects on Particulate Matter Emissions", "abstract": "The Diesel Emission Control-Sulfur Effects (DECSE) is a joint government/industry program to determine the impact of diesel fuel sulfur levels on emission control systems whose use could lower emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO{sub x}) and particulate matter (PM) from on-highway trucks in the 2002--2004 model years.

We spatially related the firescars to land cover types and defined the C fractions of aboveground biomass and the ground layer (referring to the top 15 cm organic soil layer only in this paper) consumed in association with land cover types, soil drainage classes, and the C stocks in the ground layer.ResultsThe fires led to a burned area of 26,500 km2 and resulted in the total C emission of 81.1 \u00b1 13.6 Tg (Tg, Teragram; 1 Tg = 1012 g) or 3.1 \u00b1 0.7 kg C m-2 burned. Of the total C emission, about 73% and 27% could be attributed to the consumption of the ground layer and aboveground biomass, respectively.ConclusionThe predominant contribution of the ground layer to the total C emission implies the importance of ground fuel management to the control of wildfires and mitigation of C emissions. The magnitude of the total C emission depends on fire extent, while the C loss in kg C m-2 burned is affected strongly by the ground layer and soil drainage condition.

The paper also highlights the potentials of GHG reduction by implementing energy efficiency in the building sector. Malaysia's total demand of energy increased from 1,244 Petajoules (PJ) in 2000 to 1,631.7 PJ in 2005. Commercial and residential buildings, alone, account for about 13% of total energy consumption and 48% of electricity consumption. The escalating consumption of energy that heavily relied on fossil fuels had resultant significant increment in emission of GHG (mainly carbon dioxide) from the sector. Over the years, GHG emissions have been increasing in Malaysia. In 2000, the total CO2 emission from energy sector is 118,806 kilotonne. Per capita emission rose from 4.21 tonnes in 1994 to 6.29 tonnes in 2001. A significant share of these emissions can be avoided cost effectively through improved energy efficiency, while providing the same or higher level of energy services. In this regard, greater use of energy efficient technologies or options and behavioral changes can substantially reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the building sector.

At present, among the obstacles that this technology encounters, odor control and biogas utilization or disposal should be properly addressed. In fact, in most of small and medium size anaerobic municipal treatment plants, biogas is just vented, transferring pollution from water to the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse gas inventory. Anaerobic municipal sewage treatment should not be considered as an energy producer, unless a significant wastewater flow is treated. In these cases, more than half of the methane produced is dissolved and lost in the effluent so yield values will be between 0.08 and 0.18\u00a0N m3 CH4/kg COD removed. Diverse technologies for odor control and biogas cleaning are currently available. High pollutant concentrations may be treated with physical-chemical methods, while biological processes are used mainly for odor control to prevent negative impacts on the treatment facilities or nearby areas. In general terms, biogas treatment is accomplished by physico-chemical methods, scrubbing being extensively used for H2S and CO2 removal. However, dilution (venting) has been an extensive disposal method in some small- and medium-size anaerobic plants treating municipal wastewaters. Simple technologies, such as biofilters, should be developed in order to avoid this practice, matching with the simplicity of anaerobic wastewater treatment processes. In any case, design and specification of biogas handling system should consider safety standards. Resource recovery can be added to anaerobic sewage treatment if methane is used as electron donor for denitrification and nitrogen control purposes. This would result in a reduction of operational cost and in an additional advantage for the application of anaerobic sewage treatment.

Isoprene emission rates per unit dry leaf mass were 44% lower for actively symptomatic leaves than for leaves on healthy trees (P = 0.033). Isoprene fluxes were significantly negatively correlated with rankings of disease activity in the host tree (fluxes in leaves on healthy trees > healthy leaves on survivor trees > healthy leaves on the same branch as symptomatic leaves > symptomatic leaves; isoprene per unit dry mass: Spearman's rho = -0.781, P = 0.001; isoprene per unit leaf area: Spearman's rho = -0.652, P = 0.008). Photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were reduced by 57 and 63%, respectively, in symptomatic relative to healthy leaves (P < 0.05); these reductions were proportionally greater than the reductions in isoprene emissions. Low isoprene emission rates in symptomatic leaves are most simply explained by physiological constraints on isoprene production, such as water stress as a result of xylem blockage, rather than direct effects of the oak wilt fungus on isoprene synthesis. The effects of oak wilt on leaf-level isoprene emission rates are probably less important for regional isoprene fluxes than the reduction in oak leaf area across landscapes.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "50c1e0b11987bf9c68a69cf51741ccb8781edd02", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2592714512", "ArXiv": "astro-ph/0610382", "DOI": "10.1007/s10509-007-9326-x", "CorpusId": 14531982}, "title": "Resonant Compton upscattering in anomalous X-ray pulsars", "abstract": "Abstract\nA significant new development in the study of Anomalous X-ray Pulsars (AXPs) has been the recent discovery by INTEGRAL and RXTE of flat, hard X-ray components in three AXPs. These non-thermal spectral components differ dramatically from the steeper quasi-power-law tails seen in the classic X-ray band in these sources. A prime candidate mechanism for generating this new component is resonant, magnetic Compton upscattering. This process is very efficient in the strong magnetic fields present in AXPs. Here an introductory exploration of an inner magnetospheric model for upscattering of surface thermal X-rays in AXPs is offered, preparing the way for an investigation of whether such resonant upscattering can explain the 20\u2013150\u00a0keV spectra seen by INTEGRAL. Characteristically flat emission spectra produced by non-thermal electrons injected in the emission region are computed using collision integrals. A relativistic QED scattering cross section is employed so that Klein\u2013Nishina reductions are influential in determining the photon spectra and fluxes.

To improve the fuel performance of engines, combustor temperatures and pressures often increase, increasing NO x emissions. Conversely, combustor modifications to reduce NO x may increase CO2. Hence, a technology trade-off exists, which also translates to a trade-off between short-lived climate forcers and a long-lived greenhouse gas, CO2. Moreover, the NO x-O3-CH4 system responds in a nonlinear manner, according to both aviation emissions and background NO x. A simple climate model was modified to incorporate nonlinearities parametrized from a complex chemistry model. Case studies showed that for a scenario of a 20% reduction in NO x emissions the consequential CO2 penalty of 2% actually increased the total radiative forcing (RF). For a 2% fuel penalty, NO x emissions needed to be reduced by >43% to realize an overall benefit. Conversely, to ensure that the fuel penalty for a 20% NO x emission reduction did not increase overall forcing, a 0.5% increase in CO2 was found to be the \"break even\" point. The time scales of the climate effects of NO x and CO2 are quite different, necessitating careful analysis of proposed emissions trade-offs.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "88da8648424d63ac55eb2e42414c770aff57ae4b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2750743778", "DOI": "10.1002/cssc.201701275", "CorpusId": 19819133, "PubMed": "28868763"}, "title": "Cascade Reductive Etherification of Bioderived Aldehydes over Zr-Based Catalysts.", "abstract": "An efficient one-pot catalytic cascade sequence has been developed for the production of value-added ethers from bioderived aldehydes.

Experimental Design: Seventy-six female patients (mean age, 55.7 years; range, 25\u201386 years) with an imaging abnormality (BI-RADS 0, 4\u20135) were included in this Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved study. Patients underwent fused PET-MRI of the breast with 18FDG-PET/CT and MP MRI at 3T. The likelihood of malignancy was assessed for all single parameters, for MP MRI with two/three parameters, and for MP 18FDG PET-MRI. Histopathology was used as the standard of reference. Appropriate statistical tests were used to assess sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy for each assessment combination. Results: There were 53 malignant and 23 benign breast lesions. MP 18FDG PET-MRI yielded a significantly higher area under the cure (AUC) of 0.935 than DCE-MRI (AUC, 0.86; P = 0.044) and the combination of DCE-MRI and another parameter (AUC, 0.761\u20130.826; P = 0.013\u20130.020). MP 18FDG PET-MRI showed slight further improvement to MP MRI with three parameters (AUC, 0.925; P = 0.317).

Here we estimate methane emissions from glacial wetlands, using newly available PMIP2 simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate from coupled atmosphere-ocean and atmosphere-ocean-vegetation models. These simulations apply improved boundary conditions resulting in better agreement with paleoclimatic data than earlier PMIP1 simulations. Emissions are computed from the dominant controls of water table depth, soil temperature, and plant productivity, and we analyze the relative role of each factor in the glacial decline. It is found that latitudinal changes in soil moisture, in combination with ice sheet expansion, cause boreal wetlands to shift southward in all simulations. This southward migration is instrumental in maintaining the boreal wetland source at a significant level. The mean emission temperature over boreal wetlands drops by only a few degrees, despite the strong overall cooling. The temperature effect on the glacial decline in the methane flux is therefore moderate, while reduced plant productivity contributes equally to the total reduction. Model results indicate a relatively small boreal and large tropical source during the LGM, with wetlands on the exposed continental shelves mainly contributing to the tropical source.

The ability to target NH3 slip is important not only to minimize urea consumption, but also to reduce this unregulated emission. Being able to discriminate between NO and NO2 is important for two reasons. First, recent Fe-zeolite catalyst studies suggest that NOx reduction is highly favored by the NO2 based reactions. Second, NO2 is more toxic than NO to both the environment and human health. The estimator and control law are based on a 4-state model of the urea-SCR plant. A linearized version of the model is used for state estimation while the full nonlinear model is used for control design. An experimentally validated, higher order simulation is used to evaluate the performance of the closed loop system.

The ecological status of the Baltic Sea has for many years been affected by the high input of both waterborne and airborne nutrients. The focus here is on the airborne input of nitrogen (N) and the projected changes in this input, assuming the new National Emission Ceilings directive (NEC-II), currently under negotiation in the EU, is fulfilled towards the year 2020. With a set of scenario simulations, the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) has been used to estimate the development in nitrogen deposition based on present day meteorology combined with present day (2007) or future (2020) anthropogenic emissions. Applying a so-called tagging method in the DEHM model, the contribution from ship traffic and from each of the nine countries with coastlines to the Baltic Sea has been assessed. The annual deposition to the Baltic Sea is estimated to 203 k tonnes N for the present day scenario (2007) and 165 k tonnes N in the 2020 scenario, giving a projected reduction of 38 k tonnes N in the annual load in 2020. This equals a decline in nitrogen deposition of 19%. The results from 20 model runs using the tagging method show that of the total nitrogen deposition in 2007, 52% came from emissions within the bordering countries. By 2020, this is projected to decrease to 48%.

Climate-induced drought events have a significant influence on sulphate export from forested catchments in central Ontario, subsequently delaying the recovery of surface waters from acidification. In the current study, a model chain that employed a statistical downscaling model, a hydrological model and two hydrochemical models was used to forecast the chemical recovery of Plastic Lake sub-catchment 1 (PC1) from acidification under proposed deposition reductions and the A2 emission scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Any predicted recovery in stream acid neutralising capacity and pH owing to deposition reductions were clearly offset by large acid effluxes from climate-induced drought events. By 2100, ANC is predicted to show large variations ranging between 10 and \u221230 \u03bcmolc L\u22121. Similarly, predicted pH in 2100 is lower (>0.05 of a pH unit) than the value simulated for 2000 (pH 4.35). Despite emission reductions, the future scenario paints a bleak picture of reacidification at PC1 to levels commensurate with those of the late 1970s. The principal process behind this reacidification is the oxidation of previously stored (reduced) sulphur compounds in wetlands during periods of low-flow (or drought), with subsequent efflux of sulphate upon re-wetting. Simulated catchment runoff under the A2 emissions scenario predictes increased intensity and frequency of low-flow events from approximately 2030 onwards. The Integrated Catchments model for Carbon indicated that stream DOC concentrations at PC1 will also increase under the future climate scenario, with temperature being the principal driver. Despite the predicted (significant) increase in DOC, pH is not predicted to further decline (beyond the climate-induced oxidation scenario), instead pH shows greater variability throughout the simulation.

We used the integrated assessment model MESSAGE to compare emission pathways and abatement costs for fixed and time-dependent variants of the Global Temperature Change Potential (GTP) with those based on GWPs, for a policy goal of limiting the radiative forcing to a specified level in the year 2100. We find that fixed 100-year GTPs would increase global abatement costs (discounted and aggregated over the 21st century) under this policy goal by 5\u201320\u00a0% relative to 100-year GWPs, whereas time-varying GTPs would reduce costs by about 5\u00a0%. These cost differences are smaller than differences arising from alternative assumptions regarding agricultural mitigation potential and much smaller than those arising from alternative radiative forcing targets. Using the land-use model GLOBIOM, we show that alternative metrics affect food production differently in different world regions depending on regional characteristics of future land-use change to meet growing food demand.

The model was developed as a minimum cost diet model. Two types of environmental policies were examined: a tax and a constraint on methane emissions. A tax was incorporated to simulate a greenhouse gas emissions tax policy, and prices of carbon credits in the current carbon markets were attributed to the methane production variable. Three independent runs were made, using carbon dioxide equivalent prices of $5, $17, and $250/t. A constraint was incorporated into the model to simulate the second type of environmental policy, reducing methane emissions by predetermined amounts. The linear programming formulation of this second alternative enabled the calculation of marginal costs of reducing methane emissions. Methane emission and manure production by dairy cows were calculated according to published equations, and nitrogen and mineral excretions were calculated by mass conservation laws. Results were compared with respect to the values generated by a base least-cost model. Current prices of the carbon credit market did not appear onerous enough to have a substantive incentive effect in reducing methane emissions and altering diet costs of our hypothetical dairy herd. However, when emissions of methane were assumed to be reduced by 5, 10, and 13.5% from the base model, total diet costs increased by 5, 19.1, and 48.5%, respectively. Either these increased costs would be passed onto the consumer or dairy producers would go out of business. Nitrogen and potassium excretions were increased by 16.5 and 16.7% with a 13.5% reduction in methane emissions from the base model. Imposing methane restrictions would further increase the demand for grains and other human-edible crops, which is not a progressive solution for an industry trying to be sustainable. However, these results might depend on the constraints and inputs used in our model (e.g., feed prices), and more extensive analyses are required before they are used in policy development.

Here, we report the fabrication of novel nitrogen-doped coreshell-structured porous Fe/Fe 3 C@C nanoboxes supported on RGO sheets (N-doped Fe/Fe 3 C@C/RGO) by a simple pyrolysis process using graphene oxide (GO) and PB nanocubes as precursors. Such a unique structure not only offers more active sites from both nitrogen-doped Fe/Fe 3 C@C and NRGO sheets, but also shows enhanced electrical conductivity. As a result, the hybrid exhibits much better electrocatalytic activity, long-term stability, and methanol tolerance ability than the commercial Pt/C catalyst (10% Pt on Vulcan XC-72). The fabrication process for the porous N-doped Fe/Fe 3 C@C/ RGO hybrid is demonstrated in Figure 1 a. Highly uniform PB nanocubes were fi rstly synthesized using a hydrothermal method based on previous reports. [ 9a ] The obtained PB nanocubes were further dispersed in the GO solution (PB/GO) under stirring. The resulting PB/GO powders after drying at 80 \u00b0C were then annealed at 800 \u00b0C in an argon fl ow to form a core-shell-structured porous N-doped Fe/Fe 3 C@C/RGO hybrid. During this process, the continuous decomposition of PB nanocubes was accompanied by releasing nitrogen-containing gases, [ 11 ] which resulted in the formation of a porous structure accompanied with carbide reactions according to the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Simultaneously, the nitrogen-containing species contributed to the reduction of GO and nitrogen doping in both GO and carbon shells, fi nally evolving into nitrogen-doped core-shell-structured porous Fe/Fe 3 C@C/RGO hybrids. The PB nanocubes not only act as templates/precursors, but also provide nitrogen sources for the formation of N-doped Fe/Fe 3 C@C and NRGO. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images show that uniform PB nanocubes with an edge length of about 500 nm are obtained without any aggregation (Figure 1 b). An enlarged image (inset of Figure 1 b) reveals the very smooth surface over a single box. After the thermal treatment, the PB nanocubes are converted to porous N-doped Fe/Fe 3 C@C nanoboxes with a side length of around 300\u2013400 nm (Figure 1 c). The cubic structure still remained, although its size decreased a little due to the decomposition and shrinkage during the annealing process.

These schemes have been basically applied for large industrial sectors, including energy producers and energy-intensive users. Among them, cement plants are included among the big greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters. The use of waste as secondary fuel in clinker kilns is currently an intensive practice worldwide. However, people living in the vicinity of cement plants, where alternative fuels are being used, are frequently concerned about the potential increase in health risks. In the present study, a cost\u2013benefit analysis was applied after substituting classical fuel for sewage sludge as an alternative fuel in a clinker kiln in Catalonia, Spain.Materials and methodsThe economical benefits resulting in the reduction of CO2 emissions were compared with the changes in human health risks due to exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and carcinogenic metals (As, Cd, Co, and Cr) before and after using sewage sludge to generate 20% of the thermal energy needed for pyro-processing. The exposure to PCDD/Fs and metals through air inhalation, soil ingestion and dermal absorption was calculated according to the environmental levels in soil. The carcinogenic risks were assessed, and the associated cost for the population was estimated by considering the DG Environment\u2019s recommended value for preventing a statistical fatality (VPF). In turn, the amount of CO2 emitted was calculated, and the economical saving, according to the market prices, was evaluated.ResultsThe use of sewage sludge as a substitute of conventional energy meant a probability cancer decrease of 4.60 for metals and a cancer risk increase of 0.04 for PCDD/Fs. Overall, a net reduction of 4.56 cancers for one million people can be estimated. The associated economical evaluation due to the decreasing cancer for 60,000 people, the current population living near the cement plant, would be of 0.56 million euros (US$ 0.83 million). In turn, a reduction of 144,000\u00a0tons of CO2 emitted between 2003 and 2006 was estimated. Considering a cost of 20 euros per ton of CO2, the global saving would be 2.88 million euros (US$ 4.26 million).DiscussionAfter the partial substitution of the fuel, the current environmental exposure to metals and PCDD/Fs would even mean a potential decrease of health risks for the individuals living in the vicinity of the cement plant. The total benefit of using sewage sludge as an alternative fuel was calculated in 3.44 million euros (US$ 5.09 million). Environmental economics is becoming an interesting research field to convert environmental benefits (i.e., reduction of health risks, emission of pollutants, etc.) into economical value.ConclusionsThe results show, that while the use of sewage sludge as secondary fuel is beneficial for the reduction in GHG emissions, no additional health risks for the population derived from PCDD/F and metal emissions are estimated.Recommendations and perspectivesCost\u2013benefit analysis seems to be a suitable tool to estimate the environmental damage and benefit associated to industrial processes. Therefore, this should become a generalized practice, mainly for those more impacting sectors such as power industries.

The effect of there being an influence of the velocity gradient was also found in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. Experimentally, friction forces could be reduced by up to 80%, demonstrating the tremendous potential of laser surface texturing (LST) to lower friction forces and reduce CO2 emissions.", "year": 2015}]}
