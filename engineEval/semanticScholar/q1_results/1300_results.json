To clarify the benefits of vehicle lightweighting we have reviewed the available literature (43 studies). The GHG emissions and primary energy results from 33 studies that passed a screening process were harmonized using a common set of assumptions (lifetime distance traveled, fuel-mass coefficient, secondary weight reduction factor, fuel consumption allocation, recycling rate, and energy intensity of materials). After harmonization, all studies indicate that using aluminum, glass-fiber reinforced plastic, and high strength steel to replace conventional steel decreases the vehicle life cycle energy use and GHG emissions.

This is primarily due to factor substitution within the integrated steel mills in the industrialized countries, and to some extent a shift between steel making technologies.

The top provincial emitter is Shandong where plants are densely concentrated. The average NOx-intensity is estimated at 2.28 g/kWh, markedly higher than that of developed countries, mainly owing to the inadequate application of high-efficiency denitrification devices such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR).

This study determines the relative life cycle benefits of two precursor types (conventional textile-type acrylic fibers and renewable-based lignin), part manufacturing technologies (conventional SMC and P4), and a fiber recycling technology.Materials and methodsA representative automotive part, i.e., a 30.8-kg steel floor pan having a 17% weight reduction potential with stringent crash performance requirements, has been considered for the life cycle energy and emissions analysis. Four scenarios\u2014combinations of the precursor types and manufacturing technologies\u2014are compared to the stamped steel baseline part.Results and discussionThe analysis finds the lignin-based part made through P4 technology to offer the greatest life cycle energy and CO2 emissions benefits. Carbon fiber production is estimated to be about 14 times more energy-intensive than conventional steel production; however, life cycle primary energy use is estimated to be quite similar to the conventional part, i.e., 18,500\u00a0MJ/part, especially when considering the uncertainty in LCI data that exist from using numerous sources in the literature.ConclusionsThe sensitivity analysis concludes that with a 20% reduction in energy use in the conversion of lignin to carbon fiber and no energy use incurred in lignin production since lignin is a by-product of ethanol and paper production, a 30% reduction in life cycle energy use could be obtained. A similar level of life cycle energy savings could also be obtained with a higher part weight reduction potential of 43%.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "99157750566c313505f27042664c71ebe815f906", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2024873245", "DOI": "10.1016/J.APENERGY.2015.04.034", "CorpusId": 109223827}, "title": "Measurement and decomposition of energy-saving and emissions reduction performance in Chinese cities", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "38295747e17b0155b439d1ff17aa0796fcd7b896", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2055847217", "DOI": "10.1021/es401034z", "CorpusId": 6515095, "PubMed": "23915291"}, "title": "Long-term trends in motor vehicle emissions in u.s. urban areas.", "abstract": "A fuel-based approach is used to estimate long-term trends (1990-2010) in carbon monoxide (CO) emissions from motor vehicles.

Methane controls produce ozone reductions that are widespread globally and are realized gradually (approximately 12 yr).

The sensitivity of ozone production to precursor emissions was investigated under five different meteorological conditions in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) during the MCMA-2006/MILAGRO field campaign using the gridded photochemical model CAMx driven by observation-nudged WRF meteorology. Precursor emissions were constrained by the comprehensive data from the field campaign and the routine ambient air quality monitoring network. Simulated plume mixing and transport were examined by comparing with measurements from the G-1 aircraft during the campaign. The observed concentrations of ozone precursors and ozone were reasonably well reproduced by the model. The effects of reducing precursor emissions on urban ozone production were performed for three representative emission control scenarios. A 50% reduction in VOC emissions led to 7 to 22 ppb decrease in daily maximum ozone concentrations, while a 50% reduction in NOx emissions leads to 4 to 21 ppb increase, and 50% reductions in both NOx and VOC emission decrease the daily maximum ozone concentrations up to 10 ppb. These results along with a chemical indicator analysis using the chemical production ratios of H2O2 to HNO3 demonstrate that the MCMA urban core region is VOC-limited for all meteorological episodes, which is consistent with the results from MCMA-2003 field campaign; however the degree of the VOC-sensitivity is higher during MCMA-2006 due to lower VOCs, lower VOC reactivity and moderately higher NOx emissions. Ozone formation in the surrounding mountain/rural area is mostly NOx-limited, but can be VOC-limited, and the range of the NOx-limited or VOC-limited areas depends on meteorology.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "a96eef6565f43ff2638e07504562758887258193", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1998296416", "DOI": "10.3763/cpol.2008.0518", "CorpusId": 153479276}, "title": "The effectiveness of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme", "abstract": "How effective is the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) in promoting emissions reduction for compliance with the Kyoto Protocol commitment?

We quantify the temporal trends and spatial patterns of migration to cities and evaluate their associated pollutant emissions from RTC and subsequent health impact from 1980 to 2030. We show that, despite increased urban RTC emissions due to migration, the net effect of migration in China has been a reduction of PM2.5 exposure, primarily because of an unequal distribution of RTC energy mixes between urban and rural areas. After migration, people have switched to cleaner fuel types, which considerably lessened regional emissions. Consequently, the national average PM2.5 exposure concentration in 2010 was reduced by 3.9 \u03bcg/m3 (90% confidence interval, 3.0 to 5.4 \u03bcg/m3) due to migration, corresponding to an annual reduction of 36,000 (19,000 to 47,000) premature deaths.

The paper sets out an analytical framework to answer these questions. After a literature review on the estimates of the co-benefits, new estimates, which are obtained within a general equilibrium, dynamic, multi-regional framework, are presented. The main conclusion is that the co-benefits from climate change mitigation in terms of reduced outdoor local air pollution might cover a significant part of the cost of action. Nonetheless, they alone may not provide sufficient participation incentives to large developing countries. This is partly because direct local air pollution control policies appear to be typically cheaper than indirect action via greenhouse gases emissions mitigation.

They put a price on carbon emissions and make pollution less attractive for regulated firms. However, carbon markets often produce prices which are deemed too low relative to the social cost of carbon. We argue that despite low prices, carbon markets can help reduce emissions. Using a statistical model and sectoral emissions data, we find that the EU ETS, which initially regulated roughly 50% of EU carbon emissions from mainly energy production and large industrial polluters, saved more than 1 billion tons of CO2 between 2008 and 2016. This translates to reductions of 3.8% of total EU-wide emissions compared to a world without the EU ETS. International carbon markets are an appealing and increasingly popular tool to regulate carbon emissions. By putting a price on carbon, carbon markets reshape incentives faced by firms and reduce the value of emissions. How effective are carbon markets? Observers have tended to infer their effectiveness from market prices. The general belief is that a carbon market needs a high price in order to reduce emissions. As a result, many observers remain skeptical of initiatives such as the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), whose price remained low (compared to the social cost of carbon). In this paper, we assess whether the EU ETS reduced CO2 emissions despite low prices. We motivate our study by documenting that a carbon market can be effective if it is a credible institution that can plausibly become more stringent in the future. In such a case, firms might cut emissions even though market prices are low. In fact, low prices can be a signal that the demand for carbon permits weakens. Thus, low prices are compatible with successful carbon markets. To assess whether the EU ETS reduced carbon emissions even as permits were cheap, we estimate counterfactual carbon emissions using an original sectoral emissions dataset. We find that the EU ETS saved about 1.2 billion tons of CO2 between 2008 and 2016 (3.8%) relative to a world without carbon markets, or almost half of what EU governments promised to reduce under their Kyoto Protocol commitments.

Currently there has also been increasing recognition that the urban forms, which refer to the spatial structure of urban land use as well as transport system within a metropolitan area, can have a wide variety of implications for the carbon emissions of a city. However, studies are limited in analyzing quantitatively the impacts of different urban forms on carbon emissions. In this study, we quantify the relationships between urban forms and carbon emissions for the panel of the four fastest-growing cities in China (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou) using time series data from 1990 to 2010. Firstly, the spatial distribution data of urban land use and transportation network in each city are obtained from the land use classification of remote sensing images and the digitization of transportation maps. Then, the urban forms are quantified using a series of spatial metrics which further used as explanatory variables in the estimation. Finally, we implement the panel data analysis to estimate the impacts of urban forms on carbon emission. The results show that, (1) in addition to the growth of urban areas that accelerate the carbon emissions, the increase of fragmentation or irregularity of urban forms could also result in more carbon emissions; (2) a compact development pattern of urban land would help reduce carbon emissions; (3) increases in the coupling degree between urban spatial structure and traffic organization can contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions; (4) urban development with a mononuclear pattern may accelerate carbon emissions.

These data suggest that emissions controls have been effective in reducing particulate concentrations not only in polluted areas but also across the United States. Despite the reduction in elemental carbon, the simultaneous decrease in non-absorbing particles implies that the overall radiative forcing from these changes was toward warming.

The estimated breeding value (EBV) for RFI (RFI(EBV)) for each steer had been calculated from 70-d RFI tests conducted on its parents. Methane production rate (g/d) was measured on each steer using SF(6) as a tracer gas in a series of 10-d measurement periods. Daily DMI of steers was lower during the methane measurement period than when methane was not being measured (11.18 vs. 11.88 kg; P = 0.001).

In the model, we differentiate between leaf morphology (leaf dry mass per area, MA, g m\u22122) altering the content of enzymes of isoprene synthesis pathway per unit leaf area, and biochemical potentials of average leaf cells determining their capacity for isoprene emission. Isoprene emission rate per unit leaf area (\u03bcmol m\u22122 s\u22121) is calculated as the product of MA, the fraction of total electron flow used for isoprene synthesis (\u025b, mol mol\u22121), the rate of photosynthetic electron transport (J) per unit leaf dry mass (Jm, \u03bcmol g\u22121 s\u22121), and the reciprocal of the electron cost of isoprene synthesis [mol isoprene (mol electrons\u22121)]. The initial estimate of electron cost of isoprene synthesis is calculated according to the 1-deoxy- D-xylulose-5-phosphate pathway recently discovered in the chloroplasts, and is further modified to account for extra electron requirements because of photorespiration. The rate of photosynthetic electron transport is calculated by a process-based leaf photosynthesis model. A satisfactory fit to the light-dependence of isoprene emission is obtained using the light response curve of J, and a single value of \u025b, that is dependent on the isoprene synthase activity in the leaves. Temperature dependence of isoprene emission is obtained by combining the temperature response curves of photosynthetic electron transport, the shape of which is related to long-term temperature during leaf growth and development, and the specific activity of isoprene synthase, which is considered as essentially constant for all plants. The results of simulations demonstrate that the variety of temperature responses of isoprene emission observed within and among the species in previous studies may be explained by different optimum temperatures of J and/or limited maximum fraction of electrons used for isoprene synthesis.

In the US, livestock agriculture produces over one billion tons of manure annually on a renewable basis. Most of this manure is disposed of in lagoons or stored outdoors to decompose. Such disposal methods emit methane and nitrous oxide, two important GHGs with 21 and 310 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, respectively. In total, GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in the US amounted to 536 million metric tons (MMT) of carbon dioxide equivalent, or 7% of the total US emissions in 2005. Of this agricultural contribution, 51 to 118 MMT of carbon dioxide equivalent resulted from livestock manure emissions alone, with trends showing this contribution increasing from 1990 to 2005. Thus, limiting GHG emissions from manure represents a valuable starting point for mitigating agricultural contributions to global climate change. Anaerobic digestion, a process that converts manure to methane-rich biogas, can lower GHG emissions from manure significantly. Using biogas as a substitute for other fossil fuels, such as coal for electricity generation, replaces two GHG sources\u2014manure and coal combustion\u2014with a less carbon-intensive source, namely biogas combustion. The biogas energy potential was calculated using values for the amount of biogas energy that can be produced per animal unit (defined as 1000 pounds of animal) per day and the number of animal units in the US. The 95 million animal units in the country could produce nearly 1 quad of renewable energy per year, amounting to approximately 1% of the US total energy consumption. Converting the biogas into electricity using standard microturbines could produce 88 \u00b1 20 billion kWh, or 2.4 \u00b1 0.6% of annual electricity consumption in the US. Replacing coal and manure GHG emissions with the emissions from biogas would produce a net potential GHG emissions reduction of 99 \u00b1 59 million metric tons or 3.9 \u00b1 2.3% of the annual GHG emissions from electricity generation in the US.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "4fcc41b91c1d6604d21385e85d623fae718a2c86", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3030589897", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.chemrev.9b00659", "CorpusId": 218975179, "PubMed": "32459470"}, "title": "Recent Advances and Challenges of Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction to Ammonia.", "abstract": "Global ammonia production reached 175 million metric tons in 2016, 90% of which is produced from high purity N2 and H2 gases at high temperatures and pressures via the Haber-Bosch process.

As a part of the IPY project POLARCAT (Polar Study using Aircraft, Remote Sensing, Surface Measurements and Models, of Climate Chemistry, Aerosols and Transport), this paper studies the sources of equivalent black carbon (EBC), sulphate, light-scattering aerosols and ozone measured at the Arctic stations Zeppelin, Alert, Barrow and Summit during the years 2000\u20132007. These species are important pollutants and climate forcing agents, and sulphate and EBC are main components of Arctic haze. To determine where these substances originate, the measurement data were combined with calculations using FLEXPART, a Lagrangian particle dispersion model. The climatology of atmospheric transport from surrounding regions on a twenty-day time scale modelled by FLEXPART shows that the stations Zeppelin, Alert and Barrow are highly sensitive to surface emissions in the Arctic and to emissions in high-latitude Eurasia in winter. Emission sensitivities over southern Asia and southern North America are small throughout the year. The high-altitude station Summit is an order of magnitude less sensitive to surface emissions in the Arctic whereas emissions in the southern parts of the Northern Hemisphere continents are more influential relative to the other stations. Our results show that for EBC and sulphate measured at Zeppelin, Alert and Barrow, northern Eurasia is the dominant source region. For sulphate, Eastern Europe and the metal smelting industry in Norilsk are particularly important. For EBC, boreal forest fires also contribute in summer. No evidence for any substantial contribution to EBC from sources in southern Asia is found. European air masses are associated with low ozone concentrations in winter due to titration by nitric oxides, but are associated with high ozone concentrations in summer due to photochemical ozone formation. There is also a strong influence of ozone depletion events in the Arctic boundary layer on measured ozone concentrations in spring and summer. These results will be useful for developing emission reduction strategies for the Arctic.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "648ac048478075bc694122ab7a75c2442fe0ccec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2944202717", "DOI": "10.1007/s11430-019-9343-3", "CorpusId": 165119126}, "title": "The impact of meteorological changes from 2013 to 2017 on PM2.5 mass reduction in key regions in China", "abstract": "In 2013, China issued the \u201cAction Plan for the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution\u201d (\u201cTen Statements of Atmosphere\u201d) and implemented a series of pollution reduction measures from 2013 to 2017. In key regions of China, the mass concentrations of particulate matter with aerodynamic equivalent diameters less than 2.5 \u00b5m (PM2.5) have dropped significantly. However, the contributions of meteorological changes to PM2.5 reduction are largely uncertain, which has attracted particular concern from the government and the public. Here, we investigated the impact of large-scale and boundary layer (BL) meteorological conditions on aerosol pollution and estimated the contributions of meteorological changes to PM2.5 reduction based on in-depth analysis and diagnosis of various observed meteorological elements and an integrated pollution-linked meteorological index (PLAM, which is approximately and linearly related to PM mass concentration). In this study, we found that the meteorological conditions worsened in 2014 and 2015 and improved in 2016 and 2017 relative to those in 2013 in key regions in China. In 2017 relative to 2013, only \u223c5% (approximately 13% of the total PM2.5 decline) of the 39.6% reduction in PM2.5 mass concentrations can be attributed to meteorological changes in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, and only \u223c7% (approximately 20% of the total PM2.5 decline) of the 34.3% reduction can be attributable to meteorological changes in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. Overall, the PM2.5 reduction due to meteorological improvement is much lower than the observed PM2.5 reduction in these areas, which indicates that emission reduction during the five-year implementation of the \u201cTen Statements of Atmosphere\u201d is the dominant factor in the improvement in air quality. The changes in meteorology and climate are conducive to PM2.5 reduction but do not dominate the substantial improvement in air quality. Similar to the above regions, in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, the impact of meteorological changes on the annual averaged PM2.5 concentration from 2013 to 2017 was relatively weak, and the PM2.5 reduction was mainly due to emission reductions. During winter 2017 (January, February, and December of this year), the meteorological conditions improved \u223c20% in the BTH region (observed total PM2.5 reduction: 40.2%) and \u223c30% in the YRD region (observed total PM2.5 reduction: 38.2%) relative to those in 2013, showing the meteorological factors played more important role in the decrease of PM2.5 in winter of these years in the two regions, respectively. The meteorological conditions in winter 2016 were 14% better than those in winter 2017, but the PM2.5 reduction in winter 2016 was still less than that in winter 2017, reinforcing the significant contributions of the increasing efforts to reduce PM2.5 emissions in 2017. The substantial progress of strict emission measures was also confirmed by a comparison of several persistent heavy aerosol pollution episodes (HPEs) with similar meteorological conditions. It is found that the decrease of PM2.5 mass caused by emission reduction increases year by year, especially the decrease of PM2.5 concentration in 2016 and 2017. In China, HPEs mainly occur in winter, when meteorological conditions are approximately 40\u2013100% worse than in other seasons. This worsening is partly due to the harbor effect of high topography, including downdrafts and the weak wind zone, and partly due to the increasingly stable regional BL structure caused by climate warming. For the formation of HPEs, it occurred under regional stagnant and stable conditions associated with upper-level circulation patterns, including the zonal westerly winds type and high-pressure ridges. After pollution formation, PM2.5 with mass accumulated to a certain degree can further worsen the BL meteorological conditions. The feedback effect associated with worsening conditions dominates PM2.5 mass explosive growth. In the context of high air pollutant emissions in China, unfavorable meteorological conditions are the necessary external conditions for the formation and accumulation of HPEs. Therefore, reducing aerosol pollution significantly during the earlier transport stage is critical in reducing persistent HPEs. Currently, even under favorable meteorological conditions, allowing emissions without restriction is also not advisable because aerosol pollution allowed to accumulate to a certain extent will significantly worsen the BL meteorological conditions and close the \u201cmeteorological channels\u201d available for pollution dispersion.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "7ef6e7873027928d8257bf8242b80da1949ee043", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "6792386", "MAG": "2952284260", "DOI": "10.1289/EHP4157", "CorpusId": 195328528, "PubMed": "31232608"}, "title": "Estimated Contributions of Emissions Controls, Meteorological Factors, Population Growth, and Changes in Baseline Mortality to Reductions in Ambient PM2.5 and PM2.5-Related Mortality in China, 2013\u20132017", "abstract": "Background: In 2013, China released the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan (Action Plan), which set the roadmap for national air pollution control actions for the period of 2013 to 2017.

Objective: We aimed to quantify the relative contributions four factors: emission reductions, changed meteorology, population growth, and a change in baseline mortality rates to the reduced PM2.5-related mortality (PM2.5-mortality) during the 2013\u20132017 period and evaluate the importance of emission controls for human health protection in China. Methods: The integrated exposure\u2013response function was adopted to estimate the chronic health effects of PM2.5. The annual PM2.5 concentrations were estimated from chemical transport model simulations combined with surface observations for 2013 and 2017. Relative contributions to PM2.5-mortality from emission reductions and the three factors were individually quantified through scenario analysis. Results: The estimated total PM2.5-mortality in China was 1.389 million [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.005 million, 1.631 million] in 2013 but was substantially reduced to 1.102 million (95% CI: 0.755 million, 1.337 million) in 2017. Emission controls contributed 88.7% to this reduction in PM2.5-mortality, while changed meteorology, the change in baseline mortality rates, and population growth during 2013\u20132017 contributed 9.6, 3.8, and \u22122.2%, respectively. Conclusions: The implementation of the Action Plan has significantly reduced the PM2.5 concentration in regions of China where population density is high, dominating the decline in PM2.5-mortality during 2013\u20132017. However, the health burden of PM2.5 pollution in China is still extremely high compared with that in other developed countries.

The relative prices then determine the trade-off between gases at each point in time, taking into account economical as well as physical considerations.

Comprehensive field measurements are needed to understand the mercury emissions from Chinese power plants and to improve the accuracy of emission inventories.

The pulverized coal, bottom ash, fly ash and gypsum were also sampled in the field. Mercury concentrations in coal burned in the measured power plants ranged from 17 to 385 \u03bcg/kg. The mercury mass balances for the six power plants varied from 87 to 116% of the input coal mercury for the whole system.

Rice paddies are the largest anthropogenic methane source and produce 7\u201317% of atmospheric methane. Warm waterlogged soil and exuded nutrients from rice roots provide ideal conditions for methanogenesis in paddies with annual methane emissions of 25\u2013100-million tonnes. This scenario will be exacerbated by an expansion in rice cultivation needed to meet the escalating demand for food in the coming decades. There is an urgent need to establish sustainable technologies for increasing rice production while reducing methane fluxes from rice paddies. However, ongoing efforts for methane mitigation in rice paddies are mainly based on farming practices and measures that are difficult to implement. Despite proposed strategies to increase rice productivity and reduce methane emissions, no high-starch low-methane-emission rice has been developed. Here we show that the addition of a single transcription factor gene, barley SUSIBA2 (refs 7, 8), conferred a shift of carbon flux to SUSIBA2 rice, favouring the allocation of photosynthates to aboveground biomass over allocation to roots. The altered allocation resulted in an increased biomass and starch content in the seeds and stems, and suppressed methanogenesis, possibly through a reduction in root exudates. Three-year field trials in China demonstrated that the cultivation of SUSIBA2 rice was associated with a significant reduction in methane emissions and a decrease in rhizospheric methanogen levels. SUSIBA2 rice offers a sustainable means of providing increased starch content for food production while reducing greenhouse gas emissions from rice cultivation.

Herein, we created a liquid metal electrocatalyst that contains metallic elemental cerium nanoparticles, which facilitates the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to layered solid carbonaceous species, at a low onset potential of \u2212310\u2009mV vs CO2/C. We exploited the formation of a cerium oxide catalyst at the liquid metal/electrolyte interface, which together with cerium nanoparticles, promoted the room temperature reduction of CO2. Due to the inhibition of van der Waals adhesion at the liquid interface, the electrode was remarkably resistant to deactivation via coking caused by solid carbonaceous species. The as-produced solid carbonaceous materials could be utilised for the fabrication of high-performance capacitor electrodes. Overall, this liquid metal enabled electrocatalytic process at room temperature may result in a viable negative emission technology.While CO2 reduction proves an appealing means to convert greenhouse emissions to high-value products, there are few materials capable of such a conversion. Here, the\u00a0authors demonstrate a liquid-metal electrocatalyst to convert CO2 directly into solid carbon that can be used as capacitor electrodes.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "171235aab1dfe1953e9e455922f704c6815bfcd2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2135080304", "DOI": "10.1139/X06-257", "CorpusId": 85789337}, "title": "Integrated carbon analysis of forest management practices and wood substitution", "abstract": "The complex fluxes between standing and harvested carbon stocks, and the linkage between harvested biomass and fossil fuel substitution, call for a holistic, system-wide analysis in a life-cycle perspective to evaluate the impacts of forest management and forest product use on carbon balances. We have analysed the net carbon emission under alternative forest management strategies and product uses, considering the carbon fluxes and stocks associated with tree biomass, soils, and forest products. Simulations were made using three Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forest management regimes (traditional, intensive management, and intensive fertilization), three slash management practices (no removal, removal, and removal with stumps), two forest product uses (construction material and biofuel), and two reference fossil fuels (coal and natural gas). The greatest reduction of net carbon emission occurred when the forest was fertilized, slash and stumps were harvested, wood was used as construction materia...", "year": 2007}]}
