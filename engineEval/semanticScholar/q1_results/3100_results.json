N., Hanigan, M., Cole, A., Todd, R., McAllister T. A., Ndegwa, P. and Rotz, A. 2011. Review: Ammonia emissions from dairy farms and beef feedlots. Can. J. Anim. Sci. 91: 1-35. Ammonia emitted from animal feeding operations is an environmental and human health hazard, contributing to eutrophication of surface waters and nitrate contamination of ground waters, soil acidity, and fine particulate matter formation. It may also contribute to global warming through nitrous oxide formation. Along with these societal concerns, ammonia emission is a net loss of manure fertilizer value to the producer. A significant portion of cattle manure nitrogen, primarily from urinary urea, is converted to ammonium and eventually lost to the atmosphere as ammonia. Determining ammonia emissions from cattle operations is complicated by the multifaceted nature of the factors regulating ammonia volatilization, such as manure management, ambient temperature, wind speed, and manure composition and pH. Approaches to quantify ammonia emissions include micrometeorological methods, mass balance accounting and enclosures. Each method has its advantages, disadvantages and appropriate application. It is also of interest to determine the ammonia emitting potential of manure (AEP) independent of environmental factors. The ratio of nitrogen to non-volatile minerals (phosphorus, potassium, ash) or nitrogen isotopes ratio in manure has been suggested as a useful indicator of AEP. Existing data on ammonia emission factors and flux rates are extremely variable. For dairy farms, emission factors from 0.82 to 250 g ammonia per cow per day have been reported, with an average of 59 g per cow per day (n=31). Ammonia flux rates for dairy farms averaged 1.03 g m-2 h-1 (n=24). Ammonia losses are significantly greater from beef feedlots, where emission factors average 119 g per animal per day (n=9) with values as high as 280 g per animal per day. Ammonia flux rate for beef feedlots averaged 0.174 g m-2 h-1 (n=12). Using nitrogen mass balance approaches, daily ammonia nitrogen losses of 25 to 50% of the nitrogen excreted in manure have been estimated for dairy cows and feedlot cattle. Practices to mitigate ammonia emissions include reducing excreted N (particularly urinary N), acidifying ammonia sources, or binding ammonium to a substrate. Reducing crude protein concentration in cattle diets and ruminal protein degradability are powerful tools for reducing N excretion, AEP, and whole-farm ammonia emissions. Reducing dietary protein can also benefit the producer by reducing feed cost. These interventions, however, have to be balanced with the risk of lost production. Manure treatment techniques that reduce volatile N species (e.g., urease inhibition, pH reduction, nitrification-denitrification) are also effective for mitigating ammonia emissions. Another option for reducing ammonia emissions is capture and treatment of released ammonia. Examples in the latter category include biofilters, permeable and impermeable covers, and manure incorporation into the soil for crop or pasture production. Process-level simulation of ammonia formation and emission provides a useful tool for estimating emissions over a wide range of production practices and evaluating the potential benefits of mitigation strategies. Reducing ammonia emissions from dairy and beef cattle operations is critical to achieving environmentally sustainable animal production that will benefit producers and society at large.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "645602ebb0822c0f4a554f28a4b8078e49c9fe8d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1967670394", "DOI": "10.1109/TPWRS.2015.2398821", "CorpusId": 9156671}, "title": "A Novel Policy for LMP Calculation in Distribution Networks Based on Loss and Emission Reduction Allocation Using Nucleolus Theory", "abstract": "This paper proposes a new policy to calculate the locational marginal price (LMP) in the distribution networks containing distributed generation (DG). The proposed policy is based on remunerating the DG units to reduce the loss and emission of the network. LMP at each DG bus is calculated according to the contribution of the DG to the reduced amount of loss and emission. An iterative algorithm which is based on the nucleolus theory is proposed to allocate the loss and emission reduction. The proposed algorithm will provide a robust state estimation tool for distribution companies (DISCOs) in the next step of operation. The state estimation tool provides the decision maker with the ability to exert its control over private DG units when the loss and emission are minimized. Also, the proposed pricing policy requires decision maker to simply apply its best response strategy to the LMP based on the priority of loss, emission and DISCO's extra benefit. The proposed methodology is applied to two realistic distribution networks, and efficiency and accuracy of the method are verified.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "5016417e3932242fccd69d08b6a0c50251b6ce2e", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1093/reep/ren005", "CorpusId": 225068532}, "title": "Instrument Choice in Environmental Policy", "abstract": "The choice of pollution control instrument is a crucial environmental policy decision. We examine the extent to which various environmental policy instruments meet major evaluation criteria, including cost-effectiveness, distributional equity, the ability to address uncertainties, and political feasibility. Instruments considered include emissions taxes, tradable emissions allowances, subsidies for emissions reductions, performance standards, mandates for the adoption of specific technologies, and subsidies for research toward new, \u201cclean\u201d technologies. We consider policies that address pollution externalities and policies that deal with market failures associated with efforts to invent or deploy new technologies. Several themes emerge. First, no single instrument is clearly superior along all the dimensions relevant to policy choice; even the ranking along a single dimension often depends on the circumstances involved. Second, significant trade-offs arise in the choice of instrument: for example, assuring a reasonable degree of distributional equity will often require a sacrifice of cost-effectiveness. Third, it is sometimes desirable to design hybrid instruments that combine features of various \u201cpure\u201d instruments. Fourth, for many pollution problems, more than one market failure may be involved, which may justify (on efficiency grounds, at least) employing more than one instrument.

Aircraft are attributed with emitting approximately 2% of all anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2), and the total radiative forcing caused by aircraft emissions is a factor of two to four times greater than radiative forcing due to aircraft CO2 emissions alone [IPCC 1999]. Non-CO2 radiative forcing results primarily from emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and the formation of contrails and cirrus clouds. The magnitudes of climate impacts due to both of these phenomena depend strongly on cruise altitude. Additionally, aircraft fuel burn and NOx emissions rate depend on ight altitude. This study combines altitude variation of fuel consumption, emissions rate, and emissions eects to examine the relative climate impacts of dierent aircraft designs, as measured by the global mean temperature change resulting from 100 years of sustained aircraft operation. A simple time- and altitudevarying climate model is presented and integrated with an aircraft conceptual design code. Optimization studies are performed to compare economic and environmental performance of aircraft congurations. First, we optimize for a minimum-cost conguration, which is used as a reference for comparing performance of a variety of green designs. By optimizing an aircraft for minimum fuel burn or minimum NOx emissions, savings of up to 16% in fuel burn and 50% in NOx emissions are possible compared with a minimum-cost design. However, these aircraft achieve small reductions in global warming impacts of at most 7%. More signicant reductions in global warming impacts can be attained by designing aircraft to y at lower altitudes. A 30% reduction in global warming impacts can be reached by designing aircraft to cruise at about 28,000 ft and Mach 0.75, which increases operating costs by 1 to 2% relative to a minimum cost aircraft. A 50% reduction in global warming impacts can be achieved by aircraft designed to cruise at 25,000 ft and Mach 0.72, with a 1.5 to 3% increase in total operating costs. Up to a 75% reduction in global warming impacts can be attained by designing aircraft to cruise as low as 18,000 ft. Unfortunately, there is considerable uncertainty in estimating the global warming eects of NO x emissions and cloud formation. To address this, studies are performed to examine the sensitivity of results to variation in the magnitude of radiative forcing due to NOx emissions and cloud formation. Regardless of whether these forcings are much greater or less than current best estimates, there is still a potential net global warming impact savings of 20 to 55% possible by designing aircraft to cruise 10,000 ft lower and at a 12% lower Mach number than the minimum-cost conguration.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "ceb4798c85f467b993e3bb21d4530db91037870c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2005670990", "DOI": "10.1111/J.1574-6968.2001.TB10624.X", "CorpusId": 36059364, "PubMed": "11430414"}, "title": "Group-specific 16S rRNA targeted probes for the detection of type I and type II methanotrophs by fluorescence in situ hybridisation.", "abstract": "The study of methane-oxidising bacteria (methanotrophs) is of special interest, because of their role in the natural reduction of methane emissions from many different sources.

It is found that the CDM is not yet capturing a large portion of the identified abatement potential in most countries. Although the costs of most emissions reduction opportunities grasped are below the average credit price, there are still plenty of available low-cost opportunities. Mexico and Argentina appear to use the CDM predominantly for harvesting the low-hanging fruit, whereas in the other countries more expensive projects are accessing the CDM.

We use global climate model simulations to estimate the impacts of changing fire emissions on air quality, visibility, and premature deaths in the middle and late 21st century. We find that PM2.5 concentrations will decrease overall in the contiguous United States (CONUS) due to decreasing anthropogenic emissions (total PM2.5 decreases by 3% in Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5 and 34% in RCP4.5 by 2100), but increasing fire\u2010related PM2.5 (fire\u2010related PM2.5 increases by 55% in RCP4.5 and 190% in RCP8.5 by 2100) offsets these benefits and causes increases in total PM2.5 in some regions. We predict that the average visibility will improve across the CONUS, but fire\u2010related PM2.5 will reduce visibility on the worst days in western and southeastern U.S. regions.

The global diffusion of RE technologies (photovoltaic and wind) depends on the development of technology costs, which are modeled using learning curves. With increasing deployment of renewables within the EU as well as increasing RD&D efforts, the EU can achieve an accelerated costs decrease for these technologies, thus fostering deployment of RPGTs at a global scale through the effect of decreasing costs.

This paper explores how the wireless communication systems improve drivers\u2019 driving behaviors and its contributions to the emission reduction, in terms of Operating Mode (OpMode) IDs distribution used in emission estimation. A simulated work zone with completed traffic operation was selected as a test bed. Sixty subjects were recruited for the tests, whose demographic distribution was based on the Census data in Houston, Texas. A scene of a pedestrian\u2019s crossing in the work zone was designed for the driving test. Meanwhile, a wireless communication system called Drivers Smart Advisory System (DSAS) was proposed and introduced in the driving simulation, which provided drivers with warning messages in the work zone. Two scenarios were designed for a leading vehicle as well as for a following vehicle driving through the work zone, which included a base test without any wireless communication systems, and a driving test with the trigger of the DSAS. Subjects\u2019 driving behaviors in the simulation were recorded to evaluate safety and estimate the vehicle emission using the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released emission model MOVES. The correlation between drivers\u2019 driving behavior and the distribution of the OpMode ID during each scenario was investigated. Results show that the DSAS was able to induce drivers to accelerate smoothly, keep longer headway distance and stop earlier for a hazardous situation in the work zone, which driving behaviors result in statistically significant reduction in vehicle emissions for almost all studied air pollutants (p-values range from 4.10E-51 to 2.18E-03). The emission reduction was achieved by the switching the distribution of the OpMode IDs from higher emission zones to lower emission zones. Implications: Transportation section is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions. Many studies demonstrate that the wireless communication system dedicated for safety and mobility issues may contribute to the induction in vehicle emissions through changing driving behaviors. An insight into the correlation between the driving behaviors and the distribution of Operating Mode (OpMode) IDs is essential to enhance the emission reduction.

We hypothesized that current land use patterns are shaped by insecurity in formal forest tenure alongside informal land tenure arrangements with migrants.

The spectrum of the light emission had a broad maximum between 400 and 450 nm being attributed to F-centre luminescence of aluminium oxide. The mechanism of the luminescence is associated with the two-step reduction of peroxydisulfate anions near the oxide-covered cathode where the first one-electronic reduction step occurs either (i) by tunnel-emission generated hydrated electrons or (ii) by trickling down the surface states to the energy level of peroxydisulfate ion or (iii) by direct heterogeneous electron transfer from the bottom of the aluminium oxide conduction band to peroxydisulfate ions during strong downward band bending induced by cathodic pulse-polarisation. The second step occurs by electrons from F- or F \n + \n-centres at the oxide/electrolyte interface. Transitions of aluminium oxide conduction band electrons to fill the sulfate radical-emptied electron trapping sites (oxygen vacancies) produces analogous F- and F \n + \n-centre luminescence to that occurring during photoluminescence and thermoluminescence of aluminium oxide. No enhancement of light emission was observed in the presence of hydrogen peroxide which is also reduced in a two-step process at oxide-covered aluminium electrode. This can be explained by the fact that the energy level of hydroxyl radical under the present conditions lies ca. 1 eV above, whereas the energy level of sulfate radical lies somewhat below the colour-centre sub-band of aluminium oxide.

The climate scenarios were used to drive the GIS-coupled biogeochemical model Photosynthesis-Evapotranspiration-Model\u2013Denitrification-Decomposition-Model (PnET-N-DNDC), which has currently been tested for its predicting capability for soil N trace gas emissions for various sites across Europe. The model results show a complex, spatially differentiated pattern of changes in future N2O and NO emissions from the forest soils across Europe, which were driven by the combined effect of changes in precipitation and temperature. Overall, the model predicted that N2O emissions from the European forest soils will on average decrease by 6%. This decrease was mainly due to the shift in N2O:N2 ratio driven by enhanced denitrification. NO emissions were found to increase by 9%.

Historical data and mechanistic scenarios are used to examine potential impacts above and below six of the largest dams planned for the region, including reductions in downstream sediment and nutrient supplies, changes in downstream flood pulse, changes in upstream and downstream fish yields, reservoir siltation, greenhouse gas emissions and mercury contamination. Together, these six dams are predicted to reduce the supply of sediments, phosphorus and nitrogen from the Andean region by 69, 67 and 57% and to the entire Amazon basin by 64, 51 and 23%, respectively. These large reductions in sediment and nutrient supplies will have major impacts on channel geomorphology, floodplain fertility and aquatic productivity. These effects will be greatest near the dams and extend to the lowland floodplains. Attenuation of the downstream flood pulse is expected to alter the survival, phenology and growth of floodplain vegetation and reduce fish yields below the dams. Reservoir filling times due to siltation are predicted to vary from 106\u20136240 years, affecting the storage performance of some dams. Total CO2 equivalent carbon emission from 4 Andean dams was expected to average 10 Tg y-1 during the first 30 years of operation, resulting in a MegaWatt weighted Carbon Emission Factor of 0.139 tons C MWhr-1.

Rapid motorization \u2014 more cars and trucks \u2014 is the principal cause. This report focuses on the challenges faced by developing countries in accommodating and managing motorization and the demand for improved transportation. Enhanced mobility has many positive effects on economic development and social welfare, including more efficient movement of goods and improved access to jobs, health services, and education. However, if enhanced mobility is achieved primarily through increased reliance on conventional private cars, it can mean diverting substantial financial resources to roads and suffering worse air pollution and traffic congestion. The benefits are enormous, but the costs can also be substantial. These positives and negatives are accentuated in the developing nations of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Most are experiencing rapid population growth and urbanization, and many have fast-growing economies. The number of private vehicles is increasing in almost all developing countries. The challenges posed by motorization are unprecedented for these countries. When the more developed countries were building their transportation infrastructure, their populations were small compared to those in much of today\u2019s developing world, and the cost of motorized vehicles was relatively high. Today\u2019s megacities of the developing world are already huge and still expanding. There is little time or money to build public transportation systems or to expand roads to handle the new traffic. They are already experiencing serious congestion, economic and environmental damage, and major safety problems. Yet the problems are not uniform; each city and country faces different circumstances. This report provides a broad characterization of transportation in developing countries, identifying common challenges and opportunities for policymakers, and suggesting policy options that aim to slow the growth of greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector. The most important observations of this report are the following: \u2022 Rapid motorization \u2014 and rapid growth in transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 are unavoidable in most developing nations. Most developing countries today have low per capita transportation emissions, largely because few people have access to personal transportation. Rapid motorization is transforming transportation and accelerating increases in greenhouse gas emissions. \u2022 The relationship between car ownership and income is not fixed. While it is true that income is the primary force of motorization \u2014 explaining perhaps half the growth in vehicle ownership \u2014 there is much variation in vehicle ownership among cities and countries at similar income levels. \u2022 Once people have personal vehicles, they use them even if alternative transportation modes are available. This is because the variable cost of operating a vehicle is relatively low compared to the fixed cost of purchasing one. \u2022 There are many sensible policies and strategies that would slow the growth of transportation sector greenhouse gas emissions. Key strategies include increasing the relative cost of using conventional private cars and enhancing the quality and choices of alternative transportation modes. \u2022 Many of the strategies for slowing and eventually reducing greenhouse gas emissions from transportation have local as well as global benefits. Local benefits include reduced air pollution, less traffic congestion, and lower expenditures for road infrastructure. This report explores strategic paths and alternative futures that could break the link between economic and greenhouse gas emission growth in developing countries. Successful efforts underway in some developing countries \u2014 examples of which are highlighted in some of the case study reports that contributed to this overview \u2014 demonstrate that developing countries can forge a more sustainable transportation future. Is there a single city that can be looked to as a model for others? This report suggests that the answer is \u201cno.\u201d There are cities and countries that have embraced innovative and effective strategies, but none represents a universally applicable model or pathway. Energy use and carbon emissions around the globe are increasing faster in transportation than in any other sector, and transportation emissions are increasing fastest of all in developing countries. This report does not suggest that developing nations should adopt entirely different transportation systems than currently operate in more developed countries. There is no perfect solution or leapfrog technology at hand. The reality is that most transportation modes and technologies are already being used internationally. The fundamental desire for personal transportation, and for greater mobility at lower cost, is universal. It is neither realistic nor fair to ask those in the developing world to deprive themselves of the things they need and want, from meeting their basic transportation needs to having access to cars. Instead, this report suggests that developing countries can choose a more sustainable growth path. They can learn from the experiences of industrialized countries in crafting integrated land use and transportation plans, encouraging more efficient forms of vehicle ownership and use, and accelerating the introduction of environmentally sensible vehicle technologies and fuels. Indeed, as a 1996 U.S. National Academy of Sciences report concluded, \u201cgreater reliance on nonpolluting modes of transportation in developing-country cities, coupled with the strong integration of residential and economic activities, suggests those cities may be in a position to avoid some of the most costly mistakes of transportation investment in the industrialized countries.\u201d1 However, the economies and populations of many of these cities are growing at unprecedented rates and personal vehicles are often available to people with very low incomes. Policy and investment decisions with far-reaching implications must be made quickly, or the consequences could be catastrophic \u2014 economically, environmentally, and socially. But even with the greatest sophistication and best managers, the choices are not obvious. Simply replicating the choices of other cities in most cases would be ineffective. The elements of a successful transportation strategy are likely to vary greatly depending on local circumstances and institutional strengths and weaknesses. Without new measures, greenhouse gas emissions from transportation in the developing world will exceed those in the industrialized world sometime after 2010. While the need to limit greenhouse gas emissions may not be a driving force for developing countries in the foreseeable future, many of the strategies that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions would also address the more immediate problems of local air pollution, access to basic transportation, and infrastructure financing pressures. This report focuses on strategies and policies that not only slow the growth of greenhouse gas emissions, but also help achieve local priorities.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "de39f0c266cc3e2f6eeab013b43346b744562624", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1550694862", "CorpusId": 93147436}, "title": "Effects of photochemical oxidants on plants", "abstract": "Photochemical oxidants are found in 'photochemical smog' which is a complex mixture of primary and secondary air pollutants.

The uncertainties in these scenarios mainly relate to the future behavior of nitrogen in the ecosystem and the effects of climate change. Four major climate-related confounding factors that may influence the chemical and biological recovery process are: i) increased frequency and severity of sea-salt episodes; ii) increased frequency and severity of drought; iii) in-creased turnover of organic carbon; iv) increased mineralization of nitrogen. International cooperative work to abate acidification has so far been very successful, but there is still a long way to go, and many potential setbacks.

We continue with a review for the year 2020, which will be remembered by COVID and the significant negative impact it had on the industry. However, it also provided a glimpse of the possible improvement in air quality with reduced anthropogenic emissions. It was a year marked by goals set for climate change mitigation via reduced fossil fuel use by the transportation sector. Governments stepped up plans to accelerate the adoption of zero tailpipe emitting vehicles. However, any transformation of the transportation sector is not going to happen overnight due to the scale of the infrastructure and technology challenges. A case in point is China, which announced a technology roadmap which envisions half of the vehicles to be hybrids in 2035. The ICE is clearly expected to be part of the powertrain mix for a long time and as such, solutions are needed to attain near-zero emissions, even with conventional engines. The industry is naturally responding to all of these changes and several technology solutions are being advanced, including improved efficiency, advanced aftertreatment systems, hybridization, low carbon fuels and predictive control strategies. It was also a year of heightened regulatory activity on what could perhaps be the last major regulations on criteria pollutants in advanced markets. California adopted the Low NOx Omnibus rule requiring a 90% reduction in NOx from heavy-duty vehicles. Elements of light-duty LEV IV regulations were discussed, which could culminate in a fleet averaged NMOG + NOx limit of 20 mg/mi. Proposals were made for Euro 7/VII, and several major changes put forth for consideration, including tightening of limits, inclusion of sub-23 nm particles, an emphasis on urban driving and an overall shift in certification based on real-world driving emission measurements with limited allowed exclusions. Limits may be imposed on previously non-regulated species such as NH3 which will drive additional content. Technologies are advancing, both on engines and aftertreatment systems. Light-duty gasoline engines are approaching 45% BTE. Heavy duty diesel engines are approaching 55% BTE. We cover some of the major technologies being pursued to extend these gains. Gasoline particulate filters are now rapidly becoming a mature technology for light-duty vehicles in Europe and China, although the next round of regulations will require a significant increase in filtration efficiency. Concept studies show pathways to reduce gas emissions well below the next proposed limits. A major thrust on the heavy-duty side is to analyze systems capable of meeting the low NOx requirements while also extending durability. We cover the various leading approaches and latest advances in de-NOx technologies. We also briefly touch upon fuels, which will play a critical role, whether in improving efficiency of advanced combustion such as gasoline compression ignition or in their role with reducing greenhouse gas emissions through renewable or synthetic fuels. Finally, as we approach near-zero tailpipe emission levels, non-tailpipe emissions could become a significant fraction of the overall particulate inventory. \u00a9 2021 SAE International.

Widespread disappointment over the failure to achieve a binding global forest convention at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit has been followed by frustration over the relatively limited impact to date of post-Rio forest-related global policy initiatives, including intergovernmental and non-state efforts. This paper argues that \u201creduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation\u201d (REDD) initiatives will yield significant impacts only if decision makers are committed to a results-based \u201cdual effectiveness\u201d test, addressing both forest degradation and global emissions reductions, and involving significant and measurable global-scale targets. While the importance of such a commitment may appear obvious, lessons from past forest and climate efforts suggest that greater results-based accountability is needed to overcome short-term and narrowly defined organizational and national self-interest.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "fac0cd612713aac73b839f0b2b248b31d42b003e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2586243767", "CorpusId": 133070438}, "title": "Warm Mix Asphalt for Cold Weather Paving", "abstract": "Warm Mix Asphalt for Cold Weather Paving Olof Kristjansdottir Chair of the Supervisory Committee: Assistant Professor Stephen T. Muench Civil and Environmental Engineering Increased environmental awareness and stricter emissions regulations have led to a development of warm mix asphalt (WMA) to reduce the high mixing temperatures of regular hot mix asphalt (HMA). Its benefits are reduction in energy consumption during production and reduced emissions during production and placement. The three most tested methods are; WAM Foam, Aspha-min zeolite and Sasobit wax. All three methods reduce the viscosity of the binder at a certain temperature range, allowing the aggregate to be fully coated at lower temperatures than in HMA production. Previous research has not focused much on how WMA functions in cold weather paving. This paper investigates WMA\u2019s potential in cold weather conditions and specifically how Iceland, with such conditions, can benefit from it. The conclusions in this paper are drawn from a literature review and a survey that was conducted among Iceland\u2019s paving industry professionals. Reduced emissions are especially beneficial in densely populated areas and in non-open air paving. The decreased viscosity allows effective compaction at lower temperatures where cool down rates are slower. WMA\u2019s disadvantages are mainly related to rutting and moisture susceptibility issues. Using WMA processes at HMA production temperatures: 1) Increases the temperature gap between production and cessation, allowing e.g. increased haul distances 2) Facilitates compaction, which is beneficial for; stiff mixes and RAP, paving during extreme weather conditions and reduction in compaction effort. Icelandic professionals are generally positive towards WMA, interested in testing it further for Icelandic conditions, and hopeful about its potential for helping with some key problems in Icelandic paving. The final conclusion is that WMA is a viable option for cold weather conditions and for the paving industry in Iceland, Sasobit is most suitable of the three methods, and usage incentives are twofold: 1) As a compaction aid for mixes produced at, or close to, regular HMA production temperatures, used to increase haul distances and/or pave during cold and difficult weather conditions, and sometimes slightly reduce fuel consumption as well. 2) As an environmentally friendly method when emissions approach limits, although not an issue today it may become one with stricter emissions regulations or increased production.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "f137f5079a926854e7f983ee5eec77bfd83e38c3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2046397398", "DOI": "10.1007/BF00282730", "CorpusId": 96774177}, "title": "The cost and effectiveness of retrofit programs for used cars", "abstract": "Estimates are made of the cost and effectiveness of available retrofit devices.

Using comprehensive plantlevel data for around 9,500 French manufacturing firms, this paper explores the economic and environmental response of plants to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) \u2013 the EU\u2019s flagship climate policy. Our results suggest that ETS-regulated manufacturing plants in France reduced emissions by an average of 15.7%. The most marked reduction in emissions is observed during Phase II (2008-2013). In terms of economic outcomes, we find a statistically significant reduction in employment (10.4% in Phase II). We aim to understand whether these reductions are real global reductions in emissions or whether they are merely the result of carbon leakage. Leakage may occur because output shifts to unregulated plants, either within the EU or abroad. It may also occur because regulated plants outsource carbon intensive parts of the production process. We make some progress in providing evidence on this by looking at the fuel mix of plants. About half of the reduction in emissions can be accounted for by an increase in the share of gas, which is less carbon intensive than coal and oil. This is both consistent with carbon leakage, because of outsourcing, and real emissions reductions due to a technological change. Ongoing research will shed further light on this in the future. We also examine if there is leakage within firms by looking at firms with both, unregulated and regulated plants. However, we find no evidence in support of this. *Still preliminary.

At the same time, federal and state governments are promoting the use of alternative fuel vehicles as a means to curb local air pollution. As yet, the impact of this movement toward alternative fuels with respect to toxic emissions has not been well studied. The purpose of this paper is to compare toxic emissions from vehicles operating on a variety of fuels, including reformulated gasoline (RFG), natural gas, ethanol, methanol, liquid petroleum gas (LPG), and electricity. This study uses a version of Argonne National Laboratory's Greenhouse Gas, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation (GREET) model, appropriately modified to estimate toxic emissions. The GREET model conducts a total fuel-cycle analysis that calculates emissions from both downstream (e.g., operation of the vehicle) and upstream (e.g., fuel production and distribution) stages of the fuel cycle. We find that almost all of the fuels studied reduce 1,3-buta-diene emissions compared with conventional gasoline (CG). However, the use of ethanol in E85 (fuel made with 85% ethanol) or RFG leads to increased acetaldehyde emissions, and the use of methanol, ethanol, and compressed natural gas (CNG) may result in increased formaldehyde emissions.

The effectiveness of zeolite in controlling odor and VOCs was qualitatively evaluated in this controlled laboratory study involving simulated poultry manure storage. In the first two trials, zeolite was topically applied on nearly fresh laying hen manure at the rates of 0, 2.5, 5, and 10% (by weight).

The institutional forestry traditions dominated the emergence of the discourse on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) while more holistic perspectives on land-based emissions, including agriculture, found a home in international recognition for Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions (NAMAs). We tested the hypothesis that, at least for Indonesia, the NAMA framework provides opportunities to resolve issues that REDD+ alone cannot address. We reviewed progress on five major challenges identified in 2007 by the Indonesian Forest Climate Alliance: 1) scope and \u2018forest\u2019 definition; 2) ownership and tenurial rights; 3) multiplicity and interconnectedness of drivers; 4) peatland issues across forest and non-forest land categories; and 5) fairness and efficiency of benefit-distribution mechanisms across conservation, degradation and restoration phases of tree-cover transition. Results indicate that the two policy instruments developed in parallel with competition rather than synergy. Three of the REDD+ challenges can be resolved by treating REDD+ as a subset of the NAMA and national emission reduction plans for Indonesia. We conclude that two issues, rights and benefit distribution, remain a major challenge, and require progress on a motivational pyramid of policy and polycentric governance.

There is a need for more detailed information on processes of dust emission/transport and dust optical properties to inform model simulations of this source. During the Bodele Dust Experiment (BoDEx) in 2005 instrumentation was deployed to measure dust properties and boundary layer meteorology. Observations indicate that dust emission events are triggered when near surface wind speeds exceed 10ms-1, associated with synoptic scale variability in the large-scale atmospheric circulation. Dust emission pulses in phase with the diurnal cycle of near surface winds. Analysis of dust samples shows that the dust consists predominantly of fragments of diatomite sediment. The particle size distribution of this diatomite dust estimated from sun photometer data, using a modified Aeronet retrieval algorithm, indicate a dominant coarse mode (radius centred on 1-2?m) similar to other Saharan dust observations. Single scattering albedo values are high, broadly in line with other Saharan dust even though the diatomite composition of dust from the Bodele is likely to be unusual. The radiative impact of high dust loadings results in a reduction in surface daytime maximum temperature of around 7\u00b0C in the Bodele region. Using optical and physical properties of dust obtained in the field we estimate the total dust flux emitted from the Bodele to be 1.18\u00b10.45Tg per day during a substantial dust event.

The emission reduction has mainly been achieved engineering reduction, structural reduction, and administrative reduction. In this paper, three key industries (electricity generation, steel, and cement) are selected to measure the effects of SO2 emission reductions, the synergy effects of energy saving, and CO2 emission reduction. The main results show that, during the period of the \u201811th Five-Year Plan\u2019, engineering reduction of coal-fired power plant desulfurization played the most crucial role in the emission reduction; both engineering reduction and structural reduction can achieve low-pollution emission, but the contributions are not the same due to the divergence of relevant industries. Generally speaking, structural reduction can relatively easily achieve the synergy effect of the main pollutants and GHGs; in comparison, however, engineering reduction does not easily achieve the synergy effect. During the \u201813th Five-Year Plan\u2019 period, the following plans are proposed: strengthening the front pollution control, increasing the engineering reduction, narrowing the difference between the pollution reduction engineering ability and the actual pollution reduction effect, and strengthening the supervisory and administrative effect of both the approval of the front end and the running of the middle end.

China is one of the few countries in the world whose coal consumption constitutes about 70% of total primary energy, and over half of coals are burned directly for electricity generation. Atmospheric emissions of Hg and its speciation from coal-fired power plants are of great concern owing to their negative impacts on regional human health and ecosystem risks, as well as long-distance transport. In this paper, recent trends of atmospheric Hg emissions and its species split from coal-fired power plants in China during the period of 2000\u20132007 are evaluated, by integrating each plant's coal consumption and emission factors, which are classified by different subcategories of boilers, particulate matter (PM) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) control devices. Our results show that the total Hg emissions from coal-fired power plants have begun to decrease from the peak value of 139.19 t in 2005 to 134.55 t in 2007, though coal consumption growing steadily from 1213.8 to 1532.4 Mt, which can be mainly attributed to the co-benefit Hg reduction by electrostatic precipitators/fabric filters (ESPs/FFs) and wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD), especially the sharp growth in installation of WFGD both in the new and existing power plants since 2005. In the coming 12th five-year-plan, more and more plants will be mandated to install De-NOx (nitrogen oxides) systems (mainly selective catalytic reduction [SCR] and selective noncatalytic reduction [SNCR]) for minimizing NOx emission, thus the specific Hg emission rate per ton of coal will decline further owing to the much higher co-benefit removal efficiency by the combination of SCR + ESPs/FFs + WFGD systems. Consequently, SCR + ESPs/FFs + WFGD configuration will be the main path to abate Hg discharge from coal-fired power plants in China in the near future. However, advanced specific Hg removal technologies are necessary for further reduction of elemental Hg discharge in the long term. Implications Controlling of atmospheric Hg discharge from coal-fired power plants have aroused great concerns for its adverse impacts on regional environment and human health risks, as well as long-distance transportation. It is of great significance for Chinese decision makers to be aware of the current status of Hg emissions from coal-fired power plants, so that the regulations and policies regarding Hg abatement can be made that are cost-effective and feasible implementation.

GEPA is graphical in nature, and can be used to analyze the on-site and off-site GHG emissions of the WWTP. Furthermore, three GHG reduction strategies, i.e., increased aeration capacity, external carbon source controller, and reuse of biogas, are evaluated for their environmental load and operational cost reduction using the GEPA. A case study is used to elucidate the proposed method. In this study, the third strategy which reuses biogas from anaerobic digestion shows the largest reduction of GHG emissions.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "8292aa95130ec67d4449fa5404c13338efdcf532", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2075051255", "DOI": "10.1029/91JD02040", "CorpusId": 129361847}, "title": "Seasonal dependence of boundary layer peroxide concentration: The low and high NO x regimes", "abstract": "Concentrations of H2O2, organic peroxides, and other photochemically generated species were calculated using a zero-dimensional box model. The range of emission rates considered centered on values that are representative of conditions in a moderately polluted region such as the eastern United States. Solar intensity, temperature, humidity, and mixing layer height were varied to simulate changing conditions over a yearly cycle. Predicted concentrations of H2O2 have a pronounced seasonal dependence similar to that observed. Evidence is presented that the seasonal behavior of peroxide concentration is due to a transition between two qualitatively different photochemical states of the atmosphere. These states are called the low and high NOx regimes according to whether radical production is greater or less than the NOx emission rate. In the low NOx regime, more radicals are formed than can be accommodated by reaction with NOx, and the \u201cexcess\u201d radicals are removed by bimolecular radical-radical reactions leading in large part to peroxides. In this regime, peroxide formation is nearly proportional to the difference between radical source strength and the NOx emission rate and peroxide concentration scales with the factors affecting radical source strength (e.g., water vapor and photolysis rate constants). Radical production in the high NOx regime is insufficient to react with and remove all NOx. Consequences include the suppression of peroxide formation, a reduction in the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere, and high concentrations of primary pollutants.", "year": 1991}, {"paperId": "85079725bd5239d3c29bb375c7420bcef4bfb085", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2048445384", "DOI": "10.1007/s10705-004-7352-4", "CorpusId": 39344244}, "title": "Mitigation of N2O and CH4 Emission from Rice and Wheat Cropping Systems Using Dicyandiamide and Hydroquinone", "abstract": "Agriculture contributes considerably to the emission of greenhouse gases, such as N2O and CH4. Here we summarize results from previous pot experiments assessing the effectiveness of urease and nitrification inhibitors reducing both N2O and CH4 emissions from wheat and rice cropping systems fertilized with urea (U). For the wheat cropping system, using a cambisol, we observed that the application of U with hydroquinone (HQ, a urease inhibitor), U with dicyandiamide (DCD, a nitrification inhibitor) and U with HQ plus DCD decreased the N2O emissions by 11.4, 22.3 and 25.1%, respectively. For the rice copping system, using a luvisol, we found that the application of U with HQ, U with DCD and U with HQ plus DCD decreased N2O emissions by 10.6, 47.0 and 62.3%, respectively, and CH4 emissions by 30.1, 53.1 and 58.3%, respectively. In terms of total global warming potential (GWP) a reduction of 61.2% could be realized via the combined addition of HQ and DCD. The addition of wheat straw reduced the activity of HQ and DCD in the rice cropping experiments. In terms of total GWP only a reduction of 30.7% could be achieved. In general, both in upland and flooded conditions, the application of HQ and DCD alone was less effective than HQ in combination with DCD, but not significantly for U plus DCD treatment.

Time series of emission levels are compared for countries in Western and Eastern Europe, throwing light on differences in the importance of particular emission-driving forces. Three quarters of the decline in SO2 emissions in Western Europe resulted from a combination of reduced energy intensity and improved fuel mix, while dedicated end-of-pipe abatement measures played a dominant role in the reduction of NOx emissions. The increase in atmospheric emissions in Eastern Europe through the mid-1990s was associated with the growth of energy-intensive industries, which off-setted the positive impact of better fuel quality and changes in fuel mix.

However, our current understanding seems to be limited on the relationships between the urban form and the GHG emissions, namely how the urban form affects the lifestyles and thus the GHGs on a much wider scale than traditionally assumed. The urban form affects housing types, commuting distances, availability of different goods and services, social contacts and emulation, and the alternatives for pastimes, meaning that lifestyles are actually situated instead of personal projects. As almost all consumption, be it services or products, involves GHG emissions, looking at the emissions from transport and housing may not be sufficient to define whether one form would be more desirable than another. In the paper we analyze the urban form?lifestyle relationships in Finland together with the resulting GHG implications, employing both monetary expenditure and time use data to portray lifestyles in different basic urban forms: metropolitan, urban, semi-urban and rural. The GHG implications are assessed with a life cycle assessment (LCA) method that takes into account the GHG emissions embedded in different goods and services. The paper depicts that, while the direct emissions from transportation and housing energy slightly decrease with higher density, the reductions can be easily overridden by sources of indirect emissions. We also highlight that the indirect emissions actually seem to have strong structural determinants, often undermined in studies concerning sustainable urban forms. Further, we introduce a concept of ?parallel consumption? to explain how the lifestyles especially in more urbanized areas lead to multiplication of consumption outside of the limits of time budget and the living environment.

Predicted summer SOA was generally higher (10\u201315\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u22123) due to large contributions of isoprene (country average, 61\u202f%), although the relative importance varies in different regions.

The objective of this work was to investigate the \"total health effects\" of aerosol emissions, which include both exposure to particles and consequences for climate change initiated by particles.

Due to the scarcity of observational constraints and the rapidly changing environment in East and Southeast Asia, isoprene emissions predicted by models are expected to bear substantial uncertainties. The aim of this study is to improve upon the existing bottom-up estimates, and to investigate the temporal evolution of the fluxes in Asia over 1979\u20132012. To this purpose, we calculate the hourly emissions at 0.5\u00b0\u00d70.5\u00b0 resolution using the MEGAN\u2013MOHYCAN model driven by ECMWF ERA-Interim climatology. In order to remedy for known biases identified in previous studies, and to improve the simulation of interannual variability and trends in emissions, this study incorporates (i) changes in land use, including the rapid expansion of oil palms, (ii) meteorological variability according to ERA-Interim, (iii) long-term changes in solar radiation (dimming/brightening) constrained by surface network radiation measurements, and (iv) recent experimental evidence that South Asian tropical forests are much weaker isoprene emitters than previously assumed, and on the other hand, that oil palms have a strong isoprene emission capacity. These effects lead to a significant lowering (factor of 2) in the total isoprene fluxes over the studied domain, and to emission reductions reaching a factor of 3.5 in Southeast Asia. The bottom-up annual isoprene emissions for 2005 are estimated at 7.0, 4.8, 8.3, and 2.9 Tg in China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, respectively. The isoprene flux anomaly over the whole domain and studied period is found to be strongly correlated with the Oceanic Nino Index (r = 0.73), with positive (negative) anomalies related to El Nino (La Nina) years. Changes in temperature and solar radiation are the major drivers of the interannual variability and trends in the emissions, except over semi-arid areas such as northwestern China, Pakistan and Kazakhstan, where soil moisture is by far the main cause of interannual emission changes. In our base simulation, annual positive flux trends of 0.2% and 0.52% throughout the entire period are found in Asia and China, respectively, related to a positive trend in temperature and solar radiation. The impact of oil palm expansion in Indonesia and Malaysia is to enhance the trends over that region, e.g., from 1.17% to 1.5% in 1979\u20132005 in Malaysia. A negative emission trend is derived in India (\u22120.4%), owing to the negative trend in solar radiation data associated with the strong dimming effect likely due to increasing aerosol loadings. The bottom-up emissions are compared to field campaign measurements in Borneo and South China and further evaluated against top-down isoprene emission estimates constrained by GOME-2/MetOp-A formaldehyde columns through 2007\u20132012. The satellite-based estimates appear to support our assumptions, and confirm the lower emission rate in tropical forests of Indonesia and Malaysia. Additional flux measurements are clearly needed to characterize the spatial variability of emission factors better. Finally, a decreasing trend in the inferred top-down Chinese emissions since 2007 is in line with recorded cooling in China after that year, thus suggesting that the satellite HCHO columns are able to capture climate-induced changes in emissions.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "51d319f2423ee32ac1df5f4b8ba86f7565004119", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2109599943", "DOI": "10.1071/EA07280", "CorpusId": 86638286}, "title": "Fumaric acid supplements have no effect on methane emissions per unit of feed intake in wether lambs", "abstract": "Recent reports suggest that supplementing the diet of ruminants with up to 10% fumaric acid (FA) can produce large reductions in methane (CH4) emissions, but the results have been equivocal. This trial evaluates the potential of FA to reduce enteric CH4 emissions from 18-month-old wethers fed lucerne. On two occasions, methane emissions were measured on 20 wethers fed a diet of dried ground lucerne with FA added to the diet at 0, 4, 6, 8 and 10 g FA/100 g dry matter (n = 4 wethers/treatment). Individual daily CH4 emissions were estimated using the sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer gas technique together with measurements of daily dry matter intake (DMI) and total faecal output. Rumen samples were collected twice during the treatment periods in order to evaluate the effect of FA on rumen pH. There was a significant negative regression between FA% in the diet and CH4 emissions/day. However, the addition of FA did not affect CH4 emissions/kg DMI because high levels of FA supplementation reduced DMI. Rumen pH increased linearly with increasing level of FA supplementation. In conclusion, the effect of FA on CH4 emissions in this trial was associated with the resulting reduction in DMI and there were no decreases in CH4 emissions/kg DMI.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "a20eb5743ff8a6a30871c322b963f3e10e899317", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3024308523", "DOI": "10.1016/j.seps.2020.100867", "CorpusId": 219465654}, "title": "Can industrial agglomeration achieve the emission-reduction effect?", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "6b45bc031b22aedd41446cd7c5b1b970ab326578", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2096299776", "DOI": "10.3155/1047-3289.61.1.63", "CorpusId": 32923627, "PubMed": "21305889"}, "title": "Emission Reductions from Woody Biomass Waste for Energy as an Alternative to Open Burning", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Woody biomass waste is generated throughout California from forest management, hazardous fuel reduction, and agricultural operations. Open pile burning in the vicinity of generation is frequently the only economic disposal option. A framework is developed to quantify air emissions reductions for projects that alternatively utilize bio-mass waste as fuel for energy production. A demonstration project was conducted involving the grinding and 97-km one-way transport of 6096 bone-dry metric tons (BDT) of mixed conifer forest slash in the Sierra Nevada foothills for use as fuel in a biomass power cogeneration facility. Compared with the traditional open pile burning method of disposal for the forest harvest slash, utilization of the slash for fuel reduced particulate matter (PM) emissions by 98% (6 kg PM/BDT biomass), nitrogen oxides (NOx) by 54% (1.6 kg NOx/BDT), nonmethane volatile organics (NMOCs) by 99% (4.7 kg NMOCs/BDT), carbon monoxide (CO) by 97% (58 kg CO/BDT), and carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) by 17% (0.38 t CO2e/BDT).Emission contributions from biomass processing and transport operations are negligible. CO2e benefits are dependent on the emission characteristics of the displaced marginal electricity supply. Monetization of emissions reductions will assist with fuel sourcing activities and the conduct of biomass energy projects. IMPLICATIONS Economic considerations frequently dictate the disposal of woody biomass wastes by open burning. The alternative use for energy provides significant reduction in criteria air pollutant and greenhouse emissions. Valuing these reductions will improve the economic viability and increase the use of biomass for energy as well as assist with forest and agricultural management objectives.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "a8923e17aec52ad3c9df7bc4e0e64d3473e9cb06", "externalIds": {"MAG": "71307341", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-662-10502-3_1", "CorpusId": 107337771}, "title": "Future and Potential of Diesel Injection Systems", "abstract": "Heavy duty diesel engines are in conflict between the goals of emission reduction and optimization of fuel consumption.To fulfill future more stringent exhaust gas limits further developments on diesel engine technology are necessary. The diesel injection system assists this development and becomes the decisive factor to reach the emission targets. In the last 30 years a trend to high pressure fuel injection systems with an increase of maximum injection pressure from 800 up to 2000 bar is visible. In future very flexible high pressure fuel injection systems are necessary with multiple injection and rate shaping capabilities and a maximum injection pressure beyond 2000 bar. Very important is a high efficiency of the fuel injection system itself to reach low fuel consumption. New product engineering like new nozzle design (k-factor, vario nozzle,..) or new developed actuators are key factors for the fuel injection development. With a flexible diesel injection system in each point of the engine map the optimum rate shaping, injection timing and multiple injection is possible to get the best compromise between emission trade off and fuel consumption. For example with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) a rectangular type main injection with high injection pressures at full load is recommended. On the other hand without EGR in this point of the engine map a boot or ramp shape injection leads to the best emission results at constant or improved fuel consumption. With a coupled post injection the soot emission could be reduced. The late post injection is assisting the exhaust gas aftertreatment systems. The regeneration of the diesel particulate filter is for example because of too low exhaust gas temperature without the support of the injection system not under all circumstances possible. The exhaust gas temperature management by late post injection is a measure to improve the efficiency of catalyst systems at low exhaust gas temperatures. Very important in future is the capability of the electronic control unit (ECU) of the diesel injection system to control air management, exhaust gas emission management, tolerance reduction, diagnosis, vehicle functions and combustion process by the fuel injection system.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "66c9230034126c32dd03153d54b5d070deb6e113", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2108632608", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENPOL.2008.07.033", "CorpusId": 154370629}, "title": "On the contribution of labelled Certified Emission Reductions to sustainable development: A multi-criteria evaluation of CDM projects", "abstract": null, "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "7376e00ded8bdea104e6f4607ded29fe8c954d9c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2118580792", "DOI": "10.1093/TREEPHYS/20.12.799", "CorpusId": 24377068, "PubMed": "12651500"}, "title": "Temporal variability in basal isoprene emission factor.", "abstract": "Seasonal variability in basal isoprene emission factor (&mgr;g C g(-1) h(-1) or nmol m(-2) s(-1), leaf temperature at 30 degrees C and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) at 1000 &mgr;mol m(-2) s(-1)) was studied during the 1998 growing season at Duke Forest in the North Carolina Piedmont. Emissions from eight upper-canopy white oak (Quercus alba L.) leaves were measured periodically from the onset of isoprene emission on Day of Year (DOY) 119 (April 29) to leaf senescence in late October (DOY 299). Emissions from four leaves were measured under basal conditions with a controlled-environment cuvette system equipped with 10-ml gas-tight syringes and a reduction gas detector. Emissions from the other four leaves were measured under ambient conditions with the same system. Emission rates from the four leaves measured under ambient conditions were adjusted to basal conditions based on the PAR and leaf temperature algorithms of Guenther et al. (1993). The seasonal onset of isoprene emission was in agreement with previous studies where cumulative degree days from the date of the last spring frost were used to estimate bud break, leaf expansion, and increase in basal emission factor (EF). Between DOY 141 (May 21) and 240 (August 28), mean meteorological conditions 6 to 18 h prior to the EF measurements (ambient PAR and temperature) explained up to 78% of the variability in mean basal EF between measurement periods. Summertime mean isoprene emission potential was reached on DOY 141 (May 21) and was maintained until DOY 240 (August 28), when isoprene emission began to decline monotonically as leaf senescence approached. The mean value for leaves measured under ambient conditions and adjusted to basal conditions for DOY 141-240 was 75.6 &mgr;g C g(-1) h(-1) (74.2-79.1), whereas the mean value for leaves measured under basal conditions was 72.9 &mgr;g C g(-1) h(-1) (64.7-88.9). Between DOY 141 and 240, daily mean isoprene EFs varied from 54 to 96 &mgr;g C g(-1) h(-1) (27 to 49 nmol m(-2) s(-1)). In agreement with previous work at this and other sites, basal isoprene emission rates of fully exposed leaves at the crown apex of this tree were about 20% higher than those of the selected leaves. The length of the period prior to measurement of isoprene emission, during which meteorology was correlated with basal EF, appeared to be related to the timing and periodicity of meteorological change, and probably explains quantitative differences in the length of this period among studies. The empirical equation that we derived for this effect explained variability in midday EFs at the study site, but its general applicability remains to be tested. Strong diurnal changes in EF (as high as a factor of 2) are implied in this study, and should be examined further.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "9c643042b84e09a21242476190184137e5b4befa", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1999842235", "DOI": "10.1029/2003JD003391", "CorpusId": 129365294}, "title": "Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis of a regional\u2010scale transport chemistry model constrained by measurements from the Atmospheric Pollution Over the Paris Area (ESQUIF) campaign", "abstract": "[1]\u00a0A Bayesian Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis constrained by measurements is applied to emission scenario calculations with the chemistry transport model CHIMERE within the Ile-de-France region. The overall uncertainty with respect to the following model input parameters is evaluated: anthropogenic and biogenic emissions, meteorological parameters such as wind speed and mixing layer height, actinic fluxes, quantum yields, and chemical rate coefficients. Airborne and ground-based ozone and nitrogen species, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and wind measurements from the Atmospheric Pollution Over the Paris Area (ESQUIF) campaign are used to construct an agreement function that assigns a larger weight to Monte Carlo simulations closer to observations. The observational constraint reduces the uncertainty in the simulations of daily surface ozone maxima (O3max) and the differential sensitivity of ozone formation (DSO) to NOx and VOC emissions reductions for 3 polluted days in the Ile-de-France region by a factor of between 1.5 and 3. Constrained uncertainties in O3max (expressed as relative differences between the 50th and the 10th or 90th percentiles) range from 15 to 30%, both for a baseline and for a 50% reduced emission scenario. Uncertainty in the DSO averaged over the plume ranges from 4 to 10 ppb. Including the observational constraint in the Monte Carlo analysis shifts the DSO in different directions for different days.
