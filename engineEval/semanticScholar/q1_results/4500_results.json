The reduction of Eu3+ to Eu2+ in air atmosphere was observed in the second synthesis step via the use of NH4H2PO4 and the first-step product CaZrO3:Eu3+ to synthesize CaZr(PO4)2:Eu, which strengthens the evidence linking the tetrahedral anion groups PO4 with the Eu reduction. This reduction mechanism is explained by a charge compensation model. The luminescence measurements indicate that the obtained phosphors exhibit a broad bluish-green fluorescence of Eu2+ and a sharp orange-red emission of Eu3+ on 200\u2013350 nm ultraviolet (UV) excitations. A tunable white luminescence covering the whole visible spectrum is realized based on the gradual reduction of Eu3+ to Eu2+ with increasing the sintering time. The optimal white luminescence excited at 247 nm presents the CIE color coordinates of (0.322, 0.305), a correlated color temperature of 6243 K, and a good thermal stability. Furthermore, energy transfer from Eu2+ to Eu3+ is found in CaZr(PO4)2:Eu.

It is in the interest of both farmers and society that housing systems and management methods are developed to minimise the emission of odour. An odour research programme has been completed in The Netherlands to investigate odour emission from both conventional housing systems and systems designed for low ammonia emission. The aim of this paper is to compare within each animal category the odour emission of a number of swine housing systems and poultry housing systems. Emission measurements including 17 housing systems were carried out at 24 livestock facilities. Results showed that investigated systems with low ammonia emission for fattening pigs and sows were significantly (p<0.025) lower than conventional systems, being 50%, or more, lower. For laying hens and broilers, housing systems with low ammonia emission showed odour emissions that in most cases only differed slightly from conventional systems. Correlations between ammonia and odour concentration (within facilities) did not show a consistent pattern. It is concluded that methods for restriction of emitting (slurry) surface in pig husbandry may reduce both ammonia and odour emission.

The policy costs of an administrative order that is effective to promote emission reductions of large enterprises in China\u2019s current economy could be high, and therefore, it is essential and crucial to establish a market-driven mechanism to help and encourage SMEs to make environmental improvement regarding the cap-and-trade system. In this context, new patterns of emission reduction would have profound impacts on knowledge management (KM) of SMEs, especially on knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we adopt a micro-model to study the behaviors and carbon emissions of SMEs under different scenarios. We find that both trading and sharing of knowledge on carbon emission reduction are conducive to reducing emissions of SMEs in the context of cap-and-trade. Besides, the more the compensation is granted, the more manufacturing firms are willing to share knowledge with partners who have complementary knowledge. Subsidies or rewards on knowledge sharing can be helpful to reduce carbon emission, which may have important implications for public policy to solve the problem of carbon emission reduction of SMEs.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "3f7604f9a064762181e8222d76196741b038d21e", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "6346386", "MAG": "2904315193", "DOI": "10.1021/acscentsci.8b00734", "CorpusId": 59303512, "PubMed": "30693331"}, "title": "High-Performance N2-to-NH3 Conversion Electrocatalyzed by Mo2C Nanorod", "abstract": "The synthesis of NH3 is mainly dominated by the traditional energy-consuming Haber\u2013Bosch process with a mass of CO2 emission.

Such an assessment is currently relevant in view of UNFCCC?s decision to replace the values currently used. An emission metric determines the relative weights of non-CO2 greenhouse gases in obtaining CO2-equivalent emissions. For the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, the UNFCCC has used 100 year global warming potential (GWP) values as reported in IPCC?s Second Assessment Report. For the second commitment period, the UNFCCC has decided to use 100 year GWP values from IPCC?s Fourth Assessment Report. We find that such a change has only a minor impact on (the optimal timing of) global emission reductions and costs. However, using 20 year or 500 year GWPs to value non-CO2 greenhouse gases does result in a significant change in both costs and emission reductions in our model. CO2 reductions are favored over non-CO2 gases when the time horizon of the GWPs is increased. Application of GWPs with time horizons longer than 100 year can increase abatement costs substantially, by about 20% for 500 year GWPs. Surprisingly, we find that implementation of a metric based on a time-dependent global temperature potential does not necessary lead to lower abatement costs. The crucial factor here is how fast non-CO2 emissions can be reduced; if this is limited, the delay in reducing methane emissions cannot be (fully) compensated for later in the century, which increases total abatement costs.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "d773e416dd530ba647e4746ff1d6743a54c49db3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1606427078", "DOI": "10.1007/S11127-009-9525-9", "CorpusId": 26775117}, "title": "What determines UN approval of greenhouse gas emission reduction projects in developing countries?", "abstract": "The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), established by the Kyoto protocol, can generate substantial rents for project participants via the sale of Certified Emission Reductions.

Emission inventories for 2000 and 2015 are used in a global Chemical Transport Model (CTM) to quantify environmental atmospheric impacts with particular focus on the Arctic region. Although we assume that ship emissions continue to increase from 2000 to 2015, reductions are assumed for some chemical components and regions because of implementation of new regulations. Current ship traffic (2000) is estimated to contribute significantly to coastal pollution. Norwegian coastal ship traffic is responsible for more than 1/3 and 1/6 of the Norwegian NOx and SO2 emissions, respectively. For these short-lived components the impact of Norwegian coastal emissions is regionally important. For most components the international ship transportation outside coastal waters dominates the effects. Ship emissions increase wet deposition in Scandinavia with 30\u201350% for nitrate and 10\u201325% for sulfate. In general, coastal regions with prevailing onshore winds show substantial increases in deposition of acid components. Maximum surface increase in ozone is in excess of 10 ppbv. Column ozone increases are also significant. Assuming no changes in nonshipping emissions, scenarios for shipping activities in 2015 lead to more than 20% increase in NO2 from 2000 to 2015 in some coastal areas. Ozone increases are in general small. Wet deposition of acidic species increases up to 10% in areas where current critical loads are exceeded. Regulations limiting the sulfur content in the fuel in the North Sea and English Channel will be an efficient measure to reduce sulfate deposition in nearby coastal regions. The expected oil and gas transport by ships from Norway and northwest Russia, sea transport along the Northern Sea Route and new Norwegian coastal gas power plants will have a significant regional effect by increases of acid deposition in north Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula.

Spatially and temporally resolved emission measurements indicate enhancement due to a longer lifetime of the plasma expanding to a larger size at lower background pressures. Further reduction in pressure down to 10\u22123 Torr resulted in a decrease in signal intensity, as a result of a reduction of collisional excitation of the emission lines which occurs when the plasma plume expands into the ambient atmosphere.

In the 1990s the rates of increase of greenhouse gas concentrations, most notably of methane, were observed to change, for reasons that have yet to be fully determined. This period included the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo and an El Nino warm event, both of which affect biogeochemical processes, by changes in temperature, precipitation and radiation. We examine the impact of these changes in climate on global isoprene emissions and the effect these climate dependent emissions have on the hydroxy radical, OH, the dominant sink for methane. We model a reduction of isoprene emissions in the early 1990s, with a maximum decrease of 40 Tg(C)/yr in late 1992 and early 1993, a change of 9%. This reduction is caused by the cooler, drier conditions following the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. Isoprene emissions are reduced both directly, by changes in temperature and a soil moisture dependent suppression factor, and indirectly, through reductions in the total biomass. The reduction in isoprene emissions causes increases of tropospheric OH which lead to an increased sink for methane of up to 5 Tg(CH4)/year, comparable to estimated source changes over the time period studied. There remain many uncertainties in the emission and oxidation of isoprene which may affect the exact size of this effect, but its magnitude is large enough that it should remain important.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "ad25725d8d84bcca7b763c1c4fae6e1cb31959c7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2013211719", "DOI": "10.1029/2009JG000998", "CorpusId": 128475734}, "title": "Delayed recovery of soil respiration after wetting of dry soil further reduces C losses from a Norway spruce forest soil", "abstract": "[1] This experiment investigated the effects of prolonged summer drought on soil respiration (SR) in a mountainous Norway spruce forest in south Germany. On three manipulation plots we excluded summer throughfall in the years of 2006/2007 and measured SR fluxes in comparison to three control plots. Using radiocarbon measurements we quantified the contribution of rhizosphere (RR) and heterotrophic respiration (HR) to total SR.

To prevent aggregation of the clusters into larger particles, stabilization in gas matrices at cryogenic temperatures, or in scaffolds such as polyphosphates, DNA, peptides or polymers at ambient temperature, has been suggested. Alternatively, zeolites have been proposed to stabilize small ionic silver clusters. The molecular dimensions of the zeolite cages and channels prevent aggregation into larger nanoparticles (because of steric reasons) while the net negative charge of the zeolite lattice, the coordinating properties of the lattice oxygen atoms, and the presence of additional cations play a crucial role in stabilizing cationic clusters and unstable intermediates during reduction. Reduction of silver in zeolites is usually a bulk process that requires reductants, such as hydrogen gas or sodium borohydride, but also g irradiation and visible light can cause reduction. One of the most studied systems is silver-exchanged zeolite A (LTA topology), and several models have been proposed to explain the nature and location of the silver clusters formed in this zeolite upon reduction. Aside from their catalytic properties, oligonuclear silver clusters show particularly bright and stable luminescent properties. However, the existing fluorescence studies about Ag clusters in zeolites are limited to the excitation and emission spectra of bulk powder samples. Here, we report on bright fluorescent (spots in) individual silverexchanged zeolite 3A crystals obtained upon photoactivation using a focused UV irradiation on a fluorescence microscope. Photoactivation of silver has been demonstrated for nanoscale Ag2O particles (and interpreted as a photoreduction process). In our study, the emissive silver material is confined within a zeolite framework, which results in a better control of the type and location of the emissive species formed upon UV irradiation. Silver-cluster-loaded crystals are technologically very attractive\u2014for example, as secondary light sources in fluorescence lamps\u2014because of their high emission intensity, their excellent photostability upon UV irradiation, and their large Stokes shift. Moreover, the space-resolved selective activation of the emission intensity may have important applications in data storage. The emissive zeolite particles used herein were prepared by exchanging zeolite 3Awith (8 1)wt%Ag (fromAgNO3 solutions), followed by heating for one day at 450 8C (see the Supporting Information). The enhanced emission exhibited by the silver-exchanged zeolites after the thermal treatment has been ascribed to two possible causes: 1) to the formation of charge-transfer complexes between the partially (de)hydrated silver ions and the oxygen atoms in the zeolite lattice or 2) to the emissive properties of autoreduced oligoatomic silver clusters that may be formed during the high-temperature treatment. Although this report focuses on the photoactivation of thermally treated Ag zeolites, control experiments performed on not thermally activated Ag zeolites (dried at 110 8C) show an analogous photoactivation behavior (see the supporting Information). Figure 1a(1),b(1) shows typical confocal scanning images of a heat-treated Ag-containing zeolite crystal (roughly 3 ? 3 mm in size) taken under a confocal microscope using a picosecond-pulsed 375 nm excitation source (doubled Ti:Sapphire, Spectra Physics; see the Supporting Information). Figure 1a and 1b were taken at excitation intensities of 10 and 20 Wcm , respectively. Zeolite crystals that were not treated thermally exhibited an emission ten-times-weaker than that of the thermally treated samples. The confocal approach in combination with the pinhole in the emission path (see the Supporting Information) allows the collection of photoemission data from selected parts inside the crystals.

This paper briefly reviews current expectations with regard to physical and biological effects, their potential costs to society, and likely costs of abatement. For a \u201cworst case\u201d scenario it is impossible to assess, in economic terms, the full range of possible non-linear synergistic effects. In the \u201cmost favorable\u201d (although not necessarily \u201clikely\u201d) case (of slow-paced climate change), however, it seems likely that the impacts are within the \u201caffordable\u201d range, at least in the industrialized countries of the world. In the \u201cthird world\u201d the notion of affordability is of doubtful relevance, making the problem of quantitative evaluation almost impossible. We tentatively assess the lower limit of quantifiable climate-induced damages at $30 to $35 per ton of \u201cCO2 equivalent\u201d, worldwide, with the major damages being concentrated in regions most adversely affected by sea-level rise. The non-quantifiable environmental damages are also significant and should by no means be disregarded.The costs and benefits of (1) reducing CFC use and (2) reducing fossil fuel consumption, as a means of abatement, are considered in some detail. This strategy has remarkably high indirect benefits in terms of reduced air pollution damage and even direct cost savings to consumers. The indirect benefits of reduced air pollution and its associated health and environmental effects from fossil-fuel combustion in the industrialized countries range from $20 to $60 per ton of CO2 eliminated. In addition, there is good evidence that modest (e.g. 25%) reductions in CO2 emissions may be achievable by the U.S. (and, by implication, for other countries) by a combination of increased energy efficiency and restructuring that would permit simultaneous direct economic benefits (savings) to energy consumers of the order of $50 per ton of CO2 saved. A higher level of overall emissions reduction \u2014 possibly approaching 50% \u2014 could probably be achieved, at little or not net cost, by taking advantage of these savings.We suggest the use of taxes on fossil fuel extraction (or a carbon tax) as a reasonable way of inducing the structural changes that would be required to achieve significant reduction in energy use and CO2 emissions. To minimize the economic burden (and create a political constituency in support of the approach) we suggest the substitution of resource-based taxes in general for other types of taxes (on labor, income, real estate, or trade) that are now the main sources of government revenue. While it is conceded that it would be difficult to calculate the \u201coptimal\u201d tax on extractive resources, we do not think this is a necessary prerequisite to policy-making.

To understand how the bases and base sequence influence cluster formation, the blue/green emitting clusters that form with the thymine-containing oligonucleotides dT12, dT4C4T4, and dC4T4C4 are discussed. With dT12 and dT4C4T4, variations in the solution pH establish that the clusters associate with the N3 of thymine. The small clusters are bound to the larger DNA template, as demonstrated by fluorescence anisotropy, circular dichroism, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies. For dT4C4T4, FCS studies showed that approximately 50% of the strands are labeled with the fluorescent clusters. Absorption spectra and the gas dependence of the fluorescence show that nonfluorescent clusters also form following the reduction of the silver cation - oligonucleotide conjugates. Fluorescent cluster formation is favored by oxygen, thus indicating that the DNA-bound clusters are partially oxidized. To elaborate the sequence dependence of cluster formation, dC4T4C4 was studied. Cluster formation depends on the oligonucleotide concentration, and higher concentrations favor a red emitting species. A blue/green emissive species dominates at lower concentrations of dC4T4C4, and it has spectroscopic, physical, and chemical properties that are similar to those of the clusters that form with dT12 and dT4C4T4.

Although ruminants have a unique advantage of being able to consume forages and graze lands not suitable for arable cropping, 2% to 12% of the gross energy consumed is converted to enteric CH4 during ruminal digestion, which contributes approximately 6% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, ruminant producers need to find cost-effective ways to reduce emissions while meeting consumer demand for food. This paper provides a critical review of the substantial amount of ruminant CH4-related research published in past decades, highlighting hydrogen flow in the rumen, the microbiome associated with methanogenesis, current and future prospects for CH4 mitigation and insights into future challenges for science, governments, farmers and associated industries. Methane emission intensity, measured as emissions per unit of meat and milk, has continuously declined over the past decades due to improvements in production efficiency and animal performance, and this trend is expected to continue. However, continued decline in emission intensity will likely be insufficient to offset the rising emissions from increasing demand for animal protein. Thus, decreases in both emission intensity (g CH4/animal product) and absolute emissions (g CH4/day) are needed if the ruminant industries continue to grow. Providing producers with cost-effective options for decreasing CH4 emissions is therefore imperative, yet few cost-effective approaches are currently available. Future abatement may be achieved through animal genetics, vaccine development, early life programming, diet formulation, use of alternative hydrogen sinks, chemical inhibitors and fermentation modifiers. Individually, these strategies are expected to have moderate effects (<20% decrease), with the exception of the experimental inhibitor 3-nitrooxypropanol for which decreases in CH4 have consistently been greater (20% to 40% decrease). Therefore, it will be necessary to combine strategies to attain the sizable reduction in CH4 needed, but further research is required to determine whether combining anti-methanogenic strategies will have consistent additive effects. It is also not clear whether a decrease in CH4 production leads to consistent improved animal performance, information that will be necessary for adoption by producers. Major constraints for decreasing global enteric CH4 emissions from ruminants are continued expansion of the industry, the cost of mitigation, the difficulty of applying mitigation strategies to grazing ruminants, the inconsistent effects on animal performance and the paucity of information on animal health, reproduction, product quality, cost-benefit, safety and consumer acceptance.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "42dff94337177be2850e63a615b0a9fc13e14ec9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2073525586", "DOI": "10.1209/0295-5075/83/25001", "CorpusId": 122781160}, "title": "An analytical relation describing the dramatic reduction of the breakdown voltage for the microgap devices", "abstract": "The field-emission\u2013related effects play a significant role in the deviation of the breakdown voltage from that predicted by Paschen's law in the range of micrometer gaps.

Depending on the type of biomass, its processing, and the way it is used in the iron making process, many different scenarios may be considered. Those scenarios should be evaluated and compared from technical, environmental, and economical points of view in order to figure out the best options.

The nanocrystalline nature of samples was confirmed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The samples were further characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). The photoluminescence emissions pointed to the presence of defects related to oxygen vacancies. DFT-based calculations showed that electronic transitions between defect states (which arise due to V1+O and V2+O defects) and the conduction band, as well as impurity states at the bottom of the CB, can lead to emissions in the green and blue regions. Samples were further annealed at higher temperatures of up to 1200 \u00b0C to observe the evolution of defects and its implications for the photophysical characteristics of Nd2Zr2O7. The emission intensity was found to increase with an increase in temperature. The increase in intensity upon annealing at a higher temperature was attributed to a reduction in the concentration of surface defects and cation vacancies as confirmed using positron annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS). Based on positron annihilation gamma-ray coincidence Doppler broadening (CDB) measurements, it was observed that the nature of the defects probed by positrons did not change on annealing but their concentrations significantly changed. This was also reflected in the emission spectra, in which the spectral features remained the same but the intensity increased as the annealing temperature was increased. The value of the direct optical band did not change much either as a function of the annealing temperature, which further supports the trend in the emission spectra. In brief, it can be said that the characteristic emission in Nd2Zr2O7 samples is due to oxygen vacancies, whereas the increase in the emission intensity with temperature is due to a decrease in the concentration of cation vacancies and surface defects, which serve as alternative non-radiative paths.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "cb7cc92982e9c557f5c523f9d8e6cc6b405a97f6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2072958406", "DOI": "10.1243/09544070JAUTO932", "CorpusId": 110457867}, "title": "An experimental study on the performance and exhaust emissions of a diesel engine fuelled with soybean oil methyl ester", "abstract": "Abstract In order to optimize the application of biodiesel for diesel engines, the emissions, fuel economies, and power performances of diesel, soybean oil methyl ester, and its blends with diesel from 10 to 80wt% were compared and analysed by bench tests of a supercharged direct injection (DI) diesel engine.

It focuses on the EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. The core rule of emissions trading is that industries need to cover their emissions with tradable emission rights. There are several options for the government to distribute those rights, basically through a free allocation or an auction. The need to cover emissions with a tradable right gives a financial incentive to firms to choose for the reduction of emissions, of course related to the market price of the tradable right. This price-incentive at the same time urges governments to put in place a sound enforcement approach. One of the characteristics of current emissions trading schemes is that they heavily rely on self-monitoring duties. Nevertheless, the ultimate responsibility to inspect rests on the government.

The SCR reaction over V2O5/Fe2O3\u2013TiO2 mainly followed the Eley\u2013Rideal mechanism (i.e. the reaction between activated ammonia species and gaseous NO). There were two active components on V2O5/WO3\u2013TiO2 for the activation of adsorbed NH3 (i.e. V5+ and Fe3+). The acid sites on V2O5/Fe2O3\u2013TiO2 mainly resulted from the support Fe2O3\u2013TiO2, so the adsorbed NH3 preferred to be activated by Fe3+ rather than by V5+. V5+ on V2O5/Fe2O3\u2013TiO2 could accelerate the regeneration of Fe3+ on Fe2O3\u2013TiO2 due to the rapid electron transfer between V5+ and Fe2+ on the surface, so the activation of adsorbed NH3 by Fe3+ was promoted. As some NH3 adsorbed on V2O5/Fe2O3\u2013TiO2 was not activated by Fe3+, the inactivated NH3 could then be activated by V5+ on the surface.

However, current and future Diesel concepts are intrinsically noisy, and thus in the past few years, combustion noise was considered as an additional factor in engine development alongside performance, emissions and driveability. Otherwise, due to this negative issue intrinsic to Diesel combustion, end-users could be reluctant to drive Diesel-powered vehicles and their potential for environment preservation could thus be lost or underused. Evaluation procedures are then required, both for noise level and sound quality, that may be integrated into the global engine development process, avoiding the need to resort to long and expensive acoustic tests. In this paper, such a procedure, based on the noise source diagnostic through the definition of suitable components extracted from in-cylinder pressure, is proposed and validated. An innovative decomposition of the in-cylinder pressure signal is used to obtain such components, so that features associated with the excitation inside the cylinder may be properly identified. These combustion components, significant of the rate of heat release in the cylinder and the resonance in the combustion chamber, may be correlated with the overall noise level.

Our results show that DMPP and DMPSA are equally efficient at reducing N2O emissions under 40% WFPS conditions by inhibiting bacterial ammonia oxidation. In contrast, at 80% WFPS DMPSA was less efficient than DMPP at reducing N2O emissions. Interestingly, at 80% WFPS, where lowered oxygen availability limits nitrification, both DMPP and DMPSA not only inhibited nitrification but also stimulated N2O reduction to molecular nitrogen (N2) via nitrous oxide reductase activity (Nos activity).

Activity data were collected for building energy use, travel and procurement. Established emissions factors were applied to reconcile this data to carbon dioxide equivalents (CO(2)eq) per year.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe Dorset Renal Service has a carbon footprint of 3006 tonnes CO(2)eq per annum, of which 381 tonnes CO(2)eq (13% of overall emissions) result from building energy use, 462 tonnes CO(2)eq from travel (15%) and 2163 tonnes CO(2)eq (72%) from procurement.

The primary objective of this study was to analyze \u201ccylinder throttling\u201d via both delayed and advanced intake valve closure timing. The effect of cylinder throttling on exhaust gas temperatures, fuel consumption, in-cylinder combustion and emissions is outlined. A significant increase in turbine outlet temperature accompanied by a decrease in fuel consumption, NOx, and particulate matter emissions was observed. Both delayed and advanced intake valve closure timings were equally effective. The increase in exhaust gas temperatures was attributed to a drop in air flow through the engine, which resulted from a reduction in the volumetric efficiency via cylinder throttling. The increase in fuel efficiency resulted from a decrease in the pumping work through a reduction in air flow through the engine. Reductions in NOx are attributed to the combined effect of a lower in-cylinder temperature due to a reduction in piston-motion-induced compression and a shift to a more premixed combustion mode. Particulate matter emissions were also reduced as a result of additional premixing. At the 1200 RPM and 2.5 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) operating point, both delayed and advanced intake valve closure timings resulted in a turbine outlet temperature increase from 195\u2009\u00b0C to 255\u2009\u00b0C accompanied by an increase in brake thermal efficiency of 1.5% (absolute) and a reduction in brake-specific NOx and particulate matter emissions by 40% and 30%, respectively.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "983dfb7fdb15e8a324da3302c7524b53f71a3bb7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2057663784", "DOI": "10.1023/B:MITI.0000038845.44341.BB", "CorpusId": 154807708}, "title": "Importance of Sulfate Aerosol in Evaluating the Relative Contributions of Regional Emissions to the Historical Global Temperature Change", "abstract": "During the negotiations of the KyotoProtocol the delegation of Brazil presentedan approach for distributing the burden ofemissions reductions among the Partiesbased on the effect of their cumulativehistorical emissions on the global-averagenear-surface temperature.

The use of oxygenated fuels has been proposed as a means of complying with future emission levels. Previous research on oxygenates has suggested the presence of molecular oxygen within the fuel significantly reduces the formation of particulate matter (PM). The PM reduction is logarithmic and correlates with the weight percent of oxygen in the fuel and not with other properties such as chemical structure and volatility. However, many studies fail to correctly decouple the effects of oxygenates from other fuel properties that impact emission levels; such as cetane number, density, aromatic content, and volatility. Mechanisms responsible for changes in the combustion process and emissions were investigated with a matrix containing 14 fuels, addressing oxygenate proportionality, structure, volatility, equivalent structure without oxygen, and changes in the base diesel fuel. A scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) was used to evaluate changes in particle size distributions, in addition to gravimetric filter and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) measurements. Engine emissions tests were conducted using a Ricardo Hydra MK IV direct injection (DI) diesel engine. The sensitivity of engine operation parameters to intake temperature, load, injection timing, and ignition delay (ID) were evaluated with the baseline fuel. All fuels in the matrix were matched for total released energy and combustion phasing, using a cetane improving additive. The changes in emission have been quantified with agreement between the relative trends observed with the integrated SMPS volume concentrations and filter measurements. In order to evaluate changes among fuels and measurements taken with the SMPS, various fuels were subjected to physical and chemical characterization in order to determine morphological and compositional changes.

From 2013-2017, China's mercury emissions decreased from 571 to 444 tons, resulting in a 0.29 ng m-3 decrease in the TGM concentration, on average, and in a 17 \u03bcg m-2 yr-1 decrease in FLX.

As a result of this successful measure, coal-fired power plants are no longer the main mercury emitters.

However, in terms of the mitigated TGM concentration and FLX levels per unit emission abatement, newly built wet flue gas desulfurization (WFGD) systems in coal-fired industrial boilers have become particularly effective in decreasing FLX levels.

This reduced inflows to the Perth water supply by about 120 GL (42%) and led to an acceleration of projects to develop new water sources at a cost of about $300 million. The reduction in rainfall was coincident with warmer temperatures. A major analysis of these changes indicated that the changes in temperature were likely caused by the enhanced greenhouse effect and that the changes in rainfall were likely caused by a large-scale reorganization of the atmospheric circulation. We explore an alternative hypothesis that large-scale land cover change explains the observed changes in rainfall and temperature. We use three high-resolution mesoscale model configurations forced at the boundaries to simulate (for each model) five July climates for each of natural and current land cover. We find that land cover change explains up to 50% of the observed warming. Following land cover change, we also find, in every simulation, a reduction in rainfall over southwest Western Australia and an increase in rainfall inland that matches the observations well. We show that the reduced surface roughness following land cover change largely explains the simulated changes in rainfall by increasing moisture divergence over southwest Western Australia and increasing moisture convergence inland. Increased horizontal wind magnitudes and suppressed vertical velocities over southwest Western Australia reduce the likelihood of precipitation. Inland, moisture convergence and increased vertical velocities lead to an increase in rainfall. Our results indicate that rainfall over southwest Western Australia may be returned to the long-term average through large-scale reforestation, a policy option within the control of local government.

Introduction The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has set aggressive goals for reducing emissions of future aircraft by a factor of three within 10 years and by a factor of five within 20 years. Thus, the Ultra-Efficient Engine Technology (UEET) Program addresses local air quality concerns by developing technologies to reduce both takeoff and landing NO x emissions by 70% from the 1996 International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards. Advanced concepts research for reducing carbon dioxide and NO x , as well as analytical/ experimental research in control (through component design, control, and/or fuel additives) of aircraft exhaust emissions is sought.

Virtually unchecked greenhouse gas emissions to date (combined with the inertia of the coupled natural and human systems) may have already committed future societies to a widespread demise of coral reefs.

The current study is the first to perform relatively complete chemical speciation on the real-world reduction in primary PM emissions from heavy-duty trucks at a major shipping port during the implementation of a retrofit and replacement program. Measurements of fine PM composition at the Port were analyzed by using positive matrix factorization (PMF) to identify five dominant PM sources: shipping, port truck traffic, distant on-road traffic, background sea spray, and road dust. Changes to port truck traffic-related PM concentration on days with similar meteorological conditions during and after implementation of the controls were used as a direct indication of emissions reductions. Primary PM mass emissions from port trucks decreased by 75% due to the control program, which meets the targets inherent in the Emission Reduction Plan for Ports and Goods Movement in California. Contributions of PM components attributed to port truck activities decreased by amounts ranging from 66% to 87% (elemental carbon (EC) = 66%, organic carbon (OC) = 78%, Na = 82%, Ba = 84%, Fe = 87%). These reductions include contributions from both tailpipe emissions and brake/tire wear. Prior to implementation of the control program, port trucks accounted for approximately 56% of the ambient EC concentrations in the vicinity of the Port while ships accounted for approximately 12% of the EC concentrations. After implementation of the control program, port trucks and ships accounted for approximately 23% and 29% of the ambient EC concentrations at the Port, respectively. The current study provides an example of how emissions control programs at other major shipping ports in the United States could lower overall emissions.

Aerosol variations and trends over different land and ocean regions from 1980 to 2009 are analyzed with the Goddard Chemistry Aerosol Radiation and Transport (GOCART) model and observations from multiple satellite sensors and available ground-based networks. Excluding time periods with large volcanic influence, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and surface concentration over polluted land regions generally vary with anthropogenic emissions, but the magnitude of this association can be dampened by the presence of natural aerosols, especially dust. Over the 30-year period in this study, the largest reduction in aerosol levels occurs over Europe, where AOD has decreased by 40\u201360% on average and surface sulfate concentrations have declined by a factor of up to 3\u20134. In contrast, East Asia and South Asia show AOD increases, but the relatively high level of dust aerosols in Asia reduces the correlation between AOD and pollutant emission trends. Over major dust source regions, model analysis indicates that the change of dust emissions over the Sahara and Sahel has been predominantly driven by the change of near-surface wind speed, but over Central Asia it has been largely influenced by the change of the surface wetness. The decreasing dust trend in the North African dust outflow region of the tropical North Atlantic and the receptor sites of Barbados and Miami is closely associated with an increase of the sea surface temperature in the North Atlantic. This temperature increase may drive the decrease of the wind velocity over North Africa, which reduces the dust emission, and the increase of precipitation over the tropical North Atlantic, which enhances dust removal during transport. Despite significant trends over some major continental source regions, the model-calculated global annual average AOD shows little change over land and ocean in the past three decades, because opposite trends in different land regions cancel each other out in the global average, and changes over large open oceans are negligible. This highlights the necessity for regional-scale assessment of aerosols and their climate impacts, as global-scale average values can obscure important regional changes.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "220419ca63b04e138102b6948ae25b2fa7ee9fcf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1983761458", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.0705036104", "CorpusId": 6410845, "PubMed": "18003925"}, "title": "Maternal family history of Alzheimer's disease predisposes to reduced brain glucose metabolism", "abstract": "Having a parent affected with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a risk factor for developing AD among cognitively normal subjects.

In this study, the effects of different aeration conditions on the dynamics of the emission of trace gases (CO2, N2O, CH4) and the leachate composition (NO3-, DOC, Mn, Fe) were determined. The experiment was conducted with naturally structured soil columns (silty clay, Vertisol) from a well aerated forest site. The soil monoliths were incubated in a microcosm system at different O2 concentrations (0, 0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, and 0.205 m3 m-3 in the air flow through the headspace of the microcosms) for 85 days. Reduced O2 availability resulted in a decreased CO2 release but in increased N2O emission rates. The greatest cumulative N2O emissions (= 1.6 g N2O-N m-2) were observed at intermediate O2 concentrations (0.005 and 0.01 m3 m-3) when both nitrification and denitrification occurred simultaneously in the soil. Cumulative N2O emissions were smallest (= 0.05 g N2O-N m-2) for the aeration with ambient air (O2 concentration: 0.205 m3 m-3), although nitrate availability was greatest in this treatment. The emission of CH4 and leaching of Mn and Fe were restricted to the soil columns incubated under completely anoxic conditions. The sequence of the reduction processes under completely anoxic conditions complied with the thermodynamic theory: soil nitrate was reduced first, followed by the reduction of Mn(IV) and Fe(III) and finally CO2 was reduced to CH4. The re-aeration of the soil columns after 85 days of anoxic incubation terminated the production of CH4 and dissolved Fe and Mn in the soil but strongly increased the emission rates of CO2 and N2O and the leaching of NO3- probably because of the accumulation of DOC and NH4+ during the previous anoxic period.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "12cf7ba5ee8e0451b1f7849f5c0d5bb83ac71640", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1576842466", "DOI": "10.4271/971659", "CorpusId": 94264150}, "title": "The Dilution, Chemical, and Thermal Effects of Exhaust Gas Recirculation on Diesel Engine Emissions - Part 3: Effects of Water Vapour", "abstract": "Water vapour is a main constituent of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) in diesel engines and its influence on combustion and emissions were investigated. The following effects of the water vapour were examined experimentally: the effect of replacing part of the inlet charge oxygen (dilution effect), the effect of the higher specific heat capacity of water vapour in comparison with that of oxygen it replaces (thermal effect), the effect of dissociation of water vapour (chemical effect), as well as the overall effect of water vapour on combustion and emissions. Water vapour was introduced into the inlet charge, progressively, so that up to 3 percent of the inlet charge mass was displaced. This was equivalent to the amount of water vapour contained in 52 percent by mass of EGR for the engine operating condition tested in this work. The introduction of water vapour in the inlet charge resulted in a slight increase in the ignition delay, and a slight decrease in the peak cylinder gas pressure and temperature. The reduction in NOx emissions was mainly due to the dilution of the inlet charge with water vapour while the higher specific heat capacity had a considerable effect too. The separate effects of water vapour on the unburnt hydrocarbon emissions (UHC) were minor, whereas the overall effect was relatively substantial. The introduction of water vapour resulted in an increase in the particulate and smoke emissions. Part of this increase was due to the dilution effect of the inlet charge with water vapour. The algebraic addition of the dilution, the chemical, and the thermal effects on the UHC and the volatile fraction of the particulates was not equal to the overall effect of water vapour. This indicated that there might be an additional (but not identified) effect that increased the volatile organic fraction as well as the UHC emissions. Alternatively, it is suggested that the sum of the separate dilution, chemical, and thermal effects of water vapour on, for example, ignition delay and, thereby, emissions may be different from that of the overall effect of water vapour on ignition delay and emissions.

Traffic volumes, obtained through a simulation approach, were used as input parameters for a noise emission assessment conducted using the CNOSSOS-EU method, and an overall noise emissions reduction on the entire road network was found, even if its extent varied between road types.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "a69943301f3582ff3565ebdc7832d5725d11acab", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1547018909", "DOI": "10.1038/17946", "CorpusId": 4336275}, "title": "Pasture damage by an Amazonian earthworm", "abstract": "Almost all cultivated soils undergo some reduction in the porosity of the surface layers, and nowhere is this more evident than in tropical rainforests that have been converted to pastures. Following deforestation in an area of Costa Rica, soil bulk density has been shown to increase rapidly after conversion to pasture, leading to poor drainage and a reduced rate of gaseous diffusion. These factors limit methane consumption and promote the anaerobic production of methane. A similar effect on methane flux has been found in upland soils in the Brazilian Amazonian basin after conversion from forest to pasture,. Increases in atmospheric methane are therefore not limited to emissions from flooded soils, as forest-to-pasture conversion promotes the anaerobic mineralization of organic matter by changing the physical properties of soil.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "eba09ebbb86e7681b7ce57618c560cf979876855", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2579327082", "CorpusId": 131802204}, "title": "From Laboratory to Road.

The 2015 target of 130 grams of CO2 per kilometer (g/km) was met two years ahead of schedule and manufacturers are making good progress towards the 2020/21 target of 95 g/km.

The basis for the regulation are results obtained under laboratory conditions using the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC)\u2014the so-called certification or \u201ctype-approval\u201d values. To make real progress, however, the results recorded in the laboratory must translate dependably into CO2 reductions and fuel-consumption savings experienced on the road. This study, which builds on and extends the analysis begun in 2012 and continued in 2013, demonstrates that the year-over-year improvements reported via the type-approval tests are not reliably matched in everyday driving\u2014and that the gap between the vehicle emissions testing laboratory and the real world of the road is getting wider.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "4a00441711ecc9c735d1e3e936750b8c874bc7ad", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1968655088", "DOI": "10.1073/PNAS.83.14.5121", "CorpusId": 25064835, "PubMed": "16593728"}, "title": "Femtosecond spectroscopy of excitation energy transfer and initial charge separation in the reaction center of the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas viridis.", "abstract": "Reaction centers from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas viridis have been excited within the near-infrared absorption bands of the dimeric primary donor (P), of the \"accessory\" bacteriochlorophylls (B), and of the bacteriopheophytins (H) by using laser pulses of 150-fsec duration. The transfer of excitation energy between H, B, and P occurs in slightly less than 100 fsec and leads to the ultrafast formation of an excited state of P. This state is characterized by a broad absorption spectrum and exhibits stimulated emission. It decays in 2.8 +/- 0.2 psec with the simultaneous oxidation of the primary donor and reduction of the bacteriopheophytin acceptor, which have been monitored at 545, 675, 815, 830, and 1310 nm. Although a transient bleaching relaxing in 400 +/- 100 fsec is specifically observed upon excitation and observation in the 830-nm absorption band, we have found no indication that an accessory bacteriochlorophyll is involved as a resolvable intermediary acceptor in the primary electron transfer process.", "year": 1986}]}
