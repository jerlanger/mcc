The solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC) is one of the most exciting of these energy technologies; it is an all-ceramic device that operates at temperatures in the range 500\u20131,000 \u00b0C. The SOFC offers certain advantages over lower temperature fuel cells, notably its ability to use carbon monoxide as a fuel rather than being poisoned by it, and the availability of high-grade exhaust heat for combined heat and power, or combined cycle gas-turbine applications. Although cost is clearly the most important barrier to widespread SOFC implementation, perhaps the most important technical barriers currently being addressed relate to the electrodes, particularly the fuel electrode or anode. In terms of mitigating global warming, the ability of the SOFC to use commonly available fuels at high efficiency, promises an effective and early reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and hence is one of the lead new technologies for improving the environment.

These experiments allowed us to study the impact of pulverized coal fineness and burnout air position on emission under both deep and shallow air-staged combustion conditions. We also studied the impact of char-nitrogen release on both the burning-out process of the pulverized coal and the corresponding carbon content in fly ash. We found that air-staged combustion affects a pronounced reduction in NOx emissions from the combustion of anthracite coal. The more the air is staged, the more NOx emission is reduced. In shallow air-staged combustion (f{sub M} = 0.85), the fineness of the pulverized coal strongly influences emissions, and finer coals result in lower emissions. Meanwhile, the burnout air position has only a weak effect. In the deep air-staged combustion (f{sub M} = 0.6), the effect of coal fineness is smaller, and the burnout air position has a stronger effect. When the primary combustion air is stable, NOx emissions increase with increasing burnout air. This proves that, in the burnout zone, coal char is responsible for the discharge of fuel-nitrogen that is oxidized to NOx. The measurementmore\u00a0\u00bb of secondary air staging in a burnout zone can help inhibit the oxidization of NO caused by nitrogen release. Air-staged combustion has little effect on the burnout of anthracite coal, which proves to be suitable for air-staged combustion. 31 refs., 11 figs., 1 tab.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "387be4903161833c83a2fce6199e8827731250a6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3009590209", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.9b07248", "CorpusId": 212406809, "PubMed": "32126767"}, "title": "Persistent heavy winter nitrate pollution driven by increased photochemical oxidants in northern China.", "abstract": "Nitrate is an increasingly important component of PM2.5 during winter in northern China.

Here, we use extensive observations and a model with state-of-the-art nitrogen chemistry to identify the key factors that control the nitrate formation in the heavily polluted North China Plain (NCP). In contrast to the previous view of weak winter photochemistry, we show that the O3 and OH productions are sufficiently high in winter to facilitate fast gas-phase and heterogeneous conversion of NOX to nitrate over the NCP. Increasing O3 and OH productions from higher precursor levels and fast ROX cycling accelerate the nitrate generation during heavy pollution. We find that the 31.8% reduction of NOX emissions from 2010 to 2017 in the NCP lowers surface nitrate by only 0.2%, and even increases nitrate in some polluted areas. This is mainly due to the increase of O3 and OH (by ~30%), which has subsequently increased the conversion efficiency of NOX to HNO3 (by 38.7%).

The model simulation is evaluated with a suite of surface and aircraft observations over the United States from the summer of 1995. The model reproduces the principal features in the observed distributions of O3 and its precursors, including frequency distributions of O3 concentrations and the development of regional high-O3 episodes in the eastern United States. Comparison of simulations with 1995 versus 1980 global fossil fuel emissions indicates that the model captures the previously observed decrease in the high end of the O3 probability distribution in surface air over the United States (reflecting reduction of domestic hydrocarbon emissions) and the increase in the low end (reflecting, at least in the model, rising Asian emissions).

With the increasing demand of less greenhouse gas emissions, the current diesel engine fuel efficiency remains unsatisfactory partially due to the conflict between the engine fuel efficiency and engine-out NOx emissions. While advanced aftertreatment systems, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems or lean NOx trap, have been integrated to diesel engines for reducing the tailpipe NOx emissions, the integrated controls for coordinating diesel engine and SCR system to achieve high engine efficiency and low tailpipe emissions are still limited. The purpose of this study is to develop such an integrated diesel engine and SCR system control method using nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) approach with both start of injection (SOI) timing and urea solution injection rate as the control inputs. Control-oriented engine models were developed to quantify the influences of SOI timing on engine efficiency and engine-out NOx emissions.

This regulation requires an operator to fix all detected leaks within a set time period. Whether such 'find-all-fix-all' policies are effective depends on significant uncertainties in the character of emissions. In this work, we systematically analyze the effect of facility-related and mitigation-related uncertainties on regulation effectiveness. Drawing from multiple publicly-available datasets, we find that: (1) highly-skewed leak-size distributions strongly influence emissions reduction potential; (2) variations in emissions estimates across facilities leads to large variability in mitigation effectiveness; (3) emissions reductions from optical gas imaging-based leak detection programs can range from 15% to over 70%; and (4) while implementation costs are uniformly lower than EPA estimates, benefits from saved gas are highly variable. Combining empirical evidence with model results, we propose four policy options for effective methane mitigation: performance-oriented targets for accelerated emission reductions, flexible policy mechanisms to account for regional variation, technology-agnostic regulations to encourage adoption of the most cost-effective measures, and coordination with other greenhouse gas mitigation policies to reduce unintended spillover effects.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "dcb09898a76369451b55f98c2126e1bd33b12caa", "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "astro-ph/0410136", "MAG": "2952268176", "DOI": "10.1086/432092", "CorpusId": 19965900}, "title": "Chandra Orion Ultradeep Project: Observations and Source Lists", "abstract": "We present a description of the data reduction methods and the derived catalog of more than 1600 X-ray point sources from the exceptionally deep 2003 January Chandra X-Ray Observatory (Chandra) observation of the Orion Nebula Cluster and embedded populations around OMC-1.

This paper applies a systems model to telework and nontelework scenarios in order to quantify greenhouse gas and other air emissions from transportation, heating, cooling, lighting, and electronic and electrical equipment use both at the company and the home office. Using United States data, a WWW-based, scalable decision-support tool was created to evaluate the environmental impacts of teleworkers. For a typical case reflecting United States teleworker patterns, the analysis found that telework has the potential to reduce air emissions. However, Monte Carlo simulation employed to perform a probabilistic analysis over a set of likely parameters has revealed that telework may not affect equally the emissions of all types of pollutants. It may decrease CO2, NOx, SO2, PM10, and CO but not N2O and CH4 emissions. Therefore, the scope and goal of telework programs must be defined early in the implementation process. Work-related transportation (commuting) impacts could be reduced as a result of telework; however, home-related impacts due to an employee spending additional time at home could potentially offset these reductions. Company office-related impacts may not be reduced unless the office space is shared with other employees during telework days or eliminated entirely. In states with high telework potential (California, Georgia, Illinois, New York, Texas), telework could save emissions, but it would depend on commuting and climatic patterns and the electricity mix.

We use the energy-systems optimization model MESSAGE considering endogenous learning for various technologies, such that they experience cost reductions as a function of accumulated capacity installations. We find that the existence of technological learning while reducing overall energy system costs becomes particularly important in the context of a long-term climate policy. Diversity in technological portfolios is emphasized and results indicate deployment of a range of energy technologies in reducing emissions. An important finding is that technological learning by itself is not sufficient for climate stabilization and that climate policies are an absolute necessary complimentary element. Under a climate constraint, spillovers across technologies and regions due to learning results in increased upfront investments and hence lower costs of carbon free technologies, thus resulting in technology deployment and emissions reductions, especially in developing countries. We conclude that learning and spillover effects can lead to technologically advanced cost-effective global energy transition pathways.

Moreover, the addition of an electron scavenger quenches the PbSe/CdSe emission, while a hole scavenger does not. This implies that the electron wave function reaches the QD surface, while the hole is confined to the PbSe core.

This paper discusses the pros and cons of the approach, and provides an assessment of the approach with respect to leakage, non-permanence, forest degradation, uncertainties of baseline estimates, incentives to improve land use, and scale of credits. The paper also presents some suggested refi nements and addresses monitoring needs. Introduction Global deforestation and forest degradation rates have a signifi cant impact on the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere (Achard et al. 2002; Houghton 2003; Fearnside and Laurance 2004). The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO 2001) estimated that during the 1990s 16.1 million ha per year were affected by deforestation, most of them in the tropics. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calculated that for the same period the contribution of land-use changes to GHG accumulation into the atmosphere was 1.6\u00b10.8 Giga (1 G = 10) tonnes of carbon per year (Prentice et al. 2001), a quantity that corresponds to 25% of the total annual global emissions of GHGs. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), in recognizing climate change as a serious threat, urged countries to take up measures to enhance and conserve ecosystems such as forests that act as reservoirs and sinks of GHGs. The Kyoto Protocol (KP), adopted in 1997, complements the UNFCCC by providing an enforceable agreement with quantitative targets for reducing GHG emissions. To fulfi ll their emission-limitation commitments under the KP, industrialized countries (listed in the KP\u2019s Annex I) can use land-based activities, such as reducing deforestation, establishing new forests (afforestation and reforestation) and other vegetation types, managing agricultural and forestlands in a way that the \u201ccarbon sink\u201d is maximized. Annex I countries may also claim credit for carbon sequestration in developing countries by afforestation and reforestation (AR) through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), one of the Kyoto mechanisms that allow countries to achieve reductions where it is economically effi cient to do so. For the period 2008-12, forestry activities under the CDM have been restricted to afforestation and reforestation on areas that were not forested in 1990. In addition, CDM projects must lead to emission reductions or net carbon uptake additional to what would have occurred without the CDM funding. Annex I Parties can only use credits from AR CDM up to an annual 1% of their base-year emission, or 5% during the entire Kyoto commitment period. In December 2003, the ninth session to the Conference of the Parties (COP9) to the UNFCCC took a decision addressing the contentious issue of non-permanence\u2014 as well as additionality, leakage, uncertainties, and socioeconomic and environmental impacts\u2014associated with AR project activities under the CDM (UNFCCC 2003). 28 | Should We Include Avoidance of Deforestation? Only expiring carbon credits will be issued from AR CDM projects (\u201ctemporary\u201d or \u201clong-term\u201d Certifi ed Emission Reductions (CERs) alternatively), so that credits expire before termination of the project, or when the carbon is released back to the atmosphere prematurely. In both cases, the investor that used the credits to get into compliance will be debited accordingly. The decision also acknowledges that is up to host Parties to evaluate risks associated with AR projects, such as the use of invasive alien species and genetically modifi ed organisms, according to their national laws. The text of the decision also invites Parties\u2019 submissions on simplifi ed modalities and procedures for small-scale projects and their implementation. In contrast, activities aimed at reversing or slowing deforestation in developing countries are excluded for the fi rst commitment period of the KP (2008-2012). Arguments against allowing deforestation avoidance activities were high uncertainties of GHG-reduction estimates, the potentially large scale of credits, non-permanence, and leakage concerns (Bonnie et al. 2000; Marland et al. 2001). The compensated reduction proposal At a COP9 side event, Santilli et al. (2003a) presented a new proposal to include deforestation avoidance in tropical countries under the KP. The proposal labelled \u201ccompensated reduction\u201d includes as its main element a voluntary national deforestation stabilization and reduction target for non-Annex I countries such as Brazil or Indonesia. Its objective is to encourage conservation policies. If these policies prove successful by the end of the fi rst commitment period, the respective carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) reductions, once monitored and verifi ed, can be sold to industrialized countries after the end of the fi rst commitment period at the carbon market prices prevailing at that time (Santilli et al. 2003b). The proposed baseline for Brazil would be the average emissions from deforestation during the 1980s (Santilli et al., 2003a), or the 1990s (Santilli et al. 2003b). For other countries, other baseline periods might be adequate. Who would be the buyers of these credits? While one paper talks of \u201cgovernments or private investors\u201d (Santilli et al. 2003b), the other one stresses that \u201c...this would not be a market mechanism like the CDM [...], but an agreement between governments\u201d (Santilli et al. 2003b). Even in this latter case, the authors see these credits as being transferred through international emissions trading markets. Voluntary markets are emerging and other ecosystem services such as biodiversity values may be bundled. Emission credits may not be the primary objective as private sectors are also eager to build their image to society. In addition, public funding, although relatively small has yet to be mobilized. No substantial efforts have been made regarding the Special Climate Change Fund and the Adaptation Fund under the UNFCCC managed by the Global Environment Facility. The host country would adhere to a binding, sectoral emission-limitation target by agreeing not to increase or further reduce deforestation-related emissions in the future. Obviously any increase in GHG emissions above the target would reverse credits already sold to Annex I countries, and thus result in non-compliance with this voluntary, but once agreed, binding emission-limitation target. Schlamadinger et al. | 29 The proposal was cautiously supported by representatives of the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment at the COP9 side event, which is signifi cant because Brazil had opposed the inclusion of deforestation avoidance in previous negotiating sessions. The proposal re-opened the debate about the inclusion of deforestation avoidance among the possible measures for reaching KP targets by Annex I countries. The \u201ccompensated reduction proposal\u201d is similar to the way deforestation is addressed in the case of Australia (an Annex I country) under Articles 3.3 and 3.7 of the Protocol, based on \u201cnet-net accounting.\u201d In this approach, the emissions from deforestation in the commitment period are compared to those in 1990, and any reduction in deforestation emissions will bring the country closer to compliance with its Kyoto targets. Pros and cons of the proposal It may be argued that the proposal might lead to inclusion of \u201chot air\u201d in the Kyoto system, to the extent that actual emissions\u2014even without efforts to reduce them\u2014may be less than the base-year emissions or a baseline calculated in other ways. We believe that such hot air, to a limited extent, is inevitable, and occurs in many situations under the KP. What is essential is that the proposal provides a real incentive, at the margin of the no-interference situation, to reduce deforestation. Nevertheless, efforts should be taken to calculate the baseline such that it minimizes hot air to the extent possible, while not creating too much risk of \u201cnon-compliance\u201d of the countries concerned. Moreover, deforestation avoidance is already accounted for in the KP inventories of Annex I countries. Incentives to reduce deforestation at the margin of the current rate are not present in all cases (there is no incentive in some cases where special accounting rules have been introduced for other reasons). However, a point can be made that deforestation avoidance in developing countries would be a much more powerful str", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "9e3f6577e505746f3a7fef32de081c56181d5aea", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2904663182", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.8b05535", "CorpusId": 58603116, "PubMed": "30566833"}, "title": "Methane Emission Reductions from the Alternate Wetting and Drying of Rice Fields Detected Using the Eddy Covariance Method.", "abstract": "Rice cultivation contributes 11% of the global 308 Tg CH4 anthropogenic emissions.

Approximately 65% of anthropogenic emissions of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas (GHG), originate from soils at a global scale, and particularly after N fertilisation of the main crops in Europe. Thanks to their capacity to fix atmospheric N2 through biological fixation, legumes can reduce N fertilizer use, and possibly N2O emissions. Nevertheless, the decomposition of crop organic matter during the crop cycle and residue decomposition, and possibly the N fixation process itself, could lead to N2O emissions. The objective of this study was to quantify N2O emissions from a dry pea crop (Pisum sativum, harvested at maturity) and from the subsequent crops in comparison with N2O emissions from wheat and oilseed rape crops, fertilized or not, in various rotations. A field experiment was conducted over 4 consecutive years to compare the emissions during the pea crop, in comparison with those during the wheat (fertilized or not) or oilseed rape crops, and after the pea crop, in comparison with other preceding crops. N2O fluxes were measured using static chambers. In spite of low N2O fluxes, mainly due to the site's soil characteristics, fluxes during the crop were significantly lower for pea and unfertilized wheat than for fertilized wheat and oilseed rape. The effect of the preceding crop was not significant, while soil mineral N at harvest was higher after the pea crop. These results should be confirmed over a wider range of soil types. Nevertheless, they demonstrate the absence of N2O emissions linked to the symbiotic N fixation process, and allow us to estimate the decrease in N2O emissions by 20\u201325% through including one pea crop in a three-year rotation. On a larger scale, this reduction of GHG emissions at field level has to be added to the decrease due to the reduced production and transport of the N fertilizer not applied to the pea crop.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "cba22c7876213631bfdd1f0062e20a6b08474b72", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1529106462", "CorpusId": 210028557}, "title": "The Right to Development in a Climate Constrained World: The Greenhouse Development Rights Framework", "abstract": "The climate crisis does not come to us alone, but rather amidst worsening social and economic turbulence.

For the most stringent stabilization case (\u201cLevel 1\u201d with CO2 concentration stabilizing at about 450\u00a0ppm), peak CO2 emissions occur close to today, implying (in the absence of a substantial CO2 concentration overshoot) a need for immediate CO2 emissions abatement if we wish to stabilize at this level.

Environmental chamber (\"smog chamber\") experiments were conducted to investigate secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production from dilute emissions from two medium-duty diesel vehicles (MDDVs) and three heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs) under urban-like conditions. Some of the vehicles were equipped with emission control aftertreatment devices, including diesel particulate filters (DPFs), selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs). Experiments were also performed with different fuels (100% biodiesel and low-, medium- or high-aromatic ultralow sulfur diesel) and driving cycles (Unified Cycle,~Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule, and creep + idle). During normal operation, vehicles with a catalyzed DPF emitted very little primary particulate matter (PM). Furthermore, photooxidation of dilute emissions from these vehicles produced essentially no SOA (below detection limit). However, significant primary PM emissions and SOA production were measured during active DPF regeneration experiments. Nevertheless, under reasonable assumptions about DPF regeneration frequency, the contribution of regeneration emissions to the total vehicle emissions is negligible, reducing PM trapping efficiency by less than 2%. Therefore, catalyzed DPFs appear to be very effective in reducing both primary PM emissions and SOA production from diesel vehicles. For both MDDVs and HDDVs without aftertreatment substantial SOA formed in the smog chamber \u2013 with the emissions from some vehicles generating twice as much SOA as primary organic aerosol after 3 h of oxidation at typical urban VOC / NOx ratios (3 : 1). Comprehensive organic gas speciation was performed on these emissions, but less than half of the measured SOA could be explained by traditional (speciated) SOA precursors.

Loss to the environment can be avoided by manufacturing and handling the feed in a pelletized form that will minimize waste and improve feed/gain. Other strategies for minimizing nutrient losses include: 1) the development of feeding programs that are specific for sex and strain of the animal; 2) increasing the number of feed phases to better meet the animal's age-related requirements; 3) formulating diets to include the minimal amounts of nutrients re- quired to satisfy production goals; 4) meeting the ani- mal's amino acid requirements; 5) using synthetic amino acid supplements to feed to reduce N emission; 6) using feed ingredients with high digestibility and nutrient bioavailability; and 7) formulating diets based on nutrient availability instead of total nutrient con- tent.

We use an 85\u2010country partial equilibrium model and species\u2010area relationships to estimate extinction rates for 2,472 nationally endemic forest\u2010dependent amphibian, bird and mammal species if a REDD+ mechanism had been in place during 2005\u20132010.

Introduction Is an emissions trading program' an economic incentive program? Emissions trading programs allow polluters to avoid pollution reductions at a regulated pollution source, if they provide an equivalent reduction elsewhere.2 Most scholars, government officials, and practitioners equate emissions trading with economic incentives, but they do not define \"economic incentives.\" This failure to define economic incentives leaves unsupported the suggestion that emissions trading realizes environmental goals through economic incentives, but that traditional regulations (rules that limit discharges of pollutants into the environment without allowing trading) do not. Both traditional regulation and emissions trading rely upon the threat of a monetary penalty to secure compliance with government commands setting emission limitations.3 Perhaps neither traditional regulation nor emissions trading should be considered economic incentive programs, because both rely upon government commands.4 Or perhaps both should be considered economic incentive programs, because monetary penalties provide a crucial economic incentive in both systems. Rather than define economic incentives, scholars employ a conventional dichotomy that contrasts \"command and control\" regulations (rules that dictate precisely how a polluter must clean-up) with economic incentives.5 They claim that command and control regulations work inefficiently, discourage innovation, and fail to provide continuous incentives to reduce pollution, but that emissions trading and other economic incentive programs overcome these problems.6 The dichotomy between command and control regulations and economic incentives has had a powerful influence upon policy.7 On October 22, 1997, President Clinton outlined his plans to address global climate change, an increase in global mean surface temperatures that emissions of carbon dioxide and other \"greenhouse gases\" cause.8 The President's speech stressed the issue's importance by referring to some possible consequences of climate change including \"disruptive weather events\" (such as droughts and floods), the spread of \"disease bearing insects,\" and receding glaciers (which might cause inundation of coastal areas).9 President Clinton did not mention a single new traditional regulatory program or propose any specific cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, such as carbon dioxide, below 1990 levels to combat this potential menace. Instead, he announced a \"package of strong market incentives, tax cuts and cooperative efforts with industry.\"'o The President's package included emissions trading, which is the \"economic incentive program\" most often implemented. His proposal would allow polluters in one country to avoid greenhouse gas reductions at home in exchange for pollution reductions abroad.\" Not surprisingly, emissions trading became an important element of the subsequently negotiated Kyoto Protocol on climate change, in which the developed countries apparently agreed to modest cuts in greenhouse gas emissions.'2 A few days prior to Clinton's speech on climate change, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released its proposal to address interstate pollution, an important impediment to delivering healthful air under the 1990 Amendments to the Clean Air Act.'3 The EPA, predictably, called for an interstate emissions trading program.'4 This Article develops a theory of economic incentives. Any program to regulate or to deregulate creates economic incentives.'5 The programs referred to as \"economic incentive\" programs all envision a substantial governmental role of some kind. That is why lawyers, experts in law, write about them.'6 Moreover, traditional environmental law creates free markets. Law performs a fundamental role in creating markets generally,\" and environmental law is no different. For example, laws requiring businesses to keep promises to customers and suppliers (contract) make commercial transactions possible. \u2026", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "bc9c6d5d5aa000d927fccf13d8952e5fa66d4ad4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1493987666", "DOI": "10.4271/2003-01-0048", "CorpusId": 106622068}, "title": "NOx and PM Control from Heavy Duty Diesel Engines Using a Combination of Low Pressure EGR and Continuously Regenerating Diesel Particulate Filter", "abstract": "With growing concerns about NOx and particulate matter (PM) emissions from diesel engines, stricter regulations are being implemented which require advanced emission control technology.

Stationary sources are regulated and considerable effort is being put into developing low-pollution vehicles and environment-friendly transportation systems. While waiting for technological breakthroughs in emission controls, the current work assesses the exposure reductions achievable by a complementary means: efficient filtration of supply air in buildings. For this purpose infiltration factors for buildings of different ages are quantified using Exposures of Adult Urban Populations in Europe Study (EXPOLIS) measurements of indoor and outdoor concentrations in a population-based probability sample of residential and occupational buildings in Helsinki, Finland. These are entered as inputs into an evaluated simulation model to compare exposures in the current scenario with an alternative scenario, where the distribution of ambient PM2.5 infiltration factors in all residential and occupational buildings are assumed to be similar to the subset of existing occupational buildings using supply air filters. In the alternative scenario exposures to ambient PM2.5 were reduced by 27%. Compared with source controls, a significant additional benefit is that infiltration affects particles from all outdoor sources. The large fraction of time spent indoors makes the reduction larger than what probably can be achieved by local transport policies or other emission controls in the near future.\n\n\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS\nIt has been suggested that indoor concentrations of ambient particles and the associated health risks can be reduced by using mechanical ventilation systems with supply air filtering in buildings.

Based on the data of the carbon emissions of different industries in China, several simulations were made. The results indicate that the emissions trading policy can effectively reduce carbon emissions in a perfectly competitive market. Moreover, by comparing separate quota allocation mechanisms, we obtain the result that the scheme with a small extent quota decrease in a comprehensive allocation mechanism can minimize the unit carbon emission cost. Implementing this scheme can also achieve minimal effects of carbon emissions limitation on the economy on the basis that the environment is not destroyed. However, excessive quota decrease cannot promote the emitters to reduce emission.

We draw on norms theory and empirical studies to demonstrate how legal reforms can tie the widely held abstract norm of personal responsibility to the emerging concrete norm of carbon neutrality.

The scientific results from observations of low surface brightness objects and the diffuse background itself can be strongly affected by these background components and therefore great care should be taken in their consideration.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "72d4804309f643ff23b4f4c59bc531b766e048e1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1986599877", "DOI": "10.1039/C1JM11941A", "CorpusId": 94185904}, "title": "Flexible graphene/MnO2 composite papers for supercapacitor electrodes", "abstract": "Graphene/manganese dioxide (MnO2) composite papers (GMCP) are fabricated via a simple three-step route: preparation of graphene oxide/MnO2 composite (GOMC) dispersion, subsequent vacuum filtration of GOMC dispersion to achieve graphene oxide/MnO2 composite paper (GOMCP), and finally thermal reduction of GOMCP to generate GMCP. The morphology and microstructure of the prepared samples are characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy, thermal gravimetric analysis and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, as a binder-free and flexible electrode material for supercapacitors, the electrochemical properties of the prepared GMCP are evaluated by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge/discharge tests. As a result, the specific capacitance of the GMCP with the MnO2 weight ratio of 24% (GMCP-24) reaches 256 F g\u22121 at a current density of 500 mA g\u22121 and also shows good cycle stability, indicating a promising potential application as an effective electrode material for supercapacitors.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "4a90efbc701696d0abe62532c468286fb35e4edb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2124311045", "DOI": "10.1006/JEMA.2001.0467", "CorpusId": 30930810, "PubMed": "11721595"}, "title": "Rising to the Kyoto challenge: is the response of Canadian industry adequate?", "abstract": "A major weapon in Canada's CO2-emissions reduction arsenal is reliance on moral suasion and voluntary action. In this regard, the Voluntary Challenge and Registry (VCR) program constitutes a major effort to encourage industrial firms to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we begin by providing a critical review of Canadian climate change policy and Canada's international commitments. We then investigate the effectiveness of Canadian policies by analyzing a survey of industrial firms, examining factors that determine firms' familiarity with, participation in and commitment to the VCR program, and their stated potential to reduce emissions by 2008-2012 (Kyoto's commitment period). Results indicate that voluntary programs are unlikely to make a significant contribution to emissions reduction, with industrial firms indicating that, on average, they plan to reduce emissions by some 1-2% below their 1990 level under the current policy approach, much lower than Canada's 6% reduction target.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "2f61a5c66466eccae1f7f94d97d65ec1acac0f77", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1971276267", "DOI": "10.1161/01.STR.25.3.601", "CorpusId": 10001164, "PubMed": "8128513"}, "title": "Reduction of Functional Neuronal Connectivity in Long\u2010term Treated Hypertension", "abstract": "Background and Purpose Anatomic imaging of patients with chronic well-treated hypertension has demonstrated dila- tation of the lateral cerebral ventricles and left brain atrophy, whereas positron emission tomography has shown only subtle reductions in regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in some subcortical nuclei. To further explore the implications of the imaging changes, an analytic technique designed to deter- mine functional neuronal connectivity between regions of interest (ROIs) was applied to the data on regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose to determine if and where in the brain reduction of functional neuronal connectivity occurred. Methods Glucose metabolism was measured by positron emission tomography in 17 older men (age, 68\u00b18 years) with well-controlled, noncomplicated hypertension of at least 10 years' duration and in 25 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. A significant correlation difference analysis was per- formed to determine which ROI pairs had reduced correlation coefficients (reduced functional neuronal connectivity). The vascular pattern of the reduction was determined after allo- cating the ROIs to their appropriate vascular territories. Results Compared with the control subjects, hypertensive patients had reduced correlation coefficients in cortical terri- tories of the internal carotid arteries but not of the vertebrobasilar arteries. The border zone supplied by the middle and anterior cerebral arteries was most affected. Conclusions The border zone between the anterior and middle cerebral arteries is vulnerable to ischemia from carotid pathology, systemic hypotension, or both. We hypothesize that although these hypertensive patients were \u201cwell controlled\u201d and had normal neuropsychological tests, they may have experienced ischemia severe enough to cause border zone reduction of functional neuronal connectivity as a result of carotid pathology, antihypertensive medications, hypotensive episodes with a right-shifted autoregulation curve, or other factors in isolation or combination.", "year": 1994}, {"paperId": "a5f0dd3dddd64ff749b2e182ad4ad4ea1e9b9400", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "6482018", "MAG": "2966864432", "DOI": "10.1126/sciadv.aav4707", "CorpusId": 133607576, "PubMed": "31032411"}, "title": "Clean air for some: Unintended spillover effects of regional air pollution policies", "abstract": "Improving air quality can come at the cost of increasing emissions and environmental deterioration elsewhere. China has enacted a number of ambitious pollution control policies to mitigate air pollution in urban areas. Unintended side effects of these policies to other environmental policy arenas and regions have largely been ignored. To bridge this gap, we use a multiregional input-output model in combination with an atmospheric chemical transport model to simulate clean air policy scenarios and evaluate their environmental impacts on primary PM2.5 and secondary precursor emissions, as well as CO2 emissions and water consumption, in the target region and spillover effects to other regions. Our results show that the reduction in primary PM2.5 and secondary precursor emissions in the target regions comes at the cost of increasing emissions especially in neighboring provinces. Similarly, co-benefits of lower CO2 emissions and reduced water consumption in the target region are achieved at the expense of higher impacts elsewhere, through outsourcing production to less developed regions in China.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "93064ddf7b2a9dcf0d3baed29050aaed80e236bb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "567330040", "CorpusId": 107762287}, "title": "Electronic Noise and Interfering Signals: Principles and Applications", "abstract": "Intrinsic Noise.- Fundamental Concepts.- Physical Noise Sources.- Noise Parameters.- Noise Analysis of Linear Circuits.- Frequency Domain Noise Analysis of Linear Multiports.- Noise Models of Electronic Devices.- Interfering Signals.- External Noise.- Interference Reduction Methods.- Methods of Reducing Emission of Interfering Signals.- Interconnection Modeling and Crosstalk.- Methods of Increasing Immunity to Interfering Signals.- Case Studies.- Low-Noise Circuit Design.- Noise Performance Measurement.- Noise in Sensing Circuits.- Noise in Communication Systems.- Computer-Aided Noise Analysis.- Protection Against Interfering Signals.", "year": 2005}]}
