Methods: Using an electronic database (Medline), we reviewed imaging studies that have evaluated resting cerebral blood flow (CBF), resting glucose metabolism or amyloid deposition in groups of subjects suffering AD or HF compared with healthy controls. Results: Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) investigations have reported global CBF reductions in HF groups compared with controls. In one recent SPECT study using modern voxel-based methods for image analysis, regional CBF deficits in the pre-cuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus were detected in a sample of HF sufferers relative to controls. The regional distribution of functional deficits in the latter study was similar to that found in many positron emission tomography (PET) investigations of glucose metabolism at early AD stages, as well as in recent PET investigations of amyloid deposition in AD. Discussion: Imaging studies have rarely investigated whether there are localized functional brain deficits in association with HF. Recent regional CBF SPECT data provide preliminary anatomic support to a view that AD-like brain changes may develop in HF patients, possibly as a consequence of chronic CBF reductions. Additional studies of larger HF samples are needed to confirm this possibility, preferably using PET measures that have afforded greater sensitivity and specificity to identify brain functional abnormalities associated with the diagnosis of AD, such as indices of glucose metabolism and amyloid deposition.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "1d202dfc30db2ddefe4b1359fa6f83cf98406fec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2083515072", "DOI": "10.1080/10473289.1998.10463733", "CorpusId": 19728186, "PubMed": "28076196"}, "title": "Impacts of Lowered Urban Air Temperatures on Precursor Emission and Ozone Air Quality.", "abstract": "Meteorological, photochemical, building-energy, and power plant simulations were performed to assess the possible precursor emission and ozone air quality impacts of decreased air temperatures that could result from implementing the \"cool communities\" concept in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB). Two pathways are considered. In the direct pathway, a reduction in cooling energy use translates into reduced demand for generation capacity and, thus, reduced precursor emissions from electric utility power plants. In the indirect pathway, reduced air temperatures can slow the atmospheric production of ozone as well as precursor emission from anthropogenic and biogenic sources. The simulations suggest small impacts on emissions following implementation of cool communities in the SoCAB. In summer, for example, there can be reductions of up to 3% in NOx emissions from in-basin power plants. The photochemical simulations suggest that the air quality impacts of these direct emission reductions are small. However, the indirect atmospheric effects of cool communities can be significant. For example, ozone peak concentrations can decrease by up to 11% in summer and population-weighted exceedance exposure to ozone above the California and National Ambient Air Quality Standards can decrease by up to 11 and 17%, respectively.

It is, therefore, important to find ways to reduce the influence of variations in wind power generation on these plants without forsaking large amounts of wind power. Using a unit commitment model, this work investigates the possibility to reduce variations by means of a moderator, such as a storage unit or import/export capacity. The relation between the reduction in CO2-emissions and the power rating of the moderator is investigated, as well as the benefit of a moderator which handles weekly variations compared with a moderator which has to be balanced on a daily basis. It is found that a daily balanced moderator yields a decrease in emissions of about 2% at 20% wind power grid penetration. The reduction in emissions is mainly due to an avoidance of start-up and part load emissions and a moderator of modest power rating is sufficient to achieve most of this decrease. In the case of a weekly balanced moderator, emissions are reduced as the moderator power rating increases. At 40% wind power grid penetration, a weekly balanced moderator reduces emissions with up to 11%. The major part of this reduction is due to the avoidance of wind power curtailment. The simulated benefit (CO2-emissions and costs) from adding a general moderator is compared with emissions from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies and cost data of five available moderator technologies; transmission capacity, pumped hydro power, compressed air energy storage, flow batteries and sodium sulphur batteries.

Conservation agriculture (CA), based on minimum tillage, crop residue retention, and crop rotations, has been proposed as an alternative system combining benefits for the farmer with advantages for the society. This paper reviews the potential impact of CA on C sequestration by synthesizing the knowledge of carbon and nitrogen cycling in agriculture; summarizing the influence of tillage, residue management, and crop rotation on soil organic carbon stocks; and compiling the existing case study information. To evaluate the C sequestration capacity of farming practices, their influence on emissions from farming activities should be considered together with their influence on soil C stocks. The largest contribution of CA to reducing emissions from farming activities is made by the reduction of tillage operations. The soil C case study results are not conclusive. In 7 of the 78 cases withheld, the soil C stock was lower in zero compared to conventional tillage, in 40 cases it was higher, and in 31 of the cases there was no significant difference. The mechanisms that govern the balance between increased or no sequestration after conversion to zero tillage are not clear, although some factors that play a role can be distinguished, e.g., root development and rhizodeposits, baseline soil C content, bulk density and porosity, climate, landscape position, and erosion/deposition history. Altering crop rotation can influence soil C stocks by changing quantity and quality of organic matter input. More research is needed, especially in the tropical areas where good quantitative information is lacking. However, even if C sequestration is questionable in some areas and cropping systems, CA remains an important technology that improves soil processes, controls soil erosion and reduces production cost.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "712cc55d222fd61d5338cc97ee70746ea7185663", "externalIds": {"MAG": "82127257", "DOI": "10.1007/978-1-4471-4781-7_2", "CorpusId": 107440832}, "title": "Buildings and Climate Change", "abstract": "This chapter provides the global context for the need to reduce energy and GHG emissions associated with buildings.

This study uses an Integrated Transport and Health Impact Modelling tool (ITHIM) to evaluate the health and environmental impacts of high walking and cycling transport scenarios for English and Welsh urban areas outside London. Methods Three scenarios with increased walking and cycling and lower car use were generated based upon the Visions 2030 Walking and Cycling project. Changes to carbon dioxide emissions were estimated by environmental modelling. Health impact assessment modelling was used to estimate changes in Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) resulting from changes in exposure to air pollution, road traffic injury risk, and physical activity. We compare the findings of the model with results generated using the World Health Organization's Health Economic Assessment of Transport (HEAT) tools. Results This study found considerable reductions in disease burden under all three scenarios, with the largest health benefits attributed to reductions in ischemic heart disease. The pathways that produced the largest benefits were, in order, physical activity, road traffic injuries, and air pollution. The choice of dose response relationship for physical activity had a large impact on the size of the benefits. Modelling the impact on all-cause mortality rather than through individual diseases suggested larger benefits. Using the best available evidence we found fewer road traffic injuries for all scenarios compared with baseline but alternative assumptions suggested potential increases.

We monitored environmental and plant physiological responses to closed chambers during measurements of CH 4 emission from Typha latifolia (cattails) to evaluate potential errors in emission estimates. In 1990, two wetlands were studied: one in NE Kansas and one in central New York. Leaves and stems of Typha enclosed in gas-impermeable, collapsible bags were exposed to rapid increases in chamber air temperature and, thus, tissue temperatures (up to 9 \u00b0C above ambient) as well as rapid reductions in both CO 2 partial pressure due to photosynthesis and the leaf-to-air water vapor pressure deficit due to transpiration. These rapid (< 5 min) environmental changes within chambers are known to affect stomatal aperture through which CH 4 exits Typha leaves. Indeed, stomatal conductance ( g ) increased up to 42% compared to control leaves after 19 min of enclosure in chambers, and chamber effects on interactions between irradiance and g were detected. The duration of enclosure also critically affected the CH 4 gradient within chambers. Estimated CH 4 emission from leaves in chambers sampled after 19 min (3 nmol m -2 s -1 ) was 10-fold lower than estimates based on 30-s sampling periods (30 nmol m -2 s -1 ) due to reduction in the leaf-to-air concentration gradient for CH 4 . Since closed chambers (1) induce alterations in g, (2) may result in rapid environmental changes, and (3) lead to almost instantaneous reductions in the leaf-to-air concentration gradient for CH 4 diffusion, we suggest that only very short enclosure times should be used when measuring CH 4 emission from plants.

However, because existing studies generally draw their conclusions from simulations of episodes lasting days to a week, there is a need to evaluate the biogenic impact over a relatively long timescale. Moreover, the magnitude of synergistic interaction between anthropogenic and biogenic emissions should be carefully quantified, and this issue is not accounted for in most previous investigations. In this study, we performed a summer seasonal (June to August 1995) model evaluation of surface ozone across the continental United States. A three-dimensional regional climate, emissions, and air quality modeling system was used to do the simulations. The factor separation (FS) technique was applied to quantify the contributions from biogenic emissions alone and those from the synergy between anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. In the first step of this study, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Emission Trends (NET) 1996 and 2020 \u201ccontrol case\u201d raw anthropogenic emissions inventories were processed through Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE), an emissions model, to generate the speciated, gridded, and hourly emissions data needed for the air quality model. Next, six air quality simulations were carried out assuming zero emissions, biogenic only emissions, 1995 anthropogenic only emissions, biogenic plus 1995 anthropogenic emissions, 2020 anthropogenic only emissions, and biogenic plus 2020 anthropogenic emissions. The model results show that ground-level ozone concentrations decrease moderately under the EPA's 2020 emissions scenario for many areas within the continental United States, with large reductions in vast areas of the eastern United States. They also show that the 1995 summer average \u201ctotal biogenic contribution\u201d to daily maximum surface ozone concentrations can reach 34 ppb. Biogenic emissions are associated with at least 20% of surface ozone concentrations for the most areas of the continental United States, with the peaks reaching more than 40% in California coastal areas, the southeastern states, and northeastern areas. A sizable portion of this \u201ctotal biogenic contribution,\u201d however, (up to 80% in some areas) is due to the synergy between anthropogenic and biogenic emissions and would thus be influenced by controls on anthropogenic source emissions.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "8ea7e9225e1c4cbcde9d39b9dff3b10ee487c5c3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1992737780", "DOI": "10.1021/CM7022136", "CorpusId": 96146202}, "title": "New Ambipolar Organic Semiconductors. 2.

Various combinations of volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx ) emission reductions were effective in lowering modeled peak 1-hr ozone concentrations. However, VOC emissions reductions were found to have only a modest impact on modeled peak 8-hr ozone concentrations. NOx emission reductions generally lowered 8-hr ozone concentrations, but their effectiveness was partially or, in some cases, wholly offset by the increase in the number of NO cycles and, hence, in the ozone produced per NO. As a result, substantial NOx emission reductions\u201470 to 90%\u2014were required to reduce peak 8-hr ozone concentrations to the level of the standard throughout the modeling domain.

Three months later, ventricular function, regional myocardial perfusion, and FDG deposition (by excised tissue counting or positron emission tomography) were assessed in pigs after an over-night fast in the closed-chest anesthetized state. Total LAD occlusion with angiographic collaterals was present in the majority of animals. Left ventriculography showed severe anterior hypokinesis, and resting perfusion was significantly reduced in the hibernating LAD region in comparison with the normal remote regions (subendocardium: 0.80 +/- 0.06 versus 1.07 +/- 0.06 mL.min-1.g-1, P < .001; full-thickness: 0.87 +/- 0.04 versus 0.99 +/- 0.06 mL.min-1.g-1, P < .01). There was a twofold increase in full-thickness fasting FDG uptake in the dysfunctional LAD region (1.8 +/- 0.2 by positron emission tomography versus 1.9 +/- 0.1 by ex vivo counting). Ex vivo tissue counting revealed a pronounced transmural variation in FDG uptake in the hibernating region (LAD/normal), which averaged 2.5 +/- 0.2 in the subendocardium, 1.9 +/- 0.2 in the midmyocardium, and 1.4 +/- 0.1 in the subepicardium.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese results demonstrate that pigs instrumented with a proximal LAD stenosis develop hibernating myocardium characterized by relative reductions in resting function and perfusion in association with increased uptake of FDG in the fasting state. The transmural variations in relative resting flow and FDG uptake suggest that myocardial adaptations consistent with hibernation are most pronounced in the subendocardial layers and vary in relation to local coronary flow reserve.", "year": 1997}, {"paperId": "804ee7b899412f9b4e867edb909394cd14390dfb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2061276281", "DOI": "10.1143/JJAP.40.4715", "CorpusId": 121887072}, "title": "Emission Band Shift of the Cathodoluminescence of Y2SiO5:Ce Phosphor Affected by Its Activator Concentration", "abstract": "The high-temperature phase (X2-phase) and the low-temperature phase (X1 phase) of a potential low-voltage blue phosphor Y2SiO5:Ce have been studied.

Unfortunately, market data often are unavailable for this purpose. When this happens, WTP often is elicited from survey data. Of course, there are risks that consumers may not respond to a survey in the same manner that they respond in a real market. These risks can be reduced by framing the hypothetical context of the market as realistically as possible. In most prior applications, contingent valuation efforts have employed some variant of a direct WTP question. However, requesting survey respondents to supply a dollar value for what is probably an unfamiliar commodity inherently is problematic. In contrast, the contingent ranking procedure asks participants to compare and rank alternatives, each describing a different tradeoff between the provision of an environmental good and its price. The contingent ranking approach is employed in this paper to estimate the value of reduced exposure to diesel vehicle odors from a 1984 survey of 140 respondents in the Philadelphia area. Diesel vehicle odors are related physically to the broader mobile source particulate emissions problem. In diesel fuel combustion processes, odor-causing unburned hydrocarbons are attached to particulate byproducts. Since particle removal technologies contribute in varying degrees to odor reduction, policies to reduce mobile source particulate emissions will provide the additional benefit of reducing the diesel odor nuisance type of externality. Given the pervasive nature of the diesel odor problem, even values to avoid a single odor contact of a few cents can amount in the aggregate to many millions of dollars. Thus, the benefit of odor reduction could be comparable to the magnitude of other health and welfare benefits associated with control of mobile source particulate emissions.'", "year": 1989}, {"paperId": "cd2530c029b538a12d367a28a589aa53c86a0861", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2103751217", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/6/4/044004", "CorpusId": 56078498}, "title": "Space-based measurements of air quality during the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai", "abstract": "During the World Exposition 2010 (Expo, from May to October), emission control measures were implemented in Shanghai and surrounding areas to improve the air quality.

A review of enteric methane mitigation options 1", "abstract": "The goal of this review was to analyze published data related to mitigation of enteric methane (CH4) emissions from ruminant animals to document the most effective and sustainable strategies. Increasing forage digestibility and digestible forage intake was one of the major recommended CH4 mitigation practices. Although responses vary, CH4 emissions can be reduced when corn silage replaces grass silage in the diet. Feeding legume silages could also lower CH4 emissions compared to grass silage due to their lower fiber concentration. Dietary lipids can be effective in reducing CH4 emissions, but their applicability will depend on effects on feed intake, fiber digestibility, production, and milk composition. Inclusion of concentrate feeds in the diet of ruminants will likely decrease CH4 emission intensity (Ei; CH4 per unit animal product), particularly when inclusion is above 40% of dietary dry matter and rumen function is not impaired. Supplementation of diets containing medium to poor quality forages with small amounts of concentrate feed will typically decrease CH4 Ei. Nitrates show promise as CH4 mitigation agents, but more studies are needed to fully understand their impact on whole-farm greenhouse gas emissions, animal productivity, and animal health. Through their effect on feed efficiency and rumen stoichiometry, ionophores are likely to have a moderate CH4 mitigating effect in ruminants fed high-grain or mixed grain\u2013forage diets. Tannins may also reduce CH4 emissions although in some situations intake and milk production may be compromised. Some direct-fed microbials, such as yeast-based products, might have a moderate CH4\u2013mitigating effect through increasing animal productivity and feed efficiency, but the effect is likely to be inconsistent. Vaccines against rumen archaea may offer mitigation opportunities in the future although the extent of CH4 reduction is likely to be small and adaptation by ruminal microbes and persistence of the effect is unknown. Overall, improving forage quality and the overall efficiency of dietary nutrient use is an effective way of decreasing CH4 Ei.

A future climate change agreement would be more effective if it included all carbon losses and gains from land use in all countries and climate zones. The REDD mechanism will be an important step towards reducing emissions from land use change in developing countries, but needs to be followed by steps in other land use systems and regions. A national approach to REDD and significant coverage globally are needed to deal with the risk that deforestation and degradation activities are displaced rather than avoided. Favourable institutional and governance conditions need to be established that guarantee in the long-term a stable incentive and control system for maintaining forest carbon stocks.

Natural methane (CH4) emissions from wet ecosystems are an important part of today's global CH4 budget. Climate affects the exchange of CH4 between ecosystems and the atmosphere by influencing CH4 production, oxidation, and transport in the soil. The net CH4 exchange depends on ecosystem hydrology, soil and vegetation characteristics. Here, the LPJ-WHyMe global dynamical vegetation model is used to simulate global net CH4 emissions for different ecosystems: northern peatlands (45\u00b0\u201390\u00b0 N), naturally inundated wetlands (60\u00b0 S\u201345\u00b0 N), rice agriculture and wet mineral soils. Mineral soils are a potential CH4 sink, but can also be a source with the direction of the net exchange depending on soil moisture content. The geographical and seasonal distributions are evaluated against multi-dimensional atmospheric inversions for 2003\u20132005, using two independent four-dimensional variational assimilation systems. The atmospheric inversions are constrained by the atmospheric CH4 observations of the SCIAMACHY satellite instrument and global surface networks. Compared to LPJ-WHyMe the inversions result in a~significant reduction in the emissions from northern peatlands and suggest that LPJ-WHyMe maximum annual emissions peak about one month late. The inversions do not put strong constraints on the division of sources between inundated wetlands and wet mineral soils in the tropics. Based on the inversion results we diagnose model parameters in LPJ-WHyMe and simulate the surface exchange of CH4 over the period 1990\u20132008. Over the whole period we infer an increase of global ecosystem CH4 emissions of +1.11 Tg CH4 yr\u22121, not considering potential additional changes in wetland extent. The increase in simulated CH4 emissions is attributed to enhanced soil respiration resulting from the observed rise in land temperature and in atmospheric carbon dioxide that were used as input. The long-term decline of the atmospheric CH4 growth rate from 1990 to 2006 cannot be fully explained with the simulated ecosystem emissions. However, these emissions show an increasing trend of +3.62 Tg CH4 yr\u22121 over 2005\u20132008 which can partly explain the renewed increase in atmospheric CH4 concentration during recent years.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "dae36ec5a446df6b8da4c95c34a5c8b317157aea", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2038361696", "DOI": "10.1088/0029-5515/26/3/010", "CorpusId": 121618193}, "title": "Impurity reduction during ICRF heating in JFT-2M tokamak", "abstract": "Reduction of impurity line emissions associated with the ion cyclotron range of frequency (ICRF) heating is achieved by the phase control of a loop antenna array.

Multiple linear regression analysis was used on 11-year time series of all nitrogen dioxide (NO2) pixels from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over 18 NO2 hotspots in China. The regression analysis accounted for variations in meteorology, pixel resolution, seasonal effects, weekday variability and year-to-year variability. The NO2 trends suggested that there was an increase in NO2 columns in most areas from 2005 to around 2011 which was followed by a strong decrease continuing through 2015. The satellite results were in good agreement with the annual official NOx emission inventories which were available up until 2014. This shows the value of evaluating trends in emission inventories using satellite retrievals. It further shows that recent control strategies were effective in reducing emissions and that recent economic transformations in China may be having an effect on NO2 columns. Satellite information for 2015 suggest that emissions have continued to decrease since the latest inventories available and have surpassed the goals of the twelfth Five-Year Plan. Introduction China\u2019s rapid economic growth has been accompanied by an increase in emissions of air pollutants1, 2. In particular, the increases in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) can be clearly seen using satellite remote sensing3\u20135 although some regions, such as the River Delta, experienced reductions since 20056. Starting with the eleventh Five-Year Plan (FYP11, 2006-2010), policies were enacted to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide from coal-fired power plants even as coal consumption and emissions of nitrogen oxides continued to rise2, 7, 8. These reductions were clearly identified using satellite remote sensing9, 10. Inventories separated by activity sectors suggest that industrial sources and power generation account for close to three quarters of emissions and have the greatest potential for emissions reductions11. During the twelfth Five-Year Plan (FYP12, 2011-2015), China set a goal of reducing the annual national NOx emissions by 10% compared to the year 2010 (see http://news.xinhuanet.com/politics/2011-03/16/c 121193916.htm (in Chinese)). Scenario analysis suggests that NOx emissions could be reduced by 32% relative to business as usual by FYP11 and FYP1212. Further studies suggest reductions of emissions of 40% by the year 2020 relative to 201013, and a return to levels not seen since 1995 by 203014. To achieve the FYP12 goal, China has implemented a series of stringent measures and aggressive emission standards for coal-fired power plants (GB 13223-2011, July 2011), and heavy industries such as coking (GB 16171-2012, June 2012), iron and steel (GB 28662-2012, GB 28663-2012, GB 28664-2012, June 2012), cement (GB 4915-2013, December 2013), aluminum (GB 25465-2010, September 2010), lead and zinc (GB 25466-2010, September 2010), copper, nickel, and cobalt (GB 25467-2010, September 2010), etc.15. Among them, NOx emission-control measures on coal-fired power plants are the most effective ones. China had already shut down most coal-fired power units with capacity less than 50 MW by the end of 2003, and began to gradually close units with capacity less than 200 MW in 200716. Newly constructed units are required to be at least 300 MW and most of them have installed NOx emission control devices such as low NOx burners (LNB, 40-60% NOx removal rate) and selective catalytic/non-catalytic reduction systems (SCR/SNCR, 90% NOx removal rate). From 2011 to 2014, the installation rate of SCR/SNCR systems in coal-fired power units increased dramatically from 16.9% to 83.2% in terms of capacity17, 18. As a result, net NOx emission factor of the coal-fired power sector decreased sharply by 60% in only three years15. Moreover, China is continuously tightening its vehicle emission standards which are a major challenge for NOx emission control19. The China IV Emission Standard which is equivalent to Euro IV standard has been implemented since 2013; the China V Emission Standard which is equivalent to Euro V standard has been implemented in Beijing, Shanghai, and cities in Pearl River Delta, and will be enforced at the country level in 2017. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument has been widely used to estimate trends and emissions of NOx all over the world in the past decade20. Over China, in addition to the studies cited above, reconciled OMI and GOME-2 NO2 retrievals were used to estimate seasonal and weekday variations21. Recent work found rapid growth over western China continuing through 201315, 22 whereas reductions have been observed since 2011 in the main Chinese cities as well as in the North China Plain23, 24. Recently, we used a multiple linear regression model to study annual changes in NO2 columns over polluted areas while taking into account meteorology, pixel resolution, seasonality and day of week effects25. By using this method, we successfully identified the effects of the Great Recession in urban areas in the United States of America. In this work, we apply the method to China to evaluate the impact of the most recent Five-Year Plan. Our results confirm the announcement in November 2015 by China\u2019s Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) that China has achieved its national NOx emission reduction goal six months ahead of the FYP12 (http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2015-11/29/c 1117292909.htm (in Chinese)). Results & Discussion Annual averages of OMI columns over China show the high NO2 vertical columns over the megacities (Beijing, Yangtze Delta, Pearl River Delta) as well as industrial areas in the North China Plain (Fig. 1). Annually-averaged NO2 vertical columns reach values of up to 40\u00d71015 molec/cm2. Additional hotspots can be clearly seen for Xi\u2019an, Chengdu, Chongqing and Wuhan. The figure shows that most places experienced an increase from 2005 to 2011 followed by a decrease such that levels in 2015 are similar to 2005. In terms of net changes from 2005 to 2015, the most striking difference is the reduction in vertical columns over the Pearl River Delta, with peak annual averages decreasing from 35\u00d71015 molec/cm2 to 20\u00d71015 molec/cm2. While most of the other areas went through the increase to 2011 and decrease to 2015, the net change varies between positive and negative from site to site. There are lesser reductions visible in other cities and in the North China Plain. We performed a multiple linear regression for each of the areas circled in Fig. 1 and listed in Table 1. The individual time series of the OMI pixels and the regression are shown for each area in the supplementary information, along with the regression parameters. There are between 3,000 and 7,000 data points per area, and the correlation coefficients of the fit varies between 0.61 and 0.81. The annual variation of the official emission inventories for 2006 to 2014 are shown in Fig. 2 for the 9 sites that will be discussed below. The remaining 9 sites are shown in Fig. S1. The figures show both the total emissions and the split between industrial emissions (which includes both industry and power plants) and \u201cOther\u201d emissions which includes transportation and residential sources. For most areas there are gradual increases until about 2009 or 2010 and a sharp increase for 2011. This is then followed by a gradual decrease from 2012 to 2014. The right axis shows the corresponding percentage relative differences of the emissions for each year of the time period (i.e. the percentage that each year is above or below the 9-year mean). The percentage relative difference of the emission inventories can be compared directly with the percentage relative difference of the NO2 vertical columns based on the scaling factors obtained from the multiple linear regression model. The graph shows the uncertainty in the results as the range from 100 realizations of the model with bootstrapping. The average range by site varies between 12 and 23% over the 11-year time period. The average standard deviation of the trends varies between 2.5 and 4.4%, which suggests that the results are robust with respect to data selection, instrumental errors and model errors. Figs. S2 and S3 show the comparison of the annual trends in the satellite columns by season. The regression model was run separately for April to October (Summer) and for November to March (Winter). There is very good agreement between the summer, winter, and annual trends which suggests that the results are robust with respect to NOx lifetimes and photochemical activity. The correlation coefficients between the emission inventories and the vertical columns are shown in Table 1 (see also Fig. S4). Overall, there is considerable agreement between the NO2 columns and the NOx emissions which provides supporting evidence for the increase in emissions up until 2011 followed by a strong decrease from 2011 to 2015. In particular, Xi\u2019an, Chongqing, Nanjing and Hangzhou have very good agreement (Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between 0.86 and 0.95) with similar trends between the official inventories and the satellite retrievals. The years of maximum vertical NO2 columns at each site are also shown in Table 1 and Fig. S4. The Pearl River Delta has mostly had a decreasing trend over the entire period of study. In comparison, most sites peaked around 2011, with Beijing and Tianjin peaking the year before. Shanghai has a relatively poor fit and should be treated with caution when interpreting the results, as discussed below. There are some notable discrepancies between the columns and the inventories that can be seen in Fig. 2. In Beijing, there is a relatively poor fit with emission inventories. This seems to be because of the spike in \u201cOther\u201d emissions in 2007. The official emissions seem to overestimate the decrease from 2006 to 2009, but correctly identify the jump in emissio", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "10c0ba7c673319e7ffef87aa7b36dc5a7c0e8d68", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2325339513", "DOI": "10.1021/es300739r", "CorpusId": 12595235, "PubMed": "22788711"}, "title": "Evaluation of the impacts of biodiesel and second generation biofuels on NO(x) emissions for CARB diesel fuels.", "abstract": "The impact of biodiesel and second generation biofuels on nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) emissions from heavy-duty engines was investigated using a California Air Resources Board (CARB) certified diesel fuel.

Wildfires pose a significant risk to human livelihoods and are a substantial health hazard due to emissions of toxic smoke. Previous studies have shown that climate change, increasing atmospheric CO2, and human demographic dynamics can lead to substantially altered wildfire risk in the future, with fire activity increasing in some regions and decreasing in others. The present study re-examines these results from the perspective of air pollution risk, focussing on emissions of airborne particulate matter (PM2.\u20095), combining an existing ensemble of simulations using a coupled fire\u2013dynamic vegetation model with current observation-based estimates of wildfire emissions and simulations with a chemical transport model. Currently, wildfire PM2.\u20095 emissions exceed those from anthropogenic sources in large parts of the world. We further analyse two extreme sets of future wildfire emissions in a socio-economic, demographic climate change context and compare them to anthropogenic emission scenarios reflecting current and ambitious air pollution legislation. In most regions of the world, ambitious reductions of anthropogenic air pollutant emissions have the potential to limit mean annual pollutant PM2.\u20095 levels to comply with World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines for PM2.\u20095. Worst-case future wildfire emissions are not likely to interfere with these annual goals, largely due to fire seasonality, as well as a tendency of wildfire sources to be situated in areas of intermediate population density, as opposed to anthropogenic sources that tend to be highest at the highest population densities. However, during the high-fire season, we find many regions where future PM2.\u20095 pollution levels can reach dangerous levels even for a scenario of aggressive reduction of anthropogenic emissions.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "2a7a0b9bd2128c673233c9ea2805d1d3a34f91ba", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2059440879", "DOI": "10.1039/C2RA20266B", "CorpusId": 98288220}, "title": "Structural refinement, growth process, photoluminescence and photocatalytic properties of (Ba1-xPr2x/3)WO4 crystals synthesized by the coprecipitation method", "abstract": "Barium praseodymium tungstate (Ba1-xPr2x/3)WO4 crystals with (x = 0, 0.01, and 0.02) were prepared by the coprecipitation method.

Overall, the countries party to the Protocol surpassed their aggregate commitment by an average 2.4 GtCO2e yr\u20131. Of the possible explanations for this overachievement, \u2018hot-air\u2019 was estimated at 2.2 GtCO2e yr\u20131, while accounting rules for land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) further removed 0.4 GtCO2e yr\u20131 from the net result excluding LULUCF. The hypothetical participation of the US and Canada would have reduced this overachievement by a net 1 GtCO2e yr\u20131. None of these factors \u2013 some of which may be deemed illegitimate \u2013 would therefore on its own have led to global non-compliance, even without use of the 0.3 GtCO2e of annual emissions reductions generated by the Clean Development Mechanism. The impact of domestic policies and \u2018carbon leakage\u2019 \u2013 neither of which is quantitatively assessed here \u2013 should not be neglected either. Policy relevance Given the ongoing evolution of the international climate regime and the adoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015, we believe that there is a need to evaluate the results of the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. To our knowledge there has been no overarching quantitative ex post assessment of the Kyoto Protocol based on the final emissions data for 2008\u20132012, which became available in late 2015. This article attempts to fill this gap, focusing on the domestic and international compliance of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in the first commitment period.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "0c9513b0a19870ebb106483965646863d3a950ed", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2149941310", "DOI": "10.1006/JAER.1996.0021", "CorpusId": 110134019}, "title": "Reduction of ammonia emission from a cow cubicle house by flushing with water or a formalin solution", "abstract": "Abstract Two methods to reduce the emission of ammonia from cow houses with a partially slatted floor were investigated.

The second method was similar to the first one, except that 4\u00a0g of formaldehyde per litre of flushing water was added (formalin treatment). The trial was conducted in two compartments of an experimental cubicle house. In one compartment the formalin treatment was applied for a period of 24\u00a0d, followed by the water treatment for 41\u00a0d. Simultaneously, the emission was recorded in a second compartment with no scraping or flushing.

The water treatment lowered the emission by 14% (95% confidence interval 9%\u201319%). The formalin treatment reduced emission by 50% (95% confidence interval 45%\u201355%).

Several studies have indicated that the degree of FDG uptake in primary lung cancer can be used as a prognostic indicator. Differential diagnosis of lung tumors has been studied extensively with both computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET). It has been established that FDG-PET is clinically very useful and that its diagnostic accuracy is higher than that of CT. Detection of lymph node or distant metastases in known cancer patients using a whole-body imaging technique with FDG-PET has become a good indication for PET. FDG uptake may be seen in a variety of tissues due to physiological glucose consumption. Also FDG uptake is not specific for cancer. Various types of active inflammation showed FDG uptake to a certain high level. Understanding of the physiological and benign causes of FDG uptake is important for accurate interpretation of FDG-PET.In monitoring radio/chemotherapy, changes in FDG uptake correlate with the number of viable cancer cells, whereas Met is a marker of proliferation. Reduction of FDG uptake is a sensitive marker of viable tissue, preceding necrotic extension and volumetric shrinkage. FDG-PET is useful for the detection of recurrence and for monitoring the therapeutic response of tumor tissues in various cancers, including those of the lung, colon, and head and neck.

Direct application of geothermal energy (for heating, bathing etc.) has been reported by 72 countries. By the end of 2004, the worldwide use of geothermal energy was 57 TWh/yr of electricity and 76 TWh/yr for direct use. Ten developing countries are among the top fifteen countries in geothermal electricity production. Six developing countries are among the top fifteen countries reporting direct use. China is at the top of the latter list. It is considered possible to increase the installed world geothermal electricity capacity from the current 10 GW to 70 GW with present technology, and to 140 GW with enhanced technology. Enhanced Geothermal Systems, which are still at the experimental level, have enormous potential for primary energy recovery using new heatexploitation technology to extract and utilise the Earth\u2019s stored thermal energy. Present investment cost in geothermal power stations is 2-4.5 million euro/MWe, and the generation cost 40-100 euro/MWh. Direct use of geothermal energy for heating is also commercially competitive with conventional energy sources. Scenarios for future development show only a moderate increase in traditional direct use applications of geothermal resources, but an exponential increase is foreseen in the heat pump sector, as geothermal heat pumps can be used for heating and/or cooling in most parts of the world. CO2 emission from geothermal power plants in high-temperature fields is about 120 g/kWh (weighted average of 85% of the world power plant capacity). Geothermal heat pumps driven by fossil fuelled electricity reduce the CO2 emission by at least 50% compared with fossil fuel fired boilers. If the electricity that drives the geothermal heat pump is produced from a renewable energy source like hydropower or geothermal energy the emission savings are up to 100%. The total CO2 emission reduction potential of geothermal heat pumps has been estimated to be 1.2 billion tonnes per year or about 6% of the global emission. The CO2 emission from low-temperature geothermal water is negligible or in the order of 0-1 g CO2/kWh depending on the carbonate content of the water. Geothermal energy is available day and night every day of the year and can thus serve as a supplement to energy sources which are only available intermittently. Renewable energy sources can contribute significantly more to the mitigation of climate change by cooperating than by competing. Likely case scenarios are presented in the paper for electricity production and direct use of geothermal energy, as well as the mitigation potential of geothermal resources 2005-2050.

The soil sequestration components of recent estimates of the carbon mitigation potential of UK agricultural land were calculated on the basis of a percentage change to the soil carbon stock present in the soil. Recent data suggest that the carbon stock of soil in UK arable land has been overestimated, meaning that potential soil carbon sequestration rates were also overestimated. Here, we present a new estimate of the carbon stock in UK arable land, and present revised estimates for the carbon mitigation potential of UK agricultural land. The stock of soil organic carbon in UK arable land (0\u201330\u2003cm) is estimated to be 562\u2003Tg, about half of the previous estimate. Consequently, the soil carbon sequestration component of each mitigation option is reduced by about half of previously published values. Since above\u2010ground carbon accumulation and fossil fuel carbon savings remain unchanged by these new soil carbon data, options with a significant non\u2010soil carbon mitigation component are reduced by less than those resulting from soil carbon sequestration alone. The best single mitigation option (bioenergy crop production on surplus arable land) accounts for 3.5\u2003Tg\u2003C\u2003yr\u22121, (2.2% of the UK's 1990 CO2\u2010carbon emissions), whilst an optimal combined land\u2010use mitigation option accounts for 6.1\u2003Tg\u2003C\u2003yr\u22121 (3.9% of the UK's 1990 CO2\u2010carbon emissions). These revised figures suggest that through manipulation of arable land, the UK could, at best, meet 49% of its contribution to the EU's overall Kyoto CO2\u2010carbon emission reduction target (8% of 1990 emissions), and 31% of the greater target accepted by the UK (12.5%).

Current price-cost margins for major reserves are ample, leaving scope for significant price reductions if climate policies reduce demand for fossil fuels through conservation or substitution to clean alternatives. Most models simulating the consequences of climate policies completely disregard these supply responses. As for theoretical models, under standard assumptions they predict such strong supplier responses that climate policies may have no effect on cumulative emissions and may even leave society worse off, suffering damages from global warming sooner and with less time to adapt (the \u201cgreen paradox\u201d).We contribute to this literature by developing a richer theoretical model that takes account of the different extraction costs and emissons rates of different fossil reserves. We use this model to compare the qualitative effects of four policy options\u2014accelerating cost reductions in the clean backstop technologies, taxing emissions, improving energy efficiency, and a clean fuel blend mandate. We also discuss the consequences of mandating carbon capture and sequestration. All policies can reduce cumulative emissions, but the backstop policy accelerates emissions while conservation policies (energy efficiency or blend mandates) delay emissions. We then calibrate the model using data on costs, reserves, and emissions factors for five major categories of oil. Using this calibrated model, we estimate the interemporal leakage rate\u2014the percentage error in cumulative emissions reductions that would arise if no account is taken of the supply responses of oil producers.

Seasonal variability was large for CO with a winter to summer reduction of 69\u202f%, and monthly fluxes were strongly anti-correlated with mean air temperature. The winter increment in CO emissions was attributed mainly to vehicle cold starts and reduced fuel combustion efficiency. CO2 fluxes were 33\u202f% higher in winter than in summer and anti-correlated with mean air temperature, albeit to a lesser extent than for CO. This was attributed to an increased demand for natural gas for heating during the winter. CH4 fluxes exhibited moderate seasonality (21\u202f% larger in winter), and a spatially variable linear anti-correlation with air temperature. Differences in resident population within the flux footprint explained up to 90\u202f% of the spatial variability of the annual CO2 fluxes and up to 99\u202f% for CH4.

However, the extent to which businesses embrace climate change and carbon management as an integral pillar of their business models remains unclear and poorly understood. This paper seeks to address these issues.Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The aim of this research is to investigate the key carbon emissions reduction initiatives currently being implemented in the UK industrial sectors so as to improve their competitiveness. In order to achieve this aim, a mixed research methodological approach was adopted to collect and analyse data.

One approach is to increase the metallic Fe input to the production system. A common belief is that scrap works as a CO 2 diluent when introduced in iron ore based steelmaking. It is not necessarily so. Scrap is a key supplementary charge material in oxygen steelmaking converters, but scrap can also be utilised in ironmaking where it will decrease the use of'reducing agents and with that also the specific CO 2 emissions. By the use of a process integration model which basically includes the primary processes of cokemaking, sintering, ironmaking and oxygen steelmaking the overall influence of scrap input on CO 2 emissions is demonstrated and commented. The influence of hot metal silicon content is elucidated by calculations with different material and process constraints. The results show that at moderate scrap rates, the reduction of CO 2 emissions is favoured by increased scrap additions to the oxygen converter. When the scrap additions to the converter balances the actual heat capacity of the bath, other means to achieve an increased scrap melting capacity can be taken into account. This include combinations of scrap addition to the blast furnace, increased silicon content in tapped hot metal, and/or addition of Ferro-silicon combined with further scrap additions to the oxygen converter. Different strategies for CO 2 emission reduction have to be suggested depending on if the objective is to minimise the site (direct) emissions or the global (indirect+direct) emissions.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "c9f23b4c18935b1091ae16677290a3f23c9ac148", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 201047502}, "title": "Selective Catalytic Reduction of NO x", "abstract": "The recent diesel scandal made the public aware of the fact that NOx emissions from combustion processes are a major threat to human health and by no means easy to avoid. The most efficient process to reduce NOx emissions from lean exhaust gases is selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with ammonia, which has undergone tremendous development over the past few decades. Originally only applied in stationary power plants and industrial installations, SCR systems are now installed also in millions of mobile diesel engines, ranging from off-road machineries, heavy-duty and light-duty trucks, and passenger cars, to locomotives and ships. All these applications involve specific challenges due to tighter emission limits, new internal combustion engine technologies, or alternative fuels. The review articles and original research papers in this edited book contribute to the solution of these challenges with a broad range of innovative ideas, covering many aspects of SCR technology. One of the bottlenecks of the application of SCR technology in vehicles, and particularly passenger cars, is the threshold temperature of about 200 \u25e6C for injection of the urea solution in hot exhaust gas, which is above the exhaust gas temperature for some modes of engine operation. Sala, Bielaczyc, and Brzezanski have addressed this problem by preheating and evaporation of the urea solution before injection into the engine\u2019s exhaust gas [1]. The concept was checked at a diesel test rig and significantly improved NOx reduction efficiencies were observed. A critical factor for the efficiency of SCR systems is the uniformity of the reducing agent distribution across the frontal area of the catalytic converter. To this end, Sala et al. have developed an automated sampling and analysis system to probe the NOx and NH3 concentration profiles of a passenger car SCR catalytic converter indirectly from the downstream side of the converter [2]. Regarding stationary SCR applications, firing of biomass is a special challenge due to the high concentration of impurities and particularly potassium contained in this type of fuel, deactivating the used vanadia\u2013titania-based catalysts. Schill and Fehrmann reviewed different strategies for SCR systems to cope with the high potassium loading from biomass with a focus on intrinsically potassium-resistant SCR catalysts [3]. Such catalysts can be prepared by coating vanadia\u2013titania systems with thin protective layers of, for example, magnesia or sepiolite, using zeolites as support, replacing tungsta with heteropoly acids, and preparation methods to achieve unusual high surface areas. Zhao, Mao, and Dong have worked on ways to improve vanadia\u2013titania systems and achieved good low-temperature activity combined with water and sulfur tolerance, when adding manganesia and ceria [4]. The low-temperature SCR activity of this catalyst type can also be enhanced by promotion with heteropolyacids of the Keggin structure, as shown by Wu et al. in their study [5]. Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (DRIFTS) revealed that addition of the heteropolyacids increased the number of Br\u00f8nsted and Lewis acid sites, in addition to other beneficial effects. Selectivity to nitrogen is another important property of SCR catalysts. Kim and Young added iron oxide to a vanadia\u2013titania system and observed suppression of N2O formation at high temperatures, which was assigned to the formation of strong V\u2013O\u2013Fe interactions and tetrahedrally coordinated polymeric vanadates [6].", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "5fb9e390f0c5f5810b8b3dcb3f3125ccc4a37e15", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2094988040", "DOI": "10.1021/es1028487", "CorpusId": 36398721, "PubMed": "21128661"}, "title": "Carbon and sulfur cycling by microbial communities in a gypsum-treated oil sands tailings pond.", "abstract": "Oil sands tailings ponds receive and store the solid and liquid waste from bitumen extraction and are managed to promote solids densification and water recycling. The ponds are highly stratified due to increasing solids content as a function of depth but can be impacted by tailings addition and removal and by convection due to microbial gas production. We characterized the microbial communities in relation to microbial activities as a function of depth in an active tailings pond routinely treated with gypsum (CaSO(4)\u00b72H(2)O) to accelerate densification. Pyrosequencing of 16S rDNA gene sequences indicated that the aerobic surface layer, where the highest level of sulfate (6 mM) but no sulfide was detected, had a very different community profile than the rest of the pond. Deeper anaerobic layers were dominated by syntrophs (Pelotomaculum, Syntrophus, and Smithella spp.), sulfate- and sulfur-reducing bacteria (SRB, Desulfocapsa and Desulfurivibrio spp.), acetate- and H(2)-using methanogens, and a variety of other anaerobes that have been implicated in hydrocarbon utilization or iron and sulfur cycling. The SRB were most abundant from 10 to 14 mbs, bracketing the zone where the sulfate reduction rate was highest. Similarly, the most abundant methanogens and syntrophs identified as a function of depth closely mirrored the fluctuating methanogenesis rates. Methanogenesis was inhibited in laboratory incubations by nearly 50% when sulfate was supplied at pond-level concentrations suggesting that in situ sulfate reduction can substantially minimize methane emissions. Based on our data, we hypothesize that the emission of sulfide due to SRB activity in the gypsum treated pond is also limited due to its high solubility and oxidation in surface waters.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "bd3bbb4e36a7b7169e752a345913dba1bedf0da3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1488131042", "DOI": "10.3386/W13176", "CorpusId": 221151725}, "title": "Assessment of U.S. Cap-and-Trade Proposals", "abstract": "The MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis model is applied to synthetic policies that match key attributes of a set of cap-and-trade proposals being considered by the U.S. Congress in spring 2007. The bills fall into two groups: one specifies emissions reductions of 50% to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050; the other establishes a tightening target for emissions intensity and stipulates a time-path for a \"safety valve\" limit on the emission price that approximately stabilizes U.S. emissions at the 2008 level. Initial period prices are estimated between $7 and $50 per ton CO2-e with these prices rising by a factor of four by 2050. Welfare costs vary from near zero to less than 0.5% at the start, rising in the most stringent case to near 2% in 2050.

In this study, we investigated branch-level Hg0 atmosphere-foliage exchange in a pristine evergreen forest by systematically combining Hg isotopic composition, air concentration and flux measurements to unravel process information. It is found that the foliage represents a diurnally changing sink for atmospheric Hg0 and its Hg content increases with leaf age and mass. Atmospheric Hg0 is the dominant source of foliar Hg and the involvement of HgII is not supported by isotopic evidence. Upon Hg0 uptake, maturing foliage becomes progressively enriched in lighter Hg isotopes and depleted in odd mass isotopes. The measured isotopic composition of foliage Hg and isotopic shift caused by Hg0 evasion from foliage supports that Hg0 emitted from foliage is derived from Hg previously metabolized and bound in the leaf interior then subsequently recycled after reduction, and not merely a retroflux of recently deposited Hg0 on foliar surface. An isotopic differential mass balance model indicates that the proportion of foliar Hg0 efflux to uptake gradually increase from emergence to senescence with an average flux ratio of 30%.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "e7bad01170739d984b209213640bbf61f46114b0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2810691740", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-018-2226-y", "CorpusId": 158691408}, "title": "Global energy sector emission reductions and bioenergy use: overview of the bioenergy demand phase of the EMF-33 model comparison", "abstract": "We present an overview of results from 11 integrated assessment models (IAMs) that participated in the 33rd study of the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum (EMF-33) on the viability of large-scale deployment of bioenergy for achieving long-run climate goals. The study explores future bioenergy use across models under harmonized scenarios for future climate policies, availability of bioenergy technologies, and constraints on biomass supply. This paper provides a more transparent description of IAMs that span a broad range of assumptions regarding model structures, energy sectors, and bioenergy conversion chains. Without emission constraints, we find vastly different CO2 emission and bioenergy deployment patterns across models due to differences in competition with fossil fuels, the possibility to produce large-scale bio-liquids, and the flexibility of energy systems. Imposing increasingly stringent carbon budgets mostly increases bioenergy use. A diverse set of available bioenergy technology portfolios provides flexibility to allocate bioenergy to supply different final energy as well as remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by combining bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS). Sector and regional bioenergy allocation varies dramatically across models mainly due to bioenergy technology availability and costs, final energy patterns, and availability of alternative decarbonization options. Although much bioenergy is used in combination with CCS, BECCS is not necessarily the driver of bioenergy use. We find that the flexibility to use biomass feedstocks in different energy sub-sectors makes large-scale bioenergy deployment a robust strategy in mitigation scenarios that is surprisingly insensitive with respect to reduced technology availability. However, the achievability of stringent carbon budgets and associated carbon prices is sensitive. Constraints on biomass feedstock supply increase the carbon price less significantly than excluding BECCS because carbon removals are still realized and valued. Incremental sensitivity tests find that delayed readiness of bioenergy technologies until 2050 is more important than potentially higher investment costs.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "074fa037f0f8a9d810d8f9239f723bbe321aa779", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2031663438", "DOI": "10.1080/135116100111658", "CorpusId": 144784763}, "title": "Backcasting as a Tool to Develop a Sustainable Transport Scenario Assuming Emission Reductions of 80-90%", "abstract": "This article will summarise the results of The Netherlands pilot study commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment, and carried out by the Dutch National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM).

In this work we demonstrate the proof of principle of segmented magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided attenuation and scatter corrections in three-dimensional (3D) brain PET. We have developed a method for attenuation correction based on registered T1-weighted MRI, eliminating the need of an additional transmission (TX) scan. The MR images were realigned to preliminary reconstructions of PET data using an automatic algorithm and then segmented by means of a fuzzy clustering technique which identifies tissues of significantly different density and composition. The voxels belonging to different regions were classified into air, skull, brain tissue and nasal sinuses. These voxels were then assigned theoretical tissue-dependent attenuation coefficients as reported in the ICRU 44 report followed by Gaussian smoothing and addition of a good statistics bed image. The MRI-derived attenuation map was then forward projected to generate attenuation correction factors (ACFs) to be used for correcting the emission (EM) data. The method was evaluated and validated on 10 patient data where TX and MRI brain images were available. Qualitative and quantitative assessment of differences between TX-guided and segmented MRI-guided 3D reconstructions were performed by visual assessment and by estimating parameters of clinical interest. The results indicated a small but noticeable improvement in image quality as a consequence of the reduction of noise propagation from TX into EM data. Considering the difficulties associated with preinjection TX-based attenuation correction and the limitations of current calculated attenuation correction, MRI-based attenuation correction in 3D brain PET would likely be the method of choice for the foreseeable future as a second best approach in a busy nuclear medicine center and could be applied to other functional brain imaging modalities such as SPECT.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "579455c92d11899b173a7354f547c1badd3ed894", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1998966908", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-13-1689-2013", "CorpusId": 53967361}, "title": "A comprehensive emission inventory of biogenic volatile organic compounds in Europe: improved seasonality and land-cover", "abstract": "Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) emitted from vegetation are important for the formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in the atmosphere. Therefore, BVOC emission are an important input for air quality models. To model these emissions with high spatial resolution, the accuracy of the underlying vegetation inventory is crucial. We present a BVOC emission model that accommodates different vegetation inventories and uses satellite-based measurements of greenness instead of pre-defined vegetation periods. This approach to seasonality implicitly treats effects caused by water or nutrient availability, altitude and latitude on a plant stand. Additionally, we test the influence of proposed seasonal variability in enzyme activity on BVOC emissions. In its present setup, the emission model calculates hourly emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and the oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOC) methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone and acetic acid. In this study, emissions based on three different vegetation inventories are compared with each other and diurnal and seasonal variations in Europe are investigated for the year 2006. Two of these vegetation inventories require information on tree-cover as an input. We compare three different land-cover inventories (USGS GLCC, GLC2000 and Globcover 2.2) with respect to tree-cover. The often-used USGS GLCC land-cover inventory leads to a severe reduction of BVOC emissions due to a potential miss-attribution of broad-leaved trees and reduced tree-cover compared to the two other land-cover inventories. To account for uncertainties in the land-cover classification, we introduce land-cover correction factors for each relevant land-use category to adjust the tree-cover. The results are very sensitive to these factors within the plausible range. For June 2006, total monthly BVOC emissions decreased up to \u221227% with minimal and increased up to +71% with maximal factors, while in January 2006, the changes in monthly BVOC emissions were \u221254 and +56% with minimal and maximal factors, respectively. The new seasonality approach leads to a reduction in the annual emissions compared with non-adjusted data. The strongest reduction occurs in OVOC (up to \u221232 %), the weakest in isoprene (as little as \u221219 %). If also enzyme seasonality is taken into account, however, isoprene reacts with the steepest decrease of annual emissions, which are reduced by \u221244% to \u221249 %, annual emissions of monoterpenes reduce between \u221230 and \u221235 %. The sensitivity of the model to changes in temperature depends on the climatic zone but not on the vegetation inventory. The sensitivity is higher for temperature increases of 3K (+31% to +64 %) than decreases by the same amount (\u221220 to \u221235 %). The climatic zones \u201cCold except summer\u201d and \u201carid\u201d are most sensitive to temperature changes in January for isoprene and monoterpenes, respectively, while in June, \u201cpolar\u201d is most sensitive to temperature for both isoprene and monoterpenes. Our model predicts the oxygenated volatile organic compounds to be the most abundant fraction of the annual European emissions (3571\u20135328 Gg yr\u22121), followed by monoterpenes (2964\u20134124 Gg yr\u22121), isoprene (1450\u20132650 Gg yr\u22121) and sesquiterpenes (150\u2013257 Gg yr\u22121). We find regions with high isoprene emissions (most notably the Iberian Peninsula), but overall, oxygenated VOC dominate with 43\u201345% (depending on the vegetation inventory) contribution to the total annual BVOC emissions in Europe. Isoprene contributes between 18\u201321 %, monoterpenes 33\u201336% and sesquiterpenes contribute 1\u20132 %.We compare the concentrations of biogenic species simulated by an air quality model with measurements of isoprene and monoterpenes in Hohenpeissenberg (Germany) for both summer and winter. The agreement between observed and modelled concentrations is better in summer than in winter. This can partly be explained with the difficulty to model weather conditions in winter accurately, but also with the increased anthropogenic influence on the concentrations of BVOC compounds in winter. Our results suggest that land-cover inventories used to derive tree-cover must be chosen with care. Also, uncertainties in the classification of land-cover pixels must be taken into account and remain high. This problem must be addressed together with the remote sensing community. Our new approach using a greenness index for addressing seasonality of vegetation can be implemented easily in existing models. The importance of OVOC for air quality should be more deeply addressed by future studies, especially in smog chambers. Also, the fate of BVOC from the dominant region of the Iberian Peninsula should be studied more in detail.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "fad33467bfac889ada34600a4b2d63d970b7b5b5", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3763/cpol.2007.0491", "CorpusId": 154661937}, "title": "Back-casting analysis for 70% emission reduction in Japan by 2050", "abstract": "This article envisions a future in which advances in technology and urban development have transformed Japanese society by 2050, resulting in significant greenhouse gas reductions.

On the demand side, reductions of 40\u201345% are possible through efficiency improvements, decreased population and the more rational use of energy despite increased energy demands arising in certain sectors.
