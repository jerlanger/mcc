The reduction of NOx emissions by 50% during the summer results in lower average oxidant levels and lowers PM2.5 (8% on average), mainly because of reductions of sulfate (9\u201311%), nitrate (45\u201358%), and ammonium (7\u201311%). The organic particulate matter (PM) slightly decreases in rural areas, whereas it increases in cities by a few percent when NOx is reduced. Reduction of NOx during winter causes an increase of the oxidant levels and a rather complicated response of the PM components, leading to small net changes. Sulfate increases (8\u201317%), nitrate decreases (18\u2013 42%), organic PM slightly increases, and ammonium either increases or decreases a little. The reduction of VOC emissions during the summer causes on average a small increase of the oxidant levels and a marginal increase in PM2.5. This small net change is due to increases in the inorganic components and decreases of the organic ones. Reduction of VOC emissions during winter results in a decrease of the oxidant levels and a 5\u201310% reduction of PM2.5 because of reductions in nitrate (4\u201319%), ammonium (4\u201310%), organic PM (12\u201314%), and small reductions in sulfate.

The particulate samples were analysed using thermal analysis and Soxhlet extraction to determine the fraction of volatile and soluble organic material respectively. All three oxygenated compounds were found to be effective at reducing particulate emissions, with the maleate compounds being more effective overall than the diglyme. Analysis of the relative contributions of changes in the soot and soluble organic fraction (SOF) to the reduction of particulate matter indicated that, for diethyl maleate and diglyme, reductions in soot were the dominant effect. No consistent trends in NOx emissions were observed, although the diethyl maleate, which was most effective at reducing the particulate matter, increased the NOx slightly at most of the test conditions.

Linear programming was used to model diets with stepwise GHGE reductions, minimized departure from observed diet and three scenarios of nutritional constraints: none (FREE), on macronutrients (MACRO) and for all nutrient recommendations (ADEQ). Nutritional quality was assessed using the mean adequacy ratio (MAR) and solid energy density (SED). Setting France. Subjects Adults (n 1899). Results In FREE and MACRO scenarios, imposing up to 30 % GHGE reduction did not affect the MAR, SED and food group pattern of the observed diet, but required substitutions within food groups; higher GHGE reductions decreased diet cost, but also nutritional quality, even with constraints on macronutrients. Imposing all nutritional recommendations (ADEQ) increased the fruits and vegetables quantity, reduced SED and slightly increased diet cost without additional modifications induced by the GHGE constraint up to 30 % reduction; higher GHGE reductions decreased diet cost but required non-trivial dietary shifts from the observed diet.

These mandates have prompted the automotive industry to couple the development of combustion systems in modern diesel engines with an adequate reformulation of diesel fuels and have stirred interest in the development of clean diesel fuels. The use of oxygenated fuels seems to be a promising solution towards reducing particulate emissions in existing and future diesel motor vehicles. The prospective of minimizing particulate emissions with small fuel consumption penalties seems to be quite attractive in the case of biodiesel fuels, which are considered as an alternative power source. Studies conducted in diffusion flames and compression ignition engines have shown a reduction of soot with increasing oxygen percentage. However, the effects of the type of oxygenated additive and oxygen content on gaseous and particulate emissions obtained from modern DI diesel engines have not been fully investigated. An experimental investigation is conducted to determine the effect of oxygen content and oxygenate type on DI diesel engine performance and emissions. One conventional and three oxygenated fuels are examined having an oxygen content ranging from 0% to 9%. The fuels are prepared by blending a biodiesel compound (RME), Diglyme and Butyl-Diglyme with a low sulfur diesel fuel in various proportions. An experimental installation is prepared and engine tests are conducted on a naturally aspirated single-cylinder Ricardo Hydra research engine. The measurements are carried out at various operating conditions. The experimental findings reveal an increase of in-cylinder pressure due to the increase of cetane number. In addition, a slight increase of bsfc is observed due to the small decrease of fuel heating value with the increase of the oxygen content. A decrease of ignition delay is observed with increasing oxygen content following thus, the increase of cetane number. A considerable reduction of soot, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions is witnessed while; nitric monoxide emissions are increased when the oxygen content is increased from 3% to 9%. Similar effects are observed when replacing the rapeseed methyl ester with a mixture of diglyme and butyl-diglyme and the oxygen percentage remains unaltered. As revealed, a reduction of tailpipe soot without overall considerable penalties in bsfc and NO x emissions can be achieved in modem DI diesel engines using oxygenated additives at elevated percentages (30% by mass).", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "5043a3e9a6bf882f2409c4f466b4528aa35bc3a8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2129233080", "DOI": "10.1002/PAM.20610", "CorpusId": 154684289}, "title": "Policy attribute framing: A comparison between three policy instruments for personal emissions reduction", "abstract": "A comparative experiment in the UK examined people's willingness to change energy consumption behavior under three different policy framings: energy tax, carbon tax, and personal carbon allowances (PCA).

A new customized LCA tool is developed for the comparison of conventional gasoline and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs), which utilizes a dynamic vehicle simulation approach to calculate realistic, fundamental science based fuel economy data from actual drive cycles, vehicle specifications, road grade, engine performance, fuel cell degradation effects, and regenerative braking. The total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and life cycle cost of the vehicles are compared for the case of hydrogen production by electrolysis in British Columbia, Canada. A 72% reduction in total GHG emission is obtained for switching from gasoline vehicles to FCVs. While fuel cell performance degradation causes 7% and 3% increases in lifetime fuel consumption and GHG emission, respectively, regenerative braking improves the fuel economy by 23% and reduces the total GHG emission by 10%. The cost assessment results indicate that the current FCV technology is approximately $2,100 more costly than the equivalent gasoline vehicle based on the total lifetime cost including purchase and fuel cost. However, prospective enhancements in fuel cell durability could potentially reduce the FCV lifetime cost below that of gasoline vehicles. Overall, the present results indicate that fuel cell vehicles are becoming both technologically and economically viable compared with incumbent vehicles, and provide a realistic option for deep reductions in emissions from transportation.

An attempt has been made in this article to understand the contribution of ruminant livestock to climate change and to identify the mitigation strategies to reduce enteric methane emission in livestock. The GHG emissions from the agriculture sector account for about 25.5% of total global radiative forcing and over 60% of anthropogenic sources. Animal husbandry accounts for 18% of GHG emissions that cause global warming. Reducing the increase of GHG emissions from agriculture, especially livestock production should therefore be a top priority, because it could curb warming fairly rapidly. Among the GHGs, CH4 is considered to be the largest potential contributor to the global warming phenomenon. Ruminant livestock such as cattle, buffalo, sheep and goats contributes the major proportion of total agricultural emission of methane. Indian livestock system is a large contributor to GHGs and therefore also to the global warming phenomenon. Methane emission from enteric fermentation from Indian livestock ranged from 7.26 to 10.4 MT/year. In India more than 90% of the total methane emission from enteric fermentation is being contributed by the large ruminants (cattle and buffalo) and rest from s mall r uminants and others.

The development and application of a bottom-up carbon-counting approach called DECoRuM is described. DECoRuM is a Geographical Information System-based software model which estimates and maps baseline energy use and CO 2 emissions on a house-by-house level, identifies 'pollution' hotspots, predicts the potential for reductions in CO 2 emissions and monitors reductions achieved as a result of deploying energy efficiency measures and renewable energy systems. The application of DECoRuM model to a case study in Oxford shows that CO 2 emission reductions above 60% are possible, at a cost of between \u00a36 and \u00a377 per tonne of CO 2 emissions saved, depending upon the package of measures used and the scenario of capital costs (low or high) employed. Alongside DECoRuM, the author has led the development of an action-oriented Oxford Climate Change Action Plan (OCCAP) which uses top-down approaches to construct an accurate CO 2 emissions inventory for Oxford city for a baseline year, establish CO 2 reduction targets and propose action for each of the energy-related sectors to meet those targets. These two different, but complimentary, approaches provide a useful example for other cities in their endeavour for emission reductions. Copyright The Author 2009.

The sensitivity of calculated isoprene emissions to descriptors including leaf age, soil moisture, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and regional variability of emission factors is analyzed. The validity of the results is evaluated by comparison with compilations of published field\u2010based canopy\u2010scale observations. Calculated isoprene emissions reproduce above\u2010canopy flux measurements and the site\u2010to\u2010site variability across a wide range of latitudes, with the model explaining 60% of the variance. Although the model underestimates isoprene emissions, especially in northern latitude localities, this disagreement is significantly corrected when regional variability of emission factors for particular plant functional types is considered (r2 = 0.78). At the global scale, we estimate a terrestrial biosphere isoprene flux of 413 TgC yr\u22121 using the present\u2010day climate, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and vegetation distribution, and this compares with other published estimates from global modeling studies of 402 to 660 TgC yr\u22121. The validated model was used to calculate changes in isoprene emissions in response to atmospheric CO2 increase, climate change, and land use change during the 20th century (1901\u20132002). Changes in all of these factors are found to impact significantly on isoprene emissions over the course of the 20th century. Between 1901 and 2002, we estimate that at the global scale, climate change was responsible for a 7% increase in isoprene emissions, and rising atmospheric CO2 caused a 21% reduction. However, by the end of the 20th century (2002), anthropogenic cropland expansion has the largest impact reducing isoprene emissions by 15%. Overall, these factors combined to cause a 24% decrease in global isoprene emissions during the 20th century.

Integrated assessment models (IAMs) have quantified the sensitivity of low carbon pathways to a series of factors, including economic and population growth, national and international climate policies, and the availability of low carbon technologies, including negative emissions. In this paper we show how and to what extent emission pathways are also influenced by the discount rate. Using both an analytical and a numerical IAM, we demonstrate how discounting affects key mitigation indicators, such as the time when net global emissions reach zero, the amount of carbon budget overshoot, and the carbon price profile. To ensure inter-generational equity and be coherent with cost-benefit analysis normative choices, we suggest that IAMs should use lower discount rates than the ones currently adopted. For a 1000 GtCO2 carbon budget, reducing the discount rate from 5% to 2% would more than double today's carbon price (from 21 to 55 $/tCO2) and more than halve the carbon budget overshoot (from 46% to 16%), corresponding to a reduction of about 300 GtCO2 of net negative emissions over the century.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "19f5936bf4db08db76b2a715e879114a618af6f8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2000964881", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-005-6887-Y", "CorpusId": 154120728}, "title": "Future Sulfur Dioxide Emissions", "abstract": "The importance of sulfur dioxide emissions for climate change is now established, although substantial uncertainties remain.

This parameterization is then used to produce sulfur dioxide emissions trajectories for the set of scenarios developed for the Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES). We use the SRES methodology to produce harmonized SRES scenarios using the latest version of the MiniCAM model. The implications, and requirements, for integrated assessment modeling of sulfur dioxide emissions are discussed.

These emission reductions result from a combination of emission controls, the adoption of advanced electric technologies, and a shift away from the direct end use of coal with increasing income levels. Only under a scenario where incomes in developing regions increase slowly do global emission levels remain at close to present levels over the next century. Under a climate policy that limits emissions of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide emissions fall in a relatively narrow range.

The present paper assesses the environmental performance of marine fuels from well-to-propeller using life cycle assessment (LCA). Four fossil fuels are compared: heavy fuel oil (HFO), marine gas oil, gas-to-liquid (GTL) fuel, and liquefied natural gas (LNG), combined with two exhaust abatement techniques: open-loop scrubber and selective catalytic reduction.

In contrast, the use of LNG does not decrease the global warming potential by more than 8\u201320 per cent, the amount depending mainly on the magnitude of the methane slip from the gas engine. None of the fossil fuels scrutinized here would decrease the greenhouse gas emissions significantly from a life cycle perspective.

We review and quantify four different concepts, namely (1) a \u2018constant emission warming commitment\u2019, (2) a \u2018present forcing warming commitment\u2019, (3) a\u2018zero emission (geophysical) warming commitment\u2019 and (4) a \u2018feasible scenario warming commitment\u2019. While a \u2018feasible scenario warming commitment\u2019 is probably the most relevant one for policy making, it depends centrally on key assumptions as to the technical, economic and political feasibility of future greenhouse gas emission reductions. This issue is of direct policy relevance when one considers that the 2002 global mean temperatures were 0.8\u00b1 0.2 \u2218C above the pre-industrial (1861\u20131890) mean and the European Union has a stated goal of limiting warming to 2 \u2218C above the pre-industrial mean: What is the risk that we are committed to overshoot 2 \u2218C? Using a simple climate model (MAGICC) for probabilistic computations based on the conventional IPCC uncertainty range for climate sensitivity (1.5 to 4.5 \u2218C), we found that (1) a constant emission scenario is virtually certain to overshoot 2 \u2218C with a central estimate of 2.0 \u2218C by 2100 (4.2 \u2218C by 2400).

Increase in atmospheric emission of CO2 with the attendant global warming and environmental degradation are driven by global energy demand. In comparison with the emission of 300 Pg C between 1850 and 2000, total emission during the 21st century is estimated at 950 to 2195 Pg, with an annual rate of emission of 20 to 35 Pg C y\u22121. Reduction of CO2 atmospheric loading can be achieved by biological, chemical and technological options through either reducing or sequestering emissions. This article describes technological options of sequestering atmospheric CO2 into other global pools. Geologic sequestration involves underground storage of industrially emitted CO2 into the geosphere for long-term and secure storage. Liquefied CO2 is injected about 1000 m below the ground surface either in stable porous rocks, oil wells, coal beds, or saline aquifers. Co-injecting CO2 along with H2S and SO2 is also possible. Over time, the trapped CO2 reacts with minerals to form carbonates, enhances oil recovery, or displaces coal bed methane. Deep injection of CO2 under the ocean creates a CO2 lake which eventually penetrates into the sediments. Iron fertilization is another technique of enhancing the C pool in marine biota, notably phytoplankton. The so-called \u201cbiological pumping\u201d is based on the \u201ciron hypothesis\u201d of transferring C to the ocean floor. Terrestrial C sequestration is based on the natural process of photosynthesis. Transfer of CO2 into the biotic pool and soil C pool via humification and formation of secondary carbonates has numerous ancillary benefits through enhancement of ecosystem services. Soil C sequestration is essential to improving soil quality, increasing use efficiency of agronomic input, and advancing world food security. It is also needed to improve water quality by filtration and denaturing of pollutants, and enhancing biodiversity by saving land for nature conservancy.

We evaluated the global potential reduction of enteric CH4 emissions released from dairy cattle through amendment of their traditional diets in 183 countries aggregated to 11 regions. Amending dairy cattle diets involves increasing the concentration of lipid (up to 6\u00a0%) and decreasing the concentration of fiber, without affecting the total gross energy intake (GEI). Enteric CH4 emissions were calculated by using a mathematical model developed to include dietary intervention. In 2012, we found a global potential reduction of 15.7\u00a0% of enteric CH4 emissions from dairy cattle. The highest potential reduction per unit of milk produced occurs in Africa followed by South America and Asia (55, 46 and 34\u00a0%, respectively). The amended diets proposed here, mostly affect the regions in which demand for animal source protein will be greatest in the future. Because lipid supplementation may result in an indirect effect on CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from manure management, they were also estimated.

The discrete auroral arc that brightens at auroral substorm onset was found to be poleward of the diffuse aurora that contains the H emission by a distance of between 10 and 300 km. The average onset time was 2215 magnetic local time (MLT) and the average geographic latitude of the onset arc and the H arc was 64.6\u00b0 and 63.6\u00b0, respectively. The poleward crossover of the peak H emission occurs shortly after substorm onset, for substorm intensification after 2100 MLT. The peak H emission crosses back to the equatorward position during substorm recovery between 2100 and 0100 MLT. After 0100 MLT the peak H emission remains poleward of the electron-trapping boundary for the rest of the night. During the growth phase the peak H emission moves equatorward more quickly than does the onset arc and monotonically doubles in total intensity during the equatorward motion, in a manner quite unrelated to the fluctuations in brightness of the onset arc.

Increased atmospheric N deposition may have a significant impact on the emission of these greenhouse gases. We studied CO 2 and CH 4 emissions from untreated temperate peat soils from a eutrophic and a mesotrophic fen in a high N deposition area (the Netherlands) and from a mesotrophic fen in a low N deposition area (north-east Poland). In addition, we investigated the effects of N, P and glucose amendments on the emissions of CO 2 and CH 4 from these soils. Nitrogen availability (extractable NH 4 + ) in untreated peat from the high N area was 2.5-7.5 times higher than in the low N area, whereas the pH was 0.9-1.7 units lower. Using 6-week laboratory incubations of peat columns, we found that mean daily CO 2 emission from untreated peat soils from the high N area was lower than that from the low N area. Both linear and multiple regression analysis showed that CO 2 emission was positively related to soil pH (r 2 = 0.64). Additional N supply led to pH reduction and to lower CO 2 emission, especially in the low N peat soils. Thus, increased atmospheric N deposition leads, probably as a result of soil acidification, to lower CO 2 emission. Although glucose amendments resulted in increased CO, and CH 4 emission, we did not find evidence that this was caused by increased mineralization of native peat. Mean daily CH 4 -C emission was about 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than mean daily CO 2 -C emission. In the untreated peat soils from the high N eutrophic site, methane emission was higher than in the high N mesotrophic site and in the low N mesotrophic site. Linear regression analysis showed a positive relation between methane emission and soil fertility variables (r 2 =0.42-0.55), whereas a multiple regression model revealed that methane emission was determined by N-related soil chemistry variables (r 2 = 0.93). Increased nutrient supply initially resulted in higher methane emission from soils of both mesotrophic sites, but there was no effect on the high N eutrophic soil. These results show that increased atmospheric N deposition leads to increased methane emission from low-fertility peat soils. However, the ultimate effect of atmospheric N deposition on trace gas emissions and thereby on global warming is determined by the balance between the ratios of the change in CO 2 -C emission and CH 4 -C emission and the ratio of their global warming potentials (1:21).", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "af5d67c0960600644b31c130fd6be6a66af1756b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1977986663", "DOI": "10.1021/es901796k", "CorpusId": 33754465, "PubMed": "20073457"}, "title": "Effectiveness of a Florida landfill biocover for reduction of CH4 and NMHC emissions.", "abstract": "Methane-oxidizing \"biocovers\" were constructed at the Leon County Landfill (Florida).

The overall annual effectiveness/performance of the biocover was limited by seasonally high moisture contents and the thin gas distribution layer.

The distribution of waiting times between photoelectric counts is calculated, and its dependence on drivingfield intensity and detection efficiency is discussed. The photoelectron-counting distribution is derived from the waiting-time distribution. The relationship between photoelectron counting sequences and photon emission sequences is discussed and used to obtain an expression for the reduced state of the atom during the waiting times between photoelectric counts. The roles of irreversibility and the observer in atomic state reduction are delineated. The fluorescent photons emitted by a single coherently driven two-level atom exhibit the nonclassical property of photon antib~nchin~.l-~ The antibunching of fluorescent photons is seen in temporal correlations between photoelectric counts; the detection of one photon makes the detection of a second, after just a short delay, improbable. Photon antibunching is traditionally defined in terms of the degree of second-order temporal coherence g'2'( t, t +T). This is the joint probability for recording photoelectric counts in the intervals [t,t +At) and [t +T, t +7+At), normalized by the probability for two independent photoelectric counts. For antibunched light the joint probability for recording photoelectric counts closely spaced in time falls below the probability for statistically independent counts (separated by a time longer than the coherence time); thus, gi2'( t, t) < 1. The antibunching of fluorescent photons is also reflected in the sub-Poissonian character of the probability density p (n, t, t + TI for recording n photoelectric counts in the interval [r, t + T).~ p (n,t,t + T) can be derived from g'2'(t,t +T), although the detailed algebraic relationship is quite complicated. Both g'2'(t,t +T) and p (n, t, t + T) have been calculated for single-atom resonance fluorescence by a number of workers.'-lo Because of the complexity of general expressions in the time domain, some workers only give the Laplace transform for the photoelectron counting distribution, or give explicit time-dependent expressions only for limiting cases, such as short and long counting times. Recent theoretical work on \"quantum j~rn~s\"\"~~~ has drawn attention to the distribution of waiting times between photon emissions as another useful quantity for characterizing photon statistics-in terms of measured quantities, the distribution of waiting times between photoelectrons. By \"waiting time\" we mean the time T between a photoelectric count recorded at time t, and the next, recorded at time t +T. If photoelectron sequences can be described by a Markov birth process, a single conditional probability density w(~lt) specifies the distribution of waiting times between every pair of photoelectrons. We call this the photoelectron waiting-time distribution. Photoelectron waiting times for coherent light are exponentially distributed.I3 Antibunching implies that photons tend to be separated in time. The distribution of waiting times should then tend to peak around the average time between photoelectric counts.

The dominant influence on carbon emissions globally for next several decades will be growth more so than trade and its composition, and in turn, the size of trade seemingly matters more than its composition given differences in emission intensity between tradables and nontradables. We also note that differences in emissions intensity across countries are larger than across products or sectors and so issues of country discrimination in trade policy (and violations of MFN) arises. We next discuss both unilateral and regional carbon motivated trade policy arrangements, including three potential variants of carbon emission reduction based free trade area arrangements. One is regional trade agreements with varying types of trade preferences towards low carbon intensive products, low carbon new technologies and inputs to low carbon processes. A second is the use of joint border measures against third parties to counteract anti-competitive effects from groups of countries taking on deeper emission reduction commitments. A third is third country trade barriers along with free trade or other regional trade agreements as penalty mechanisms to pressure other countries to join emission reducing environmental agreements. We differentiate among the objectives, forms and possible impacts of each variant. We also speculate as to how the world trading system may evolve in the next few decades as trade policy potentially becomes increasingly dominated by environmental concerns.

It includes: 1) theoretical consideration on the effects; 2) processing techniques for semiconductor microcavities; and 3) some demonstrations of photonic crystal and microdisk cavity. It was shown that, even with a spectral broadening of electron transition, thresholdless lasing operation and alternation of spontaneous emission rate are expected in a cavity satisfying the single mode condition that only one mode is allowed in the transition spectrum. An ideal three-dimensional (3-D) photonic crystal has the potentiality for realizing this condition. In two-dimensional (2-D) crystals and microdisk cavities, thresholdless operation is also expected, but the alternation of spontaneous emission rate may be negligible due to the insufficient optical confinement. In the experiment, some processing techniques for GaInAsP-InP system were investigated and methane-based reactive ion beam etching was selected because of the smooth sidewalls and adaptability to arbitrary structures. A GaInAsP-InP 2-D photonic crystal constructed by submicron columns was fabricated using this method. Owing to the slow surface recombination of this material, a polarized photoluminescence and peculiar transmission spectra were observed at room temperature (RT), which can be explained by a photonic band calculation. However, some technical improvement is necessary for clear demonstration of photonic bandgap, which is minimally required for device applications. In contrast to this, a GaInAsP-InP microdisk cavity of 2 /spl mu/m in diameter, which corresponds to the cavity volume 2.5 times the single-mode condition, has achieved RT lasing with threshold current as low as 0.2 mA. Further reduction of diameter and realization of continuous-wave (CW) operation will provide a significant regime for the observation of spontaneous emission control effects.", "year": 1997}, {"paperId": "7829377f67c54adb33722ba912907d614509f31f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2550312573", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/11/11/114028", "CorpusId": 157094394}, "title": "Carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption of Beijing in 2012", "abstract": "The present study analyzed the consumption-based carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption of Beijing in 2012.

Some of these benefits are achieved by lengthening the growing season, which increases the period of crop water and nutrient uptake, pointing to a potential role for perennial systems to mitigate soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Employing a micrometeorological method, we tested this hypothesis in a 3\u2010year field experiment with a perennial grass\u2010legume mixture and an annual corn monoculture. Given that N2O emissions are strongly dependent on the method of fertilizer application, two manure application options commonly used by farmers for each crop were studied: injection vs. broadcast application for the perennial; fall vs. spring application for the annual. Across the 3 years, lower N2O emissions (P < 0.001) were measured for the perennial compared to the annual crop, even though annual N2O emissions increased tenfold for the perennial after ploughing. The percentage of N2O lost per unit of fertilizer applied was 3.7, 3.1 and 1.3 times higher for the annual for each consecutive year. Differences in soil organic matter due to the contrasting root systems of these crops are probably a major factor behind the N2O reduction. We found that a specific manure management practice can lead to increases or reductions in annual N2O emissions depending on environmental variables. The number of freeze\u2010thaw cycles during winter and the amount of rainfall after fertilization in spring were key factors. Therefore, general manure management recommendations should be avoided because interannual weather variability has the potential to determine if a specific practice is beneficial or detrimental. The lower N2O emissions of perennial crops deserve further research attention and must be considered in future land\u2010use decisions.

The effect of superficial liming of acidic forest soils on CO2 and N2O emissions and CH4 uptake was investigated with closed chambers in two deciduous and two spruce forests, by weekly to biweekly measurements over at least one year. The flux rates of untreated areas varied between 1.94 and 4.38 t CO2\u2010C/ha per y, 0.28 and 2.15 kg/N2O\u2010N/ha per y and between 0.15 and 1.06 kg CH4\u2010C/ha per y. Liming had no clear effect on CO2 emissions which may change in the long\u2010term with decreasing root turnover and increasing C\u2010mineralization. Apart from one exception, liming resulted in a reduction of N2O emissions by 9 to 62% and in an increase of CH4 uptake by 26 to 580%. The variability in N2O emissions between the forest sites could not be explained. In contrast, the variability of annual CH4 uptake rates could be explained by N content (r2= 0.82), C content (r2= 0.77), bulk density (r2= 60), pore space (r2= 0.59) and pH (r2= 0.40) of mineral soil at a depth of 0 to 10 cm, and by the quantity of material in the organic layer (r2= 0.66). Experiments with undisturbed columns of the same soils showed that between 1 and 73% of the total N2O emissions came from the organic layer. However, atmospheric CH4 was not oxidized in this layer, which represents a diffusion barrier for atmospheric CH4. When this barrier was removed, CH4 uptake by the mineral soil increased by 25 to 171%.

As a consequence, many cities introduced low emission zones (LEZs) to improve air quality and to meet the limit values. In Germany currently 48 LEZs are in operation. By means of dispersion modeling, PM10 concentrations were estimated to decrease up to 10%. Analysis of PM10 levels conducted for Cologne, Berlin, and Munich some time after the LEZs were introduced showed reduction of PM10 mass concentration in the estimated range. The PM10 particle fraction is, however, composed of particles with varying toxicity, of which diesel soot is highly health relevant. An evaluation of air quality data conducted in Berlin showed that in 2010 traffic-related soot concentrations measured along major roads decreased by 52% compared to 2007. Diesel particle emissions in Berlin were reduced in 2012 by 63% compared to a business-as-usual scenario (reference year 2007). A strong reduction of the traffic-related particle fraction of PM2.5 was also reported for Munich. Therefore, it is likely that the effects of LEZs are considerably more significant to human health than was anticipated when only considering the reduction of PM10 mass concentrations. Implications:\u00a0 The implementation of low emission zones in German cities might result in a reduction of PM10 levels concentrations by up to 10%. However, it is difficult to show a reduction of PM10 annual averages in this order of magnitude as meteorology has a large impact on the year-to-year variation of PM mass concentrations. Monitoring of other PM metrics such as black smoke (BS) or elemental carbon (EC) might be a better strategy for evaluating LEZs effects.

Measurements of airborne particles with aerodynamic diameter of 10 \u03bcm or less (PM 10 ) and meteorological observations are available from 13 stations distributed throughout Switzerland and representing different site types. The effect of all available meteorological variables on PM 10 concentrations was estimated using Generalized Additive Models. Data from each season were treated separately. The most important variables affecting PM 10 concentrations in winter, autumn and spring were wind gust, the precipitation rate of the previous day, the precipitation rate of the current day and the boundary layer depth. In summer, the most important variables were wind gust, Julian day and afternoon temperature. In addition, temperature was important in winter. A \"weekend effect\" was identified due to the selection of variable \"day of the week\" for some stations. Thursday contributes to an increase of 13% whereas Sunday contributes to a reduction of 12% of PM 10 concentrations compared to Monday on average over 9 stations for the yearly data. The estimated effects of meteorological variables were removed from the measured PM 10 values to obtain the PM 10 variability and trends due to other factors and processes, mainly PM 10 emissions and formation of secondary PM 10 due to trace gas emissions. After applying this process, the PM 10 variability was much lower, especially in winter where the ratio of adjusted over measured mean squared error was 0.27 on average over all considered sites. Moreover, PM 10 trends in winter were more negative after the adjustment for meteorology and they ranged between \u22121.25 \u03bcg m \u22123 yr \u22121 and 0.07 \u03bcg m \u22123 yr \u22121 .

In this connection, China provides a challenging case for a potential regional joint effort towards the CO2 reduction, because her emissions are shown to be the largest, both in the absolute term and in terms of average TEI.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "a489048fb86df37b9081b1debc0a8056d7966e36", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1915896780", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-15-13681-2015", "CorpusId": 2585533}, "title": "Aerosol composition, oxidation properties, and sources in Beijing: results from the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit study", "abstract": "Abstract. The mitigation of air pollution in megacities remains a great challenge because of the complex sources and formation mechanisms of aerosol particles. The 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Beijing serves as a unique experiment to study the impacts of emission controls on aerosol composition, size distributions, and oxidation properties. Herein, a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer was deployed in urban Beijing for real-time measurements of size-resolved non-refractory submicron aerosol (NR-PM1) species from 14 October to 12 November 2014, along with a range of collocated measurements. The average (\u00b1\u03c3) PM1 was 41.6 (\u00b138.9) \u03bcg m\u22123 during APEC, which was decreased by 53 % compared with that before APEC. The aerosol composition showed substantial changes owing to emission controls during APEC. Secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA: sulfate + nitrate + ammonium) showed significant reductions of 62\u201369 %, whereas organics presented much smaller decreases (35 %). The results from the positive matrix factorization of organic aerosol (OA) indicated that highly oxidized secondary organic aerosol (SOA) showed decreases similar to those of SIA during APEC. However, primary organic aerosol (POA) from cooking, traffic, and biomass-burning sources were comparable to those before APEC, indicating the presence of strong local source emissions. The oxidation properties showed corresponding changes in response to OA composition. The average oxygen-to-carbon level during APEC was 0.36 (\u00b10.10), which is lower than the 0.43 (\u00b10.13) measured before APEC, demonstrating a decrease in the OA oxidation degree. The changes in size distributions of primary and secondary species varied during APEC. SIA and SOA showed significant reductions in large accumulation modes with peak diameters shifting from ~ 650 to 400 nm during APEC, whereas those of POA remained relatively unchanged. The changes in aerosol composition, size distributions, and oxidation degrees during the aging processes were further illustrated in a case study of a severe haze episode. Our results elucidated a complex response of aerosol chemistry to emission controls, which has significant implications that emission controls over regional scales can substantially reduce secondary particulates. However, stricter emission controls for local source emissions are needed for further mitigating air pollution in the megacity of Beijing.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "dfdd0250f168fa4e90f80764b25991b9acec8b80", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/tmi/LipsinskiHKOM97", "MAG": "2183185170", "DOI": "10.1109/42.563658", "CorpusId": 24535687, "PubMed": "9101322"}, "title": "Expectation maximization reconstruction of positron emission tomography images using anatomical magnetic resonance information", "abstract": "Using statistical methods the reconstruction of positron emission tomography (PET) images can be improved by high-resolution anatomical information obtained from magnetic resonance (MR) images. The authors implemented two approaches that utilize MR data for PET reconstruction. The anatomical MR information is modeled as a priori distribution of the PET image and combined with the distribution of the measured PET data to generate the a posteriori function from which the expectation maximization (EM)-type algorithm with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator is derived. One algorithm (Markov-GEM) uses a Gibbs function to model interactions between neighboring pixels within the anatomical regions. The other (Gauss-EM) applies a Gauss function with the same mean for all pixels in a given anatomical region. A basic assumption of these methods is that the radioactivity is homogeneously distributed inside anatomical regions. Simulated and phantom data are investigated under the following aspects: count density, object size, missing anatomical information, and misregistration of the anatomical information. Compared with the maximum likelihood-expectation maximization (ML-EM) algorithm the results of both algorithms show a large reduction of noise with a better delineation of borders. Of the two algorithms tested, the Gauss-EM method is superior in noise reduction (up to 50%). Regarding incorrect a priori information the Gauss-EM algorithm is very sensitive, whereas the Markov-GEM algorithm proved to be stable with a small change of recovery coefficients between 0.5 and 3%.", "year": 1997}, {"paperId": "a754ae4009588184a35173c0a6848afd3f912a2b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2770950817", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/AAC0C1", "CorpusId": 49210979}, "title": "Ratcheting ambition to limit warming to 1.5\u2009\u00b0C\u2013trade-offs between emission reductions and carbon dioxide removal", "abstract": "Mitigation scenarios to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C or less in 2100 often rely on large amounts of carbon dioxide removal (CDR), with significant potential social, environmental, political and economic risks. A precautionary approach to scenario creation is therefore indicated. This letter presents the results of such a precautionary modelling exercise in which the models C-ROADS and En-ROADS were used to generate a series of 1.5\u00b0C mitigation scenarios that apply increasingly stringent constraints on the scale and type of CDR available. This allows us to explore the trade-offs between near-term stringency of emissions reductions and assumptions about future availability of CDR. In particular, we find that regardless of CDR assumptions, near-term ambition increase (\"ratcheting\") is required for any 1.5\u00b0C pathways, making this letter timely for the facilitative, or Talanoa, dialogue to be conducted by the UNFCCC in 2018. By highlighting the difference between net and gross reduction rates, often obscured in scenarios with large-scale CDR, we find that mid-term gross CO2 emissions reduction rates in scenarios with CDR constraints increase to levels without historical precedence. This in turn highlights, in addition to the need to substantially increase CO2 reduction rates, the need to improve emissions reductions for non-CO2 greenhouse gases. Further, scenarios in which all or part of the CDR is implemented as non-permanent storage exhibit storage loss emissions, which partly offset CDR, highlighting the importance of differentiating between net and gross CDR in scenarios. We find in some scenarios, storage loss trending to similar values as gross CDR, indicating that gross CDR would have to be maintained simply to offset the storage losses of CO2 sequestered earlier, without any additional net climate benefit.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "d4005a551c0f1a7bd0c5307996bb3230cfb9d769", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2058740478", "DOI": "10.1139/X98-023", "CorpusId": 85141777}, "title": "Effects of a clear-cut harvest on soil respiration in a jack pine - lichen woodland", "abstract": "Quantification of the components of ecosystem respiration is essential to understanding carbon (C) cycling of natural and disturbed landscapes.

We measured soil respiration (soil CO2 emission) at an undisturbed mature jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) stand in Saskatchewan (old jack pine, OJP), and at a formerly continuous portion of the stand that was clear-cut during the previous winter (clear-cut, CC). Tree harvesting reduced soil CO2 emission from ~22.5 to ~9.1 mol CO2 cdot m-2 for the 1994 growing season. OJP was a small net sink of atmospheric CO2, while CC was a net source of CO2. Winter emissions were similar at both sites. Reduction of soil respiration was attributed to disruption of the soil surface and to the death of tree roots.

Future drought frequencies are estimated based on ensemble results from 20 general circulation model (GCM) climate change patterns and 6 emissions scenarios from SRES (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) using a revised Palmer Drought Severity Index. The drought risk index was established by combining the effects of drought-disaster frequency, drought severity, production (yield) and extent of irrigation. Results indicate that, for most regions, the probability density functions (PDF) of the 120 drought disaster frequency projections for 2100 show quasi-normal distributions and consistently project higher drought disaster frequency (DDF) than that of baseline, which indicates an overall enhanced drought risk in the future climate change. Globally, the drought disaster-affected area will increase with the rising global temperature, from 15.4 to 44.00% by 2100. The average cropland drought risk index (DRI) doubles from 52.45 to 104.60 in 2050 projections. In 2100, the projection for the DRI increases to 129.40. Among the regions, Africa is ranked as the highest, with a baseline DRI value of 95.77 which increases to 205.46 in 2100 projec- tions. Correspondingly, the rates of yield reduction related to drought disaster for major crops will increase significantly with future climate change, by >50% in 2050 and almost 90% in 2100 for the major crops.
