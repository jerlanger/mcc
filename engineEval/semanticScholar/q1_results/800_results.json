Documenting these strengths and weaknesses on the basis of historical simulations is essential before the models are used to investigate future air quality projections. To achieve this, a coordinated modelling exercise was performed in the framework of the CityZEN European Project. It involved six regional and global chemistry-transport models (Bolchem, Chimere, Emep, Eurad, OsloCTM2 and Mozart) simulating air quality over the past decade in the Western European anthropogenic emissions hotspots. Comparisons between models and observations allow assessing the skills of the models to capture the trends in basic atmospheric constituents (NO2, O3, and PM10). We find that the trends of primary constituents are well reproduced (except in some countries - owing to their sensitivity to the emission inventory) although capturing the more moderate trends of secondary species such as O3 is more challenging. Apart from the long term trend, the modelled monthly variability is consistent with the observations but the year-to-year variability is generally underestimated. A comparison of simulations where anthropogenic emissions are kept constant is also investigated. We find that the magnitude of the emission-driven trend exceeds the natural variability for primary compounds. We can thus conclude that emission management strategies have had a significant impact over the past 10 yr, hence supporting further emission reductions strategies.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "140a063a509f7e81e3c167a6c6dc6ed8f1af0134", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2624639912", "CorpusId": 157741540}, "title": "The Economics of Climate Change in Southeast Asia: A Regional Review", "abstract": "This report reviews the economics of climate change in Southeast Asia, with a particular focus on Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Viet Nam.

The additional CH4 from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in CO2 forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. We also consider the effects of: methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation. On balance, these factors more than offset the reduction in warming due to reduced CO2 emissions.

To do so, biofuel production must generate and use 'additional carbon', which means carbon that plants would not otherwise absorb or that would be emitted to the atmosphere anyway. When biofuels cause no direct land use change, they use crops that would grow regardless of biofuels so they do not directly absorb additional carbon. All potential greenhouse gas reductions from such biofuels, as well as many potential emission increases, result from indirect effects, including reduced crop consumption, price-induced yield gains and land conversion. If lifecycle analyses ignore indirect effects of biofuels, they therefore cannot properly find greenhouse gas reductions. Uncertainties in estimating indirect emission reductions and increases are largely symmetrical. The failure to distinguish 'additional' carbon from carbon already absorbed or withheld from the atmosphere also leads to large overestimates of global bioenergy potential. Reasonable confidence in greenhouse gas reductions requires a precautionary approach to estimating indirect effects that does not rely on any single model.

In a first set of pathways, the timing of emission reductions is such that over the 2010\u20132100 period, assuming full participation from 2013 onwards, mitigation costs are minimized. In a second set of pathways, we set emissions in 2020 at a level based on the pledges of the Copenhagen Accord.

Contrasting, in the \u2018Copenhagen Current\u2019 scenario, climate talks fall short of satisfying the conditions to move beyond current unilateral pledges. We include scenarios with and without the availability of bio-energy in combination with carbon capture and storage. We find that for a \u2018Copenhagen Potential\u2019 scenario, emissions by 2020 are higher (47 GtCO2eq/yr) than for a least-cost pathway for 2\u00b0C (43 GtCO2eq/yr with a 40\u201346\u00a0GtCO2eq/yr literature range). In the \u2018Copenhagen Potential\u2019 scenario the 2\u00b0C target can still be met with a likely chance, although discounted mitigation costs over 2010\u20132100 could be 10 to 15\u00a0% higher, and up to 60\u00a0% in the 2040\u20132050s, than for least-cost pathways. For the \u2018Current Copenhagen\u2019 scenario, maintaining an equally low probability of exceeding 2\u00b0C becomes infeasible in our model, implying higher costs due to higher climate risks. We conclude that there is some flexibility in terms of 2020 emissions compared to the optimal pathways but this is limited. The 2020 emission level represents a trade-off between short-term emission reductions and long-term dependence on rapid reductions through specific technologies (like negative emission reductions).

The need for agricultural involvement in GHG mitigation has been widely recognized since the 1990s. The concept of C sinks, C credits, and emission trading has attracted special interests in herbaceous and woody species as energy crops and source of biofuel feedstock. Bioenergy crops are defined as any plant material used to produce bioenergy. These crops have the capacity to produce large volume of biomass, high energy potential, and can be grown in marginal soils. Planting bioenergy crops in degraded soils is one of the promising agricultural options with C sequestration rates ranging from 0.6 to 3.0 Mg C ha\u22121 yr\u22121. About 60 million hectares (Mha) of land is available in the United States and 757 Mha in the world to grow bioenergy crops. With an energy offset of 1 kg of C in biomass per 0.6 kg of C in fossil fuel, there exists a vast potential of offsetting fossil fuel emission. Bioenergy crops have the potential to sequester approximately 318 Tg C yr\u22121 in the United States and 1631 Tg C yr\u22121 worldwide. Bioenergy crops consist of herbaceous bunch-type grasses and short-rotation woody perennials. Important grasses include switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), elephant grass (Pennissetum purpureum Schum.), tall fescue (Fetusca arundinacea L.), etc. Important among short-rotation woody perennials are poplar (Populus spp.), willow (Salix spp.), mesquite (Prosopis spp.), etc. The emissions of CO2 from using switchgrass as energy crop is 1.9 kg C Gj\u22121 compared with 13.8, 22.3, and 24.6 kg C Gj\u22121 from using gas, petroleum, and coal, respectively. Mitigation of GHG emissions cannot be achieved by C sinks alone, a substantial reduction in fossil fuel combustion will be necessary.

A model of the supply and demand chain of biojet involving farmers, biorefineries, airlines, and policymakers is developed by considering factors that drive the decisions of actors (i.e., decision-makers and stakeholders) in the life cycle stages. Two kinds of feedstock are considered: oil-producing feedstock (i.e., camelina and algae) and lignocellulosic biomass (i.e., corn stover, switchgrass, and short rotation woody crops). By factoring in farmer/feedstock producer and biorefinery profitability requirements and risk attitudes, land availability and suitability, as well as a time delay and technological learning factor, a more realistic estimate of the level of biojet supply and emissions reduction can be developed under different oil price assumptions. Factors that drive biojet GHG emissions and unit production costs from each feedstock are identified and quantified. Overall, this study finds that at likely adoption rates biojet alone would not be sufficient to achieve the aviation emissions reduction target.

Simulations are run until the year 3000 A.D. and extend substantially farther into the future than conceptually similar simulations with atmosphere\u2013ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) coupled to carbon cycle models. In this paper the following are investigated: 1) the climate change commitment in response to stabilized greenhouse gases and stabilized total radiative forcing, 2) the climate change commitment in response to earlier CO2 emissions, and 3) emission trajectories for profiles leading to the stabilization of atmospheric CO2 and their uncertainties due to carbon cycle processes. Results over the twenty-first century compare reasonably well with results from AOGCMs, and the suite of EMICs proves well suited to complement more complex models. Substantial climate change commitments for sea level rise and global mean surface temperature increase after a stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gases and radiative forcing in the year 2100 are identified. The additional warming by the year 3000 is 0.6\u20131.6 K for the low-CO2 IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) B1 scenario and 1.3\u20132.2 K for the high-CO2 SRES A2 scenario. Correspondingly, the post-2100 thermal expansion commitment is 0.3\u20131.1 m for SRES B1 and 0.5\u20132.2 m for SRES A2. Sea level continues to rise due to thermal expansion for several centuries after CO2 stabilization. In contrast, surface temperature changes slow down after a century. The meridional overturning circulation is weakened in all EMICs, but recovers to nearly initial values in all but one of the models after centuries for the scenarios considered. Emissions during the twenty-first century continue to impact atmospheric CO2 and climate even at year 3000. All models find that most of the anthropogenic carbon emissions are eventually taken up by the ocean (49%\u201362%) in year 3000, and that a substantial fraction (15%\u201328%) is still airborne even 900 yr after carbon emissions have ceased. Future stabilization of atmospheric CO2 and climate change requires a substantial reduction of CO2 emissions below present levels in all EMICs. This reduction needs to be substantially larger if carbon cycle\u2013climate feedbacks are accounted for or if terrestrial CO2 fertilization is not operating. Large differences among EMICs are identified in both the response to increasing atmospheric CO2 and the response to climate change.

This study quantifies the potential of electric and hybrid-electric powertrains, such as gasoline hybrid-electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), fuel-cell vehicles (FCVs), and battery-electric vehicles (BEVs), to offer such reductions. The evolution of key enabling technologies was evaluated over a 30 year time horizon. These results were integrated with software simulations to model vehicle performance and tank-towheel energy consumption; the technology evaluation was also used to estimate costs. Well-towheel energy and GHG emissions of future vehicle technologies were estimated by integrating the vehicle technology evaluation with assessments of different fuel pathways. While electric powertrains can reduce or eliminate the transport sector's reliance on petroleum, their GHG and energy reduction potential are constrained by continued reliance on fossil-fuels for producing electricity and hydrogen. In addition, constraints on growth of new vehicle technologies and slow rates of fleet turnover imply that these technologies take decades to effect meaningful change. As such, they do not offer a silver bullet: new technologies must be deployed in combination with other aggressive measures such as improved conventional technology, development of low-carbon fuels and fuel production pathways, and demand-side reductions. The results do not suggest a clear winner amongst the technologies evaluated, although the hybrid vehicle is most likely to offer a dominant path through the first half of the century, based on its position as an established technology, a projection that shows continued improvement and narrowing cost relative to conventional technologies, and similar GHG reduction benefits to other technologies as long as they rely on traditional fuel pathways. The plug-in hybrid, while more costly than hybrid vehicles, offers greater opportunity to reduce GHG emissions and petroleum use, and faces lower technical risk and fewer infrastructure hurdles than fuel-cell or battery-electric vehicles. Fuel-cell vehicle technology has shown significant improvement in the last several years, but questions remain as to its technical feasibility and the relative benefit of hydrogen as a transportation fuel.

The temperature response of increasing GHG concentrations and reduced aerosol emissions leads to a global annual mean equilibrium temperature response of 2.18\u00a0K.

This paper suggests two approaches for accounting for carbon dioxide emissions from tourism: a bottom-up analysis involving industry and tourist analyses, and a top-down analysis using environmental accounting. Using the case study of New Zealand, we demonstrate that both approaches result in similar estimates of the degree to which tourism contributes to national carbon dioxide emissions. The bottom-up analysis provides detailed information on energy end-uses and the main drivers of carbon dioxide emissions. These results can be used for the development of targeted industry-based greenhouse gas reduction strategies.

Both tools were applied to two month long (February and July) PM modeling episodes and evaluated against changes in PM concentrations due to various emission reductions. The results show that source contributions calculated by PSAT start to deviate from the actual model responses as indirect effects from limiting reactants or nonprimary precursor emissions become important The DDM first-order sensitivity is useful for determining source contributions only if the model response to input changes is reasonably linear. For secondary inorganic PM, the response is linear for emission reductions of 20% in all cases considered and reasonably linear for reductions of 100% inthe case of on-road mobile sources.

Impact of future technologies on scenarios until 2050", "abstract": "[1]\u00a0In this study the today's fleet-average emission factors of the most important ship exhausts are used to calculate emission scenarios for the future. To develop plausible future technology scenarios, first upcoming regulations and compliance with future regulations through technological improvements are discussed. We present geographically resolved emission inventory scenarios until 2050, based on a mid-term prognosis for 2020 and a long-term prognosis for 2050. The scenarios are based on some very strict assumptions on future ship traffic demands and technological improvements. The four future ship traffic demand scenarios are mainly determined by the economic growth, which follows the IPCC SRES storylines. The resulting fuel consumption is projected through extrapolations of historical trends in economic growth, total seaborne trade and number of ships, as well as the average installed power per ship. For the future technology scenarios we assume a diesel-only fleet in 2020 resulting in fuel consumption between 382 and 409 million metric tons (Mt). For 2050 one technology scenario assumes that 25% of the fuel consumed by a diesel-only fleet can be saved by applying future alternative propulsion plants, resulting in a fuel consumption that varies between 402 and 543 Mt. The other scenario is a business-as-usual scenario for a diesel-only fleet even in 2050 and gives an estimate between 536 and 725 Mt. Dependent on how rapid technology improvements for diesel engines are introduced, possible technology reduction factors are applied to the today's fleet-average emission factors of all important species to estimate future ship emissions. Combining the four traffic demand scenarios with the four technology scenarios, our results suggest emissions between 8.8 and 25.0 Tg (NO2) in 2020, and between 3.1 to 38.8 Tg (NO2) in 2050. The development of forecast scenarios for CO2, NOx, SOx, CO, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter is driven by the requirements for global model studies of the effects of these emissions on the chemical composition of the atmosphere and on climate.

Meteorological inputs to the CMAQ chemical transport model are developed by downscaling the GISS Global Climate Model simulations using an MM5-based regional climate model. Future-year emissions for North America are developed by growing the US EPA CAIR inventory, Mexican and Canadian emissions and by using the IMAGE model with the IPCC A1B emissions scenario that is also used in projecting future climate. Reductions of more than 50% in NOX and SO2 emissions are forecast. The impacts of global climate change alone on regional air quality are small compared to impacts from emission control-related reductions in the US and Canada. The combined effect of climate change and emission reductions lead to a 20% decrease (regionally varying from -11% to -28% regionally) in the mean summer maximum daily 8-hr ozone levels (M8hO3) over the US, -8% over Canada and -10% over Northern Mexico.

Major reductions are expected in sulfate, nitrate and ammonium fractions of annually-averaged PM2.5 for all sub-regions. The limited reduction in organic carbon over the US and Northern Mexico and the higher concentrations over Canada suggests that organic carbon will be the dominant component of PM2.5 mass over most of the continent in the future. Regionally, the Eastern US benefits more than the rest of the regions from reductions in both M8hO3 and PM2.5, due to both spatial variations in the meteorological and emissions changes.

Using a global atmospheric chemistry model, we have quantified for the first time, intercontinental transboundary contributions to crop ozone exposure and subsequent yield reductions in the Northern Hemisphere. We apply four metrics (AOT40, M7, M12, W126) to assess the impacts of 100% reductions in anthropogenic NOx emissions from North (N) America, South East (SE) Asia and Europe on global and regional exposure of 6 major agricultural crop types to surface ozone, and resultant crop production losses during the year 2000 growing season. Using these metrics, model calculations show that for wheat, rice, cotton and potato, 100 % reductions in SE Asian anthropogenic NOx emissions tend to produce the greatest global reduction in crop production losses (42.3\u201395.2%), and a 100 % reduction to N~American anthropogenic NOx emissions results in the greatest global impact on crop production losses for maize and soybean (59.2\u201385.9%). A 100% reduction in N~American anthropogenic NOx emissions produces the largest transboundary impact, resulting in European production loss reductions of between 14.2% and 63.2%. European NOx emissions tend to produce a smaller transboundary impact, due to inefficiency of transport from the European domain. The threshold nature of the AOT40 ozone-exposure metric results in strong dependence of non-local emissions impacts on the local ozone concentration distribution. Our calculations of absolute crop production change under emission reduction scenarios differ between the metrics used, however we find the relative importance of each region's transboundary impact remains robust between metrics. Our results demonstrate that local air quality and emission control strategies have the potential to partly alleviate ozone-induced crop yield loss in continents downstream, in addition to effectively mitigating local ozone-induced production losses.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "08fbf411feeea1f1ae4bde7e47852214ce5279bb", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 111383960}, "title": "Accumulation by Decarbonization and the Governance of Carbon Offsets", "abstract": "ing and Owning Carbon For emissions reductions to be claimed through offsets, tonnes of carbon dioxide that are reduced need to be assigned rights of ownership so that they can be traded as a commodity. Ownership can take a variety of different forms: a local community may own and use the wood grown in a forest for carbon sequestration, but a foreign investor or project developer may own the carbon reductions (as credits) created through the forest. Likewise the emissions from a polluting factory may \u201cbelong\u201d to the factory owners, but the emissions equivalent values once reduced may then belong to another company that implements the reductions as a carbon offset project. Legal title for carbon reductions is usually provided by an emissions-reduction purchase agreement (ERPA) signed by a buyer and seller of the tonnes of carbon that legally binds the future rights of the carbon commodity, including \u201cany right, interest, credit, entitlement, benefit or allowance to emit (present or future) .|.|. in connection with any GHG [greenhouse gas] Reduction by the [CDM] Project\u201d (IETA 2004, section 3.01).

In the VCO market, agreements may be less formal, with project developers simply claiming the rights to the information that is used to generate credits.

Carbon reductions are therefore \u201ccreated,\u201d given ownership, and abstracted from their physical site of reduction using ERPAs.

International cooperation to reduce emissions for this type of problems often takes the form of an agreement among the cooperating countries to cut back emissions by a uniform percent rate compared with some base year. This type of agreements has two disadvantages. In the first place, it is well known from environmental economics that equal percentage reductions of emissions from different sources usually gives an inefficient outcome, in the sense that the same environmental goals could be achieved at lower costs through a different distribution of emission reductions. A second problem with agreements of equal percentage reductions is that not all countries will find it in their interest to participate in such agreements. In the paper, it is assumed that the set of countries which participate in an agreement is endogenously determined, with a country participating in an agreement provided that this makes the country better off than it would have been in a situation without any agreement. The agreement among the participating countries is assumed to be a uniform percentage reduction of their emissions. The countries have different opinions about what this uniform percentage should be. In the paper, it is assumed that the outcome is determined by the median country of the participating countries.

Buildings and the building stock can play a major role in mitigating climate change in the short- to medium-term, since substantial reductions in CO2 emissions from their energy use can be achieved over the coming years. A significant portion of these savings can be achieved in ways that reduce life cycle costs, thus providing reductions in CO2 emissions that have a net negative cost. There are indications that the building stock has the highest share of negative- and low-cost greenhouse gas reduction potential among all sectors. Based on 80 collected national or regional studies estimating CO2 mitigation potential in five continents, the global potential for CO2 reductions through buildings is analysed and estimated. The co-benefits associated with the implementation of these measures are also substantial, helping policy-makers justify actions even in the absence of a strong climate commitment. Since the barriers to unlocking the high potentials in the residential and commercial sectors are especially strong, no single instrument can make a large impact. Instead, portfolios of targeted policies tailored to local conditions, combined with strong compliance and enforcement regimes, are needed.

Such reduction is achieved by including emissions either as a constraint or as a weighted function the objective of the overall dispatching problem. >", "year": 1994}, {"paperId": "92a745febb092238794b2ecb9bff4e6624ca6c96", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1973396862", "DOI": "10.1017/S1355770X97000235", "CorpusId": 17737367}, "title": "The relationship between air pollution emissions and income: US Data", "abstract": "Considerable interest has focused on the possible existence of an environmental Kuznets curve, whereby pollution first increases but later falls with increasing income. Empirical studies have concentrated on a wide spectrum of countries and run into inevitable problems of data comparability and quality. We avoid these problems by looking at seven types of air emissions across the 50 US states and find all seven pollutants decrease with increasing per capita income. We also find strong evidence of heteroscedasticity with respect to the income\u2013emissions relationship: lower-income states display much greater variability in per capita emission levels than higher-income states. Additionally, we look at the best measured of these emissions, air toxics, for the period 1988\u201394. Using a simple sign test, we find support for the notion that an increase in income is associated with a decrease in per capita emissions. However, the change in emissions appears to be unrelated to the magnitude of the change in income. We do find, though, that the reduction in per capita emissions is increasing both in terms of the 1988 level of per capita emissions and income. Possible implications of these results for the development process are discussed.", "year": 1997}, {"paperId": "3506ff890cb0e5b9dd3f34b26ccf06092d28a100", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2007863246", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1475-2743.2002.tb00258.x", "CorpusId": 95585744}, "title": "The use of a nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), to decrease nitrate leaching and nitrous oxide emissions in a simulated grazed and irrigated grassland", "abstract": "Abstract. In grazed dairy pasture systems, a major source of NO3\u2013 leached and N2O emitted is the N returned in the urine from the grazing animal. The objective of this study was to use lysimeters to measure directly the effectiveness of a nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), in decreasing NO3\u2013 leaching and N2O emissions from urine patches in a grazed dairy pasture under irrigation. The soil was a free\u2010draining Lismore stony silt loam (Udic Haplustept loamy skeletal) and the pasture was a mixture of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and white clover (Trifolium repens). The use of DCD decreased NO3\u2013\u2010N leaching by 76% for the urine N applied in the autumn, and by 42% for urine N applied in the spring, giving an annual average reduction of 59%. This would reduce the NO3\u2013\u2010N leaching loss in a grazed paddock from 118 to 46 kg N ha\u20131 yr\u20131. The NO3\u2013\u2010N concentration in the drainage water would be reduced accordingly from 19.7 to 7.7 mg N L\u20131, with the latter being below the drinking water guideline of 11.3 mg N L\u20131. Total N2O emissions following two urine applications were reduced from 46 kg N2O\u2010N ha\u20131 without DCD to 8.5 kg N2O\u2010N with DCD, representing an 82% reduction. In addition to the environmental benefits, the use of DCD also increased herbage production by more than 30%, from 11 to 15 t ha\u20131 yr\u20131. The use of DCD therefore has the potential to make dairy farming more environmentally sustainable by reducing NO3\u2013 leaching and N2O emissions.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "b5825cb033f4084249605967b439d85680e22610", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1991690201", "DOI": "10.1021/EF900448M", "CorpusId": 95454260}, "title": "Effect of Ethanol on Blending Stability and Diesel Engine Emissions", "abstract": "The stability diagrams of ethanol (e)\u2212biodiesel (b)\u2212diesel blends were studied at different temperatures.

An adjoint version of a global transport model has been used to estimate these fluxes at a relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. Measurements from 34 monitoring stations and 11 locations along two ship cruises by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration have been used as input. Recent estimates of methane sources, including a number of minor ones, have been used as a priori constraints. For the target period 1993-1995 our inversion reduces the a priori assumed global methane emissions of 528 to 505 Tg(CH 4 ) yr -1 a posteriori. Further, the relative contribution of the Northern Hemispheric sources decreases from 77% a priori to 67% a posteriori. In addition to making the emission estimate more consistent with the measurements, the inversion helps to reduce the uncertainties in the sources. Uncertainty reductions vary from 75% on the global scale to \u223c1% on the grid-scale (8\u00b0\u00d710\u00b0), indicating that the grid scale variability is not resolved by the measurements. Large scale features such as the interhemispheric methane concentration gradient are relatively well resolved and therefore impose strong constraints on the estimated fluxes. The capability of the model to reproduce this gradient is critically dependent on the accuracy at which the interhemispheric tracer exchange and the large-scale hydroxyl radical distribution are represented. As a consequence, the inversion-derived emission estimates are sensitive to errors in the transport model and the calculated hydroxyl radical distribution. In fact, a considerable contribution of these model errors cannot be ignored. This underscores that source quantification by inverse modeling is limited by the extent to which the rate of interhemispheric transport and the hydroxyl radical distribution can be validated. We show that the use of temporal and spatial correlations of emissions may significantly improve our results; however, at present the experimental support for such correlations is lacking.

Combining estimates of health benefits per ton with potential emission reductions, the greatest mortality reduction of 12,000 fewer deaths per year [95% confidence interval (CI), 1,200\u201324,000] was associated with controlling primary PM2.5 emissions from the industry sector and reducing sulfur dioxide (SO2) from the power sector, respectively.

We simulated soil carbon sequestration (or net CO2 emission) and CH4 and N2O emissions from China's rice paddies (30 million ha), based on 1990 climate and management conditions, with two water management scenarios: continuous flooding and midseason drainage. The results indicated that this change in water management has reduced aggregate CH4 emissions about 40%, or 5 Tg CH4 yr\u22121, roughly 5\u201310% of total global methane emissions from rice paddies. The mitigating effect of midseason drainage on CH4 flux was highly uneven across the country; the highest flux reductions (>200 kg CH4\u2010C ha\u22121 yr\u22121) were in Hainan, Sichuan, Hubei, and Guangdong provinces, with warmer weather and multiple\u2010cropping rice systems.

This is inevitable as much of the predicted climate changes over the next 30-40 years have already been predetermined by past and present emissions of GHGs. Change is likely to be significant. Understanding what the risks are likely to be and how best to adapt to them is therefore central to any mature climate change strategy. However, the inevitable linkages between adaptation and mitigation measures represent a particular challenge. Focusing on the consequences of climate change for the urban environment (where most of the population is concentrated and where its impact is likely to be most keenly felt), this paper suggests preferred adaptation options and provides an evaluation of how these may act to reinforce or hamper mitigation efforts. For example, moves towards urban densification may contribute to the reduction of energy use, yet will have negative implications for adaptation.

To gather information about fermentation effects, unfermented slurry was also tested, but with trail hose application only. Co-fermented slurry was applied in April at a rate of 30 m3 ha(-1). Measurements were made every 4 h on the first day after application and were continued for 6 wk with gradually decreasing sampling frequency. Methane emissions were <150 g C ha(-1) from co-fermentation products and seemed to result from dissolved CH4. Only in the grassland experiment were emissions from unfermented slurry significantly higher, with wetter weather conditions probably promoting CH4 production. Nitrous oxide emission was significantly increased by injection on arable and grassland sites two- and threefold, respectively. Ammonia emissions were smallest after injection or trail shoe application and are discussed in the preceding paper. We evaluated the climatic relevance of the measured gas emissions from the different application techniques based on the comparison of CO2 equivalents. It was evident that NH3 emission reduction, which can be achieved by injection, is at least compensated by increased N2O emissions.

A unified regional air-quality modelling system (AURAMS) was used to investigate the effects of reductions in ammonia emissions on regional air quality, with a focus on particulate-matter formation. Three simulations of one-year duration were performed for a North American domain: (1) a base-case simulation using 2002 Canadian and US national emissions inventories augmented by a more detailed Canadian emissions inventory for agricultural ammonia; (2) a 30% North-American-wide reduction in agricultural ammonia emissions; and (3) a 50% reduction in Canadian beef-cattle ammonia emissions. The simulations show that a 30% continent-wide reduction in agricultural ammonia emissions lead to reductions in median hourly PM2.5 mass of A key finding of the modelling work is the linkage between gas and aqueous chemistry and transport; reductions in ammonia emissions affect gaseous ammonia concentrations close to the emissions site, but substantial impacts on particulate matter and atmospheric deposition often occur at considerable distances downwind, with particle nitrate being the main vector of ammonia/um transport. Ammonia emissions reductions therefore have trans-boundary consequences downwind. Calculations of critical-load exceedances for sensitive ecosystems in Canada suggest that ammonia emission reductions will have a minimal impact on current ecosystem acidification within Canada, but may have a substantial impact on future ecosystem acidification. The 50% Canadian beef-cattle ammonia emissions reduction scenario was used to examine model sensitivity to uncertainties in the new Canadian agricultural ammonia emissions inventory, and the simulation results suggest that further work is needed to improve the emissions inventory for this particular sector.

The estimated emissions have been used as input to the sulphur module of the EMEP/MSC-W acid deposition model. The aim was to show the way and the extent to which the historical development of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide emissions alone has affected the concentration and deposition fields of oxidised sulphur in Europe. Although acknowledged, effects exerted by the meteorological variability and the changing oxidising capacity of the atmosphere over the years have not been taken into consideration. Long-term emission estimates reveal that combustion of coal was the dominant emission source before World War II in all countries and combustion of liquid fuels thereafter in most. Releases from industrial processes were relatively small. National sulphur dioxide emissions peaked mainly in the 1960s and 1970s, whilst emission control measures resulted in gradual reductions in most countries in the 1980s. In Europe as a whole, coal combustion remained the major emission source throughout the century. Total anthropogenic releases increased by a factor of 10 between the 1880 s and 1970s when they peaked at approximately 55 million tonnes of sulphur dioxide, followed by a 30% decline in the 1980s. Uncertainties in national emission estimates due to uncertain sulphur contents in fossil fuels are within \u00b1 30% for 22 out of 28 countries and \u00b1 45% for the rest. The location of emission sources in Europe has shown over the years a progressive detachment from the coalfields towards a widespread distribution, accompanied in the last decades by considerable emission reductions over north-western and parts of central Europe and substantial increases in the south and south-east. Modelled air concentrations and depositions reflect to a great extent the emission pattern, revealing two- to six-fold increases between the 1880 s and 1970s. Maximum sulphur loadings are confined over parts of north-western and central Europe. Accumulated depositions over the period 1880\u20131991 in these areas reach 600 g (S) m \u22122 . Emissions are principally in the form of sulphur dioxide, so that comparable concentrations of particulate sulphate in low emission regions indicate the importance of long range transport. Assuming a constant ecosystem sensitivity throughout the period, depositions sufficient to cause ecosystem damage may have occurred before 1880 in many areas of north-western and central Europe. Nevertheless, in large parts of eastern and southern Europe depositions are still below these critical loads.

Some have suggested that a gradual departure from the emissions baseline will be the most cost-effective because it reduces the pressure for premature retirement of the existing capital stock, and it provides valuable time to develop low-cost, low-carbon emitting substitutes. Others counter that a major flaw in analyses that support this line of reasoning is that they ignore learning-by-doing (LBD). In this paper, we examine the impact of LBD on the timing and costs of emissions abatement. With regard to timing, we find that including learning-by-doing does not significantly alter the conclusions of previous studies that treated technology cost as exogenous. The analysis supports the earlier conclusion that for a wide range of stabilization ceilings, a gradual transition away from the \"no policy\" emissions baseline is preferable to one that requires substantial near-term reductions.

In traditional cage systems and alternative, welfare-oriented, housing systems for laying hens two types of waste can be distinguished, namely manure and litter. Manure is encountered as slurry or as dry manure. Litter on the floor is a dry and granular mixture of faeces and e.g. sand. It is used by the hens for dust bathing and scratching. In the processes involved in the emission of ammonia, the most important process parameters are temperature, Ph and water activity, i.e. the availability of water for micro-organisms in the substrate. Air temperature, relative humidity and air velocity define the influencing climatic conditions best. Despite the effectiveness of Ph control, application of this measure has too many negative side-effects. Forced drying of manure seems the only effective and acceptable way for temporary control of ammonia emissions inside housing systems. Regular removal of manure out of the house is always necessary. \n \nReduction of ammonia emissions can be achieved by changing over from housing systems with composting (emission rate 386 g NH3/hen a) to battery systems with manure belts underneath the cages (emission rate 34 g NH3/(hen a), which enable drying of manure and regular removal. The drying rate of the manure and the frequency of removal are crucial in relation to the emission. Minimum emission from manure is achieved if a dry matter content of 60% is reached within 50 h after excretion of the faeces. The emission from battery systems with belts can be reduced to 10 g NH3/(hen a) if the manure is removed from the house twice daily instead of twice weekly. The emissions of ammonia from alternative housing systems with litter are several times higher compared with battery cages with belts, due to the long stay of litter inside the house. A higher dry matter content of litter slows down the volatilization of ammonia, but practical means to reduce the emission from litter in this way are not yet available.

Consequently, these emissions need to be low enough to not cause opacity violations and acid deposition. Generally, a small fraction of sulfur (S) in coal is converted to SO3 in coal-fired combustion devices such as electric utility boilers. The emissions of SO3 from such a boiler depend on coal S content, combustion conditions, flue gas characteristics, and air pollution devices being used. It is well known that the catalyst used in the selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology for nitrogen oxides control oxidizes a small fraction of sulfur dioxide in the flue gas to SO3. The extent of this oxidation depends on the catalyst formulation and SCR operating conditions. Gas-phase SO3 and sulfuric acid, on being quenched in plant equipment (e.g., air preheater and wet scrubber), result in fine acidic mist, which can cause increased plume opacity and undesirable emissions. Recently, such effects have been observed at plants firing high-S coal and equipped with SCR systems and wet scrubbers.

There are two main effects that a substantial price on CO2 emissions would have in the short run (before the generation fleet changes significantly). First, consumers would react to increased price by buying less, described by their price elasticity of demand. Second, a price on CO2 emissions would change the order in which existing generators are economically dispatched, depending on their carbon dioxide emissions and marginal fuel prices. Both the price increase and dispatch changes depend on the mix of generation technologies and fuels in the region available for dispatch, although the consumer response to higher prices is the dominant effect. We estimate that the instantaneous imposition of a price of $35 per metric ton on CO2 emissions would lead to a 10% reduction in CO2 emissions in PJM and MISO at a price elasticity of -0.1. Reductions in ERCOT would be about one-third as large. Thus, a price on CO2 emissions that has been shown in earlier workto stimulate investment in new generation technology also provides significant CO2 reductions before new technology is deployed at large scale.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "08657e30e8060a2e0be6d5c0cf96e5056f3e58bb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2033066640", "DOI": "10.1002/ENV.473", "CorpusId": 122258061}, "title": "A high frequency kriging approach for non\u2010stationary environmental processes", "abstract": "Emission reductions were mandated in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 with the expectation that they would result in major reductions in the concentrations of atmospherically transported pollutants. The emission reductions are intended to reduce public health risks and to protect sensitive ecosystems. To determine whether the emission reductions are having the intended effect on atmospheric concentrations, monitoring data must be analyzed taking into consideration the spatial structure shown by the data. Maps of pollutant concentrations and fluxes are useful over different geopolitical boundaries, to discover when, where, and to what extent the U.S. Nation's air quality is improving or declining. Since the spatial covariance structure shown by the data changes with location, the standard kriging methodology for spatial interpolation cannot be used because it assumes stationarity of the process.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "7467eb56bded52d58bf75383a775795a6bc4490b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2004812201", "DOI": "10.1021/ES020629X", "CorpusId": 40726556, "PubMed": "12380081"}, "title": "Modeling the effect of weekday-weekend differences in motor vehicle emissions on photochemical air pollution in central California.", "abstract": "Ambient ozone concentrations vary by day of week in some locations, often with higher concentrations observed on weekends in urban and downwind areas. Emissions of ozone precursors appear to be lower on weekends, so the behavior of ozone concentrations on weekends may indicate the outcome of particular ozone control strategies. To examine the influence of day-of-week differences in motor vehicle emissions on ambient ozone concentrations, we combine a fuel-based motor vehicle emission inventory containing weekend-specific activity with an Eulerian photochemical airshed model applied to central California. Emissions of NOx on weekends are approximately 30% lower than on weekdays due to a large drop in heavy-duty diesel truck activity, and emissions of VOC are only slightly lower on weekends. In rural areas, passenger car traffic and the associated emissions are highest on Fridays and Sundays. The combination of VOC sensitivity and reduced emissions of NOx on weekends results in higher ozone concentrations on weekends. Changes in the timing of emissions also contribute to the weekend ozone effect, but sensitivity tests show that changes in emissions timing have a minor effect compared to changes in total mass of emissions on weekends. Even in situations where reductions in NOx emissions lead to higher ozone concentrations, NOx reductions may still be necessary for control of other air pollutants such as nitrogen dioxide, nitric acid, and aerosol nitrate.", "year": 2002}]}
