CH4 produced at solid waste disposal sites contributes approximately 3\u00964 percent to the annual global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions from solid waste disposal are expected to increase with increasing global population and GDP. On the other hand, many cost-efficient emission reduction options are available. The rate of waste degradation in landfills depends on waste composition, climate and conditions in the landfill. Because the duration of CH4 generation is several decades, estimation of emissions from landfills requires modelling of waste disposal prior to the year whose emissions are of interest. In this study, countryor region-specific first-order decay (FOD) models based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines are used to estimate emissions from municipal solid waste disposal in landfills. In addition, IPCC methodology is used to estimate emissions from waste incineration. Five global scenarios are compiled from 1990 to 2050. These scenarios take into account political decision making and changes in the waste management system. In the Baseline scenario, waste generation is assumed to follow past and current trends using population and GDP as drivers. In the other scenarios, effects of increased incineration, increased recycling and increased landfill gas recovery on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are assessed. Economic maximum emission reduction potentials for these waste management options are estimated at different marginal cost levels for the year 2030 by using the Global TIMES model. Global emissions from landfills are projected to increase from 340 Tg CO2 eq in 1990 to 1500 Tg CO2 eq by 2030 and 2900 Tg CO2 eq by 2050 in the Baseline scenario.

In conjunction with hosting the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the municipal government implemented a series of stringent air quality control measures. To assess the impacts on variation of ambient non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), the whole air was sampled by canisters at one urban site and two suburban sites in Beijing, and 55 NMHC species were quantified by gas chromatography equipped with a quadrupole mass spectrometer and a flame ionization detector (GC/MSD/FID) as parts of the field Campaign for the Beijing Olympic Games Air Quality program (CareBeijing). According to the control measures, the data were presented according to four periods: 18\u201330 June, 8\u201319 July, 15\u201324 August (during the Olympic Games), and 6\u201315 September (during the Paralympic Games). Compared with the levels in June, the mixing ratios of NMHCs obtained in the Olympic and Paralympic Games periods were reduced by 35% and 25%, respectively. Source contributions were calculated using a chemical mass balance model (CMB 8.2). After implementing the control measures, emissions from target sources were obviously reduced, and reductions in vehicle exhaust could explain 48\u201382% of the reductions of ambient NMHCs. Reductions in emissions from gasoline evaporation, paint and solvent use, and the chemical industry contributed 9\u201340%, 3\u201324%, and 1\u20135%, respectively, to reductions of ambient NMHCs. Sources of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and biogenic emissions were not controlled, and contributions from these sources from July to September were stable or even higher than in June. Ozone formation potentials (OFPs) were calculated for the measured NMHCs. The total OFPs during the Olympic and Paralympic Games were reduced by 48% and 32%, respectively, compared with values in June. Reductions in the OFPs of alkenes and aromatics explained 77\u201392% of total OFP reductions. The alkenes and aromatics were mainly from vehicle exhausts, and reductions of vehicle exhaust gases explained 67\u201387% of reductions in alkenes and 38\u201380% of reductions in aromatics.

Here we show observational evidence for this effect with 2013\u20132018 summer data of hourly ozone and PM2.5 concentrations from 106 sites in the North China Plain. The observations show suppression of ozone pollution at high PM2.5 concentrations, consistent with a model simulation in which PM2.5 scavenging of HO2 and NOx depresses ozone concentrations by 25 ppb relative to PM2.5-free conditions. PM2.5 chemistry makes ozone pollution less sensitive to NOx emission controls, emphasizing the need for controlling emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which so far have not decreased in China. The new 2018\u20132020 Clean Air Action plan calls for a 10% decrease in VOC emissions that should begin to reverse the long-term ozone increase even as PM2.5 continues to decrease.

This paradox is explained by the fact that some of the approaches require that also the abatement costs are weighted \u2013 and this offsets the effect of the diverging cost-damage estimates. The model is then used to analyse the importance weighting may have on the overall cost-benefit analysis.

We find a simple robust relationship between the change in the 2100 CH4 concentration and the extra allowable cumulative carbon emissions between now and 2100 (0.27 \u00b1 0.05 GtC per ppb CH4). This relationship is independent of modelled climate sensitivity and precise temperature target, although later mitigation of CH4 reduces its value and thus methane reduction effectiveness. Up to 12% of this increase in allowable emissions is due to the effect of surface ozone. We conclude early mitigation of CH4 emissions would significantly increase the feasibility of stabilising global warming below 1.5 \u00b0C, alongside having co-benefits for human and ecosystem health.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "f47fa30f369b757b70ed561a99a352b4af3ddef0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "26115657", "DOI": "10.1021/EF7003706", "CorpusId": 92262975}, "title": "Effects of Methanol/Gasoline Blends on a Spark Ignition Engine Performance and Emissions", "abstract": "Three typical methanol\u2212gasoline blends M10, M20, and M85 containing 10%, 20%, and 85% of methanol by volume, respectively, were used to investigate the effects of different methanol/gasoline ratios on engine power, thermal efficiency, and emissions, especially the exhaust methanol emission.

The study of photochemical smog during this episode is of primary interest since weather conditions were so extreme for western Europe that they provide a worst case scenario for air quality. This episode also provides an interesting benchmark for the evaluation air quality models. We present and evaluate the results of a regional simulation of the episode with the CHIMERE chemistry-transport model. In a reference run, the simulated ozone concentrations are compared to surface observations obtained from 237 monitoring stations in Europe. Statistical scores on diurnal cycle, daily maxima, spatial structure of ozone concentrations, and AOT60 show that the simulated values compare very well with the observed ones, although extreme ozone peaks are underestimated probably due to a lack of model resolution. We describe the simulated impacts on ozone of theoretical emission reduction scenarios.

The results are focused on geographical variations and statistical correlations for the Hg-content in 1-kg pike (=FHg), and on computer simulations to get insights and data on the linkages between various historical Hg-emissions and FHg. Selected results: Increased FHg-values may be attributed to atmospheric emissions of Hg and to acid rain. Southern Sweden is significantly influenced by continental Hg-emissions. East Germany, Great Britain, West Germany and Poland seem to have contributed with the largest foreign Hg-amounts in the Swedish mor layer and, at the end, to increased Hg-concentrations in Swedish fish.

Only the differences between the scenarios were examined. The no-tilling scenario omitted both tilling and puddling, but included spraying of a non-selective herbicide and used a transplanter equipped with a rotor. Fertilization was a basal single application of controlled release fertilizer in nursery boxes for all scenarios. After transplanting, there were no differences in machine work, invested materials or rice yields between the scenarios. The no-tilling scenario saved on fuel consumption, totaling carbon dioxide (CO2) output of 42 kg ha\u22121, which was equal to the 6% reported GHG emissions from fuel consumption by operating machines during rice production in Japan. Methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from the paddy fields were also monitored and compared for the scenarios. Methane has a major effect on global warming as part of the GHG emitted from paddy fields. The cumulative CH4 emissions from the no-tilling cultivation were 43% lower than those from conventional puddling cultivation because the plow layer was more oxidative in no-tilling cultivation. The N2O emissions were not significantly different between the cultivation scenarios. There were no significant differences in soil respiration, soil carbon contents or straw yields between the cultivation scenarios. The effect of tillage on CO2 flux in the paddy fields did not seem to be significant in this study. Consequently, the GHG emissions from the no-tilling field counted as CO2 using global warming potentials were 1,741 kg CO2 ha\u22121 lower than those from the conventional puddling field. In conclusion, no-tilling rice cultivation has the potential to save 1,783 kg CO2 ha\u22121 calculated using the sum of fuel consumption and GHG emissions from paddy fields.

The additional CH4 from leakage adds to the radiative forcing of the climate system, offsetting the reduction in CO2 forcing that accompanies the transition from coal to gas. We also consider the effects of: methane leakage from coal mining; changes in radiative forcing due to changes in the emissions of sulfur dioxide and carbonaceous aerosols; and differences in the efficiency of electricity production between coal- and gas-fired power generation.

The crystal structure of complex 2 confirms the presence of a Ru(II)N6 central core derived from the terpyridine ligand and three N-bonded thiocyanates. Intermolecular H-bonding between carboxylates on neighboring terpyridines gives rise to 2-D H-bonded arrays. The absorption and emission maxima of the black dye show a bathochromic shift with decreasing pH and exhibit pH-dependent excited-state lifetimes. The red-shift of the emission maxima is due to better pi-acceptor properties of the acid form that lowers the energy of the CT excited state. The low-energy metal-to-ligand charge-transfer absorption band showed marked solvatochromism due to the presence of thiocyanate ligands. The Ru(II)/(III) oxidation potential of the black dye and the ligand-based reduction potential shifted cathodically with decreasing number of protons and showed more reversible character. The adsorption of complex 3 from methoxyacetonitrile solution onto transparent TiO(2) films was interpreted by a Langmuir isotherm yielding an adsorption equilibrium constant, K(ads), of (1.0 +/- 0.3) x 10(5) M(-1). The amount of dye adsorbed at monolayer saturation was (n(alpha) = 6.9 +/- 0.3) x 10(-)(8) mol/mg of TiO(2), which is around 30% less than that of the cis-di(thiocyanato)bis(2,2'-bipyridyl-4,4'-dicarboxylate)ruthenium(II) complex. The black dye, when anchored to nanocrystalline TiO(2) films achieves very efficient sensitization over the whole visible range extending into the near-IR region up to 920 nm, yielding over 80% incident photon-to-current efficiencies (IPCE).

These differences were almost exclusively due to the differences in fertilizers used in conventional and organic farming and were most strongly influenced by the higher cumulative energy demand and emissions associated with producing conventional nitrogen fertilizers compared to the green manure production used for biological nitrogen fixation in organic agriculture.

Variation in dietary N intake will particularly affect excretion of urinary N, which is much more vulnerable to losses than is faecal N. Our objective is to review dietary effects on the level and form of N excreted in cattle urine, as well as its consequences for emissions of N2O. The quantity of N excreted in urine varies widely. Urinary N excretion, in particular that of urea N, is decreased upon reduction of dietary N intake or an increase in the supply of energy to the rumen microorganisms and to the host animal itself. Most of the N in urine (from 50% to well over 90%) is present in the form of urea. Other nitrogenous components include purine derivatives (PD), hippuric acid, creatine and creatinine. Excretion of PD is related to rumen microbial protein synthesis, and that of hippuric acid to dietary concentration of degradable phenolic acids. The N concentration of cattle urine ranges from 3 to 20 g/l. High-dietary mineral levels increase urine volume and lead to reduced urinary N concentration as well as reduced urea concentration in plasma and milk. In lactating dairy cattle, variation in urine volume affects the relationship between milk urea and urinary N excretion, which hampers the use of milk urea as an accurate indicator of urinary N excretion. Following its deposition in pastures or in animal houses, ubiquitous microorganisms in soil and waters transform urinary N components into ammonium (NH4 +), and thereafter into NO3 - and ultimately in N2 accompanied with the release of N2O. Urinary hippuric acid, creatine and creatinine decompose more slowly than urea. Hippuric acid may act as a natural inhibitor of N2O emissions, but inhibition conditions have not been defined properly yet. Environmental and soil conditions at the site of urine deposition or manure application strongly influence N2O release.

The experimental results showed that the highest reduction values were observed on CO emission by 42%, 30% and 8% for the D90E10, D70C20E10 and D80C20 fuels, respectively. These reductions for HC emission were achieved as 40%, 31% and 23% for the D90E10, D70C20E10 and D80C20, respectively. On the other hand, the reductions of NOx and CO2 emissions were not sharp and varied between 2\u20137%. Besides the reductions on the exhaust emissions, biodiesel\u2013ethanol blend presented better results in terms of HRRmax and CPmax than using biodiesel alone. Additionally, ignition delay of the biodiesel blends was longer than that of D100 fuel owing to their low cetane numbers. Combustion duration was shortened with the increment in engine speed because the turbulence increased in the combustion chamber at high engine speed. This case also improved the homogeneity of test fuels and increased the quality of the combustion process. As a consequence, this paper clearly reported that it is possible to achieve fewer emissions, the highest CPmax values with the presence of ethanol in biodiesel fuels rather than using\u00a0biodiesel alone for diesel engines.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "d2642a0633b55a6afc5e3aaa1d7708c26a6a3865", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1498631677", "CorpusId": 106670082}, "title": "Traffic Congestion and Greenhouse Gases", "abstract": "A comprehensive methodology has been developed to take advantage of the latest vehicle activity measurements and detailed vehicle emission factors to create an accurate emissions inventory for different types of vehicles and different levels of traffic congestion.

This is inevitable as much of the predicted climate changes over the next 30-40 years have already been predetermined by past and present emissions of GHGs. Change is likely to be significant. Understanding what the risks are likely to be and how best to adapt to them is therefore central to any mature climate change strategy.

Focusing on the consequences of climate change for the urban environment (where most of the population is concentrated and where its impact is likely to be most keenly felt), this paper suggests preferred adaptation options and provides an evaluation of how these may act to reinforce or hamper mitigation efforts. For example, moves towards urban densification may contribute to the reduction of energy use, yet will have negative implications for adaptation.

Here we assess the greenhouse gas emissions reductions associated with behavioural interventions in three high-emitting domains (personal vehicle use, meat consumption, and household energy use) based on an analysis of the peer-reviewed literature. We examined 40 studies from 1991-2018 involving 886 576 subjects. We found that some of the most robust interventions shown to reduce emissions were financial incentives for personal vehicles, defaults for reduced meat consumption, and feedback for home energy use. We estimate mean annual reductions of 571 kgCO2e per vehicle driver for reduced vehicle use, 51 kgCO2e per individual for reduced meat consumption, and 149 kgCO2e per household for reduced energy use. Despite substantial attention to behavioural interventions in the literature, we find that few studies are suitable for quantifying emissions reductions (N = 6 for diet, N = 5 for personal vehicles) and few (N = 3) are conducted outside OECD countries. Due to this imbalance in the literature, we focus our findings on western economies. We find substantial variation in the emission reductions achieved with different interventions within each domain; interventions in diet ranged from reductions of 231 kgCO2e to increases of 116 kgCO2e per person per year (both statistically significant). Further, emissions reductions are sensitive to external factors, such as the emissions intensity of the electrical grid, which may change over time. Key gaps in the literature include a lack of studies conducted using randomized controlled trials or follow-ups, and in high-impact areas for emissions reductions including air travel. We highlight promising areas of intervention, such as habit changes to promote mode shifts in personal transportation, which would benefit from an analysis of greenhouse gas emissions reductions in future research.

These proposals have the potential to include developing countries more actively in international greenhouse gas mitigation and to address a substantial share of the world's emissions which come from tropical deforestation. For such a policy to be viable it must have a credible benchmark against which emissions reduction can be calculated. This benchmark, sometimes termed a baseline or reference emissions scenario, can be based directly on historical emissions or can use historical emissions as input for business as usual projections. Here, we review existing data and methods that could be used to measure historical deforestation and forest degradation reference scenarios including FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations) national statistics and various remote sensing sources. The freely available and corrected global Landsat imagery for 1990, 2000 and soon to come for 2005 may be the best primary data source for most developing countries with other coarser resolution high frequency or radar data as a valuable complement for addressing problems with cloud cover and for distinguishing larger scale degradation. While sampling of imagery has been effectively useful for pan-tropical and continental estimates of deforestation, wall-to-wall (or full coverage) allows more detailed assessments for measuring national-level reference emissions. It is possible to measure historical deforestation with sufficient certainty for determining reference emissions, but there must be continued calls at the international level for making high-resolution imagery available, and for financial and technical assistance to help countries determine credible reference scenarios. The data available for past years may not be sufficient for assessing all forms of forest degradation, but new data sources will have greater potential in 2007 and after.

Source-receptor matrices, which quantify the transboundary transport between the European countries, are presented. The temporal evolution of exceedances of the critical loads have also been analysed. The present (1995) emission and deposition levels are also presented. The database utilized in this study is the one presently employed under the 1979 Geneva Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution. The emission data reported to EMEP indicate that the European sulphur emissions declined by approximately 50% during the period 1980\u20131995. Larger reductions were found in the area of the Former Soviet Union and western Europe than in central eastern Europe. For oxidized and reduced nitrogen the overall European reductions were approximately 15% from 1980 to 1995. Both oxidized and reduced nitrogen emissions fell more in eastern Europe than in western Europe. The corresponding declines in total deposition to all grid cells in the the EMEP domain have been calculated with a two-dimensional trajectory model for the period 1985\u20131995. The percent reductions were 34, 9 and 12% for sulphur, oxidized and reduced nitrogen, respectively. The deposition reductions are 5, 1 and 6% smaller than the emission reductions during this period for sulphur, oxidized and reduced nitrogen. We have further found that the total area affected by exceedances of acidifying sulphur and nitrogen was about 20% in the mid eighties, but it has dropped to approximately 10% in 1995. The area affected by exceedances of eutrophying nitrogen has, on the other hand, remained approximately at a little less than 30% throughout the whole period. The reductions in the total area of exceedance are consistent with the emission trends. The two-dimensional trajectory model has also been used to derive source-receptor matrices for the European countries for the period 1985\u20131995. The matrices clearly show that the atmospheric transport over distances of 1000\u20132000 km are very significant in particular for sulphur and oxidized nitrogen, and many countries in Europe receive most of the acidifying compounds from emissions in other countries.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "a8efeebcbf64f73c394c4d72d1ccd64216b242ff", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2315681472", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.5b00873", "CorpusId": 206545663, "PubMed": "25730303"}, "title": "Response of global particulate-matter-related mortality to changes in local precursor emissions.", "abstract": "Recent Global Burden of Disease (GBD) assessments estimated that outdoor fine-particulate matter (PM2.5) is a causal factor in over 5% of global premature deaths.

This study develops a proof-of-concept method to quantify the effects on global premature mortality of changes to PM2.5 precursor emissions. Using the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we calculated sensitivities of global PM2.5-related premature mortality to emissions of precursor gases (SO2, NOx, NH3) and carbonaceous aerosols. We used a satellite-derived ground-level PM2.5 data set at approximately 10 \u00d7 10 km(2) resolution to better align the exposure with population density. We used exposure-response functions from the GBD project to relate mortality to exposure in the adjoint calculation. The response of global mortality to changes in local anthropogenic emissions varied spatially by several orders of magnitude. The largest reductions in mortality for a 1 kg km(-2) yr(-1) decrease in emissions were for ammonia and carbonaceous aerosols in Eastern Europe.

The agreements reached at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change conference in Cancun in 2010 recognize that countries should take urgent action to limit the increase in global average temperature to less than 2 C relative to pre-industrial levels1. If this is to be achieved, policymakers need robust information about the amounts of future greenhouse-gas emissions that are consistent with such temperature limits. This, in turn, requires an understanding of both the technical and economic implications of reducing emissions and the processes that link emissions to temperature. Here we consider both of these aspects by reanalysing a large set of published emission scenarios from integrated assessment models in a risk-based climate modelling framework. We find that in the set of scenarios with a \u2018likely\u2019 (greater than 66%) chance of staying below 2 C, emissions peak between 2010 and 2020 and fall to a median level of 44 Gt of CO2 equivalent in 2020 (compared with estimated median emissions across the scenario set of 48 Gt of CO2 equivalent in 2010). Our analysis confirms that if the mechanisms needed to enable an early peak in global emissions followed by steep reductions are not put in place, there is a significant risk that the 2 C target will not be achieved. Cumulative emissions of long-lived greenhouse gases (GHGs) approximately define the temperature response of the climate system at timescales of centuries to millennia2\u20134 because a significant fraction of CO2 emissions, the dominant anthropogenic GHG, is removed very slowly from the atmosphere5,6. The temperature response will therefore continue, even when global emissions return to zero, or when concentrations are stabilized6,7. Cumulative emissions provide very little information on the technical feasibility and cost implications of following a particular \u2018emissions pathway\u2019, information that is needed for policymakers who are deciding now on emissions goals for the coming decades.

This perturbation to the nitrogen cycle has produced large increases of nitrogen deposition to sensitive ecosystems. Over recent decades, attention has focused on wet and dry deposition of nitrate stemming from fossil fuel combustion emissions of nitrogen oxides. Successful decreases in nitrogen oxides emissions in the United States have substantially decreased nitrate deposition. By contrast, emissions of ammonia, an unregulated air pollutant, and resulting deposition of ammonium have grown. Expanded observations demonstrate that deposition of reactive nitrogen in the United States has shifted from a nitrate-dominated to an ammonium-dominated condition. Recognition of this shift is critical to formulating effective future policies to protect ecosystems from excess nitrogen deposition. Rapid development of agriculture and fossil fuel combustion greatly increased US reactive nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere in the second half of the 20th century, resulting in excess nitrogen deposition to natural ecosystems. Recent efforts to lower nitrogen oxides emissions have substantially decreased nitrate wet deposition. Levels of wet ammonium deposition, by contrast, have increased in many regions. Together these changes have altered the balance between oxidized and reduced nitrogen deposition. Across most of the United States, wet deposition has transitioned from being nitrate-dominated in the 1980s to ammonium-dominated in recent years. Ammonia has historically not been routinely measured because there are no specific regulatory requirements for its measurement. Recent expansion in ammonia observations, however, along with ongoing measurements of nitric acid and fine particle ammonium and nitrate, permit new insight into the balance of oxidized and reduced nitrogen in the total (wet + dry) US nitrogen deposition budget. Observations from 37 sites reveal that reduced nitrogen contributes, on average, \u223c65% of the total inorganic nitrogen deposition budget. Dry deposition of ammonia plays an especially key role in nitrogen deposition, contributing from 19% to 65% in different regions.

Here we investigate how emission budgets are impacted by the inclusion of CO2 and CH4 emissions caused by permafrost thaw, a non-linear and tipping process of the Earth system. We use the compact Earth system model OSCAR v2.2.1, in which parameterizations of permafrost thaw, soil organic matter decomposition and CO2 and CH4 emission were introduced based on four complex land surface models that specifically represent high-latitude processes. We found that permafrost carbon release makes emission budgets path dependent (that is, budgets also depend on the pathway followed to reach the target). The median remaining budget for the 2\u2009\u00b0C target reduces by 8% (1\u201325%) if the target is avoided and net negative emissions prove feasible, by 13% (2\u201334%) if they do not prove feasible, by 16% (3\u201344%) if the target is overshot by 0.5\u2009\u00b0C and by 25% (5\u201363%) if it is overshot by 1\u2009\u00b0C.
