For this, scenarios of nine models are compared in terms of sectoral and regional CH4 emission reduction strategies, as well as resulting climate impacts. The models\u2019 projected reduction potentials are compared to sector and technology-specific reduction potentials found in literature. Significant cost-effective and non-climate policy related reductions are projected in the reference case (10\u201336% compared to a \u201cfrozen emission factor\u201d scenario in 2100). Still, compared to 2010, CH4 emissions are expected to rise steadily by 9\u201372% (up to 412 to 654 Mt CH4/year). Ambitious CO2 reduction measures could by themselves lead to a reduction of CH4 emissions due to a reduction of fossil fuels (22\u201348% compared to the reference case in 2100). However, direct CH4 mitigation is crucial and more effective in bringing down CH4 (50\u201374% compared to the reference case). Given the limited reduction potential, agriculture CH4 emissions are projected to constitute an increasingly larger share of total anthropogenic CH4 emissions in mitigation scenarios. Enteric fermentation in ruminants is in that respect by far the largest mitigation bottleneck later in the century with a projected 40\u201378% of total remaining CH4 emissions in 2100 in a strong (2\u00a0\u00b0C) climate policy case.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "9fbbd4582c25ac606e9bb441d5fddc5e5c0229ae", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2075128104", "DOI": "10.1029/2005GL022949", "CorpusId": 128431398}, "title": "Ebullition of methane from peat with falling atmospheric pressure", "abstract": "Recent works on CH4 emissions from peatlands have demonstrated that ebullition can be a more important emission pathway than it has been thought.

Owing to their large-scale use, production of cement and concrete results in substantial emission of greenhouse gases and places strain on the availability of natural resources, such as water. Projected urbanization over the next 50\u2013100 years therefore indicates that the demand for cement and concrete will continue to increase, necessitating strategies to limit their environmental impact. In this Review, we shed light on the available solutions that can be implemented within the next decade and beyond to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cement and concrete production. As the construction sector has proven to be very slow-moving and risk-averse, we focus on minor improvements that can be achieved across the value chain, such as the use of supplementary cementitious materials and optimizing the clinker content of cement. Critically, the combined effect of these marginal gains can have an important impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by up to 50% if all stakeholders are engaged. In doing so, we reveal credible pathways for sustainable concrete use that balance societal needs, environmental requirements and technical feasibility. Concrete is one of the most widely used man-made materials and is critical for the ongoing urbanization of the global population. However, owing to its widespread use, concrete can have a negative impact on the environment. This Review provides medium-term and long-term solutions to address the environmental concerns surrounding concrete production. Large-scale replacement of cement by other materials is not possible within the next decade. The environmental impact of cement and concrete production is low per unit volume of material, but the amounts used make the impact of the concrete sector highly important. Reductions in CO2 emissions are possible through the introduction of improvements across the cement and concrete value chain. By engaging all stakeholders in the construction sector, immediate greenhouse gas savings on the order of 50% could be reached without heavy investment in new industrial infrastructure or modification of existing standards.

Nitrogen fertilizer positively affects corn yield and the soil organic carbon level, but it also has negative environmental effects through nitrogen-related emissions from soil (e.g., N20, NOx, NO3(-) leaching, etc.). Effects of nitrogen fertilizer on greenhouse gas emissions associated with corn grain are investigated via life cycle assessment. Ecoefficiency analysis is also used to determine an economically and environmentally optimal nitrogen application rate (NAR). The ecoefficiency index in this study is defined as the ratio of economic return due to nitrogen fertilizer to the greenhouse gas emissions of corn cultivation. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with corn grain decrease as NAR increases at a lower NAR until a minimum greenhouse gas emission level is reached because corn yield and soil organic carbon level increase with NAR. Further increasing NAR after a minimum greenhouse gas emission level raises greenhouse gas emissions associated with corn grain. Increased greenhouse gas emissions of corn grain due to nitrous oxide emissions from soil are much higher than reductions of greenhouse gas emissions of corn grain due to corn yield and changes in soil organic carbon levels at a higher NAR. Thus, there exists an environmentally optimal NAR in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. The trends of the ecoefficiency index are similar to those of economic return to nitrogen and greenhouse gas emissions associated with corn grain. Therefore, an appropriate NAR could enhance profitability as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with corn grain.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "560ff6d85cc1d4e1319aaf52ac63bd225238a04b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2894633064", "DOI": "10.1038/s41929-018-0139-9", "CorpusId": 104932490}, "title": "Improved CO2 reduction activity towards C2+ alcohols on a tandem gold on copper electrocatalyst", "abstract": "The discovery of materials for the electrochemical transformation of carbon dioxide into liquid fuels has the potential to impact large-scale storage of renewable energies and reduce carbon emissions. Here, we report the discovery of an electrocatalyst composed of gold nanoparticles on a polycrystalline copper foil (Au/Cu) that is highly active for CO2 reduction to alcohols. At low overpotentials, the Au/Cu electrocatalyst is over 100 times more selective for the formation of products containing C\u2013C bonds versus methane or methanol, largely favouring the generation of alcohols over hydrocarbons. A combination of electrochemical testing and transport modelling supports the hypothesis that CO2 reduction on gold generates a high CO concentration on nearby copper, where CO is further reduced to alcohols such as ethanol and n-propanol under locally alkaline conditions. The bimetallic Au/Cu electrocatalyst exhibits synergistic activity and selectivity superior to gold, copper or AuCu alloys, and opens new possibilities for the development of CO2 reduction electrodes exploiting tandem catalysis mechanisms.The electrochemical transformation of CO2 into liquid fuels is a major challenge.

Here, this paper discusses the dynamic relationship of industrial structure upgrading, economic growth, and carbon emission reduction. Results show that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship among industrial structure upgrading, economic growth, and carbon emissions.

Industrial structure upgrading and economic growth have a negative impact on carbon emissions, thereby promoting emission reduction. And at the 10% significance level, there is a one-way Granger causality from carbon emissions to industrial structure upgrading, economic growth can cause one-way changes in carbon emissions, and industrial structure upgrading is a one-way Granger cause of economic growth.

Across all models, carbon prices lead to significant reductions in CO2 emissions and conventional pollutants, with the vast majority of the reductions occurring in the electricity sector. Importantly, emissions reductions do not significantly depend on the rebate or tax cut used to return revenues to the economy. Expected economic costs, as modeled by either GDP or welfare, are modest, but vary across models. These costs are offset by benefits from avoided climate damages and health benefits from reductions in conventional air pollution. Using revenues to reduce preexisting capital or labor taxes reduces costs in most models relative to lump-sum rebates, but the size of the cost reductions varies significantly. Devoting at least some revenue to household rebates can significantly reduce adverse impacts on low income households.

If they were introduced, carbon taxes would affect the price of fossil fuels in the UK, and thus UK consumer prices, both directly for fuels and indirectly for manufactured goods. These price changes would in turn affect the level and structure of UK final demand, and it is this post-tax UK final demand which will determine UK fossil fuel use, and thus CO2 emissions.

To determine the effectiveness of policies aimed at the reduction of emission of ammonia (NH3), N2O and NOx, nitrate (NO3) leaching and nitrogen (N) runoff, it is essential to have information on the fate of nitrogen in both agricultural and non-agricultural soils on a regional and national scale and its inherent uncertainties. In this paper, we quantified the uncertainties in the emission, uptake, accumulation, denitrification, leaching and runoff of nitrogen at a national scale and for specific land use\u2013soil type combinations. Furthermore, we identified which parameters contribute most to the overall uncertainty in the emission of ammonia to the atmosphere and the leaching/runoff to groundwater and surface water. To gain quantitative insight into the propagation of the uncertainty, a model was developed representing all crucial processes in the N chain by simple process descriptions. Uncertainties were quantified for the Netherlands as a whole, including terrestrial systems, both agricultural and non-agricultural land, and aquatic systems. For agricultural and non-agricultural land, plots were distinguished, consisting of a multiple of 500 \u00d7 500 m2 and of 250 \u00d7 250 m2 grid cells, respectively, with unique combinations of soil use, soil type and groundwater table class that were derived from existing digital maps. Model parameters were assigned by using relationships with soil type, groundwater level class and land use. The uncertainty was quantified by means of a Monte Carlo analysis, whereas statistical approaches were used to identify which parameters contribute most to the overall uncertainty of the fate of nitrogen. The 90% confidence interval for the fluxes of N compounds to air, groundwater and surface water (in Gg N.yr\u22121) ranged between 102 and 194 for ammonia emission, between 18 and 51 for N2O emissions, between 32 and 108 for NO3 inflow to groundwater and between 2 and 38 for N inflow to surface water. The uncertainty in NH3 emission was mainly caused by the uncertainty in the NH3 emission fractions for animal manure, whereas the uncertainty in N2O emission was mainly due to the uncertainty in the fractions relating total nitrification and denitrification to N2O emissions. The uncertainty in inflow to groundwater and runoff to surface water was mainly caused by the uncertainty in denitrification in the soil and in upper groundwater and in non-agricultural soils also by the N accumulation in the soil.

However, the impacts of forest degradation are understudied and poorly understood, largely because international emission reduction programs have focused on deforestation, which is easier to detect and thus more readily monitored. To better understand and seize opportunities for addressing climate change it will be essential to improve knowledge of greenhouse gas emissions from forest degradation.ResultsHere we provide a consistent estimation of forest degradation emissions between 2005 and 2010 across 74 developing countries covering 2.2 billion hectares of forests. We estimated annual emissions of 2.1 billion tons of carbon dioxide, of which 53% were derived from timber harvest, 30% from woodfuel harvest and 17% from forest fire. These percentages differed by region: timber harvest was as high as 69% in South and Central America and just 31% in Africa; woodfuel harvest was 35% in Asia, and just 10% in South and Central America; and fire ranged from 33% in Africa to only 5% in Asia. Of the total emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, forest degradation accounted for 25%. In 28 of the 74 countries, emissions from forest degradation exceeded those from deforestation.ConclusionsThe results of this study clearly demonstrate the importance of accounting greenhouse gases from forest degradation by human activities. The scale of emissions presented indicates that the exclusion of forest degradation from national and international GHG accounting is distorting.

This study addresses the issue of carbon embodiments in trade using internationally-comparable OECD data sources (Input-Output, Bilateral Goods Trade and CO2 emissions) for 41 countries/regions by 17 industries. Simulation results under base case scenarios for the mid-1990s and the early 2000s suggest that \u201ctrade deficits\u201d of CO2 emissions are observed in 21 OECD countries in the early 2000s and that for 16 countries, the magnitude of the trade deficit increased in the late 1990s. While a third (860 Mt CO2) of the global increase in production-based emissions took place within the non-OECD economies in the late 1990s, more than half of the consumption-based emission (1550 Mt CO2) is still attributable to OECD consumption. The sensitivity simulations imply that an increase in global trade intensity has an increasing impact on embodied emissions while technology transfers from carbon-intensive countries to high carbon-intensive countries reduce global emissions and carbon trade gaps.

Synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A is an essential vesicle membrane protein expressed in virtually all synapses and could serve as a suitable target for synaptic density. Objective To compare hippocampal synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) binding in participants with AD and cognitively normal participants using positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study recruited 10 participants with AD and 11 participants who were cognitively normal between November 2015 and June 2017. We hypothesized a reduction in hippocampal SV2A binding in AD, based on the early degeneration of entorhinal cortical cell projections to the hippocampus (via the perforant path) and hippocampal SV2A reductions that had been observed in postmortem studies. Participants underwent high-resolution PET scanning with ((R)-1-((3-(11C-methyl-11C)pyridin-4-yl)methyl)-4-(3,4,5-trifluorophenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one), a compound more commonly known as 11C-UCB-J, for SV2A.

Main Outcomes and Measures Outcomes were 11C-UCB-J\u2013specific binding (binding potential [BPND]) via PET imaging in brain regions of interest in participants with AD and participants who were cognitively normal. Results Ten participants with AD (5 male and 5 female; mean [SD] age, 72.7 [6.3] years; 10 [100%] &bgr;-amyloid positive) were compared with 11 participants who were cognitively normal (5 male and 6 female; mean [SD] age, 72.9 [8.7] years; 11 [100%] &bgr;-amyloid negative). Participants with AD spanned the disease stages from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (n\u2009=\u20095) to mild dementia (n\u2009=\u20095). Participants with AD had significant reduction in hippocampal SV2A specific binding (41%) compared with cognitively normal participants, as assessed by 11C-UCB-J\u2013PET BPND (cognitively normal participants: mean [SD] BPND, 1.47 [0.37]; participants with AD: 0.87 [0.50]; P\u2009=\u2009.005). These reductions remained significant after correction for atrophy (ie, partial volume correction; participants who were cognitively normal: mean [SD], 2.71 [0.46]; participants with AD: 2.15 [0.55]; P\u2009=\u2009.02). Hippocampal SV2A-specific binding BPND was correlated with a composite episodic memory score in the overall sample (R\u2009=\u20090.56; P\u2009=\u2009.01). Conclusions and Relevance To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate synaptic density in vivo in AD using 11C-UCB-J\u2013PET imaging.

With this extension, the RAINS model allows now the assessment of emission control costs for the six greenhouse gases covered under the Kyoto Protocol (CO2, CH4, N2O and the three F-gases) together with the emissions of air pollutants SO2, NOX, VOC, NH3 AND PM. \n \nIn the first phase of the study, emissions, costs and control potentials for the six greenhouse gases covered in the Kyoto Protocol have been estimated and implemented in the RAINS model. Emission estimates are based on methodologies and emission factors proposed by the IPCC emission reporting guidelines.

The net cost of greenhouse gas control strategies are significantly lower if the immediate cost-savings from avoided air pollution control costs are taken into consideration.

Volatile Organic Compound Speciation and Reactivity", "abstract": "This paper addresses the impact of California phase 2 reformulated gasoline (RFG) on the composition and reactivity of motor vehicle exhaust and evaporative emissions. Significant changes to gasoline properties that occurred in the first half of 1996 included an increase in oxygen content; decreases in alkene, aromatic, benzene, and sulfur contents; and modified distillation properties. Vehicle emissions were measured in a San Francisco Bay Area roadway tunnel in summers 1994-1997; gasoline samples were collected from local service stations in summers 1995 and 1996. Equilibrium gasoline headspace vapor composition was calculated from measured liquid gasoline composition. Addition of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and reduction of alkenes and aromatics in gasoline between summers 1995 and 1996 led to corresponding changes in the composition of gasoline headspace vapors. Normalized reactivity of liquid gasoline and headspace vapors decreased by 23 and 19%, respectively. Ozone formation should be reduced because of both lower gasoline vapor pressure, which leads to lower mass emissions, and reduced reactivity of gasoline vapors. The reactivity of onroad emissions measured in the tunnel decreased by 8% or less. The reduction in reactivity of on-road emissions was less than that of evaporative emissions because of increased weight fractions of highly-reactive isobutene and formaldehyde in vehicle exhaust, which resulted from the increased use of MTBE in gasoline. On-road vehicle emissions of volatile organic compounds in the tunnel appear to be dominated by vehicles that have reduced catalytic converter activity.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "1381a3484c1ec282d3dac37cc0275053bb7fdb6f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "301977330", "DOI": "10.1007/s40825-015-0018-7", "CorpusId": 14442648}, "title": "Emission Reduction with Diesel Particle Filter with SCR Coating (SDPF)", "abstract": "AbstractThe present paper informs about some results obtained with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and with SDPF (a diesel particle filter (DPF) with SCR coating) on a medium duty research engine Iveco F1C. This work is a first attempt at evaluating the effects of a SDPF on non-legislated gaseous emissions and on secondary nanoparticles. Beside the limited gaseous emission components, NH3, NO2, and N2O were measured with FTIR, and the analysis of nanoparticle emissions was performed with Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) and condensation particle counter (CPC). The integration of functions of filtration and NOx reduction in one element of exhaust aftertreatment system offers several advantages and is widely investigated and considered as a market solution. The most important technical statements of the research are as follows:The emission behavior of SDPF after urea switch-on (SWON) concerning NOx reduction speed and NH3 peak is always fluctuating even in identical test procedures and with careful conducted conditionings.The loaded SDPF, compared with empty one, shows slower NOx reduction and higher NH3 after SWON because of use of part of NO2 for soot oxidation and consequently less NO2 availability for the deNOx reactions; the secondary nanoparticle (NP) penetration after SWON is clearly lower with the loaded trap.Both investigated systems, SDPF and 2\u00d7 SCR, attain nearly the same deNOx efficiency.In worldwide heavy duty transient cycle (WHTC) with a lower level of exhaust gas temperature, SDPF causes lower deNOx values (40\u201345 against 75\u00a0% in European transient cycle (ETC)), but also lower NH3 emissions.\n Further developments of those aftertreatment systems, concerning substrates, coatings, and reduction agent control, open further potentials of improvements.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "e880011055cbf412c367dfd9a3a42ef1b7b5a1b1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1976899479", "DOI": "10.1038/326143A0", "CorpusId": 4334338}, "title": "Late Cretaceous and paroxysmal Cretaceous/Tertiary extinctions", "abstract": "The various geological signatures at Cretaceous/ Tertiary time including iridium and other associated elements, microspherules, and shock deformation features are compatible with the suggestion that the transition is marked by a period of intense volcanism.

We try to reconcile the observed CO trend with emission inventories using an atmospheric inversion of the MOPITT CO data that estimates emissions from primary sources, secondary production, and chemical sinks of CO. The atmospheric inversion indicates a ~ \u22122% yr\u22121 decrease in emissions from primary sources in East Asia from 2005\u20132016. The decreasing emissions are mainly caused by source reductions in China. The regional MEIC inventory for China is the only bottom up estimate consistent with the inversion-diagnosed decrease of CO emissions. According to the MEIC data, decreasing CO emissions from four main sectors (iron and steel industries, residential sources, gasoline-powered vehicles, and construction materials industries) in China explain 76% of the inversion-based trend of East Asian CO emissions.

Additionally, as dairying generates both milk and meat, this study assessed several methods of allocating emissions between these coproducts. An LCA was carried out for a simulated farm based on a typical nongrazing dairy production system in Quebec. The LCA was conducted over 6 yr, the typical lifespan of dairy cows in this province. The assessment considered 65 female Holstein calves, of which 60 heifers survived to first calving at 27 mo of age. These animals were subsequently retained for an average of 2.75 lactations. Progeny were also included in the analysis, with bulls and heifers in excess of replacement requirements finished as grain-fed veal (270 kg) at 6.5 mo of age. All cattle were housed indoors and fed forages and grains produced on the same farm. Pre-farm gate GHG emissions and removals were quantified using Holos, a whole-farm software model developed by Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and based on the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change Tier 2 and 3methodologies with modifications for Canadian conditions. The LCA yielded a GHG intensity of 0.92 kg of CO(2) Eq/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk yield. Methane (CH(4)) accounted for 56% of total emissions, with 86% originating from enteric fermentation. Nitrous oxide accounted for 40% of total GHG emissions. Lactating cows contributed 64% of total GHG emissions, whereas calves under 12 mo contributed 10% and veal calves only 3%. Allocation of GHG emissions between meat and milk were assessed as (1) 100% allocation to milk, (2) economics, (3) dairy versus veal animals, and (4) International Dairy Federation equation using feed energy demand for meat and milk production. Comparing emissions from dairy versus veal calves resulted in 97% of the emissions allocated to milk. The lowest allocation of emissions to milk (78%) was associated with the International Dairy Federation equation. This LCA showed that greatest reductions in GHG emissions would be achieved by applying mitigation strategies to reduce enteric CH(4) from the lactating cow, with minimal reductions being achievable in young stock.

In continuous culture, the nitrifier Nitrosomonas europaea and the denitrifiers Alcaligenes eutrophus and Pseudomonas stutzeri were cultured at different levels of aeration (80 to 0% air saturation) and subjected to changes in aeration.

Coculturing of N. europaea with the nitrite oxidizer Nitrobacter winogradskyi strongly reduced the relative levels of NO and N(inf2)O production, probably as an effect of the lowered nitrite concentration.

Quantification of emission changes is a prerequisite for the assessment of\ncontrol effectiveness in improving air quality. However, the traditional\nbottom-up method for characterizing emissions requires detailed\ninvestigation of emissions data (e.g., activity and other emission\nparameters) that usually takes months to perform and limits timely\nassessments. Here we propose a novel method to address this issue by using a\nresponse model that provides real-time estimation of emission changes based\non air quality observations in combination with emission-concentration\nresponse functions derived from chemical transport modeling. We applied the\nnew method to quantify the emission changes on the North China Plain (NCP)\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown, which overlapped the Spring Festival (also known as Chinese New Year)\nholiday. Results suggest that the anthropogenic emissions of NO2 ,\n SO2 , volatile organic compound (VOC) and primary PM 2.5 on the NCP were reduced by 51\u2009%, 28\u2009%,\n67\u2009% and 63\u2009%, respectively, due to the COVID-19 shutdown, indicating\nlonger and stronger shutdown effects in 2020 compared to the previous Spring\nFestival holiday. The reductions of VOC and primary PM 2.5 emissions are\ngenerally effective in reducing O3 and PM 2.5 concentrations.\nHowever, such air quality improvements are largely offset by reductions in\n NOx emissions. NOx emission reductions lead to increases in\n O3 and PM 2.5 concentrations on the NCP due to the strongly VOC-limited\nconditions in winter. A strong NH3 -rich condition is also suggested\nfrom the air quality response to the substantial NOx emission\nreduction. Well-designed control strategies are recommended based on the air\nquality response associated with the unexpected emission changes during the\nCOVID-19 period.

The three experimental sites covered different ecosystems of wetland rice--irrigated, rainfed, and deepwater rice--using only mineral fertilizers (for this comparison). In Jakenan (Indonesia), the local water regime in rainfed rice encompassed a gradual increase (wet season) and a gradual decrease (dry season) in floodwater levels. Emission rates accumulated to 52 and 91 kg CH4 ha\u22121 season\u22121 corresponding to approximately 40% of emissions from irrigated rice in each season. Distinct drainage periods within the season can drastically reduce CH4 emissions to less than 30 kg CH4 ha\u22121 season\u22121 as shown in Los Ba\u00f1os (Philippines). The reduction effect of this water regime as compared with irrigated rice varied from 20% to 80% from season to season. Methane fluxes from deepwater rice in Prachinburi (Thailand) were lower than from irrigated rice but accumulated to equally high seasonal values, i.e., about 99 kg CH4 ha\u22121 season\u22121, due to longer seasons and assured periods of flooding. Rice ecosystems with continuous flooding were characterized by anaerobic conditions in the soil. These conditions commonly found in irrigated and deepwater rice favored CH4 emissions. Temporary aeration of flooded rice soils, which is generic in rainfed rice, reduced emission rates due to low CH4 production and high CH4 oxidation. Based on these findings and the global distribution of rice area, irrigated rice accounts globally for 70\u201380% of CH4 from the global rice area.

This potential increases with rising temperatures and may lead to severe problems with air quality in densely populated areas during heat waves. Here, we investigate how heat waves affect emissions of volatile organic compounds from urban/suburban vegetation and corresponding ground-level ozone and particulate matter. We use the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with atmospheric chemistry (WRF-Chem) with emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from vegetation simulated with MEGAN to quantify some of these feedbacks in Berlin, Germany, during the heat wave in 2006. The highest ozone concentration observed during that period was \u223c200 \u03bcg/m3 (\u223c101 ppbV).

The actual contribution is expected to be even higher as the model underestimates isoprene concentrations over urban forests and parks by 0.6-1.4 ppbv.

Whereas reductions in NOx (oxide of nitrogen) emissions have decreased nitrate and PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u22642.5 \u03bcm) concentrations in the Basin during the past decade, ozone levels have increased at the central basin locations since about 2005 following a reversal in the decline of volatile organic compound (VOC)/NOx ratios during the previous two decades. A chemical box model was used to simulate the effects of changes in precursor concentrations on ozone formation using day-of-week\u2013specific initial precursor concentrations that were derived from measurements and projected to 2020 based on expected emission reductions from 2005 (\u221210% VOC and\u2009\u221250% NOx). Results show that peak ozone formation rates in 2020 will increase on weekdays by a factor of 3 relative to 2005 and will be comparable to 1995 weekday and 2005 Sunday rates. Ozone production will become precursor limited on Sundays in 2020, but with higher initial rates than 2005. Although a greater NOx reduction scenario in 2020 of\u2009\u221275% will result in even higher initial ozone formation rates, precursor limitation is reached quickly, leading to a further shift westward in the location of peak ozone levels. However, ozone levels will likely be lower in downwind areas where transport is more important than local production of ozone. The ambient versus emission inventory reconciliation indicates a factor of 2 underestimation of VOC emissions in 2009 relative to NOx. Other analyses suggest that there is an overall increase in VOC emissions on hot days that is not fully accounted for by emission inventory estimates. Air quality models using emission inventories that underestimate VOC emissions relative to NOx may lead to inaccurate forecasting of the consequence of emission reductions. Implications: The rate and efficiency of ozone formation and accumulation in the SoCAB is more rapid than would be indicated by air quality model simulations based on the current inventory. Projected reductions in NOx emissions without concurrent reductions in VOC emissions will likely cause ozone to increase during the next decade within central regions of the SoCAB compared with a flat or slightly declining trend in far downwind locations.

However, estimating the reduction potential by life cycle assessment using coke oven and blast furnace in steel works has been a challenging task due to the complex structure of energy flow in steel works. Municipal waste plastics consist of several plastic resins. Previous studies have generally disregarded the composition of waste plastics, which varies significantly depending on the geographical area. If the reduction potentials by using each plastic resin in steel works can be quantified, the potential of municipal waste plastics (mixtures of plastic resins) can be estimated by summing up the potential of each resin multiplied by the composition of each resin in municipal waste plastics. Therefore, the goal of this study is to investigate the reduction potentials of CO2 emissions by using individual plastic resins (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET)) and those for municipal waste plastics in the coke oven and blast furnace.Materials and methodsA model was developed to clarify the energy flow in steel works. In order to estimate the changes in energy and material balance in coke ovens when waste plastics are charged, the equations to calculate the coke product yield, gas product yield, and oil product yields of each plastic resin were derived from previous studies. The Rist model was adopted to quantify the changes in the inputs and outputs when plastics were fed into a blast furnace. Then, a matrix calculation method was used to calculate the change in energy balance before and after plastics are fed into a coke oven.ResultsIt was confirmed that product yields of municipal waste plastics (mixtures of plastic resins) could be estimated by summing up the product yield of each plastic resin multiplied by the composition of each resin in municipal waste plastics. In both cases of coke oven and blast furnace feedstock recycling, the reduction potential of CO2 emissions varies significantly depending on the plastic resins. For example, in the case of coke oven chemical feedstock recycling, the reduction potential of PS and PP is larger than that of PE. On the other hand, in the case of blast furnace feedstock recycling, PE has the largest CO2 emissions reduction potential, whereas the CO2 emission reduction potential of PP is smaller than those of PE and PS. In both cases, PET has negative CO2 emission reduction potentials, i.e., there is an increase of CO2 emissions. In addition, the reduction potentials of CO2 emissions are slightly different in each city.DiscussionsThe differences in the reduction potentials of CO2 emissions by coke oven chemical feedstock recycling of each plastic resin is attributable to the differences in calorific values and coke product yields of each plastic resin. On the other hand, the difference in the CO2 emission reduction potential for each plastic resin in blast furnace feedstock recycling is attributable to the difference in calorific values and the carbon and hydrogen content of each plastic resin, which leads to a difference in the coke substitution effect by each plastic resin. In both cases, the difference in those of municipal waste plastics is mostly attributable to the amount of impurities (e.g., ash, water) in the municipal waste plastics.ConclusionsIt was found that the reduction potential of CO2 emissions by coke oven and blast furnace feedstock recycling of municipal waste plastics (mixtures of plastic resins) could be estimated by summing up the potential of each resin multiplied by the composition of each resin in municipal waste plastics. It was also clarified that feedstock recycling of waste plastic in steel works is effective for avoiding the increase in CO2 emissions by incinerating waste plastics, such as those from household mixtures of different resins.Recommendations and perspectivesWith the results obtained in this study, reduction potentials of CO2 emissions can be calculated for any waste plastics because differences in composition are taken into account.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "0f9d5165a01f665d70be64833c4475972831f474", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2226995137", "DOI": "10.4271/2000-01-0182", "CorpusId": 138435164}, "title": "Opportunity for Diesel Emission Reductions Using AdvancedCatalysts and Water Blend Fuel", "abstract": "This paper features the results of emission tests conducted on diesel oxidation catalysts, and the combination of diesel oxidation catalysts and water blend fuel (diesel fuel continuous emulsion).

In addition to the measures listed above, other benefits of compost application may have some relevance. Some of these measures include replacement of chemical fertilizers (implying avoidance of greenhouse gases related to their production) reduced use of pesticides (avoiding emissions associated with their production), improved tilth and workability (less consumption of fuels).

When SO2 emission factors in every unit of steel production are presumed to remain constant through 2030, scenario analysis results show that under a business\u2010as\u2010usual (BAU) scenario SO2 emissions will experience sustained growth to a peak value of 1.73 million metric tons (megatons, Mt) through 2020, approximately 52% higher than that in 2006, and that this trend is unlikely to be reversed. The high scenario and medium scenario demonstrate that it is difficult to control SO2 emissions to an acceptable level by only upgrading technology and making industrial structural adjustments. Yet through the incorporation of sintering gas desulfurization, the low scenario can smoothly bridge the gap between the simulative SO2 emissions and the envisioned value, since sintering is the biggest emitter in this industry. Once the desulfurization rate of sintering gas reaches 60%, SO2 emissions will be less than the level of 0.60 Mt in 2030 and will also meet the reduction goals.

The uniformity of temperature in the furnace was found to be far greater with low oxygen concentration combustion air preheated to 1000\u00b0C as compared to that obtained with roomtemperature air or that found in conventional flames. Emission of NO x and CO was much lower with combustion air preheated to high temperatures with low oxygen concentration.

Within this degrowth approach, working time reduction is a key policy lever to reduce emissions as well as protect employment. In the United States, the abdication of responsibility for mitigation by the federal government has led to the emergence of state climate leadership. This study is the first to analyze the relationship between emissions and working hours at the state level. Our findings suggest that over the 2007\u20132013 period, state-level carbon emissions and average working hours have a strong, positive relationship, which holds across a variety of model estimation techniques and net of various political, economic, and demographic drivers of emissions. We conclude that working time reduction may represent a multiple dividend policy, contributing to enhanced quality of life and lower unemployment as well as emissions mitigation.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "46253e6cd10c202e1234e44157998697dc0e813e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2951987597", "DOI": "10.1021/JA9842262", "CorpusId": 197014290}, "title": "Superior Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst for selective catalytic reduction of nitric oxide by ammonia", "abstract": "Nitrogen oxides in the exhaust gases from combustion of fossil fuels remain a major source for air pollution and acid rain. The current technology for reducing NO{sub x} (NO + NO{sub 2}) emissions from power plants is selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with ammonia in the presence of oxygen. For the SCR reaction, V{sub 2}O{sub 5} + WO{sub 3} (or MoO{sub 3}) supported on TiO{sub 2} are the commercial catalysts. The mechanism of the reaction on the vanadia catalysts has been studied extensively, and several different mechanisms have been proposed. Ion-exchanged zeolite catalysts have also been studied, e.g., Fe-Y, Cu-ZSM-5, and Fe-ZSM-5, but the reported activities were lower than that of the commercial vanadia catalysts. The SCR technology based on vanadia catalysts is being used in Europe and Japan and is being quickly adopted in the US. However, problems associated with vanadia catalysts remain, e.g., high activity for oxidation of SO{sub 2} to SO{sub 3}, toxicity of vanadia, and formation of N{sub 2}O at high temperature. Hence, there are continuing efforts in developing new catalysts. In this paper, the authors report a superior Fe-ZSM-5 catalyst that is much more active than the commercial vanadia catalysts and does not have the deficienciesmore\u00a0\u00bb that are associated with the vanadia catalysts.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "3de83ee2f4ca51425f94fcd44d170456acb3731f", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.33584/jnzg.2002.64.2462", "CorpusId": 37520924}, "title": "Methanogenesis from forages fed to sheep", "abstract": "Methane production has been measured from lambs fed contrasting forages. This work has been driven by the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture and to determine energy losses to methane from contrasting diets. Young ram lambs were fed either fresh ryegrass/white clover pasture, lucerne (also pelleted lucerne), sulla, chicory, red clover, Lotus pedunculatus (lotus) and mixtures of sulla and lucerne, sulla and chicory and chicory with red clover. The effects of condensed tannin (CT) in lotus on methane production were also measured. The trials were carried out indoors with sheep held in metabolism crates to enable an accurate measurement of intake and digestibility as well as methane production. Principal findings were a two-fold range in emissions from 11.5g CH 4 /kg dry matter intake (DMI) with lotus to 25.7g CH 4 /kg DMI with pasture and a 16% reduction in methane production due to the CT in lotus. This range in emissions from good quality forages represents a loss of about 7-11% of metabolisable energy and presents a clear direction for future research to better utilise the feeding value of pastures and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture. High quality perennial forages should be used where practical, and researchers need to identify plant parameters responsible for the variation in methane emissions. Research must focus on rapid passage of digesta through the rumen of grazing animals and will involve manipulation of the fibre content of grasses. Introduction of CT into diets is a likely target to reduce methane production. Improving the rapidly digestible constituents of forages is another opportunity, but difficult to target.", "year": 2002}]}
