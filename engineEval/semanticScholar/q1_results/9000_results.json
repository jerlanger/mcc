The presence of a high concentration of toxic organic compounds in industrial wastewaters always presents significant problems. Therefore, this study was undertaken by using wastewater with COD of 9600 mg/L and total petroleum hydrocarbons-gasoline 440 mg/L for making an emulsified oil (wastewater content 20% with 0.1% surfactant) to evaluate the extent of reductions in both criteria pollutants and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For comparison, two other systems (heavy oil fuel and water-emulsified oil) were also conducted. The wastewater-emulsified oil fuel results in significant reductions in particulate matter (PM), NO(x), SO2, and CO as compared to heavy oil fuel and similar to those from water/oil emulsified fuel; for PM, it is better in wastewater-emulsified oil. The reductions of total PAH flue gas emissions are 38 and 30% for wastewater- and water-emulsified fuel, respectively; they are 63 and 44% for total BaP(eq), respectively. In addition to reducing flue gas pollutant emissions, the results also demonstrate that the use of wastewater-emulsified fuel in boiler operation provides several advantages: (1) safe disposal of industrial wastewater; and (2) energy savings of about 13%.

The United States will fall far short of its goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the year 2000 to 1990 levels, as agreed to in the 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC), and it led the opposition, until recently, to binding commitments for reducing emissions.

Mitigation strategies need to consider the management/feeding systems used to ensure that these strategies will be readily accepted and adopted by farmers. Housed systems allow diets to be formulated in ways that may reduce GHG production, but the challenge is much greater for systems where animals graze outdoors for long periods. A methane mitigation option in the form of fresh forage would be desirable in livestock production systems with high reliance on grazing.

The variation in methane emissions measured between feeds, individual animals and experiment is large, even in controlled conditions, and the dynamic nature of sward-animal interactions will only exacerbate this variation, creating challenges beyond the identification of mitigants. Furthermore, implementation of knowledge gained from controlled studies requires validation under grazing systems to identify any trade-offs between methane reduction and animal productivity or emission of other pollutants.

In this study, we conducted numerical experiments with an up-todate regional chemical transport model to assess the contribution of the changes in meteorological conditions and anthropogenic emissions to the summer ozone level from 2013 to 2017 in various regions of China. The model can faithfully reproduce the observed meteorological parameters and air pollutant concentrations and capture the increasing trend in the surface maximum daily 8 h average (MDA8) ozone (O3) from 2013 to 2017. The emission-control measures implemented by the government induced a decrease in MDA8 O3 levels in rural areas but an increase in urban areas. The meteorological influence on the ozone trend varied by region and by year and could be comparable to or even more significant than the impact of changes in anthropogenic emissions. Meteorological conditions can modulate the ozone concentration via direct (e.g., increasing reaction rates at higher temperatures) and indirect (e.g., increasing biogenic emissions at higher temperatures) effects. As an essential source of volatile organic compounds that contributes to ozone formation, the variation in biogenic emissions during summer varied across regions and was mainly affected by temperature. China\u2019s midlatitude areas (25 to 40 N) experienced a significant decrease in MDA8 O3 due to a decline in biogenic emissions, especially for the Yangtze River Delta and Sichuan Basin regions in 2014 and 2015. In contrast, in northern (north of 40 N) and southern (south of 25 N) China, higher temperatures after 2013 led to an increase in MDA8 O3 via an increase in biogenic emissions. We also assessed the individual effects of changes in temperature, specific humidity, wind field, planetary boundary layer height, clouds, and precipitation on ozone levels from 2013 to 2017. The results show that the wind field change made a significant contribution to the increase in surface ozone over many parts of China.

The satellite data estimates of land cover changes were compared to results from previous investigators that have either conducted regional studies or have used lower resolution land cover data. The analysis indicates that tree coverage increases of >5% occurred in 13% of locations including in central China and Europe. In contrast, a decrease of >5% was observed in about 5% of locations, especially in tropical regions. The trends in global tree coverage from 2000 to 2015 resulted in a global isoprene emission decrease of only 1.5%, but there were significant regional variations. Obvious decreases in tree coverage in some tropical areas (e.g., Amazon Basin, Western Africa, Southeast Asia) resulted in a ~10% reduction of regional isoprene emission due to agricultural expansion. Distinct increments of isoprene emission (5\u201310%) were mainly found in Northeast China and India and were associated with afforestation efforts. Deforestation and afforestation associated with managed plantations does not only affect the total forest coverage but also impacts average isoprene emission capacity, which can result in accelerated isoprene emission variations.

It also analyzes trends in the development of agricultural carbon emissions and the decoupling relationship between carbon emissions and the agricultural output of Hunan. In this study, emissions from two key segments of the agricultural sector were quantified: (1) crop production and (2) livestock and poultry production (singular). A combined method of principal component analysis (PCA), multiple regression analysis, and decoupling analysis was employed to assess the drivers of agricultural carbon emissions. This showed that there was a weak and unstable decoupling relationship between agricultural carbon emissions and their output value during the period of study. The PCA revealed that two main factors\u2014urbanization rate and nitrogen fertilization per acre\u2014explained 92.51\u00a0% of the variation in the 11 factors that affected carbon emissions from crops. Also, two main factors (i.e., agriculture per capita GDP and the ratio of beef production to total livestock production) explained 86.27\u00a0% of the variation in nine factors that affected carbon emissions from the livestock and poultry industry. Using the PCA scores as independent variables, a multiple regression analysis of carbon emissions from the crop industry and the livestock and poultry industry showed the following patterns. (1) Theoretically, given a 10\u00a0% reduction in nitrogen fertilization per acre, crop carbon emissions would decrease by 519 units. If the rate of urbanization were to increase by 1\u00a0%, crop carbon emissions would increase by 83 units; (2) similarly, a 1\u00a0% reduction in the beef: total livestock and poultry production ratio would reduce carbon emissions from that industry by 329 units, and with \u201cagricultural per capita GDP\u201d growth of 1 unit, those emissions would increase by 0.354 units.

These values degraded to 4.5 +/- 0.3 mm (tangential) and 6.6 +/- 0.3 mm (radial) FWHM and 10.6 +/- 1.6 mm (tangential) and 11.2 +/- 2.1 mm (radial) FWTM, respectively, at a distance of 40 mm from the centre of the transaxial FOV.

These materials are cheap, available near large point sources of CO2, and tend to react relatively rapidly with CO2 due to their chemical instability. Ground steel slag was carbonated in aqueous suspensions to study its reaction mechanisms. Process variables, such as particle size, temperature, carbon dioxide pressure, and reaction time, were systematically varied, and their influence on the carbonation rate was investigated. The maximum carbonation degree reached was 74% of the Ca content in 30 min at 19 bar CO2 pressure, 100 degrees C, and a particle size of <38 microm. The two most important factors determining the reaction rate are particle size (<2 mm to <38 microm) and reaction temperature (25-225 degrees C).

The vulnerable, low-level DPOAE have been associated with the postulated active cochlear process, whereas the relatively robust high-level DPOAE component has been attributed to the passive, nonlinear macromechanical properties of the cochlea. However, it is proposed that the differences in the vulnerability of DPOAEs to high and low SPLs is a natural consequence of the way the cochlea responds to high and low SPLs. An active process boosts the basilar membrane (BM) vibrations, which are attenuated when the active process is impaired. However, at high SPLs the contribution of the active process to BM vibration is small compared with the dominating passive mechanical properties of the BM. Consequently, reduction of active cochlear amplification will have greatest effect on BM vibrations and DPOAEs at low SPLs.

Achieving such a goal will entail a rapid transition away from reliance on petroleum for transportation and high carbon fuels for electricity generation towards alternative transportation fuels and low-carbon electrical generating technologies, including solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear, and coal with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Even with adoption rates for these technologies that are all near or even beyond the limits of plausibility, it will be impossible to achieve the desired emission reductions while simultaneously maintaining reasonable economic growth unless, in addition, the energy efficiency of the economy improves at a rate significantly above the historical trend.

The Waxman-Markey legislation recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives calls for U.S. carbon emissions to decline 83% from their level in 2005 by 2050. At various times President Obama has similarly called for emission reductions of over 80% by mid-century, and in July the President agreed with the other G8 leaders that the developed countries, including the U.S., should reduce their emissions 80% by 2050. These targets are loosely derived from integrated scientific and economic assessments of the consequences for the earth\u2019s climate of elevated atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. The problem of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions will affect all countries. Here we examine what would be required for the U.S. to achieve reductions in this general range. It is widely recognized that an effective strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions must focus on the energy sector, whose releases of carbon dioxide account for 80% of all U.S. anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. There are two essential elements of a strategy for reducing energy-related carbon emissions: first, improving the efficiency of energy use (energy productivity) or, equivalently, reducing the \u2018energy intensity\u2019 of the economy; and second, \u2018decarbonizing\u2019 the nation\u2019s energy supply infrastructure \u2013 that is, reducing the carbon intensity of the energy system by moving away from primary reliance on petroleum for transportation and high carbon fuels for electricity generation towards alternative transportation fuels and low or zero-carbon electrical generating technologies. It is evident that these two elements of an overall strategy are interdependent. The more rapid the transition to low carbon energy supplies, the less we will need to rely on energy end-use efficiency gains to achieve a given emission reduction target, and vice versa.

Base engine fuel use and APU and SP electrical load were analyzed for 20 trucks monitored for more than 1 yr during 2.76 million mi of activity within 42 U.S. states. The average base engine fuel use varied from 0.46 to 0.65 gal/hr. The average APU fuel use varied from 0.24 to 0.41 gal/hr. Fuel-use rates are typically lowest in mild weather, highest in hot or cold weather, and depend on engine speed (revolutions per minute [RPM]).

On the one hand, weights strictly lower than 1, or discount factors, would improve the environmental effectiveness of the CDM, enhancing global greenhouse gas emission mitigation while addressing the additionality concern. On the other hand, weights higher than 1, or multiplication factors, could increase the competitiveness of project types and/or host countries currently underrepresented in the CDM pipeline.

Changing wind patterns, studied in isolation, cause the Arctic burdens of tracers emitted from East Asia and West Europe during winter to increase about 20% by the end of the century while decreasing the Arctic burdens of North American emissions by about 30%. These changes are caused by an altered winter polar dome structure that results from Arctic amplification and inhomogeneous sea ice loss and surface warming, both of which are enhanced in the Chukchi Sea region. The resulting geostrophic wind favors Arctic transport of East Asian emissions while inhibiting poleward transport of North American emissions.

EED is an important multi-objective problem which minimizes both the fuel cost of generation and the amount of pollutants emission while EFD has the single objective of optimizing the amount of emission only.

Optimization of these problems determines the amount of optimum generation which to be allocated to each generating unit including renewable sources without violating system constraints and minimizing the amount of pollutant emissions as well as transmission losses. Extraction and storing of renewable energy at off-peak times or at times when there would be a surplus of its availability and reuse of such stored energy during its unavailable periods makes such approach more effective. Optimum EEDL and EFDL can be obtained by extracting maximum renewable energy during their availability periods, then using it for both available and unavailable periods with the aid of energy storage.

Initially, as methane production represents a significant loss of gross energy in the feed (2\u201315%), the ultimate goal of such intervention in rumen fermentation was an increase in feed efficiency. A second reason favouring research on methane inhibition is its role in the global warming phenomenon and in the destruction of the ozone layer. In this review, the authors describe briefly several interventions for reducing methane emission by ruminants. The objective can be reached by intervention at the dietary level by ration manipulation (composition, feeding level) or by the use of additives or supplements. Examples of additives are polyhalogenated compounds, ionophores and other antibiotics. Supplementation of the ration with lipids also lowered methanogenesis. More biotechnological interventions, e.g., defaunation, probiotics and introduction of reductive acetogenesis in the rumen, are also mentioned. It can be concluded that drastic inhibition of methane production is not unequivocally successful as a result of several factors, such as: instantaneous inhibition often followed by restoration of methanogenesis due to adaptation of the microbes or degradation of the additive, toxicity for the host animal, negative effects on overall digestion and productive performance. Therefore, methanogenesis and its inhibition cannot be considered as a separate part of rumen fermentation and its consequences on the animal should be taken into account.", "year": 1996}, {"paperId": "7867460f48552f8f3177af02b6a763596ef97b99", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2106501769", "DOI": "10.1002/chem.200902099", "CorpusId": 36444099, "PubMed": "20024989"}, "title": "Efficient intramolecular charge transfer in oligoyne-linked donor-pi-acceptor molecules.", "abstract": "Studies are reported on a series of triphenylamine-(C[triple bond]C)(n)-2,5-diphenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole dyad molecules (n=1-4, 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively) and the related triphenylamine-C(6)H(4)-(C[triple bond]C)(3)-oxadiazole dyad 5.

In polar solvents the LE state emission vanishes and only ICT emission is observed. This emission displays strong solvatochromism and analysis according to the Lippert-Mataga-Oshika formalism shows significant ICT for all the luminescent compounds with high efficiency even for the longer more conjugated systems.

However, even if climate is stabilised at current atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations, those warming targets would almost certainly be surpassed in the context of mean temperature increases over land only. The reason for this is two-fold. First, current transient warming lags significantly below equilibrium or \u201ccommitted\u201d warming. Second, almost all climate models indicate warming rates over land are much higher than those for the oceans.

The test bed for one project in this activity is a 2500 series Chevrolet Silverado equipped with a 6.6L Duramax diesel engine certified to 2002 model year (MY) Federal heavy-duty and 2002 MY California medium-duty emission standards While NAC systems have demonstrated extremely high levels of NO x reduction in steady-state laboratory evaluations, the application of a NAC system to an actual transient engine application requires the development of an integrated engine/emissions management system [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. This paper discusses the integrated engine/emissions system management and regeneration control strategies that were developed. The final control strategies achieved over 98% reductions in tailpipe NO x mass emissions over the hot-start portion of the light-duty Federal Test Procedure (FTP-75). This paper discusses thermal management of exhaust gas temperature to maintain the high efficiency window for NAC operation through the use of a diesel-fueled burner. The discussion will cover cold-start strategies and low exhaust gas temperature operation.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "9ce4663732d2e69ca7663a8135e91f427ddb93c6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2803100235", "DOI": "10.1115/ICEF2004-0937", "CorpusId": 111488247}, "title": "An Experimental Investigation of NOx Emission Reduction From Automotive Engine Using the Miller Cycle", "abstract": "An experimental investigation of NOx emission reduction from automotive (petrol) engine using the Miller Cycle was carried out.

Global anthropogenic emission inventories remain vital\nfor understanding the sources of atmospheric pollution and the associated impacts on the environment, human health, and society.\nRapid changes in today's society require that these inventories provide\ncontemporary estimates of multiple atmospheric pollutants with both source\nsector and fuel type information to understand and effectively mitigate\nfuture impacts. To fill this need, we have updated the open-source Community\nEmissions Data System (CEDS) (Hoesly et al., 2019) to\ndevelop a new global emission inventory, CEDSGBD-MAPS. This inventory\nincludes emissions of seven key atmospheric pollutants (NOx; CO;\nSO2; NH3; non-methane volatile organic compounds, NMVOCs; black carbon, BC; organic carbon, OC) over the time period from 1970\u20132017\nand reports annual country-total emissions as a function of 11 anthropogenic\nsectors (agriculture; energy generation; industrial processes;\non-road and non-road transportation; separate residential, commercial, and other\nsectors (RCO); waste; solvent use; and international shipping) and four fuel\ncategories (total coal, solid biofuel, the sum of liquid-fuel and\nnatural-gas combustion, and remaining process-level emissions). The\nCEDSGBD-MAPS inventory additionally includes monthly global gridded\n(0.5\u2218\u2009\u00d7\u20090.5\u2218) emission fluxes for each compound, sector, and fuel type to facilitate their\nuse in earth system models. CEDSGBD-MAPS utilizes updated activity\ndata, updates to the core CEDS default scaling procedure, and modifications\nto the final procedures for emissions gridding and aggregation. Relative to the previous CEDS inventory (Hoesly et\nal., 2018), these updates extend the emission estimates from 2014 to 2017\nand improve the overall agreement between CEDS and two widely used global\nbottom-up emission inventories. The CEDSGBD-MAPS inventory provides the\nmost contemporary global emission estimates to date for these key\natmospheric pollutants and is the first to provide global estimates for\nthese species as a function of multiple fuel types and source\nsectors. Dominant sources of global NOx and SO2 emissions in 2017\ninclude the combustion of oil, gas, and coal in the energy and industry\nsectors as well as on-road transportation and international shipping for\nNOx. Dominant sources of global CO emissions in 2017 include on-road\ntransportation and residential biofuel combustion. Dominant global sources\nof carbonaceous aerosol in 2017 include residential biofuel combustion,\non-road transportation (BC only), and emissions from the waste\nsector. Global emissions of NOx, SO2, CO, BC, and OC all peak in\n2012 or earlier, with more recent emission reductions driven by large\nchanges in emissions from China, North America, and Europe. In contrast,\nglobal emissions of NH3 and NMVOCs continuously increase between 1970\nand 2017, with agriculture as a major source of global NH3\nemissions and solvent use, energy, residential, and the on-road transport\nsectors as major sources of global NMVOCs. Due to similar development\nmethods and underlying datasets, the CEDSGBD-MAPS emissions are\nexpected to have consistent sources of uncertainty as other bottom-up\ninventories.

However, recently environmental authorities in large urban centers have expressed their concerns on the true effect of using ethanol blends of up to 20% v/v in in-use vehicles without any modification in the setup of the engine control unit (ECU), and on the variations of these effects along the years of operation of these vehicles. Their main concern is the potential increase in the emissions of volatile organic compounds with high ozone formation potential. To address these concerns, we developed analytical and experimental work testing engines under steady-conditions. We also tested carbureted and fuel-injected vehicles every 10,000 km during their first 100,000 km of operation. We measured the effect of using ethanol-gasoline blends on the power and torque generated, the fuel consumption and CO2, CO, NOx and unburned hydrocarbon emissions, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, benzene and 1,3-butadiene which are considered important ozone precursors. The obtained results showed statistically no significant differences in these variables when vehicles operate with a blend of 20% v/v ethanol and 80% v/v gasoline (E20) instead of gasoline. Those results remained unchanged during the first 100,000 km of operation of the vehicles. We also observed that when the vehicles operated with E20 at high engine loads, they showed a tendency to operate with greater values of \u03bb (ratio of the actual air-fuel ratio to the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio) when compared to their operation with gasoline. According to the Eco-Indicator-99, these results represent a minor reduction (<1.3%) on the impact to human health, and on the deterioration of the ecosystem. However, it implies a 12.9% deterioration of the natural resources. Thermal equilibrium analysis, at the tailpipe conditions (~100 \u00b0C), showed that ethane, formaldehyde, ethylene and ethanol are the most relevant VOCs in terms of the amount of mass emitted. The use of ethanol in the gasoline reduced 20\u201340% of those emissions.

Lignol Innovations has developed a biorefining technology that employs an ethanol-based organosolv step to separate lignin, hemicellulose components, and extractives from the cellulosic fraction of woody biomass. The resultant cellulosic fraction is highly susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis, generating very high yields of glucose (>90% in 12\u201324h) with typical enzyme loadings of 10\u201320 FPU (filter paper units)/g.

The process ethanol is recovered and recycled back to the process. The resulting recycled process water is of a very high quality, low BOD5, and suitable for overall system process closure. Significant benefits can be attained in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, as per the Kyoto Protocol.

Most of NOx, which is formed by ammonia combustion, is considered to be the fuel NOx. The objectives of this study were to investigate the fundamental characteristics of NOx experimentally, such as NO emission and chemiluminescence of ammonia/air flames not only at the atmospheric pressure but also under high pressures and to explore NO formation/reduction mechanisms using numerical simulation. Experiments were carried out using a nozzle-type burner. NH2 ammonia \uf061 band spectra were observed, and it was clarified that the color of ammonia flame is mainly determined by the NH2 ammonia \uf061 band and H2O spectra. Burned gas was sampled from ammonia flame stabilized at the burner. The mole fraction of NO decreased with the increase in equivalence ratio at atmospheric pressure. Reaction flow analysis was performed, and it was clarified that the decrease in the mole fraction of NO for rich mixtures was caused by NHi (i = 2, 1, 0). High pressure experiments were performed using a high pressure combustion test facility for stoichiometric ammonia flame. Consequently, the decrease in the mole fraction of NO was experimentally observed and its tendency was found to qualitatively agree with the results of the numerical simulation. It was clarified that the third body reaction of OH + H + M \uf0db H2O + M plays an important role in the reduction of the mole fraction of NO at high pressure.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "ed32dd736ebf392f2e4ad05c82f6aaadf75f21ef", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2130597315", "DOI": "10.1002/GHG.34", "CorpusId": 110845772}, "title": "Biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS or Bio-CCS)", "abstract": "In terms of climate mitigation options, the theoretical potential of biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is substantial; introducing the prospect of negative emissions, it offers the vision of drawing atmospheric CO 2 concentrations back down to pre\u2010industrial levels. This paper reviews issues raised at a workshop on BECCS, convened in Scotland in late 2009. Presentations by bioenergy and CCS specialists covered topics including the climate policy rationale for BECCS, global biomass CCS potential, the UK potential for BECCS, the risk of fossil fuel lock\u2010in via coal co\u2010firing, and carbon market issues. In practice, the scale of the forestry and accessible CCS infrastructure required are among the obstacles to the large\u2010scale deployment of BECCS in the near term. While biomass co\u2010firing with coal offers an early route to BECCS, a quite substantial (>20%) biomass component may be necessary to achieve negative emissions in a co\u2010fired CCS system. Smaller scale BECCS, through co\u2010location of dedicated or co\u2010combusted biomass on fossil CCS CO 2 transport pipeline routes, is easier to envisage and would be potentially less problematic. Hence, we judge that BECCS can, and likely will, play a role in carbon reduction, but care needs to be taken not to exaggerate its potential, given that (i) there are few studies of the cost of connecting bio\u2010processing (combustion, gasification or other) infrastructure with CO 2 storage sites and (ii) that scenarios of global bioenergy potential remain contentious. \u00a9 2011 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "ed98bc59c373d9c9fedde55b251fad91fd255cf6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2962376691", "DOI": "10.1021/es2018797", "CorpusId": 23218427, "PubMed": "22039912"}, "title": "Physicochemical characterization of particulate emissions from a compression ignition engine: the influence of biodiesel feedstock.", "abstract": "This study undertook a physicochemical characterization of particle emissions from a single compression ignition engine operated at one test mode with 3 biodiesel fuels made from 3 different feedstocks (i.e., soy, tallow, and canola) at 4 different blend percentages (20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) to gain insights into their particle-related health effects. Particle physical properties were inferred by measuring particle number size distributions both with and without heating within a thermodenuder (TD) and also by measuring particulate matter (PM) emission factors with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 \u03bcm (PM(10)). The chemical properties of particulates were investigated by measuring particle and vapor phase Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) and also Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) concentrations. The particle number size distributions showed strong dependency on feedstock and blend percentage with some fuel types showing increased particle number emissions, while others showed particle number reductions. In addition, the median particle diameter decreased as the blend percentage was increased. Particle and vapor phase PAHs were generally reduced with biodiesel, with the results being relatively independent of the blend percentage. The ROS concentrations increased monotonically with biodiesel blend percentage but did not exhibit strong feedstock variability. Furthermore, the ROS concentrations correlated quite well with the organic volume percentage of particles - a quantity which increased with increasing blend percentage. At higher blend percentages, the particle surface area was significantly reduced, but the particles were internally mixed with a greater organic volume percentage (containing ROS) which has implications for using surface area as a regulatory metric for diesel particulate matter (DPM) emissions.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "b7fc649dad457af6545017c113b44448b2beda2f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1841452204", "DOI": "10.3368/le.81.4.546", "CorpusId": 153561004}, "title": "Technological Change for Sulfur Dioxide Scrubbers under Market-Based Regulation", "abstract": "The 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) introduced tradable permits for controlling sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions from coal-burning power plants and forced scrubbers to compete with other SO2 abatement options. While the flexibility of permits reduced overall compliance costs, a secondary benefit would exist if there were resulting advances in scrubber technology. A hedonic model is used to estimate the effect of changing regulatory regimes on scrubber costs. While scrubbers installed under the 1990 CAAA are cheaper to purchase and operate than older scrubbers, these cost reductions seem to be a one-time drop rather than a continual decline.
