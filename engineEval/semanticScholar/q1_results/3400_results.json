In particular, nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the most important greenhouse gases, because it has a 300-fold higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide. Microbial denitrification is a major pathway responsible for nitrate removal, and also a dominant source of N2O emissions from terrestrial or aquatic environments. However, whether the release of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) into the environment affects microbial denitrification is largely unknown. Here we show that the presence of ZnO NPs lead to great increases in nitrate delivery (9.8-fold higher) and N2O emissions (350- and 174-fold higher in the gas and liquid phases, respectively). Our data further reveal that ZnO NPs significantly change the transcriptional regulations of glycolysis and polyhydroxybutyrate synthesis, which causes the decrease in reducing powers available for the reduction of nitrate and N2O. Moreover, ZnO NPs substantially inhibit the gene expressions and catalytic activities of key denitrifying enzymes. These negative effects of ZnO NPs on microbial denitrification finally cause lower nitrate removal and higher N2O emissions, which is likely to exacerbate water eutrophication and global warming.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "aae14ef2b8c40fc299aafa6daa58418c0d59b497", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2126916050", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-006-9112-8", "CorpusId": 59449989}, "title": "Dissecting Future Aerosol Emissions: warming Tendencies and Mitigation Opportunities", "abstract": "Future global emissions of aerosols will play an important role in governing the nature and magnitude of future anthropogenic climate change.

An ISA system monitors the location and speed of the vehicle, compares it to a defined set speed, and takes corrective action such as advising the driver and/or governing the top speed of the vehicle.

We measured the glutamate receptor binding in the human brain and provided direct evidence for the abnormal glutamate system in smokers. Because antagonism of the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) reduced nicotine self-administration in rats and mice, mGluR5 is suggested to be involved in nicotine addiction. mGluR5 receptor binding specifically to an allosteric site was observed by using positron emission tomography with [11C]ABP688. We found a marked global reduction (20.6%; P < 0.0001) in the mGluR5 distribution volume ratio (DVR) in the gray matter of 14 smokers. The most prominent reductions were found in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex. Compared with 14 nonsmokers, 14 ex-smokers had global reductions in the average gray matter mGluR5 DVR (11.5%; P < 0.005), and there was a significant difference in average gray matter mGluR5 DVR between smokers and ex-smokers (9.2%; P < 0.01). Clinical variables reflecting current nicotine consumption, dependence and abstinence were not correlated with mGluR5 DVR. This decrease in mGluR5 receptor binding may be an adaptation to chronic increases in glutamate induced by chronic nicotine administration, and the decreased down-regulation seen in the ex-smokers could be due to incomplete recovery of the receptors, especially because the ex-smokers were abstinent for only 25 wk on average.

In our model, consumers are willing to pay a higher price for low-carbon products and hence the retailer considers sharing the cost of carbon emission reduction with the manufacturer. Our model also includes a carbon trading mechanism. We identify a range of carbon emission reduction cost-sharing such that both supply chain enterprises are better-off.

The environmental performance of corn grain varies with its farming location because of climate, soil properties, cropping management, etc. Corn stover, all of the above ground parts of the corn plant except the grain, would be used as a feedstock for cellulosic ethanol.Materials and methodsTwo cropping systems are under investigation: corn produced for grain only without collecting corn stover (referred to as CRN) and corn produced for grain and stover harvest (referred to as CSR). The functional unit in this study is defined as dry biomass, and the reference flow is 1\u00a0kg of dry biomass. The system boundary includes processes from cradle to farm gate. The default allocation procedure between corn grain and stover in the CSR system is the system expansion approach. County-level soil organic carbon dynamics, nitrate losses due to leaching, and nitrogen oxide and nitrous oxide emissions are simulated by the DAYCENT model. Life cycle environmental impact categories considered in this study are total fossil energy use, climate change (referred to as greenhouse gas emissions), acidification, and eutrophication. Sensitivities on farming practices and allocation are included.ResultsSimulations from the DAYCENT model predict that removing corn stover from soil could decrease nitrogen-related emissions from soil (i.e., N2O, NOx, and NO3\u2212 leaching). DAYCENT also predicts a reduction in the annual accumulation rates of soil organic carbon (SOC) with corn stover removal. Corn stover has a better environmental performance than corn grain according to all life cycle environmental impacts considered. This is due to lower consumption of agrochemicals and fuel used in the field operations and lower nitrogen-related emissions from the soil.DiscussionThe primary source of total fossil energy associated with biomass production is nitrogen fertilizer, accounting for over 30% of the total fossil energy. Nitrogen-related emissions from soil (i.e., N2O, NOx, and NO3\u2212 leaching) are the primary contributors to all other life cycle environmental impacts considered in this study.ConclusionsThe environmental performance of corn grain and corn stover varies with the farming location due to crop management, soil properties, and climate conditions. Several general trends were identified from this study. Corn stover has a lower impact than corn grain in terms of total fossil energy, greenhouse gas emissions, acidification, and eutrophication. Harvesting corn stover reduces nitrogen-related emissions from the soil (i.e., N2O, NOx, NO3\u2212). The accumulation rate of soil organic carbon is reduced when corn stover is removed, and in some cases, the soil organic carbon level decreases. Harvesting only the cob portion of the stover would reduce the negative impact of stover removal on soil organic carbon sequestration rate while still bringing the benefit of lower nitrogen-related emissions from the soil. No-tillage practices offer higher accumulation rates of soil organic carbon, lower fuel consumption, and lower nitrogen emissions from the soil than the current or conventional tillage practices. Planting winter cover crops could be a way to reduce nitrogen losses from soil and to increase soil organic carbon levels.Recommendations and perspectivesCounty-level modeling is more accurate in estimating the local environmental burdens associated with biomass production than national- or regional-level modeling. When possible, site-specific experimental information on soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics should be obtained to reflect the system more accurately. The allocation approach between corn grain and stover significantly affects the environmental performance of each. The preferred allocation method is the system expansion approach where incremental fuel usage, additional nutrients in the subsequent growing season, and changes in soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics due to removing corn stover are assigned to only the collected corn stover.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "455c3ed9f1e9ac4e76849b343623605a33e5789f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2263152393", "DOI": "10.1080/09535314.2015.1135309", "CorpusId": 59577324}, "title": "Explaining value chain differences in MRIO databases through structural path decomposition", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Many multiregional input\u2013output (MRIO) databases are used to calculate consumption-based accounts.

A benefit-cost ratio rule is proposed which distributes any remaining surplus after each coalition member receives their payoff as a non-signatory. Simulations of 20 asymmetric nations illustrate that even when the gains to cooperation are large, IEAs can achieve substantial emissions reductions.

Detailed research proved that the emission of dioxins might occur during combustion of hard coal, brown coal, and furnace oil as well as coke-oven gas. The emission of dioxins occurs in wood incineration; wood that is clean and understood as biomass; or, in particular, wood waste (polluted). This paper thoroughly discusses the mechanism of dioxin formation in thermal processes, first and foremost in combustion processes. The parameters influencing the quantity of dioxins formed and the dependence of their quantity on the conditions of combustion are highlighted. Furthermore, the methods of reducing dioxin emissions from combustion processes (primary and secondary) are discussed. The most efficacious methods that may find application in the heat and power generation sector are proposed; this is relevant from the point of view of the implementation of the Stockholm Convention resolutions in Poland with regard to persistent organic pollutants. IMPLICATIONS In this study, the problem of emission of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzofurans from the heat and power generation sector is discussed. It is proven that practically all combustion processes may be a source of emission of dioxins into the atmosphere. The implementation of the Stockholm Convention with reference to persistent organic pollutants will require that the measures leading to the reduction of dioxin emissions will also be taken in this sector.

The authors used [(11)C]DASB positron emission tomography to measure occupancies of three other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) at minimum therapeutic doses. The relationship between dose and occupancy was also investigated.\n\n\nMETHOD\nStriatal 5-HTT binding potential was measured in 77 subjects before and after 4 weeks of medication administration. Binding potential is proportional to the density of receptors not blocked by medication. Subjects received citalopram, fluoxetine, sertraline, paroxetine, or extended-release venlafaxine. Healthy subjects received subtherapeutic doses; subjects with mood and anxiety disorders received therapeutic doses. Percent reduction in 5-HTT binding potential for each medication and dose was calculated. To obtain test-retest data, binding potential was measured before and after 4 weeks in six additional healthy subjects.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSubstantial occupancy occurred at subtherapeutic doses for all SSRIs. Compared to test-retest data, each drug at the minimum therapeutic dose had a significant effect on striatal 5-HTT binding potential. Mean occupancy at this dose was 76%-85%. At higher plasma SSRI concentrations, 5-HTT occupancy tended to increase above 80%. For each drug, as the dose (or plasma level) increased, occupancy increased nonlinearly, with a plateau for higher doses.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nAt tolerable doses, SSRIs have increasing occupancy with increasing plasma concentration or dose. Occupancy of 80% across five SSRIs occurs at minimum therapeutic doses. This suggests that 80% 5-HTT blockade is important for therapeutic effect. Occupancy should be measured during development of antidepressant compounds targeting the 5-HTT.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "4b09e8a83bba46a89299f709613721c6b67a07ec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2023337167", "DOI": "10.1007/s10705-009-9285-4", "CorpusId": 5888962}, "title": "Nitrogen and biofuels; an overview of the current state of knowledge", "abstract": "Biofuels are forms of energy (heat, power, transport fuels or chemicals) based on different kinds of biomass.

Agriculture accounts for 48% of GHG emissions in New Zealand, and 10\u201312% of emissions in most other \u2018developed\u2019 countries. Methane (CH4) accounts for 35% of GHG emissions in New Zealand, mostly from ruminal fermentation. Nitrous oxide (N2O) accounts for 17% of GHG emissions in New Zealand, mostly from urinary N, exacerbated by excessive application of nitrogenous fertiliser. GHG are often expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e), and 1 kg CH4 has a similar global-warming potential as 21 kg CO2, whilst 1 kg N2O has the same warming potential as 310 kg CO2. Methane is derived from H2 produced during ruminal fermentation, and losses account for 6\u20137% of gross energy in feeds. This is about 9\u201310% of metabolisable energy intake. Methane production tends to be lower when legumes, rather than grasses, are fed, and emissions are greater (per kg dry matter intake; DMI) when mature grasses and silages are fed. There are small differences between individual animals in their CH4 production (g/kg DMI) but there are few profitable options available for reducing CH4 production in ruminants. Emissions of N2O can be reduced by more strategic application of nitrogenous fertiliser, avoidance of waterlogged areas, and use of dicyandiamide in some cooler regions. GHG mitigation should be based on life-cycle analyses to ensure a reduction in one GHG does not increase another. Current and future strategies are unlikely to reduce GHG emissions by >20%.

A secondary objective was to determine the effect of supplementing the diet with WCS on milk yield and rumen function over the 12-wk feeding period. Fifty lactating cows were randomly allocated to 1 of 2 diets (control or WCS). The 2 separate groups were each offered, on average, 4.2 kg of DM/cow per day of alfalfa hay (a.m.) and 6.6 kg of DM/cow per day of ryegrass silage (p.m.) on the ground in bare paddocks each day for 12 wk. Cows in each group were also individually offered dietary supplements for 12 wk in a feed trough at milking times of 5.4 kg of DM/cow per day of cracked wheat grain and 0.5 kg of DM/cow per day of cottonseed meal (control) or 2.8 kg of DM/cow per day of cracked wheat grain and 2.61 kg of DM/cow per day of WCS. The 2 diets were formulated to be similar in their concentrations of CP and ME, but the WCS diet was designed to have a higher fat concentration. Samples of rumen fluid were collected per fistula from the rumen approximately 4 h after grain feeding in the morning. Samples were taken from 8 cows (4 cows/diet) on 2 consecutive days in wk 2 of the covariate and wk 3, 6, 10, and 12 of treatment and analyzed for volatile fatty acids, ammonia-N, methanogens, and protozoa. The reduction in CH(4) emissions (g/d) because of WCS supplementation increased from 13% in wk 3 to 23% in wk 12 of treatment. Similarly, the reduction in CH(4) emissions (g/kg of DMI) increased from 5.1% in wk 3 to 14.5% in wk 12 of treatment. It was calculated that the average reduction in CH(4) emissions over the 12-wk period was 2.9% less CH(4) per 1% added fat, increasing from 1.5% in wk 3 to 4.4% less CH(4) in wk 12.

The WCS supplementation had no effect on milk fat concentration but resulted in a decrease in concentration of protein (5%) and lactose (11%). The major finding from this study is that addition of WCS to the diet of lactating dairy cows resulted in a persistent reduction in CH(4) emissions (g of CH(4)/kg of DMI) over a 12-wk period and that these reductions in CH(4) are consistent with previous work that has studied the addition of oilseeds to ruminant diets.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "d2bb3c437edf05f4806bfa5739f7b397fba30e60", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2770974839", "DOI": "10.1080/15567036.2017.1349216", "CorpusId": 103619773}, "title": "Investigation on the emission quality characteristics of a diesel engine fueled with algae biofuel with nano additives", "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this study, Botryococcus braunii algal oil has been converted into methyl ester with the aid of transesterification reaction.

However, existing models do not readily translate into quantitative targets against which we can judge the dynamic performance of technologies. Here, we present a simple, new model for evaluating energy-supply technologies and their improvement trajectories against climate-change mitigation goals. We define a target for technology performance in terms of the carbon intensity of energy, consistent with emission reduction goals, and show how the target depends upon energy demand levels. Because the cost of energy determines the level of adoption, we then compare supply technologies to one another and to this target based on their position on a cost and carbon trade-off curve and how the position changes over time. Applying the model to U.S. electricity, we show that the target for carbon intensity will approach zero by midcentury for commonly cited emission reduction goals, even under a high demand-side efficiency scenario. For Chinese electricity, the carbon intensity target is relaxed and less certain because of lesser emission reductions and greater variability in energy demand projections. Examining a century-long database on changes in the cost-carbon space, we find that the magnitude of changes in cost and carbon intensity that are required to meet future performance targets is not unprecedented, providing some evidence that these targets are within engineering reach.

However, estimated GHG emission reductions of lightweighting depend on multiple factors including the vehicle powertrain technology and efficiency, lightweight material employed, and end-of-life material recovery. We developed a fleet-based life cycle model to estimate the GHG emission changes due to lightweighting the U.S. light-duty fleet from 2016 to 2050, using either high strength steel or aluminum as the lightweight material. Our model estimates that implementation of an aggressive lightweighting scenario using aluminum reduces 2016 through 2050 cumulative life cycle GHG emissions from the fleet by 2.9 Gt CO2 eq (5.6%), and annual emissions in 2050 by 11%. Lightweighting has the greatest GHG emission reduction potential when implemented in the near-term, with two times more reduction per kilometer traveled if implemented in 2016 rather than in 2030. Delaying implementation by 15 years sacrifices 72% (2.1 Gt CO2 eq) of the cumulative GHG emission\u00a0mitigation potential through 2050.

We develop a Linear Programming (LP) model for energy minimization in the network when renewable energy is used and propose a novel heuristic for improving renewable energy utilization. Compared with routing in the electronic layer, routing in the optical layer coupled with renewable energy nodes significantly reduces the CO2 emission of the IP over WDM network considered by 47% to 52%, and the new heuristic introduced hardly affects the QoS. In order to identify the impact of the number and the location of nodes that employ renewable energy on the non-renewable energy consumption of whole network, we also constructed another LP model. The results show that the nodes at the center of the network have more impact than other nodes if they use renewable energy sources. We have also investigated the additional energy savings that can be gained through Adaptive Link Rate (ALR) techniques where different load dependent energy consumption profiles are considered. Our optimized REO-hop routing algorithm with renewable energy and ALR results in a maximum energy saving of 85% (average of 65%) compared to a current network design where all nodes are statically dimensioned for the maximum traffic in terms of IP ports and optical layer and hence consume power accordingly.

PHB (from either feedstock) is unlikely to have lower emissions than fossil polymers once end of life emissions are included. PLA generally has the lowest emissions when compared to high emission fossil polymers, such as polystyrene (mean GHG savings up to 1.4 kg CO2e/kg corn PLA and 2.9 kg CO2e/kg switchgrass PLA).

Most countries submitted NDCs before the Paris Agreement. According to our analyses using a global energy and GHG emission reduction assessment model, the emission reduction costs of the NDCs vary widely among countries; and those differences will induce carbon leakage, thus the expected global emission reduction is smaller than that predicted by simply aggregating the emission reductions of all the countries.

A life-cycle assessment was conducted to quantify the GHG emissions of a hypothetic 100 million liters per year HTL biofuel system in the Coast Region of BC. Three scenarios were defined and investigated, namely, supply of bulky forest residues for conversion in a central integrated refinery (Fr-CIR), HTL of forest residues to bio-oil in distributed biorefineries and subsequent upgrading in a central oil refinery (Bo-DBR), and densification of forest residues in distributed pellet plants and conversion in a central integrated refinery (Wp-CIR).ResultsThe life-cycle GHG emissions of HTL biofuels is 20.5, 17.0, and 19.5\u00a0g CO2-eq/MJ for Fr-CIR, Bo-DBR, and Wp-CIR scenarios, respectively, corresponding to 78\u201382% reduction compared with petroleum fuels. The conversion stage dominates the total GHG emissions, making up more than 50%. The process emitting most GHGs over the life cycle of HTL biofuels is HTL buffer production. Transportation emission, accounting for 25% of Fr-CIR, can be lowered by 83% if forest residues are converted to bio-oil before transportation. When the credit from biochar applied for soil amendment is considered, a further reduction of 6.8\u00a0g CO2-eq/MJ can be achieved.ConclusionsConverting forest residues to bio-oil and wood pellets before transportation can significantly lower the transportation emission and contribute to a considerable reduction of the life-cycle GHG emissions. Process performance parameters (e.g., HTL energy requirement and biofuel yield) and the location specific parameter (e.g., electricity mix) have significant influence on the GHG emissions of HTL biofuels.

This brief analysis estimates the potential climate ramifications of changing US leadership, contrasting the Mid-Century Strategy for Deep Decarbonization (MCS) released under the Obama Administration, with campaign statements, early executive actions, and prevailing market conditions to estimate potential emission pathways under the Trump Administration. The analysis highlights areas where GHG reductions are less robust to changing policy conditions, and offers brief recommendations for addressing emissions in the interim. It specifically finds that continued reductions in the electricity sector are less vulnerable to changes in federal policy than those in the built environment and land use sectors. Given the long-lived nature of investments in these latter two sectors, however, opportunities for near-term climate action by willing cities, states, private landowners, and non-profit organizations warrant renewed attention in this time of climate uncertainty. Key policy insights The recent US presidential election has already impacted mitigation goals and practices, injecting considerable uncertainty into domestic and international efforts to address climate change. A strategic assessment issued in the final days of the Obama Administration for how to reach long-term climate mitigation objectives provides a baseline from which to gauge potential changes under the Trump Administration. Though market trends may continue to foster emission declines in the energy sector, emission reductions in the land use sector and the built environment are subject to considerable uncertainty. Regardless of actions to scale back climate mitigation efforts, US emissions are likely to be flat in the coming years.

To address this issue, we developed a risk-based model to estimate the health benefits associated with marginal energy usage reductions and applied the model to a hypothetical case study of insulation retrofits in single-family homes in the United States.MethodsWe modeled energy savings with a regression model that extrapolated findings from an energy simulation program. Reductions of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions and particle precursors (SO2 and NOx) were quantified using fuel-specific emission factors and marginal electricity analyses. Estimates of population exposure per unit emissions, varying by location and source type, were extrapolated from past dispersion model runs. Concentration-response functions for morbidity and mortality from PM2.5 were derived from the epidemiological literature, and economic values were assigned to health outcomes based on willingness to pay studies.ResultsIn total, the insulation retrofits would save 800 TBTU (8 \u00d7 1014 British Thermal Units) per year across 46 million homes, resulting in 3,100 fewer tons of PM2.5, 100,000 fewer tons of NOx, and 190,000 fewer tons of SO2 per year. These emission reductions are associated with outcomes including 240 fewer deaths, 6,500 fewer asthma attacks, and 110,000 fewer restricted activity days per year.

The health benefits correspond to $1.3 billion per year in externalities averted, compared with $5.9 billion per year in economic savings.ConclusionIn spite of significant uncertainties related to the interpretation of PM2.5 health effects and other dimensions of the model, our analysis demonstrates that a risk-based methodology is viable for national-level energy efficiency programs.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "21918dcebc371b46b672d581bc116c0251e34283", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2145910174", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1009715807023", "CorpusId": 33422092}, "title": "Measurement of nitrous oxide and di-nitrogen emissions from agricultural soils", "abstract": "Nitrous oxide can be produced during nitrification, denitrification, dissimilatory reduction of NO3- to NH4+ and chemo-denitrification. Since soils are a mosaic of aerobic and anaerobic zones, it is likely that multiple processes are contributing simultaneously to N2O production in a soil profile. The N2O produced by all processes may mix to form one pool before being reduced to N2 by denitrification. Reliable methods are needed for measuring the fluxes of N2O and N2 simultaneously from agricultural soils. The C2H2 inhibition and 15N gas-flux methods are suitable for use in undisturbed soils in the field. The main disadvantage of C2H2 is that as well as blocking N2O reductase, it also blocks nitrification and dissimilatory reduction of NO3- to NH4+. Potentially the 15 N gas-flux method can give reliable measurements of the fluxes of N2O and N2 when all N transformation processes proceed naturally. The analysis of 15N in N2 and N2O is now fully automated by continuous-flow isotope-ratio mass spectrometry for 12-ml gas samples contained in septum-capped vials. Depending on the methodology, the limit of detection ranges from 4 to 11 g N ha-1day-1 for N2 and 4 to 15 g N ha-1day-1 for N2O. By measuring the 15N content and distribution of 15N atoms in the N2O molecules, information can also be obtained to help diagnose the sources of N2O and the processes producing it. Only a limited number of field studies have been done using the 15N gas-flux method on agricultural soils. The measured flux rates and mole fractions of N2O have been highly variable. In rain-fed agricultural soils, soil temperature and water-filled pore space change with the weather and so are difficult to modify. Soil organic C, NO3- and pH should be amenable to more control. The effect of organic C depends on the degree of anaerobiosis generated as a result of its metabolism. If conditions for denitrification are not limiting, split applications of organic C will produce more N2O than a single application because of the time lag in the synthesis of N2O reductase. Increasing the NO3- concentration above the Km value for NO3- reductase, or decreasing soil pH from 7 to 5, will have little effect on denitrification rate but will increase the mole fraction of N2O. The effect of NO3- concentration on the mole fraction of N2O is enhanced at low pH. Manipulating the interaction between NO3- supply and soil pH offers the best hope for minimising N2O and N2 fluxes.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "aedf95795203bfb9b666e3e6a3375e148038167c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1993485215", "DOI": "10.1016/S0360-3199(02)00289-6", "CorpusId": 95624506}, "title": "NOx emission reduction in a hydrogen fueled internal combustion engine at 3000 rpm using exhaust gas recirculation", "abstract": null, "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "390a6059b504a68eafae008110027159d1aa849c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2801475548", "DOI": "10.1021/ACSSUSCHEMENG.8B01448", "CorpusId": 104179685}, "title": "Construction of Direct Z-Scheme AgI/Bi2Sn2O7 Nanojunction System with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity: Accelerated Interfacial Charge Transfer Induced Efficient Cr(VI) Reduction, Tetracycline Degradation and Escherichia coli Inactivation", "abstract": "The exploration of highly efficient visible light driven photocatalysts for diverse pollutants removal has received great concerns in wastewater treatment.

We studied the temperature response of postillumination isoprene emission in oak (Quercus robur) and poplar (Populus deltoides) leaves in order to understand the regulation of isoprene emission. Upon darkening a leaf, isoprene emission fell nearly to zero but then increased for several minutes before falling back to nearly zero. Time of appearance of this burst of isoprene was highly temperature dependent, occurring sooner at higher temperatures.

The amount of this early metabolite(s) averaged 2.9 times the amount of plastidic DMADP. DMADP increased with temperature up to 35\u00b0C before starting to decrease; in contrast, the isoprene synthase rate constant increased up to 40\u00b0C, the highest temperature at which it could be assessed. During a rapid temperature switch from 30\u00b0C to 40\u00b0C, isoprene emission increased transiently. It was found that an increase in isoprene synthase activity is primarily responsible for this transient increase in emission levels, while DMADP level stayed constant during the switch. One hour after switching to 40\u00b0C, the amount of DMADP fell but the rate constant for isoprene synthase remained constant, indicating that the high temperature falloff in isoprene emission results from a reduction in the supply of DMADP rather than from changes in isoprene synthase activity.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "ad0c95ebb587f02138e75ed4e48beb6b0b915d79", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2803438242", "DOI": "10.1126/science.aar6611", "CorpusId": 44065977, "PubMed": "29798857"}, "title": "Beyond fossil fuel\u2013driven nitrogen transformations", "abstract": "Transforming nitrogen without carbon How much carbon does it take to make nitric acid? The counterintuitive answer nowadays is quite a lot. Nitric acid is manufactured by ammonia oxidation, and all the hydrogen to make ammonia via the Haber-Bosch process comes from methane. That's without even accounting for the fossil fuels burned to power the process. Chen et al. review research prospects for more sustainable routes to nitrogen commodity chemicals, considering developments in enzymatic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous catalysis, as well as electrochemical, photochemical, and plasma-based approaches. Science, this issue p. eaar6611 BACKGROUND The invention of the Haber-Bosch (H-B) process in the early 1900s to produce ammonia industrially from nitrogen and hydrogen revolutionized the manufacture of fertilizer and led to fundamental changes in the way food is produced. Its impact is underscored by the fact that about 50% of the nitrogen atoms in humans today originate from this single industrial process. In the century after the H-B process was invented, the chemistry of carbon moved to center stage, resulting in remarkable discoveries and a vast array of products including plastics and pharmaceuticals. In contrast, little has changed in industrial nitrogen chemistry. This scenario reflects both the inherent efficiency of the H-B process and the particular challenge of breaking the strong dinitrogen bond. Nonetheless, the reliance of the H-B process on fossil fuels and its associated high CO2 emissions have spurred recent interest in finding more sustainable and environmentally benign alternatives. Nitrogen in its more oxidized forms is also industrially, biologically, and environmentally important, and synergies in new combinations of oxidative and reductive transformations across the nitrogen cycle could lead to improved efficiencies. ADVANCES Major effort has been devoted to developing alternative and environmentally friendly processes that would allow NH3 production at distributed sources under more benign conditions, rather than through the large-scale centralized H-B process. Hydrocarbons (particularly methane) and water are the only two sources of hydrogen atoms that can sustain long-term, large-scale NH3 production. The use of water as the hydrogen source for NH3 production requires substantially more energy than using methane, but it is also more environmentally benign, does not contribute to the accumulation of greenhouse gases, and does not compete for valuable and limited hydrocarbon resources. Microbes living in all major ecosystems are able to reduce N2 to NH3 by using the enzyme nitrogenase. A deeper understanding of this enzyme could lead to more efficient catalysts for nitrogen reduction under ambient conditions. Model molecular catalysts have been designed that mimic some of the functions of the active site of nitrogenase. Some modest success has also been achieved in designing electrocatalysts for dinitrogen reduction. Electrochemistry avoids the expense and environmental damage of steam reforming of methane (which accounts for most of the cost of the H-B process), and it may provide a means for distributed production of ammonia. On the oxidative side, nitric acid is the principal commodity chemical containing oxidized nitrogen. Nearly all nitric acid is manufactured by oxidation of NH3 through the Ostwald process, but a more direct reaction of N2 with O2 might be practically feasible through further development of nonthermal plasma technology. Heterogeneous NH3 oxidation with O2 is at the heart of the Ostwald process and is practiced in a variety of environmental protection applications as well. Precious metals remain the workhorse catalysts, and opportunities therefore exist to develop lower-cost materials with equivalent or better activity and selectivity. Nitrogen oxides are also environmentally hazardous pollutants generated by industrial and transportation activities, and extensive research has gone into developing and applying reduction catalysts. Three-way catalytic converters are operating on hundreds of millions of vehicles worldwide. However, increasingly stringent emissions regulations, coupled with the low exhaust temperatures of high-efficiency engines, present challenges for future combustion emissions control. Bacterial denitrification is the natural analog of this chemistry and another source of study and inspiration for catalyst design. OUTLOOK Demands for greater energy efficiency, smaller-scale and more flexible processes, and environmental protection provide growing impetus for expanding the scope of nitrogen chemistry. Nitrogenase, as well as nitrifying and denitrifying enzymes, will eventually be understood in sufficient detail that robust molecular catalytic mimics will emerge. Electrochemical and photochemical methods also demand more study. Other intriguing areas of research that have provided tantalizing results include chemical looping and plasma-driven processes. The grand challenge in the field of nitrogen chemistry is the development of catalysts and processes that provide simple, low-energy routes to the manipulation of the redox states of nitrogen. Possible routes for nitrogen transformations that eliminate or minimize the need for fossil fuels. A more thorough understanding of nitrogenase may lead to more efficient homogeneous catalysts for reduction of N2 to NH3. Coupling of theory and experiment will lead to more effective and stable heterogeneous and electrocatalysts. Innovative energy sources, such as plasmas, which involve nonequilibrium chemistry, may lead to new nitrogen conversion mechanisms. ILLUSTRATION: K. HOLOSKI Nitrogen is fundamental to all of life and many industrial processes. The interchange of nitrogen oxidation states in the industrial production of ammonia, nitric acid, and other commodity chemicals is largely powered by fossil fuels. A key goal of contemporary research in the field of nitrogen chemistry is to minimize the use of fossil fuels by developing more efficient heterogeneous, homogeneous, photo-, and electrocatalytic processes or by adapting the enzymatic processes underlying the natural nitrogen cycle.

A particular benefit is that it can alleviate competition for land conventionally used for food and feed production. In this research, we investigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production of ethanol, biomethane, limonene and digestate from citrus waste, a byproduct of the citrus processing industry. The study represents the first life cycle-based evaluations of citrus waste biorefineries. Two biorefinery configurations are studied\u2014a large biorefinery that converts citrus waste into ethanol, biomethane, limonene and digestate, and a small biorefinery that converts citrus waste into biomethane, limonene and digestate. Ethanol is assumed to be used as E85, displacing gasoline as a light-duty vehicle fuel; biomethane displaces natural gas for electricity generation, limonene displaces acetone in solvents, and digestate from the anaerobic digestion process displaces synthetic fertilizer. System expansion and two allocation methods (energy, market value) are considered to determine emissions of co-products. Considerable GHG reductions would be achieved by producing and utilizing the citrus waste-based products in place of the petroleum-based or other non-renewable products. For the large biorefinery, ethanol used as E85 in light-duty vehicles results in a 134% reduction in GHG emissions compared to gasoline-fueled vehicles when applying a system expansion approach. For the small biorefinery, when electricity is generated from biomethane rather than natural gas, GHG emissions are reduced by 77% when applying system expansion. The life cycle GHG emissions vary substantially depending upon biomethane leakage rate, feedstock GHG emissions and the method to determine emissions assigned to co-products. Among the process design parameters, the biomethane leakage rate is critical, and the ethanol produced in the large biorefinery would not meet EISA\u2019s requirements for cellulosic biofuel if the leakage rate is higher than 9.7%. For the small biorefinery, there are no GHG emission benefits in the production of biomethane if the leakage rate is higher than 11.5%.

The atmospheric load of CO2-equivalent Cpresent over a time horizon is a possible indicator ofthe climatic impact of the emission that placed thisload in the atmosphere. Conversely, this index alsoprovides a measure of the benefit of notproducing the emission. One accounting methodcompares sequestered CO2 in trees with theCO2 that would be in the atmosphere had thesequestration project not been undertaken, whileanother method (used in this paper) compares theatmospheric load of C (or equivalent in non-CO2GHGs) in both project and no-project scenarios.Time preference, expressed by means of a discount rateon C, can be applied to Mg-year equivalencecalculations to allow societal decisions regarding thevalue of time to be integrated into the system forcalculating global warming impacts and benefits. Giving a high value to time, either by raising thediscount rate or by shortening the time horizon,increases the value attributed to temporarysequestration (such as many forest plantationprojects). A high value for time also favorsmitigation measures that have rapid effects (such asslowing deforestation rates) as compared to measuresthat only affect emissions years in the future (suchas creating protected areas in countries with largeareas of remaining forest). Decisions on temporalissues will guide mitigation efforts towards optionsthat may or may not be desirable on the basis ofsocial and environmental effects in spheres other thanglobal warming. How sustainable development criteriaare incorporated into the approval and creditingsystems for activities under the Kyoto Protocol willdetermine the overall environmental and social impactsof pending decisions on temporal issues.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "52e69b139425a88648446032d6a229eb23758326", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2142708673", "DOI": "10.1046/J.1469-8137.1998.00167.X", "CorpusId": 85776353}, "title": "The atmospheric budget of oxidized nitrogen and its role in ozone formation and deposition", "abstract": "Emissions of reactive oxidized nitrogen (NO and NO 2 ), collectively known as NO x , from human activities are c. 21 Tg N annually, or 70% of global total emissions. They occur predominantly in industrialized regions, largely from fossil fuel combustion, but also from increased use of N fertilizers. Soil emissions of NO not only make an important contribution to global totals, but also play a part in regulating the dry deposition of NO and NO 2 (NO x ) to plant canopies. Soil microbial production of NO leads to a soil 'compensation point' for NO deposition or emission, which depends on soil temperature, N and water status. In warm conditions, the net emission of NO x from plant canopies contributes to the photochemical formation of ozone. Moreover, the effect of NO x emissions from soil is to reduce net rates of NO 2 deposition to terrestrial surfaces over large areas. Increasing anthropogenic emissions of NO x have led to an approximate doubling in surface O 3 concentrations since the last century. NO x acts as a catalyst for the production of O 3 from volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Paradoxically, emission controls on motor vehicles might lead to increases in O 3 concentrations in urban areas. Removal of NO and NO 2 by dry deposition is regulated to some extent by soil production of NO; the major sink for NO 2 is stomatal uptake. Long-term flux measurements over moorland in Scotland show very small deposition rates for NO 2 at night and before mid-day of 1-4 ng NO 2 -N m -2 s -1 and similar emission rates during afternoon. The bi-directional flux gives 24-h average deposition velocities of only 1-2 mm s -1 , and implies a long life-time for NO x due to removal by dry deposition. Rates of removal of O 3 at the ground are also influenced by stomatal uptake, but significant non-stomatal uptake occurs at night and in winter. Measurements above moorland showed 40 % of total annual flux was stomatal, with 60%, non-stomatal, giving nocturnal and winter deposition velocities of 2-3 mm s -1 and daytime summer values of 10 mm s -1 . The stomatal uptake is responsible for adverse effects on vegetation. The critical level for O 3 exposure (AOT 40 ) is used to derive a threshold O 3 stomatal flux for wheat of 0.5 \u03bcg m -2 s -1 . Use of modelled stomatal fluxes rather than exposure might give more reliable estimates of yield loss; preliminary calculations suggest that the relative grain yield reduction (%) can be estimated as 38 times the stomatal ozone flux (g m -2 ) above the threshold, summed over the growing season.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "7690a764a69e35df6db343e6125b767acf6775fe", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2093896675", "DOI": "10.1073/PNAS.77.9.5253", "CorpusId": 2862705, "PubMed": "6933557"}, "title": "Chloroplast phosphoproteins: regulation of excitation energy transfer by phosphorylation of thylakoid membrane polypeptides.", "abstract": "Incubation of isolated chloroplast thylakoid membranes with [gamma-32P]ATP results in phosphorylation of surface-exposed segments of several membrane proteins.

Shipping is a growing sector in the global economy, and it contributions to global CO 2 emissions are expected to increase. CO 2 emissions from the world shipping fleet will likely be regulated in the near future, and studies have shown that significant emission reductions can be achieved at low cost. Regulations are being discussed for both existing ships as well as for future additions to the fleet. In this study a plausible CO 2 emission reduction inventory is constructed for the cargo fleet existing in 2010, as well as for container ships, bulk ships and tankers separately. In the reduction inventories, CO 2 emissions are reduced by 25\u201332% relative to baseline by applying 15 technical and operational emission reduction measures in accordance with a ship-type-specific cost-effectiveness criterion, and 9 other emission compounds are changed as a technical implication of reducing CO 2 . The overall climate and environmental effects of the changes to all 10 emission components in the reduction inventory are assessed using a chemical transport model, radiative forcing (RF) models and a simple climate model. We find substantial environmental and health benefits with up to 5% reduction in surface ozone levels, 15% reductions in surface sulfate and 10% reductions in wet deposition of sulfate in certain regions exposed to heavy ship traffic. The major ship types show distinctly different contributions in specific locations. For instance, the container fleet contributes 50% of the sulfate decline on the west coast of North America. The global radiative forcing from a 1 yr emission equal to the difference between baseline and reduction inventory shows an initial strong positive forcing from non-CO 2 compounds. This warming effect is due to reduced cooling by aerosols and methane. After approximately 25 yr, the non-CO 2 forcing is balanced by the CO 2 forcing. For the global mean temperature change, we find a shift from warming to cooling after approximately 60 yr. The major ship types show significant differences in the short-term radiative forcing. For instance, the direct SO 4 forcing from tankers is 30% higher than for container and bulk. The net long-term effects on RF are similar due to similar CO 2 forcing. We assess an emission scenario where the reduction inventory is sustained on the fleet as it steadily diminishes over time due to scrapping and disappears in 2040. We find a net temperature increase lasting until approximately 2080. We conclude that changes in non-CO 2 emission does matter significantly if reductions of CO 2 emissions are made on the year 2010 cargo shipping fleet. In sum, we find that emission changes motivated by CO 2 reductions in shipping will be beneficial from a long-term climate perspective, and that there are positive environmental and health effects identified as concentrations of key short-lived pollutants are reduced.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "fd2a426a030538164781e7b21210f023efa538be", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2019529696", "DOI": "10.1029/2003GL018458", "CorpusId": 128542881}, "title": "Offsetting the radiative benefit of ocean iron fertilization by enhancing N2O emissions", "abstract": "Ocean iron fertilization is being considered as a strategy for mitigating the buildup of anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere.

This feedback could offset the radiative benefit from the atmospheric CO2 reduction significantly, because N2O is a much more powerful greenhouse gas than CO2 itself. Our model results show that the magnitude of this offsetting effect is substantial, but is highly dependent on the location and duration of fertilization. We find the largest offsets (of the order of 100%) when fertilization is undertaken in the tropics, particularly when it is of limited duration and size.

The exploration of the impacts relating to this shift and subsequent change in scope is explored in relation to the life cycle profile of a typical smartphone.MethodsA literature study is conducted into the existing literature in order to define the characteristics of a \u201ctypical\u201d smartphone. Focus is given to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in different life cycle phases in line with that reported in the majority of literature. Usage patterns from literature are presented in order to show how a smartphone is increasingly responsible for not only data consumption but also data generation. The subsequent consequences of this for the balance of the life cycle phases are explored with the inclusion of wider elements in the potential expanded mobile infrastructure, such as servers and the network.Results and discussionFrom the available literature, the manufacturing phase is shown to dominate the life cycle of a \u201ctypical\u201d smartphone for GHG emissions.

In the first one the author analyses the formation of the international regime on climate change since the negotiations and signing of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Rio de Janeiro, 1992), passing through the negotiations and signing of the Kyoto Protocol (1997), till the conclusion of the Protocol pending issues in the 7th Conference of the Parts in Marrakech (2001). In the second part the author analyses the public policies related to carbon emissions in Brazil during the 1990s and the Brazilian standing in the climate-changing regime. The Brazilian standing in the negotiations of the Kyoto Protocol (1996-2001) was a combination of leadership and defensive positions: the proposal of the Clean Development Fund, opposition to commitments for the reduction of future growth rates in carbon emissions for emerging countries, initial opposition to the inclusion of market mechanisms for emissions reduction, and opposition to the inclusion of emissions derived from land use changes in the Protocol. In the third part the author analyses the future perspectives of the Kyoto Protocol after the Agreements in Bonn and Marrakech, particularly in relation to its long-term viability without the re-entering of the United States.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "375500048f97abfb58352f5b2f6b88c268954592", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2103656156", "DOI": "10.1175/JCLI-D-12-00573.1", "CorpusId": 31666897}, "title": "A Multimodel Assessment of Future Projections of North Atlantic and European Extratropical Cyclones in the CMIP5 Climate Models", "abstract": "AbstractThe response of North Atlantic and European extratropical cyclones to climate change is investigated in the climate models participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). In contrast to previous multimodel studies, a feature-tracking algorithm is here applied to separately quantify the responses in the number, the wind intensity, and the precipitation intensity of extratropical cyclones. Moreover, a statistical framework is employed to formally assess the uncertainties in the multimodel projections. Under the midrange representative concentration pathway (RCP4.5) emission scenario, the December\u2013February (DJF) response is characterized by a tripolar pattern over Europe, with an increase in the number of cyclones in central Europe and a decreased number in the Norwegian and Mediterranean Seas. The June\u2013August (JJA) response is characterized by a reduction in the number of North Atlantic cyclones along the southern flank of the storm track.

This article presents a methodology for creating anthropogenic emission inventories that can be used to simulate future regional air quality. The Emission Scenario Projection (ESP) methodology focuses on energy production and use, the principal sources of many air pollutants. Emission growth factors for energy system categories are calculated using the MARKAL energy system model. Growth factors for non-energy sectors are based on economic and population projections. These factors are used to grow a 2005 emissions inventory through 2050. The approach is demonstrated for two emission scenarios for the United States. Scenario 1 extends current air regulations through 2050, while Scenario 2 adds a hypothetical CO2 mitigation policy. Although both scenarios show significant reductions in air pollutant emissions through time, these reductions are more pronounced in Scenario 2, where the CO2 policy results in the adoption of technologies with lower emissions of both CO2 and traditional air pollutants. The methodology is expected to play an important role within an integrated modeling framework that supports the US EPA's investigations of linkages among emission drivers, climate and air quality.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "ca3b8b183a4b932dc38cba8757081c758a2f3015", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2470196381", "DOI": "10.2791/843461", "CorpusId": 156868256}, "title": "An economic assessment of GHG mitigation policy options for EU agriculture (EcAMPA 2)", "abstract": "The project 'Economic Assessment of GHG mitigation policy options for EU agriculture (EcAMPA)' is designed to assess some aspects of a potential inclusion of the agricultural sector into the EU 2030 climate policy framework.

Although significant spectral reduction was achieved in the adjacent channel, the out-of-band spectral floor was flat and approximately -50 dB from the inband spectra. The complex gain predistorter exhibits two distinct advantages: a design engineer is not forced to back off a power amplifier to its linear but highly inefficient operating point; and adaptive correction allows the effects of frequency changes, drift in bias, operating point, aging and thermal stress to be readily compensated.<<ETX>>", "year": 1992}, {"paperId": "725d9d4bdaa38ed626645b81007ce8b6cd685a41", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/tim/ZhouPZL11", "MAG": "2139730649", "DOI": "10.1109/TIM.2010.2050974", "CorpusId": 13609932}, "title": "Tool Wear Monitoring Using Acoustic Emissions by Dominant-Feature Identification", "abstract": "Identification and online prediction of lifetime of cutting tools using cheap sensors is crucial to reduce production costs and downtime in industrial machines. In this paper, we use the acoustic emission from an embedded sensor for computation of features and prediction of tool wear. Acoustic sensors are cheap and nonintrusive, coupled with fast dynamic responses as compared with conventional force measurements using dynamometers. A reduced feature subset, which is optimal in both estimation and clustering least squares errors, is then selected using a new dominant-feature identification algorithm to reduce the signal processing and number of sensors required. Tool wear is then predicted using an Auto-Regressive Moving Average with eXogenous inputs model based on the reduced features. Our experimental results on a ball nose cutter in a high-speed milling machine show the effectiveness in predicting the tool wear using only the dominant features.

Published anthropogenic emissions inventories are disaggregated by gas, sector, country, or final energy form. This allows the assessment of novel energy supply options, but is insufficient for understanding how options for efficiency and demand reduction interact. A consistent framework for understanding the drivers of emissions is therefore developed, with a set of seven complete inventories reflecting all technical options for mitigation connected through lossless allocation matrices. The required data set is compiled and calculated from a wide range of industry, government, and academic reports. The framework is used to create a global Sankey diagram to relate human demand for services to anthropogenic emissions. The application of this framework is demonstrated through a prediction of per-capita emissions based on service demand in different countries, and through an example showing how the \u201ctechnical potentials\u201d of a set of separate mitigation options should be combined.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "618ab2d218d258f5db8fe9e2a1c306caf1a08048", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2054318438", "DOI": "10.1038/369139A0", "CorpusId": 4247301}, "title": "Removal of NO from flue gases by absorption to an iron(ii) thiochelate complex and subsequent reduction to ammonia", "abstract": "THE combustion of fossil fuels generates SO2 and NOX pollutants which cause acid rain and urban smog1.

To circumvent the need for separate schemes to control SO2 and NOX, we have developed an iron(ii) thiochelate complex that enhances the solubility of NO in aqueous solution by rapidly and efficiently absorbing NO to form iron nitrosyl complexes. The bound NO is then converted to ammonia by electrochemical reduction, regenerating the active iron(ii) catalyst for continued NO capture.

High-resolution single photon emission computed tomographic scanning was performed 21 hours after the intravenous administration of approximately 5 mCi of IQNB. In normal subjects, the images of retained ligand showed a consistent regional pattern that correlated with postmortem studies of the relative distribution of muscarinic receptors in the normal human brain, having high radioactivity counts in the basal ganglia, occipital cortex, and insular cortex, low counts in the thalamus, and virtually no counts in the cerebellum. Eight of 12 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease had obvious focal cortical defects in either frontal or posterior temporal cortex. Both patients with a clinical diagnosis of Pick's disease had obvious frontal and anterior temporal defects. A region of interest statistical analysis of relative regional activity revealed a significant reduction bilaterally in the posterior temporal cortex of the patients with Alzheimer's disease compared with controls. This study demonstrates the practicability of acetylcholine receptor imaging with 123IQNB and single photon emission computed tomography. The data suggest that focal abnormalities in muscarinic binding in vivo may characterize some patients with Alzheimer's disease and Pick's disease, but further studies are needed to address questions about partial volume artifacts and receptor quantification.", "year": 1991}]}
