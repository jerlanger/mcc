There has been limited destination-focused quantitative analysis of how tourism might be reshaped to reduce these emissions. This paper uses an extended tourism environmental satellite account methodology to examine the case of tourism in Wales, a United Kingdom region. It shows how an estimate of the emissions associated with trips to, and in, the region \u2013 internally, from the rest of the UK and from abroad \u2013 can contribute to regional aspirations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis suggests that substantial emissions cuts are dependent upon technical developments outside of tourism itself. Four potential scenarios are devised and analysed. Scenario 1 shows the value of low carbon electricity production in cutting tourism-related emissions. Scenario 2 analyses a possible 50% fall in international arrivals and 10% increase in UK domestic arrivals \u2013 maintaining employment but reducing emissions. Scenario 3 shows the effects of switch from private to public transport modes for 50% of UK resident arrivals.

For years, in thermionic emission, a great deal of effort has been devoted to the search for low work function materials with high melting temperature, while reduction of the local change in time of the work function rather than the work function itself has been the main issue of field emission investigations. High brightness and long life are the central targets of emission material investigations for scientific instrument applications, while high current density and low power consumption are the guiding principles for display applications.In most of the present day industries, thermionic emission materials are exclusively used in such fields requiring high current and high reliability as cathode ray tubes, transmission and receiving tubes, x-ray sources and various electron beam machines. Field electron emission sources, however, since applied to high resolution electron microscopes in the 1970s have recently become dominant in research and development in the fields of scientific instruments as well as in the fields of various electron tubes and beam machines.The main issue in this report is to analyse the work function on the atomic scale and thereby to understand the fundamental physics behind the work function, the change in time of the local work function leading to field emission current fluctuation and the relationship between microscopic (on atomic scale) and macroscopic work functions.Our attempt is presented here, where the work function on the atomic scale is measured by utilizing a scanning tunnelling microscopy technique, and it is made clear how far the local work function extends its influence over neighbouring sites.

It should be possible to meet increasing demands for food using existing and new technologies although this may not be easily or cheaply accomplished. The alleviation of hunger depends on food accessibility as well as food availability. Modern civilizations also require energy. This article presents the vision for bioenergy in terms of four major gains for society: a reduction in C emissions from the substitution of fossil fuels with appropriate energy crops; a significant contribution to energy security by reductions in fossil fuel dependence, for example, to meet government targets; new options that stimulate rural and urban economic development, and reduced dependence of global agriculture on fossil fuels. This vision is likely to be best fulfilled by the use of dedicated perennial bioenergy crops. We outline a number of factors that need to be taken into account in estimating the land area available for bioenergy. In terms of provisioning services, the value of biofuels is estimated at $54.7\u2012$330 bn per year at a crude oil price of $100 per barrel. In terms of regulatory services, the value of carbon emissions saved is estimated at $56\u2012$218 bn at a carbon price of $40 per tonne. Although global government subsidies for biofuels have been estimated at $20 bn (IEA, 2010b), these are dwarfed by subsidies for fossil fuel consumption ($312 bn; IEA, 2010b) and by total agricultural support for food and commodity crops ($383.7 bn in 2009; OECD, 2010).", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a4e85b90db028e819a3cd08e259e80adf778e695", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2341881653", "DOI": "10.3141/2570-06", "CorpusId": 113173370}, "title": "Assessment of the Carbon Footprint Reductions of Tricycle Logistics Services", "abstract": "This research assessed the greenhouse gas emissions of a tricycle logistics company (B-Line) that is providing last-mile distribution services in downtown Portland, Oregon.

Credits are earned by storing carbon in terrestrial ecosystems and wood products, although CO2 emissions are also mitigated by delaying deforestation, which accounts for one-quarter of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. However, non-permanent carbon offsets from biological activities are difficult to compare with each other and with emissions reduction because they differ in how long they prevent CO2 from entering the atmosphere. This is the duration problem. It results in uncertainty and makes it hard to determine the legitimacy of biological activities in mitigating climate change. Measuring, verifying and monitoring the carbon sequestered in sinks greatly increases transaction costs and leads to rent seeking by sellers of dubious sink credits. While biological sink activities undoubtedly help mitigate climate change and should not be neglected, it is shown that there are limits to the substitutability between temporary offset credits from these activities and emissions reduction, and that this has implications for carbon trading.

We aimed to determine the metabolic response rate to vemurafenib in patients with advanced BRAF-mutant melanoma.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nBaseline and day 15 FDG-PET was evaluated in 31 patients with advanced melanoma treated in a phase I study of dose escalation of vemurafenib (PLX06-02), which included four patients treated at subtherapeutic doses and 24 patients treated at 960 mg twice a day, which is the maximum-tolerated dose of vemurafenib.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAll 27 patients treated at potentially therapeutic levels had at least a partial metabolic response, and three patients achieved a complete metabolic response. In the 27 patients, there was an 80% \u00b1 3% reduction in the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of target lesions and an 87% \u00b1 3% decrease in the percentage of injected dose (%ID) in all identified disease sites. There was a positive correlation between %ID in all identified disease and target-lesion SUVmax (r(2) = 0.66; P < .001) that indicated a significant homogeneity of the response between lesions in individual patients. Although no relationship was found between the reduction in target lesion SUVmax and best response according to RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors), there was a trend for patients with greater reductions in uptake of FDG to have longer progression-free survival.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nFDG-PET is a useful marker of an early biologic response to vemurafenib. Little variability in PET response was found between lesions in individual patients, which suggested minimal intrapatient molecular heterogeneity. FDG-PET is a useful tool for the evaluation of the biologic impact of inhibiting mutant BRAF and may allow for the more effective development of novel agents.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "e803f75fb62caa7b79d1b9f8cbf47b064556509a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2059413006", "DOI": "10.1051/agro/2009031", "CorpusId": 41576121}, "title": "Greenhouse gases and ammonia emissions from organic mixed crop-dairy systems: a critical review of mitigation options", "abstract": "Dairy production systems represent a significant source of air pollutants such as greenhouse gases (GHG), that increase global warming, and ammonia (NH3), that leads to eutrophication and acidification of natural ecosystems. Greenhouse gases and ammonia are emitted both by conventional and organic dairy systems. Several studies have already been conducted to design practices that reduce greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions from dairy systems. However, those studies did not consider options specifically applied to organic farming, as well as the multiple trade-offs occurring between these air pollutants. This article reviews agricultural practices that mitigate greenhouse gas and ammonia emissions. Those practices can be applied to the most common organic dairy systems in northern Europe such as organic mixed crop-dairy systems. The following major points of mitigation options for animal production, crop production and grasslands are discussed. Animal production: the most promising options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the livestock management level involve either the improvement of animal production through dietary changes and genetic improvement or the reduction of the replacement rate. The control of the protein intake of animals is an effective means to reduce gaseous emissions of nitrogen, but it is difficult to implement in organic dairy farming systems. Considering the manure handling chain, mitigation options involve housing, storage and application. For housing, an increase in the amounts of straw used for bedding reduces NH3 emissions, while the limitation of CH4 emissions from deep litter is achieved by avoiding anaerobic conditions. During the storage of solid manure, composting could be an efficient mitigation option, depending on its management. Addition of straw to solid manure was shown to reduce CH4 and N2O emissions from the manure heaps. During the storage of liquid manure, emptying the slurry store before late spring is an efficient mitigation option to limit both CH4 and NH3 emissions. Addition of a wooden cover also reduces these emissions more efficiently than a natural surface crust alone, but may increase N2O emissions. Anaerobic digestion is the most promising way to reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions from storage and land spreading, without increasing NH3 emissions. At the application stage, NH3 emissions may be reduced by spreading manure during the coolest part of the day, incorporating it quickly and in narrow bands. Crop production: the mitigation options for crop production focus on limiting CO2 and N2O emissions. The introduction of perennial crops or temporary leys of longer duration are promising options to limit CO2 emissions by storing carbon in plants or soils. Reduced tillage or no tillage as well as the incorporation of crop residues also favour carbon sequestration in soils, but these practices may enhance N2O emissions. Besides, the improvement of crop N-use efficiency through effective management of manure and slurry, by growing catch crops or by delaying the ploughing of leys, is of prime importance to reduce N2O emissions. Grassland: concerning grassland and grazing management, permanent conversion from arable to grassland provides high soil carbon sequestration while increasing or decreasing the livestock density seems not to be an appropriate mitigation option. From the study of the multiple interrelations between gases and between farm compartments, the following mitigation options are advised for organic mixed crop-dairy systems: (1) actions for increasing energy efficiency or fuel savings because they are beneficial in any case, (2) techniques improving efficiency of N management at field and farm levels because they affect not only N2O and NH3 emissions, but also nitrate leaching, and (3) biogas production through anaerobic digestion of manure because it is a promising efficient method to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, even if the profitability of this expensive investment needs to be carefully studied. Finally, the way the farmer implements the mitigation options, i.e. his practices, will be a determining factor in the reduction of greenhouse gas and NH3 emissions.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "ab285bb4416acda47e501181a5fb85687d4b37cc", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.3763/cpol.2010.0093", "CorpusId": 219598680}, "title": "Carbon taxes: a review of experience and policy design considerations", "abstract": "State and local governments in the USA are evaluating a wide range of policies to reduce carbon emissions, including carbon taxes, which have existed internationally for nearly 20 years.

As one common precursor for both PM2.5 and O3 pollution,\nNOx gains great attention because its controls can be beneficial for\nreducing both PM2.5 and O3. However, the effectiveness of\nNOx controls for reducing PM2.5 and O3 are largely\ninfluenced by the ambient levels of NH3 and VOC, exhibiting strong\nnonlinearities characterized as NH3-limited/NH3-poor and\nNOx-/VOC-limited conditions, respectively. Quantification of such\nnonlinearities is a prerequisite for making suitable policy decisions but\nlimitations of existing methods were recognized. In this study, a new method\nwas developed by fitting multiple simulations of a chemical transport model\n(i.e., Community Multiscale Air Quality Modeling System, CMAQ) with a set\nof polynomial functions (denoted as \u201cpf-RSM\u201d) to quantify responses of\nambient PM2.5 and O3 concentrations to changes in precursor\nemissions. The accuracy of the pf-RSM is carefully examined to meet the\ncriteria of a mean normalized error within 2\u2009% and a maximal normalized\nerror within 10\u2009% by using 40 training samples with marginal\nprocessing. An advantage of the pf-RSM method is that the nonlinearity in\nPM2.5 and O3 responses to precursor emission changes can be\ncharacterized by quantitative indicators, including (1)\u00a0a peak ratio (denoted\nas PR) representing VOC-limited or NOx-limited conditions, (2)\u00a0a suggested\nratio of VOC reduction to NOx reduction to avoid increasing O3 under\nVOC-limited conditions, (3)\u00a0a flex ratio (denoted as FR) representing\nNH3-poor or NH3-rich conditions, and (4)\u00a0enhanced benefits in\nPM2.5 reductions from simultaneous reduction of NH3 with\nthe same reduction rate of NOx. A case study in the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei\nregion suggested that most urban areas present strong VOC-limited conditions\nwith a PR from 0.4 to 0.8 in July, implying that the NOx emission\nreduction rate needs to be greater than 20\u201360\u2009% to pass the transition from\nVOC-limited to NOx-limited conditions. A simultaneous VOC control (the ratio of VOC\nreduction to NOx reduction is about 0.5\u20131.2) can avoid increasing\nO3 during the transition. For PM2.5, most urban areas\npresent strong NH3-rich conditions with a PR from 0.75 to 0.95, implying\nthat NH3 is sufficiently abundant to neutralize extra nitric acid\nproduced by an additional 5\u201335\u2009% of NOx emissions.

Thus, the newly developed pf-RSM model has successfully\nquantified the enhanced effectiveness of NOx control, and simultaneous\nreduction of VOC and NH3 with NOx can assure the control\neffectiveness of PM2.5 and O3.\n", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "53367eb9d9a64fafb3f886776c1160be6324b4f0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "195508197", "CorpusId": 107277737}, "title": "Driving and the built environment : the effects of compact development on motorized travel, energy use, and CO2 emissions", "abstract": "S uburbanization is a longstanding trend reflecting the preference of many Americans for living in detached single-family homes.

Extensive series of experiments have led to the conclusions summarized in this paper. The increased emission is due to a layer of Th atoms absorbed on the surface of the tungsten. To form this layer, the thorium oxide which originally exists throughout the volume of the filament, must first be reduced in part, by heating for a few seconds to between 2600\\ifmmode^\\circ\\else\\textdegree\\fi{} and 2800\\ifmmode^\\circ\\else\\textdegree\\fi{} K; then, by heating for some time at a suitable activating temperature ${T}_{a}$ = 2000\\ifmmode^\\circ\\else\\textdegree\\fi{} to 2100\\ifmmode^\\circ\\else\\textdegree\\fi{} K, some of the Th atoms are brought to the surface by diffusing faster than they evaporate, the fraction of the surface covered $\\ensuremath{\\theta}$, increasing to a limit ${\\ensuremath{\\theta}}_{\\ensuremath{\\infty}}$ which may or may not be 1. The activity determined at a lower testing temperature ${T}_{t}={1400}^{\\ensuremath{\\circ}} \\mathrm{to} {1500}^{\\ensuremath{\\circ}}$ K, increases logarithmically with $\\ensuremath{\\theta}$; for any filament it remains constant provided the filament is not heated above 1900\\ifmmode^\\circ\\else\\textdegree\\fi{} K and the film is not allowed to be oxidized. It is evident that the rate of activation $\\frac{d\\ensuremath{\\theta}}{\\mathrm{dt}}$ depends directly on the difference between the rate of diffusion to the surface and the rate of evaporation from the surface. Rate of diffusion of Th atoms to the surface is $\\mathrm{DG}$ where $G$ is the concentration gradient (atoms per ${\\mathrm{cm}}^{4}$) of Th atoms near the surface, and $D$ is the coefficient of diffusion. If ${N}_{0}$ is the number of Th atoms per unit area for a saturated film, it seems probable, from the crystal structures of Th and W, that ${N}_{0}$ is only half the number of tungsten atoms in the surface; and making correction for the increased surface due to the dodecahedral structure (6 per cent), ${\\mathrm{N}}_{0}$ is taken as 0.756\\ifmmode\\times\\else\\texttimes\\fi{}${10}^{15}$. A mathematical analysis of the experimental results gives for the absolute value of $D$ (${\\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$ per sec.): ${log}_{10}\\mathrm{D}=.044\\ensuremath{-}\\frac{20540}{T}$, in agreement with a theoretical expression given by Dushman and Langmuir. Rate of normal evaporation of Th atoms from a partly covered tungsten surface ($\\ensuremath{\\theta}=.2 \\mathrm{to} .8$) in atoms per ${\\mathrm{cm}}^{2}$ per sec. is given by: ${log}_{10}{E}_{\\mathrm{nm}}=31.43\\ensuremath{-}\\frac{44500}{T}$. As the surface covered decreases below.2, ${E}_{n}$ decreases but not as fast as $\\ensuremath{\\theta}$, while for values of $\\ensuremath{\\theta}$ above.8, ${E}_{n}$ increases to a value three times ${E}_{\\mathrm{nm}}$. The small variation of ${E}_{n}$ with $\\ensuremath{\\theta}$ shows that the effect of adjacent Th atoms is small. Studies of the effect of prolonged activation of filaments indicate that the surface film is never more than one atom thick. Since the atoms do not diffuse back into the tungsten, we must suppose that when a Th atom diffusing to the surface arrives below another Th atom, one Th atom immediately evaporates. The rate of induced evaporation depends upon the diffusion and upon $\\ensuremath{\\theta}$, experiments showing that ${E}_{i}=DG(0.82\\ensuremath{\\theta}+.18{\\ensuremath{\\theta}}^{3})$. The rate of activation is, then, given by: $\\frac{{N}_{0}d\\ensuremath{\\theta}}{\\mathrm{dt}}=DG\\ensuremath{-}{E}_{n}\\ensuremath{-}{E}_{i}=DG(1\\ensuremath{-}0.82\\ensuremath{\\theta}\\ensuremath{-}.18{\\ensuremath{\\theta}}^{3})\\ensuremath{-}{E}_{n}$. The experimental curves, however, correspond almost equally well to the simple expression: $\\frac{d\\ensuremath{\\theta}}{\\mathrm{dt}}=k({\\ensuremath{\\theta}}_{\\ensuremath{\\infty}}\\ensuremath{-}\\ensuremath{\\theta})$, when ${\\ensuremath{\\theta}}_{\\ensuremath{\\infty}}$ is the limiting value, at which the diffusion and evaporation are balanced. Deactivation occurs when the evaporation exceeds the diffusion. The concentration gradient $G$ depends, of course, on the previous history of the filament, especially the preliminary reduction of thoria at a high temperature. The rate of reduction of thoria is given by: ${log}_{10}{p}_{r}=27.98\\ensuremath{-}\\frac{30160}{T}$, where ${p}_{r}$ is the number of atoms of thorium produced per sec. per ${\\mathrm{cm}}^{3}$; the limiting concentration gradient (atoms per ${\\mathrm{cm}}^{4}$) reached is given by: ${log}_{10}{G}_{r}=25.22\\ensuremath{-}\\frac{9620}{T}$, the actual concentrations of thorium in parts per million by weight varying from 1.4 to 200 for temperatures of 1800\\ifmmode^\\circ\\else\\textdegree\\fi{} to 3000\\ifmmode^\\circ\\else\\textdegree\\fi{} K. Various properties of thoriated filaments in a steady state are summarized in Table VIII.Energy changes for atoms of thorium, per gram atom, computed from constants in the above equations are: (1) Heat of reduction of thoria in tungsten = -138,000 cal. (absorbed); (2) Heat of evaporation of Th from tungsten = 204,000 cal.; (3) Heat of diffusion of Th through tungsten: 94,000 cal.Crystal structure of tungsten and chromium.---Both are body-centered cubic and when etched show rhombic dodecahedron faces (110).

NR (purified or in crude extracts) in vitro produced NO at saturating NADH and nitrite concentrations at about 1% of its nitrate reduction capacity. The K(m) for nitrite was relatively high (100 microM) compared to nitrite concentrations in illuminated leaves (10 microM). NO production was competitively inhibited by physiological nitrate concentrations (K(i)=50 microM). Importantly, inactivation of NR in crude extracts by protein phosphorylation with MgATP in the presence of a protein phosphatase inhibitor also inhibited NO production. Nitrate-fertilized plants or leaves emitted NO into purified air. The NO emission was lower in the dark than in the light, but was generally only a small fraction of the total NR activity in the tissue (about 0.01-0.1%).

It is recognised that most people in the UK do not meet dietary recommendations and have diets with a high environmental impact, but changing dietary habits has proved very difficult. The purpose of this study was to investigate the diversity in dietary changes needed to achieve a healthy diet and a healthy diet with lower greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) (referred to as a sustainable diet) by taking into account each individual\u2019s current diet and then minimising the changes they need to make.MethodsLinear programming was used to construct two new diets for each adult in the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey (n\u2009=\u20091491) by minimising the changes to their current intake. Stepwise changes were applied until (i) dietary recommendations were achieved and (ii) dietary recommendations and a GHGE target were met. First, gradual changes (\u226450 %) were made to the amount of any foods currently eaten. Second, new foods were added to the diet. Third, greater reductions (\u226475 %) were made to the amount of any food currently eaten and finally, foods were removed from the diet.ResultsOne person out of 1491 in the sample met all the dietary requirements based on their reported dietary intake. Only 7.5 and 4.6 % of people achieved a healthy diet and a sustainable diet, respectively, by changing the amount of any food they currently ate by up to 50 %. The majority required changes to the amount of each food eaten plus the addition of new foods. Fewer than 5 % had to remove foods they ate to meet recommendations. Sodium proved the most difficult nutrient recommendation to meet. The healthy diets and sustainable diets produced a 15 and 27 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions respectively.ConclusionsSince healthy diets alone do not produce substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, dietary guidelines need to include recommendations for environmental sustainability.

To the extent that companies from these sectors (notably power producers) pass through the extra costs for carbon, higher prices for allowances translate into stronger incentives for the demand-side energy efficiency. With the cuts in allocation to energy and industry sectors, these will be forced to greater reductions; thus, the non-ET sectors like household, tertiary, and transport will have to reduce less, which is more in line with the cost-efficient share of emission reductions. The findings also imply that domestic efficiency improvements in the energy and industry sectors may remain limited since companies can make substantial use of credits from the Kyoto Mechanisms. The analysis of the rules for existing installations, new projects, and closures suggests that incentives for energy efficiency are higher in phase 2 than in phase 1 because of the increased application of benchmarking to new and existing installations and because a lower share of allowances will be allocated for free.

Retail industry marketers, as a component of their evolving animal care audit programs, are issuing guidelines for the control and reduction of ammonia within poultry facilities to address animal welfare concerns. At the same time, pressure is being placed on poultry producers from interested groups and neighbors to reduce ammonia emissions for environmental reasons. Since the current procedure for reducing ammonia levels in houses is to exhaust air as much as possible, this will, in some part, conflict with efforts to reduce ammonia emissions from poultry live production facilities. Research will be needed from the industry and academia to develop methods of reducing nitrogen excreted by poultry, e.g., research in nutrition, genetics, poultry husbandry, and management. Research is needed to improve or develop methods of manure management and treatment that will reduce ammonia emissions. Research is also needed in developing methods of closing the loop, using nitrogen in poultry manures to produce crops that can be fed back to poultry. Importing major quantities of feedstuffs from other regions of the country and depositing manure onto low-productivity pastures or cropland may not be sustainable.

Ljubljana marsh in Slovenia is a 16 000 ha area of partly drained fen, intended to be flooded to restore its ecological functions. The resultant water-logging may create anoxic conditions, eventually stimulating production and emission of methane, the most important greenhouse gas next to carbon dioxide. We examined the upper layer (~30 cm) of Ljubljana marsh soil for microbial processes that would predominate in water-saturated conditions, focusing on the potential for iron reduction, carbon mineralization (CO2 and CH4 production), and methane emission. Methane emission from water-saturated microcosms was near minimum detectable levels even after extended periods of flooding (>5 months). Methane production in anoxic soil slurries started only after a lag period of 84 d at 15\u00b0C and a minimum of 7 d at 37\u00b0C, the optimum temperature for methanogenesis. This lag was inversely related to iron reduction, which suggested that iron reduction out-competed methanogenesis for electron donors, such as H2 and acetate. Methane production was observed only in samples incubated at 14\u201338\u00b0C. At the beginning of methanogenesis, acetoclastic methanogenesis dominated. In accordance with the preferred substrate, most (91%) mcrA (encoding the methyl coenzyme-M reductase, a key gene in methanogenesis) clone sequences could be affiliated to the acetoclastic genus Methanosarcina. No methanogens were detected in the original soil. However, a diverse community of iron-reducing Geobacteraceae was found.

Carbon footprinting efforts typically aim to identify where best to invest in emission reduction efforts, and/or to determine the proportion of total emissions that an individual firm is accountable for, whether financially and/or operationally. A major and under-recognized challenge in determining the appropriate allocation stems from the high degree to which GHG emissions (or emissions reductions) are the result of joint efforts by multiple firms.In this paper we introduce a simple but effective model of joint production of GHG emissions in general supply chains, decomposing the total footprint into processes, each of which can be influenced by any combination of firms. A supply chain in which all firms exert their first-best emissions reduction effort levels is \u00e2\u0080\u009ccarbon optimal\u00e2\u0080\u009d, while a supply chain which offsets all emissions is \u00e2\u0080\u009ccarbon neutral\u00e2\u0080\u009d. With this structure, we examine conditions under which the supply chain can be carbon-neutral and/or carbon-optimal. We find that, in order to induce the carbon-optimal effort levels, the emissions need to be over-allocated. This means that the focus in the life-cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting literature on avoiding double-counting is, in the context of setting incentives, misguided. We also compare the situation where a single firm offsets all supply chain emissions with that where one powerful firm can enforce an emissions reduction target across all firms in the supply chain, and find that neither scenario is always preferred over the other.

While few would deny that agriculture is affected by climate change and that the right practices contribute to mitigate it, expectations of the Copenhagen agreement diverge sharply, as well as notions on what are good and what are bad agricultural practices and whether any funding should come from carbon trading, or a fund or both.. Many Annex I countries want to see (virtually) all funding to come from offsets, emissions trading and projects in Non-Annex 1 Countries (largely the South). In 2008 a record 4.9 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emission reductions were traded on global carbon markets, and carbon trading increased by 83 per cent in just one year, but this trading has not led to a reduction in emissions. Since the Kyoto Protocol came into force in 2005, global CO2 emissions have continued to increase. Carbon trading does nothing to prevent emissions from fossil fuel burning in the North and there is strong evidence that Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) credits are being used to subsidise some of the most polluting industries in the South. Not surprisingly therefore, carbon trading has not delivered emissions reductions. Few have realized that there are several agricultural methodologies under the CDM, and many projects exist, particularly in relation to pig farms and oil palm plantations. These are contested for many reasons such as biodiversity destruction and soil and water pollution.

The experiment employs ten global climate and Earth System models (GCMs and ESMs) and pioneers elements of the long-term experimental design for the forthcoming 5th Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessment. Atmospheric carbon-dioxide concentrations pathways rather than carbon emissions are specified in all models, including five ESMs that contain interactive carbon cycles. Specified forcings also include minor greenhouse gas concentration pathways, ozone concentration, aerosols (via concentrations or precursor emissions) and land use change (in five models). The new aggressive mitigation scenario (E1), constructed using an integrated assessment model (IMAGE\u00a02.4) with reduced fossil fuel use for energy production aimed at stabilizing global warming below 2\u00a0K, is studied alongside the medium-high non-mitigation scenario SRES A1B. Resulting twenty-first century global mean warming and precipitation changes for A1B are broadly consistent with previous studies. In E1 twenty-first century global warming remains below 2\u00a0K in most models, but global mean precipitation changes are higher than in A1B up to 2065 and consistently higher per degree of warming. The spread in global temperature and precipitation responses is partly attributable to inter-model variations in aerosol loading and representations of aerosol-related radiative forcing effects. Our study illustrates that the benefits of mitigation will not be realised in temperature terms until several decades after emissions reductions begin, and may vary considerably between regions. A subset of the models containing integrated carbon cycles agree that land and ocean sinks remove roughly half of present day anthropogenic carbon emissions from the atmosphere, and that anthropogenic carbon emissions must decrease by at least 50% by 2050 relative to 1990, with further large reductions needed beyond that to achieve the E1 concentrations pathway. Negative allowable anthropogenic carbon emissions at and beyond 2100 cannot be ruled out for the E1 scenario.

We also find variations in the cross-state contributions of different emission sectors and chemical species to premature mortality, and changes in these variations over time. Emissions from electric power generation have the greatest cross-state impacts as a fraction of their total impacts, whereas commercial/residential emissions have the smallest. However, reductions in emissions from electric power generation since 2005 have meant that, by 2018, cross-state premature mortality associated with the commercial/residential sector was twice that associated with power generation. In terms of the chemical species emitted, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide emissions caused the most cross-state premature deaths in 2005, but by 2018 primary PM 2.5 emissions led to cross-state premature deaths equal to three times those associated with sulfur dioxide emissions. These reported shifts in emission sectors and emission species that contribute to premature mortality may help to guide improvements to air quality in the contiguous United States.

Combustion technology can facilitate volume reduction of up to 90%, with the inorganic contaminants being captured in furnace bottom ash, and fly ash/APC residues. The disposal or reuse of these residues is however governed by the potential release of constituent contaminants into the environment. Accelerated carbonation has been shown to have a potential for improving the chemical stability and leaching behaviour of both bottom ash and fly ash/APC residues. However, the efficacy of carbonation depends on whether the method of gas application is direct or indirect. Also important are the mineralogy, chemistry and physical properties of the fresh ash, the carbonation reaction conditions such as temperature, contact time, CO2 partial pressure and relative humidity. This paper reviews the main issues pertaining to the application of accelerated carbonation to municipal waste combustion residues to elucidate the potential benefits on the stabilization of such residues and for reducing CO2 emissions. In particular, the modification of ash properties that occur upon carbonation and the CO2 sequestration potential possible under different conditions are discussed.

Weekend 1-hr or 8-hr maximum O3 varies from 15% lower than weekday levels to 30% higher. The weekend O3 increases are primarily found in and around large coastal cities in California and large cities in the Midwest and Northeast Corridor. Both the average and the 95th percentile of the daily 1-hr and 8-hr maxima exhibit the same general pattern. Many sites that have elevated O3 also have higher O3 on weekends even though traffic and O3 precursor levels are substantially reduced on weekends. Detailed studies of this phenomenon indicate that the primary cause of the higher O3 on weekends is the reduction in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions on weekends in a volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited chemical regime. In contrast, the lower O3 on weekends in other locations is probably a result of NOx reductions in a NOx-limited regime. The NOx reduction explanation is supported by a wide range of ambient analyses and several photochemical modeling studies. Changes in the timing and location of emissions and meteorological factors play smaller roles in weekend O3 behavior. Weekday/weekend temperature differences do not explain the weekend effect but may modify it.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "4fd1826628c273a7e11e6649298daaf1ad2ee8e2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2050742778", "DOI": "10.2202/1538-0653.1144", "CorpusId": 154834501}, "title": "What Determines Environmental Performance at Paper Mills?

Assuming, in a first step, that total surfactant production in the European Union remains constant until 2010, it was estimated that the amount of oleochemical surfactants could be increased from about 880 kilotons (kt) in 1998 to approximately 1, 100 kt in 2010 (an increase of 24%). This substitution reduces the life\u2010cycle CO2 emissions from surfactants by 8%; the theoretical maximum potential for total substitution is 37%. Because the surfactant market is expected to grow, the avoided emissions will probably exceed 8% of the current life\u2010cycle CO2 emissions from surfactants. If compared to the CO2 emissions from the total industrial sector and, even more so, if compared to the total economy, the relative savings are much lower (0.02% to 0.09%).

We then combine these estimates with detailed historical data to provide a model-driven decomposition of the causes of the observed pollution changes. Finally, we compare the model-driven decomposition to a statistical decomposition. The model and data suggest three findings. First, the fall in pollution emissions is due to decreasing pollution per unit output within narrowly defined products, rather than to changes in the types of products produced or changes to the total quantity of manufacturing output. Second, the implicit pollution tax that rationalizes firm production and abatement behavior more than doubled between 1990 and 2008.

It was \"born\" as a wastewater treatment system, in the 1970s showed promise as an alternative energy source (in particular from animal waste), in the 1980s and later it became a standard for treating organic-matter-rich industrial wastewater, and more recently returned to the market for its energy recovery potential, making use of different biomasses, including energy crops. With the growing concern around global warming, this paper looks at the potential of anaerobic digestion in terms of reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The potential contribution of anaerobic digestion to GHG reduction has been computed for the 27 EU countries on the basis of their 2005 Kyoto declarations and using life cycle data. The theoretical potential contribution of anaerobic digestion to Kyoto and EU post-Kyoto targets has been calculated. Two different possible biogas applications have been considered: electricity production from manure waste, and upgraded methane production for light goods vehicles (from landfill biogas and municipal and industrial wastewater treatment sludges). The useful heat that can be produced as by-product from biogas conversion into electricity has not been taken into consideration, as its real exploitation depends on local conditions. Moreover the amount of biogas already produced via dedicated anaerobic digestion processes has also not been included in the calculations. Therefore the overall gains achievable would be even higher than those reported here. This exercise shows that biogas may considerably contribute to GHG emission reductions in particular if used as a biofuel. Results also show that its use as a biofuel may allow for true negative GHG emissions, showing a net advantage with respect to other biofuels. Considering also energy crops that will become available in the next few years as a result of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, this study shows that biogas has the potential of covering almost 50% of the 2020 biofuel target of 10% of all automotive transport fuels, without implying a change in land use. Moreover, considering the achievable GHG reductions, a very large carbon emission trading \"value\" could support the investment needs.However, those results were obtained through a \"qualitative\" assessment.

Experiments were conducted with BD blend amounts of 10%, 20%, and 30% on a volume basis under various engine speeds. As the BD blend ratio increased, the combustion pressure and indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) decreased slightly at the low engine speed of 1500 rpm, while they increased at the middle engine speed of 2500 rpm. The brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increased at all engine speeds while the carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM) emissions were considerably reduced. On the other hand, the nitrogen oxide (NO x ) emissions only increased slightly. When increasing the BD blend ratio at an engine speed of 2000 rpm with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates of 0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%, the combustion pressure and IMEP tended to decrease. The CO and PM emissions decreased in proportion to the BD blend ratio. Also, the NO x emissions decreased considerably as the EGR rate increased whereas the BD blend ratio only slightly influenced the NO x emissions.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "a1c3d5da2cec57cf38360e961477c00206212e82", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2042507595", "DOI": "10.2355/ISIJINTERNATIONAL.51.1301", "CorpusId": 131765897}, "title": "Future Steelmaking Model by Direct Reduction Technologies", "abstract": "Steel production requires iron ore and coal, and accompanies greenhouse gas emissions. The annual production of the world crude steel increased from 0.9 to 1.3 billion tonnes since 2002, and is anticipated to increase due to the continuous economic growth in developing countries especially in Asia.About two thirds of the crude steel is produced by BF\u2013BOF route whose ratio in the total crude steel production has gradually been increasing. The BF\u2013BOF process is an excellent process in terms of productivity and energy efficiency, the process, however requires high grade iron ore and coal, and the large steel production by the BF\u2013BOF route will accelerate the exhaustion of the high grade raw materials. The CO2 emissions are also anticipated to increase as does the steel production, since approximately 2 tonnes of CO2 is generated per tonne of steel by the BF\u2013BOF process.On the other hand, world in-use steel stock has been increasing year by year due to the continuous large steel production, and will be recycled as a large amount of scrap to the market in the future.Steelmaking by feeding Iron Nuggets to EAF together with the scrap can significantly decrease the CO2 emissions while satisfying the steel quality by diluting the impurities containing in the scrap, as well as conserving the natural resources of high grade iron ore and coal. Steel production by using the direct reduction processes together with the scrap is a suitable and reasonable solution for a sustainable iron and steel making.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "3fbd6b51da1fdbe5cae4cc834baa93deb255c01d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2799587911", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/AABE9D", "CorpusId": 158959599}, "title": "Assessing the evolution of power sector carbon intensity in the United States", "abstract": "In the United States, the electricity sector is a major focus for implementing policies to meet national, state, or local mandatory or voluntary CO2 emissions reductions goals. Thus, it is important to have timely and available information on greenhouse gas emissions generated by the power sector to ensure that the policies implemented achieve intended emissions reductions. This work is the first to develop a transparent method to compute the emissions intensity for the US electricity section from 2001 through 2017 at different temporal (annual, quarterly, monthly) and regional (US, NERC, and state) levels. We find that between 2001 and 2017 the average annual CO2 emissions intensity of electricity production in the United States decreased by 30%, from 630 g CO2 kWh\u22121 to 439 g CO2 kWh\u22121. This change in CO2 intensity is attributable to an increase in generation from natural gas and wind accompanied by a reduction in coal-fired power generation. The decline in carbon intensity varies across regions, with the largest reduction between 2001 and 2017 from power plants in the Northeast (58%) and the smallest reduction from power plants in the Texas region (27%). In absolute terms the South-central region saw the largest decrease in emissions intensity (358 g CO2 kWh\u22121) and Texas saw the smallest (164 g CO2 kWh\u22121). We also find that replacing coal generation with natural gas or renewables has increased the monthly correlation of CO2 intensity between regions. At the state level, Delaware saw the largest decrease in CO2 intensity (466 g CO2 kWh\u22121), and Idaho is the only state that has not decreased CO2 intensity since 2001.", "year": 2018}]}
