Methane was formed at all of the sites, at rates 2 orders of magnitude lower than sulphate reduction, and was greatest at a site on the marsh top site where organic matter was high. Methane emissions to the atmosphere were substantially lower than sedimentary methanogenesis, suggesting methane oxida- tion occurred in the sediments before emission, with the proportion oxidized before emission increas- ing down the estuary.

China\u2019s grain production increased by 74% between 1982 and 2017, while chemical fertilizer use tripled over the same period4. The average nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) for crop production in China is approximately 0.25 (ref. 5), indicating substantial reactive nitrogen (Nr) losses to the environment. The losses include ammonia (NH3) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, which contribute to health-damaging PM2.5 (fine particles with aerodynamic diameters of <2.5 \u03bcm) air pollution and global warming, respectively, as well as NO3 and organic N leaching and runoff, which contaminate drinking water and cause eutrophication5,6. As the world\u2019s largest meat and egg producer7, China also contributes approximately 25% of global manure N production8,9. Only one-third of manure N annually produced in China is utilized by crops or stored in the soil, with two-thirds released as environmental pollution8. Chinese policymakers increasingly recognize the interconnections between air and water pollution, climate change, low NUE and China\u2019s poor agricultural N management practices. Facing severe PM2.5 air pollution10\u201312, previous policies in China have focused on controlling point sources, without attention paid to dispersed agricultural sources. However, it is now known that controlling agricultural NH3 emissions is effective for PM2.5 mitigation when gaseous NH3 limits the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs) ([S IA] = [NH4] + [NO3] + [SO4]), which has been reported in winter in the eastern United States13, Europe14,15 and China\u2019s Pearl River Delta16, and in summer in Europe15. China\u2019s Three-Year Action Plan to Win the Battle for a Blue Sky17, enacted in 2018 for the first time, encourages NH3 emission reductions, although no quantitative target has been specified. NH3 emission reductions must be achieved through improved synchronization between N supply and crop demand and improved manure N utilization. Furthermore, such improvements increase crop yields and NUE, as well as decreasing N2O and NO3 leaching and runoff18. The government has set several policy measures for improving food security and NUE, which are viewed as separate efforts from air pollution policies, including: zero N fertilizer use increase by 202019; an action plan for converting animal manure to nutrients (2017\u20132020)20; a plan for 75% of livestock and poultry waste to be disposed of with no harm to the environment17; and a tightened regulatory standard for the discharge of animal waste to rivers that has been drafted for public review21.

Reductions are compared with a baseline that already accounts for implementation of clean vehicle standards. The greatest global emission reductions from a scrappage program occur 5 to 10 years after its introduction and can reach as much as 70%.

Gas has received a lot of attention as a transition fuel. This Climate Council submission to the NEM Security Review, therefore, focuses on whether gas-powered electricity generation has a role to play toward Australia reducing its emissions and meeting its Paris Agreement commitments. Human activities, such as the burning of coal, oil and gas for electricity, are driving up greenhouse gas emissions and a long-term warming trend. Consequently, climate change is cranking up the intensity of extreme weather events in Australia, such as heatwaves, bushfires and coastal flooding. The impacts of extreme weather events will likely become much worse unless global greenhouse gas emissions are reduced rapidly and deeply. In ratifying the Paris Agreement, Australia committed to rapidly reduce our carbon emissions, transitioning to zero emissions before 2050. Despite this pledge to tackle climate change, Australia\u2019s emissions continue to rise, particularly from its largest source \u2013 the electricity sector. Furthermore, while some have argued that additional gas resource development is essential to transition to a low carbon electricity generation system, this will not be possible within the 2oC carbon budget - because tackling climate change requires that most of the world\u2019s (including Australia\u2019s) fossil fuels be left in the ground, unburned. Additionally, building new gas power plants and infrastructure based on policy schemes which foster new gas development, risk \u201clocking-in\u201d expanded gas use for decades into the future, and dramatic expansion of new unconventional gas resource exploration and development, and associated fossil fuel delivery infrastructure. The fundamentals of the current electricity industry rule making and governance structure must change to bring the industry into the 21st century. The Paris Agreement and global carbon budget means that a fourth objective must be included as an overarching objective for the National Electricity Market \u2013 that being an essential requirement that all rule making, governance and operations must be consistent with the sector achieving, at a minimum, its proportionate share of national emission reduction commitments under the Paris Agreement. To protect Australians from worsening climate impacts (eg more destructive storms, intense heatwaves and worsening bushfire conditions) and in line with our Paris Agreement commitments and carbon budget constraints, Australia needs pathways to transition as rapidly as possible away from coal, oil and gas to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Developing new gas (and other fossil fuel) projects is fundamentally at odds with attaining this goal.

The global aerosol\u2013climate model ECHAM-HAMMOZ was used to investigate changes in the aerosol burden and aerosol radiative effects in the coming decades. Four different emissions scenarios were applied for 2030 (two of them applied also for 2020) and the results were compared against the reference year 2005. Two of the scenarios are based on current legislation reductions: one shows the maximum potential of reductions that can be achieved by technical measures, and the other is targeted to short-lived climate forcers (SLCFs). We have analyzed the results in terms of global means and additionally focused on eight subregions. Based on our results, aerosol burdens show an overall decreasing trend as they basically follow the changes in primary and precursor emissions. However, in some locations, such as India, the burdens could increase significantly. The declining emissions have an impact on the clear-sky direct aerosol effect (DRE), i.e. the cooling effect. The DRE could decrease globally 0.06\u20130.4 W m\u22122 by 2030 with some regional increases, for example, over India (up to 0.84 W m\u22122). The global changes in the DRE depend on the scenario and are smallest in the targeted SLCF simulation. The aerosol indirect radiative effect could decline 0.25\u20130.82 W m\u22122 by 2030. This decrease takes place mostly over the oceans, whereas the DRE changes are greatest over the continents.

In 20 years the excretion of P in growing-finishing pigs has more than halved. Ammonia emission from manure of pigs can be reduced substantially by lowering dietary protein content, but also by including additional non-starch polysaccharides in the diet. A very promising method to reduce ammonia emission is to manipulate dietary cation-anion difference, e.g. by adding acidifying salts to the diet, which will lower pH of urine substantially.

An illustrative analysis investigates how changes in the geographic distribution of production could contribute to reducing global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and at what cost.

Tests combining these two techniques were carried out on a single-cylinder research engine (SCRE) based on a modified heavy-duty automotive engine. No attempt was made to optimize the engine's combustion chamber or the injector geometry for EGR operation. The SCRE's independent charge-air system allowed for more controlled testing over a wider range of test variables than can be carried out by a standard engine. These tests investigated the effects of cooled EGR on particulate matter (PM) and NOX emissions while varying the injection timing, engine speed, equivalence ratio and intake manifold pressure. The results suggested that, with EGR, higher equivalence ratios reduced power-specific NOX but increased PM emissions. Increasing the charge mass at a constant EGR fraction resulted in significant reductions in PM, at the cost of slightly increased NOX By advancing the injection timing at high EGR fractions, PM emissions and fuel efficiency were improved, with only a slight increase in NOX emissions compared to the more retarded injection timings. The engine speed influenced the amount of EGR that could be recirculated, with lower speeds resulting in higher achievable EGR fractions. These results suggest that EGR fractions in excess of 20 per cent can achieve NOX reductions beyond 75 per cent, without causing unacceptable increases in PM emissions or significant reductions in fuel efficiency.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "1f015b17b22cc5d92642fe5ab0a8cd04f286929a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2324819140", "CorpusId": 126556565}, "title": "Individualized responsibility and climate change: 'if climate protection becomes everyone's responsibility, does it end up being no-one's?'", "abstract": "Whereas global compacts, such as the Kyoto Protocol have yet to consolidate action from governments on climate change, there has been increasing acknowledgement of the role of individuals (in their roles as citizens and consumers) as contributors to climate change and as responsible agents in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. \nRecently along with the acknowledgement of the threat that anthropogenic climate change presents to the planet, there has been increased emphasis by governments and non-government organizations on personal responsibility campaigns targeting individuals and households with a view to stemming the growth of greenhouse gas emissions.

The study inventories near-term bio-mass supply in the province, quantifies environmental metrics associated with the use of agricultural residues for producing electricity and ethanol, determines the incremental costs of switching from fossil fuels to biomass, and compares the cost-effectiveness of greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollutant emissions abatement achieved through the use of the bioenergy. Implementing a biomass cofiring rate of 10% in existing coal-fired power plants would reduce annual GHG emissions by 2.3 million metric tons (t) of CO2 equivalent (7% of the province\u2019s coal power plant emissions). The substitution of gasoline with ethanol/gasoline blends would reduce annual provincial light-duty vehicle fleet emissions between 1.3 and 2.5 million t of CO2 equivalent (3.5\u20137% of fleet emissions). If biomass sources other than agricultural residues were used, additional emissions reductions could be realized. At current crude oil prices ($70/barrel) and levels of technology development of the bioenergy alternatives, the biomass electricity cofiring scenario analyzed is more cost-effective for mitigating GHG emissions ($22/t of CO2 equivalent for a 10% cofiring rate) than the stand-alone ethanol production scenario ($92/t of CO2 equivalent). The economics of biomass cofiring benefits from existing capital, whereas the cellulosic ethanol scenario does not. Notwithstanding this result, there are several factors that increase the attractiveness of ethanol. These include uncertainty in crude oil prices, potential for marked improvements in cellulosic ethanol technology and economics, the province\u2019s commitment to 5% ethanol content in gasoline, the possibility of ethanol production benefiting from existing capital, and there being few alternatives for moderate-to-large-scale GHG emissions reductions in the transportation sector.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "466d688a6472d866a421ea1419d730a94ae09fcc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "585100061", "CorpusId": 106704126}, "title": "Status and Outlook for Biofuels, Other Alternative Fuels and New Vehicles", "abstract": "The report presents an outlook for alternative motor fuels and new vehicles.

Most of the growth in demand for energy in general, as well as for transport fuels, will take place in non-OECD countries. Gasoline and diesel are projected to remain the dominant automotive fuels until 2030. Vehicle technology and high quality fuels will eventually solve the problem of harmful exhaust emissions. However, the problem with CO2 still remains, and much attention will be given to increase efficiency. Hybrid technology is one option to reduce fuel consumption. Diesel engines are fuel efficient, but have high emissions compared with advanced gasoline engines. New combustion systems combining the best qualities of gasoline and diesel engines promise low emissions as well as high efficiency. The scenarios for alternative fuels vary a lot. By 2030, alternative fuels could represent a 10. 30% share of transport fuels, depending on policies. Ambitious goals for biofuels in transport have been set.

Limiting global warming to 2 \u00b0C is a challenging goal and will entail a dramatic transformation of the global energy system, largely complete by 2040. As part of the work toward this goal, countries have been submitting their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, indicating their emissions reduction commitments through 2025 or 2030, in advance of the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP21) in Paris in December 2015. In this paper, we use the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) to analyze the near versus long-term energy and economic-cost implications of these INDCs. The INDCs imply near-term actions that reduce the level of mitigation needed in the post-2030 period, particularly when compared with an alternative path in which nations are unable to undertake emissions mitigation until after 2030. We find that the latter case could require up to 2300 GW of premature retirements of fossil fuel power plants and up to 2900 GW of additional low-carbon power capacity installations within a five-year period of 2031\u20132035. INDCs have the effect of reducing premature retirements and new-capacity installations after 2030 by 50% and 34%, respectively.

We argue that a significant and understudied socio-environmental contradiction also occurs where the actual environmental outcomes of neighborhood transformation may not be what we expect. New research on greenhouse gas emissions shows that more affluent residents have much larger carbon footprints because of their consumption, even when reductions in transportation or building energy emissions are included. We describe an area in Seattle, Washington, the location of Amazon's headquarters, experiencing this contradiction and show a distinct convergence of city investments in low-carbon infrastructure, significant rises in housing prices and decreases in lower-income and non-white residents.

A severe reduction of greenhouse gas emissions is necessary to reach the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The implementation and continuous evaluation of mitigation measures requires regular independent information on emissions of the two main anthropogenic greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). Our aim is to employ an observation-based method to determine regional-scale greenhouse gas emission estimates with high accuracy. We use aircraft- and ground-based in situ observations of CH4, CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), and wind speed from two research flights over the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB), Poland, in summer 2018. The flights were performed as a part of the Carbon Dioxide and Methane (CoMet) mission above this European CH4 emission hot spot region. A kriging algorithm interpolates the observed concentrations between the downwind transects of the trace gas plume and then the mass flux through this plane is calculated. Finally, statistic and systematic uncertainties are calculated from measurement uncertainties and through several sensitivity tests, respectively. For the two selected flights, the in situ derived annual CH4 emission estimates are 13.8\u2009\u00b1\u20093.6\u2009kg/s and 15.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0\u2009kg/s, which is well within the range of emission inventories. The regional emission estimates of CO2, which were determined to be 1.21\u2009\u00b1\u20090.72\u2009t/s and 1.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.37\u2009t/s, are in the lower range of emission inventories. CO mass balance emissions of 10.1\u2009\u00b1\u20093.2\u2009kg/s and 10.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9\u2009kg/s for the USCB are slightly higher than the emission inventory values. The CH4 emission estimate has a relative error of 21\u201326\u2009%, the CO2 estimate of 33\u201360\u2009%, and the CO estimate of 27\u201332\u2009%. These errors mainly result from the uncertainty of atmospheric background mole fractions and the changing planetary boundary layer height during the morning flight. In the case of CO2, biospheric fluxes also add to the uncertainty and hamper the assessment of emission inventories. These emission estimates characterize the USCB and help to verify emission inventories and develop climate mitigation strategies.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "c01386f8bbc7cdaee6e0006061425d842061d493", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2130739705", "DOI": "10.3168/jds.2013-7398", "CorpusId": 7797077, "PubMed": "24731636"}, "title": "Effects of ethyl-3-nitrooxy propionate and 3-nitrooxypropanol on ruminal fermentation, microbial abundance, and methane emissions in sheep.", "abstract": "The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of feeding ethyl-3-nitrooxy propionate (E3NP) and 3-nitrooxypropanol (3 NP), 2 recently developed compounds with potential antimethanogenic activity, in vitro and in vivo in nonlactating sheep on ruminal methane production, fermentation pattern, the abundance of major microbial groups, and feed degradability. Three experiments were conducted, 1 in vitro and 2 in vivo. The in vitro batch culture trial (experiment 1) tested 2 doses of E3NP and 3 NP (40 and 80 \u03bcL/L), which showed a substantial reduction of methane production (up to 95%) without affecting concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA). The 2 in vivo trials were conducted over 16 d (experiment 2) and 30 d (experiment 3) to study their effects in sheep. In experiment 2, 6 adult nonpregnant sheep, with permanent rumen cannula and fed alfalfa hay and oats (60:40), were treated with E3NP at 2 doses (50 and 500 mg/animal per day). After 7, 14, and 15 d of treatment, methane emissions were recorded in respiration chambers and rumen fluid samples were collected for VFA analysis and quantification of bacterial, protozoal, and archaeal numbers by real-time PCR. Methane production decreased by 29% compared with the control with the higher dose of E3NP on d 14 to 15. A decrease in the acetate:propionate ratio was observed without detrimental effects on dry matter intake. In experiment 3, 9 adult nonpregnant sheep, with permanent rumen cannula and fed with alfalfa hay and oats (60:40), were treated with E3NP or 3 NP at one dose (100mg/animal per day) over 30 d.

DMS was produced in slurries over the initial 1\u201324 h incubation. After the initial period of production, DMS decreased to undetectable levels and methane thiol (MSH) was produced. Inhibition of methanogenesis caused a 20% decrease in the rate of DMS consumption, while inhibition of sulfate reduction caused a 80% decrease in DMS consumption. When sulfate reduction and methanogenesis were simultaneously inhibited, DMS did not decrease. DMS contributed about 28% to the methane production rate, while DMS probably contributed only 1% or less to the sulfate reduction rate. Incubation of the sediment slurries under an atmosphere of air resulted in similar DMS consumption compared to anaerobic incubations, but MSH and CH 4 were not evolved. Sediments from the marsh released significant quantities of DMS when treated with cold alkali, indicating that potentially significant sources of DMS existed in the sediments. Values of base-hydrolyzable DMS as high as 190 \u03bcmol per liter of sediment were observed near the sediment surface, and values always decreased with depth in the sediment. Simple flux experiments with small intact sediment cores, showed that DMS was emitted from the marsh surface when cores were injected with glutaraldehyde or molybdate and 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES), but nit when cores were left uninhibited. These results showed that DMS was readily metabolized by microbes in marsh sediments and that this metabolism may be responsible for reducing the emission of DMS from the marsh surface.", "year": 1988}, {"paperId": "b047e360c9a741c8760a2b94ab77d177df8ba18c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2158479858", "PubMedCentral": "3413612", "DOI": "10.1186/1471-2229-12-60", "CorpusId": 7581782, "PubMed": "22548747"}, "title": "RNAi-mediated silencing of the HD-Zip gene HD20 in Nicotiana attenuata affects benzyl acetone emission from corollas via ABA levels and the expression of metabolic genes", "abstract": "BackgroundThe N. attenuata HD20 gene belongs to the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) type I family of transcription factors and it has been previously associated with the regulation of ABA accumulation in leaves and the emission of benzyl acetone (BA; 4-phenyl-2-butanone) from night flowers. In this study, N. attenuata plants stably reduced in the expression of HD20 (ir-hd20) were generated to investigate the mechanisms controlling the emission of BA from night flowers.ResultsThe expression of HD20 in corollas of ir-hd20 plants was reduced by 85 to 90% compared to wild-type plants (WT) without affecting flower morphology and development. Total BA emitted from flowers of ir-hd20 plants was reduced on average by 60%. This reduction occurred mainly at the late phase of BA emission and it was correlated with 2-fold higher levels of ABA in the corollas of ir-hd20 plants. When a 2-fold decline in ABA corolla levels of these plants was induced by salt stress, BA emissions recovered to WT levels. Supplying ABA to WT flowers either through the cuticle or by pedicle feeding reduced the total BA emissions by 25 to 50%; this reduction occurred primarily at the late phase of emission (similar to the reduction observed in corollas of ir-hd20 plants). Gene expression profiling of corollas collected at 12\u2009pm (six hours before the start of BA emission) revealed that 274 genes changed expression levels significantly in ir-hd20 plants compared to WT. Among these genes, more than 35% were associated with metabolism and the most prominent group was associated with the metabolism of aromatic compounds and phenylpropanoid derivatives.ConclusionsThe results indicated that regulation of ABA levels in corollas is associated with the late phase of BA emission in N. attenuata plants and that HD20 affects this latter process by mediating changes in both ABA levels and metabolic gene expression.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "008cf3518f06b1b8c68589a92ef397242f6e4a35", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2331357035", "DOI": "10.1021/es503587p", "CorpusId": 5406195, "PubMed": "25365783"}, "title": "The public health benefits of reducing fine particulate matter through conversion to cleaner heating fuels in New York City.", "abstract": "In recent years, both New York State and City issued regulations to reduce emissions from burning heating oil.

In the current paper, carbon flows from blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace (BF\u2010BOF) steelmaking systems are analyzed using Material Flow Analysis (MFA). The computation method is built and used to calculate CO2 emissions in three steel works. The amount of carbon flow and CO2 emission per ton of product ( EFCO2 ) of each process in BF\u2010BOF steeling systems is obtained. The results show that the EFCO2 of each process varies significantly. As for the highest percentage of parts, the EFCO2 of the blast furnace iron making is greater than 700 kg on average; however, the EFCO2 of casting is only roughly 50\u2009kg. The EFCO2 of the same process is more influenced by the firm size, and the main production equipment scale plays a small role. In the end, the input of coal and coke is decreased by using charcoal instead, CO2 is removed from blast furnace gas along with carbon capture and storage, and traditional energy saving approaches/technologies for CO2 reduction for the iron and steel industry are introduced.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "d1f02f23b9492790869973de572db32dd57e1942", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2587416875", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.6b03218", "CorpusId": 206561057, "PubMed": "28166626"}, "title": "In-Use NOx Emissions from Diesel and Liquefied Natural Gas Refuse Trucks Equipped with SCR and TWC, Respectively.", "abstract": "The California Air Resources Board (ARB) and the City of Sacramento undertook this study to characterize the in-use emissions from model year (MY) 2010 or newer diesel, liquefied natural gas (LNG), and hydraulic hybrid diesel engines during real-world refuse truck operation.

Understanding\nthe effectiveness of air pollution control policies is\nimportant for future policy making. China has implemented strict air pollution\ncontrol policies since the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP). There is still a lack\nof overall evaluation of the effects of air pollution control policies on\nPM2.5 pollution improvement in China since the 11th FYP. In this\nstudy, we aimed to assess the effects of air pollution control policies from\n2005 to 2017 on PM2.5 using satellite remote sensing. We\nused the satellite-derived PM2.5 of 2005\u20132013 from one of our previous\nstudies. For the data of 2014\u20132017, we developed a two-stage statistical\nmodel to retrieve satellite PM2.5 data using the Moderate Resolution\nImaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 aerosol optical depth (AOD),\nassimilated meteorology, and land use data. The first stage is a\nday-specific linear mixed effects (LME) model and the second stage is a generalized\nadditive model (GAM). Results show that the Energy Conservation and\nEmissions Reduction (ECER) policy, implemented in the 11th FYP period and\nfocused on SO2 emissions control, had co-benefits with PM2.5\nreductions. The increasing trends of PM2.5 pollution (1.88 and\n3.14\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123\u2009year\u22121 for all of China and the Jingjinji region in 2004\u20132007, p<0.005) were suppressed after 2007.

The\nECER policy during the 12th FYP period was basically an extension of\nthe 11th FYP policy. PM2.5 is a kind of composite pollutant which\ncomprises primary particles and secondary particles such as sulfate,\nnitrate, ammonium, organic carbon, elemental carbon, etc. Since the ECER policy\nfocused on single-pollutant control, it had shown great limitation for\nPM2.5 reductions. The PM2.5 concentrations did not decrease from\n2010 to 2013 in polluted areas (p\u00a0values of the trends were greater than\n0.05). Therefore, China implemented two stricter policies: the 12th FYP on\nAir Pollution Prevention and Control in Key Regions (APPC-KR) in 2012, and\nthe Action Plan of Air Pollution Prevention and Control (APPC-AP) in 2013.

The trade-off between photosynthesis and transpiration through stomata, the water-use efficiency (WUE), is an important driver of plant evolution and ecosystem functioning, and has profound effects on climate. Using stable carbon and oxygen isotope ratios in tree rings, we found that WUE has increased by a magnitude consistent with estimates from atmospheric measurements and model predictions. Enhanced photosynthesis was widespread, while reductions in stomatal conductance were modest and restricted to moisture-limited forests. This result points to smaller reductions in transpiration in response to increasing atmospheric CO2, with important implications for forest\u2013climate interactions, which remain to be explored. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that plant water-use efficiency (WUE)\u2014the ratio of carbon assimilation to water loss\u2014has increased in recent decades. Although rising atmospheric CO2 has been proposed as the principal cause, the underlying physiological mechanisms are still being debated, and implications for the global water cycle remain uncertain. Here, we addressed this gap using 30-y tree ring records of carbon and oxygen isotope measurements and basal area increment from 12 species in 8 North American mature temperate forests. Our goal was to separate the contributions of enhanced photosynthesis and reduced stomatal conductance to WUE trends and to assess consistency between multiple commonly used methods for estimating WUE. Our results show that tree ring-derived estimates of increases in WUE are consistent with estimates from atmospheric measurements and predictions based on an optimal balancing of carbon gains and water costs, but are lower than those based on ecosystem-scale flux observations. Although both physiological mechanisms contributed to rising WUE, enhanced photosynthesis was widespread, while reductions in stomatal conductance were modest and restricted to species that experienced moisture limitations. This finding challenges the hypothesis that rising WUE in forests is primarily the result of widespread, CO2-induced reductions in stomatal conductance.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "0cf4330481025b26a836094178831d61fa26d11c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2958914192", "DOI": "10.1088/2516-1083/AB0FA8", "CorpusId": 199083987}, "title": "Photovoltaic technology and visions for the future", "abstract": "Due to rapidly reducing costs, photovoltaics has suddenly emerged as a previously underestimated new force in the race to control global warming.

Several studies estimate that including REDD+ could reduce the costs of achieving climate policy goals over both the near and longer terms.

At 2644 km2, the zone encompasses most of Greater London. It restricts the entry of the oldest and most polluting diesel vehicles, including heavy-goods vehicles (haulage trucks), buses and coaches, larger vans, and minibuses. It does not apply to cars or motorcycles. The LEZ scheme will introduce increasingly stringent Euro emissions standards over time. The creation of this zone presented a unique opportunity to estimate the effects of a stepwise reduction in vehicle emissions on air quality and health. Before undertaking such an investigation, robust baseline data were gathered on air quality and the oxidative activity and metal content of particulate matter (PM) from air pollution monitors located in Greater London. In addition, methods were developed for using databases of electronic primary-care records in order to evaluate the zone's health effects. Our study began in 2007, using information about the planned restrictions in an agreed-upon LEZ scenario and year-on-year changes in the vehicle fleet in models to predict air pollution concentrations in London for the years 2005, 2008, and 2010. Based on this detailed emissions and air pollution modeling, the areas in London were then identified that were expected to show the greatest changes in air pollution concentrations and population exposures after the implementation of the LEZ. Using these predictions, the best placement of a pollution monitoring network was determined and the feasibility of evaluating the health effects using electronic primary-care records was assessed. To measure baseline pollutant concentrations before the implementation of the LEZ, a comprehensive monitoring network was established close to major roadways and intersections. Output-difference plots from statistical modeling for 2010 indicated seven key areas likely to experience the greatest change in concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) (at least 3 microg/m3) and of PM with an aerodynamic diameter < or = 10 microm (PM10) (at least 0.75 microg/m3) as a result of the LEZ; these suggested that the clearest signals of change were most likely to be measured near roadsides. The seven key areas were also likely to be of importance in carrying out a study to assess the health outcomes of an air quality intervention like the LEZ. Of the seven key areas, two already had monitoring sites with a full complement of equipment, four had monitoring sites that required upgrades of existing equipment, and one required a completely new installation. With the upgrades and new installations in place, fully ratified (verified) pollutant data (for PM10, PM with an aerodynamic diameter < or = 2.5 microm [PM2.5], nitrogen oxides [NOx], and ozone [O3] at all sites as well as for particle number, black smoke [BS], carbon monoxide [CO], and sulfur dioxide [SO2] at selected sites) were then collected for analysis. In addition, the seven key monitoring sites were supported by other sites in the London Air Quality Network (LAQN). From these, a robust set of baseline air quality data was produced. Data from automatic and manual traffic counters as well as automatic license-plate recognition cameras were used to compile detailed vehicle profiles. This enabled us to establish more precise associations between ambient pollutant concentrations and vehicle emissions. An additional goal of the study was to collect baseline PM data in order to test the hypothesis that changes in traffic densities and vehicle mixes caused by the LEZ would affect the oxidative potential and metal content of ambient PM10 and PM2.5. The resulting baseline PM data set was the first to describe, in detail, the oxidative potential and metal content of the PM10 and PM2.5 of a major city's airshed. PM in London has considerable oxidative potential; clear differences in this measure were found from site to site, with evidence that the oxidative potential of both PM10 and PM2.5 at roadside monitoring sites was higher than at urban background locations. In the PM10 samples this increased oxidative activity appeared to be associated with increased concentrations of copper (Cu), barium (Ba), and bathophenanthroline disulfonate-mobilized iron (BPS Fe) in the roadside samples. In the PM2.5 samples, no simple association could be seen, suggesting that other unmeasured components were driving the increased oxidative potential in this fraction of the roadside samples. These data suggest that two components were contributing to the oxidative potential of roadside PM, namely Cu and BPS Fe in the coarse fraction of PM (PM with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 microm to 10 microm; PM(2.5-10)) and an unidentified redox catalyst in PM2.5. The data derived for this baseline study confirmed key observations from a more limited spatial mapping exercise published in our earlier HEI report on the introduction of the London's Congestion Charging Scheme (CCS) in 2003 (Kelly et al. 2011a,b). In addition, the data set in the current report provided robust baseline information on the oxidative potential and metal content of PM found in the London airshed in the period before implementation of the LEZ; the finding that a proportion of the oxidative potential appears in the PM coarse mode and is apparently related to brake wear raises important issues regarding the nature of traffic management schemes. The final goal of this baseline study was to establish the feasibility, in ethical and operational terms, of using the U.K.'s electronic primary-care records to evaluate the effects of the LEZ on human health outcomes. Data on consultations and prescriptions were compiled from a pilot group of general practices (13 distributed across London, with 100,000 patients; 29 situated in the inner London Borough of Lambeth, with 200,000 patients). Ethics approvals were obtained to link individual primary-care records to modeled NOx concentrations by means of post-codes. (To preserve anonymity, the postcodes were removed before delivery to the research team.) A wide range of NOx exposures was found across London as well as within and between the practices examined. Although we observed little association between NOx exposure and smoking status, a positive relationship was found between exposure and increased socioeconomic deprivation. The health outcomes we chose to study were asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, wheeze, hay fever, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. These outcomes were measured as prevalence or incidence. Their distributions by age, sex, socioeconomic deprivation, ethnicity, and smoking were found to accord with those reported in the epidemiology literature. No cross-sectional positive associations were found between exposure to NOx and any of the studied health outcomes; some associations were significantly negative. After the pilot study, a suitable primary-care database of London patients was identified, the General Practice Research Database responsible for giving us access to these data agreed to collaborate in the evaluation of the LEZ, and an acceptable method of ensuring privacy of the records was agreed upon. The database included about 350,000 patients who had remained at the same address over the four-year period of the study. Power calculations for a controlled longitudinal analysis were then performed, indicating that for outcomes such as consultations for respiratory illnesses or prescriptions for asthma there was sufficient power to identify a 5% to 10% reduction in consultations for patients most exposed to the intervention compared with patients presumed to not be exposed to it. In conclusion, the work undertaken in this study provides a good foundation for future LEZ evaluations. Our extensive monitoring network, measuring a comprehensive set of pollutants (and a range of particle metrics), will continue to provide a valuable tool both for assessing the impact of LEZ regulations on air quality in London and for furthering understanding of the link between PM's composition and toxicity. Finally, we believe that in combination with our modeling of the predicted population-based changes in pollution exposure in London, the use of primary-care databases forms a sound basis and has sufficient statistical power for the evaluation of the potential impact of the LEZ on human health.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "778051f2ac0d482138787e7a1befdfe631efd384", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2978964537", "DOI": "10.1115/GT2010-23621", "CorpusId": 110376256}, "title": "Assessment of Future Aero Engine Designs With Intercooled and Intercooled Recuperated Cores", "abstract": "Reduction of CO2 emissions is strongly linked with the improvement of engine specific fuel consumption, as well as the reduction of engine nacelle drag and weight. Conventional turbofan designs however that reduce CO2 emissions - such as increased OPR designs - can increase the production of NOx emissions. In the present work, funded by the European Framework 6 collaborative project NEWAC, an aero engine multidisciplinary design tool, TERA2020, has been utilised to study the potential benefits from introducing heat-exchanged cores in future turbofan \nengine designs. The tool comprises of various modules covering a wide range of disciplines: engine performance, engine aerodynamic and mechanical design, aircraft design and performance, emissions prediction and environmental impact, engine and airframe noise, as well as production, maintenance and direct operating costs. Fundamental performance differences between heat-exchanged cores and a conventional core are discussed and quantified. Cycle limitations imposed by mechanical considerations, operational limitations and emissions legislation are also discussed. The research work presented in this paper concludes with a full assessment at aircraft system level that reveals the significant potential performance benefits for the intercooled and intercooled recuperated cycles. An intercooled core can be designed for a significantly higher OPR and with reduced cooling air requirements, providing a higher thermal efficiency than could otherwise be practically achieved with a conventional core. Variable geometry can be implemented to optimise the use of the intercooler for a given flight mission. An intercooled recuperated core can provide high thermal efficiency at low OPR values and also benefit significantly from the introduction of a variable geometry low pressure turbine. The necessity of introducing novel lean-burn combustion technology, to reduce NOx emissions, at cruise as well as for the landing and take-off cycle, is demonstrated for both heat-exchanged cores and conventional designs.

Sc. Abstract Mineral carbonation is one of the options that can contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions for climate change mitigation purposes. Steel manufacturing, which is one of the biggest industrial sources of CO2 emissions, could benefit from this option by utilizing its own by-products, i.e., steelmaking slags, to combine with CO2. Additional benefits would be achieved if the end product was a pure and marketable calcium carbonate. The utilization of CaCO3 derived from steelmaking slag to replace some of the synthetic CaCO3 used in industry would simultaneously save virgin material resources, reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and provide a new utilization option for the low-value slag. The objective of the research reported in this thesis was to investigate the possibility of reducing CO2 emissions by utilizing steelmaking slags as raw material for CO2 mineralization. The target was that the end product of the CO2 mineralization would be a pure CaCO3 suitable for utilization. The suitability of the acetic acid process route suggested by Kakizawa et al. (2001) was tested first. Experiments showed that acetic acid dissolves calcium efficiently from steelmaking slags. A weak acetic acid solution was able to dissolve lime selectively from the steel converter slag, forming a clearly alkaline solution. Nonetheless, efficient CaCO3 precipitation required the addition of NaOH to prevent the regeneration of acid during carbonation, as well as to increase the alkalinity of the solution in those cases where a stronger acetic acid solution was used for the dissolution step. Preliminary process calculations revealed that chemical costs make the process clearly too expensive for CO2 sequestration. Because the production of pure CaCO3 from steelmaking slags with acetic acid was not feasible, various other solvents were tested. Three ammonium salt solutions (CH3COONH4, NH4NO3, and NH4Cl) dissolved calcium selectively from the steel converter slag and almost as efficiently as acids. The precipitated calcium carbonates were very pure. It was calculated that the production of pure calcium carbonate from steel converter slag by using ammonium salts as a solvent has clearly negative CO2 emissions. Since it was found that the method is not suitable for just any waste/by product materials that contain calcium, but should be applicable for at least those that contain free CaO, this method has potential only for minor-scale, yet significant, CO2 storage. A clear advantage is, however, that it uses a low value by-product as its raw material and has economic potential.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "8d00c245b754f04ec9d4549345738777c2ddb546", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2986466896", "DOI": "10.1108/aeat-05-2019-0095", "CorpusId": 209768655}, "title": "Effect of hydrogen addition on exergetic performance of gas turbine engine", "abstract": "\nPurpose\nThe depletion of fossil fuel and emissions of harmful gases forced the pioneers in search of alternate energy source. The purpose of this study is to present an effective use of hydrogen fuel for turbojet engines based on its exergetic performance.\n\n\nDesign/methodology/approach\nThis study was performed to measure the assessment of exergetic data of turbojet engines. Initially, the test was carried out on the Jet A-1 fuel. Then, a series of similar tests were carried out on turbojet engines with hydrogen fuel to measure their performance results. Finally, the exergetic values of both were compared with each other.\n\n\nFindings\nThe introduction of hydrogen fuel reduced the exergy efficiency, and a 10 per cent reduction was observed in exergy efficiency. Simultaneously, the waste exergy rate increased by 9 per cent. However, because of the high specific fuel exergy, hydrogen fuel was better than Jet A-1 fuel. Note that parameters such as environmental effect factor and ecological effect witnessed an increase in their index owing to the addition of hydrogen.\n\n\nPractical implications\nIntroduction of alternative blends is necessary for achieving lower emission of gases such as CO, NOx and CO2 from gas turbine engines without compromising on performance. The Jet A fuels were replaced by blends to obtain better emission characteristics.\n\n\nOriginality/value\nThe use of hydrogen in turbojet engines showed an adverse effect on exergetic performance. However, it was very impressive to see a 200 per cent reduction in emissions. From the comparison of exergy efficiency results of inlet, combustion and nozzle, it is evident that the combustion chamber has the largest values of exergy ratio, waste exergy ratio, cost flow, ecological factor, environmental factor and fuel ratio owing to irreversibility in the combustion process.\n", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "bd38fdae688aa4d753c3b7097df4bf6729bee779", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2117805427", "DOI": "10.1136/jnnp.2003.019547", "CorpusId": 26112460, "PubMed": "15258221"}, "title": "Subacute dementia and imaging correlates in a case of Fahr\u2019s disease", "abstract": "We report a case of idiopathic bilateral basal ganglia calcinosis, or Fahr\u2019s disease (FD) in a 50 year old patient who developed rapidly progressive behavioural abnormalities and severe neuropsychological impairments, but no movement disorder.

However, most selective emitters are fixed to specific wavelength ranges and lack dynamic control mechanisms.

However, most of this concrete is used as highway base or sent to landfills for disposal; only a very small portion of the concrete waste is reused in building construction. Considering the fact that usable natural aggregate (NA) supplies are diminishing, there will be a high demand for recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) to be used in the so called ldquogreen concrete (GC)rdquo. Using recycled concrete as aggregate will help reduce the total cost of concrete production because aggregates need not be hauled from remote locations, but obtained locally. The combination of RCA with significant quantities of fly ash or slag as replacement for Portland cement is particularly attractive from both economic and environmental perspectives. GC will reduce the demand for natural resources, the associated energy consumption, and green house gas (GHG) emissions required to produce aggregates and cement.

Several proposals were designed for such a mechanism, yet their implementation poses significant methodological problems: first, sophisticated tools available to measure the reduction of emissions might be ineffective when combined with baselines on a national level; secondly, baselines calculated ex ante lack accuracy because of insufficient knowledge concerning the direct and underlying causes of deforestation; thirdly, baselines calculated ex post lack legitimacy because they only refer to past trends; and fourthly, it is challenging to relate a reduction in deforestation rates to public policy options in the host country.Drawing lessons from our analysis of the methodological problems for the implementation of the mechanism, we recommend not promoting any mechanism based on financial rewards for an assumed voluntary reduction of national tropical deforestation rates. Two reasons justify our perspective: not only would the mechanism probably generate fake reductions (\u201chot air\u201d), but undesirable side effects\u2014detailed in this paper\u2014would also appear. Instead, we encourage industrialized countries to better use already existing multi- and bilateral instruments, which focus on the correction of governance deficiencies in countries home to tropical forests. It is also necessary to focus on the suppression of \u201cperverse incentives\u201d from public policies in tropical countries.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "23154cfc7f6e7ae007d2d4526bce116fc0ce7937", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2797222373", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-18-9861-2018", "CorpusId": 216910081}, "title": "Impacts of compound extreme weather events on ozone in the present and future", "abstract": "Abstract. The Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry\n(WRF-Chem) was used to study the effect of extreme weather events on\nozone in the US for historical (2001\u20132010) and future (2046\u20132055) periods\nunder the RCP8.5 scenario. During extreme weather events, including heat\nwaves, atmospheric stagnation, and their compound events, ozone concentration\nis much higher compared to the non-extreme events period. A striking enhancement\nof effect during compound events is revealed when heat wave and stagnation\noccur simultaneously as both high temperature and low wind speed promote the\nproduction of high ozone concentrations. In regions with high emissions,\ncompound extreme events can shift the high-end tails of the probability\ndensity functions (PDFs) of ozone to even higher values to generate extreme\nozone episodes. In regions with low emissions, extreme events can still\nincrease high-ozone frequency but the high-end tails of the PDFs are\nconstrained by the low emissions. Despite the large anthropogenic emission\nreduction projected for the future, compound events increase ozone more than\nthe single events by 10 to 13\u2009%, comparable to the present, and high-ozone episodes with a maximum daily 8\u2009h average (MDA8) ozone concentration over\n70\u2009ppbv are not eliminated. Using the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble, the\nfrequency of compound events is found to increase more dominantly compared to\nthe increased frequency of single events in the future over the US, Europe,\nand China. High-ozone episodes will likely continue in the future due to\nincreases in both frequency and intensity of extreme events, despite\nreductions in anthropogenic emissions of its precursors. However, the latter\ncould reduce or eliminate extreme ozone episodes; thus improving projections of\ncompound events and their impacts on extreme ozone may better constrain\nfuture projections of extreme ozone episodes that have detrimental effects on\nhuman health.\n", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "ab39ca30051c0c1fe9abc6b8bb82387ff1283752", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2048633529", "ArXiv": "patt-sol/9502007", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevLett.75.1859", "CorpusId": 2960159, "PubMed": "10060409"}, "title": "Aggregation Patterns in Stressed Bacteria.", "abstract": "We study the formation of spot patterns seen in bacterial colonies when the bacteria are subjected to oxidative stress due to hazardous by-products of respiration.

Vital to its success is achieving a decrease in the abundance of atmospheric methane (CH4), the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. If this reduction is to be achieved, individual nations must make and meet reduction goals in their nationally determined contributions, with regular and independently verifiable global stock taking. Targets for the Paris Agreement have been set, and now the capability must follow to determine whether CH4 reductions are actually occurring. At present, however, there are significant limitations in the ability of scientists to quantify CH4 emissions accurately at global and national scales and to diagnose what mechanisms have altered trends in atmospheric mole fractions in the past decades. For example, in 2007, mole fractions suddenly started rising globally after a decade of almost no growth. More than a decade later, scientists are still debating the mechanisms behind this increase. This study reviews the main approaches and limitations in our current capability to diagnose the drivers of changes in atmospheric CH4 and, crucially, proposes ways to improve this capability in the coming decade. Recommendations include the following: (i) improvements to process\u2010based models of the main sectors of CH4 emissions\u2014proposed developments call for the expansion of tropical wetland flux measurements, bridging remote sensing products for improved measurement of wetland area and dynamics, expanding measurements of fossil fuel emissions at the facility and regional levels, expanding country\u2010specific data on the composition of waste sent to landfill and the types of wastewater treatment systems implemented, characterizing and representing temporal profiles of crop growing seasons, implementing parameters related to ruminant emissions such as animal feed, and improving the detection of small fires associated with agriculture and deforestation; (ii) improvements to measurements of CH4 mole fraction and its isotopic variations\u2014developments include greater vertical profiling at background sites, expanding networks of dense urban measurements with a greater focus on relatively poor countries, improving the precision of isotopic ratio measurements of 13CH4, CH3D, 14CH4, and clumped isotopes, creating isotopic reference materials for international\u2010scale development, and expanding spatial and temporal characterization of isotopic source signatures; and (iii) improvements to inverse modeling systems to derive emissions from atmospheric measurements\u2014advances are proposed in the areas of hydroxyl radical quantification, in systematic uncertainty quantification through validation of chemical transport models, in the use of source tracers for estimating sector\u2010level emissions, and in the development of time and space resolved national inventories.

From an ecological perspective however, these increases are only expected to confer competitive advantages if they do not imply a significant cost for the plant, that is, growth reduction. We investigated shifts of isoprene emissions, and to a lesser extent phenolic compound concentration, of Quercus pubescens Willd. from early leaf development to leaf senescence under optimal watering (control: C), mild and severe water stress (MS, SS). The impact of water stress was concomitantly assessed on plant physiological (chlorophyll fluorescence, stomatal conductance, net photosynthesis, water potential) functional (relative leaf water content, leaf mass per area ratio) and growth (aerial and root biomass) traits. Growth changes allowed to estimate the eventual costs related to the production of isoprene and phenolics. The total phenolic content was not modified under water stress whereas isoprene emissions were promoted under MS over the entire growing cycle despite the decline of Pn by 35%. Under SS, isoprene emissions remained similar to C all over the study despite the decline of Pn by 47% and were thereby clearly uncoupled to Pn leading to an overestimation of the isoprene emission factor by 44%. Under SS, maintenance of isoprene emissions and phenolic compound concentration resulted in very significant costs for the plants as growth rates were very significantly reduced. Under MS, increases of isoprene emission and maintenance of phenolic compound concentration resulted in moderate growth reduction. Hence, it is likely that investment in isoprene emissions confers Q. pubescens an important competitive advantage during moderate but not severe periods of water scarcity. Consequences of this response for air quality in North Mediterranean areas are also discussed.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "cb7626cd3b7486b8f1d00df6525779cacdb36331", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1998257121", "DOI": "10.1080/01430750.2015.1004106", "CorpusId": 108453850}, "title": "Analysis of pre-heated crude palm oil, palm oil methyl ester and its blends as fuel in a diesel engine", "abstract": "Diesel engines are widely used in the surface transport system. They are the main source of economic growth of a nation. Nowadays, awareness of the environment compels people to adopt stringent emission norms. The rapid depletion of fossil fuels and the increase in the emission levels have caused concerns globally. An eco-friendly alternate is required to fulfil the growing demand. This paper focuses on alternate fuels and the importance of choosing palm oil. The energy density and higher cetane number are its major advantages. Also it reduces environmental pollution drastically. The viscosity of palm oil is a problem like other vegetable oils, which affects the fuel spray pattern. It reduces the efficiency of the combustion to a large extent. To overcome the problem, the pre-heating technique and transesterification process are adopted in this work. Performance tests were conducted on a single cylinder, four-stroke, direct injection diesel engine coupled with eddy current dynamometer, and emission was monitored using an AVL exhaust gas analyser. The results indicated that vegetable oil fuels have lower brake thermal efficiency compared to that of diesel. Pre-heated oil and methyl ester showed an appreciable reduction in hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions and higher exhaust temperature and nitric oxide (NOx) emission.", "year": 2016}]}
