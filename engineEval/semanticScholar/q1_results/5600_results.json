This reduction target is based on emissions in the reference year (1990) and must be reached by 2012. EU energy policy does not set any national targets, only an overall reduction target of 20% by 2020. This paper transfers global greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in both these documents to the transport sector and specifically to CO2 emissions. It proposes a nonlinear distribution method with objective, dynamic targets for reducing CO2 emissions in the transport sector, according to the context and characteristics of each geographical area. First, we analyse CO2 emissions from transport in the reference year (1990) and their evolution from 1990 to 2007. We then propose a nonlinear methodology for distributing dynamic CO2 emission reduction targets. We have applied the proposed distribution function for 2012 and 2020 at two territorial levels (EU member states and Spanish autonomous regions). The weighted distribution is based on per capita CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions per gross domestic product. Finally, we show the weighted targets found for each EU member state and each Spanish autonomous region, compare them with the real achievements to date, and forecast the situation for the years the Kyoto and EU goals are to be met. The results underline the need for \u2018weighted\u2019 decentralised decisions to be made at different territorial levels with a view to achieving a common goal, so relative convergence of all the geographical areas is reached over time.

The largest estimated influences on Canada (up to $250,000/day) were from emissions originating in the Quebec City\u2013Windsor Corridor, where population centers are concentrated.

Only lakes located near smelters that have dramatically reduced emissions approach this expectation. Lakes in the Atlantic provinces, Quebec and Ontario affected only by long-range sources show a general decline in sulfate (SO42\u2212) concentrations, but with a relatively smaller compensating increase in pH or alkalinity. Several factors may contribute to the constrained (or most likely delayed) acidity response: declining base cation concentrations, drought-induced mobilization of SO42\u2212, damaged internal alkalinity generation mechanisms, and perhaps increasing nitrate or organic anion levels. Monitoring to detect biological recovery in southeastern Canada is extremely limited, but where it occurs, there is little evidence of recovery outside of the Sudbury/Killarney area.

The deleterious health impacts of PM motivated the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to curtail emission of PM and precursor gases. The 2011 EPA report to Congress on the efficacy of the Clean Air Act estimated a dramatic reduction in human mortality resulting from these emissions controls. Surface measurements from 1990 to 2012 indicate a significant US-wide decline in the organic portion of the PM, not accounted for in the EPA report. We show that the decline in organic aerosol is mediated primarily through changes in vehicle and residential fuel-burning emissions, indicating that the Clean Air Act is even more beneficial to US air quality than currently appreciated. Exposure to atmospheric particulate matter (PM) exacerbates respiratory and cardiovascular conditions and is a leading source of premature mortality globally. Organic aerosol contributes a significant fraction of PM in the United States. Here, using surface observations between 1990 and 2012, we show that organic carbon has declined dramatically across the entire United States by 25\u201350%; accounting for more than 30% of the US-wide decline in PM. The decline is in contrast with the increasing organic aerosol due to wildfires and no clear trend in biogenic emissions. By developing a carbonaceous emissions database for the United States, we show that at least two-thirds of the decline in organic aerosol can be explained by changes in anthropogenic emissions, primarily from vehicle emissions and residential fuel burning. We estimate that the decrease in anthropogenic organic aerosol is responsible for averting 180,000 (117,000\u2013389,000) premature deaths between 1990 and 2012. The unexpected decrease in organic aerosol, likely a consequence of the implementation of Clean Air Act Amendments, results in 84,000 (30,000\u2013164,000) more lives saved than anticipated by the EPA between 2000 and 2010.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "348f606f6646222da6a71992f137a301048e83d4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2081012505", "DOI": "10.1021/ES0479742", "CorpusId": 24049287, "PubMed": "16433369"}, "title": "Unregulated emissions from compressed natural gas (CNG) transit buses configured with and without oxidation catalyst.", "abstract": "The unregulated emissions from two in-use heavy-duty transit buses fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG) and equipped with oxidation catalyst (OxiCat) control were evaluated. We tested emissions from a transit bus powered by a 2001 Cummins Westport C Gas Plus 8.3-L engine (CWest), which meets the California Air Resources Board's (CARB) 2002 optional NOx standard (2.0 g/bhp-hr). In California, this engine is certified only with an OxiCat, so our study did not include emissions testing without it. We also tested a 2000 New Flyer 40-passenger low-floor bus powered by a Detroit Diesel series 50G engine (DDCs50G) that is currently certified in California without an OxiCat. The original equipment manufacturer (OEM) offers a \"low-emission\" package for this bus that includes an OxiCat for transit bus applications, thus, this configuration was also tested in this study. Previously, we reported that formaldehyde and other volatile organic emissions detected in the exhaust of the DDCs50G bus equipped with an OxiCat were significantly reduced relative to the same DDCs50G bus without OxiCat. In this paper, we examine othertoxic unregulated emissions of significance. The specific mutagenic activity of emission sample extracts was examined using the microsuspension assay. The total mutagenic activity of emissions (activity per mile) from the OxiCat-equipped DDC bus was generally lower than that from the DDC bus without the OxiCat. The CWest bus emission samples had mutagenic activity that was comparable to that of the OxiCat-equipped DDC bus. In general, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emissions were lower forthe OxiCat-equipped buses, with greater reductions observed for the volatile and semivolatile PAH emissions. Elemental carbon (EC) was detected in the exhaust from the all three bus configurations, and we found that the total carbon (TC) composition of particulate matter (PM) emissions was primarily organic carbon (OC). The amount of carbon emissions far exceeded the PM-associated inorganic element emissions, which were detected in all exhaust samples, at comparatively small emission rates. In summary, based on these results and those referenced from our group, the use of OxiCat for the new CWest engine and as a retrofit option for the DDCs50G engine generally results in the reduction of tailpipe toxic emissions.

In addition, it is now well known that ITS technology can be used to reduce transportation-related environmental impacts.

Atmospheric chemical fields are simulated by WRF/CMAQ (horizontal resolution: 12 \u00d7 12km), applying the dynamical downscaling technique from global climate-chemistry model under the Representative Concentration Pathways scenario (RCP 8.5). Future air quality results predict that the annual mean PM2.5 concentration in continental U.S. decreases nationwide, especially in the Eastern U.S. and west coast. However, the ozone concentration is projected to decrease in the Eastern U.S. but increase in the Western U.S. Future mortality is evaluated under two scenarios (1) holding future population and baseline incidence rate at the present level and (2) using the projected baseline incidence rate and population in 2050. For PM2.5, the entire continental U.S. presents a decreasing trend of PM2.5-related mortality by the 2050s in Scenario (1), primarily resulting from the emissions reduction. While in Scenario (2), almost half of the continental states show a rising tendency of PM2.5-related mortality, due to the dominant influence of population growth. In particular, the highest PM2.5-related deaths and the biggest discrepancy between present and future PM2.5-related deaths both occur in California in 2050s. For the ozone-related premature mortality, the simulation shows nation-wide rising tendency in 2050s under both scenarios, mainly due to the increase of ozone concentration and population in the future. Furthermore, the uncertainty analysis shows that the confidence interval of all causes mortality is much larger than that for specific causes, probably due to the accumulated uncertainty of generating datasets and sample size. The confidence interval of ozone-related all cause premature mortality is narrower than the PM2.5-related all cause mortality, due to its smaller standard deviation of the concentration-mortality response factor. Implications:\u2003The health impact of PM2.5 is more linearly proportional to the emission reductions than ozone. The reduction of anthropogenic PM2.5 precursor emissions is likely to lead to the decrease of PM2.5 concentrations and PM2.5 related mortality. However, the future ozone concentrations could increase due to increase of the greenhouse gas emissions of methane. Thus, to reduce the impact of ozone related mortality, anthropogenic emissions including criteria pollutant and greenhouse gas (i.e. methane) need to be controlled.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "79f25e74bb810a28c8490c8cc692198dc64eae1d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2598964026", "DOI": "10.1080/09593330.2017.1313317", "CorpusId": 3584845, "PubMed": "28355494"}, "title": "Potential methane emission reductions for two manure treatment technologies", "abstract": "ABSTRACT The effect of two dairy manure treatments, solid\u2013liquid separation (SLS) and anaerobic digestion (AD), on methane potential and the speed of production was evaluated. Assays were performed in the lab to measure methane (CH4) production over 202\u2005d from dairy manure samples taken before and after each treatment. Compared to raw manure, CH4 emissions on a per-L basis were reduced 81% by SLS and 59% by AD, on average. The mean (SD) ultimate CH4 emission potential (B0) per kg of volatile solids (VS) was 247 (8) L\u2005CH4\u2005kg\u22121\u2005VS for raw manure, 221 (9) L\u2005CH4\u2005kg\u22121\u2005VS for separated liquid, and 160 (4) L\u2005CH4\u2005kg\u22121\u2005VS for anaerobic digestate. Thus, SLS reduced the B0 of the liquid fraction by 11% and AD reduced B0 by up to 35% compared to raw manure. Manure treatment affected the speed of CH4 production: SLS increased the CH4 production rate and thus separated liquid manure was the fastest to produce 90% of the ultimate CH4 production. Therefore, both the speed of degradation and B0 should be considered when assessing these techniques for farm-scale manure storages, because actual emission reductions will depend on storage conditions.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "c4cdfd8d44c2063d62ff32cfdadc0d81439534d1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1991394844", "DOI": "10.1007/s40831-015-0008-6", "CorpusId": 128407934}, "title": "Development of Low-Emission Integrated Steelmaking Process", "abstract": "This paper provides a summary of the progress made over the 8\u00a0years of an R&D program that focused on the development of know-how and processes that could result in substantial reduction in net CO2 emission by the steel industry. The processes that were developed covered introduction of renewable carbon and energy sources as well as minimising waste heat from processes. The current status of each of the processes and application areas is provided. The use of biomass-derived fuels and reductants in the ironmaking and steelmaking industry provides a sustainable option for reducing net CO2 emissions at a lower capital cost and technological risk than other breakthrough technologies under development. A key focus of this program has been to partially substitute these fossil-based fuels with renewable carbon (charcoal) from sustainable sources such as plantations of biomass species or forest wastes. Raw biomass is unsuitable for applications in ironmaking and steelmaking and should be converted into charcoal (char) through a pyrolysis process before use. A new pyrolysis process which operates continuously and autogenously has been developed and piloted. The biomass-derived chars and hydrocarbon fuels have great potential in lowering the net CO2 emissions of integrated (BF-BOF route) steel plants. Life cycle assessment has quantified the potential reduction in net CO2 emissions and covers cradle to gate, including plantation, harvesting, transport, pyrolysis and use of chars and bio-oil products. The properties of chars produced by biomass pyrolysis can be tailored to each of the several applications proposed (sintering solid fuel, cokemaking blend component, blast furnace tuyere injectant, liquid steel recarburiser, etc.), thus resulting in optimal performance and greater value-in-use of the char. Our economic analysis has made allowance for such value-in-use in applications, particularly as a replacement for BF pulverised coal injection. This analysis shows that key factors influencing the economics are the net cost of producing charcoal from biomass, selection of pyrolysis technology, value of the pyrolysis by-products, as well as the value-in-use for the charcoal. Dry slag granulation (DSG) has the potential to make a fundamental change in slag treatment and deliver a more sustainable alternative compared with the conventional water granulation process. The DSG process not only saves valuable water resources and reduces sulphurous emissions, but it may also recover a large amount of the high-grade heat in molten slag so to reduce greenhouse gas emission.

We performed spectroscopic observations with echelle spectrographs to cover the entirety of the optical spectral range simultaneously. Standard data reduction was performed with the IRAF EC HELL E package. We applied the spectral subtraction technique to reveal chromospheric emission in the stars of the sample. The equivalent width of chromospheric emission lines was measured in the subtracted spectra and then converted to fluxes using equivalent width-flux relationships. Radial and rotational velocities were determined by the cross-correlation technique. Kinematics, equivalent widths of the lithium line \u03bb6707.8 A and spectral types were also determined. Results. A catalog of spectroscopic data is compiled: radial and rotational velocities, space motion, equivalent widths of optical chromospheric activity indicators from Ca II H & K to the calcium infrared triplet and the lithium line in \u03bb6708 A.

A variety of diagnostic methods are used to determine how heat waves, heavy precipitation, drought, wind storms, and storm surges change between present (1961\u201390) and future (2071\u20132100) climate on the basis of regional climate model simulations produced by the PRUDENCE project. A summary of the main results follows. Heat waves \u2013 Regional surface warming causes the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves to increase over Europe. By the end of the twenty first century, countries in central Europe will experience the same number of hot days as are currently experienced in southern Europe. The intensity of extreme temperatures increases more rapidly than the intensity of more moderate temperatures over the continental interior due to increases in temperature variability. Precipitation \u2013 Heavy winter precipitation increases in central and northern Europe and decreases in the south; heavy summer precipitation increases in north-eastern Europe and decreases in the south. Mediterranean droughts start earlier in the year and last longer. Winter storms \u2013 Extreme wind speeds increase between 45\u00b0N and 55\u00b0N, except over and south of the Alps, and become more north-westerly than cuurently. These changes are associated with reductions in mean sea-level pressure, leading to more North Sea storms and a corresponding increase in storm surges along coastal regions of Holland, Germany and Denmark, in particular. These results are found to depend to different degrees on model formulation. While the responses of heat waves are robust to model formulation, the magnitudes of changes in precipitation and wind speed are sensitive to the choice of regional model, and the detailed patterns of these changes are sensitive to the choice of the driving global model. In the case of precipitation, variation between models can exceed both internal variability and variability between different emissions scenarios.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "f3ae9eb0cea670af073d757a8851ea11ffa5d379", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2097272425", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1510856112", "CorpusId": 20376109, "PubMed": "26460052"}, "title": "Global alteration of ocean ecosystem functioning due to increasing human CO2 emissions", "abstract": "Significance People are not only concerned about climate change and its effects on plant and animal diversity but also about how humans are fundamentally changing the globe\u2019s largest ecosystem that sustains economic revenue and food for many countries. We show that many species communities and ocean habitats will change from their current states. Ocean acidification and warming increase the potential for an overall simplification of ecosystem structure and function with reduced energy flow among trophic levels and little scope for species to acclimate. The future simplification of our oceans has profound consequences for our current way of life, particularly for coastal populations and those that rely on oceans for food and trade. Rising anthropogenic CO2 emissions are anticipated to drive change to ocean ecosystems, but a conceptualization of biological change derived from quantitative analyses is lacking. Derived from multiple ecosystems and latitudes, our metaanalysis of 632 published experiments quantified the direction and magnitude of ecological change resulting from ocean acidification and warming to conceptualize broadly based change. Primary production by temperate noncalcifying plankton increases with elevated temperature and CO2, whereas tropical plankton decreases productivity because of acidification. Temperature increases consumption by and metabolic rates of herbivores, but this response does not translate into greater secondary production, which instead decreases with acidification in calcifying and noncalcifying species. This effect creates a mismatch with carnivores whose metabolic and foraging costs increase with temperature. Species diversity and abundances of tropical as well as temperate species decline with acidification, with shifts favoring novel community compositions dominated by noncalcifiers and microorganisms. Both warming and acidification instigate reduced calcification in tropical and temperate reef-building species. Acidification leads to a decline in dimethylsulfide production by ocean plankton, which as a climate gas, contributes to cloud formation and maintenance of the Earth\u2019s heat budget. Analysis of responses in short- and long-term experiments and of studies at natural CO2 vents reveals little evidence of acclimation to acidification or temperature changes, except for microbes. This conceptualization of change across whole communities and their trophic linkages forecast a reduction in diversity and abundances of various key species that underpin current functioning of marine ecosystems.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "18219a6480b354ebfff8a258b2b9250506522cd3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "349085629", "CorpusId": 55986899}, "title": "Win-Win Emission Reduction Strategies", "abstract": "Transportation problems can be solved through win-win transportation solutions, which are market reforms that are cost-effective and technically feasible.

The percentage reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions to which the United States committed itself by signing the 1997 Protocol to the 1992 UN Frame work Convention on Climate Change was probably unachievable when the protocol was adopted. The protocol then languished in Washington for the final three years of the Clinton administration, which chose not to present it to the Senate for ratification. In accordance with a Senate resolution calling for the fitl par ticipation of the main developing countries in the protocol's emissions-cutting require ments, that pause was supposed to allow time for negotiation to bring those coun tries on board. But nobody thought any such negotiation could produce results, and no negotiation was ever attempted. George W. Bush, succeeding to the presidency three years after the protocol's signing, had some choices and may not have made the best choice when he rejected the plan outright last year. But the one option he did not have was to submit the protocol to the Senate for ratification. The U.S. \"commitment\" to the protocol meant cutting emissions significantly below their 1990 level by 2olo-which required a 25 or 30 percent reduction in projected emissions levels. Such a cut was almost certainly infeasible when the Clinton administration signed the protocol in 1997. Three years later, with no action toward reducing emissions, no evidence of any planning on how to reduce emis sions, and no attempt to inform the public or Congress about what might be required to meet that commitment, what might barely have been possible to achieve over 15 years-1997 to 2012-had become unreasonable. The Senate will not confirm a treaty unless it knows what actions the \"commitment\" entails, and no president could answer that question without a year's preparation.

However, these bio-oils are completely different from petroleum fuels and other bio-oils in the market, like biodiesels, as regards both their physical properties and chemical composition. When the unusual properties of these bio-oils are carefully taken into account, their combustion without a pilot flame or support fuel is possible on an industrial scale. Even blending of these oils with alcohols in order to improve combustion is not necessarily required. In the recent industrial scale bio-oil combustion tests, bio-oil has been found to be technically suitable for replacing heavy fuel oil in district heating applications. This kind of replacement, however, needs some modifications to be made to the existing units, which need to be engineered carefully. For example, all the parts in contact with bio-oil should be replaced with parts made of stainless steel or better, and the suitability of all gaskets and instruments needs to be checked. In general, the emissions in the bio-oil combustion are very dependent on the original levels of solids, water and nitrogen in the oil being combusted. Typically, the emissions levels are between those of light fuel oil and the lightest heavy fuel oil, but particulate emission may be higher. On the other hand, there are practically no SOx-emissions generated in the bio-oil combustion. The NOx-emission in bio-oil combustion mainly originates from fuel-bound nitrogen. Staged combustion for NOx-reduction may be recommended, as successful air staging in natural gas, heavy and light fuel oil combustion has already been done. The recent bio-oil combustion tests have also shown that bio-oil combustion technology works well, and there are not many possibilities of further lowering particulate emissions, since the majority of the particulates are typically incombustible matter. Therefore, it is recommended to reduce the solids content of the biooil to < 0.1 wt% if possible, and to ensure that inorganics in the form of ash and sand are present at as low a concentration as possible. Current burner designs are quite sensitive to the changes in the quality of the bio-oil, which may cause problems in ignition, flame detection and flame stabilization. Therefore, in order to be able to create reliable bio-oil combustion systems that operate at high efficiency, bio-oil grades should be standardized for combustion applications.

This model includes a modified reduction sequence where the major zones (from ground surface downward) were a near-surface zone of optimum CH 4 oxidation; a zone of optimum CO 2 production (predominantly from root zone respiration); a zone of optimum N 2 O production; and a deep zone dominated by transport of landfill gas (CH 4 and CO 2 ) from methanogenic production zones in the underlying refuse.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "90f3fc358a5f09bd7726c0d041dbb68f711009e8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2004662546", "DOI": "10.1029/2004JD005168", "CorpusId": 129303816}, "title": "Field monoterpene emission of Mediterranean oak (Quercus ilex) in the central Iberian Peninsula measured by enclosure and micrometeorological techniques: Observation of drought stress effect", "abstract": "[1]\u00a0An experimental characterization of biogenic emission from Quercus ilex ssp. rotundifolia in a forest near Madrid, Spain, was carried out in the early autumn of the years 2000\u20132003. A dynamic branch enclosure technique was implemented to determine the monoterpene emission rates of this evergreen oak species during the 2000 and 2001 campaigns. Major compounds emitted during both measurement periods were limonene, \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, sabinene, and myrcene. In the 2000 field campaign the light- and temperature-dependent model of Guenther et al. [1993] did not fit the data due to drastic reductions of emission rates (and leaf gas exchange related parameters) observed at high air temperature and low air humidity (high water vapor pressure deficit). This plant physiological activity depletion and the subsequent emission reduction were attributed to severe water soil deficit conditions, as precipitation was very scarce during the growing season. In contrast, during the 2001 field campaign, neither emission nor physiological activity showed strong decreases in hot days. A good fit of experimental data to Guenther model was achieved in this field campaign (r2 = 0.90), and linear regression gave a standard emission factor (ES) of 14.0 \u03bcg gdw\u22121 h\u22121 (gdw is grams dry weight). Soil moisture was presumably higher than during the 2000 campaign due to recent rain events. With the purpose of documenting the drought stress effect at canopy level, monoterpene oak fluxes were measured by the modified Bowen ratio micrometeorological technique throughout the 2001 field campaign and in the late summer of 2002 and 2003. The measured emission by both techniques showed a reasonably good correlation, although micrometeorological fluxes were, in general, lower than upscaled branch emission rates. According to Guenther's parameterization, standard emission fluxes (FS) of 0.30 \u03bcg m\u22122 s\u22121 (r2 = 0.61) and 0.28 \u03bcg m\u22122 s\u22121 (r2 = 0.67) were derived for the 2001 and 2002 field campaigns, respectively. However, measured fluxes in September 2003 at high ambient temperature were much lower than those of the previous years. Moreover, from the CLCT range in which emission in this field campaign could be fitted to a linear behavior, the FS value obtained was 50% lower than the 2001 and 2002 values.

Biofuels are being promoted to increase energy security and reduce GHG emissions through policies that establish mandates for blending biofuels with liquid fossil fuels and by setting standards for the reduction in the GHG intensity of transportation fuel. The Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) established by the Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007, sets quantity mandates for blending specific types of biofuels (based on their life-cycle GHG intensity) with fossil fuels. Although not initiated as a low-carbon fuel policy, it does seek to promote low carbon advanced biofuels and mitigate GHG emissions. It requires blending at least 136 billion (B) liters of biofuels (ethanol energy equivalence) with liquid fossil fuels by 2022; this would represent a five-fold increase in US biofuel consumption compared to that in 2007. A low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) requiring a 10% reduction in GHG intensity of transportation fuels by 2020 is being implemented in California (California Air Resources Board [CARB], 2009), and is being considered by several other states and at the national level. In contrast to these policies that indirectly seek to reduce GHG emissions, a carbon price policy could be established to create direct incentives to substitute low carbon fuels for fossil fuels. Biofuels can affect GHG emissions in three ways. First, they can displace an energy-equivalent amount of fossil fuels; second, they can affect fossil fuel consumption by affecting fuel price; and third, they can have an indirect effect on land use, which results in a release of carbon stored in soils and vegetation. The first (displacement) effect directly reduces GHG emissions by substituting energy-equivalent amount of biofuels for fossil fuels. The second (rebound or market-mediated) effect arises because any unilateral low-carbon policy that reduces demand for fossil fuels by a large country such as the United States will lead to a reduction in the demand for oil in the world oil market and, thus, global fuel prices.1 The third indirect land use change (ILUC) effect is caused by the adverse effect of biofuels production on food prices and resulting expansion of cropland on carbon-rich non-agricultural land in the rest of the world (ROW; see Khanna & Crago, forthcoming; Khanna, Crago, & Black, 2011).

The results show multiple benefits both for local sustainable development and for mitigating global climate change. The benefits of industrial energy efficiency in South Africa include significant reductions in local air pollutants; improved environmental health; creation of additional jobs; reduced electricity demand; and delays in new investments in electricity generation. The co-benefit of reducing GHG emissions could result in a reduction of as much as 5% of SA's total projected energy CO2 emissions by 2020.

The combined organic/mineral fertilizer application, commonly used as local farming practice, resulted in relatively high seasonal averages of methane emission rates (26.5 mg CH4 m\u22122 h\u22121 in early rice and 50.1 mg CH4 m\u22122 h\u22121 in late rice).

Interpretation of the results can be obtained from the different potentials of these fertilizers for methane production. Based on this concept the different methane emission rates observed with organic/mineral, pure mineral and pure unfermented-organic fertilizers could directly be attributed to the different quantities of organic matter incorporated into the soil. The low methane emission from the plot treated with fermented material could be explained by a depletion of potential methane precursors resulting from the preceding fermentation.

Cordierite based wall-flow filters with high filtration efficiency, low p and good thermal durability are the product of choice for these applications. Continuous passive oxidation of the soot by NO2 is desired, however under certain operating and ambient conditions periodic active oxidation of the soot at elevated temperatures (>550oC) is required. A part of the PM emissions of the engine contains noncombustible contributions (ashes). These materials accumulate in the filter over lifetime, resulting in an increase in pressure drop as well as a reduction of the filter volume available for soot accumulation. As the pressure drop rises above manageable levels from a performance perspective, ash cleaning of the filter is required. The ash storage capacity of the filter determines the service interval for the filter. Long service intervals are desired by the end customer. To mitigate the impact of the ash accumulation in the filter, Corning Incorporated has developed filters with the proprietary asymmetric cell technology (ACT), providing high ash capacity with good strength attributes. These filters have larger inlet and smaller outlet channels and therefore a higher volume available for ash storage. The present work summarizes the results of on-engine (HD) ash testing on uncoated Robust Cordierite (RC) filters \u2013 O267mmX305mm (O10.5\u201dx12\u201d) in both Standard (200/19) and ACT (270/16) design configurations. The work demonstrates, for an equal size filter a 30% improved ash storage capacity and therefore longer service interval for the ACT design over the standard filter. Good durability of the filters for a long operation timeframe (up to 2700h) was demonstrated. Furthermore the paper summarizes a wide set of post testing evaluations, both non-destructive and destructive to understand the ash distribution and interactions in the filter. INTRODUCTION Due to their high efficiency, excellent power output and good durability aspects diesel engines have been selected as the most attractive propulsion system in key sectors of the economy. With the increase in fuel costs and further improvements in diesel engine technology the expansion of diesel engine technology in other application segments is anticipated. On the other hand the ever tightening emissions regulations require significant reduction in the tailpipe emissions. For example the US HDD on road emissions legislation requires 90% reduction in PM emissions by 2007(relative to 2006 PM limits) and 80% reduction in NOx by 2010 (relative to 2009 NOx limits). The lower emissions are achieved by improvements in engine technology and the use of advanced emissions technologies. Diesel Particulate filters are required for achieving the low PM emissions levels to meet the 2007 US on-road regulations. It is expected that the 2010 NOx limits will be achieved by further advancements in engine technology, improved controls and implementation of DeNOx technology in the form of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system or Lean NOx Traps (LNT) or a combination of both. Cordierite wall flow monoliths have emerged as the choice of the industry for use as diesel particulate filters (DPFs) due to their compactness and robust design. The design of diesel particulate emissions systems requires balancing of various competing constraints. On the one hand the soot capacity of the filter needs to be sufficiently high to enable the desired regeneration intervals. The soot capacity is driven by the filter volume, the regeneration conditions and control strategy. On the other hand engine back pressure needs to be managed. This includes management of clean and life-time pressure drop for optimized performance of the engine. Corning\u2019s Robust Cordierite (RC) material was developed for medium and heavy duty OEMs and retrofit applications. It provides good soot loading capacity, low pressure drop and excellent durability and strength. 2007-01-0920 Improved Lifetime Pressure Drop Management for Robust Cordierite (RC) Filters with Asymmetric Cell Technology (ACT) Krishna Aravelli and Achim Heibel Corning Incorporated, Diesel Technologies Development", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "59566cae4148bb2a83dada21096ae3ef0b938e58", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1961423172", "DOI": "10.2308/ACCR-51307", "CorpusId": 220431742}, "title": "The Effect of Target Difficulty on Target Completion: The Case of Reducing Carbon Emissions", "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Targets are an integral component of management control systems and play a significant role in achieving desirable performance outcomes.

Understanding the components of C02 emissions, particularly those related to combustion of fossil fuels, is important for judging the likely success of plans for dealing with future emissions. Knowing how fuel switching, changes in economic activity and its structure, or changes in energy-use efficiency affected emissions in the past, we can better judge both the realism of national proposals to restrain future emissions and the outcome as well. This study presents a first step in that analysis. The organization of this paper is as follows. We present a brief background and summarize previous work analyzing changes in energy use using the factorial method. We then describe our data sources and method. We then present a series of summary results, including a comparison of C02 emissions in 1991 by end use or sector. We show both aggregate change and change broken down by factor, highlighting briefly the main components of change. We then present detailed results, sector by sector. Next we highlight recent trends. Finally, we integrate our results, discussing -the most important factors driving change - evolution in economic structure, changes in energy intensities, and shifts in the fuel mix. We discuss briefly some of the likely causes of these changes - long- term technological changes, effects of rising incomes, the impact of overall changes in energy prices, as well as changes in the relative prices of energy forms.", "year": 1996}, {"paperId": "fe76488dfaf0f34f0b1a4856a0010f782884db73", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2164927380", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-10-7439-2010", "CorpusId": 53586850}, "title": "A global modeling study on carbonaceous aerosol microphysical characteristics and radiative effects", "abstract": "Abstract. Recently, attention has been drawn towards black carbon aerosols as a short-term climate warming mitigation candidate. However the global and regional impacts of the direct, indirect and semi-direct aerosol effects are highly uncertain, due to the complex nature of aerosol evolution and the way that mixed, aged aerosols interact with clouds and radiation. A detailed aerosol microphysical scheme, MATRIX, embedded within the GISS climate model is used in this study to present a quantitative assessment of the impact of microphysical processes involving black carbon, such as emission size distributions and optical properties on aerosol cloud activation and radiative effects. Our best estimate for net direct and indirect aerosol radiative flux change between 1750 and 2000 is \u22120.56 W/m2. However, the direct and indirect aerosol effects are quite sensitive to the black and organic carbon size distribution and consequential mixing state. The net radiative flux change can vary between \u22120.32 to \u22120.75 W/m2 depending on these carbonaceous particle properties at emission. Taking into account internally mixed black carbon particles let us simulate correct aerosol absorption. Absorption of black carbon aerosols is amplified by sulfate and nitrate coatings and, even more strongly, by organic coatings. Black carbon mitigation scenarios generally showed reduced radiative fluxeswhen sources with a large proportion of black carbon, such as diesel, are reduced; however reducing sources with a larger organic carbon component as well, such as bio-fuels, does not necessarily lead to a reduction in positive radiative flux.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "2d79c4943433592e98adf97014b6652aa04d5824", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2267013715", "CorpusId": 112003931}, "title": "NO\u2093 Control Technologies for Euro 6 Diesel Passenger Cars: Market Penetration and Experimental Performance Assessment", "abstract": "New diesel passenger cars in the European Union must meet a nitrogen oxides (NO\u2093) emission limit of 80 mg/km over the light-duty vehicle emission certification cycle.

This study aims to quantify the life cycle environmental impacts of IHW landfilling and incineration in China, to identify its key factors, to improve its potential effects, and to establish a hazardous waste disposal inventory.MethodsLife cycle assessment was conducted using the ReCiPe model to estimate the environmental impact of IHW landfilling and incineration. The characterization factors for the human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity categories shown in the ReCiPe were updated based on the geographies, population, food intake, and environmental conditions in China.Results and discussionThe overall environmental burden was mainly attributed to the carcinogen category. The national carcinogen burden in 2014 at 37.8 CTUh was dominated by diesel consumption, cement and sodium hydroxide production, direct emission, transportation, and electricity generation stages caused by direct mercury and arsenic emissions, as well as indirect chromium emission. Although the atmospheric mercury emission directly caused by IHW incineration was comparative with the emission levels of developed countries, the annual direct mercury emission accounted for approximately 0.1% of the national mercury emission.ConclusionsThe key factors contributing to the reduction of the national environmental burden include the increasing diesel and electricity consumption efficiency, the reduction of cement and sodium hydroxide use, the development of air pollutant controlling systems, the reduction of transport distance between IHW disposers to suppliers, and the improvement of IHW recycling and reuse technologies.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "13d5193066b660f011304c6dd1cc8027b5badb25", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1972567192", "DOI": "10.1021/es305093c", "CorpusId": 24963913, "PubMed": "24328118"}, "title": "Effectiveness of a segmental approach to climate policy.", "abstract": "Resistance to adopting a cap on greenhouse gas emissions internationally, and across various national contexts, has encouraged alternative climate change mitigation proposals. These proposals include separately targeting clean energy uptake and demand-side efficiency in individual end-use sectors, an approach to climate change mitigation which we characterize as segmental and technology-centered. A debate has ensued on the detailed implementation of these policies in particular national contexts, but less attention has been paid to the general factors determining the effectiveness of a segmental approach to emissions reduction. We address this topic by probing the interdependencies of segmental policies and their collective ability to control emissions. First, we show for the case of U.S. electricity how the set of suitable energy technologies depends on demand-side efficiency, and changes with the stringency of climate targets. Under a high-efficiency scenario, carbon-free technologies must supply 60-80% of U.S. electricity demand to meet an emissions reduction target of 80% below 1990 levels by midcentury. Second, we quantify the enhanced propensity to exceed any intended emissions target with this approach, even if goals are set on both the supply and demand side, due to the multiplicative accumulation of emissions error. For example, a 10% error in complying with separate policies on the demand and supply side would combine to result in a 20% error in emissions. Third, we discuss why despite these risks, the enhanced planning capability of a segmental approach may help counteract growing infrastructural inertia. The emissions reduction impediment due to infrastructural inertia is significant in the electricity sectors of each of the greatest emitters: China, the U.S., and Europe. Commonly cited climate targets are still within reach but, as we show, would require more than a 50% reduction in the carbon intensity of new power plants built in these regions over the next decade.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "be45c4e9c0fab2c8c941e75819adfccdb0d67eff", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1978956205", "DOI": "10.1104/PP.70.2.437", "CorpusId": 34099355, "PubMed": "16662511"}, "title": "Resistance to injury by sulfur dioxide : correlation with its reduction to, and emission of, hydrogen sulfide in Cucurbitaceae.", "abstract": "In Cucurbitaceae young leaves are resistant to injury from acute exposure to SO(2), whereas mature leaves are sensitive.

Young leaves emit H(2)S many times more rapidly than do mature leaves. Young leaves convert approximately 10% of absorbed [(35)S]SO(2) to emitted [(35)S]H(2)S, but mature leaves convert less than 2%.
