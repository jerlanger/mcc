The Chinese steel industry is becoming a key domestic emitter of sulfur dioxide (SO2), the central molecular component of acid rain. In this study SO2 emission potential is assessed by developing a material flow analysis (MFA) model and generating four different SO2 industry emission scenarios from 2006 to 2030, with each scenario representing a possible development path for the industry. When SO2 emission factors in every unit of steel production are presumed to remain constant through 2030, scenario analysis results show that under a business\u2010as\u2010usual (BAU) scenario SO2 emissions will experience sustained growth to a peak value of 1.73 million metric tons (megatons, Mt) through 2020, approximately 52% higher than that in 2006, and that this trend is unlikely to be reversed. The high scenario and medium scenario demonstrate that it is difficult to control SO2 emissions to an acceptable level by only upgrading technology and making industrial structural adjustments. Yet through the incorporation of sintering gas desulfurization, the low scenario can smoothly bridge the gap between the simulative SO2 emissions and the envisioned value, since sintering is the biggest emitter in this industry. Once the desulfurization rate of sintering gas reaches 60%, SO2 emissions will be less than the level of 0.60 Mt in 2030 and will also meet the reduction goals. Moreover, scenario analysis suggests that single terminal control cannot solve the problem of high SO2 emissions. Therefore, in order to control the total SO2 emissions of the steel industry it is imperative that two or more measures be combined.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "493efe73081dacca227692ee70a5e6ef3fb8808b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2171829441", "DOI": "10.1038/NGEO1529", "CorpusId": 33123391}, "title": "Reduction in carbon uptake during turn of the century drought in western North America", "abstract": "The severity and incidence of climatic extremes, including drought, have increased as a result of climate warming.

The absorption potential of agricultural soils could contribute significantly to constraining growth in greenhouse gas emissions, while also contributing to improvements in soil quality in some areas. In addition to the measures listed above, other benefits of compost application may have some relevance. Some of these measures include replacement of chemical fertilizers (implying avoidance of greenhouse gases related to their production) reduced use of pesticides (avoiding emissions associated with their production), improved tilth and workability (less consumption of fuels). Typically, life-cycle analyses (LCAs) exhibit limitations related to assessing the effects of `time-limited' carbon sequestration in soils.

The contaminants were polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and polycyclic musks (PCMs). Loadings were calculated from measured concentrations for three major pathways: atmospheric processes, tributary runoff, and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluents. Although atmospheric deposition to the Great Lakes has received the greatest attention, this was the dominant loading pathway for PCBs only (17 \u00b1 5.3 kg/y or 66% of total loadings). PCB loadings reflected elevated urban PCB air concentrations due to, predominantly, primary emissions. These loadings contribute to consumption advisories for nearshore fish. PBDE loadings to the lake, again from mainly primary emissions, were 48% (9.1 \u00b1 1.3 kg/y) and 42% (8.0 \u00b1 5.7 kg/y) via tributaries and WWTPs, respectively, consistent with emissions deposited and subsequently washed-off of urban surfaces and emissions to the sewage system.

The stability limits of these flames are extremely wide as compared to any other method of flame stabilization. This study is part of the Japan national project directed to develop advanced industrial furnace designs that provide approximately 30% energy savings and hence CO 2 reduction, 30% reduction in the furnace size, and 25% reduction of pollutants including NO x as compared to current designs. The objective here is to establish conditions that permit significant reduction in energy consumption, high efficiency, and low pollution from a range of furnaces. Data have been obtained on mean flame temperature and temperature fluctuations, flame emission spectra, emission intensity of C 2 and CH species from within the flames, and overall pollutant emission from the flames. The uniformity of temperature in the furnace was found to be far greater with low oxygen concentration combustion air preheated to 1000\u00b0C as compared to that obtained with roomtemperature air or that found in conventional flames. Emission of NO x and CO was much lower with combustion air preheated to high temperatures with low oxygen concentration. The chemiluminescence intensity of CH and C 2 radicals is significantly affected by the preheat temperature of the combustion air and oxygen concentration in the oxidant. The flame signatures revealed important flame characteristics under high-temperature air combustion conditions. The advantages of utilizing highly preheated combustion air (in excess of 1000\u00b0C) in various types of furnaces are given. The new and advanced furnace design utilizes high-efficiency regenerators and behaves essentially as a well-stirred reactor with uniform thermal and chemical characteristics.

The International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from existing vessels by 20\u201350% by 2050 and develop the Energy Efficiency Operational Indicator (EEOI) as a measure for energy efficiency. To achieve this goal, IMO has suggested three basic approaches: the enlargement of vessel size, the reduction of voyage speed, and the application of new technologies. In recent times, liners have adopted slow steaming and decelerated the voyage speed to 15\u201318 knots on major routes. This is because slow steaming is helpful in reducing operating costs and GHG emissions. However, it also creates negative effects that influence the operating costs and the amount of GHG emissions at the same time. This study started with the basic question: Is it true that as voyage speed reduces, the operating costs and CO2 emissions can be reduced at the same time? If this is true, liners will definitely decelerate their voyage speed themselves as much as possible so that they can increase their profits and improve the level of environmental performance. However, if this is not true, then liners will concentrate just on increasing their profits by not considering environmental factors. This led the authors to set out three objectives: (1) to analyze the relationship between voyage speed and the amount of CO2 emissions and to estimate the changes by slow steaming in liner shipping; (2) to analyze the relationship between voyage speed and the operating costs on a loop; and (3) to find the optimal voyage speed as a solution to maximize the reduction of CO2 emissions at the lowest operating cost, thus satisfying the reduction target of IMO.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "8b6276ecd64684e45c21164430b158cb856bec24", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2058887402", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-011-0034-8", "CorpusId": 53076068}, "title": "Household perceptions of climate change and preferences for mitigation action: the case of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in Australia", "abstract": "The study aims to reveal Australian households\u2019 perceptions of climate change and their preferences for mitigation action.

However, with this change in combustion air composition, especially the reduced concentration of oxygen, the combustion process will be affected. The lower oxygen concentration decreases the stability and the increased amount of CO2, H2O and N2 will decrease the combustion temperature and thus, the NOx emissions. Testing has been performed on a 65 kW gas turbine combustor, to investigate the effect of adding N2, CO2 and O2 in the combustion process, with focus on stability and emissions of NOx. Results show that adding N2 and CO2 decreases the NOx emissions, whereas O2 addition increases the NOx emissions. The tests have been performed both in a diffusion flame (pilot burner) and a premixed flame (main burner), and for additives being injected with the fuel or with the air stream.

Traditional approaches to energy reduction look at direct emissions savings, and recommend insulation and efficiency as more cost-effective than microgeneration. However, microgeneration has indirect, \u2018soft\u2019 benefits and could play a significant role in emissions reduction. Current uptake of microgeneration in the UK is low, with various barriers\u2014economic, technical, cultural, behavioural and institutional\u2014both to uptake and to maximising energy and emissions savings once installed. Subsidies and spreading information alone do not guarantee maximising uptake, and even if successful, this is not enough to maximise savings. The industry focuses on maximising sales, with no incentives to ensure best installations and use; householders do not have access to the best information, and user behaviour does not maximise energy and emission savings. This is related to a broader state of socio-technical \u2018lock-in\u2019 in domestic energy use; there\u2019s a lack of connection between personal behaviour and energy consumption, let alone global climate change. This suggests that a major cultural\u2013behavioural shift is needed to reduce energy/emissions in the home. Transition theory and strategic niche management provide insights into possible systemic change and a suitable framework for future policies, such as supporting a variety of radically innovative niches, both technological and social. Microgeneration, properly employed, has the potential to play a part in such a transition by increasing awareness and energy literacy and empowering people to seriously engage in energy debates as producers, as well as consumers, of energy. This deeper understanding and heightened responsibility are crucial in a shift toward bottom-up emission-reducing behaviour change and better acceptance of top-down energy-saving policy measures, as part of a new domestic energy paradigm. The implications for policy are that, as well as supporting the technologies, it needs to support existing niches and to develop new niche experiments.

A paradigm shift is needed in developing new ways by which energy is supplied and utilized, together with the mitigation of climate change through CO2 reduction technologies. There is an almost universal acceptance of the link between rising anthropogenic CO2 levels due to fossil fuel combustion and global warming accompanied by unpredictable climate change. Therefore, renewable energy, non-fossil fuels and CO2 capture and storage (CCS) must be deployed on a massive scale. CCS technologies provide a means for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, in addition to the current strategies of improving energy efficiency. Coal-fired power plants are among the main large-scale CO2 emitters, and capture of the CO2 emissions can be achieved with conventional technologies such as amine absorption. However, this energy-consuming process, calculated at approximately 30% of the power plant capacity, would result in unacceptable increases in power generation costs. Membrane processes offer a potentially viable energy-saving alternative for CO2 capture because they do not involve any phase transformation. However, typical gas separation membranes that are currently available have insufficiently high permeability to be able to process the massive volumes of flue gas, which would result in a high CO2 capture. Polymer membranes highly permeable to CO2 and having good selectivity should be developed for the membrane process to be viable. This perspective review summarizes recent noteworthy advances in polymeric materials having very high CO2 permeability and good CO2/N2 selectivity that largely surpass the separation performance of conventional polymer materials. Five important classes of polymer membrane materials are highlighted: polyimides, thermally rearranged polymers (TRs), substituted polyacetylenes, polymers with intrinsic microporosity (PIM) and polyethers, which provide insights into polymer designs suitable for CO2 separation from, for example, the post-combustion flue gases in coal-fired power plants.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "afa0b822b6c5f6136acd7a9147544d40cc9b6346", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2157569325", "DOI": "10.1364/OL.28.001135", "CorpusId": 36749461, "PubMed": "12879932"}, "title": "Control of the spatiotemporal emission of a broad-area semiconductor laser by spatially filtered feedback.", "abstract": "We demonstrate the control of the spatiotemporal emission dynamics of a broad-area semiconductor laser in an external optical feedback configuration formed by a spatially filtering mirror.

The effects of condensed tannin (CT) in lotus on methane production were also measured. The trials were carried out indoors with sheep held in metabolism crates to enable an accurate measurement of intake and digestibility as well as methane production. Principal findings were a two-fold range in emissions from 11.5g CH 4 /kg dry matter intake (DMI) with lotus to 25.7g CH 4 /kg DMI with pasture and a 16% reduction in methane production due to the CT in lotus. This range in emissions from good quality forages represents a loss of about 7-11% of metabolisable energy and presents a clear direction for future research to better utilise the feeding value of pastures and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture. High quality perennial forages should be used where practical, and researchers need to identify plant parameters responsible for the variation in methane emissions.

The chemical transformation of CO2 requires suitable catalysts that can lower the activation energy barrier, thus minimizing the energy penalty associated with the CO2 reduction reaction. First-row transition metals are potential candidates as catalysts for electrochemical CO2 reduction; however, their high oxygen affinity makes them easy to be oxidized, which could, in turn, strongly affect the catalytic properties of metal-based catalysts. In this work, we propose a strategy to synthesize Ag-Sn electrocatalysts with a core-shell nanostructure that contains a bimetallic core responsible for high electronic conductivity and an ultrathin partially oxidized shell for catalytic CO2 conversion. This concept was demonstrated by a series of Ag-Sn bimetallic electrocatalysts. At an optimal SnOx shell thickness of \u223c1.7 nm, the catalyst exhibited a high formate Faradaic efficiency of \u223c80% and a formate partial current density of \u223c16 mA cm-2 at -0.8 V vs RHE, a remarkable performance in comparison to state-of-the-art formate-selective CO2 reduction catalysts. Density-functional theory calculations showed that oxygen vacancies on the SnO (101) surface are stable at highly negative potentials and crucial for CO2 activation. In addition, the adsorption energy of CO2- at these oxygen-vacant sites can be used as the descriptor for catalytic performance because of its linear correlation to OCHO* and COOH*, two critical intermediates for the HCOOH and CO formation pathways, respectively. The volcano-like relationship between catalytic activity toward formate as a function of the bulk Sn concentration arises from the competing effects of favorable stabilization of OCHO* by lattice expansion and the electron conductivity loss due to the increased thickness of the SnOx layer.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "469d3427e7aa7a5bf5b7658e5ebccbbf727d9019", "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "0804.0350", "MAG": "2061378174", "DOI": "10.1088/1126-6708/2008/06/082", "CorpusId": 5166537}, "title": "NLO QCD corrections to tri-boson production", "abstract": "We present a calculation of the NLO QCD corrections for the production of three vector bosons at the LHC, namely ZZZ, W+W\u2212Z, W+ZZ, and W+W\u2212W+ production.

Unutilized scrap tires can be a major source of pollution, and in the past decade Federal and state governments in the United States have encouraged the recycling and reuse of scrap tires in a number of applications, ranging from energy recovery to civil engineering materials to utilization of ground rubber in manufacturing. Life cycle inventory data are collected from primary industry sources as well as published literature, and life cycle impact analysis is performed using the TRACI tool. The results indicate that beneficial reuse of scrap tires, particularly in cement plants and artificial turf, provides reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, air toxics, and water consumption. For example, every metric ton of tire-derived fuel substituted for coal in cement kilns avoids an estimated 543\u00a0kg (CO2 equivalent) of direct and indirect GHG emissions. Taking into account the deductible CO2 from natural rubber, the avoided GHG emissions would be 613 CO2\u00a0kg\u00a0eq. per metric ton. The use of scrap tires for fuel in cement plants provides more reductions in most environmental impact categories compared to other scrap tire applications, excluding application in artificial turf. Although the use of ground rubber for artificial turf offers the greatest environmental emission reductions, it has limited potential for large-scale utilization due to the saturated market for artificial turf.

While the emissions of otto engines could significantly be lowered by three-way catalytic converters, most diesel engines still run without an exhaust gas cleaning system. As a consequence, their particle and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission contributes considerably to the environmental pollution. Forthcoming emission legislation will drastically lower the caps for pollutants. Thus, large efforts are underway to achieve a decrease in the emission of regulated components to levels that lie in the required ranges. Retuning the engine in order to reduce particles and removing NOx from the exhaust gas by a DeNOx system such as a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) system could well be a suitable way to go. Selective catalytic reduction systems are well known for stationary applications and have a proven record of removing NOx from lean exhaust gases. The transfer of this technology to mobile applications, however, still poses certain problems. Available space is limited, the system may not be heavy, and it has to be reliable and easy to maintain. Additionally, the operation mode by definition is dynamic. The goal of this research was to find a way to design efficient control algorithms for given SCR converter systems. They have to allow a maximum NOx reduction while respecting the constraint of a limited mean ammonia slip. Preliminary studies are carried out on a dynamometer with a 6.6-liter diesel engine working at a fixed engine speed. The catalytic converter system consists of an oxidation catalytic converter, a device for the injection of urea solution, and a coated cordierite-type SCR catalytic converter.

Fire emissions estimates have long been based on bottom-up approaches that are not only complex, but also fraught with compounding uncertainties. We present the development of a global gridded (1\u00b0 \u00d7 1\u00b0) emission coefficients (Ce) product for smoke total particulate matter (TPM) based on a top-down approach using coincident measurements of fire radiative power (FRP) and aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensors aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. This new Fire Energetics and Emissions Research version 1.0 (FEER.v1) Ce product has now been released to the community and can be obtained from http://feer.gsfc.nasa.gov/ , along with the corresponding 1-to-1 mapping of their quality assurance (QA) flags that will enable the Ce values to be filtered by quality for use in various applications. The regional averages of Ce values for different ecosystem types were found to be in the ranges of 16\u201321 g MJ\u22121 for savanna and grasslands, 15\u201332 g MJ\u22121 for tropical forest, 9\u201312 g MJ\u22121 for North American boreal forest, and 18\u201326 g MJ\u22121 for Russian boreal forest, croplands and natural vegetation. The FEER.v1 Ce product was multiplied by time-integrated FRP data to calculate regional smoke TPM emissions, which were compared with equivalent emissions products from three existing inventories. FEER.v1 showed higher and more reasonable smoke TPM estimates than two other emissions inventories that are based on bottom-up approaches and already reported in the literature to be too low, but portrayed an overall reasonable agreement with another top-down approach. This suggests that top-down approaches may hold better promise and need to be further developed to accelerate the reduction of uncertainty associated with fire emissions estimation in air-quality and climate research and applications. Results of the analysis of FEER.v1 data for 2004\u20132011 show that 65\u201385 Tg yr\u22121 of TPM is emitted globally from open biomass burning, with a generally decreasing trend over this short time period.

Current political efforts addressing this issue (i.e. emission performance standards in the EU) are directed towards car manufacturers. Concretely, the whole car industry has to comply with an average of 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre between 2012 and 2015, with interim targets. The long-term target for 2020 is an average of 95 grams of CO2 per kilometre (by way of comparison, passenger cars currently emit 160 grams of CO2 per kilometre on average). Manufacturers who exceed the specified standard will have to pay fines. From an economic point of view this measure has to be regarded critically. But given the present EU regulation the question arises as to what the optimal strategy for car manufacturers is. Exceeding the emission standard generates costs (through the payment of fines) { but so does complying with the emission standard (through costly abatement measures). Depending on the amount consumers are willing to pay for a specific reduction in CO2 emissions it could well be optimal for manufacturers to exceed the mandatory standard. This paper focuses on the demand side. It examines whether CO2 emissions per kilometre is a relevant attribute in car choices. Based on a stated preference experiment among potential car buyers from Germany, different mixed logit specifications are estimated. In addition, distributions of willingness to pay measures for an abatement of CO2 emissions are obtained. The results suggest that the emissions performance of a car matters substantially, but its consideration varies heavily across the sampled population. In particular, some evidence on gender, age and education effects on climate concerns is provided.

An LCA was carried out for a simulated farm based on a typical nongrazing dairy production system in Quebec. The LCA was conducted over 6 yr, the typical lifespan of dairy cows in this province. The assessment considered 65 female Holstein calves, of which 60 heifers survived to first calving at 27 mo of age. These animals were subsequently retained for an average of 2.75 lactations. Progeny were also included in the analysis, with bulls and heifers in excess of replacement requirements finished as grain-fed veal (270 kg) at 6.5 mo of age. All cattle were housed indoors and fed forages and grains produced on the same farm.

Lactating cows contributed 64% of total GHG emissions, whereas calves under 12 mo contributed 10% and veal calves only 3%. Allocation of GHG emissions between meat and milk were assessed as (1) 100% allocation to milk, (2) economics, (3) dairy versus veal animals, and (4) International Dairy Federation equation using feed energy demand for meat and milk production. Comparing emissions from dairy versus veal calves resulted in 97% of the emissions allocated to milk. The lowest allocation of emissions to milk (78%) was associated with the International Dairy Federation equation.

Quantification of emission changes is a prerequisite for the assessment of\ncontrol effectiveness in improving air quality. However, the traditional\nbottom-up method for characterizing emissions requires detailed\ninvestigation of emissions data (e.g., activity and other emission\nparameters) that usually takes months to perform and limits timely\nassessments. Here we propose a novel method to address this issue by using a\nresponse model that provides real-time estimation of emission changes based\non air quality observations in combination with emission-concentration\nresponse functions derived from chemical transport modeling. We applied the\nnew method to quantify the emission changes on the North China Plain (NCP)\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown, which overlapped the Spring Festival (also known as Chinese New Year)\nholiday. Results suggest that the anthropogenic emissions of NO2 ,\n SO2 , volatile organic compound (VOC) and primary PM 2.5 on the NCP were reduced by 51\u2009%, 28\u2009%,\n67\u2009% and 63\u2009%, respectively, due to the COVID-19 shutdown, indicating\nlonger and stronger shutdown effects in 2020 compared to the previous Spring\nFestival holiday. The reductions of VOC and primary PM 2.5 emissions are\ngenerally effective in reducing O3 and PM 2.5 concentrations.\nHowever, such air quality improvements are largely offset by reductions in\n NOx emissions. NOx emission reductions lead to increases in\n O3 and PM 2.5 concentrations on the NCP due to the strongly VOC-limited\nconditions in winter.

This pilot program used on-road remote sensing at two locations to identify repeat gross polluting vehicles. The owners of gross polluters observed at one of the locations were solicited for a free repair program carried out under the direction of the Utah Valley Community College, Auto-Diesel Division. The same two locations were revisited after the repair program had terminated and the vehicle emissions were remeasured. More than 17,000 measurements of over 10,000 individual vehicles were obtained. As observed elsewhere, half of the total carbon monoxide was emitted by only about ten percent of the vehicles. Solicitation letters were sent to 114 owners and 47 vehicles were recruited and repairs attempted. Of the 47 vehicles, 28 were remeasured when the site was revisited at the end of the program. They had improved their measured on-road emissions by more than 50 percent. The vehicles which were identified as gross polluters at the second location - but were not notified of their status - were used as a control group. Their emissions were also reduced, as expected, but only bymore\u00a0\u00bb 14 percent. This pilot program demonstrates carbon monoxide emissions reduction at a cost effectiveness of $200 per ton, not including the cost benefits of gas mileage improvement. Two hundred dollars per ton is lower than many current or proposed mandated programs. The owner's repair cost would more than pay for itself in terms of improved fuel economy. The program would also generate the on-road fleet emissions data necessary to evaluate its effectiveness.

Besides such source-related emissions reductions, agriculture is also expected to help slowing down the CO2 increase in the atmosphere by sequestering part of it in soil organic matter, and by producing suitable biomass as a substitute for fossil fuel.The share of agriculture in the consumption of fossil fuel is comparatively low. Even the high-intensity farming of industrialized countries does not consume more than about 3\u20134.5% of their total energy budget, at least as far as the fuel inputs into primary farm production are concerned. Possible savings are e.g. reduced soil tillage, optimized fertilizer efficiency, improved irrigation techniques and enhanced solar drying. The pertinent literature comes to the optimistic conclusion that by exploiting all these possibilities a 10\u201340% reduction of the present agricultural energy requirements might be achieved. Accordingly, theoretical fuel savings might be in the order of 0.01\u20130.05 Gt C yr\u22121. Although this should be aimed at for many reasons, it unfortunately corresponds to less than 1% of the present overall CO2 release from fossil fuel.Between 0.25 and 1 Gt fossil fuel carbon could theoretically be substituted per year by agricultural biofuels, and 0.06\u20130.25 Gt yr\u22121 by shelterbelts and agroforestry. Together with 25% of the crop residues, this comes to a potential fossil fuel offset of somewhere between 0.5 and 1.5 Gt C yr\u22121. This would be an impressive figure, suggesting a potential saving of 10\u201325%, while providing the same amount of energy without enriching the atmosphere with much additional CO2. In reality, however, there remain lots of questions as yet unsolved, in addition to many environmental problems which one would have to expect. As an example, a concomitant increase of non-CO2 greenhouse gases can not be ruled out. Furthermore, the use of crop residues as biofuels, even though it is customary in many developing countries, could have deleterious effects on soil fertility.Land use changes from forest or grassland to arable agriculture have been and still are a significant source for the release of former plant and soil carbon into the atmosphere. The reasons for decreasing soil carbon contents are a reduced input of plant biomass into cropland on the one hand, and an accelerated decomposition of the existing organic matter in agricultural soils on the other. The combined losses from the earth's native biomass and from soils due to cultivation between the year 1700 and today amount to about 170 Gt carbon, which is now largely in the atmosphere. A further CO2 emission in the range of 1.2 Gt C per year is still going on due to additional land clearing for agriculture in the tropics. The only way to escape from this forest conversion is a more sustainable use and improved productivity of the already existing farmland.Soil organic matter of cropland increases only if either the additions can be enhanced or the decomposition rates be reduced. There are opportunities by which such improvements can be achieved. Taking the global historical loss of about 42 Gt former soil C from mineral soils as a reference, and assuming a practically feasible restoration by one half to two thirds, this would correspond to somewhere between 20 and 30 Gt C altogether, or to an average CO2 offset of 0.4\u20130.6 Gt C yr\u22121. The drawback, however, is that this carbon-sink option is of limited duration only. The humus enrichment in crop soil always follows a saturation curve, approaching a new equilibrium level after not more than 50\u2013100 years. Furthermore, this new soil carbon level drops rapidly again, as soon as the required most careful management can no longer be sustained.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "4d65b6fb12404656520e48a987147ee99cd468c5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2114519071", "DOI": "10.1579/0044-7447-31.2.88", "CorpusId": 37778281, "PubMed": "12078014"}, "title": "Nitrogen Use in the United States from 1961\u20132000 and Potential Future Trends", "abstract": "Abstract Nitrogen inputs to the US from human activity doubled between 1961 and 1997, with most of the increase in the 1960s and 1970s.

Offset options include scrubbing, fuel switching, investments in energy conservation and efficiency, and afforestation. Costs per ton ofC02 sequestered range from $1.35 for planting shade trees to $59.41 for scrubbing. All options except scrubbing cost less than $11.00, and the median cost is around $6.00 per ton removed. Planting trees on erodible cropland in conjunction with the Conservation Reserve Program combines the goals of reduced erosion, surplus agricultural production, and greenhouse warming. This policy is a first sane step toward reducing the accumulation of greenhouse gases. Having an international framework for managing emissions is most desirable.

To explore the role of plants as mediators of these emissions, we tested whether and how N2O emissions are dependent on grass species richness and/or specific grass species composition in the absence and presence of urine deposition. We hypothesized that: (i) N2O emissions relate negatively to plant productivity; (ii) four\u2010species mixtures have lower emissions than monocultures (as they are expected to be more productive); (iii) emissions are lowest in combinations of species with diverging root morphology and high root biomass; and (iv) the identity of the key species that reduce N2O emissions is dependent on urine deposition.

(Fa), Phleum pratense L. (Php) and Poa trivialis L. (Pt), and quantified N2O emissions for 42 days. We found no relation between plant species richness and N2O emissions. However, N2O emissions were significantly reduced in specific plant species combinations. In the absence of urine, plant communities of Fa+Php acted as a sink for N2O, whereas the monocultures of these species constituted a N2O source. With urine application Lp+Pt plant communities reduced (P < 0.001) N2O emissions by 44% compared to monocultures of Lp. Reductions in N2O emissions by species mixtures could be explained by total biomass productivity and by complementarity in root morphology.

Selection of specific grass species combinations in the context of the expected nitrogen deposition regimes may therefore provide a key for mitigation of N2O emissions.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "3b28c8a952ee528504deb75882e7a0adb53f7a67", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2012742523", "DOI": "10.1142/S2010007815500190", "CorpusId": 153330733}, "title": "How Much Carbon Pricing is in Countries' Own Interests?

Limits on the axion mass and interaction strength are thereby relaxed to values less restrictive than limits previously thought to be firm. For the case of the Sun the Primakoff rate is reduced by two orders of magnitude. This process is the dominant emission mechanism for Kim-Shifman-Vainshtein-Zakharov- (KSVZ) type axions which do not couple directly to electrons. The mass limit is then relaxed by an order of magnitude to m/sub a/<20 eV. Dine-Fischler-Srednicki (DFS) axions couple directly to electrons and the dominant solar emission process becomes bremsstrahlung from electron-nucleus and electron-electron collisions while the previously thought dominant Primakoff rate is now suppressed. The mass limit accidentally remains at m/sub a/<3 eV. Model-dependent bounds based on axion emission from red giants are m/sub a/<1 eV (KSVZ) and m/sub a/<0.06 eV (DFS).

Whereas reductions in NOx (oxide of nitrogen) emissions have decreased nitrate and PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter \u22642.5 \u03bcm) concentrations in the Basin during the past decade, ozone levels have increased at the central basin locations since about 2005 following a reversal in the decline of volatile organic compound (VOC)/NOx ratios during the previous two decades. A chemical box model was used to simulate the effects of changes in precursor concentrations on ozone formation using day-of-week\u2013specific initial precursor concentrations that were derived from measurements and projected to 2020 based on expected emission reductions from 2005 (\u221210% VOC and\u2009\u221250% NOx). Results show that peak ozone formation rates in 2020 will increase on weekdays by a factor of 3 relative to 2005 and will be comparable to 1995 weekday and 2005 Sunday rates. Ozone production will become precursor limited on Sundays in 2020, but with higher initial rates than 2005. Although a greater NOx reduction scenario in 2020 of\u2009\u221275% will result in even higher initial ozone formation rates, precursor limitation is reached quickly, leading to a further shift westward in the location of peak ozone levels. However, ozone levels will likely be lower in downwind areas where transport is more important than local production of ozone. The ambient versus emission inventory reconciliation indicates a factor of 2 underestimation of VOC emissions in 2009 relative to NOx. Other analyses suggest that there is an overall increase in VOC emissions on hot days that is not fully accounted for by emission inventory estimates. Air quality models using emission inventories that underestimate VOC emissions relative to NOx may lead to inaccurate forecasting of the consequence of emission reductions. Implications: The rate and efficiency of ozone formation and accumulation in the SoCAB is more rapid than would be indicated by air quality model simulations based on the current inventory. Projected reductions in NOx emissions without concurrent reductions in VOC emissions will likely cause ozone to increase during the next decade within central regions of the SoCAB compared with a flat or slightly declining trend in far downwind locations.

Reductions in intakes of meat and dairy products, which account for approximately 40% of food-related emissions, are an inevitable policy option. The present paper assesses, as far as is possible, the risk to nutritional status of such a policy in the context of the part played by these foods in overall health and well-being and their contribution to nutritional status for the major nutrients that they supply. Although meat may contribute to saturated fat intakes and a higher BMI, moderate meat consumption within generally-healthy population groups has no measurable influence on morbidity or mortality. However, high consumption of red and processed meat has been associated with increased risk of colo-rectal cancer and recent advice is to reduce intakes to a maximum of 70 g/d. Such reductions in meat and haem-Fe intake are unlikely to influence Fe status in functional terms. However, overall protein intakes would probably fall, with the potential for intakes to be less than current requirements for the elderly. Whether it is detrimental to health is uncertain and controversial. Zn intakes are also likely to fall, raising questions about child growth that are currently unanswerable. Milk and dairy products, currently specifically recommended for young children and pregnant women, provide 30\u201340% of dietary Ca, iodine, vitamin B12 and riboflavin. Population groups with low milk intakes generally show low intakes and poor status for each of these nutrients. Taken together it would appear that the reductions in meat and dairy foods, which are necessary to limit environmental damage, do pose serious nutritional challenges for some key nutrients.

Early adoption of policy by developed countries leads to the development of new technologies that make it easier for developing countries to reduce pollution as well. Since clean technologies are first developed in the world's leading economies, international trade and foreign investments provide access to these technologies.

However by varying the system, using electricity from wind, improving digester configuration, and by using a vehicle optimized for gaseous fuel, a reduction of 54% was evaluated. Furthermore allowing for 0.6 t carbon sequestration per hectare per annum the reduction increased to 75%.

We report the results of a life cycle assessment (LCA) of Level 4 CAV sensing and computing subsystems integrated into internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) and battery electric vehicle (BEV) platforms. The results indicate that CAV subsystems could increase vehicle primary energy use and GHG emissions by 3-20% due to increases in power consumption, weight, drag, and data transmission. However, when potential operational effects of CAVs are included (e.g., eco-driving, platooning, and intersection connectivity), the net result is up to a 9% reduction in energy and GHG emissions in the base case. Overall, this study highlights opportunities where CAVs can improve net energy and environmental performance.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "095fa34caab745b11de19734033d028cbebb1129", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2788219036", "DOI": "10.1039/C7NR09620H", "CorpusId": 206112630, "PubMed": "29569672"}, "title": "Recent advances in the nanoengineering of electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction.", "abstract": "Emissions of CO2 from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes have been regarded as the dominant cause of global warming. Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR), ideally in aqueous media, could potentially solve this problem by the storage of energy from renewable sources in the form of chemical energy in fuels or value-added chemicals in a sustainable manner. However, because of the sluggish reaction kinetics of the ECR, efficient, selective, and durable electrocatalysts are required to increase the rate this reaction. Despite considerable progress in using bulk metallic electrodes for catalyzing the ECR, greater efforts are still needed to tackle this grand challenge. In this Review, we highlight recent progress in using nanoengineering strategies to promote the electrocatalysts for the ECR. Through these approaches, considerable improvements in catalytic performance have been achieved. An outlook of future developments in applying and optimizing these strategies is also proposed.", "year": 2018}]}
