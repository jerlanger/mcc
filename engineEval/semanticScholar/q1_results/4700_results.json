Arterial plasma concentration of [11C]-carfentanil and its labeled metabolites were determined during each PET study. The value of k3/k4 = Bmax/kd was determined for each subject in the presence and absence of naloxone. There was a significant reduction in the value of k3/k4 from 3.4 \u00b1 0.92 to 0.26 \u00b1 0.13 in the thalamus (p < 0.01) and from 1.8 \u00b1 0.33 to 0.16 \u00b1 0.065 in the frontal cortex (p < 0.001). Mean values of frontal cortex/occipital cortex and thalamus/occipital cortex ratios were determined for the interval 35\u201370 min after injection when receptor binding is high relative to nonspecific binding. The relationship between the measured region/occipital cortex values and the corresponding values of k3/k4 in the presence and absence of naloxone was: regions/occipital cortex = 0.95 + 0.74 (k3/k4) with r = 0.98 (n = 20). Simulation studies also demonstrated a linear relationship between the thalamus/occipital cortex or frontal cortex/occipital cortex ratio and k3/k4 for less than twofold increases or decreases in k3/k4. Simulation studies in which thalamic blood flow was varied demonstrated no significant effect on the region/occipital cortex ratio at 35\u201370 min for a twofold increase or fourfold decrease in blood flow.

The addition of SO2, simulating the effect of coal addition on the flue gas composition, resulted in significant reductions in the TEQ emissions due to reactions involving SO2 in the postcombustion zone. However, emissions of total PCDDs/Fs, unlike the TEQ value, were dependent upon the Cl2 and SO2 injection temperatures due to increases in non-TEQ correlated isomers. The conversion of metal chlorides in the fly ash to sulfates, thus reducing the sites responsible for chlorination/oxidation reactions, was concluded to be the main suppressant mechanism; proposed reactions for copper and iron are presented.

Results show that growth rates of CO and NMVOC emissions slowed down, but NOx and PM10 emissions continued rising rapidly for the period 2006\u20132009. Moreover, CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in 2009 almost doubled compared to those in 2005. Characteristics of recent spatial distribution of emissions and emission contributions by vehicle category revealed that priority of vehicular emission control should be put on the eastern and southeastern coastal provinces and northern regions, and passenger cars and motorcycles require stricter control for the reduction of CO and NMVOC emissions, while effective reduction of NOx and PM10 emissions can be achieved by better control of heavy-duty vehicles, buses and coaches, and passenger cars. Explicit provincial-level Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis, which quantified for the first time the Chinese vehicular emission uncertainties associated with both COPERT-derived and domestically measured emission factors by vehicle technology, showed that CO, NMVOC, and NOx emissions for the period 2006\u20132009 were calculated with the least uncertainty, followed by PM10 and CO2, despite relatively larger uncertainties in N2O and CH4 emissions. The quantified low uncertainties of emissions revealed a necessity of applying vehicle technology- and vehicle age-specific dynamic emission factors for vehicular emission estimation, and these improved methodologies are applicable for routine update and forecast of China's on-road motor vehicle emissions. Implications: This paper tracks the temporal and spatial variation characteristics in recent vehicular emission inventories in China based on dynamic emission factors. The fact that CO and NMVOC emissions kept growing at reduced rates and the NOx, PM10, and GHG emissions continued rising rapidly reveals that it was insufficient to bring down the rapid growth of NOx, PM10, and CO2 emissions by merely tightening emission standards and improving fuel quality of motor vehicles. The results will assist decision makers to formulate effective control policies for China's vehicular emissions.

However, certain criteria must be met before widespread acceptance of such a system could be achieved. In particular, it is essential that odour and ammonia emissions and damage to the growing crop are minimized. The most promising way forward appears to be placement of the bio-solids below the soil surface using tine injectors. The performance of a shallow winged injector tine with an integral cutting edge, developed at Silsoe College, which is capable of operating effectively at depths of between 50 and 80 mm, was compared with the Greentrac slipper foot shallow injector tine fitted with a disc cutter. Trials were conducted both in the soil dynamics laboratory, to observe force and disturbance characteristics, and in the field to investigate odour and ammonia emissions following the application of anaerobically digested sewage sludge in November into winter wheat, and pig slurry in May into spring wheat. Investigations in the soil dynamics laboratory showed that draught forces were comparable between tines, (approximately 0\u00b75 kN at 50 mm depth); however a 30% reduction in the vertical force required to enable the improved injector tine to penetrate and maintain the desired working depth was observed compared with the slipper foot tine. This characteristic is critical in the design of a full-sized machine where a large operating width is desirable in order to minimize the area of land trafficked during the injection operation. In addition, the wings on the improved injector tine were found to promote greater soil mixing, resulting in lower surface exposure of bio-solids following application. Results suggest that odour emissions, following a typical application of anaerobically digested sewage sludge to arable land in November, are sufficiently low [80\u2013120 odour units (ou)/m2] as to present no difficulties for the proposed disposal system regardless of the method of application, and reductions in ammonia emissions of up to 80%, (300 mgNH3N/m2), may be possible using the improved injection system over the Greentrac slipper foot injector. Results from an application in May, using a stronger source (pig slurry), indicate that a 60% reduction in odour, significant at the 85% level of confidence, can be achieved through the adoption of the improved injection system. Similarly, ammonia volatilization following the same application was significantly reduced (>1000 mg NH3N/m2) by the use of a shallow injection method (at the 95% level of confidence) compared with surface application. The results from the May application indicate a significant trend towards further reductions (up to 200 mg NH3N/m2) in ammonia emissions using the improved injector tine.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "0d41be564d6a7310d1c13691cf861d836bf6a5f3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2736252341", "DOI": "10.1038/nature23016", "CorpusId": 4466165, "PubMed": "28723895"}, "title": "Visible-light-driven methane formation from CO2 with a molecular iron catalyst", "abstract": "Converting CO2 into fuel or chemical feedstock compounds could in principle reduce fossil fuel consumption and climate-changing CO2 emissions. One strategy aims for electrochemical conversions powered by electricity from renewable sources, but photochemical approaches driven by sunlight are also conceivable. A considerable challenge in both approaches is the development of efficient and selective catalysts, ideally based on cheap and Earth-abundant elements rather than expensive precious metals. Of the molecular photo- and electrocatalysts reported, only a few catalysts are stable and selective for CO2 reduction; moreover, these catalysts produce primarily CO or HCOOH, and catalysts capable of generating even low to moderate yields of highly reduced hydrocarbons remain rare. Here we show that an iron tetraphenylporphyrin complex functionalized with trimethylammonio groups, which is the most efficient and selective molecular electro- catalyst for converting CO2 to CO known, can also catalyse the eight-electron reduction of CO2 to methane upon visible light irradiation at ambient temperature and pressure. We find that the catalytic system, operated in an acetonitrile solution containing a photosensitizer and sacrificial electron donor, operates stably over several days. CO is the main product of the direct CO2 photoreduction reaction, but a two-pot procedure that first reduces CO2 and then reduces CO generates methane with a selectivity of up to 82 per cent and a quantum yield (light-to-product efficiency) of 0.18 per cent.

The algorithm could be used to find many solutions that could improve existing routing on both cost and emissions metrics, reduce emissions by an average of almost 6%, and reduce costs by an average of 9%.

It reviews commentary and critiques of the government's substitute Direct Action (DA) policy and its capacity to reduce emissions. The views of the international community on the Abbott government's repositioning of Australia's climate policy are considered, as are the prospects of achieving effective emissions reduction policy under Abbott's successor, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The paper notes the role of the Senate in both assisting and frustrating government reforms, as well as aspects of policy continuity that could see a form of carbon pricing revived in future. It explores the correlation between the political ascension of Tony Abbott and his rejection of carbon pricing, whether his substitute DA mechanism will effectively reduce emissions, and the adequacy of Australia's current global climate policy aspirations.

As such, these catalysts display a remarkably high catalytic activity and stability in the hydrogenation of benzene and toluene (up to 3-24-fold compared with Ru catalysts prepared by traditional methods).

A series of measures have been taken to control vehicle emissions. In this study, we simulate the effects of the major vehicle control policies implemented in China and those to be implemented in the future by performing scenario analyses. As a result of the three stages of vehicle emission standards (states I, II, and III), the average emission factors (g/km) of light-duty gasoline vehicles in China for carbon monoxide (CO), volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter measuring less than 2.5\u00a0\u03bcm in diameter were reduced by 78, 88, 90, and 85\u00a0%, respectively, between 2000 and 2012. Those of heavy-duty diesel vehicles were reduced by 66, 65, 30, and 67\u00a0%. If no emission standards had been implemented in that period, the levels of vehicle emissions in China would have been increased by two to six times the levels measured in 2000, as of 2012; the standards therefore helped to reduce emissions by 50\u201383\u00a0% between 2000 and 2012 compared to the uncontrolled scenario. In Beijing and Shanghai, where the standards were implemented earlier than in the rest of the country, the standards achieved greater reductions. In the future, if no new measures are taken, vehicle emissions (except CO) will continue to increase until 2020.

Some of these GHGs (e.g., methane) have atmospheric lifetimes of decades or less, whereas others (e.g., carbon dioxide) persist for centuries to millennia. As policy seeks to reduce climate changes, it is important to understand how mitigation of different gases each contributes to this goal. Our study shows that short-lived GHGs contribute to thermal expansion of the ocean over much longer time scales than their atmospheric lifetimes. Actions taken to reduce emissions of short-lived gases could mitigate centuries of additional future sea-level rise. Mitigation of anthropogenic greenhouse gases with short lifetimes (order of a year to decades) can contribute to limiting warming, but less attention has been paid to their impacts on longer-term sea-level rise. We show that short-lived greenhouse gases contribute to sea-level rise through thermal expansion (TSLR) over much longer time scales than their atmospheric lifetimes. For example, at least half of the TSLR due to increases in methane is expected to remain present for more than 200 y, even if anthropogenic emissions cease altogether, despite the 10-y atmospheric lifetime of this gas. Chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons have already been phased out under the Montreal Protocol due to concerns about ozone depletion and provide an illustration of how emission reductions avoid multiple centuries of future TSLR. We examine the \u201cworld avoided\u201d by the Montreal Protocol by showing that if these gases had instead been eliminated in 2050, additional TSLR of up to about 14 cm would be expected in the 21st century, with continuing contributions lasting more than 500 y. Emissions of the hydrofluorocarbon substitutes in the next half-century would also contribute to centuries of future TSLR. Consideration of the time scales of reversibility of TSLR due to short-lived substances provides insights into physical processes: sea-level rise is often assumed to follow air temperature, but this assumption holds only for TSLR when temperatures are increasing. We present a more complete formulation that is accurate even when atmospheric temperatures are stable or decreasing due to reductions in short-lived gases or net radiative forcing.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "ad30fab515202381b1b43e86ab88ddf7cf69fbc6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2119970259", "DOI": "10.1039/C2EE02480B", "CorpusId": 97393931}, "title": "Replacing fossil based PET with biobased PEF; process analysis, energy and GHG balance", "abstract": "An energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) balance study was performed on the production of the bioplastic polyethylene furandicarboxylate (PEF) starting from corn based fructose. The goal of the study was to analyze and to translate experimental data on the catalytic dehydration of fructose to a simulation model, using the ASPEN Plus modeling software. The mass and energy balances of the simulation model results were then used as inputs for a process chain analysis (by application of the life cycle assessment methodology, LCA) and compared to its petrochemical counterpart polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The production of PEF can be divided into three main units: the production of fructose from corn starch; the conversion of fructose into Furanics and subsequent recovery and upgrading; and the oxidation to the monomer 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and polymerization with ethylene glycol (EG) into PEF. The ASPEN Plus simulation model describes the conversion of fructose into Furanics, subsequent recovery and upgrading and a CHP unit. The production of fructose from corn starch and the oxidation and polymerization into PEF were based on the literature. In total, six model cases were analyzed, using different sets of underlying experimental data; four cases based on crystalline fructose and two cases on high fructose corn syrup (HFCS). Fructose can be converted into Furanics at efficiencies between 38% and 47%. The production of PEF can reduce the NREU approximately 40% to 50% while GHG emissions can be reduced approximately 45% to 55%, compared to PET for the system cradle to grave. These reductions are higher than for other biobased plastics, such as polylactic acid (PLA) or polyethylene (PE). With an annual market size of approximately 15 million metric tonnes (Mt) of PET bottles produced worldwide, the complete bottle substitution of PEF for PET would allow us to save between 440 and 520 PJ of non-renewable energy use (NREU) and to reduce GHG emissions by 20 to 35 Mt of CO2 equivalents. If also substantial substitution takes place in the PET fibres and film industry, the savings increase accordingly.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the legislated emission reductions using monitoring data, this paper proposed a two-stage approach for the estimation of regional trends and their standard errors. In the first stage, a generalized model (GAM) is fitted to airborne sulfur dioxide (SO2) data at each of 35 sites in the eastern United States to estimate the form and magnitude of the site-specific trend (defined as percent total change) from 1989 to 1995. This analysis is designed to adjust the SO2 data for the influences of meteorology and season. In the second stage, the estimated trends are treated as samples with site-dependent measurement error from a Gaussian random field with a stationary covariance function. Kriging methodology is adapted to construct spatially-smoothed estimates of the true trend for three large regions in the eastern U.S. Finally, a Bayesian analysis with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods is used to obtain regional trend estimates and their standard errors, which take account of the estimation of the unknown covariance parameters as well as the stochastic variation of the random fields. Both spatial estimation techniques produced similar results in terms of regional trend and standard error.

A variety of publications suggest that emission reductions in rich countries are offset by increased imports, i.e. our national carbon footprint is growing while our territorial emissions are getting smaller. Some refute this claim stating that the methods and data are unreliable, while others acknowledge the issue but argue it is not important for climate policy. This report aims to dispel some myths about carbon footprints and trade-adjusted emission inventories. A review of studies finds large variations between studies of the Nordic countries, but closer inspection shows that many of the variations are due to inconsistent definitions and non-comparable methods. Calculations using a consistent global model provide updated estimates for the Nordic countries in 1997, 2001, and 2004. A general observation for the Nordic countries is that the overall carbon footprint is larger than territorial based emissions, and that the difference is increasing. Further we also observe an increase in the total carbon footprint from 2001 to 2004.

The model characterized the formaldehyde emissions from the paint in three stages: an initial \"puff\" of instant release, a fast decay, and a final stage of slow decay controlled by a solid-phase diffusion process that can last for more than a month.

Mitigation benefits through the use of forest products are affected by product life cycles, which determine the duration of carbon storage in wood products and substitution benefits where emissions are avoided using wood products instead of other emissions\u2010intensive building products and energy fuels. Here we determined displacement factors for wood substitution in the built environment and bioenergy at the national level in Canada. For solid wood products, we compiled a basket of end\u2010use products and determined the reduction in emissions for two functionally equivalent products: a more wood\u2010intensive product vs. a less wood\u2010intensive one. Avoided emissions for end\u2010use products basket were weighted by Canadian consumption statistics to reflect national wood uses, and avoided emissions were further partitioned into displacement factors for sawnwood and panels. We also examined two bioenergy feedstock scenarios (constant supply and constrained supply) to estimate displacement factors for bioenergy using an optimized selection of bioenergy facilities which maximized avoided emissions from fossil fuels. Results demonstrated that the average displacement factors were found to be similar: product displacement factors were 0.54 tC displaced per tC of used for sawnwood and 0.45 tC tC\u22121 for panels; energy displacement factors for the two feedstock scenarios were 0.47 tC tC\u22121 for the constant supply and 0.89 tC tC\u22121 for the constrained supply. However, there was a wide range of substitution impacts. The greatest avoided emissions occurred when wood was substituted for steel and concrete in buildings, and when bioenergy from heat facilities and/or combined heat and power facilities was substituted for energy from high\u2010emissions fossil fuels. We conclude that (1) national\u2010level substitution benefits need to be considered within a systems perspective on climate change mitigation to avoid the development of policies that deliver no net benefits to the atmosphere, (2) the use of long\u2010lived wood products in buildings to displace steel and concrete reduces GHG emissions, (3) the greatest bioenergy substitution benefits are achieved using a mix of facility types and capacities to displace emissions\u2010intensive fossil fuels.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "f973f824f60305974906e2f8004a8d9dbb2e28ba", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2053384708", "DOI": "10.1080/00423119708969353", "CorpusId": 110594885}, "title": "Pantograph/Catenary Dynamics and Control", "abstract": "SUMMARY The pantograph-catenary system with its dynamic behaviour turned out to be a crucial component for new train systems required to run at higher speeds.

Tumor biology research has identified several mechanisms of tumor resistance that may be unique to radiation treatments. These fall into 3 broad areas associated with (1) tumor hypoxic fraction, (2) tumor growth rate, (3) and the intrinsic radiosensitivity of tumor clonogens. Imaging research has markers in various stages of development for quantifying relevant information about each of these mechanisms, and those that measure tumor oxygenation and predict for radioresistance are the most advanced. Positron-emission tomography (PET) measurement of oxygen 15 has yielded important information, particularly about brain tissue perfusion, metabolism, and function. Indirect markers of tumor hypoxia have exploited the covalent binding of bioreductive intermediates of azomycin-containing compounds whose uptakes are inversely proportional to intracellular oxygen concentrations. Pilot clinical studies with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and PET detection of radiolabeled markers to tumor hypoxia have been reported. Recently, other studies have attempted to exploit the reduction properties of both technetium and copper chelates for the selective deposition of radioactive metals in hypoxic tissues. A growing number of potentially useful isotopes are now available for labeling several novel chemicals that could have the appropriate specificity and sensitivity. Preclinical studies with \"microSPECT\" and \"microPET\" will be important to define the optimal radiodiagnostic(s) for measuring tissue oxygenation and for determining the time after their administration for optimal hypoxic signal acquisition.

In 2004, treatments of urea or urea + zeolite\u2010DCD were applied randomly to pairs of plots following grazing in late autumn. Both treatments received urea at a rate of 50 kg N ha\u20101, while the latter treatment also included an application of granular zeolite/DCD at 42 kg ha\u20101 (DCn\u2122: 10 kg ha\u20101 DCD). In 2005, the same treatments were applied following grazing in early and late autumn and early spring. Measurements of N2O emissions were made at frequent intervals following treatment application using a standardised soil cover technique. Large variability in N2O emissions and soil mineral N levels were measured, due to the variable nature of urine N return by grazing animals. Nevertheless, the results clearly showed that the granular zeolite/DCD significantly reduced N2O emissions from grazed pasture from 1.0 to 0.3 kg N ha\u20101, 3.7 to 0.7 kg N ha\u20101 and 2.9 to 0.3 kg N ha\u20101 for the three measurement periods.

Based on these results, and the assumption that 40\u201350% of annual N2O emissions occur during the times when nitrification inhibitor application is recommended, granular zeolite/DCD reduced annual N2O emission from grazed pastures by 30\u201345%.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "263fe2783e7cec76bbcf28055f93632f1efc8a9f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2062684551", "DOI": "10.1039/C3EE42667J", "CorpusId": 111116071}, "title": "Energy demand and emissions of the non-energy sector", "abstract": "The demand for fossil fuels for non-energy purposes such as production of bulk chemicals is poorly understood.

We project that the global gross demand for feedstocks more than triples from 30 EJ in 2010 to over 100 EJ in 2100, mainly due to the increased demand for high value chemicals such as ethylene. Carbon emissions increase disproportionately (from 160 MtC per year in 2010 to over 650 MtC per year in 2100) due to greater use of coal, especially in ammonia and methanol production. If biomass is used, it can supply a large portion of the required primary energy and reduce carbon emissions by up to 20% in 2100 compared to the reference development.

Dopamine projections ascending from the midbrain provide important modulatory input to these striatal subregions. The aim of this study was to compare activation of dopamine D2 receptors after amphetamine administration in the functional subdivisions of the human striatum. D2 receptor availability (V3\u2033) was measured with positron emission tomography and [11C]raclopride in 14 healthy volunteers under control conditions and after the intravenous administration of amphetamine (0.3 mg/kg). For each condition, [11C]raclopride was administered as a priming bolus followed by constant infusion, and measurements of D2 receptor availability were obtained under sustained binding equilibrium conditions. Amphetamine induced a significantly larger reduction in D2 receptor availability (\u0394V3\u2033) in limbic (ventral striatum, \u221215.3 \u00b1 11.8%) and sensorimotor (postcommissural putamen, \u221216.1 \u00b1 9.6%) regions compared with associative regions (caudate and precommissural putamen, \u22128.1 \u00b1 7.2%).

The increase in euphoria reported by subjects after amphetamine was associated with larger \u0394V3\u2033 in the limbic and sensorimotor regions, but not in the associative regions. These results show significant differences in the dopamine response to amphetamine between the functional subdivisions of the human striatum.

In this study, the potential inhibitory effects of sulfide on nitrate, nitrite, and N2O reduction were assessed with a methanol-utilizing denitrifying culture both prior to and after its exposure and adaptation to sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide was found to be strongly inhibitory to N2O reduction, with 50% inhibition observed at H2S concentrations of 0.04 mg H2S-S/L and 0.1 mg H2S-S/L for the unadapted and adapted cultures, respectively. In comparison, both nitrate and nitrite reduction was more tolerant to H2S. A 50% inhibition of nitrite reduction was observed at approximately 2.0 mg H2S-S/L for both unadapted and adapted cultures, while no inhibition of nitrate reduction occurred at the highest H2S concentrations applied (2.0 mg H2S-S/L) to either culture. N2O accumulation was observed during nitrate and nitrite reduction by the adapted culture when H2S concentrations were above 0.5 and 0.2 mg H2S-S/L, respectively. Additionally, we reveal that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), rather than sulfide, was likely the true inhibitor of N2O reduction, and the inhibitory effect was reversible.

The ensemble consists of simulations from two regional climate models (RCMs), both run with boundary conditions from two global models, and for two scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. In northeastern Europe, a general decrease in extreme river discharge is observed in the scenario period, suggesting a reduction in the hazard of extreme snowmelt floods. Elsewhere, we find a consistent tendency toward a higher flood hazard in the majority of the model experiments in several major European rivers. These changes can partly be attributed to large, decadal-scale variability in the simulated climate and can be expected to occur naturally when comparing two 30-year time periods, even without a change in greenhouse gas forcing. We furthermore find evidence for a considerable influence of especially the global model that is used to drive the RCMs. At the scale of individual river basins, using a different combination of climate models or assuming a different emissions scenario sometimes results in a very different or even opposite climate change signal in flood hazard. We therefore believe that a multimodel approach as adopted in the present paper provides the best way to address the various uncertainties in impact studies of hydrometeorological extremes.

The number of vehicles in China has been increasing rapidly. We evaluate the impact of current and possible future vehicle emissions from China on Asian air quality. We modify the Regional Emission Inventory in Asia (REAS) for China's road transport sector in 2000 using updated Chinese data for the number of vehicles, annual mileage, and emission factors. We develop two scenarios for 2020: a scenario where emission factors remain the same as they were in 2000 (No-Policy, NoPol), and a scenario where Euro 3 vehicle emission standards are applied to all vehicles (except motorcycles and rural vehicles). The Euro 3 scenario is an approximation of what may be the case in 2020 as, starting in 2008, all new vehicles in China (except motorcycles) were required to meet the Euro 3 emission standards. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF/Chem), we examine the regional air quality response to China's vehicle emissions in 2000 and in 2020 for the NoPol and Euro 3 scenarios. We evaluate the 2000 model results with observations in Japan, China, Korea, and Russia. Under NoPol in 2020, emissions of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) from China's vehicles more than double compared to the 2000 baseline. If all vehicles meet the Euro 3 regulations in 2020, however, these emissions are reduced by more than 50% relative to NoPol. The implementation of stringent vehicle emission standards leads to a large, simultaneous reduction of the surface ozone (O3) mixing ratios and particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations. In the Euro 3 scenario, surface O3 is reduced by more than 10 ppbv and surface PM2.5 is reduced by more than 10 \u03bcg m\u22123 relative to NoPol in Northeast China in all seasons. In spring, surface O3 mixing ratios and PM2.5 concentrations in neighboring countries are also reduced by more than 3 ppbv and 1 \u03bcg m\u22123, respectively.

When everyday destinations are within walking distance, people are more likely to walk or cycle, and if transit is within walking distance people are more likely to use it. Other studies have shown that compact development enables reductions in building energy consumption that contribute further to emissions savings. The reduced emissions are assumed to rely on the combination of compactness and transit connectedness. However, this combination requires an extensive transit network covering large areas both of residential and of employment destinations. Such networks often do not exist and are too costly to construct. When they do exist, the transit networks often do not reach those outlying neighbourhoods with the greatest potential for future growth and densification. This paper therefore asks what emissions savings compact development can achieve in the absence of high-frequency transit. In an examinination of the life-cycle emissions of four variations of density in three different neighbourhoods in Vancouver, none of which is well served by transit, we found a wide range of emissions profiles. A mixed-use new urbanist development produced 22% fewer emissions than an adjacent development of large single-family homes, both of which were in a transit-poor area on the far edge of a suburban city. A high-density neighbourhood adjacent to a suburban city centre, and one adjacent to a central city centre, produced 50% and 67% fewer emissions than the neighbourhood of large single-family homes. Findings suggest that, while compactness may be most effective when it is coupled with high frequency transit, decoupling the pair and building compactness before or without transit can still yield considerable household emissions reductions.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "5740278a9c2995bb5346e8ec5d4e15ecb381af69", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1535758277", "DOI": "10.4324/9781849774741", "CorpusId": 108986502}, "title": "Doing Business in a New Climate: A Guide to Measuring, Reducing and Offsetting Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "abstract": "Introduction Climate Change Impacts on the Economy Part I: Getting Started: Planning for the Success of the GHG Management Program Define the Business Case Establish Goals Obtain Buy-In and Commitment Create a Climate Leadership Team and Allocate Funds Helpful Resources Part II: Measuring Greenhouse Gas Emissions Why Carry Out an Emissions Inventory?

The transformation of conventional gasoline vehicles to new energy vehicles is an important initiative to realize the goal of developing low-carbon city through energy saving and emissions reduction, while electric vehicles (EV) will play an important role in this transition due to their advantage in energy saving and lower carbon emissions. After reviewing the existing researches on energy saving and emissions reduction of electric vehicles, this paper analyzed the factors affecting carbon emissions reduction. Combining with electric vehicles promotion program in Beijing, the paper analyzed carbon emissions and reduction potential of electric vehicles in six scenarios using the optimized energy consumption related carbon emissions model from the perspective of fuel life cycle. The scenarios included power energy structure, fuel type (energy consumption per 100 km), car type (CO2 emission factor of fuel), urban traffic conditions (speed), coal-power technologies and battery type (weight, energy efficiency). The results showed that the optimized model was able to estimate carbon emissions caused by fuel consumption more reasonably; electric vehicles had an obvious restrictive carbon reduction potential with the fluctuation of 57%-81.2% in the analysis of six influencing factors, while power energy structure and coal-power technologies play decisive roles in life-cycle carbon emissions of electric vehicles with the reduction potential of 78.1% and 81.2%, respectively. Finally, some optimized measures were proposed to reduce transport energy consumption and carbon emissions during electric vehicles promotion including improving energy structure and coal technology, popularizing energy saving technologies and electric vehicles, accelerating the battery R&D and so on.

The model reproduces the wintertime maximum in surface ammonium nitrate concentrations in the Central Valley (regional mean concentrations are three times higher in December than in June), associated with lower planetary boundary layer heights and colder temperatures, and the wintertime minimum in the LA region (regional mean concentrations are two times higher in June than December) associated with ammonia limitation. Year round, we attribute at least 50% of the inorganic PM2.5 mass simulated throughout California to anthropogenic ammonia emissions.", "year": 2014}]}
