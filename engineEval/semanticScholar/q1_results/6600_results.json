This work reviews the existing methodologies for source apportionment and sensitivity analysis to identify key differences and stress their implicit limitations. The emphasis is laid on the differences between source impacts (sensitivity analysis) and contributions (source apportionment) obtained by using four different methodologies: brute-force top-down, brute-force bottom-up, tagged species and decoupled direct method (DDM). A simple theoretical example to compare these approaches is used highlighting differences and potential implications for policy. When the relationships between concentration and emissions are linear, impacts and contributions are equivalent concepts. In this case, source apportionment and sensitivity analysis may be used indifferently for both air quality planning purposes and quantifying source contributions. However, this study demonstrates that when the relationship between emissions and concentrations is nonlinear, sensitivity approaches are not suitable to retrieve source contributions and source apportionment methods are not appropriate to evaluate the impact of abatement strategies. A quantification of the potential nonlinearities should therefore be the first step prior to source apportionment or planning applications, to prevent any limitations in their use. When nonlinearity is mild, these limitations may, however, be acceptable in the context of the other uncertainties inherent to complex models. Moreover, when using sensitivity analysis for planning, it is important to note that, under nonlinear circumstances, the calculated impacts will only provide information for the exact conditions (e.g.\u00a0emission reduction share) that are simulated.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "d4200a201b4293b943066e1b5142586261eeb7d3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3004697769", "DOI": "10.5194/BG-17-2987-2020", "CorpusId": 226196696}, "title": "Is there warming in the pipeline? A multi-model analysis of the Zero Emissions Commitment from CO2", "abstract": "Abstract. The Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC) is the change in global mean temperature expected to occur following the cessation of net CO2 emissions and as such is a critical parameter for calculating the remaining carbon budget. The Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP) was established to gain a better understanding of the potential magnitude and sign of ZEC, in addition to the processes that underlie this metric. A total of 18 Earth system models of both full and intermediate complexity participated in ZECMIP. All models conducted an experiment where atmospheric CO2 concentration increases exponentially until 1000\u2009PgC has been emitted. Thereafter emissions are set to zero and models are configured to allow free evolution of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Many models conducted additional second-priority simulations with different cumulative emission totals and an alternative idealized emissions pathway with a gradual transition to zero emissions. The inter-model range of ZEC 50\u00a0years after emissions cease for the 1000\u2009PgC experiment is \u22120.36 to 0.29\u2009\u2218C, with a model ensemble mean of \u22120.07\u2009\u2218C, median of \u22120.05\u2009\u2218C, and standard deviation of 0.19\u2009\u2218C. Models exhibit a wide variety of behaviours after emissions cease, with some models continuing to warm for decades to millennia and others cooling substantially. Analysis shows that both the carbon uptake by the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere are important for counteracting the warming effect from the reduction in ocean heat uptake in the decades after emissions cease. This warming effect is difficult to constrain due to high uncertainty in the efficacy of ocean heat uptake. Overall, the most likely value of ZEC on multi-decadal timescales is close to zero, consistent with previous model experiments and simple theory.\n", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "1007d7787668ec05d4ed97b7556aee0e751019eb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2610407610", "CorpusId": 134485324}, "title": "Third National Communication on Climate Change", "abstract": "The implementation of the Communication will contribute in the reduction of GHG emissions on the National level and adaptation of the most vunerable sectors to climate change, as well as for reduction of pollution in the environmental medias and areas.

Today, post-treatment catalytic technologies are necessary to meet the current most strict or the forthcoming emission limits. In traditional gasoline-fueled stoichiometric engines, threeway catalysts are used for the abatement of NOx, unburned hydrocarbons, and CO. However, the need to reduce fuel consumption and the corresponding CO2 emissions has led in the past to an impressive spread in the market of lean-burn engines, such as diesel or direct-injection (DI) gasoline engines. These engines operate in the presence of excess oxygen, in which the current three-way catalysts, optimized for exhausts that fluctuate around oxygen-free conditions, do not ensure acceptable emission levels of NOx. The NH3 selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and the NOx storage\u2013reduction (NSR) or lean NOx trap systems are at present the top contenders for reducing NOx concentration in the exhaust from diesel and lean-burn gasoline direct-injection vehicles. Although the NH3-SCR technology, which accomplishes NOx reduction by injecting urea (a precursor of NH3) in the exhaust gases and requires an onboard urea tank, is preferred for heavy-duty vehicles and minivans, lean NOx traps have been specifically developed for small engines. This technology is based on the use of a suitable catalytic material that consists of an alumina carrier on which alkaliand/or alkali-earth metal compounds (e.g. , K and Ba) and noble metals (e.g. , Pt) are deposited. These catalysts operate under cyclic conditions, which alternate long periods in the presence of excess oxygen during which NOx species are stored on the alkaliand/or alkali-earth metal compounds with short rich phases during which the adsorbed NOx species are reduced to nitrogen on Pt. [2] Although the NSR technology is presently being used on a commercial scale, an agreement and understanding of the mechanistic aspects of the storage of NOx species and of their reduction is still lacking. Regarding the storage phase, many authors suggest that NO is at first oxidized by Pt to NO2, which is then stored onto the alkalior alkali-earth metal compound (e.g. , BaO) in the form of nitrates according to the overall reactions in Equations (1) and (2):", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a07d75f8211353b214bb7f52d4f3cabd309f0ef4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2122847530", "DOI": "10.5547/2160-5890.1.1.5", "CorpusId": 17020646}, "title": "The Influence of Shale Gas on U.S. Energy and Environmental Policy", "abstract": "The emergence of U.S. shale gas resources to economic viability affects the nation's energy outlook and the expected role of natural gas in climate policy.

Phenylpropanoid volatiles are the main determinants of floral scent in petunia (Petunia hybrida).

Road vehicles emitted more than 70% of NOx and VOC of all mobile sources, and more than 60% of PM2.5. \n \nFrom 2005 to 2010, implementation of EU legislation has reduced NOx from mobile sources by 18%, PM by 21% and VOC by 34%. For NOx, the decline is lower than the corresponding reductions from stationary sources (.26%), so that the relative importance of the transport sector has increased despite the EURO legislation. Especially for NOx, the recent drop in emissions is less than what was anticipated by the 2005 Thematic Strategy on Air Pollution. The major reason for this shortfall are problems in the implementation of NOx limit values for light duty diesel vehicles, where changes in real-life emissions did not follow the improvements in the type approval limit values. As a consequence, by 2015 NOx emissions from light duty diesel vehicles will be a factor two higher compared to a situation where real-life emissions of the EURO 2 to EURO 5 standards would have followed the trends in the type approval limit values. \n \nIt is estimated that successful implementation of the EURO 6 standards for diesel vehicles (assuming 50% higher real-life emissions than the type approval value to allow for degradation over time and uncertainties in the driving cycles) should lead to a rapid drop of NOx emissions in the next few years. Up to 2020, NOx emissions from road transport would decline by 65% compared to 2005, by 80% in 2025, and by 87% in 2030. \n \nPM emissions from road transport would fall by 62% in 2020 and by 70% in 2030, and VOC by up to 80% until 2030. For PM, the majority of emissions will be caused by non-exhaust sources (tyre and brake wear, road abrasion). \n \nFor non-road mobile machinery, implementation of the agreed emission controls according along the current schedule should cut NOx emissions in 2020 by 40% and in 2030 by 60% compared to 2005. Emissions from PM2.5 are projected to drop by 55% in 2020 and by 70% in 2030; the reduction for VOC emissions is estimated at 50% by 2020 and 60% until 2030. Least changes are expected from ships due to their long lifetime and the slow penetration of new technology. \n \nIf these changes materialize, emissions from mobile sources would decline faster than those of stationary sources. Especially road transport would lower its share in total emissions, e.g., for NOx from 44% in 2005 to 17% in 2030, for PM from 14% to 7% and for VOC from 23% to 9%. \n \nThere is a potential for further emission reductions also for non-road mobile machinery, where the introduction of Stage V controls (equivalent to the EURO VI level for NOx and the EURO V for PM emissions from heavy duty vehicles) in 2020 could cut NOx emissions from NRMM by 15% in 2030 and PM2.5 emissions by 26%. For further reductions ships and aircraft would need to contribute more. \n \nFor road vehicles, the introduction of hypothetical EURO 7/VII standards after 2020, with real-world emission factors around 20% below the EURO 6/VI limit values could reduce NOx emissions from road vehicles by 13% below the baseline projection for 2030. \n \nAs a big caveat, emission projections for road transport are particularly sensitive against assumptions on the effectiveness and timing of new legislation, especially for NOx from light duty diesel vehicles. For instance, if real-life emissions comply with the EURO 6 type approval values only by 2018 instead of 2015, NOx emissions from diesel light duty vehicles would be 40% higher in 2020. If the type approval limit values were fully achieved in real-life driving cycles, NOx emissions from this source would be 40% lower after 2030. If however, real-world emissions of EURO 6 vehicles would only follow the reduction rate in type approval values relative to real-life EURO 5 emissions, NOx emissions might be by 270 kt and 470 kt above the baseline in 2020 and 2030, respectively, and total NOx emissions would increase by 5% and 13%, respectively. \n \nFor PM, non-exhaust emissions (road abrasion, brake and tyre wear) will become the major source in the future, and total mass of PM emissions will critically depend on the development of these sources. \n \nImplications of these further measures on air quality at urban hot spots will be reported in Part 2 of this report at a later stage.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "c87f1410606225965c23de2d166106b2ee46479d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1965312989", "DOI": "10.4271/2013-01-0917", "CorpusId": 54012647}, "title": "Post Injections for Soot Reduction in Diesel Engines: A Review of Current Understanding", "abstract": "This work is a technical review of past research and a synthesis of current understanding of post injections for soot reduction in diesel engines. A post injection, which is a short injection after a longer main injection, is an in-cylinder tool to reduce engine-out soot to meet pollutant emissions standards while maintaining efficiency, and potentially to reduce or eliminate exhaust aftertreatment. A sprawling literature on post injections documents the effects of post injections on engine-out soot with variations in many engine operational parameters. Explanations of how post injections lead to engineout soot reduction vary and are sometimes inconsistent or contradictory, in part because supporting fundamental experimental or modeling data are often not available. In this paper, we review the available data describing the efficacy of post-injections and highlight several candidate in-cylinder mechanisms that may control their efficacy. We first discuss three in-cylinder mechanisms that have been frequently proposed to explain how post injections reduce engine-out soot. Thereafter, to provide a foundation for interpretation of past research, we briefly review basic soot formation and oxidation chemistry, and soot/fluid processes in fuel sprays and engine flows. Next, we provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on the efficacy of post-injections for soot reduction as a function of engine operational parameters including injection duration and dwell, exhaust-gas recirculation, load, boost, speed, swirl, and spray targeting. We conclude by identifying major remaining research questions that need to be addressed to help achieve a design-level understanding of the mechanisms of soot reduction by post injections.

Reliable in vivo biomarkers to monitor disease severity and reflect the underlying dopaminergic degeneration are important for future disease-modifying therapy in Parkinson disease.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo use [18F]9-fluoropropyl-(+)-dihydrotetrabenazine (18F-DTBZ; [18F]AV-133) positron emission tomography (PET) to explore the characteristics of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 imaging in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) with different severity levels as well as to investigate its capability in monitoring clinical severity.\n\n\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS\nRegional uptakes for 18F-DTBZ PET of different disease stages were measured. Seventeen healthy control participants and 53 patients in 3 groups of mild, moderate, and advanced stages of PD were recruited for 18F-DTBZ PET scans from the Movement Disorders Clinic in the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nThe severity of disease in patients with PD was quantified by modified Hoehn-Yahr Scale, Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale total scores and subscores of posture instability and gait disturbance, tremor, akinesia, and rigidity while not taking medication. Both voxelwise- and volume of interest-based image analyses were performed. The specific uptake ratio (SUR) of each volume of interest and voxel was calculated as (target uptake\u2009-\u2009reference uptake)\u2009/\u2009reference uptake using the occipital reference region from magnetic resonance imaging-based spatially normalized 18F-DTBZ images for each participant. Average SUR images were displayed as 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional to illustrate the image patterns in each group. The nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test on regional SUR was used for group comparison between healthy control participants and patients with PD at different stages. Quantitative parameters were correlated with severity of disease and disease duration by Spearman correlation. Voxelwise analysis for evaluating dopaminergic neuron decline of different PD stages was performed by SPM5.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional 18F-DTBZ PET images demonstrated that the reduction of vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 availability was obviously correlated with the severity of disease in patients with PD.

We use results from tracer-gas experiments in California's South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) to quantify students' iF(SP) and iF1SP for school bus emissions. Six buses were studied during nine runs with windows open and seven runs with windows closed. Reported iF(SP) values (units: per million; min = 10, max = 94, mean = 27) indicate that the total mass of a bus' exhaust inhaled by students commuting on it is comparable in magnitude to the total mass of that bus' exhaust inhaled by all other people in the SoCAB. Reported iF1SP values (units: per million; min = 0.2, max = 2.4, mean = 0.7) indicate that average per capita inhalation of emissions from any single bus is 10(5)-10(6) times greater for a student on that school bus than for a typical resident in the SoCAB. Vehicle self-pollution rate varies with bus window position (open or closed) and bus manufacture year. Our results can be used to develop cost-effective strategies to reduce children's exposure to school bus emissions. Our results indicate, for example, that even if emission reductions were many times more expensive per gram emitted for school buses than for an average vehicle, it would still be less expensive per gram inhaled by a student to reduce emissions from school buses than from an average vehicle.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "92216c3205cc3fe1ea2a5012d31d9f3cce44779f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2891000556", "DOI": "10.1007/s11356-018-3051-6", "CorpusId": 52186133, "PubMed": "30203346"}, "title": "Modelling the relationship between poverty, environment, and institutions: a panel data study", "abstract": "The paper examines the relationship between poverty and CO2 emission.

Existing evaluations of behavioural change have focused primarily on direct energy reductions, typically in households and buildings. However, changes in consumer demand have deeper impacts via their upstream supply chains. The consumer behaviour options considered in the portfolio focus on green household initiatives. Combining existing micro-level studies with a multiregional input-output economic model, we estimated the potential efficacy and uptake of each behaviour across the European Union (EU). The results suggest that adopting these consumer options could reduce carbon footprints by approximately 25%.

Little consideration has been given to the potential adverse carbon consequences associated with the technology transition. This paper considers the embodied emissions that will occur to replace the UK\u2019s fossil fuel-reliant energy supply with low carbon sources. The analysis generates a number of representative scenarios where emissions embodied in energy systems are integrated within current national climate and energy policy objectives. The embodied emissions associated with a new low carbon energy system are lower than the emissions reduction associated with the low carbon energy sources, confirming that there is a carbon return on investment. However, even if the UK reaches its 2050 territorial climate target, it is estimated that by 2050 an additional 200 Mt CO2 emissions are generated overseas (compared to 128 Mt generated within the UK) in the production of imported fuels and infrastructure components. The cost-optimal model results suggest that more electrification would need to occur, supported by nuclear energy, mainly in replacement of natural gas to mitigate these emissions. However, due to a number of deployment barriers, other policy interventions along the energy supply chain are likely needed, which are discussed alongside the model results.

We have calculated the changes in stratospheric ozone in response to changes in the halogen loading over the past decades, using a two- dimensional (latitude/height) model constrained by source gas mixing ratios at the surface. Model calculations of the decrease of total column ozone since 1980 agree reason- ably well with observed ozone trends, in particular when the contribution from very short-lived bromine compounds is included. Model calculations with bromine source gas mixing ratios fixed at 1959 levels, corresponding approxi- mately to a situation with no anthropogenic bromine emis- sions, show an ozone column reduction between 1980 and 2005 at Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes of only 55% compared to a model run including all halogen source gases. In this sense anthropogenic bromine emissions are responsi- ble for 45% of the model estimated column ozone loss at Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes. However, since a large fraction of the bromine induced ozone loss is due to the com- bined BrO/ClO catalytic cycle, the effect of bromine would have been smaller in the absence of anthropogenic chlorine emissions. The chemical efficiency of bromine relative to chlorine for global total ozone depletion from our model cal- culations, expressed by the so called -factor, is 64 on an an- nual average. This value is much higher than previously pub- lished results. Updates in reaction rate constants can explain only part of the differences in .

In total, 19 macro level sustainability indicators are quantified for a scenario in which electric vehicles are charged through the existing U.S. power grid with no additional infrastructure, and an extreme scenario in which electric vehicles are fully charged with solar charging stations. The analysis covers all life cycle phases from the material extraction, processing, manufacturing, and operation phases to the end-of-life phases of vehicles and batteries. Results of this analysis revealed that the manufacturing phase is the most influential phase in terms of socio-economic impacts compared to other life cycle phases, whereas operation phase is the most dominant phase in the terms of environmental impacts and some of the socio-economic impacts such as human health and economic cost of emissions. Electric vehicles have less air pollution cost and human health impacts compared to conventional gasoline vehicles. The economic cost of emissions and human health impact reduction potential can be up to 45% and 35%, respectively, if electric vehicles are charged through solar charging stations.

Despite having a similar reduction potential of 43-44% in 2100, the two types of policy instruments result in opposite outcomes for food prices. Incentive-based mitigation, such as protecting carbon-rich forests or adopting low-emission production techniques, increase land scarcity and production costs and thereby food prices. Preference-based mitigation, such as reduced household waste or lower consumption of animal-based products, decreases land scarcity, prevents emissions leakage, and concentrates production on the most productive sites and consequently lowers food prices. Whereas agricultural emissions are further abated in the combination of these mitigation measures, the synergy of strategies fails to substantially lower food prices.

Results demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of contralateral noise on OAE amplitude was absent from the cochlea with severed efferent fibers. These findings appear to be independent of acoustic reflex activity, as suppression was absent despite normal reflexes. Inter-aural suppression of emissions recorded from the patients' intact cochleae act as a control and show a clear reduction in amplitude during contralateral stimulation in a frequency specific pattern consistent with normal findings. Patients who had undergone a similar surgical approach for vascular decompression of the VIIIth nerve without vestibular nerve section, were studied in order to assess the impact of retrolabyrinthine surgery on inter-aural suppression. Inhibition of OAE amplitude was maintained in all control cases in both the operated and intact sides, and was consistent with suppression observed in normal subjects, suggesting that the surgical procedures had not disturbed inter-aural suppression of otoacoustic emissions. It is concluded that the olivocochlear efferent system, when activated by low level contralateral acoustic stimulation, has an inhibitory role in controlling the cellular mechanisms responsible for the generation of otoacoustic emissions in humans.

It remains unsolved how to intensify the Bi absorption and emission intensity for low Bi content materials and stabilize Bi active centers as the key to realizing the applications of Bi fibers and fiber lasers. Moreover, due to the co-existence of multiple Bi centers, the behavior of Bi near-infrared (NIR) centers remains unclear. Here, taking silicate glasses as a model glass system, we demonstrate the formation of Bi NIR centers and the intense enhancement of Bi NIR emission by the topo-chemical reduction of the Bi ions and the tailoring of the glass structure. By constructing a local reduction environment through the introduction of a nitride, dramatic changes, including highly intensified absorption and comparable emission intensity (\u223c1200 times), were achieved in low Bi content glass. We also observed excellent anti-thermal quenching behavior in this glass, which may be due to the strengthened glass structure resulting from the partial substitution of oxygen by nitrogen in the glass network. Furthermore, the same scenario can be reproduced in other typical glass systems.

Uncertainties associated with input datasets (activity data and emissions factors) were used to combine the datasets, where most certain datasets contribute the most. This method utilizes all the input data, while minimizing the uncertainty of the emissions estimate. The uncertainty of input datasets was influenced by the quality of the data, the sample size (for sample-based datasets), and the extent to which the timeframe of the data matches the period of interest. Area of deforestation, and the agriculture-driver factor (extent to which agriculture drives deforestation), were the most uncertain components of the emissions estimates, thus improvement in the uncertainties related to these estimates will provide the greatest reductions in uncertainties of emissions estimates. Over the period of the study, Latin America had the highest proportion of deforestation driven by agriculture (78%), and Africa had the lowest (62%). Latin America had the highest emissions from agriculture-driven deforestation, and these peaked at 974 +/- 148 Mt CO2 yr(-1) in 2000-2005. Africa saw a continuous increase in emissions between 1990 and 2015 (from 154 +/- 21-412 +/- 75 Mt CO2 yr(-1)), so mitigation initiatives could be prioritized there.

This methodology combines a detailed fluid mechanics code with a detailed chemical kinetics code. Instead of directly linking the two codes, which would require an extremely long computational time, the methodology consists of first running the fluid mechanics code to obtain temperature profiles as a function of time. These temperature profiles are then used as input to a multi-zone chemical kinetics code. The advantage of this procedure is that a small number of zones (10) is enough to obtain accurate results. This procedure achieves the benefits of linking the fluid mechanics and the chemical kinetics codes with a great reduction in the computational effort, to a level that can be handled with current computers. The success of this procedure is in large part a consequence of the fact that for much of the compression stroke the chemistry is inactive and thus has little influence on fluid mechanics and heat transfer. Then, when chemistry is active, combustion is rather sudden, leaving little time for interaction between chemistry and fluid mixing and heat transfer.

The present study quantifies the airborne particulate matter (PM2.5) co-benefits of AB 32 by comparing future air quality under a Business as Usual (BAU) scenario (without AB 32) to AB 32 implementation by sector. AB 32 measures were divided into five levels defined by sector as follows: 1) industrial sources, 2) electric utility and natural gas sources, 3) agricultural sources, 4) on-road mobile sources and 5) other mobile sources. Air quality throughout California was simulated using the UCD source-oriented air quality model during 12\u00a0days of severe air pollution and over 108\u00a0days of typical meteorology representing an annual average period in the year 2030 (10\u00a0years after the AB 32 adoption deadline). The net effect of all AB 32 measures reduced statewide primary PM and NOx emissions by ~1\u00a0% and ~15\u00a0%, respectively. Air quality simulations predict that these emissions reductions lower population-weighted PM2.5 concentrations by ~6\u00a0% for California.

With decreasing L2, the L1-L2 primary tone level difference was continuously increased according to L1 = 0.4L2 + 39 dB, to account for differences of the primary tone responses at the f2 place. Above 1.5 kHz, DPs were measurable with that paradigm on average within 10 dB of the average hearing threshold in both subject groups. The growth of the DP was compressive in normal hearing subjects, with strong saturation at moderate primary tone levels. In cases of cochlear impairment, reductions of the DP level were greatest at lowest, but smallest at highest stimulus levels, such that the growth of the DP became linearized. The correlation of the DP level to the hearing threshold was found to depend on the stimulus level. Maximal correlations were found in impaired ears at moderate primary tone levels around L2 = 45 dB SPL, but at lowest stimulus levels in normal hearing (L2 = 25 dB SPL).

Using positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), we determined whether changes in tumor FDG uptake predict histopathologic treatment responses in high-grade STS after the initial cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Experimental Design: From February 2006 to March 2008, 50 patients with resectable high-grade STS scheduled for neoadjuvant therapy and subsequent tumor resection were enrolled prospectively. FDG-PET/CT before (baseline), after the first cycle (early follow-up), and after completion of neoadjuvant therapy (late follow-up) was done. Tumor FDG uptake and changes were measured by standardized uptake values. Histopathologic examination of the resected specimen provided an assessment of treatment response. Patients with \u226595% pathologic necrosis were classified as treatment responders. FDG-PET/CT results were compared with histopathologic findings. Results: At early follow-up, FDG uptake decreased significantly more in 8 (16%) responders than in the 42 (84%) nonresponders (\u221255% versus \u221223%; P = 0.002). All responders and 14 of 42 nonresponders had a \u226535% reduction in standardized uptake value between baseline and early follow-up. Using a \u226535% reduction in FDG uptake as early metabolic response threshold resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of FDG-PET for histopathologic response of 100% and 67%, respectively. Applying a higher threshold at late follow-up improved specificity but not sensitivity. CT had no value at response prediction. Conclusion: A 35% reduction in tumor FDG uptake at early follow-up is a sensitive predictor of histopathologic tumor response.

The motivations for material efficiency include reducing energy demand, reducing the emissions and other environmental impacts of industry, and increasing national resource security. There are many technical strategies that might bring it about, and these could mainly be implemented today if preferred by customers or producers. However, current economic structures favour the substitution of material for labour, and consumer preferences for material consumption appear to continue even beyond the point at which increased consumption provides any increase in well-being. Therefore, policy will be required to stimulate material efficiency.

While the technology of nanolasers is steadily being deployed, their expected performance for on-chip optical interconnects is still largely unknown due to a limited understanding of some of their key features. Specifically, as the cavity size is reduced with respect to the emission wavelength, the stimulated and the spontaneous emission rates are modified, which is known as the Purcell effect in the context of cavity quantum electrodynamics. This effect is expected to have a major impact in the \u201cthreshold-less\u201d behavior of nanolasers and in their modulation speed; but its role is poorly understood in practical laser structures, characterized by significant homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening and by a complex spatial distribution of the active material and cavity field. In this paper, we investigate the role of the Purcell effect in the stimulated and spontaneous emission rates of semiconductor lasers taking into account the carriers\u2019 spatial distribution in the volume of the active region over a wide range of cavity dimensions and emitter/cavity linewidths, enabling the detailed modeling of the static and dynamic characteristics of either micro- or nano-scale lasers using single-mode rate-equations analysis.

Globalization related dietary changes are contributing to the epidemic of non-communicable diseases and to the global climate crisis, and are associated with huge carbon and water footprints. The objective of the study is to assess inequalities in health impacts and in attributable greenhouse gases-GHG emissions in Italy by hypothesizing different scenarios of reduction in red and processed meat consumption towards healthier consumption patterns more compliant with the recommendations of the Mediterranean food pyramid. Methods We used demographic and food consumption patterns from national surveys and risk relationships between meat intake and cardiovascular and colorectal cancer mortality from IARC and other meta-analyses. From the baseline data (year 2005\u20132006, average 406 gr/week beef and 245 gr/week processed meat), we considered hypothetical meat reduction scenarios according to international dietary guidelines such as the Mediterranean pyramid targets. For each geographical area (Northwest, Northeast, Centre, and South) and gender, we calculated the number of avoidable deaths from colorectal cancer, and cardiovascular disease among the adult population. Moreover, years of life gained by the adult population from 2012 to 2030 and changes in life expectancy of the 2012 birth cohort were quantified using gender-specific life tables. GHG emission reductions under Mediterranean scenario were estimated only for beef by applying the Global Warming Potential (GWP) coefficient to total consumption and to a low carbon food substitution in adult diet. Results The deaths avoidable (as percentage change compared to baseline) according to the three reduction scenarios for beef consumption were between 2.3% and 4.5% for colorectal cancer, and between 2.1% and 4.0% for cardiovascular disease; higher benefits would be observed in Northwestern areas and among males. In parallel, 5% and 6.4% of colorectal cancer and CVD deaths would be avoided if the Italian population ate the advised quantity of processed meat. Life table analysis suggests that the scenario that is fully compliant with the Mediterranean diet model would save 5 million years of life lost prematurely among men and women over the next 18 years and would increase average life expectancy of future generations by over 7 months. Considering the environmental impact, emissions associated with the actual total intake of beef range from 12,900 to 21,800 Gg CO2 eq; emissions saved according to the Mediterranean scenario are in the range 8000\u201314000 Gg CO2 eq per year. The per capita reduction is 263 KgCO2eq/year/person with higher reductions in Northwestern and Central areas. Conclusions In Italy, scenarios for reducing beef consumption are consistent with significant health and environmental co-benefits on current and future generations. Results support introducing policies to promote healthier behavior towards red and processed meat in the adult population within an overall balanced and healthy dietary pattern.

To examine how structural properties may modulate the toxicity of CNT, one preparation of multiwall CNT has been modified (i) by grinding (introducing structural defects) and subsequently heating either in a vacuum at 600 degrees C (causing reduction of oxygenated carbon functionalities and reduction of metallic oxides) or in an inert atmosphere at 2400 degrees C (causing elimination of metals and annealing of defects) and (ii) by heating at 2400 degrees C in an inert atmosphere and subsequently grinding the thermally treated CNT (introducing defects in a metal-deprived carbon framework). The presence of framework and surface defects, metals, and oxygenated functionalities was monitored by means of a set of techniques, including micro-Raman spectroscopy, adsorption calorimetry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, and atomic emission spectroscopy. Contrary to traditional toxicants, such as asbestos, CNT may quench rather than generate oxygenated free radicals. The potential of the modified CNT to scavenge hydroxyl radicals was thus evaluated by means of electron spin resonance spectroscopy (spin trapping). The original ground material exhibited a scavenging activity toward hydroxyl radicals, which was eliminated by heating at 2400 degrees C but restored upon grinding. This scavenging activity, related to the presence of defects, appears to go paired with the genotoxic and inflammatory potential of CNT reported in the companion paper.

The annual average PM10 concentration of Chinese cities is 5 times as high as the World Health Organization\u2019s guideline. The satellite observation indicates that the PM2.5 concentration in some regions could be as high as 90 \u03bcg/m3, which is 1 order of magnitude higher than that in most cities in the United States and Europe. Therefore, emissions of primary PM and the precursors of secondary PM, such as SO2 and NOX, have to be considerably reduced to improve air quality. Some study has indicated that a minimum of 10 million metric tons (MMT) reductions of SO2 and NOX emissions is needed in China to avoid air quality nonattainment. Most emissions of air pollutants in China are associated with coal consumption. In 2010 China contributed 48% of global coal consumption. Coal consumed in China, including those burned in the boilers and used in the kilns, accounted for more than 90%, 70%, and 60% of national-wide emissions of SO2, NOX, and primary PM10, respectively. There is no alternative for China except to significantly reduce emissions from coal consumption in order to improve air quality. End-of-pipe technologies have always been the top choice in China to abate emissions from boilers and kilns. For example, great efforts have been made to promote flue gas desulfurization (FGD) in order to hit the 10% reduction target of SO2 emissions over 2005\u22122010. The penetration rate of FGD in Chinese thermal power plants increased from 12% in 2005 to 82% in 2010. The significant growth of FGD resulted in a 29% reduction of SO2 emissions, from 13.5 MMT in 2005 to 9.6 MMT in 2010, despite a 50% increase of coal consumption in power sector. Since installation of FGD has shown great effectiveness in reducing SO2 emissions, some other end-ofpipe technologies, such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR), have been recognized as promising options to achieve 10% reduction of NOX emissions over 2010\u22122015. Despite the great success and prospects of the end-of-pipe technologies in emissions reduction, China is still facing critical challenges to address the emissions from coal consumption. The first one is the increasing coal consumption in the near future. China\u2019s annual coal consumption increased from 1.4 billion metric tons (BMT) in 2000 to 3.1 BMT in 2010. Another 1 BMT increment is expected in the next 5 years, if the energy intensive industries, such as cement, iron and steel making, maintain rapid growth. The second challenge lies in limited potential from the end-of-pipe technologies. Success of SO2 emissions control over 2005\u22122010 is attributed to rapid growth of FGD. However, there is only 10% of existing power units left for FGD installation. New approaches have to be applied to achieve further reductions. The third challenge comes from the small and dispersed emission sources. To date there are approximately 500 000 industrial boilers in China, consuming 0.6 BMT coal annually.

The MeOH analysis shows CCU to be an inferior mitigation option compared to a system with CCS producing the same fuel without CO2 utilization. CCU also is far more costly. The generalized analysis further reveals that the mitigation potential of CCU for fuels production is limited to 50% of the original emissions of the reference system without CCU.

These results were not significantly different from the difference between measurements of methane efflux using chambers enclosing clipped and unclipped plots (12.0-27.9 mmol m-2 day-'). 3 We determined that methane transport through S. palustris contributed between 64 and 90% of the net methane efflux from the peatland, while the other peatland without plants capable of rapid methane transport had significantly lower methane efflux. The higher annual efflux from peat with aerenchymatous plants appears to be due to several factors, including increased substrate production which enhances methane production, reduction in methane oxidation, as well as easier methane transport from the site of production. 4 Plants capable of transporting methane regulated the methane pool in the saturated zone by depleting both dissolved methane in the pore-waters and the concentration of methane in gas bubbles trapped in the saturated peat. 5 Our experiments indicate that methane transport through S. palustris is due to molecular diffusion, and is not influenced by pressurization or stomatal aperture.", "year": 1996}, {"paperId": "5d7c72fcb6cc0d7bd760fa02daaca26fb093c675", "externalIds": {"MAG": "152085413", "CorpusId": 127440781}, "title": "Impact des emissions europeennes sur le bilan de l'ozone tropospherique a l'interface de l'europe et de l'atlantique nord : apport de la modelisation lagrangienne et des mesures en altitude", "abstract": "La these presentee dans ce manuscrit a pour objectif d'apporter une contribution a l'etude de l'impact des emissions europeennes sur la chimie de l'ozone tropospherique a l'interface de l'europe et de l'atlantique nord.

This sensor provides crank angle resolved information about the in-cylinder soot evolution The experiments confirm conclusions of earlier works that soot reduction due to a post injection is mainly based on two reasons: increased turbulence (from the post injection) during soot oxidation and lower soot formation due to lower amount of fuel in the main combustion at similar load conditions. A third effect of heat addition during the soot oxidation, which was often mentioned in the literature, could not be confirmed. In addition, the experiments show that variations of turbulence (from swirl) and reaction kinetics have a minor influence on the diffusion controlled heat release rate. However, the time phasing of the soot evolution is highly influenced by these variations with only small changes in the peak soot concentration. It is shown that the soot reduction of a post injection depends on the timing. More precisely, the soot reduction capability of a post injection decreases rapidly as soon as its timing is late in the soot oxidation phase. The soot oxidation rate can only be improved by increased turbulence and heat addition from the post injection in a time window before the in-cylinder soot peak occurs. Depending on EGR and swirl level, a maximum dwell time can be defined after which the post injection effect becomes counterproductive with respect to the soot oxidation rate.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "dc5a3470f90363c098d63f53c1c84fa8ee7b1ad9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "282849673", "CorpusId": 92252104}, "title": "Emissions and Reduction Potentials of Hydrofluorocarbons, Perfluorocarbons and Sulphur Hexafluoride in Germany", "abstract": "The greenhouse gases subject to emission reduction commitments under the UN Climate Convention include the fluorinated compounds sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The present study projects the emissions of these gases in Germany over the 1995-2010 period, with and without additional emission abatement efforts. In the business-as-usual scenario, total emissions of the three fluorinated gases rise over the 1995-2010 period from 11.1 to 27.4 million tonnes CO2 equivalent. This rise is 72% attributable to HFCs, used above all for refrigeration and stationary air-conditioning, for mobile air-conditioning, for blowing extruded polystyrene (XPS) foam and for one-component polyurethane (PU) foam. Soundproof glazing is the largest SF6 emissions sector. Most PFC emissions come from semiconductor manufacturing and aluminium smelting. The reduction scenario, too, does not achieve stabilization of fluorinated gas emissions. The rate of growth is only slowed, with 11.1 million tonnes CO2 equivalent in 1995 growing to 14.9 million in 2010. The measures proposed to attenuate emissions growth are: mandatory equipment maintenance in refrigeration and stationary air-conditioning, refrigerant substitution of HFCs by CO2 in mobile air-conditioning, partial HFC substitution by CO2 and ethanol in XPS foam blowing, 95% HFC substitution by flammable hydrocarbons in one-component PU foam. Complete SF6 phase-out is considered to be feasible in soundproof glazing. The PFC emissions of the semiconductor industry can be cut by 85% by new chamber cleaning technologies.

This was done by using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) modelling approach with data from trials using both standard soya-based broiler diets and reduced-protein diets with added protease.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe results for the feed production chain showed that there was a reduction in all environmental impact categories when protease was used in the diets. The biggest reduction occurred in the category of Global Warming Potential, mainly as a result of decreased carbon dioxide emissions from land use changes related to soya production. In the results for the broiler production chain, there were relatively bigger reductions in Eutrophication Potential and especially in Acidification Potential, mainly as a result of reduced feed protein content and subsequent nitrogen emissions from housing and manure management.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe use of protease in the broiler diets reduced the environmental impacts of both feed production and broiler production. The latter is mainly through reduced ammonia emissions, which has substantial benefit per se in the poultry industry.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "0f111aa36d00d42932ecf2dedf6f767102231fae", "externalIds": {"MAG": "848966364", "CorpusId": 106493275}, "title": "Pathways to Low Carbon Shipping - Abatement Potential Towards 2030", "abstract": "DNV has carried out a study of 59 ship segments representing the major ship types and sizes of international shipping, identifying 25 different measures that can contribute to reduced emissions.

When this layer is wet it masks changes in the underlying soil, making the canopy appear warm in the case of passive sensors (radiometer) and decreasing backscatter in the active case (scatterometer). A model for a grass canopy with thatch is presented in order to explain this behavior and for comparison with observations. The canopy model consists of three layers: grass, thatch, and the underlying soil. The grass blades are modeled by elongated elliptical discs and the thatch is modeled as a collection of disk shaped water droplets (i.e., the dry matter is neglected). The ground is homogeneous and flat. The distorted Born approximation is used to compute the radar cross section of this three layer canopy and the emissivity is computed from the radar cross section using the Peake formulation for the passive problem. Results are computed at L-band (1.4 GHz) and C-band (4.75 GHz) using canopy parameters (i.e., plant geometry, soil moisture, plant moisture, etc.) representative of Konza Prairie grasslands. The results are compared to C-band scatterometer measurements and L-band radiometer measurements at these grasslands. >", "year": 1994}, {"paperId": "181fb4f1c67e3d632dc0169f4bc93c03c28effe9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2108677433", "DOI": "10.1016/J.RSER.2013.05.070", "CorpusId": 21927369}, "title": "Review on alcohol fumigation on diesel engine: A viable alternative dual fuel technology for satisfactory engine performance and reduction of environment concerning emission", "abstract": null, "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "2d837e48c4bc1c80d3ef176cbaa895629bfffb9c", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "5102667", "MAG": "2462342061", "DOI": "10.1002/advs.201600182", "CorpusId": 8596415, "PubMed": "27980993"}, "title": "All\u2010Copper Nanocluster Based Down\u2010Conversion White Light\u2010Emitting Devices", "abstract": "Most of the present\u2010day down\u2010conversion white light\u2010emitting devices (WLEDs) utilize rare\u2010earth elements, which are expensive and facing the problem of shortage in supply.

Four types of second-generation feedstocks are considered: wheat straw, forest residue, poplar, and miscanthus. Seven out of 11 environmental impacts from ethanol are negative, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, when the system is credited for the co-products, indicating environmental savings. Ethanol from poplar is the best and straw the worst option for most impacts. Land use change from forest to miscanthus increases the GHG emissions several-fold. For poplar, the effect is opposite: converting grassland to forest reduces the emissions by three-fold. Compared to fossil and first-generation ethanol, ethanol from integrated biorefineries is more sustainable for most impacts, with the exception of wheat straw. Pure ethanol saves up to 87% of GHG emissions compared to petrol per MJ of fuel. However, for the current 5% ethanol\u2013petrol blends, the savings are much smaller (<3%). Therefore, unless much higher blends become widespread, the contribution of ethanol from integrated biorefineries to the reduction of GHG emissions will be insignificant. Yet, higher ethanol blends would lead to an increase in some impacts, notably terrestrial and freshwater toxicity as well as eutrophication for some feedstocks.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "eb272449ce709f810f907c6509d7ec03ffae46b6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2095583936", "DOI": "10.1364/OE.16.008003", "CorpusId": 45758472, "PubMed": "18545510"}, "title": "Design of high-contrast OLEDs with microcavity effect.", "abstract": "There is a large demand for Organic Light-Emitting Displays (OLEDs) with higher contrast, particularly for outdoor applications.
