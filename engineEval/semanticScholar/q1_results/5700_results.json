In tobacco-dependent individuals, smoking denicotinized cigarettes leads to reduced craving, but less pleasure, than smoking regular cigarettes. Using denicotinized cigarettes and 11C-raclopride positron emission tomography (PET) scanning, we sought to determine if nicotine is necessary for smoking-induced DA release. Sixty-two tobacco-dependent smokers underwent 11C-raclopride PET scanning, during which they smoked either a regular or denicotinized cigarette (double-blind). Change in 11C-raclopride binding potential (BP) in the ventral striatum from before to after smoking was determined as an indirect measure of DA release. Cigarette craving, anxiety, and mood were monitored during scanning. Smoking a regular cigarette resulted in a significantly greater mean reduction in ventral striatal 11C-raclopride BP than smoking a denicotinized cigarette. Although both groups had reductions in craving and anxiety with smoking, the regular cigarette group had a greater improvement in mood. For the total group, change in BP correlated inversely with change in mood, indicating that greater smoking-induced DA release was associated with more smoking-related mood improvement. Thus, nicotine delivered through cigarette smoking appears to be important for ventral striatal DA release.

Cordierite based wall-flow filters with high filtration efficiency, low p and good thermal durability are the product of choice for these applications. Continuous passive oxidation of the soot by NO2 is desired, however under certain operating and ambient conditions periodic active oxidation of the soot at elevated temperatures (>550oC) is required. A part of the PM emissions of the engine contains noncombustible contributions (ashes). These materials accumulate in the filter over lifetime, resulting in an increase in pressure drop as well as a reduction of the filter volume available for soot accumulation. As the pressure drop rises above manageable levels from a performance perspective, ash cleaning of the filter is required. The ash storage capacity of the filter determines the service interval for the filter. Long service intervals are desired by the end customer. To mitigate the impact of the ash accumulation in the filter, Corning Incorporated has developed filters with the proprietary asymmetric cell technology (ACT), providing high ash capacity with good strength attributes. These filters have larger inlet and smaller outlet channels and therefore a higher volume available for ash storage. The present work summarizes the results of on-engine (HD) ash testing on uncoated Robust Cordierite (RC) filters \u2013 O267mmX305mm (O10.5\u201dx12\u201d) in both Standard (200/19) and ACT (270/16) design configurations. The work demonstrates, for an equal size filter a 30% improved ash storage capacity and therefore longer service interval for the ACT design over the standard filter. Good durability of the filters for a long operation timeframe (up to 2700h) was demonstrated. Furthermore the paper summarizes a wide set of post testing evaluations, both non-destructive and destructive to understand the ash distribution and interactions in the filter. INTRODUCTION Due to their high efficiency, excellent power output and good durability aspects diesel engines have been selected as the most attractive propulsion system in key sectors of the economy. With the increase in fuel costs and further improvements in diesel engine technology the expansion of diesel engine technology in other application segments is anticipated. On the other hand the ever tightening emissions regulations require significant reduction in the tailpipe emissions. For example the US HDD on road emissions legislation requires 90% reduction in PM emissions by 2007(relative to 2006 PM limits) and 80% reduction in NOx by 2010 (relative to 2009 NOx limits). The lower emissions are achieved by improvements in engine technology and the use of advanced emissions technologies. Diesel Particulate filters are required for achieving the low PM emissions levels to meet the 2007 US on-road regulations. It is expected that the 2010 NOx limits will be achieved by further advancements in engine technology, improved controls and implementation of DeNOx technology in the form of Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system or Lean NOx Traps (LNT) or a combination of both. Cordierite wall flow monoliths have emerged as the choice of the industry for use as diesel particulate filters (DPFs) due to their compactness and robust design. The design of diesel particulate emissions systems requires balancing of various competing constraints. On the one hand the soot capacity of the filter needs to be sufficiently high to enable the desired regeneration intervals. The soot capacity is driven by the filter volume, the regeneration conditions and control strategy. On the other hand engine back pressure needs to be managed. This includes management of clean and life-time pressure drop for optimized performance of the engine. Corning\u2019s Robust Cordierite (RC) material was developed for medium and heavy duty OEMs and retrofit applications. It provides good soot loading capacity, low pressure drop and excellent durability and strength. 2007-01-0920 Improved Lifetime Pressure Drop Management for Robust Cordierite (RC) Filters with Asymmetric Cell Technology (ACT) Krishna Aravelli and Achim Heibel Corning Incorporated, Diesel Technologies Development", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "9feeab281e33c5f2ce40d3ba12be76970db259d9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "161834003", "DOI": "10.1016/0140-6701(95)97783-g", "CorpusId": 108115308}, "title": "Cofiring waste biofuels and coal for emissions reduction", "abstract": null, "year": 1995}, {"paperId": "6a3ed32d6a7b078fd700042b789197f501e76463", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1521705238", "DOI": "10.1002/er.1871", "CorpusId": 94491899}, "title": "A methodology for territorial distribution of CO2 emission reductions in transport sector", "abstract": "Greenhouse gas emission reduction is the pillar of the Kyoto Protocol and one of the main goals of the European Union (UE) energy policy.

This paper transfers global greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in both these documents to the transport sector and specifically to CO2 emissions. It proposes a nonlinear distribution method with objective, dynamic targets for reducing CO2 emissions in the transport sector, according to the context and characteristics of each geographical area. First, we analyse CO2 emissions from transport in the reference year (1990) and their evolution from 1990 to 2007. We then propose a nonlinear methodology for distributing dynamic CO2 emission reduction targets. We have applied the proposed distribution function for 2012 and 2020 at two territorial levels (EU member states and Spanish autonomous regions). The weighted distribution is based on per capita CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions per gross domestic product. Finally, we show the weighted targets found for each EU member state and each Spanish autonomous region, compare them with the real achievements to date, and forecast the situation for the years the Kyoto and EU goals are to be met. The results underline the need for \u2018weighted\u2019 decentralised decisions to be made at different territorial levels with a view to achieving a common goal, so relative convergence of all the geographical areas is reached over time.

Knowing how fuel switching, changes in economic activity and its structure, or changes in energy-use efficiency affected emissions in the past, we can better judge both the realism of national proposals to restrain future emissions and the outcome as well.

Recently, attention has been drawn towards black carbon aerosols as a short-term climate warming mitigation candidate. However the global and regional impacts of the direct, indirect and semi-direct aerosol effects are highly uncertain, due to the complex nature of aerosol evolution and the way that mixed, aged aerosols interact with clouds and radiation. A detailed aerosol microphysical scheme, MATRIX, embedded within the GISS climate model is used in this study to present a quantitative assessment of the impact of microphysical processes involving black carbon, such as emission size distributions and optical properties on aerosol cloud activation and radiative effects. Our best estimate for net direct and indirect aerosol radiative flux change between 1750 and 2000 is \u22120.56 W/m2. However, the direct and indirect aerosol effects are quite sensitive to the black and organic carbon size distribution and consequential mixing state. The net radiative flux change can vary between \u22120.32 to \u22120.75 W/m2 depending on these carbonaceous particle properties at emission. Taking into account internally mixed black carbon particles let us simulate correct aerosol absorption. Absorption of black carbon aerosols is amplified by sulfate and nitrate coatings and, even more strongly, by organic coatings. Black carbon mitigation scenarios generally showed reduced radiative fluxeswhen sources with a large proportion of black carbon, such as diesel, are reduced; however reducing sources with a larger organic carbon component as well, such as bio-fuels, does not necessarily lead to a reduction in positive radiative flux.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "1e73f4b17dd22876381b2f2dd80510348ed374c4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2551666365", "DOI": "10.1007/s11367-016-1228-0", "CorpusId": 113758788}, "title": "Life cycle environmental assessment of industrial hazardous waste incineration and landfilling in China", "abstract": "PurposeThe improper handling of industrial hazardous waste (IHW), which comprises large amounts of toxic chemicals, heavy metals, or irradiation substances, is a considerable threat to human health and the environment.

The characterization factors for the human toxicity and freshwater ecotoxicity categories shown in the ReCiPe were updated based on the geographies, population, food intake, and environmental conditions in China.Results and discussionThe overall environmental burden was mainly attributed to the carcinogen category. The national carcinogen burden in 2014 at 37.8 CTUh was dominated by diesel consumption, cement and sodium hydroxide production, direct emission, transportation, and electricity generation stages caused by direct mercury and arsenic emissions, as well as indirect chromium emission. Although the atmospheric mercury emission directly caused by IHW incineration was comparative with the emission levels of developed countries, the annual direct mercury emission accounted for approximately 0.1% of the national mercury emission.ConclusionsThe key factors contributing to the reduction of the national environmental burden include the increasing diesel and electricity consumption efficiency, the reduction of cement and sodium hydroxide use, the development of air pollutant controlling systems, the reduction of transport distance between IHW disposers to suppliers, and the improvement of IHW recycling and reuse technologies.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "13d5193066b660f011304c6dd1cc8027b5badb25", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1972567192", "DOI": "10.1021/es305093c", "CorpusId": 24963913, "PubMed": "24328118"}, "title": "Effectiveness of a segmental approach to climate policy.", "abstract": "Resistance to adopting a cap on greenhouse gas emissions internationally, and across various national contexts, has encouraged alternative climate change mitigation proposals. These proposals include separately targeting clean energy uptake and demand-side efficiency in individual end-use sectors, an approach to climate change mitigation which we characterize as segmental and technology-centered. A debate has ensued on the detailed implementation of these policies in particular national contexts, but less attention has been paid to the general factors determining the effectiveness of a segmental approach to emissions reduction. We address this topic by probing the interdependencies of segmental policies and their collective ability to control emissions. First, we show for the case of U.S. electricity how the set of suitable energy technologies depends on demand-side efficiency, and changes with the stringency of climate targets. Under a high-efficiency scenario, carbon-free technologies must supply 60-80% of U.S. electricity demand to meet an emissions reduction target of 80% below 1990 levels by midcentury. Second, we quantify the enhanced propensity to exceed any intended emissions target with this approach, even if goals are set on both the supply and demand side, due to the multiplicative accumulation of emissions error. For example, a 10% error in complying with separate policies on the demand and supply side would combine to result in a 20% error in emissions. Third, we discuss why despite these risks, the enhanced planning capability of a segmental approach may help counteract growing infrastructural inertia. The emissions reduction impediment due to infrastructural inertia is significant in the electricity sectors of each of the greatest emitters: China, the U.S., and Europe.

This allows no sector to maintain business as usual practices, while application of the precautionary principle requires avoiding a reliance on negative emission technologies. Animal to plant-sourced protein shifts offer substantial potential for GHG emission reductions. Unabated, the livestock sector could take between 37% and 49% of the GHG budget allowable under the 2\u00b0C and 1.5\u00b0C targets, respectively, by 2030. Inaction in the livestock sector would require substantial GHG reductions, far beyond what are planned or realistic, from other sectors. This outlook article outlines why animal to plant-sourced protein shifts should be taken up by the Conference of the Parties (COP), and how they could feature as part of countries\u2019 mitigation commitments under their updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to be adopted from 2020 onwards.

Failure to implement animal to plant protein shifts increases the risk of exceeding temperate goals; requires additional GHG reductions from other sectors; and increases reliance on negative emissions technologies.

To be a reliable predictor of response, changes in tumour [18F]FDG uptake should reflect changes in viable cell fraction, but little is known about the contribution of apoptotic and necrotic cancer cells and inflammatory tissue to the [18F]FDG signal. In a tumour mouse model we investigated the relation between chemotherapy-induced changes in various tumoral components and tumour uptake and size. SCID mice were subcutaneously inoculated in the right thigh with 5\u00d7106 Daudi cells. When the tumour measured 15\u201320\u00a0mm, Endoxan was given intravenously. At different time points [1\u201315 days (d1\u2013d15) after the injection of Endoxan], ex vivo autoradiography and histopathology were performed in two mice and [18F]FDG uptake in the tumour and tumour size were correlated with the different cell fractions measured with flow cytometry in five mice. At d1/d3, similar reductions in [18F]FDG uptake and viable tumoral cell fraction were observed and these reductions preceded changes in tumour size. By d8/d10, [18F]FDG uptake had stabilised despite a further reduction in viable tumoral cell fraction. At these time points a major inflammatory response was observed. At d15, an increase in viable tumour cells was again observed and this was accurately predicted by an increase in [18F]FDG uptake, while the tumour volume remained unchanged. In contrast with variations in tumour volume, [18F]FDG is a good marker for chemotherapy response monitoring. However, optimal timing seems crucial since a transient increase in stromal reaction may result in overestimation of the fraction of viable cells.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "0a68056969883ac15744d17935862b17c6d941c6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2340320725", "CorpusId": 10635787}, "title": "A Framework to Estimate the Potential and Costs for the Control of Fine Particulate Emissions in Europe", "abstract": "This paper presents a methodology for estimating primary PM emissions in Europe and the costs involved to reduce these emissions from the various sources in the European countries. The framework developed is compatible with existing approaches to estimate emissions and costs for SO2, NOx, NH3 and VOC in the RAINS model. \n \nEmissions of PM are released from a large variety of sources with significant technical and economic differences. The emission characteristic of the sources is also strongly influenced by country-specific conditions. The method applied considers the crucial parameters and allows sectoral and regional variation. The emissions of particulate matter (PM) in the RAINS model are calculated for three different size classes (i) fine fraction (PM2.5), (ii) coarse fraction (PM10 - PM2.5) and (iii) large particles (PM_>10 mu m). \n \nA methodology has been developed to estimate emission control costs of standard technologies under the specific conditions characteristic for the various European countries. Based on the assumption of the general availability of control technologies with equal technical properties and costs, a number of country-specific circumstances (level of technological advancement, installation size distribution, labor costs, etc.) are used to estimate the costs for the actual operation of pollution control equipment. \n \nBased on the developed methodology, a first estimate of the PM emissions in Europe was derived for the years 1990, 1995 and 2010. This estimate must be considered as preliminary, since many of the emission factors need revision and update with additional information. The projections for the year 2010 assume full implementation of the current legislation on emission controls, e.g., the EURO-IV emission standards resulting from the Auto Oil process for mobile sources, and regulations relating to the large combustion plant directive of the European Union. Major reductions in PM emissions occurred between 1990 and 1995, mainly because of the economic restructuring in Eastern Europe where many old coal power stations were retired. Between 1990 and 1995, TSP emissions declined by 41 percent; for 2010 a decline of 58 percent is projected. Emission reductions are most efficient for larger particles; for 2010, PM10 is calculated to decline by 56 percent, and PM2.5 by 48 percent. Consequently, fine fraction (PM2.5) will be relatively more important in the future (38 percent of TSP in 2010) compared to 31 percent of TSP in 1990. \n \nIn 1990, combustion in energy industries, small non-industrial combustion sources, production processes and road transport contributed about 20 percent each to total TSP emissions in the EU-15. In the non-EU countries, small sources and power plants were responsible for more than 30 percent each, while road transport contributed only three percent of TSP. In those countries, small sources (domestic coal and wood combustion) are expected to increase their share to 45 percent in 2010, while in the EU-15 mobile sources will become the most important source category for TSP emissions (45 percent). \n \nFor PM2.5, mobile sources were the largest contributor in 1990 in the EU-15 countries (31 percent). This share is expected to decline slightly by 2010 (28 percent) due to the strict regulations that were recently introduced. In the non-EU countries, industrial production processes were the largest source of PM2.5 emissions (36 percent), while in 2010 small combustion sources in the domestic sector will dominate (38 percent). \n \nThe present implementation (version 1.03) of the RAINS PM module on the Internet (www.iiasa.ac.at/~rains/PM/pm-home.html) provides free access to the input data and results to facilitate interaction with national experts.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "fec6d05d768ec9c75d116a760cf9fd2814ce19fc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2110398213", "DOI": "10.1002/anie.201104004", "CorpusId": 2706273, "PubMed": "21954126"}, "title": "Co(1-x)S-graphene hybrid: a high-performance metal chalcogenide electrocatalyst for oxygen reduction.", "abstract": "Owing to their high energy-conversion efficiency, low or even zero emission, and high energy and power density, fuel cells such as proton-exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) have drawn tremendous attention as potential clean and efficient power sources for both electric vehicles and portable electronics. 2] A major limiting factor of energy-conversion efficiency for present fuel cells is the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode. Platinum and its alloys have been so far the most active ORR catalysts. However, the prohibitive cost, scarcity, and declining activity of Pt-based catalysts have hindered widespread application and commercialization of fuel cells. Consequently, alternative electrocatalysts based on nonprecious metals have been actively pursued. Cobalt sulfides have been investigated as ORR catalyst with the highest activity among all chalcogenides of nonprecious metals in acidic solution. Theoretical studies predicted electrocatalytic activity of Co9S8 similar to that of Pt via a four-electron ORR pathway. However, current ORR catalysts based on cobalt sulfides and cobalt selenides have exhibited activities far lower than that of Pt. Moreover, it has been shown that two-electron reduction is the dominant reaction pathway for cobalt sulfide catalysts, especially at potentials higher than 0.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). It is thus highly desirable to design and synthesize high-performance cobalt chalcogenide based electrocatalyst materials capable of catalyzing fourelectron ORR. Here we describe a novel cobalt sulfide\u2013graphene hybrid electrocatalyst for ORR, obtained by controlled two-step synthesis of Co1 xS nanoparticles on reduced graphene oxide (RGO). The RGO sheets underlying the Co1 xS nanoparticles provide an electrically conducting support for the catalyst, control the size of the catalyst particles, and enhance the ORR catalytic activity of the Co1 xS nanoparticles through strong electrochemical coupling. In 0.5m H2SO4, our Co1 xS/ RGO hybrid catalyst shows an ORR current onset at about 0.8 V versus RHE. When the electrode is rotated at 1600 rpm, the ORR current density is as high as about 1.1 mA cm 2 at 0.7 V versus RHE with a loading of about 100 mg cm . Measurements with both rotating disk electrode (RDE) and rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) show that nearly fourelectron ORR can be achieved with the Co1 xS/RGO hybrid catalyst. The Co1 xS/RGO hybrid is the highest performance ORR catalyst among all cobalt chalcogenide based materials reported in the literature. Cobalt sulfide nanoparticles were synthesized on RGO sheets by a low-temperature solution-phase reaction followed by a high-temperature annealing step. Graphene oxide (GO) was made by a modified Hummers method (see Supporting Information), in which a six times lower concentration of KMnO4 was used (see Supporting Information) to give GO sheets with lower oxygen content than Hummers GO (ca. 15 vs. ca. 30 %, measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Auger spectroscopy). In the first reaction step, nanoparticles of cobalt sulfide precursor were selectively and uniformly coated onto GO surface by treating Co(OAc)2 with thioacetamide (TAA) in a GO/water suspension at 80 8C for 12 h (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The intermediate product was then annealed at 500 8C in 1 atm of Ar for 1 h to give the final hybrid material of cobalt sulfide nanoparticles on graphene (see Supporting Information for experimental details). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) clearly revealed that cobalt sulfide nanoparticles were selectively grown on RGO sheets without free growth of unattached nanoparticles in solution (Figure 1a, b, and d). The cobalt sulfide nanoparticles on RGO were crystalline with an average particle size of about 10\u201320 nm (Figure 1b and d). X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure 1c) showed that the cobalt sulfide nanoparticles grown on RGO are a Co1 xS phase (ICDD PDF #00-0420826) with hexagonal structure in space group P63/mmc (no. 194). The lattice fringes of the Co1 xS nanocrystals (Figure 1d) and the electron diffraction pattern (Figure 1d inset) are consistent with the crystal structure. The Co1 xS/ RGO hybrid contains about 30 wt % of RGO with a designed Co/C ratio of 1/4. The ORR catalytic activity of Co1 xS/RGO was first characterized by loading the hybrid material onto glassy carbon electrode for cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements in 0.5m H2SO4 at 25 8C (see Supporting Information for experimental details). Comparison of CV curves in O2versus Ar-saturated electrolyte clearly revealed the ORR catalytic activity of Co1 xS/RGO. The hybrid showed an ORR onset potential at about 0.8 V versus RHE, and the peak current was reached at about 0.73 V versus RHE (Figure 2a). Measurements with an RDE were carried out to reveal the ORR kinetics of the Co1 xS/RGO hybrid in 0.5m H2SO4 (Figure 2b). At 1600 rpm, the Co1 xS/RGO hybrid catalyst showed a current density of about 1.1 mAcm 2 at 0.7 V versus [*] H. Wang, Y. Liang, Y. Li, Prof. H.

The decrease of the light emission pressure coefficient may be as large as 30% for a 32 monolayer (8 nm) thick quantum well. We explain this effect by the hydrostatic-pressure-induced increase of the piezoelectric field in quantum structures.

A complete optical and structural characterization was carried out: the optical emission was centred at 416 nm, with a luminescence quantum yield in water of 3.6% (the highest one reported so far in water for this kind of nanocluster). The structural characterization reveals a homogeneous size distribution (of 2.5 nm diameter) with spherical shape. The CuNCs obtained offer long-term stability (the luminescence emission remained unaltered after more than two months) under a broad range of chemical conditions (e.g., stored at pH 3-12 or even in a high ionic strength medium such as 1 M NaCl) and high photostability, keeping their fluorescence emission intact after more than 2 h of daylight and UV-light exposition.

Recent optical engine data revealed that when the start of injection (SOI) was retarded to very late timings, combustion luminosity decreased while exhaust NOx emissions increased, causing a \"NOx bump.\" This data suggested that changes in radiative heat transfer from soot may affect in-cylinder temperatures and subsequent NOx formation. In this study, soot thermometry measurements of in-cylinder temperature and radiative heat transfer were correlated with exhaust NOx to quantify the role of radiative heat transfer on in-cylinder temperatures and NOx formation. The engine was operated at low-load conditions, for which the premixed burn was a significant fraction of the total heat release. Soot thermometry showed that radiative cooling reduced flame temperatures by 25-50 K for early SOI, reducing exhaust NOx by 12-25%. Near the NOx bump, radiative cooling was essentially absent, and the NOx reduction was thus removed. Radiative cooling alone, however, was found to be insufficient to be solely responsible for the observed changes in NOx emissions. Thermodynamic analysis showed that in the slow-mixing limit, compression-heating of burned gases for the large premixed-burn conditions near the NOx bump can also increase temperatures by about 25 K, for a further 12% increase in NOx. The data also shows that these two factors can contribute to other exhaust NO observations, such as the intake temperature optimum for minimizing NOx emissions. Finally, although it was not directly measured, the rate of post-flame mixing was identified and examined as a third primary factor affecting in-cylinder temperatures and NOx formation in diesel engines.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "863796ef3fd58e1d46703d663fc25f60738e3e87", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2169855603", "DOI": "10.1007/BF00334584", "CorpusId": 35241505}, "title": "Oxidation of methane in the rhizosphere of rice plants", "abstract": "Oxidation of CH4 in the rhizosphere of rice plants was quantified using (1) methyl fluoride, a specific inhibitor of CH4 oxidation, and (2) measuring changes in plant-mediated CH4 emission after incubation under air, N2, or 40% O2. No significant rhizospheric CH4 oxidation was observed from rice plants in the ripening stage. CH4 emission from rice plants 1 week before panicle initiation increased by 40% if CH4 oxidation in the rhizosphere was blocked. The growth stage of the rice plant is an important factor determining the rhizospheric CH4 oxidation. Fluctuation of rhizospheric CH4 oxidation during the growing season may help to explain the observed seasonal CH4 emission patterns in field studies. Measurements from four rice varieties showed that one variety, Pokkali, had higher rhizospheric CH4 oxidation. This was probably because Pokkali was in an earlier growth stage than the other three varieties. Both in the early and in the late growth stages, incubation under N2 caused a much stronger CH4 flux than inhibition of CH4 oxidation alone. Apparently, N2 incubation not only blocked CH4 oxidation but also stimulated methanogenesis in the rhizosphere. Incubation under a higher O2 atmosphere (40% O2) than ambient air decreased the CH4 flux, suggesting that increasing the oxidation of the rice rhizosphere may help in reducing CH4 fluxes from rice agriculture. The O2 pressure in the rhizosphere is an important factor that reduces the plant-mediated CH4 flux.

Jet fuel was blended with the soybean oil-derived methyl ester biofuel at various concentrations and combusted in the turbine engine. The engine was operated at three power settings, namely ground idle, cruise, and takeoff power, to study the impact of the biodiesel at significantly different pressure and temperature conditions. Particulate emissions were characterized by measuring the particle number density (PND; particulate concentration), the particle size distribution, and the total particulate mass. PM samples were collected for off-line analysis to obtain information about the effect of the biodiesel on the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) content. In addition, temperature-programmed oxidation was performed on the collected soot samples to obtain information about the carbonaceous content (elemental or organic). Major and minor gaseous emissions were quantified using a total hydrocarbon analyzer, an oxygen analyzer, and a Fourier Transform IR analyzer. Test results showed the potential of biodiesel to reduce soot emissions in the jet-fueled turbine engine without negatively impacting the engine performance. These reductions, however, were observed only at the higher power settings with relatively high concentrations of biodiesel. Specifically, reductions of \u223c15% in the PND were observed at cruise and takeoff conditions with 20% biodiesel in the jet fuel. At the idle condition, slight increases in PND were observed; however, evidence shows this increase to be the result of condensed uncombusted biodiesel. Most of the gaseous emissions were unaffected under all of the conditions. The biodiesel was observed to have minimal effect on the formation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons during this study.

The primary objectives were to verify emissions inventories and demonstrate the feasibility of installing affordable emissions reduction technology on marine vessels as well as compliance with future regulatory emissions limits. The tests also provided an opportunity for Canada to share information on emissions program and technology developments with U.S. regulatory authorities. This may lead to developing joint emissions reduction initiatives for existing marine vessels. This paper describes the field-testing of a water injection system (WIS) to reduce oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions from ocean-going vessels. Tests were conducted on a semi-dedicated basis during voyage and under steady-state conditions. The emissions measurements were taken in accordance with ISO 8178-4-E3 protocol and using both marine diesel oil and intermediate fuel oil, which enabled the evaluation of the impact of different fuel type and quality on emissions. An initial series of tests was carried out on the MV Cabot in March 2004, followed by a second series of tests on the same vessel in March 2005. These tests demonstrated the effectiveness of a low-cost WIS for reducing NOx emissions in marine diesel engines. They also showed that water injection reduces NOx at the expense of an increase in both particulate matter and carbon monoxide when using intermediate fuel oil. NOx reductions varied between 10 and 35 percent, and were most effective at high water injection ratios above 50 percent engine load. The test results showed no negative impact of the WIS on fuel consumption or engine operation and performance. This paper compares the results obtained from the consecutive series of tests in terms of the effectiveness of NOx reduction, and analyses the results in the context of other full-scale test results obtained from emissions control system vendors and engine suppliers. It also investigates the theoretical process and technology of water injection through charge air fumigation, and both direct water and fuel/water emulsion injection. In addition, the effects of water injection on engine emissions, operation and maintenance, and the optimization of water injection from a knowledge-based perspective are discussed. Further testing and development of the WIS are required to realize optimal emissions reduction potential and to determine the impact of water injection on fuel consumption, and engine operational performance as well as the impact of fuel quality on emissions.Copyright \u00a9 2005 by Transport Canada (Government of Canada)", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "39f35315b2e7a5fdee229fb369a63f23a8b9af8c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2233133057", "DOI": "10.4271/1999-01-3592", "CorpusId": 129978504}, "title": "Fuel Quality Requirements for Reduction of Diesel Emissions", "abstract": null, "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "cf1c0e158bf8d7de8221394b47b9fe583909f611", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2156922953", "DOI": "10.1007/978-94-007-1905-7_4", "CorpusId": 131443691}, "title": "Emissions of Ammonia, Nitrous Oxide and Methane During the Management of Solid Manures", "abstract": "Organic manures arising from livestock production provide a source of plant nutrients when applied to agricultural land. However, only about 52% of the N excreted by livestock is estimated to be recycled as a plant nutrient. The \u00adgreatest losses of N from livestock excreta and manures are as gaseous emissions. These emissions are in the form of ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4). Ammonia forms particles in the atmosphere which reduce visibility and may also harm human health, and when deposited to land NH3 causes nutrient enrichment of soil. Nitrous oxide and CH4 contribute significantly to global warming and N2O can also cause the breakdown of the protective ozone layer in the upper atmosphere. We established a database of emissions from solid manures. Statistical analysis provided new information, focussing on developing emission factors, emission algorithms and also new understanding of emission patterns from solid manure. The review found that housing systems with deep litter emit more NH3 than tied stalls. This is likely to be because the emitting surface area in a tied stall is smaller. Laying hens emit more NH3 than broilers and reduced-emission housing systems for poultry, including the aviary system, can reduce NH3 emissions by between 50% and 80%. The greatest N2O-N emissions from buildings housing livestock were also from deep litter systems, but the amount of N2O-N was smaller than that of NH3-N by a factor of 15. Air exchange and temperature increase induced by aerobic decomposition during manure storage may greatly increase NH3 emission. Emissions of 0.25\u20130.30 of the total-N have been recorded from pig and cattle manure heaps undergoing aerobic decomposition. Increased density of manure during storage significantly decreased temperatures in manure heaps. Storing solid manures at high density also reduces air exchange which with the low temperature limits the formation and transfer of NH3 to the surface layers of the heap, reducing emissions. Most N2O emission estimates from cattle and pig manure have been between 0.001 and 0.009 of total-N. Emission of N2O from poultry manure tends to be small. Average unabated NH3 emissions following application of manure were 0.79, 0.63 and 0.40 of total ammoniacal-N (TAN) from cattle, pig and poultry manure respectively. The smaller emission from poultry manure is expected as hydrolysis of uric acid to urea may take many months and is often incomplete even after application, hence limiting the potential for NH3 emission. Manure incorporation within 4 h after application reduced emission on average by 32%, 92% and 85% for cattle, pig and poultry manure respectively. Reductions following incorporation within 24 h or more after application were 20%, 56% and 50% for cattle, pigs and poultry, respectively. Incorporation by disc or harrow reduced NH3 emissions less than incorporation by plough. Emissions of N2O following the application of cattle manure were 0.12 of TAN without incorporation after application and 0.073 TAN with incorporation after application. Conversely, emissions following application of pig and poultry manures were 0.003 and 0.001 TAN respectively without and 0.035 and 0.089 TAN respectively with incorporation after application.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "8ea3d71bd3192c807a160c68cf80d3f735c7e908", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2515661237", "DOI": "10.1007/978-3-319-29794-1", "CorpusId": 45440314}, "title": "Methods for Measuring Greenhouse Gas Balances and Evaluating Mitigation Options in Smallholder Agriculture", "abstract": "This book provides standards and guidelines for quantifying greenhouse gas emissions and removals in smallholder agricultural systems and comparing options for climate change mitigation based on emission reductions and livelihood trade-offs.

Farms in the developing countries of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia are predominately managed by smallholders, with 80% of land holdings smaller than ten hectares.

Greenhouse gas measurements in agriculture are expensive, time consuming, and error prone, challenges only exacerbated by the heterogeneity of smallholder systems and landscapes.

This analysis examines the costs, emissions, source-specific and location-specific allocations of NOX emissions reductions and the ancillary ozone related health benefits under a range of policy scenarios. The paper includes analysis of three separate policies. The first is a detailed analysis of the effect on nitrate loadings to the Bay of command and control policies specified in the Clean Air Act and as part of the OTAG process. The second is a comparison of alternative scenarios for reducing NOX emissions that meet nitrate loading goals, with or without concern for reducing ozone concentrations and the health effects they cause. The third is a comparison of alternative approaches to allocate NOX emissions to meet NOX reduction and ozone exposure goals while capturing the ancillary effect on nitrate loadings. This last analysis focuses on the stake the Bay jurisdictions have in the outcome of negotiations over NOX trading programs being developed by EPA for reducing ozone in the Eastern U.S. With the primary focus on the Chesapeake Bay jurisdiction, all three analyses integrate the ancillary ozone benefits of policies to reduce nitrate pollution, including examination of how these ancillary benefits change under alternative meteorological episodes, and explore lower cost alternatives to current regulatory programs in both qualitative and quantitative terms. We find that the Chesapeake Bay benefits from efforts to reduce NOX emissions to meet the ambient air quality standard for ozone. Airborne NOX emission reductions slated to occur under the Clean Air Act in the Bay airshed will reduce nitrate loadings to the Bay by about 27 percent of the baseline airborne levels. The additional controls of NOX contemplated in what we term the OTAG scenario is estimated to result in an additional 20 percent reduction from this baseline. However, the paper's analysis of possible least cost options shows that the costs of obtaining such reductions can be significantly reduced by rearranging the allocation of emissions reductions to take advantage of source-type and locational considerations. In addition, we find that adding consideration of ancillary ozone-related health benefits to the picture does not alter any qualitative conclusions. Quantitatively, unless a link between ozone and mortality risk is assumed, the benefits are too small to affect the cost-saving allocations of NOX reductions. If the case for such a link can be made, the results change dramatically, with large overall increases in NOX reductions and a relative shift in controls to non-Bay states and utility sources. These specific effects are sensitive to the source-receptor coefficients linking NOX to ozone, however. Our analyses also suggest that the Bay jurisdictions have a stake in the outcome of the NOX trading debate -- that some trading designs can lead to better outcomes for these jurisdictions than others. Nevertheless, a common feature of cost-savings policies is that they both rearrange emissions reductions and, in the aggregate, reduce emissions less than a command and control system. Thus, some trading regimes result in significantly smaller loadings reductions (up to 25 percent smaller) than the command and control approach.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "5e0760b8a6e40d902d11f244b0759d0e55151d26", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1979697700", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-012-0426-4", "CorpusId": 153988149}, "title": "Scenarios of methane emission reductions to 2030: abatement costs and co-benefits to ozone air quality and human mortality", "abstract": "Methane emissions contribute to global baseline surface ozone concentrations; therefore reducing methane to address climate change has significant co-benefits for air quality and human health. We analyze the costs of reducing methane from 2005 to 2030, as might be motivated to reduce climate forcing, and the resulting benefits from lower surface ozone to 2060. We construct three plausible scenarios of methane emission reductions, relative to a base scenario, ranging from 75 to 180 Mton CH4 yr\u22121 decreased in 2030. Using compilations of the global availability of methane emission reductions, the least aggressive scenario (A) does not incur any positive marginal costs to 2030, while the most aggressive (C) requires discovery of new methane abatement technologies. The present value of implementation costs for Scenario B are nearly equal to Scenario A, as it implements cost-saving options more quickly, even though it adopts positive cost measures. We estimate the avoided premature human mortalities due to surface ozone decreases by combining transient full-chemistry simulations of these scenarios in a global atmospheric chemical transport model, with concentration-mortality relationships from a short-term epidemiologic study and projected global population. An estimated 38,000 premature mortalities are avoided globally in 2030 under Scenario B. As benefits of methane reduction are positive but costs are negative for Scenario A, it is justified regardless of how avoided mortalities are valued. The incremental benefits of Scenario B also far outweigh the incremental costs. Scenario C has incremental costs that roughly equal benefits, only when technological learning is assumed. Benefits within industrialized nations alone also exceed costs in Scenarios A and B, assuming that the lowest-cost emission reductions, including those in developing nations, are implemented. Monetized co-benefits of methane mitigation for human health are estimated to be $13\u201317 per ton CO2eq, with a wider range possible under alternative assumptions.

In this article, we analyze the potential implementation of Li-ion batteries in a platform supply vessel system through simulations using HOMER software (Hybrid Optimization Model for Multiple Energy Resources). We evaluate the impact of battery characteristics such as round trip efficiency, rated power, and energy capacity. We also evaluate the potential CO 2 emissions reduction that could be achieved with two of the most common types of Li-ion batteries (lithium titanate, lithium iron phosphate). Furthermore, we consider that the Li-ion batteries are installed in a 20 ft container. Results indicate that the lithium iron phosphate battery has a better performance, even though the difference between both technologies is lower than 1% of total emissions. We also analyze the potential emissions reduction for different parts of a mission to an offshore platform for different configurations of the ship power system. The most significant potential CO 2 emissions reduction among the analyzed cases is 8.7% of the total emissions, and it is achieved by the configuration including the main and auxiliary diesel engines as well as batteries. Finally, we present managerial implications of these results for both companies operating ships and ship building companies.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "cd9f9d836f5a89e0685ad141ab2b231b566c2b66", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2075112518", "DOI": "10.1109/PES.2010.5589272", "CorpusId": 12702592}, "title": "Evolution of operating reserve determination in wind power integration studies", "abstract": "The growth of wind power as an electrical power generation resource has produced great benefits with reductions in emissions and the supply of zero cost fuel.

The proposed fuel candidates include furans, ethers, alcohols, and ketones. Experiments with the isomers di-n-butyl ether and 1-octanol have proven their suitability for diesel-type combustion. With di-n-butyl ether being prone to auto-ignition, overall hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and soot emissions are reduced compared to diesel.

From the results, it is observed that the biodiesel performance and emissions are lower than that of diesel fuel. However, the NOx emission of Jatropha biodiesel is more than that of diesel fuel. These high NOx emissions are due to the presence of unsaturated fatty acids and the advanced injection caused by the higher bulk modulus (or density) of Jatropha biodiesel Furthermore, the possibility for reduction of NOx emissions without expensive engine modifications (hardware) was investigated. Keeping this in mind, the Jatropha biodiesel was preheated. The experimental results show that the retarded injection timing is necessary when using Jatropha biodiesel in order to reduce NOx emission without worsening other engine characteristics.

One of these fuels is so called biodiesel produced from vegetable oil by transesterification into fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). To get a first insight into changes of health hazards from diesel engine emissions (DEE) by use of biodiesel scientific studies were reviewed which compared the combustion of FAME with common diesel fuel (DF) for legally regulated and non-regulated emissions as well as for toxic effects. A total number of 62 publications on chemical analyses of DEE and 18 toxicological in vitro studies were identified meeting the criteria. In addition, a very small number of human studies and animal experiments were available. In most studies, combustion of biodiesel reduces legally regulated emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and particulate matter. Nitrogen oxides are regularly increased. Among the non-regulated emissions aldehydes are increased, while polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are lowered. Most biological in vitro assays show a stronger cytotoxicity of biodiesel exhaust and the animal experiments reveal stronger irritant effects. Both findings are possibly caused by the higher content of nitrogen oxides and aldehydes in biodiesel exhaust. The lower content of PAH is reflected by a weaker mutagenicity compared to DF exhaust. However, recent studies show a very low mutagenicity of DF exhaust as well, probably caused by elimination of sulfur in present DF qualities and the use of new technology diesel engines. Combustion of vegetable oil (VO) in common diesel engines causes a strongly enhanced mutagenicity of the exhaust despite nearly unchanged regulated emissions.

The feature provides an important probe of the mass-loss rate in the base of the stellar wind of the supergiant star. We derive an updated ephemeris for the orbit based on radial velocities measured from He I \u03bb6678. We list net equivalent widths for the entire H\u03b1 emission/absorption complex, and we find that there are large variations in emission strength over both long (years) and short (hours to days) time spans. There are coherent orbital phase-related variations in the profiles when the spectra are grouped by H\u03b1 equivalent width. The profiles consist of (1) a P Cygni component associated with the wind of the supergiant, (2) emission components that attain high velocity at the conjunctions and that probably form in enhanced outflows both toward and away from the black hole, and (3) an emission component that moves in antiphase with the supergiant's motion. We argue that the third component forms in accreted gas near the black hole and that the radial velocity curve of the emission is consistent with a mass ratio of MX/Mopt \u2248 0.36 \u00b1 0.05. We find that there is a general anticorrelation between the H\u03b1 emission strength and X-ray flux (from the Rossi X-Ray Timing Explorer All Sky Monitor) in the sense that when the H\u03b1 emission is strong (W\u03bb < -0.5 A) the X-ray flux is weaker and the spectrum harder. On the other hand, there is no correlation between H\u03b1 emission strength and X-ray flux when H\u03b1 is weak. We argue that this relationship is not caused by wind X-ray absorption nor by the reduction in H\u03b1 emissivity by X-ray heating. Instead, we suggest that the H\u03b1 variations track changes in wind density and strength near the photosphere. The density of the wind determines the size of X-ray ionization zones surrounding the black hole, and these in turn control the acceleration of the wind in the direction of the black hole. During the low/hard X-ray state, the strong wind is fast and the accretion rate is relatively low, while during the high/soft state, the weaker, highly ionized wind attains only a moderate velocity and the accretion rate increases. We argue that the X-ray transitions from the normal low/hard to the rare high/soft state are triggered by episodes of decreased mass-loss rate in the supergiant donor star.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "685a1251e660543f87e2f74c2cd999d19d92f744", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1983331693", "DOI": "10.1016/J.COMBUSTFLAME.2008.01.011", "CorpusId": 94751665}, "title": "Reduction of soot emissions by iron pentacarbonyl in isooctane diffusion flames", "abstract": null, "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "1bd053cad1cbcbe5344aff35f29c338d030ed0f8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2070738461", "DOI": "10.1021/EF800221G", "CorpusId": 97759888}, "title": "Combustion Characteristics and NOx Emissions of a Dimethyl-Ether-Fueled Premixed Charge Compression Ignition Engine", "abstract": "This work investigated premixed charge combustion ignition (PCCI) and partial premixed charge compression ignition (PPCCI) combustions for dimethyl ether (DME) fuel to obtain a dramatic reduction in NO x emissions.

At higher engine load conditions, a dual injection strategy consisting of an initial injection at 100\u00b0 BTDC and a second injection later than top dead center (TDC) offered extremely low NO x emissions while maintaining moderate engine output. The second injection timing, which was later than 10\u00b0 after top dead center (ATDC), showed a reduction in NO x emissions by over 90% compared to the single-injection case, in which the lowest NO x emission levels could be achieved.

This paper analyses the heat release patterns during the combustion process and co-relates the results with the exhaust emissions. The EGR effects considered include the dilution of the inlet charge with CO2 or water vapour, the increase in the inlet charge temperature, and the thermal throttling arising from the use of hot EGR. The use of diluents (CO2 and H 2O), which are the principal constituents of EGR, caused an increase in ignition delay and a shift in the location of start of combustion. As a consequence of this shift, the whole combustion process was also shifted further towards the expansion stroke. This resulted in the products of combustion spending shorter periods at high temperatures which lowered the NOx formation rate. In addition, the longer ignition delay period provided more time for the fuel top penetrate which could have led to larger amounts of gases in the flame envelop, thereby lowering the combustion temperature and resulting in lower NOx formation. Although the increased ignition delay period is expected to cause increasing amount of fuel being burned during the pre-mixed burning period, however, the reduction in oxygen availability associated with the application of EGR diluents reduced the rate at which the fuel burnt in the pre-mixed phase. Moreover, the shift of the combustion process towards the expansion stroke resulted in earlier quenching of the combustion process, that is, shorter combustion duration, which yielded higher levels of products of incomplete combustion in the exhaust. The different effects of inlet charge thermal throttling (associated with the use of hot EGR) were simulated and the heat release patterns were analysed. The reduction in the inlet charge oxygen, resulting from throttling the inlet charge, caused an increase in the ignition delay; however, this increase was largely offset by reductions in ignition delay due to increased inlet charge temperature and decreased inlet charge mass.

Highest N2O emissions during freezing and thawing were measured from soil previously treated with nitrate (NO3-). The emitted N2O was produced via reduction of NO3-. The steady drop in N2O emission at soil temperatures higher than 2 \u00b0C coincided with large dinitrogen (N2) emissions which most likely reflected the increasing enzymatic activity of N2O reductase with increasing temperatures.

We therefore carried out a 3-year experiment in a paddy field in Central Java, Indonesia to investigate the feasibility of AWD in terms of rice productivity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, and water use both in wet and dry seasons (WS and DS). The treatments of water management were (1) continuous flooding (CF), (2) flooding every when surface water level naturally declines to 15 cm below the soil surface (AWD), and (3) site-specific AWD with different criteria of soil drying (AWDS) established to find out the optimum for GHG emission reduction. Gas flux measurement was conducted by a static closed chamber method. Rice growth was generally normal and the grain yield did not significantly differ among the three treatments both in WS and DS. AWD and AWDS significantly reduced the total water use (irrigation + rainfall) as compared to CF. As expected, the seasonal total CH4 emission was significantly reduced by AWD and AWDS. On average, the CH4 emissions under AWD and AWDS were 35 and 38%, respectively, smaller than those under CF. It should be noted that AWD and AWDS were effective even in WS due partly to the field location on inland, upland area that facilitates the drainage. The seasonal total N2O emission did not significantly differ among the treatments.

This study compares the reduction in system emissions to the emissions from the DG to determine the net savings. Some of the major findings are that 85% of the electricity displaced by DG during peak hours will be simple cycle natural gas, either steam or combustion turbine. Even with DG running as baseload, 57% of electricity displaced will be simple cycle natural gas. Despite the retirement of some gas-fired steam units and the construction of many new gas turbine and combined cycle units, the marginal emissions from the system remain quite high (1.4 lb NO{sub x}/MWh on peak and 1.1 lb NO{sub x}/MWh baseload) compared to projected DG emissions. Consequently, additions of DG capacity will reduce emissions in Texas from power generation in 2012.

Aerosol particles were characterized by an Aerodyne aerosol chemical speciation monitor along with various collocated instruments in Beijing, China, to investigate the role of fireworks (FW) and secondary aerosol in particulate pollution during the Chinese Spring Festival of 2013. Three FW events, exerting significant and short-term impacts on fine particles (PM2.5), were observed on the days of Lunar New Year, Lunar Fifth Day, and Lantern Festival. The FW were shown to have a large impact on non-refractory potassium, chloride, sulfate, and organics in submicron aerosol (PM1), of which FW organics appeared to be emitted mainly in secondary, with its mass spectrum resembling that of secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Pollution events (PEs) and clean periods (CPs) alternated routinely throughout the study. Secondary particulate matter (SPM = SOA + sulfate + nitrate + ammonium) dominated the total PM1 mass on average, accounting for 63\u201382% during nine PEs in this study. The elevated contributions of secondary species during PEs resulted in a higher mass extinction efficiency of PM1 (6.4 m2 g-1) than during CPs (4.4 m2 g-1). The Chinese Spring Festival also provides a unique opportunity to study the impact of reduced anthropogenic emissions on aerosol chemistry in the city. Primary species showed ubiquitous reductions during the holiday period with the largest reduction being in cooking organic aerosol (OA; 69%), in nitrogen monoxide (54%), and in coal combustion OA (28%). Secondary sulfate, however, remained only slightly changed, and the SOA and the total PM2.5 even slightly increased. Our results have significant implications for controlling local primary source emissions during PEs, e.g., cooking and traffic activities.

Analysis using structural equation models finds that residents living in a neighborhood with higher land use mix, public transit accessibility, and more pedestrian-friendly street design tend to travel in a \u201clow-carbon\u201d manner and emit less CO2 in daily travel, even controlling for residential and travel preferences.

Archival data from the WSRT was reduced and a new calibration technique introduced to reach the high dynamic ranges needed for the complex source morphology of M82. This data was combined with archival VLA data, yielding total power maps at 3cm, 6cm, 22cm and 92cm. The data shows a confinement of the emission at wavelengths of 3/6cm to the core region and a largely extended halo reaching up to 4kpc away from the galaxy midplane at wavelengths of 22/92cm up to a sensitivity limit of 90muJy and 1.8mJy respectively. The results are used to calculate the magnetic field strength in the core region to 98muG and to 24muG in the halo regions. From the observation of free-free losses the filling factor of the ionised medium could be estimated to 2%. We find that the radio emission from the core region is dominated by very dense HII-regions and supernova remnants, while the surrounding medium is filled with hot X-ray and neutral gas. Cosmic rays radiating at frequencies higher than 1.4 GHz are suffering from high synchrotron and inverse Compton losses in the core region and are not able to reach the halo. Even the cosmic rays radiating at longer wavelengths are only able to build up the observed kpc sized halo, when several starbursting periods are assumed where the photon field density varies by an order of magnitude. These findings together with the strong correlation between Halpha, PAH+, and our radio continuum data suggests a magnetic field which is frozen into the ionised medium and driven out of the galaxy kinematically.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "af7de2ab696e248572a1475bc169958871062400", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1975641831", "DOI": "10.1115/1.3124791", "CorpusId": 109761249}, "title": "Experimental Study on Effects of Nozzle Hole Geometry on Achieving Low Diesel Engine Emissions", "abstract": "Three injectors with different nozzle geometries were tested in a multicylinder diesel engine with a high-pressure common-rail injection system.

Effects of the convergent nozzle on NO x emissions and fuel consumption were not significant.

The observations are combined with IRAS fluxes to define the spectral energy distributions of the sources. Most of the sources show only photospheric emission at near-IR wavelengths, indicating a lack of hot (,1000 K) dust. Mid-infrared spectra are presented for four sources from the sample. One of them, HD 150193, shows strong silicate emission, while another, HD 176363, was not detected. The spectra of two stars from our previous sample of Vega-like sources both show UIR-band emission, attributed to hydrocarbon materials. Detailed comparisons of the optical and IRAS positions suggest that in some cases the IRAS source is not physically associated with the visible star. Alternative associations are suggested for several of these sources. Fractional excess luminosities are derived from the observed spectral energy distributions. The values found are comparable to those measured previously for other Vega-like sources. Key words: circumstellar matter \u00b1 planetary systems \u00b1 infrared: stars. 1 I N T R O D U C T I O N Vega-excess, or Vega-like systems are main sequence stars that exhibit infrared emission above expected photospheric levels. The best known Vega-excess stars are a Lyr itself and b Pic. The excess flux is ascribed to thermal emission from circumstellar dust grains orbiting in a disc or ring structure (see e.g. Aumann et al. 1984). Imaging of the dust emission at infrared and submillimetre wavelengths (e.g. Holland et al. 1998; Koerner et al. 1998) and coronagraphic imaging of scattered light (e.g. Smith & Terrile 1984; Schneider et al. 1999) have confirmed that the dust is indeed distributed in discs. Many searches of the IRAS catalogues have found other candidate Vega-like stars (e.g. Aumann 1985; Sadakane & Nishida 1986; Walker & Wolstencroft 1988; Stencel & Backman 1991). The Infrared Space Obsevatory (ISO) has also been used to search for new Vega-likes. One notable result was the discovery of dust emission from r Cnc (Dominik et al. 1998), a G8V star which is known to host at least one planet (Butler et al. 1997). Comprehensive reviews of the Vega-excess phenomenon and its relation to the formation of planets can be found in Backman & Paresce (1993), Ferlet & Vidal-Madjar (1994) and Lagrange, Backman & Artymowicz (2000). 1.1 The new catalogue Mannings & Barlow (1998; henceforth MB) have recently published the results of a new search for candidate Vega-like systems. The search made use of the IRAS Faint Source Survey Catalogue (FSC; see Moshir et al. 1992 for details). The FSC has a sensitivity limit approximately one magnitude fainter than the Point Source Catalog (PSC), achieved by co-adding the individual detector data before extracting sources. The increased sensitivity is gained at the expense of a slight reduction in the reliability of the detections (94 per cent, compared with 99.997 per cent for the PSC). The FSC was searched for main-sequence stars by extracting sources that were positionally associated with luminosity class V stars from the published volumes of the Michigan Catalog of TwoDimensional Spectral Types for the HD Stars (Houk & Cowley 1975; Houk 1978; Houk 1982; Houk & Smith-Moore 1988). Volumes 1\u00b14 of the Michigan catalogue give spectral types and luminosity classes for some 130397 HD stars south of a declination d \u0088 2128. Cross-correlating these catalogues gave a total of 294 luminosity class V stars that have good detections in the IRAS bands 1\u00b1 3, 1 and 2, or 2 and 3 (bands 1, 2, 3 and 4 have wavelengths of 12, 25, 60 and 100mm respectively). Of these, 131 stars were found to show significant IR excess emission. See MB for details of the selection process. q 2000 RAS w E-mail: rjs@star.ucl.ac.uk 74 R. Sylvester and V. Mannings MB searched for excess IR emission on the basis of ratios of the IRAS fluxes, reasoning that a fall-off of flux with wavelength that was shallower than that expected from a stellar photosphere implies excess emission. They therefore did not need to determine the expected (i.e. photospheric) fluxes in the IRAS bands. While this approach provides a robust method for identifying sources with excess emission, detailed analysis of the emitting material requires knowledge of the photospheric contribution to the IR fluxes. We have therefore made optical and near-IR photometric observations of a number of the MB sources, in order to characterize their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at wavelengths where thermal dust emission will be negligible, which allows the photospheric contribution to the SED to be calculated for all wavelengths (typically by using a model atmosphere) and to find the wavelength at which the onset of excess emission occurs. The latter is important for deriving the total excess luminosity, and the maximum temperature of the emitting dust. 2 O B S E RVAT I O N S 26 stars from the MB sample were selected for observing on the basis of their RA and such photometry as was available in the literature. These target stars are listed in Table 1. All the new photometric observations presented here were made in 1995 September, using the facilities of the South African Astronomical Observatory. Spectra in the 10mm band were obtained at UKIRT in 1996 September and 1998 July. 2.1 Optical photometry Photometry was obtained in both the broad-band UBV(RI)C system and in the intermediate-band Stro\u00c8mgren uvby system. Both sets of observations were made using the Modular Photometer on the 0.5-m reflector at the SAAO Sutherland site. See Kilkenny et al. (1998) and Kilkenny & Laing (1992) for details of the use of this instrument, the adopted standard star systems and the data reduction procedures for UBV(RI)C and uvby photometry respectively. An aperture of 25 arcsec was used, and sky background measurements were made for each star that was observed. The data were reduced by SAAO staff, using the photometric reduction procedures described in the latter two references. 2.2 Near-infrared photometry Near-IR (JHKL) observations were made with the MkII Infrared Photometer at the Cassegrain focus of the 0.75-m reflector at Sutherland. The MkII photometer uses an InSb detector cooled by pumped liquid nitrogen, and is of similar design to the MkI instrument described by Glass (1973). Background subtraction is achieved using a sector-wheel chopper in the instrument, with a chopping frequency of 12.5 Hz. The photometer integration time was 10 seconds at a single pointing. The telescope was nodded in declination every 20 s to allow for gradients in the sky emission. An observing `module' consists of two nodded pairs of integrations (on-off-off-on), and therefore lasts 40 seconds. For each target, sufficient modules were taken to attain an adequate signalto-noise ratio in the co-added result. 2.3 Hipparcos/Tycho photometry As well as a wealth of parallax and astrometric data, the Hipparcos mission (ESA 1997) produced a great deal of useful photometric data, for the pre-selected stars in the Hipparcos Input Catalogue, and also for more than a million stars brighter than V , 11:5 (forming the Tycho Catalogue). Stars in the Hipparcos catalogue have photometry in the B, V and I bands, derived from satellite and selected ground-based measurements, while the Tycho catalogue gives B and V magnitudes. Data from the Hipparcos and Tycho catalogues were used to supplement the new ground-based photometry and to check our results. 2.4 Mid-IR spectroscopy Mid-IR spectra were taken on 1998 July 1 of four sources from the MB catalogue: HD 109085, 123356, 150193 and 176363. The data were obtained at UKIRT, using the common-user helium-cooled spectrometer CGS3 in its low-resolution \u0085R < 55\u0086 10mm mode. A detailed description of CGS3 can be found in Cohen & Davies (1995). The spectra were flux calibrated by dividing the spectrum of the target by that of a standard star, then multiplying by a model of the mid-IR spectrum of the standard. a Boo was used to calibrate the HD 109085 spectrum; the model for this standard was the absolutely-calibrated spectrum of Cohen et al. (1995). HD 123356 and HD 150193 were calibrated using s Lib, assumed to radiate as a 3640 K blackbody with a 10.0-mm flux of 188.6 Jy, while HD 176363 was calibrated using h Sgr, treated as a 3600 K blackbody with a 10.0-mm flux of 208.7 Jy. Many of the stars in the MB list are too far south to be observed from UKIRT, so we have not attempted a comprehensive CGS3 survey. Similarly, we do not have SAAO photometry for two of the stars observed with CGS3 due to the different constraints on the two observing runs. The four MB stars observed with CGS3 were selected on criteria including their declination, IRAS 12-mm flux and compatibility with the scheduling of other targets on the observing night. q 2000 RAS, MNRAS 313, 73\u00b186 Table 1.

To better understand how storage transitions from increasing to decreasing system CO2 emissions, we quantify the effect of storage on operational CO2 emissions as a power system decarbonizes under a moderate and strong CO2 emission reduction target through 2045. Under each target, we compare the effect of storage on CO2 emissions when storage participates in only energy, only reserve, and energy and reserve markets. We conduct our study in the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system and use a capacity expansion model to forecast generator fleet changes and a unit commitment and economic dispatch model to quantify system CO2 emissions with and without storage. We find that storage would increase CO2 emissions in the current ERCOT system, but would decrease CO2 emissions in 2025 through 2045 under both decarbonization targets. Storage reduces CO2 emissions primarily by enabling gas-fired generation to displace coal-fired generation, but also by reducing wind and solar curtailment.
