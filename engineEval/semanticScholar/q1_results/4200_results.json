Emission tomography (single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET)) provides a unique tool to investigate functional and neurochemical changes, both in those with established dementia and in those at risk of subsequent cognitive decline. Alzheimer's disease is characterized by bilateral temporoparietal hypoperfusion on SPECT and hypometabolism on PET, which may precede the onset of dementia as similar changes can be demonstrated in those with mild cognitive impairment and in those genetically at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. In dementia with Lewy bodies medial parietal and occipital perfusion deficits are seen together with pre-synaptic and post-synaptic dopaminergic changes, most particularly a reduction in the striatal pre-synaptic dopamine transporter which can be visualized using appropriate ligands (e.g., (123)I-FP-CIT). Vascular dementia is associated with multiple, asymmetric, perfusion deficits in multi-infarct dementia. In contrast, subcortical vascular dementia is associated with reduced perfusion but preserved oxygen extraction fraction on PET. Fronto-temporal dementia is characterized by both hypometabolism and hypoperfusion in fronto-temporal lobes, though hypometabolism appears more extensive, affecting large areas of the cerebral hemispheres. Longitudinal studies of treatment response in Alzheimer's disease with cholinergic drugs have found changes in regional blood flow and nicotinic and muscarinic receptor function in those patients who respond to treatment. Currently, emission tomography is widely used for assisting with clinical differential diagnosis.

Major reductions in the largest emissions sources have made accurate inventories of previously minor sources much more important to the understanding and improvement of local air quality. Changes in manufacturing processes, industry types, vehicle technologies, and metropolitan infrastructure are occurring at an increasingly rapid pace, emphasizing the importance of inventories that reflect current conditions. New technologies for measuring source emissions and ambient pollutant concentrations, both at the point of emissions and from remote platforms, are providing novel approaches to collecting data for inventory developers. Advances in information technologies are allowing data to be shared more quickly, more easily, and processed and compared in novel ways that can speed the development of emission inventories. Approaches to improving quantitative measures of inventory uncertainty allow air quality management decisions to take into account the uncertainties associated with emissions estimates, providing more accurate projections of how well alternative strategies may work. This paper discusses applications of these technologies and techniques to improve the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of emission inventories across North America and outlines a series of eight recommendations aimed at inventory developers and air quality management decision-makers to improve emission inventories and enable them to support effective air quality management decisions for the foreseeable future.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "d935b9ad5451a1282514a0c00b21ee3664ca8515", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2342371998", "CorpusId": 168158150}, "title": "The final policy scenarios of the EU Clean Air Policy Package", "abstract": "Acknowledgements This report was produced under the negotiated procedure to extend contract # Disclaimer The views and opinions expressed in this paper do not necessarily represent the positions of IIASA or its collaborating and supporting organizations.

Executive Summary This report documents the key scenarios that informed the discussion and decision of the college of the European Commission on the Clean Air Policy package. Based on the PRIMES\u20102013 Reference scenario and the associated CAPRI projections of agricultural activities, the GAINS model has been used to explore the potential for environmental improvements offered by emission control measures that are not yet part of current legislation. Compared to the baseline projection in 2025, full application of readily available technical emission reduction measures in the EU could reduce health impacts from PM by another 30% and thereby gain more than 60 million life\u2010years in the EU. It could save another 2,800 premature deaths per year because of lower ozone concentrations. Further controls of agricultural emissions could protect biodiversity at another 200,000 km 2 of ecosystems against excess nitrogen deposition, including 90,000 km 2 of Natura2000 areas and other protected zones. It could eliminate almost all likely exceedances of the air quality limit values for NO 2 , and for PM10 values in the old Member States. It is estimated that the full implementation of all the measures that achieve the above\u2010mentioned benefits would involve in 2025 additional emission control costs of approximately 47 billion \u20ac/yr (0.3% of GDP), compared to 88 billion \u20ac/yr (0.6%) that are spent under current legislation. The report examines interim environmental targets that could serve for 2025 as milestones towards the long\u2010term objective of the EU Environment Action Programme. In a most conservative perspective, considering monetized benefits only for human health and using the low valuation of the value of a lost life year (VOLY), net benefits are maximized at a 76% 'gap closure' between the current legislation baseline and the maximum feasible emission reductions. At this level, emission reduction costs (on top of current legislation) amount to 4.5 billion \u20ac/yr, while benefits from these measures are estimated at 44 billion \u20ac/yr. The European Commission reached a final agreement on a slightly lower gap closure level (70%) for health effects for the new Clean Air Programme for Europe.

The Se(IV) sorption on calcite increased in the presence of sorbed Fe(II) compared to that of Fe-free pure calcite. XANES spectra of Se K-edge shows that nearly half of the total sorbed Se(IV) is reduced to Se(0) by Fe(II) sorbed on calcite within 24 h. The extent of reduction decreases with increasing equilibration time of calcite with Fe(II) solution before Se(IV) addition. The combined results of field emission scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction have shown that needle-shaped red monoclinic elemental Se with diameters of 30-50 nm and lengths of up to 100 nm is precipitated on the calcite surface. Fe(II) coprecipitated calcite does not contribute to Se(IV) reduction within 72 h. Therefore, the reduction capacity of Fe(II) linked to calcite critically depends on its location (either on the surface or in the bulk solid), and less extensively on the pre-equilibration time of calcite with Fe(II) solution.

This omission is troubling because an adaptive emissions-reduction strategy, one that adjusts abatement rates over time based on observations of damages and abatement costs, should perform much better against extreme uncertainty than static, best-estimate policies. However, climate variability can strongly affect the success of adaptive-abatement strategies by masking adverse trends or fooling society into taking too strong an action. This study compares the performance of a wide variety of adaptive greenhouse-gas-abatement strategies against a broad range of plausible future climate-change scenarios. We find that: i) adaptive strategies remain preferable to static, best-estimate policies even with very large levels of climate variability; ii) the most robust strategies are innovation sensitive, that is, adjust future emissions reduction rates on the basis of small changes in observed abatement costs but only for large changes in observed damages; and iii) information about the size of the variability is about a third to an eighth as valuable as information determining the value of the key parameters that represent the long-term, future climate-change state-of-the-world.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "f6d9028b54688ec8c8a0bf47c1bfac777eb06552", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/pieee/UnserA96", "MAG": "1965551074", "DOI": "10.1109/5.488704", "CorpusId": 60911025}, "title": "A review of wavelets in biomedical applications", "abstract": "We present an overview of the various uses of the wavelet transform (WT) in medicine and biology.

Physico-chemical properties of Jatropha biodiesel and its blends with diesel followed by engine performance and emissions characteristics of B10, B20 and B0 were studied. The results show that viscosities of B10 and B20 are closer to diesel. Moreover, only the oxidation stability of B10 and B20 meet the European specifications (EN 590) of 20 h. Therefore, only B10 and B20 have been used to evaluate engine performance and emission. Compared to B0, the average reduction in brake power (BP) is 4.67% for B10 and 8.86% for B20. It was observed that brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) increases as the percentage of biodiesel increase. Compared to B0, a reduction in hydrocarbon (HC) emission of 3.84% and 10.25% and carbon monoxide (CO) emission of 16% and 25% was reported using B10 and B20. However, the blends give higher nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission of 3% and 6% using B10 and B20.

North American leaders recently committed to reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, but information on current emissions from upstream oil and gas developments in Canada are lacking. This study examined the occurrence of methane plumes in an area of unconventional natural gas development in northwestern Canada. In August to September 2015 we completed almost 8000\u202fkm of vehicle-based survey campaigns on public roads dissecting oil and gas infrastructure, such as well pads and processing facilities. We surveyed six routes 3\u20136 times each, which brought us past over 1600 unique well pads and facilities managed by more than 50 different operators. To attribute on-road plumes to oil- and gas-related sources we used gas signatures of residual excess concentrations (anomalies above background) less than 500\u202fm downwind from potential oil and gas emission sources. All results represent emissions greater than our minimum detection limit of 0.59\u202fg\u202fs\u22121 at our average detection distance (319\u202fm). Unlike many other oil and gas developments in the US for which methane measurements have been reported recently, the methane concentrations we measured were close to normal atmospheric levels, except inside natural gas plumes. Roughly 47\u202f% of active wells emitted methane-rich plumes above our minimum detection limit. Multiple sites that pre-date the recent unconventional natural gas development were found to be emitting, and we observed that the majority of these older wells were associated with emissions on all survey repeats. We also observed emissions from gas processing facilities that were highly repeatable. Emission patterns in this area were best explained by infrastructure age and type. Extrapolating our results across all oil and gas infrastructure in the Montney area, we estimate that the emission sources we located (emitting at a rate >\u202f0.59\u202fg\u202fs\u22121) contribute more than 111\u202f800\u202ft of methane annually to the atmosphere. This value exceeds reported bottom-up estimates of 78\u202f000\u202ft of methane for all oil and gas sector sources in British Columbia. Current bottom-up methods for estimating methane emissions do not normally calculate the fraction of emitting oil and gas infrastructure with thorough on-ground measurements. However, this study demonstrates that mobile surveys could provide a more accurate representation of the number of emission sources in an oil and gas development. This study presents the first mobile collection of methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure in British Columbia, and these results can be used to inform policy development in an era of methane emission reduction efforts.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "472805cc80e21ab5488d5c8635203feacdf301af", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2903509943", "DOI": "10.3390/SU10124430", "CorpusId": 85464263}, "title": "Pricing Decisions of CSR Closed-Loop Supply Chains with Carbon Emission Constraints", "abstract": "Global warming has become a growing concern for countries around the world.

Under certain conditions, MDMA can also damage brain dopamine (DA) neurons, at least in rodents. Human MDMA users have been found to have reduced brain 5-HT transporter (SERT) density and cognitive deficits, although it is not known whether these are related. This study sought to determine whether MDMA users who take closely spaced sequential doses, which engender high plasma MDMA concentrations, develop DA transporter (DAT) deficits, in addition to SERT deficits, and whether there is a relationship between transporter binding and cognitive performance.Materials and methodsSixteen abstinent MDMA users with a history of using sequential MDMA doses (two or more doses over a 3- to 12-h period) and 16 age-, gender-, and education-matched controls participated. Subjects underwent positron emission tomography with the DAT and SERT radioligands, [11C]WIN 35,428 and [11C]DASB, respectively. Subjects also underwent formal neuropsychiatric testing.ResultsMDMA users had reductions in SERT binding in multiple brain regions but no reductions in striatal DAT binding. Memory performance in the aggregate subject population was correlated with SERT binding in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and parietal cortex, brain regions implicated in memory function. Prior exposure to MDMA significantly diminished the strength of this relationship.ConclusionsUse of sequential MDMA doses is associated with lasting decreases in brain SERT, but not DAT. Memory performance is associated with SERT binding in brain regions involved in memory function. Prior MDMA exposure appears to disrupt this relationship.

The source attributions for mass concentration, haze formation, transport and direct radiative forcing of black carbon (BC) in various regions of China are quantified in this study using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) with a source-tagging technique. Anthropogenic emissions are from the Community Emissions Data System that is newly developed for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Over north China where the air quality is often poor, about 90\u202f% of near-surface BC concentration is contributed by local emissions. Overall, 35\u202f% of BC concentration over south China in winter can be attributed to emissions from north China, and 19\u202f% comes from sources outside China in spring. For other regions in China, BC is largely contributed from nonlocal sources. We further investigated potential factors that contribute to the poor air quality in China. During polluted days, a net inflow of BC transported from nonlocal source regions associated with anomalous winds plays an important role in increasing local BC concentrations. BC-containing particles emitted from East Asia can also be transported across the Pacific. Our model results show that emissions from inside and outside China are equally important for the BC outflow from East Asia, while emissions from China account for 8\u202f% of BC concentration and 29\u202f% in column burden in the western United States in spring. Radiative forcing estimates show that 65\u202f% of the annual mean BC direct radiative forcing (2.2\u202fW\u202fm\u22122) in China results from local emissions, and the remaining 35\u202f% is contributed by emissions outside of China. Efficiency analysis shows that a reduction in BC emissions over eastern China could have a greater benefit for the regional air quality in China, especially in the winter haze season.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "e1d6e369fcfc08c0c671aedc9be868809c7c11fb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2076750874", "DOI": "10.1086/133792", "CorpusId": 122930660}, "title": "SOUTH POLE OBSERVATIONS OF THE NEAR-INFRARED SKY BRIGHTNESS", "abstract": "To observe the faintest objects in the Universe astronomers require the darkest skies.

The band-spread slurry application technologies of trailing hose and trailing shoe have been shown to reduce NH3 emissions and consequently to increase plant uptake of slurry-applied N. There is a need to improve the precision in calculating the reduction in NH3 emission nationally and at farm level, and this may be achieved through the development of algorithms that more accurately estimate NH3 emission and also support the assessment of fertilizer efficiency of slurry that is band-applied to crops. Therefore, this study reviewed studies of NH3 emission from slurry band applied with a trailing hose or shoe with the objective of developing an algorithm for calculating the reduction efficiency of the band application technique in relation to crop height. The developed algorithm predicted that for slurry applications to cereal crops, the reduction efficiency would increase by slightly less than 1% for every 1 cm increase in crop height. For slurry application to grassland, the reduction efficiency was predicted to increase by approximately 5% for every 1 cm increase in sward height. The developed algorithm was used in combination with the ALFAM model, which predicts NH3 emission from slurry applications to bare soil, to provide monthly coefficients for estimating NH3 emission from slurry applied to bare soil, cereal crops and grassland for Denmark and Southern England. Inclusion of the crop height algorithm in the emission factor derivation predicted, for example, a decrease in the emission factor for cattle slurry application by trailing hose to winter wheat from c. 25% to c. 15% of applied ammoniacal N for applications in January and May, respectively. While the algorithm developed in this study would benefit from wider validation, should more published data become available, the present paper demonstrates its potential value as an educational tool for farmers and advisers in developing more sustainable manure management strategies and for inclusion in emission factor calculations for national inventories to both improve the temporal distribution of emissions from slurry application and to better reflect improved management practices of farmers.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "2e32f54108a772f6ebd3341e8c15fd027d32bf8e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2973021426", "CorpusId": 5032310}, "title": "Technology Roadmap Energy and GHG Reductions in the Chemical Industry via Catalytic Processes", "abstract": "The International Energy Agency (IEA), an autonomous agency, was established in November 1974.

New evidence, using increasingly sophisticated methodologies, has become available in the last several years, allowing more accurate assessment of exposure and resultant associations with specific types of PM, or PM derived from different sources. Such new studies may also allow differentiation of effects from different chemical components in the same study against the same health endpoints. This article considers whether this new evidence might be adequate to allow us to \u201cspeciate\u201d PM types or sources by severity of health effects. We address this issue with respect to two widespread sources of PM, emissions from motor vehicles and coal-fired power plants. Emissions from less widespread sources, residual oil and steel/coking facilities, are also discussed in order to illustrate how health effects associated with such emissions might instead be associated with more widespread sources when accurate exposure information is unavailable. Based upon evaluation of studies and methodologies which appear to contain the most accurate information on exposure and response to important emissions, including variable local emissions, it is concluded that public health will likely be better protected by reduction of various vehicular emissions than by continued regulation of the total mass of fine PM (PM <2.5 \u03bc m, or PM2.5) as if all PM in this mode is equitoxic.

Our simulation including a global mercury source of 7000 Mg yr\u22121 and a TGM lifetime of 0.8 years reproduces the magnitude and large-scale variability of TGM observations at land sites. However, it cannot capture observations of high TGM from ship cruises, implying a problem either in the measurements or in our fundamental understanding of mercury sources. Observed TGM seasonal variation at northern midlatitudes is consistent with a photochemical oxidation for Hg(0) partly balanced by photochemical reduction of Hg(II). Observations of increasing RGM with altitude imply a long lifetime of Hg(II) in the free troposphere. We find in the model that Hg(II) dominates over Hg(0) in the upper troposphere and stratosphere and that subsidence is the principal source of Hg(II) at remote surface sites. RGM observations at Okinawa Island (Japan) show large diurnal variability implying fast deposition, which we propose is due to RGM uptake by sea-salt aerosols. Observed mercury wet deposition fluxes in the United States show a maximum in the southeast, which we attribute to photochemical oxidation of the global Hg(0) pool. They also show a secondary maximum in the industrial Midwest due to regional emissions that is underestimated in the model, possibly because of excessive dry deposition relative to wet (dry deposition accounts for 68% of total mercury deposition in the United States in the model, but this is sensitive to the assumed phase of Hg(II)).

However, compared with other work performed on 1994- to 2004-technology engines, average emission reductions in the range of 71\u201399% were observed for a very comprehensive list of unregulated engine exhaust pollutants and air toxic contaminants that included metals and other elements, elemental carbon (EC), inorganic ions, and gas- and particle-phase volatile and semi-volatile organic carbon (OC) compounds. The low PM mass emitted from the 2007 technology ACES engines was composed mainly of sulfate (53%) and OC (30%), with a small fraction of EC (13%) and metals and other elements (4%). The fraction of EC is expected to remain small, regardless of engine operation, because of the presence of the high-efficiency C-DPF in the exhaust. This is different from typical PM composition of pre-2007 engines with EC in the range of 10\u201390%, depending on engine operation. Most of the particles emitted from the 2007 engines were mainly volatile nuclei mode in the sub-30-nm size range. An increase in volatile nanoparticles was observed during C-DPF active regeneration, during which the observed particle number was similar to that observed in emissions of pre-2007 engines. However, on average, when combining engine operation with and without active regeneration events, particle number emissions with the 2007 engines were 90% lower than the particle number emitted from a 2004-technology engine tested in an earlier program. IMPLICATIONS To meet the 2007 EPA heavy-duty highway PM emissions standard, engine manufacturers have elected to equip engine exhaust with a high-efficiency C-DPF. Because of the use of the C-DPF, the PM emissions were 86% below the 2007 standard, and many unregulated gas and particle-phase emissions compounds were substantially lower than those emitted from pre-2007-technology engines. Signifi-cant air quality benefits can be expected as the C-DPF technology, or other equivalent technology, continues to be applied to future highway engines and to other nonroad and stationary diesel engines.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "28c684dd2712390d731286fbc7a3f8d616d064e0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2077767624", "DOI": "10.1038/385634A0", "CorpusId": 4264272, "PubMed": "9024661"}, "title": "Decreased prefrontal dopamine D1 receptors in schizophrenia revealed by PET", "abstract": "Schizophrenia is believed to involve altered activation of dopamine receptors, and support for this hypothesis conies from the antipsychotic effect of antagonists of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R)1.

CO2 capture is premised on the safe long-term storage of CO2 in geological formations. Naturally occurring CO2 is used for enhanced oil recovery in the USA, Trinidad, Turkey, Hungary, Brazil and Croatia. Industrially produced CO2 has been used for enhanced oil recovery at the Rangely field in Colorado, USA since 1986 and at the Weyburn field in Saskatchewan, Canada since 2000. Large-scale CO2 storage in geological formations to avoid CO2 emissions was first undertaken offshore in Norway in 1996 and onshore in Algeria in 2004. CO2 delivered for EOR in the USA averaged around USD 11/tonne CO2 during the 1990s. The cost of CO2 capture from low concentration industrial sources varies with a number of factors, but will certainly be very much higher than the recovery of naturally\u2013occurring CO2. Adequate knowledge exists in the oil and gas industry for the application of CO2 capture and storage. Widespread implementation of fully-integrated CO2 value chains will nonetheless depend on achieving public acceptance and regulatory approval for CO2 storage, cost reduction for CO2 capture and sufficient economic incentives for the key actors involved. This article discusses the most important research directions for CO2 capture and storage projects that have been initiated around the world.

Electron Emission Spectroscopy Characterization of N-doped Diamond and Si-doped AlGaN. (Under the direction of Dr. Robert J. Nemanich.) Semiconductors with negative electron affinity provide an alternative way to achieve low work function materials because the Fermi level could be increased in the band gap by the process and doping engineering, while the surface termination will maintain the vacuum level below the conduction band minimum. Thermionic emission and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) were employed to determine the temperature dependent electron emission energy distribution from nitrogen doped diamond films prepared by microwave plasma chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The photoemission spectra obtained at room temperature indicated a work function of 1.8eV and a negative electron affinity (NEA). The thermionic emission and photoemission spectra obtained at 380\u00b0C indicated a minimum kinetic energy of 1.5eV relative to the Fermi level. Both spectra displayed the same sharp cutoff corresponding to the conduction band minimum (CBM). The temperature dependence of the Fermi energy and the surface band bending were modeled to account for the work function reduction with increased temperature. The increased binding energy of the VBM (3.7eV) and the C1s core level (286.6eV) were indications of the increase of the Fermi level within the bandgap. The difference of surface band bending for the CVD diamond in comparison with results for natural single diamond was discussed regarding the donor and acceptor surface state. A band diagram was proposed to describe the electron transport and thermionic emission process for the N-doped diamond thin film structure. The coupling of the sp2 and sp3 bonded carbon appears to play an important role in the electron transport. The thermionic emission properties of both Dysprosium and N-doped CVD diamond with a negative electron affinity (NEA) were investigated with thermionic emission spectroscopy (TES). At a temperature of 370oC thermionic emission from N-doped diamond was observed with a minimum kinetic energy of 2.5eV relative to the Fermi level, while thermionic emission from Dy was detected until temperature above 560OC with 2.5eV work Function. The different thermionic emission properties between N-doped diamond and Dy were attributed to the negative electron affinity (NEA) on diamond surface. Fitting results showed thermionic emission from Dy follows the traditional Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution while the thermionic emission CVD diamond is more close to the half-Maxwellian distribution. N-polar and Al (Ga)-polar AlGaN films were grown on C-polar and Si-polar SiC substrates, respectively. Atomic Force Microscopy images of the surfaces after KOH etching verified the N-polar face which is highly reactive and showed etch pits while the Al-face was resistant to KOH etching. Combined XPS and UPS characterization have shown that both N-polar and Al-polar surfaces of AlN have a zero or negative electron affinity. Furthermore, it has been determined that the N-face AlN has a lower work function (2.5eV) than the Al-face AlN (3.0 eV). The difference is attributed to the spontaneous polarization field. The results for the AlGaN alloy surfaces indicate that as the Al concentration is increased, the electron affinity and work function decreases.

As such, this paper studied the effects of nitrate and nitrite ions on mercury re-emission and its related mechanism. Experimental results revealed that the nitrate ions had neglected effect on mercury re-emission while the nitrite ions could greatly change the mercury re-emission behaviors. The nitrite ions could initially improve the Hg(0)-emission through the decomposition of HgSO3NO2(-), but with a further increase in the concentration, they would then inhibit the reduction of bivalent mercury owing to the formation of Hg-nitrite complex [Hg(NO2)x(2-x)].

Methods We used models that simulate global atmospheric chemistry (GEOS-Chem); the fate, transport, and bioaccumulation of mercury in four types of freshwater ecosystems; and mercury cycling among different ocean basins. We considered effects on mercury exposures in the U.S. population based on dietary survey information and consumption data from the sale of commercial market fish. Results Although North American emissions controls may reduce mercury exposure by up to 50% for certain highly exposed groups such as indigenous peoples in the Northeast, the potential effects of emissions controls on populations consuming marine fish from the commercial market are less certain because of limited measurements.

In an earlier study, we demonstrated a reduction in the equivalent width of low-ionization absorption lines in composite spectra of Lyman break galaxies at z \u2243 4 compared to similar measures at z \u2243 3. This might imply a lower covering fraction of neutral gas and hence an increase with redshift in the escape fraction of ionizing photons. However, our spectral resolution was inadequate to differentiate between several alternative explanations, including changes with redshift in the outflow kinematics. Here we present higher quality spectra of three gravitationally lensed Lyman break galaxies at z \u2243 4 with a spectral resolution sufficient to break this degeneracy of interpretation. We present a method for deriving the covering fraction of low-ionization gas as a function of outflow velocity and compare the results with similar quality data taken for galaxies at lower redshift. We find an interesting but tentative trend of lower covering fractions of low-ionization gas for galaxies with strong Ly\u03b1 emission.

The fluorescence parameter, \u0394F/Fm, showed that the allocation of photosynthetic electrons to O2 was increased during the desiccation of a leaf. Decreasing leaf net CO2 uptake, either by decreasing the ambient CO2 concentration or by dehydrating a leaf, had the same effect on the partitioning of photosynthetic electrons between CO2 and O2 reduction. It is concluded that the decline of net CO2 uptake of a leaf under drought stress is only due, at least for a mild reversible stress (causing at most a leaf water deficit of 35%), to stomatal closure which leads to a decrease in leaf internal CO2 concentration. Since, during the dehydration of a leaf, the calculated internal CO2 concentration remained constant or even increased we conclude that this calculation is misleading under such conditions.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "4bb8c63e9d2bfd094624a741888eff555cf3d8a1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2113285975", "CorpusId": 15609038}, "title": "Analysis and Reduction of Radiated EMI of Power Modules", "abstract": "The presented paper introduces a novel type of EMI optimised, balanced power modules with reduced EMI in the frequency range for radiated emissions from 30 MHz to 300 MHz. The comparison of the novel modules to a conventional module layout with same semiconductor chips shows a noise reduction up to 30 dB in the critical frequency region around 30 MHz. For frequencies above 50 MHz the noise reduction is 15 dB to 20 dB. In the frequency range from 30 MHz to 300 MHz the emission is strongly influenced by the module layout in addition to the semiconductor behaviour. Two basic noise sources have to be taken into account. First, stray inductances between DC-Link and power stage create together with semiconductor capacitances differential mode oscillations. Second, the permanent voltage change at the output node drives noise currents through the stray capacitances of the output and of the gates to power ground. The investigations shows that the output capacitances of the module can be minimized by using flip chip technology for the low side IGBT\u00bfs. The gate-stray capacitances can be minimized by layout measures as well. Additionally, an unbalanced layout of the DC-Bus bar promotes the spreading of the noise created by DC-Link oscillations.

The data consisted of daily, 24-hr time resolution measurements from the Aerosol Research Inhalation Epidemiology Study (ARIES) Jefferson Street (Atlanta) site and five other sites of the Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization Project (SEARCH). Reductions of total NH3 (gas-phase NH3 plus particulate NH4 +), total NO3 \u2212 (HNO3 plus particulate NO3 \u2212), SO4 2\u2212, or combined total NO3 \u2212 (HNO3 plus particulate NO3 \u2212) with SO4 2\u2212 were used to estimate the effects of changing emission levels.

For all sites, fine particulate NO3 \u2212 concentrations decreased in response to reductions of either NH3 or total NO3 \u2212, but the particulate NO3 \u2212 decreases were greater for the NH3 reductions than for the total NO3 \u2212 reductions.

Since the first oil crises of 1973 have been reductions in emissions per passenger-km or tonne-km of key modes, driven both by changes in technology and changes in the utilization and operation of vehicles. There was no significant change in the amount of CO2 per unit of fuel consumed. In the same time frame, overall transport activity rose and that of the most energy and carbon intensive modes, cars, trucks, and aircraft, rose the most quickly. Shifts to these modes offset some of the savings in fuel and carbon from improvements in each mode; indeed shifts to trucking almost offset the impacts of reduced CO2 emissions per tonne-km of each mode in freight.

They account for a large share of manure-related N(2)O emissions, as well as soil-related N(2)O emissions through the use of grazing land, and land for feed and forage production. It is widely acknowledged that mitigation measures are necessary to avoid an increase in N(2)O emissions while meeting the growing global food demand. The production and emissions of N(2)O are closely linked to the efficiency of nitrogen (N) transfer between the major components of a livestock system, that is, animal, manure, soil and crop. Therefore, mitigation options in this paper have been structured along these N pathways. Mitigation technologies involving diet-based intervention include lowering the CP content or increasing the condensed tannin content of the diet. Animal-related mitigation options also include breeding for improved N conversion and high animal productivity. The main soil-based mitigation measures include efficient use of fertilizer and manure, including the use of nitrification inhibitors. In pasture-based systems with animal housing facilities, reducing grazing time is an effective option to reduce N(2)O losses. Crop-based options comprise breeding efforts for increased N-use efficiency and the use of pastures with N(2)-fixing clover. It is important to recognize that all N(2)O mitigation options affect the N and carbon cycles of livestock systems. Therefore, care should be taken that reductions in N(2)O emissions are not offset by unwanted increases in ammonia, methane or carbon dioxide emissions.

While several test methods have been developed to assess a material's potential for early-age shrinkage cracking, this paper describes the use of the \u2018ring-test\u2019 for assessing the performance of a fiber reinforced concrete. An equation is presented that enables the residual stress that develops in the concrete ring specimen to be estimated. This expression is used to approximate the stress that is transferred across a crack. It is shown that for conventional fiber reinforced concrete (i.e., the mixtures described in this paper) the pre-peak mechanical properties (elastic modulus, splitting tensile strength and free shrinkage) are not influenced greatly by the addition of fibers. Rather, fibers appear to influence shrinkage-cracking behavior only after the crack begins to open. To better understand the role of fibers in mitigating early-age shrinkage cracking passive acoustic emission testing was used. Acoustic emission measurements indicate microcracking due to the heterogenous nature of the concrete and the presence of moisture gradients. The acoustic emission results highlight how a single crack begins to form into a visible crack. Finally, an approach is presented for estimating crack-width based on the strain data measured from the ring test.

Before correction, the AD group had significantly lower cortex-to-cerebellum ratios in the posterior temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes in comparison to the control subjects. Partial volume correction of PET data resulted in 19 to 49% increases in regional activity in the AD group and 16 to 38% increases in the control group. The patients' persistence of significant hypometabolism in the frontal, posterior temporal, and parietal regions after partial volume correction suggests that a true reduction in regional cerebral glucose metabolism occurs in AD, even though its magnitude is a result of both metabolic reductions and the effects of atrophy. Partial volume correction of PET data in the AD group had a significant impact on the correlations between regional glucose metabolism and neuropsychological performance. These findings suggest that accounting for differential extent and distribution of cerebral atrophy in patients with AD and in healthy individuals may potentially improve our ability to interpret specific cognitive dysfunction in the context of the functional imaging data.

Ultrafast imaging relies on the coherent compounding of backscattered echoes resulting from successive tilted plane waves emissions; this produces high-resolution ultrasound images with a trade-off between final frame rate, contrast and resolution. In this work, we introduce multiplane wave imaging, a new method that strongly improves ultrafast images signal-to-noise ratio by virtually increasing the emission signal amplitude without compromising the frame rate. This method relies on the successive transmissions of multiple plane waves with differently coded amplitudes and emission angles in a single transmit event. Data from each single plane wave of increased amplitude can then be obtained, by recombining the received data of successive events with the proper coefficients.

This thesis investigates the possibility of reducing fuel burn and emissions from surface operations through a reduction of the taxi times of departing aircraft. Data analysis of the departing traffic in four major US airports provides a comprehensive assessment of the impact of surface congestion on taxi times, fuel burn and emissions. For this analysis two metrics are introduced: one that compares the taxi times to the unimpeded ones and another that evaluates them in terms of their contribution to the airport's throughput. A novel approach is proposed that models the aircraft departure process as a queuing system. The departure taxi (taxi-out) time of an aircraft is represented as a sum of three components: the unimpeded taxi-out time, the time spent in the departure queue, and the congestion delay due to ramp and taxiway interactions. The dependence of the taxi-out time on these factors is analyzed and modeled. The performance of the model is validated through a comparison of its predictions with observed data at Boston's Logan International Airport (BOS). A reduction in taxi times may be achieved through the queue management strategy known as N-Control, which controls the pushback process so as to keep the number of departing aircraft on the surface of the airport below a specified threshold. The developed model is used to quantify the impact of N-Control on taxi times, delays, fuel burn and emissions at BOS. Finally, the benefits and implications of N-Control are compared to the ones theoretically achievable from a scheme that controls the takeoff queue of each departing aircraft.

Previous work showed that red and blue/green emitting species form with the cytosine oligonucleotide dC12. To understand how the bases and base sequence influence cluster formation, the blue/green emitting clusters that form with the thymine-containing oligonucleotides dT12, dT4C4T4, and dC4T4C4 are discussed. With dT12 and dT4C4T4, variations in the solution pH establish that the clusters associate with the N3 of thymine. The small clusters are bound to the larger DNA template, as demonstrated by fluorescence anisotropy, circular dichroism, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) studies. For dT4C4T4, FCS studies showed that approximately 50% of the strands are labeled with the fluorescent clusters. Absorption spectra and the gas dependence of the fluorescence show that nonfluorescent clusters also form following the reduction of the silver cation - oligonucleotide conjugates. Fluorescent cluster formation is favored by oxygen, thus indicating that the DNA-bound clusters are partially oxidized. To elaborate the sequence dependence of cluster formation, dC4T4C4 was studied. Cluster formation depends on the oligonucleotide concentration, and higher concentrations favor a red emitting species. A blue/green emissive species dominates at lower concentrations of dC4T4C4, and it has spectroscopic, physical, and chemical properties that are similar to those of the clusters that form with dT12 and dT4C4T4. These results suggest that cytosine- and thymine-containing oligonucleotides stabilize a preferred emissive silver cluster.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "dde74cf82ff57ae13d7e6a6305c3fed842b395a5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "612184503", "CorpusId": 106662878}, "title": "Nitrogen Oxides Control Technology Fact Book", "abstract": "This title describes international technologies for controlling NOx emissions, primarily from coal combustion.

First, environmental burden reduction involves green process and engineering, emissions control, desulfurization/denitrification of nonrenewable energy sources, and improvement of agriculture and food systems. Second, reduction/treatment of industrial and agricultural wastes involves converting wastes into products, groundwater remediation, adsorption, delaying photocatalysis, and nanomembranes. Third, NPS pollution control involves controlling water pollution. Nanomaterials alter physical properties on a nanoscale due to their high specific surface area to volume ratio. They are used as catalysts, adsorbents, membranes, and additives to increase activity and capability due to their high specific surface areas and nano-sized effects. Thus, nanomaterials are more effective at treating environmental wastes because they reduce the amount of material needed.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "88e9bdfcf25b58d6d52709342ce62518fe63215a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2796250434", "DOI": "10.1029/2006WR005206", "CorpusId": 129071934}, "title": "Coupling between geochemical reactions and multicomponent gas and solute transport in unsaturated media: A reactive transport modeling study", "abstract": "The two\u2010way coupling that exists between biogeochemical reactions and vadose zone transport processes, in particular gas phase transport, determines the composition of soil gas. To explore these feedback processes quantitatively, multicomponent gas diffusion and advection are implemented into an existing reactive transport model that includes a full suite of geochemical reactions. Multicomponent gas diffusion is described on the basis of the dusty gas model, which accounts for all relevant gas diffusion mechanisms. The simulation of gas attenuation in partially saturated landfill soil covers, methane production, and oxidation in aquifers contaminated by organic compounds (e.g., an oil spill site) and pyrite oxidation in mine tailings demonstrate that both diffusive and advective gas transport can be affected by geochemical reactions. Methane oxidation in landfill covers reduces the existing upward pressure gradient, thereby decreasing the contribution of advective methane emissions to the atmosphere and enhancing the net flux of atmospheric oxygen into the soil column. At an oil spill site, methane oxidation causes a reversal in the direction of gas advection, which results in advective transport toward the zone of oxidation both from the ground surface and the deeper zone of methane production. Both diffusion and advection contribute to supply atmospheric oxygen into the subsurface, and methane emissions to the atmosphere are averted. During pyrite oxidation in mine tailings, pressure reduction in the reaction zone drives advective gas flow into the sediment column, enhancing the oxidation process. In carbonate\u2010rich mine tailings, calcite dissolution releases carbon dioxide, which partly offsets the pressure reduction caused by O2 consumption.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "296126c7a56953db71bc14e7d9e95038bec8dde3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2084729364", "DOI": "10.1039/AN9901500167", "CorpusId": 98017145}, "title": "Interference by mineral acids in inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry", "abstract": "Interferences caused by low concentrations of mineral acids have been investigated in inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry.

The former was predominant at lower concentrations of mineral acids (\u2a7d1 M) and the latter became influential at higher acid concentrations (1 M). The excitation temperature was found to decrease in the presence of mineral acids. The decreases in emission intensities were in fair agreement with those estimated from the decreases in excitation temperature.", "year": 1990}]}
