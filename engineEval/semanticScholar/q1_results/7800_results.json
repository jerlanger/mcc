The Doppler-broadened line profiles provide information about the velocity distribution of the hot plasma, while the wavelengthdependent attenuation across a line profile provides information about the absorption to the hot plasma, thus providing a strong constraint on its physical location. In this paper, we apply several analysis techniques to the emission lines in the Chandra High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer (HETGS) spectrum of the late-O supergiant \u03b6 Ori (O9.7 Ib), including the fitting of a simple line-profile model. We show that there is distinct evidence for blueshifts and profile asymmetry, as well as broadening in the X-ray emission lines of \u03b6 Ori. These are the observational hallmarks of a wind-shock X-ray source, and the results for \u03b6 Ori are very similar to those for the earlier O star, \u03b6 Pup, which we have previously shown to be well fit by the same wind-shock line-profile model. The more subtle effects on the line-profile morphologies in \u03b6 Ori, as compared to \u03b6 Pup, are consistent with the somewhat lower density wind in this later O supergiant. In both stars, the wind optical depths required to explain the mildly asymmetric X-ray line profiles imply reductions in the effective opacity of nearly an order of magnitude, which may be explained by some combination of mass-loss rate reduction and large-scale clumping, with its associated porosity-based effects on radiation transfer. In the context of the recent reanalysis of the helium-like line intensity ratios in both \u03b6 Ori and \u03b6 Pup, and also in light of recent work questioning the published mass-loss rates in OB stars, these new results indicate that the X-ray emission from \u03b6 Ori can be understood within the framework of the standard wind-shock scenario for hot stars.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "fb76765ec734ea84696ebb6bce9fdc30bdec0149", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2278660109", "DOI": "10.1086/682572", "CorpusId": 130502113}, "title": "Climate Campaigns, Cap and Trade, and Carbon Leakage: Why Trying to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint Can Harm the Climate", "abstract": "Governments and environmental NGOs campaign for carbon footprint reductions by households.

The results indicated that improving ADHD symptom after methylphenidate is associated with normalization of abnormally reduced orbitofrontal activity and abnormally increased somatosensory cortical activity.

The flame volume was found to increase with increase in air-preheat temperature and decrease in oxygen concentration. The flame length showed a similar behavior. The concentrations ofOH, CH, and C 2 increased with an increase in air preheat temperatures. These species exhibited a two-stage combustion behavior at low-oxygen concentration and single-stage combustion behavior at high-oxygen concentration in the air. Stable flames were obtained for remarkably low equivalence ratios, which would not be possible with normal combustion air.

No fundamentally new insights and fundamentally new techniques have emerged over the last decade. \n\nHowever, in the last 10 years, the known techniques have been applied at a much larger scale in an increasing number of countries, the practical functioning of these techniques has improved, and costs have declined through learning effects. In several countries specialized contractors have taken over some of the activities (e.g., low-emission manure application), which has substantially reduced costs. \n\nFor the major sources of agricultural ammonia emissions (i.e., animal manure and urea fertilizer application), a range of emission control options is now proven in practice in more and more countries. Many of these measures are cost-effective, especially when additional synergistic effects are considered. \n\nModified animal feeding, covered slurry storages, low-emission manure and urea fertilizer application techniques are now cost-effective means in many situations. In particular, modified animal feeding can decrease NH3 emissions from all stages of the animal manure management chain, and, at the same time, decrease N2O emissions and odour. \n\nEmission reduction efficiencies and costs of these measures are sensitive against chosen reference system and depend on local factors, such as weather and soil conditions, differences in management practices and in the technical performances of abatement measures. Yet, in many countries, there is only limited experience with low-emissions techniques, due to technical, economical and cultural barriers that prohibit their implementation. Information and experience gained in other countries is often not readily accepted by farmers. However, in several cases technological and institutional experience has been successfully transferred between countries, resulting in lower costs than originally anticipated. \n\nWhile cost estimates of low-emission techniques remain uncertain for specific farms due to the inherent variability of important factors across farms, costs tend to be higher on small farms in countries with little experience, and lower on large farms in countries with lots of experience. \n\nThe report suggests concrete steps to incorporate these new developments into the GAINS integrated assessment model through modified definitions of mitigation options, adjusted data on emission removal efficiencies and applicabilities, and emission control costs.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "50de1a80ed5afcc01444c2f9f7f120b10d66aaa7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2227688558", "DOI": "10.4271/2004-01-1882", "CorpusId": 102265192}, "title": "Hydrocarbons and Aldehydes from a Diesel Engine Running on Ethanol and Equipped With EGR, Catalyst and DPF", "abstract": "A commercially available exhaust aftertreatment system, DNO\\dx\\sT, comprising exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), an oxidative catalyst and a continuously regenerating diesel particulate filter (DPF) were tested. The test object was a 9-liter, ethanol-fueled diesel engine from Scania equipped with turbocharger and aftercooler. A similar diesel engine from Scania, but running on ordinary Swedish diesel fuel, was used as a reference and a reminder of \"the state of the art.\" The tests involved two different ethanol fuels containing various ignition improvers, Beraid 3540 and rapeseed methyl ester. Test conditions for the engines were those specified in the European Stationary Cycle (ESC). The aftertreatment system reduced the emissions of HC, CO and NO\\dx, down to 0.15, 0.04 and 2.54 g/kWh, respectively, while the estimated particle mass was reduced by 67%. Actually, by using the DNO\\dx\\sT system, the engines became Euro IV engines regarding the emissions of HC, CO and NO\\dx. The ethanol-fueled engine without EGR, catalyst or DPF emitted approximately 1.6 times more formaldehyde and 9.8 times more acetaldehyde than the diesel engine. However, the emission of acrolein was only 0.47 times the emission of acrolein from the diesel engine. When the ethanol-fueled engine was equipped with DNO\\dx\\sT, a significant reduction of the emissions of aldehydes was obtained. The emissions of acrolein, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde were reduced by 56%, 87% and 95%, respectively. An even higher reduction was observed when the system was connected to the diesel engine. Fifteen different hydrocarbons (alkanes, olefins and monoaromates) were also identified. The diesel-fueled engine, without any exhaust aftertreatment devices, emitted approximately twice as much hydrocarbon than the ethanol-fueled engine, also without any exhaust aftertreatment devices. However, there were also qualitative differences. Three hydrocarbons, namely propene, ethene and benzene, accounted for 77% of the hydrocarbons emitted from the diesel-fueled engine, while acetylene, ethene and benzene, made up only 53% of the hydrocarbons emitted from the ethanol-fueled engine. When connecting the system to the engines, a difference was observed; the reduction of analyzed hydrocarbon emissions was approximately 90% for the diesel-fueled engine, but only 47% for the ethanol-fueled engine. The studied aftertreatment system has been developed and optimized for the diesel-fueled engine. This fact is reflected in the powerful reduction of hydrocarbons, aldehydes, particles and NO\\dx that is obtained when connecting the system to the diesel-fueled engine. Nevertheless, a significant reduction is also obtained when connecting the system to the ethanol-fueled engine. Test results indicate that it should be possible to better optimize the system for the ethanol engine. It is also, probably, necessary to exchange the catalyst in the system.

The Kyoto Protocol entered into force on 16 February 2005, available at http://unfccc.int/ resource/docs/convkp/kpeng.pdf. Since the creation of the first World Bank carbon fund over seven years ago, the World Bank carbon business has undergone a number of innovations. In July of 1999, the Executive Directors of the World Bank2 approved the establishment of a Prototype Carbon Fund (PCF)3 to promote buying carbon emission reductions in developing countries and countries with economies in transition. This came after years of analytical work4 framed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)5. The PCF has, in many respects, been the pioneer of the global carbon market, piloting transactions several years before the Kyoto Protocol to the UNFCCC entered into effect6 and acting as a \u2018role model\u2019 for other similar funds that have been launched by the World Bank itself (Carbon Funds), other international financial institutions and the private sector. The basic concept of the PCF was simple. It collected contributions from both public and private sector entities and used those funds to facilitate projects that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The emission reductions so generated are then distributed to the entities that contributed to the fund pro rata based on the amount of their respective contributions.7 The basic concept was fully endorsed by the 17 private entities and six governments that contributed US$180 million to the PCF. Soon after the PCF became operational in 2000, it entered into its first emissions reductions purchase agreement (ERPA). To date the PCF has identified, on behalf of the fund participants, emission reducing projects ranging from biomass and small hydro to energy efficiency and conservation in over 15 countries. In the World Bank, over the past seven years, carbon finance has grown from the PCF to include 10 Carbon Funds,8 with a total capitalization of approximately US$2 billion.9 The Carbon Funds largely focus on compliance interests in the first commitment period (2008\u20132012) established by the Kyoto Protocol. However, in addition to focusing on compliance obligations, the World Bank has created the Community Development Carbon Fund to allow countries in the poorest regions of the world to benefit from opportunities created by carbon markets, by delivering demonstrable additional sustainable development benefits in addition to emission reductions. Similarly, the World Bank established the BioCarbon Fund to demonstrate opportunities in biological carbon sequestration, and the BioCarbon Fund is still the pre-eminent buyer of assets from land-use and forestry projects worldwide. Additionally, the World Bank has expanded the market beyond generating emission reductions under the current limits of the Kyoto Protocol, including through purchases of emission reductions that are generated post 2012.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "b624ba4eb33fc8d5fa69c78c79805cac81fc0692", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2476484941", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.6b02479", "CorpusId": 20068201, "PubMed": "27501388"}, "title": "Detailed Observation of Multiphoton Emission Enhancement from a Single Colloidal Quantum Dot Using a Silver-Coated AFM Tip.", "abstract": "The enhancement of multiphoton emission from a single colloidal nanocrystal quantum dot (NQD) interacting with a plasmonic nanostructure was investigated using a silver-coated atomic force microscopy tip (AgTip) as the plasmonic nanostructure. Using the AgTip, which exhibited a well-defined localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonance band, we controlled the spectral overlap and the distance between the single NQD and the AgTip. The emission behavior of the single NQD when approaching the AgTip at the nanometer scale was measured using off-resonance (405 nm) and resonance (465 nm) excitation of the LSP. We directly observed the conversion of the single-photon emission from a single NQD to multiphoton emission with reduction of the emission lifetime at both excitation wavelengths as the NQD-AgTip distance decreased, whereas a decrease and increase in the emission intensity were observed at 405 and 465 nm excitation, respectively. By combining theoretical analysis and the numerical simulation of the AgTip, we deduced that the enhancement of the multiphoton emission was caused by the quenching of the single-exciton state due to the energy transfer from the NQD to the AgTip and that the emission intensity was increased by enhancement of the excitation rate due to the electric field of the LSP on the AgTip.

Reduction of cropland CH4 and N2O emissions is expected to mitigate climate change. However, large uncertainty remains in the assessment and prediction of these emissions, which prevents us from establishing appropriate mitigation options and strategies. The uncertainty is attributed mainly to the high spatiotemporal variability in emissions (e.g., emission spikes of N2O). Understanding and quantifying how hotspots of CH4 and N2O production in soil and then hot moments of their emissions occur would help reduce the uncertainty. This review focuses on soil\u2013plant systems, particularly the rhizosphere, as possible hotspots of production and consumption of CH4 and N2O. It is well known that the rhizosphere controls CH4 emission strongly, though each process of production and consumption remains to be quantified. On the other hand, surprisingly little attention has been paid to N2O, besides the fact that plant roots strongly control nitrification and denitrification. We review the current knowledge of cropland CH4 and N2O emissions, and conclude that soil\u2013plant interactions strongly affect cropland emissions of both gases, in which functions of plant roots affecting biogeochemical factors (e.g., availability of oxygen, labile organic carbon and inorganic nitrogen) in the rhizosphere and phenological changes are particularly important.

With emerging access to high quality data, new methods are needed for informing transportation emissions assessment practitioners of the relevant vehicle and infrastructure characteristics that should be prioritized in modeling to improve the accuracy of inventories. The sensitivity of light and heavy-duty vehicle greenhouse gas (GHG) and conventional air pollutant (CAP) emissions to speed, weight, age, and roadway gradient are examined with second-by-second velocity profiles on freeway and arterial roads under free-flow and congestion scenarios. By creating upper and lower bounds for each factor, the potential variability which could exist in transportation emissions assessments is estimated. When comparing the effects of changes in these characteristics across U.S. cities against average characteristics of the U.S. fleet and infrastructure, significant variability in emissions is found to exist.

The results showed that Cameroon performed weak decoupling throughout this study period. A weak negative decoupling and a strong negative decoupling appeared during the periods 1990\u20131992 and 1993\u20131994, whereas a strong decoupling occurred only from 1994 to 1995 and between 2004 and 2006.

Notable among these innovations are the introduction of modular detector designs that are optimized for low-energy, low-noise data acquisition (e.g., NanoPanel Elite, Philips Healthcare) and the introduction of CT iterative reconstruction techniques (e.g., iDose, Philips Healthcare) that manage dose, maintain image quality, and exhibit reconstruction times that fit within traditional CT workflow. The evolution to more advanced iterative reconstruction algorithms that utilize additional system information to enable further CT radiation dose reduction and image quality improvement is the next step in CT technology innovation. Although these more advanced algorithms have been used in single-photon-emission computed tomography and positron-emission tomography for some time, their use in CT was historically limited by long, clinically unacceptable, reconstruction times. Recently, IMR (Iterative Model Reconstruction, Philips Healthcare), combined with new computational hardware, has demonstrated simultaneous significant improvements in image-quality and significantly lower dose with reconstruction times of less than 5 minutes for a majority of reference protocols.

We confirm previous studies indicating that cellular flavoproteins absorb at 460\u00a0nm and emit at 530\u00a0nm, very similar to that of the FAD moiety. Furthermore, the emission properties of intracellular flavoproteins were altered by the metabolic inhibitors rotenone, antimycin A, azide, cyanide, DNP (2,4-dinitrophenol), and FCCP [carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone]. Kinetic studies revealed flavoprotein emission oscillations in both monocytes and neutrophils. The flavoprotein intensity oscillations correlated with the physiological status of the cell and the nature of membrane receptor ligation. Microscopy revealed the presence of flavoprotein fluorescence in association with the plasma membrane, intracellular granules and distributed throughout the cytoplasm, presumably within mitochondria. Metabolic inhibitors such as cyanide suggest that the plasma membrane and granular components are cyanide-insensitive and therefore are likely associated with the flavoprotein component of the NADPH oxidase, which is located in these two compartments. This interpretation was found to be consistent with structural localization of the NADPH oxidase using an antibody molecule specific for this protein. Using peripheral blood neutrophils, which display less active mitochondria, and time-resolved emission spectroscopy, we show that the NADPH oxidase-associated flavoprotein undergoes a periodic transient reduction of about 54\u00b12\u00a0ms in living cells.

Combining measurements of atmospheric CO 2 and its\nradiocarbon ( 14 CO 2) fraction and transport modeling in atmospheric\ninversions offers a way to derive improved estimates of CO 2 emitted from\nfossil fuel (FFCO 2) . In this study, we solve for the monthly FFCO 2 \nemission budgets at regional scale (i.e., the size of a medium-sized country\nin Europe) and investigate the performance of different observation networks\nand sampling strategies across Europe. The inversion system is built on the\nLMDZv4 global transport model at 3.75 \u2218 \u00d7 \u20092.5 \u2218 \nresolution. We conduct Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) and use\ntwo types of diagnostics to assess the potential of the observation and\ninverse modeling frameworks. The first one relies on the theoretical\ncomputation of the uncertainty in the estimate of emissions from the\ninversion, known as \u201cposterior uncertainty\u201d, and on the uncertainty\nreduction compared to the uncertainty in the inventories of these emissions,\nwhich are used as a prior knowledge by the inversion (called \u201cprior\nuncertainty\u201d). The second one is based on comparisons of prior and posterior\nestimates of the emission to synthetic \u201ctrue\u201d emissions when these true\nemissions are used beforehand to generate the synthetic fossil fuel CO 2 \nmixing ratio measurements that are assimilated in the inversion. With\n17\u00a0stations currently measuring 14 CO 2 across Europe using 2-week\nintegrated sampling, the uncertainty reduction for monthly FFCO 2 \nemissions in a country where the network is rather dense like Germany, is\nlarger than 30\u2009%. With the 43\u00a0 14 CO 2 measurement stations\nplanned in Europe, the uncertainty reduction for monthly FFCO 2 emissions\nis increased for the UK, France, Italy, eastern Europe and the Balkans, depending\non the configuration of prior uncertainty. Further increasing the number of\nstations or the sampling frequency improves the uncertainty reduction (up to\n40 to 70\u2009%) in high emitting regions, but the performance of the\ninversion remains limited over low-emitting regions, even assuming a dense\nobservation network covering the whole of Europe. This study also shows that\nboth the theoretical uncertainty reduction (and resulting posterior\nuncertainty) from the inversion and the posterior estimate of emissions\nitself, for a given prior and \u201ctrue\u201d estimate of the emissions, are highly\nsensitive to the choice between two configurations of the prior uncertainty\nderived from the general estimate by inventory compilers or computations on\nexisting inventories. In particular, when the configuration of the prior\nuncertainty statistics in the inversion system does not match the difference\nbetween these prior and true estimates, the posterior estimate of emissions\ndeviates significantly from the truth. This highlights the difficulty of\nfiltering the targeted signal in the model\u2013data misfit for this specific\ninversion framework, the need to strongly rely on the prior uncertainty\ncharacterization for this and, consequently, the need for improved estimates\nof the uncertainties in current emission inventories for real applications\nwith actual data. We apply the posterior uncertainty in annual emissions to\nthe problem of detecting a trend of FFCO 2 , showing that increasing the\nmonitoring period (e.g., more than 20\u00a0years) is more efficient than reducing\nuncertainty in annual emissions by adding stations. The coarse spatial\nresolution of the atmospheric transport model used in this OSSE (typical of\nmodels used for global inversions of natural CO 2 fluxes) leads to large\nrepresentation errors (related to the inability of the transport model to\ncapture the spatial variability of the actual fluxes and mixing ratios at\nsubgrid scales), which is a key limitation of our OSSE setup to improve the\naccuracy of the monitoring of FFCO 2 emissions in European regions. Using\na high-resolution transport model should improve the potential to retrieve\nFFCO 2 emissions, and this needs to be investigated.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "cd8edad17b21118e63152886e39476c828fe6d00", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2787793176", "DOI": "10.3390/SU10020365", "CorpusId": 59947342}, "title": "A Study on the Analysis of CO2 Emissions of Apartment Housing in the Construction Process", "abstract": "Recent research in the construction industry has focused on the reduction of CO2 emission using quantitative assessment of building life.

Aromatic chemistry also increases the average net O3 production in Korea by 37%. Corrections of daytime PBL heights, which are overestimated in the model compared to lidar observations, increase the net O3 production rate by ~10%. In addition, increasing NOx emissions by 50% in the model shows best performance in reproducing O3 production characteristics, which implies that NOx emissions are underestimated in the current emissions inventory. Sensitivity tests show that a 30% decrease in anthropogenic NOx emissions in Korea increases the O3 production efficiency throughout the country, making rural regions ~2 times more efficient in producing O3 per NOx consumed. Simulated O3 levels overall decrease in the peninsula except for urban and other industrial areas, with the largest increase (~6 ppbv) in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). However, with simultaneous reductions in both NOx and VOCs emissions by 30%, O3 decreases in most of the country, including the SMA. This implies the importance of concurrent emission reductions for both NOx and VOCs in order to effectively reduce O3 levels in Korea.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "a826faf749fd6922799fab350da547a3ef02f87d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2169028684", "DOI": "10.2337/db13-1877", "CorpusId": 8521534, "PubMed": "24848067"}, "title": "Positron Emission Tomography Ligand [11C]5-Hydroxy-Tryptophan Can Be Used as a Surrogate Marker for the Human Endocrine Pancreas", "abstract": "In humans, a well-developed serotonin system is localized to the pancreatic islets while being absent in exocrine pancreas.

Fire regimes are likely to affect the productivity and carbon sequestration potential of savannas, through effects on both biomass and carbon emissions. The carbon sequestration potential has been estimated for some savanna sites by quantifying carbon storage in biomass and soil pools, and the fluxes to these pools. Using different techniques, previous work in these savannas has indicated that net ecosystem productivity [NEP, net primary productivity (NPP) less heterotrophic respiration] was about -3 t C ha-1 y-1 (i.e. a carbon sink). However, the impacts of fire were not accounted for in these calculations. Estimates of NEP have been combined with remotely-sensed estimates of area burnt and associated emissions for an extensive area of mesic savanna in Arnhem Land, NT, Australia. Combining NEP estimates with precise fire data provides an estimate of net biome productivity (NBP), a production index that includes carbon loss through disturbance (fire), and is thus a more realistic indicator of sequestration rate from this biome. This preliminary analysis suggests that NBP is approximately -1 t C ha-1 y-1 (i.e. a carbon sink). A reduction in the annual area burnt is likely to increase the sink size.

Existing measures to reduce emissions from industry are limited due to a combination of competitiveness concerns and a lack of technological options available to producers. In this paper, we assess the possibility of implementing a materials charge to reduce demand for basic industrial products and, hence, also reduce industrial emission levels. The modelling shows that a charge equivalent to around \u20ac80/tCO2 could reduce the EU\u2019s total (energy plus process) CO2 emissions by up to 10% by 2050, depending on the substitution options available. The materials charge could lead to small GDP increases and a minor reduction in overall employment levels. Key policy insights Full carbon price pass through along the materials value chain creates incentives for resource efficiency and substitution in the value chain of material use. Most macroeconomic models ignore mitigation opportunities in the value chain, as do carbon pricing mechanisms for industrial emitters, which largely mute incentives for mitigation opportunities with free allowance allocation. Including consumption at a benchmark level in emission trading systems reinstates a full carbon price incentive for all mitigation opportunities while avoiding competitive distortions and carbon leakage risks. Macroeconomic modelling shows that this allows for an additional 10% emission reduction accompanied by a slight GDP increase and employment reduction.

However, the extent to which these programs have affected net emissions from the use of these improved fuels has not been adequately studied. Here, we estimate the amount of fuelwood displaced and its net emissions impact due to improved access to LPG for cooking in India between 2001 and 2011 using nationally representative household expenditure surveys and census datasets. We account for a suite of climate-relevant emissions (Kyoto gases and other short-lived climate pollutants) and biomass renewability scenarios (a fully renewable and a conservative non-renewable case). We estimate that the national fuelwood displaced due to increased LPG access between 2001 and 2011 was approximately 7.2 million tons. On aggregate, we estimate a net emissions reduction of 6.73 MtCO2e due to the fuelwood displaced from increased access to LPG, when both Kyoto and non-Kyoto climate-active emissions are accounted for and assuming 0.3 as the fraction of non-renewable biomass (fNRB) harvested. However, if only Kyoto gases are considered, we estimate a smaller net emissions decrease of 0.03 MtCO2e (assuming fully renewable biomass harvesting), or 3.05 MtCO2e (assuming 0.3 as the fNRB). We conclude that the transition to LPG cooking in India reduced pressures on forests and achieved modest climate benefits, though uncertainties regarding the extent of non-renewable biomass harvesting and suite of climate-active emissions included in such an estimation can significantly influence results in any given year and should be considered carefully in any analysis and policy-making.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "eb967e82df7f09a820d114d23c7153c491df6627", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2120511820", "DOI": "10.1504/IJETM.2010.029957", "CorpusId": 128627448}, "title": "Trends and challenges in the energy sector of Romania in the post-accession to the European Union", "abstract": "This paper is aimed at presenting some trends and developments with respect to renewable energy sources in the EU and how these sources can be used in the Romanian economy.

When the outcomes of these irreversible regions were assessed after reinjection and compared with rest-redistribution images, there was concordance of data regarding myocardial viability (normal/reversible or irreversible) in 72 of the 91 (79%) irreversible defects. Twenty of the 41 patients also underwent positron emission tomography at rest with [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose and [15O]water. In these patients, stress-redistribution-reinjection and rest-redistribution imaging provided concordant information regarding myocardial viability in 427 (72%) of 594 myocardial regions and discordance in 167 regions. However, when irreversible thallium defects were further analyzed according to the severity of the thallium defect in these discordant regions, 149 of 167 (89%) demonstrated only mild-to-moderate reduction in thallium activity (51% to 85% of normal activity), and positron emission tomography verified 98% of these regions to be metabolically active and viable. Thus, when the severity of thallium activity was considered within irreversible thallium defects, the concordance between stress-redistribution-reinjection and rest-redistribution imaging regarding myocardial viability increased to 94%.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese data indicate that one of two imaging modalities, either stress-redistribution-reinjection or rest-redistribution imaging, may be used for identifying viable myocardium. However, if there are no contraindications to stress testing, stress-redistribution-reinjection imaging provides a more comprehensive assessment of the extent and severity of coronary artery disease by demonstrating regional myocardial ischemia without jeopardizing information on myocardial viability.", "year": 1993}, {"paperId": "4d4511c6635fb9fcf4f520ef9ee6539e374476b2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1996915895", "DOI": "10.1021/IC00147A024", "CorpusId": 33567374}, "title": "Electrogenerated chemiluminescence. 42.

Minimization of flue gas emissions can be brought about by changing fuel, changes to the utility system, process changes, improved heat recovery and chemical treatment in the case of oxides of sulphur and nitrogen.
