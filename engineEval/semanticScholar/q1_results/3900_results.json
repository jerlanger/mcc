One approach is to increase the metallic Fe input to the production system. A common belief is that scrap works as a CO 2 diluent when introduced in iron ore based steelmaking. It is not necessarily so. Scrap is a key supplementary charge material in oxygen steelmaking converters, but scrap can also be utilised in ironmaking where it will decrease the use of'reducing agents and with that also the specific CO 2 emissions. By the use of a process integration model which basically includes the primary processes of cokemaking, sintering, ironmaking and oxygen steelmaking the overall influence of scrap input on CO 2 emissions is demonstrated and commented. The influence of hot metal silicon content is elucidated by calculations with different material and process constraints. The results show that at moderate scrap rates, the reduction of CO 2 emissions is favoured by increased scrap additions to the oxygen converter. When the scrap additions to the converter balances the actual heat capacity of the bath, other means to achieve an increased scrap melting capacity can be taken into account. This include combinations of scrap addition to the blast furnace, increased silicon content in tapped hot metal, and/or addition of Ferro-silicon combined with further scrap additions to the oxygen converter. Different strategies for CO 2 emission reduction have to be suggested depending on if the objective is to minimise the site (direct) emissions or the global (indirect+direct) emissions.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "1c7505d6c3522d9e7d3a16f488f078edff1744be", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2161172791", "DOI": "10.1002/cphc.201000132", "CorpusId": 13054540, "PubMed": "20491134"}, "title": "The route to functional graphene oxide.", "abstract": "We report on an easy-to-use, successful, and reproducible route to synthesize functionalized graphite oxide (GO) and its conversion to graphene-like materials through chemical or thermal reduction of GO.

Therefore nitric oxides cannot be reduced directly, but hybrid processes combining non-thermal plasma pre-treatment with catalytic reduction using either hydrocarbons or ammonia-based reducing agents have to be applied. Plasma-enhanced selective catalytic reduction (PE-SCR) of the nitric oxides emitted from a modern car's diesel engine for values of more than 60% was demonstrated in test bench experiments. For these experiments, a compact dielectric barrier discharge reactor with a flow cross section of 15 cm2 excited by a semiconductor switched pulse voltage source and a urea-based selective catalytic reduction system were applied.

Therefore, BVOC emission are an important input for air quality models. To model these emissions with high spatial resolution, the accuracy of the underlying vegetation inventory is crucial. We present a BVOC emission model that accommodates different vegetation inventories and uses satellite-based measurements of greenness instead of pre-defined vegetation periods. This approach to seasonality implicitly treats effects caused by water or nutrient availability, altitude and latitude on a plant stand. Additionally, we test the influence of proposed seasonal variability in enzyme activity on BVOC emissions. In its present setup, the emission model calculates hourly emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and the oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOC) methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone and acetic acid. In this study, emissions based on three different vegetation inventories are compared with each other and diurnal and seasonal variations in Europe are investigated for the year 2006. Two of these vegetation inventories require information on tree-cover as an input. We compare three different land-cover inventories (USGS GLCC, GLC2000 and Globcover 2.2) with respect to tree-cover. The often-used USGS GLCC land-cover inventory leads to a severe reduction of BVOC emissions due to a potential miss-attribution of broad-leaved trees and reduced tree-cover compared to the two other land-cover inventories. To account for uncertainties in the land-cover classification, we introduce land-cover correction factors for each relevant land-use category to adjust the tree-cover. The results are very sensitive to these factors within the plausible range. For June 2006, total monthly BVOC emissions decreased up to \u221227% with minimal and increased up to +71% with maximal factors, while in January 2006, the changes in monthly BVOC emissions were \u221254 and +56% with minimal and maximal factors, respectively. The new seasonality approach leads to a reduction in the annual emissions compared with non-adjusted data. The strongest reduction occurs in OVOC (up to \u221232 %), the weakest in isoprene (as little as \u221219 %). If also enzyme seasonality is taken into account, however, isoprene reacts with the steepest decrease of annual emissions, which are reduced by \u221244% to \u221249 %, annual emissions of monoterpenes reduce between \u221230 and \u221235 %. The sensitivity of the model to changes in temperature depends on the climatic zone but not on the vegetation inventory. The sensitivity is higher for temperature increases of 3K (+31% to +64 %) than decreases by the same amount (\u221220 to \u221235 %). The climatic zones \u201cCold except summer\u201d and \u201carid\u201d are most sensitive to temperature changes in January for isoprene and monoterpenes, respectively, while in June, \u201cpolar\u201d is most sensitive to temperature for both isoprene and monoterpenes. Our model predicts the oxygenated volatile organic compounds to be the most abundant fraction of the annual European emissions (3571\u20135328 Gg yr\u22121), followed by monoterpenes (2964\u20134124 Gg yr\u22121), isoprene (1450\u20132650 Gg yr\u22121) and sesquiterpenes (150\u2013257 Gg yr\u22121). We find regions with high isoprene emissions (most notably the Iberian Peninsula), but overall, oxygenated VOC dominate with 43\u201345% (depending on the vegetation inventory) contribution to the total annual BVOC emissions in Europe. Isoprene contributes between 18\u201321 %, monoterpenes 33\u201336% and sesquiterpenes contribute 1\u20132 %.We compare the concentrations of biogenic species simulated by an air quality model with measurements of isoprene and monoterpenes in Hohenpeissenberg (Germany) for both summer and winter. The agreement between observed and modelled concentrations is better in summer than in winter. This can partly be explained with the difficulty to model weather conditions in winter accurately, but also with the increased anthropogenic influence on the concentrations of BVOC compounds in winter. Our results suggest that land-cover inventories used to derive tree-cover must be chosen with care. Also, uncertainties in the classification of land-cover pixels must be taken into account and remain high. This problem must be addressed together with the remote sensing community. Our new approach using a greenness index for addressing seasonality of vegetation can be implemented easily in existing models. The importance of OVOC for air quality should be more deeply addressed by future studies, especially in smog chambers. Also, the fate of BVOC from the dominant region of the Iberian Peninsula should be studied more in detail.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "229a1094ff8077e3724d6a324542bcf427b3d08d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2143204661", "DOI": "10.1017/S1431927699000057", "CorpusId": 37062671, "PubMed": "10227827"}, "title": "Iterative X-ray Cone-Beam Tomography for Metal Artifact Reduction and Local Region Reconstruction.", "abstract": ": X-ray cone-beam reconstruction from incomplete projection data has important practical applications, especially in microtomography.

The impacts of individual source sectors on PM2.5 concentrations were assessed through systematic simulations of spatially and temporally resolved particulate matter concentrations, using the GEOS-Chem model, followed by population-weighted aggregation to national and state levels. We find that PM2.5 pollution is a pan-India problem, with a regional character, and is not limited to urban areas or megacities.

The Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei (BTH) region has been suffering from the most severe fine-particle (PM2.\u20095) pollution in China, which causes serious health damage and economic loss. Quantifying the source contributions to PM2.\u20095 concentrations has been a challenging task because of the complicated nonlinear relationships between PM2.\u20095 concentrations and emissions of multiple pollutants from multiple spatial regions and economic sectors. In this study, we use the extended response surface modeling (ERSM) technique to investigate the nonlinear response of PM2.\u20095 concentrations to emissions of multiple pollutants from different regions and sectors over the BTH region, based on over 1000 simulations by a chemical transport model (CTM). The ERSM-predicted PM2.\u20095 concentrations agree well with independent CTM simulations, with correlation coefficients larger than 0.99 and mean normalized errors less than 1\u202f%. Using the ERSM technique, we find that, among all air pollutants, primary inorganic PM2.\u20095 makes the largest contribution (24\u201336\u202f%) to PM2.\u20095 concentrations. The contribution of primary inorganic PM2.\u20095 emissions is especially high in heavily polluted winter and is dominated by the industry as well as residential and commercial sectors, which should be prioritized in PM2.\u20095 control strategies. The total contributions of all precursors (nitrogen oxides, NOx; sulfur dioxides, SO2; ammonia, NH3; non-methane volatile organic compounds, NMVOCs; intermediate-volatility organic compounds, IVOCs; primary organic aerosol, POA) to PM2.\u20095 concentrations range between 31 and 48\u202f%. Among these precursors, PM2.\u20095 concentrations are primarily sensitive to the emissions of NH3, NMVOC\u202f+\u202fIVOC, and POA. The sensitivities increase substantially for NH3 and NOx and decrease slightly for POA and NMVOC\u202f+\u202fIVOC with the increase in the emission reduction ratio, which illustrates the nonlinear relationships between precursor emissions and PM2.\u20095 concentrations.

In addition, we wanted to determine the reliability with which a clinical examiner could predict a typical, idealized audiometric configuration from TEOAE measurements. In the hearing-impaired subjects (n = 149), a 50% reduction of OAE incidence was caused by a mean HL of 10.5 dB for TEOAE compared to 27 dB SPL for DPOAE. A 90% incidence reduction was found at a mean threshold elevation of 33 dB for TEOAE and 51 dB for DPOAE. Correlation between TEOAE amplitudes and HL was in general rather low (r = \u20130.1 to \u20130.5), while DPOAE amplitudes showed a slightly better correlation with HL (r = \u20130.3 to \u20130.6). In general, efforts to derive an audiogram from evoked OAE have been more promising for DPOAE than for TEOAE.

Here, we quantitatively investigated the variation of air pollutants in China using long-term comprehensive data sets from 2013 to 2017, during which Chinese government made major efforts to reduce anthropogenic emission in polluted regions. Our results show a significant decreasing trend in the PM2.5 concentration in heavily polluted regions of eastern China, with an annual decrease of \u223c7% compared with measurements in 2013. The measured decreased concentrations of SO2, NO2 and CO (a proxy for anthropogenic volatile organic compounds) could explain a large fraction of the decreased PM2.5 concentrations in different regions. As a consequence, the heavily polluted days decreased significantly in corresponding regions. Concentrations of organic aerosol, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium and chloride measured in urban Beijing revealed a remarkable reduction from 2013 to 2017, connecting the decreases in aerosol precursors with corresponding chemical components closely. However, surface-ozone concentrations showed increasing trends in most urban stations from 2013 to 2017, which indicates stronger photochemical pollution. The boundary-layer height in capital cities of eastern China showed no significant trends over the Beijing\u2013Tianjin\u2013Hebei, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta regions from 2013 to 2017, which confirmed the reduction in anthropogenic emissions.

However, VOC emissions reductions were found to have only a modest impact on modeled peak 8-hr ozone concentrations.

This is because maritime transport is the fifth largest contributor to air pollution and carbon emissions, and the growth rate of trade makes the problem even more pressing. However, considerable environmental improvements can be obtained by changing shipping practices. Current policy actions targeting issues such as emissions relate mainly to the quality of fuel used and to the available technological options. Market based instruments such as emissions trading are under discussion at international level within the IMO. Furthermore, the inclusion of the maritime transport sector within the EU Emission Trading Scheme is on the agenda of the EU strategy to address GHGs. The complexity of air pollution and climate change policies for the international maritime transport sector calls for a wide range of considerations to be taken into account requiring policymakers: 1) to set binding long-term emission reduction goals, 2) to take action in a flexible manner, 3) to ensure knowledge and technology sharing of innovative practices, and 4) transparency, administrative feasibility.

It sketches the \u2018state of the art\u2019 with regard to the main methodological aspects of designing policy measures to regulate air emissions from maritime transport. These are: identification of the impacts; estimation of emissions, and identification and selection of technological and policy options to abate air emissions from ships.

Moreover, the magnitude of synergistic interaction between anthropogenic and biogenic emissions should be carefully quantified, and this issue is not accounted for in most previous investigations. In this study, we performed a summer seasonal (June to August 1995) model evaluation of surface ozone across the continental United States. A three-dimensional regional climate, emissions, and air quality modeling system was used to do the simulations. The factor separation (FS) technique was applied to quantify the contributions from biogenic emissions alone and those from the synergy between anthropogenic and biogenic emissions.

Replacing fertiliser nitrogen with biologically fixed\nnitrogen (BFN) through legumes has been suggested as a strategy for nitrous\noxide (N2O) mitigation from intensively managed grasslands. While\ncurrent literature provides evidence for an N2O emission reduction\neffect due to reduced fertiliser input, little is known about the effect of\nincreased legume proportions potentially offsetting these reductions, i.e.\nby increased N2O emissions from plant residues and root exudates. In\norder to assess the overall effect of this mitigation strategy on permanent\ngrassland, we performed an in situ experiment and quantified net N2O fluxes\nand biomass yields in two differently managed grass\u2013clover mixtures. We\nmeasured N2O fluxes in an unfertilised parcel with high clover\nproportions vs. an organically fertilised control parcel with low clover\nproportions using the eddy covariance (EC) technique over 2\u00a0years.\nFurthermore, we related the measured N2O fluxes to management and\nenvironmental drivers.

The substantial decreases in ambient SO/sub 2/ concentrations measured at urban sites in the eastern and midwestern U.S. are consistent with the corresponding reductions in local SO/sub 2/ emissions, but these decreases have been accompanied by only modest decreases in ambient sulfate concentrations. Large differences in the amounts of SO/sub 2/ emitted within individual air quality control regions are associated with much smaller differences in the corresponding ambient sulfate concentrations. Substantial changes in the patterns of SO/sub 2/ emissions between air quality regions result in essentially no differences between ambient sulfate concentrations in those air quality regions. Comparisons of several air quality regions in the eastern and western U.S. with similar SO/sub 2/ emission levels and patterns of emissions clearly demonstrates the higher ambient sulfate concentration levels in eastern air quality control regions. Relationships between SO/sub 2/, sulfates, and vanadium concentrations at eastern nonurban U.S. sites cannot be explained by local emission sources. These various observed results can be best explained by long distance sulfur oxide transportmore\u00a0\u00bb with chemical conversion of SO/sub 2/ to sulfates occurring over ranges of hundreds of kilometers.

An impact of long range transport of sulfates is to emphasize the need for consistent strategies for reduction of sulfur oxides throughout large geographical regions.

Approximately 11% of these emissions were in the form of CO2, 36% in the form of CH4 and 53% in the form of N2O. The CO2 emissions were from soils; CH4 emissions were from enteric fermentation and manure, and N2O emissions were primarily a function of cropping practices and manure management. With the emissions from all other agricultural practices included, such as the emissions from fossil fuels used for transportation, manufacturing, food processing etc., the agricultural sector's contributions were about 15% of Canada's emissions. In this publication, several options are examined as to their potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. These involve soil and crop management, soil nutrient management, improved feeding strategies, and carbon storage in industrial by-products. The Canadian Economic Emissions Model for Agriculture (CEEMA) was used to predict the greenhouse gas emissions for the year 2010, as well as the impact of mitigation options on greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector. This model incorporates the Canadian Regional Agricultural sub-Model (CRAM), which predicts the activities related to agriculture in Canada up to 2010, as well as a Greenhouse Gas Emissions sub-Model (GGEM), which estimates the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the various agricultural activities. The greenhouse gas emissions from all agricultural sources were 90.5 Tg CO2 equivalent in 1991. Estimates based on CEEMA for the year 2010 indicate emissions are expected to be 98.0 Tg CO2 equivalent under a business as usual scenario, which assumes that the present trends in management practices will continue. The agricultural sector will then need to reduce its emissions by about 12.9 Tg CO2 equivalent below 2010 forecasted emissions, if it is to attain its part of the Canadian government commitment made in Kyoto. Technologies focusing on increasing the soil carbon sink, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving the overall farming efficiency, need to be refined and developed as best management practices. The soils carbon sink can be increased through reduced tillage, reduced summer fallowing, increased use of grasslands and forage crops, etc. Key areas for the possible reduction of greenhouse gas emissions are improved soil nutrient management, improved manure storage and handling, better livestock grazing and feeding strategies, etc. The overall impact of these options is dependent on the adoption rate. Agriculture's greenhouse gas reduction commitment could probably be met if soils are recognized as a carbon sink under the Kyoto Accord and if a wide range of management practices are adopted on a large scale. None of these options can currently be recommended as measures because their socio-economic aspects have not been fully evaluated and there are still too many uncertainties in the emission estimates.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "bc2cd49cb3f273373044ff56173244e86b32bbec", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1584315465", "CorpusId": 85550834}, "title": "MAGNITUDE AND VALUE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS FOR SIX DRIVING CYCLES IN FOUR U.S. CITIES WITH VARYING AIR QUALITY PROBLEMS", "abstract": "The emissions of logically competing mid-1990 gasoline vehicles (GVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) are estimated as if the vehicles were driven in the same pattern of driving.

These steps are repeated using specifics of fuel composition, electric power mix, and environmental conditions applicable to Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, and New York in the month of July. The year 2000 emissions differences for each of four regulated pollutants - HC, CO, NO{sub x,} SO{sub x} - are estimated. CO{sub 2} emissions are also estimated. With use of EVs, HC and CO emissions are consistently lowered by 98% or more. CO{sub 2} emissions reductions are uniformly large at low speed, but variable at high speed. It is found that initially introduced EVs could achieve 100% emission reductions in Chicago by using off-peak power from nuclear power plants for EV electricity generation. Emissions reductions occur for all combinations in Los Angeles, and for most combinations in New York, excepting SO{sub x}. NO{sub x} emissions are reduced in all four cities.

The purpose of this study is to understand the environmental impact of PET recycling system, in which used bottles are recycled into both fibre and bottles, and to compare the recycling system with single-use PET.MethodsConsequential LCA modelling was applied to understand four change-oriented effects for the recycling system. These include the effect of multiple-recycling trips, the effect of changing the share of recycled PET pellets used to make bottles or fibre, the effect of changing the reference system and the effect of introducing bio-based PET. The functional unit of the baseline case was determined as 350\u00a0kg of bottles and 650\u00a0kg of fibre based on the current market demand of PET. The system boundary is cradle to grave excluding the use phase. We applied the \u201csystem expansion\u201d method to open-loop recycling. The analysis compares the baseline recycling system, where PET is recycled once, with the reference system, where PET is not recycled. The environmental impacts assessed are non-renewable energy use and global warming.Results and discussionThe baseline recycling system reduces both impacts by 20% when compared to the reference system. Multiple-recycling trips can maximally reduce the impacts by 26% but the additional savings are negligible after three recycling trips. Bottle-to-fibre recycling offers more impact reduction than bottle-to-bottle recycling when more fibre is needed than bottles in a functional unit. The maximal impact reduction of 25% can be achieved when all recycled PET pellets are used to make fibre. If the functional unit is reversed, i.e. changed to 650\u00a0kg of bottles and 350\u00a0kg of fibre, 30% of the impact reduction can be achieved. Both impacts can be further reduced when the quantity of the recycled PET is maximised. The bio-based PET recycling system, offers at least 36% impact reduction, has the lowest impact among all systems studied. The sensitivity analyses show that the recycled PET content in a recycled bottle is not influential to the overall environmental performance.ConclusionsAll PET recycling systems in this study show important impact reduction compared to the reference system. The impact savings are around 20\u201330% depends on the configurations of the recycling system.

The first major carbon offset programme, the United Nations\u2019 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), has been criticized for generating a large number of credits from projects that do not actually reduce emissions. Following the controversial CDM experience, California pioneered a second-generation compliance offset programme that shifts the focus of quality control from assessments of individual projects to the development of offset protocols, which define project type-specific eligibility criteria and methods for estimating emissions reductions. We assess the ability of California\u2019s \u2018standardized approach\u2019 to mitigate the risk of over-crediting greenhouse gas reductions by reviewing the development of two California offset protocols \u2013 Mine Methane Capture and Rice Cultivation. We examine the regulator\u2019s treatment of three sources of over-crediting under the CDM: non-additional projects, inflated counterfactual baseline scenarios, and perverse incentives that inadvertently increase emissions. We find that the standardized approach offers the ability to reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of over-crediting. This requires careful protocol-scale analysis, conservative methods for estimating reductions, ongoing monitoring of programme outcomes, and restricting participation to project types with manageable levels of uncertainty in emission reductions. However, several of these elements are missing from California\u2019s regime, and even best practices result in significant uncertainty in true emission reductions. Relying on carbon offsets to lower compliance costs risks lessening total emission reductions and increases uncertainty in whether an emissions target has been met. Key policy insights Substantial and ongoing oversight by offset programme administrators is needed to contain uncertainty and avoid over-crediting. California\u2019s Mine Methane Capture Protocol may have influenced federal decisions not to regulate methane emissions from coal mines on federally-owned lands. Government priorities and methodological choices drive outcomes in carbon pricing policies with large offset programmes, contrary to the common perception that these policies delegate decision-making to private actors.

Seasonal variability was large for CO with a winter to summer reduction of 69\u202f%, and monthly fluxes were strongly anti-correlated with mean air temperature. The winter increment in CO emissions was attributed mainly to vehicle cold starts and reduced fuel combustion efficiency. CO2 fluxes were 33\u202f% higher in winter than in summer and anti-correlated with mean air temperature, albeit to a lesser extent than for CO. This was attributed to an increased demand for natural gas for heating during the winter. CH4 fluxes exhibited moderate seasonality (21\u202f% larger in winter), and a spatially variable linear anti-correlation with air temperature. Differences in resident population within the flux footprint explained up to 90\u202f% of the spatial variability of the annual CO2 fluxes and up to 99\u202f% for CH4. Furthermore, we suggest that biogenic sources of CH4, such as wastewater, which is unaccounted for by the atmospheric emissions inventories, make a substantial contribution to the overall budget and that commuting dynamics in and out of central business districts could explain some of the spatial and temporal variability of CO2 and CH4 emissions.

An increasing optical basicity of the glasses results in a shift in the peak position of the 5d-4f emission of Ce3+ to longer wavelengths and in a decrease in the Ce3+ fluorescence intensity due to decreasing Ce3+/Ce4+ ratios. Argon-bubbling of the melt and supplying argon as melting atmosphere and/or using small amounts of metallic aluminum powder as raw material led to an almost complete reduction of Ce4+ to Ce3+. This resulted in much higher intensities of the Ce3+ fluorescence emission which runs parallel to a decreasing charge transfer absorption of Ce4+. From the absorption spectra of these samples extinction coefficients for Ce4+ and Ce3+ were calculated. For this purpose, an additional sample was prepared by using oxygen bubbling of the melt. An increasing cerium concentration shifts the Ce3+ emission peak position to longer wavelengths, while up to 2\u00b71020 ions per cm3 only a slight increase in the Ce3+ emission intensity was observed.

The aim of this study was to provide insights into the Indonesian government\u2019s approach to developing a strategy and plan for mitigating emissions and achieving Indonesia\u2019s emission reduction targets by 2030, as pledged in the country\u2019s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution. The Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium (AIM/CGE) model was used to quantify three scenarios that had the same socioeconomic assumptions: baseline, countermeasure (CM)1, and CM2, which had a higher emission reduction target than that of CM1. Results of the study showed that an Indonesian low-carbon energy system could be achieved with two pillars, namely, energy efficiency measures and deployment of less carbon-intensive energy systems (i.e., the use of renewable energy in the power and transport sectors, and the use of natural gas in the power sector and in transport). Emission reductions would also be satisfied through the electrification of end-user consumption where the electricity supply becomes decarbonized by deploying renewables for power generation. Under CM1, Indonesia could achieve a 15.5% emission reduction target (compared to the baseline scenario). This reduction could be achieved using efficiency measures that reduce final energy demand by 4%; This would require the deployment of geothermal power plants at a rate six times greater than the baseline scenario and four times the use of hydropower than that used in the baseline scenario. Greater carbon reductions (CM2; i.e., a 27% reduction) could be achieved with similar measures to CM1 but with more intensive penetration. Final energy demand would need to be cut by 13%, deployment of geothermal power plants would need to be seven times greater than at baseline, and hydropower use would need to be five times greater than the baseline case. Carbon prices under CM1 and CM2 were US$16 and US$63 (2005)/tCO2, respectively. The mitigation scenarios for 2030 both had a small positive effect on gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the baseline scenario (0.6% and 0.3% for CM1 and CM2, respectively). This is mainly due to the combination of two assumptions. The first is that there would be a great increase in coal-fired power in the baseline scenario. The other assumption is that there is low productivity in coal-related industries. Eventually, when factors such as capital and labor shift from coal-related industries to other low-carbon-emitting sectors in the CM cases are put in place, the total productivity of the economy would offset low-carbon investment.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "03790f77da56969633b005a6d82dc1443fb4e28a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2171917957", "DOI": "10.1080/08958370701533509", "CorpusId": 39605245, "PubMed": "17917919"}, "title": "The Impact of Biodiesel on Pollutant Emissions and Public Health", "abstract": "An overview of recent studies of the impact of biodiesel and biodiesel blends on air pollutant emissions and health effects is provided.

Atmospheric Hg0 is the dominant source of foliar Hg and the involvement of HgII is not supported by isotopic evidence.

Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses of the data were carried out to help achieve these goals. PMF analyses revealed three contributing factors that were identified with different emission source types: factor 1, combustion/traffic; factor 2, fugitive natural gas; and factor 3, fugitive condensate. Compositional signatures of the three contributing factors were identified through comparison with independently derived emission source profiles. Fugitive emissions of natural gas and of condensate were the two principal emission source types for NMHC.

Interestingly, the large differences of SOC constants of the halides are not obviously displayed in the triplet state properties.

We conclude that for irradiated copper, and presumably related materials, nano-scale in situ testing can determine bulk-like yield strengths and simultaneously identify deformation mechanisms.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "e7bad01170739d984b209213640bbf61f46114b0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2810691740", "DOI": "10.1007/s10584-018-2226-y", "CorpusId": 158691408}, "title": "Global energy sector emission reductions and bioenergy use: overview of the bioenergy demand phase of the EMF-33 model comparison", "abstract": "We present an overview of results from 11 integrated assessment models (IAMs) that participated in the 33rd study of the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum (EMF-33) on the viability of large-scale deployment of bioenergy for achieving long-run climate goals. The study explores future bioenergy use across models under harmonized scenarios for future climate policies, availability of bioenergy technologies, and constraints on biomass supply. This paper provides a more transparent description of IAMs that span a broad range of assumptions regarding model structures, energy sectors, and bioenergy conversion chains. Without emission constraints, we find vastly different CO2 emission and bioenergy deployment patterns across models due to differences in competition with fossil fuels, the possibility to produce large-scale bio-liquids, and the flexibility of energy systems. Imposing increasingly stringent carbon budgets mostly increases bioenergy use. A diverse set of available bioenergy technology portfolios provides flexibility to allocate bioenergy to supply different final energy as well as remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by combining bioenergy with carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS). Sector and regional bioenergy allocation varies dramatically across models mainly due to bioenergy technology availability and costs, final energy patterns, and availability of alternative decarbonization options. Although much bioenergy is used in combination with CCS, BECCS is not necessarily the driver of bioenergy use. We find that the flexibility to use biomass feedstocks in different energy sub-sectors makes large-scale bioenergy deployment a robust strategy in mitigation scenarios that is surprisingly insensitive with respect to reduced technology availability. However, the achievability of stringent carbon budgets and associated carbon prices is sensitive. Constraints on biomass feedstock supply increase the carbon price less significantly than excluding BECCS because carbon removals are still realized and valued. Incremental sensitivity tests find that delayed readiness of bioenergy technologies until 2050 is more important than potentially higher investment costs.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "c4d10c72c64fa48f06b77501417ef6dedcc8de37", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1984044169", "DOI": "10.6090/JARQ.41.173", "CorpusId": 83742328}, "title": "Biomethanol Production and CO2 Emission Reduction from Forage Grasses, Trees, and Crop Residues", "abstract": "With a wide array of potentially renewable energy resources, the concept and proposed benefits evolving from the use of biofuels are inspiring. Recently, a new approach for gasification of biomass by partial oxidation and subsequent biomethanol production has been developed and is being evaluated at the \"Norin Green No. 1 (renamed as Norin Biomass No. 1)\" test plant in Nagasaki, Japan. To determine a useful protocol for producing biomethanol, various kinds of biomass resources, such as sawdust and bark of Japanese cedar, chipped Japanese larch, bamboo, salix, cut waste wood from demolition sites, sorghum, and bran, straw, and husks of rice were evaluated for their biofuel-use characteristics. From this analysis, lignocellulosic resources (wood materials) and rice bran were estimated to produce a high methanol yield (55% by weight), whereas rice straw and husks were estimated to produce lower methanol yield of 36% and 39%, respectively. On the basis of the data obtained from the test plant, the net heat yield by the methanol production of a full-scale commercial plant was estimated to be ca. 40%. Each of these products is a clean material, readily obtained and highly useful for biomethanol production. Developing nations interested in constructing a national energy policy should focus upon the establishment of a biofuel-based economy. Recycling of agricultural and forest industry by-products has been previously shown to reduce the demand for fossil fuels and provides a more ecologically friendly energy resource.

In the first 7 months following the onset of the pandemic, more than 200 papers were accepted by peer-reviewed journals utilizing observations from ground-based and satellite instruments. Only about one-third of this literature incorporates a specific method for meteorological correction or normalization for comparing data from the lockdown period with prior reference observations despite the importance of doing so on the interpretation of results. We use the government stringency index (SI) as an indicator for the severity of lockdown measures and show how key air pollutants change as the SI increases. The observed decrease of NO2 with increasing SI is in general agreement with emission inventories that account for the lockdown. Other compounds such as O3, PM2.5, and CO are also broadly covered. Due to the importance of atmospheric chemistry on O3 and PM2.5 concentrations, their responses may not be linear with respect to primary pollutants. At most sites, we found O3 increased, whereas PM2.5 decreased slightly, with increasing SI. Changes of other compounds are found to be understudied.

Two of the satellite-derived inventories are estimated by using the DECSO (Daily Emission derived Constrained by Satellite Observations) algorithm, which is based on an extended Kalman filter applied to observations from OMI or from GOME-2. The other two are derived with the EnKF algorithm, which is based on an ensemble Kalman filter applied to observations of multiple species using either the chemical transport model CHASER and MIROC-chem. The temporal behaviour and spatial distribution of the inventories are compared on a national and regional scale. A distinction is also made between urban and rural areas. The intercomparison of all inventories shows good agreement in total NOx emissions over mainland China, especially for trends, with an average bias of about 20\u202f% for yearly emissions. All the inventories show the typical emission reduction of 10\u202f% during the Chinese New Year and a peak in December. Satellite-derived approaches using OMI show a summer peak due to strong emissions from soil and biomass burning in this season. Biases in NOx emissions and uncertainties in temporal variability increase quickly when the spatial scale decreases. The analyses of the differences show the importance of using observations from multiple instruments and a high spatial resolution model for the satellite-derived inventories, while for bottom-up inventories, accurate emission factors and activity information are required. The advantage of the satellite-derived approach is that the emissions are soon available after observation, while the strength of the bottom-up inventories is that they include detailed information of emissions for each source category.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "483da67fd483ad7f8d3cd388ae82c067ddf97fc9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1966813576", "DOI": "10.1002/ANA.410390515", "CorpusId": 11083928, "PubMed": "8619551"}, "title": "The effect of ethanol on alcohol\u2010responsive essential tremor: A positron emission tomography study", "abstract": "We used H215O positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the effect of ethyl alcohol on regional cerebral blood flow in 6 patients with alcohol\u2010responsive essential tremor and 6 age\u2010matched control subjects.

As part of the current review of the ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS), the US EPA evaluated the health exposure and risks associated with ambient ozone pollution using a statistical approach to adjust recent air quality to simulate just meeting the current standard level, without specifying emission control strategies. One drawback of this purely statistical concentration rollback approach is that it does not take into account spatial and temporal heterogeneity of ozone response to emissions changes. The application of the higher-order decoupled direct method (HDDM) in the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model is discussed here to provide an example of a methodology that could incorporate this variability into the risk assessment analyses. Because this approach includes a full representation of the chemical production and physical transport of ozone in the atmosphere, it does not require assumed background concentrations, which have been applied to constrain estimates from past statistical techniques. The CMAQ-HDDM adjustment approach is extended to measured ozone concentrations by determining typical sensitivities at each monitor location and hour of the day based on a linear relationship between first-order sensitivities and hourly ozone values. This approach is demonstrated by modeling ozone responses for monitor locations in Detroit and Charlotte to domain-wide reductions in anthropogenic NOx and VOCs emissions. As seen in previous studies, ozone response calculated using HDDM compared well to brute-force emissions changes up to approximately a 50% reduction in emissions. A new stepwise approach is developed here to apply this method to emissions reductions beyond 50% allowing for the simulation of more stringent reductions in ozone concentrations.

In the absence of a biological marker, diagnosis is reliant on clinical evaluation. Confirmation is often sought from neuroimaging, including single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Most previous SPECT studies lack pathological validation. Aim: To examine the accuracy of SPECT in differentiating FTD from AD in patients with subsequent pathological confirmation. Methods: Technetium-99-labelled hexamethyl propylene amine oxime SPECT images obtained at initial evaluation in 25 pathologically confirmed cases of FTD were examined. These images were visually rated by an experienced blinded nuclear medicine consultant and compared with those of 31 patients with AD, also with pathological validation. Results: A reduction in frontal cerebral blood flow (CBF) was more common in FTD and was of diagnostic value (sensitivity 0.8, specificity 0.65 and likelihood ratio (LR) 2.25; 95% CI 1.35 to 3.77). A pattern of bilateral frontal CBF reduction without the presence of associated bilateral parietal CBF change is diagnostically more accurate (sensitivity 0.80, specificity 0.81 and +LR 4.13, 95% CI 1.96 to 8.71). Diagnostic categorisation (FTD or AD) on the basis of SPECT alone was less accurate than clinical diagnosis (based on neurology and detailed neuropsychological evaluation). One patient with FTD was initially clinically misdiagnosed as AD, owing to the lack of availability of full neuropsychological assessment.

Zinc sulfide-catalyzed photoreduction of aldehydes and related derivatives: two-electron-transfer reduction and relationship with spectroscopic properties", "abstract": "Photocatalytic activity and spectroscopic properties of ZnS suspensions for the two-electron reduction of aldehydes or related compounds in aqueous medium are described. The ZnS suspension (ZnS-O) prepared by cooling from aqueous ZnSO{sub 4} and Na{sub 2}S solutions catalyzes photoredox reactions of acetaldehyde, giving ethanol without much H{sub 2} evolution as a two-electron-reduction product, and acetic acid, biacetyl, and acetoin as oxidation products. When the ZnS-O suspension is refluxed (giving ZnS-100) or dried to powder, the resulting ZnS shows an increased activity for H{sub 2} evolution but a decreased activity for the two-electron reduction. The two-electron photoreduction is ascribed to the sequential transfer of active electrons in the conduction band of defect-free aggregates of ZnS microcrystallites (quantized ZnS). This mechanism is supported by product analysis, energetics at ZnS interfaces, the sharp and blue-shifted onset of absorption and excitation spectra, and the long-life band gap emission of the active ZnS-O suspension. UV, emission, and ESR spectra, as well as the enhancement of the particle size and crystallinity, suggest that the activity change observed after heating or drying to powder is due to the formation of surface states which may trap active electrons. This interpretation is also supported by the generated activity ofmore\u00a0\u00bb ZnS-100 for the H{sub 2} photoevolution under >350-nm irradiation.

This study explores the impacts of technology limitations on greenhouse gas emission reductions using the integrated model IMAGE. It shows that the required short-term emission reductions to achieve long-term radiative forcing targets strongly depend on assumptions on the availability and potential of mitigation technologies. Limited availability of mitigation technologies which are relatively important in the long run implies that lower short-term emission levels are required. For instance, limited bio-energy availability reduces the optimal 2020 emission level by more than 4 GtCO2eq in order to compensate the reduced availability of negative emissions from bioenergy and carbon capture and storage (BECCS) in the long run. On the other hand, reduced mitigation potential of options that are used in 2020 can also lead to a higher optimal level for 2020 emissions. The results also show the critical role of BECCS for achieving low radiative forcing targets in IMAGE. Without these technologies achieving these targets become much more expensive or even infeasible.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "b7d95d16a131c561d246e35680abff0b01456bb0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2000328538", "DOI": "10.1063/1.3481078", "CorpusId": 120452255}, "title": "Benefits of homoepitaxy on the properties of nonpolar (Zn,Mg)O/ZnO quantum wells on a-plane ZnO substrates", "abstract": "We report on the properties of nonpolar (Zn,Mg)O/ZnO quantum wells (QW) homoepitaxially grown by molecular beam epitaxy on a-plane ZnO substrates.

We report numerical simulation results which suggest that impacts on welfare, trade, and emissions will likely be small. This is because proposed measures use carbon emissions in the importing country in producing goods similar to imports rather than carbon content in calculating the size of barriers. Moreover, because border adjustments involve both tariffs and export rebates, it is the differences in emissions intensity across sector rather than emissions level which matters. Where there is no difference in emissions intensities across sectors, Lerner symmetry holds for the border adjustment and no relative effects occur. In our numerical simulation analyses border tax adjustments accompany carbon emission reduction commitments made either unilaterally , or as part of a global treaty and to be applied against non signatories. We use a four-region (US, EU, China, ROW) general equilibrium structure which captures energy trade and has endogenously determined energy supply so that global emissions can change with policy changes. We calibrate our model to 2006 data and analyze the potential impacts of both EU and US carbon pricing at various levels, either along with or without carbon motivated BTAs policies on welfare, emissions, trade flows and production. Results indicate only small impacts of these measures on global emissions, trade and welfare, but the signs of effects are as expected. BTAs alleviate leakage effects as expected. In trade impacts, compared with no BTAs, BTAs reduce imports of committing countries, and increase imports by other countries. EU and US BTAs against China reduce exports by China. With BTAs, the value of production in the country with carbon reduction measures are introduced increases, and other country's production decreases compared with the case of no BTAs. With the contraction of world trade flows caused by the financial crisis, carbon motivated BTAs offer a prospect of a compounding effect in a world which is going protectionist and decarbonized at the same time, but the added effects of BTAs seems small.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "f4bc7b44eedc225f00344b4380355f0b717b6a16", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2124413355", "DOI": "10.1016/J.TRANPOL.2010.05.005", "CorpusId": 7161736}, "title": "PM, NOx and CO2 emission reductions from speed management policies in Europe", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "d4b40ef18d42474c587e72996595103dbbe548fc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2569678346", "PubMedCentral": "5473634", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms13793", "CorpusId": 6791777, "PubMed": "28067219"}, "title": "Luminescent hyperbolic metasurfaces", "abstract": "When engineered on scales much smaller than the operating wavelength, metal-semiconductor nanostructures exhibit properties unobtainable in nature.

Using an unconventional multilayer architecture, we demonstrate luminescent hyperbolic metasurfaces, wherein distributed semiconducting quantum wells display extreme absorption and emission polarization anisotropy. Through normally incident micro-photoluminescence measurements, we observe absorption anisotropies greater than a factor of 10 and degree-of-linear polarization of emission >0.9. We observe the modification of emission spectra and, by incorporating wavelength-scale gratings, show a controlled reduction of polarization anisotropy.

The concentration dependence of the corrected fluorescence signal is examined and is shown to be linear. The variation of the fluorescence spectra with excitation wavelength suggests a two\u2010component fluorescence, for the wavelength range studied.
