The reflection reduction at microwave frequencies mainly results from the phase cancellation technique, while the infrared emission reduction is due to the reflection of the metal with a high filling ration in the top layer. It has been analytically indicated that reflection reduction with an efficiency larger than 10 dB can be achieved in the frequency band of 8.2-18 GHz, and this has been well verified by the simulated and experimental results.

However, motion artifacts in the 18F fluorodioxydoglucose (FDG) PET images caused by respiration persists to be an important factor in degrading PET image quality and quantification. Motion artifacts lead to two major effects: First, it affects the accuracy of quantitation, producing a reduction of the measured standard uptake value (SUV). Second, the apparent lesion volume is overestimated. Both impact upon the usage of PET images for radiation treatment planning. The first affects the visibility, or contrast, of the lesion. The second results in an increase in the planning target volume, and consequently a greater radiation dose to the normal tissues. One way to compensate for this effect is by applying a multiple-frame capture technique. The PET data are then acquired in synchronization with the respiratory motion. Reduction in smearing due to gating was investigated in both phantoms and patient studies. Phantom studies showed a dependence of the reduction in smearing on the lesion size, the motion amplitude, and the number of bins used for data acquisition.

Due to its aromatic structure and long residence time, biochar may enable long-term carbon sequestration. At the same time, biochar has the potential to improve soil fertility and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soils. However, the effect of biochar application on GHG fluxes from soil must be investigated before recommendations for field-scale biochar application can be made. A laboratory experiment was designed to measure carbon dioxide (CO) and nitrous oxide (NO) emissions from two Irish soils with the addition of two different biochars, along with endogeic (soil-feeding) earthworms and ammonium sulfate, to assist in the overall evaluation of biochar as a GHG-mitigation tool. A significant reduction in NO emissions was observed from both low and high organic matter soils when biochars were applied at rates of 4% (w/w). Earthworms significantly increased NO fluxes in low and high organic matter soils more than 12.6-fold and 7.8-fold, respectively. The large increase in soil NO emissions in the presence of earthworms was significantly reduced by the addition of both biochars. biochar reduced the large earthworm emissions by 91 and 95% in the low organic matter soil and by 56 and 61% in the high organic matter soil (with and without N fertilization), respectively. With peanut hull biochar, the earthworm emissions reduction was 80 and 70% in the low organic matter soil, and only 20 and 10% in the high organic matter soil (with and without N fertilization), respectively. In high organic matter soil, both biochars reduced CO efflux in the absence of earthworms. However, soil CO efflux increased when peanut hull biochar was applied in the presence of earthworms.

Although similar seasonal cycles in VOC emissions from terrestrial ecosystems have been reported, regional emissions inventories generally omit the effect of seasonality on emissions. We compiled measurement data on seasonal variations in monoterpene emissions potentials for two evergreen species (Quercus ilex and Pinus pinea) and used these data to construct two contrasting seasonal response functions for the inclusion in monoterpene emission models. We included these responses in the Niinemets et al. model and compared simulation results to those of the MEGAN model, both with and without its predicted seasonality. The effect of seasonality on regional monoterpene emissions inventories for European Mediterranean forests dominated by these species was tested for both models, using the GOTILWA+ biosphere model platform. The consideration of seasonality in the Niinemets et al. model reduced total estimated annual monoterpene emissions by up to 65% in some regions, with largest reductions at lower latitudes. The MEGAN model demonstrated a much weaker seasonal response than that in the Niinemets et al. model, and did not capture the between species seasonality differences found in this study. Results suggest that previous regional model inventories based on one fixed emission factor likely overestimate regional emissions, and species-specific expressions of seasonality may be necessary.

For comparison, diaminofluorescein (DAF) and diaminorhodamine (DAR) were used as NO indicators. NO oxidation to nitrite and nitrate was quantified after reduction of nitrite + nitrate to NO by vandium (III) with subsequent chemiluminescence detection (i.e. indirect chemiluminescence). Nitrite and NADH consumption were also measured. Anaerobic nitrite-dependent NO emission was exclusively associated with the membrane fraction, without participation of matrix components. Rates of nitrite and NADH consumption matched, whereas the rate of NO emission was lower. In air, mitochondria apparently produced no nitrite-dependent NO, and no NOS activity was detected by direct or indirect chemiluminescence. In contrast, with DAF-2 or DAR-4M, an l-arginine-dependent fluorescence increase took place. However, the response of this apparent low NOS activity to inhibitors, substrates and cofactors was untypical when compared with commercial inducible NOS (iNOS), and the existence of NOS in root mitochondria is therefore doubtful. In a solution of commercial iNOS, about two-thirds of the NO (measured as NADPH consumption) were oxidized to nitrite + nitrate.

We compare a \"No Control\" scenario with global sulfur limits and regionally applied reductions. We show that, if no control measures are taken, near surface sulfate increases by about 10-20% over the main transoceanic shipping routes from 2002 to 2012. A reduction of the maximum fuel sulfur (S) content allowed within 200 nautical miles of coastal areas (\"global emission control areas\") to 0.5% or 0.1% (5000 or 1000 ppm S, respectively) results in a distinctive reduction in near surface sulfate from shipping in coastal regions compared with the year 2002. The model results also show that if emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) remain unabated, a reduction of the fuel sulfur content favors a strong increase in aerosol nitrate (NO3) which could counteract up to 20% of the decrease in sulfate mass achieved by sulfur emission reductions. The most important impact of shipping on the radiation budget is related to the modification of low maritime stratus clouds resulting in an increased reflectivity and enhanced shortwave cloud forcing. The direct aerosol effect from shipping is small. Our study shows that one can expect a less negative (less cooling) radiative forcing due to reductions in the current fuel sulfur content of ocean-going ships.

In 2011, EU researchers found that life expectancy could be extended four to nine times by reducing a unit of BC, vs reducing a unit of PM2.5. Only recently could such determinations be made. Steady improvements in research methodologies now enable such judgments. In this Critical Review, we survey epidemiological and toxicological literature regarding carbonaceous combustion emissions, as research methodologies improved over time. Initially, we focus on studies of BC, diesel, and traffic emissions in the Western countries (where daily urban BC emissions are mainly from diesels). We examine effects of other carbonaceous emissions, e.g., residential burning of biomass and coal without controls, mainly in developing countries. Throughout the 1990s, air pollution epidemiology studies rarely included species not routinely monitored. As additional PM2.5. chemical species, including carbonaceous species, became more widely available after 1999, they were gradually included in epidemiological studies. Pollutant species concentrations which more accurately reflected subject exposure also improved models. Natural \u201cinterventions\u201d - reductions in emissions concurrent with fuel changes or increased combustion efficiency; introduction of ventilation in highway tunnels; implementation of electronic toll payment systems \u2013 demonstrated health benefits of reducing specific carbon emissions. Toxicology studies provided plausible biological mechanisms by which different PM species, e.g., carbonaceous species, may cause harm, aiding interpretation of epidemiological studies. Our review finds that BC from various sources appears to be causally involved in all-cause, lung cancer, and cardiovascular mortality, morbidity, and perhaps adverse birth and nervous system effects. We recommend that the U.S. EPA rubric for judging possible causality of PM2.5. mass concentrations, be used to assess which PM2.5. species are most harmful to public health. Implications: Black carbon (BC) and correlated co-emissions appear causally related with all-cause, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality, and perhaps with adverse birth outcomes and central nervous system effects. Such findings are recent, since widespread monitoring for BC is also recent. Helpful epidemiological advances (using many health relevant PM2.5 species in models; using better measurements of subject exposure) have also occurred. \u201cNatural intervention\u201d studies also demonstrate harm from partly combusted carbonaceous emissions.

We determine part-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emission ratios by collecting material substitution data and evaluating that alongside known mass-based GHG ratios (using and updating Argonne National Laboratory's GREET model) associated with material pair substitutions. Several vehicle parts are lightweighted via material substitution, using substitution ratios from a U.S. Department of Energy report, to determine GHG emissions. We then examine fuel-cycle GHG reductions from lightweighting.

GHG breakeven values are derived for both driving distance and material substitution ratio. While material substitution can reduce vehicle weight, it often increases vehicle-cycle GHGs. It is likely that replacing steel (the dominant vehicle material) with wrought aluminum, carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CRFP), or magnesium will increase vehicle-cycle GHGs. However, lifetime fuel economy benefits often outweigh the vehicle-cycle, resulting in a net total life-cycle GHG benefit.

This option has not gained much momentum in global change research, however, possibly due to limited understanding of why low pH interferes with N2O reductase. We hypothesized that the reason is that denitrifying organisms in soils are unable to assemble functional N2O reductase (N2OR) at low pH, as shown to be the case for the model strain Paracoccus denitrificans. We tested this by experiments with bacteria extracted from soils by density gradient centrifugation. The soils were sampled from a long-term liming experiment (soil pH 4.0, 6.1, and 8.0). The cells were incubated (stirred batches, He atmosphere) at pH levels ranging from 5.7 to 7.6, while gas kinetics (NO, N2O, and N2) and abundances of relevant denitrification genes (nirS, nirK, and nosZ) and their transcripts were monitored. Cells from the most acidic soil (pH 4.0) were unable to reduce N2O at any pH. These results warrant a closer inspection of denitrification communities of very acidic soils. Cells from the neutral soils were unable to produce functional N2OR at pH values of \u22646.1, despite significant transcription of the nosZ gene. The N2OR expressed successfully at pH 7.0, however, was functional over the entire pH range tested (5.7 to 7.6). These observations lend strong support to our hypothesis: low soil pH diminishes/prevents reduction of N2O, primarily by precluding a successful assembly of functional N2O reductase. IMPORTANCE Impaired N2O reduction in acid soils was first observed ~60 years ago, and the phenomenon has been rediscovered several times since then. The practical implication would be that the emissions of N2O from cropped soils could be controlled by soil pH management, but this option has largely been ignored till now. One reason for this could be that the mechanisms involved have remained obscure. Here, we provide compelling evidence that the primary reason is that low pH interferes with the making of the enzyme N2O reductase rather than the function of the enzyme if properly assembled. The implications are important for understanding how pH controls the kinetics of N2O and N2 production by denitrification. The improved understanding provides credibility for soil pH management as a way to mitigate N2O emissions.

Understanding the variability in enteric methane production related to diet is essential to decreasing uncertainty in greenhouse gas emission inventories and to identifying viable greenhouse gas reduction strategies. Our study focused on measuring methane in growing beef cattle fed corn- or barley-based diets typical of those fed to cattle in North American feedlots. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block (group) design with two treatments, barley and corn. Angus heifer calves (initial BW = 328 kg) were allocated to two groups (eight per group), with four cattle in each group fed a corn or barley diet. The experiment was conducted over a 42-d backgrounding phase, a 35-d transition phase and a 32-d finishing phase. Backgrounding diets consisted of 70% barley silage or corn silage and 30% concentrate containing steam-rolled barley or dry-rolled corn (DM basis). Finishing diets consisted of 9% barley silage and 91% concentrate containing barley or corn (DM basis). All diets contained monensin (33 mg/kg of DM). Cattle were placed into four large environmental chambers (two heifers per chamber) during each phase to measure enteric methane production for 3 d. During the backgrounding phase, DMI was greater by cattle fed corn than for those fed barley (10.2 vs. 7.6 kg/d, P < 0.01), but during the finishing phase, DMI was similar for both diets (8.3 kg/d). The DMI was decreased to 6.3 kg/d with no effect of diet or phase while the cattle were in the chambers; thus, methane emissions (g/d) reported may underestimate those of the feedlot industry. Methane emissions per kilogram of DMI and as a percentage of GE intake were not affected by grain source during the backgrounding phase (24.6 g/kg of DMI; 7.42% of GE), but were less (P < 0.05) for corn than for barley during the finishing phase (9.2 vs. 13.1 g/kg of DMI; 2.81 vs. 4.03% of GE).

The model underestimates concentrations of isoprene, HCHO, and HONO. The impact of this discrepancy on the question of NOx versus VOC limitation of the ozone production is discussed. According to the model, reduction of the NOx emissions is more effective in reducing O3 than reduction of the VOC emissions for a large fraction of the area under investigation.

The southern part of Switzerland is often impacted by a plume originating from Milan, which leads to additional ozone at the measuring site. We used the model to simulate the influence of this plume on the chemical regime. The plume emissions are picked up by the model at two different times. Both cases deliver the same concentrations for the end point of the calculations. If the emissions are picked up early in the morning, the ozone production becomes VOC sensitive for a few hours before switching back to being NOx sensitive.

Both total GHG and GHG emissions per unit of product decrease as productivity increases. Limitations of previous studies on GHG emissions are that they generally describe feed intake inadequately, assess the consequences of selection on particular traits only, or examine consequences for only part of the production chain. Here, we examine GHG emissions for the whole production chain, with the estimated cost of carbon included as an extra cost on traits in the breeding objective of the production system.MethodsWe examined an example beef production system where economic merit was measured from weaning to slaughter. The estimated cost of the carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-e) associated with feed intake change is included in the economic values calculated for the breeding objective traits and comes in addition to the cost of the feed associated with trait change. GHG emission effects on the production system are accumulated over the breeding objective traits, and the reduction in GHG emissions is evaluated, for different carbon prices, both for the individual animal and the production system.ResultsMultiple-trait selection in beef cattle can reduce total GHG and GHG emissions per unit of product while increasing economic performance if the cost of feed in the breeding objective is high. When carbon price was $10, $20, $30 and $40/ton CO2-e, selection decreased total GHG emissions by 1.1, 1.6, 2.1 and 2.6% per generation, respectively. When the cost of feed for the breeding objective was low, selection reduced total GHG emissions only if carbon price was high (~\u2009$80/ton CO2-e). Ignoring the costs of GHG emissions when feed cost was low substantially increased emissions (e.g. 4.4% per generation or\u2009~\u20098.8% in 10\u00a0years).ConclusionsThe ability to reduce GHG emissions in beef cattle depends on the cost of feed in the breeding objective of the production system. Multiple-trait selection will reduce emissions, while improving economic performance, if the cost of feed in the breeding objective is high. If it is low, greater growth will be favoured, leading to an increase in GHG emissions that may be undesirable.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "9a21a4814057f1353f468c5d56621cfffc3573cc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2106113905", "DOI": "10.1016/S0926-3373(02)00207-2", "CorpusId": 97909522}, "title": "Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by catalytic processes", "abstract": null, "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "a8d20ea320ae9b8655cdd205c2b9285b604ebcdd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1863478089", "CorpusId": 127979321}, "title": "Blue Carbon : The Role of Healthy Oceans in Binding carbon.

Parallel SIP using dsrAB (encoding subunit A and B of the dissimilatory (bi)sulfite reductase) identified no additional sulfate reducers under the conditions tested. For the identified Desulfosporosinus species a high cell-specific sulfate reduction rate of up to 341\u2009fmol SO42\u2212\u2009cell\u22121\u2009day\u22121 was estimated. Thus, the small Desulfosporosinus population has the potential to reduce sulfate in situ at a rate of 4.0\u201336.8\u2009nmol (g soil w. wt.)\u22121\u2009day\u22121, sufficient to account for a considerable part of sulfate reduction in the peat soil. Modeling of sulfate diffusion to such highly active cells identified no limitation in sulfate supply even at bulk concentrations as low as 10\u2009\u03bcM. Collectively, these data show that the identified Desulfosporosinus species, despite being a member of the \u2018rare biosphere\u2019, contributes to an important biogeochemical process that diverts the carbon flow in peatlands from methane to CO2 and, thus, alters their contribution to global warming.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "9fe1911404a61a252900d859968d124db50a5030", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2621049071", "DOI": "10.3390/SU9060929", "CorpusId": 7055826}, "title": "Pilot-Scale Testing of Non-Activated Biochar for Swine Manure Treatment and Mitigation of Ammonia, Hydrogen Sulfide, Odorous Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), and Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "abstract": "Managing the environmental impacts associated with livestock production is a challenge for farmers, public and regulatory agencies.

Policies to control air quality focus on mitigating emissions of aerosols and their precursors, and other short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs). On a local scale, these policies will have beneficial impacts on health and crop yields, by reducing particulate matter (PM) and surface ozone concentrations; however, the climate impacts of reducing emissions of SLCPs are less straightforward to predict. In this paper we consider a set of idealized, extreme mitigation strategies, in which the total anthropogenic emissions of individual SLCP emissions species are removed. This provides an upper bound on the potential climate impacts of such air quality strategies. We focus on evaluating the climate responses to changes in anthropogenic emissions of aerosol precursor species: black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC) and sulphur dioxide (SO2). We perform climate integrations with four fully coupled atmosphere\u2013ocean global climate models (AOGCMs), and examine the effects on global and regional climate of removing the total land-based anthropogenic emissions of each of the three aerosol precursor species. We find that the SO2 emissions reductions lead to the strongest response, with all models showing an increase in surface temperature focussed in the Northern Hemisphere mid and (especially) high latitudes, and showing a corresponding increase in global mean precipitation. Changes in precipitation patterns are driven mostly by a northward shift in the ITCZ (Intertropical Convergence Zone), consistent with the hemispherically asymmetric warming pattern driven by the emissions changes. The BC and OC emissions reductions give a much weaker response, and there is some disagreement between models in the sign of the climate responses to these perturbations. These differences between models are due largely to natural variability in sea-ice extent, circulation patterns and cloud changes. This large natural variability component to the signal when the ocean circulation and sea-ice are free-running means that the BC and OC mitigation measures do not necessarily lead to a discernible climate response.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "f69284d69a0f3986f225889459c7feab57567aaa", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2288671910", "DOI": "10.1017/S1355770X0200027X", "CorpusId": 154761762}, "title": "Technology transfers in the Clean Development Mechanism: an incentives issue", "abstract": "The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) offers abatement cost savings under the Kyoto Protocol by allowing credits for emission reductions obtained in signatory developing countries.

The design of modern gas turbine burners requires delicate compromises between fuel efficiency, emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and combustion stability. Burner designs allowing substantial NOx reduction are often prone to combustion oscillations. These oscillations also change the NOx fields. Being able to predict not only the main species field in a burner but also the pollutant and the oscillation levels is now a major challenge for combustion modelling. This must include a realistic treatment of unsteady acoustic phenomena (which create instabilities) and also of heat transfer mechanisms (convection and radiation) which control NOx generation. In this work, large-eddy simulation (LES) is applied to a realistic gas turbine combustion chamber configuration where pure methane is injected through multiple holes in a cone-shaped burner. In addition to a non-reactive simulation, this article presents three reactive simulations and compares them to experimental results. The first reactive simulation neglects effects of cooling air on flame stabilization and heat losses by radiation and convection. The second reactive simulation shows how cooling air and heat transfer affect nitric oxide emissions. Finally, the third reactive simulation shows the effects of combustion instability on nitric oxide emissions. Additionally, the combustion instability is analysed in detail, including the evaluation of the terms in the acoustic energy equation and the identification of the mechanism driving the oscillation.

Rice cultivation and field management were similar in both paddy fields; however, one field had a subsurface drainage system installed 0.6\u20130.8 m below the soil surface (drained paddy field) and the other had no such system (non-drained paddy field). Methane emissions from the drained paddy field during each rice-growing season were approximately 71% lower than those from the non-drained paddy field. The subsurface drainage system lowered the groundwater level and top of the gley soil layer to the drainage pipe level, enhanced soil permeability, and resulted in more oxidized soil conditions in the fallow season. The lower total and hot water extractable carbon in the plowed layer soil of the drained field versus the non-drained field strongly suggests that the organic substrate that gives rise to CH4 decomposed more quickly in the drained field. Ferrous iron concentrations in the fresh plowed layer soil, collected from before submergence up to mid-summer drainage, were also much lower in the drained field. This indicated that ferrous iron produced during the flooding seasons was quickly oxidized to ferric iron in the fallow season, which then acted as an electron accepter and inhibited CH4 production in the subsequent rice-growing season. In contrast, the continuous reductive conditions in the non-drained field (even in the fallow season) prevented most of the ferrous iron from being oxidized. Therefore, installing a subsurface drainage system greatly reduced CH4 emissions by improving aerobic conditions and reducing CH4 production potential. Methane emissions with a large inter-annual variation in the rice-growing season from the non-drained field were positively correlated with soil moisture in the plowed layer before submergence, which, in turn, greatly affected CH4 emission in the following rice-growing season.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "612ef7784e2d8a7233ebc8d4eb4e21934ab8b3eb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1969042217", "DOI": "10.1039/c3dt51773j", "CorpusId": 205858980, "PubMed": "24100943"}, "title": "Yb3+ sensitized Er3+ doped La2O3 phosphor in temperature sensors and display devices.", "abstract": "The frequency upconversion emissions in the Er(3+)/Er(3+)-Yb(3+) doped/codoped hexagonal shaped La2O3 phosphor characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) upon excitation with 980 nm and 800 nm CW lasers have been investigated.

But as an instrument for achieving emissions reductions, it has failed 1. It has produced no demonstrable reductions in emissions or even in anticipated emissions growth. And it pays no more than token attention to the needs of societies to adapt to existing climate change. The impending United Nations Climate Change Conference being held in Bali in December \u2014 to decide international policy after 2012 \u2014 needs to radically rethink climate policy. Kyoto's supporters often blame non-signatory governments, especially the United States and Australia, for its woes. But the Kyoto Protocol was always the wrong tool for the nature of the job. Kyoto was constructed by quickly borrowing from past treaty regimes dealing with stratospheric ozone depletion, acid rain from sulphur emissions and nuclear weapons. Drawing on these plausible but partial analogies , Kyoto's architects assumed that climate change would be best attacked directly through global emissions controls, treating tonnes of carbon dioxide like stockpiles of nuclear weapons to be reduced via mutually verifiable targets and timetables. Unfortunately this borrowing simply failed to accommodate the complexity of the climate-change issue 2. Kyoto has failed in several ways, not just in its failure to slow global warming , but also because it has stifled discussion of alternative policy approaches that could both combat climate change and adapt to its unavoidable consequences. As Kyoto became a litmus test of political correctness, those who were concerned about climate change, but sceptical of the top\u2013down approach adopted by the Protocol were sternly admonished that \" Kyoto is the only game in town \". We are anxious that the same mistake is not repeated in the current round of negotiations. Already, in the post-Kyoto discussions, we are witnessing that well-documented human response to failure, especially where political or emotional capital is involved, which is to insist on more of what is not working: in this case more stringent targets and timetables, involving more countries. The next round of negotiations needs to open up new approaches, not to close them down as Kyoto did. Economic theory recognizes the futility of throwing good money after bad. In politics, however, sunk costs are often seen as political capital or as an investment of reputation and status.

Comparison of thallium scintigraphy with reinjection and PET imaging with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose.", "abstract": "In patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction, the distinction between ventricular dysfunction arising from myocardial fibrosis and ischemic, but viable, myocardium has important clinical implications. By positron emission tomography (PET), enhanced fluorine-18-labeled fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in myocardial segments with impaired function and reduced blood flow is evidence of myocardial viability. Reinjection of thallium-201 at rest immediately after stress-redistribution imaging may also provide evidence of myocardial viability by demonstrating thallium uptake in regions with apparently \"irreversible\" defects. To compare these two methods, we studied 16 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction (ejection fraction, 27 +/- 9%), all of whom had irreversible defects on standard exercise-redistribution thallium single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Thallium was reinjected immediately after the redistribution study, and SPECT images were reacquired. The patients also underwent PET imaging with FDG and oxygen-15-labeled water. A total of 432 myocardial segments were analyzed from comparable transaxial tomograms, of which 166 (38%) had irreversible thallium defects on redistribution images before reinjection. FDG uptake was demonstrated in 121 (73%) of these irreversible defects. Irreversible defects were then subgrouped according to the degree of thallium activity, relative to peak activity in normal regions. Irreversible defects with only mild (60-85% of peak activity) or moderate (50-59% of peak) reduction in thallium activity were considered viable on the basis of FDG uptake in 91% and 84% of these segments, respectively. In contrast, in irreversible defects with severe reduction in thallium activity (less than 50% of peak), FDG uptake was present in 51% of segments. In such severe defects, an identical number of segments (51%) demonstrated enhanced uptake of thallium after reinjection. In these severe \"irreversible\" defects, data on myocardial viability were concordant by the two techniques in 88% of segments, with 45% identified as viable and 43% identified as scar on both PET and thallium reinjection studies. These observations suggest that thallium imaging can be used to identify viable myocardium in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and left ventricular dysfunction. Most irreversible defects with only mild or moderate reduction in thallium activity represent viable myocardium as confirmed by FDG uptake.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "year": 1991}, {"paperId": "0687b8ef9520ede8ee0bd2bd1b9bf73be2861626", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1544226858", "DOI": "10.4271/2005-01-3763", "CorpusId": 108663096}, "title": "Effects of GTL fuel properties on DI diesel combustion", "abstract": "Reduction of vehicle exhaust emissions is an important contributor to improved air quality.

In this paper, the effects of distillation characteristics and cetane number of experimental GTL test fuels on direct injection (Dl) diesel combustion and exhaust emissions were investigated, together with their spray behaviour and mixing characteristics. The test results show that the lower distillation test fuels produce the largest reductions in smoke and PM emissions even at high cetane numbers. This is linked to the enhanced air/fuel mixing of the lighter fuel in a shorter time. The high ignitability and short ignition delay resulting from the high cetane number of all the GTL samples proved effective for reduction of unburnt emissions and combustion noise.

The National Emission Ceilings Directive 2016/2284/EU has set an obligation for all European Union countries to reduce the NH3 emissions by 6%, relative to 2005, by 2020. This study aims to assess the costs and benefits of four NH3 emission abatement options for the compliance of the agricultural sector with the commitments of the European air quality regulatory framework. A regional atmospheric model (WRF/Chem) was used to assess the effects of regulating NH3 emissions reductions on PM2.5 concentrations over Europe. Non-market valuation techniques (value of statistical life) were used to monetize the associated health outcomes.ResultsWe calculated that 16 out of the 28 EU member states exceeded their 2020 NH3 emission ceilings in 2016. The highest exceedances from the 2020 emission commitment level occurred in Latvia (15%), Germany (12%) and the UK (12%). Simulation of the required NH3 emission reduction by WRF/Chem showed that relatively large reductions in PM2.5 concentrations occur over central-western Europe and the UK. The largest health benefits (>\u20095% reduction in premature mortality) were found for Scandinavia. The economic benefit from avoided premature deaths over Europe amounts to 14,837\u00a0M\u20ac/year. The costs of four NH3 emission abatement options, where each would fully achieve the required emission reduction, range from 80\u00a0M\u20ac/year for low nitrogen feed to 3738\u00a0M\u20ac/year for low-emission animal housing, with covered manure storage (236\u00a0M\u20ac/year) and urea fertilizer application (253\u00a0M\u20ac/year), in between.ConclusionOur analysis indicates that the costs of compliance by the agricultural sector with the commitments of the European air quality regulations are much lower than the economic benefit. Thus, much more ambitious reduction commitments for NH3 emissions could be applied by the EU-28.

Delayed free recall was assessed once the emission scan was complete.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES\nThe HOMA-IR value was calculated using fasting glucose and insulin values obtained during OGTT screening and then correlated with CMRglu values obtained during the resting scan. Resting CMRglu values were also subtracted from CMRglu values obtained during the memory encoding activation scan to examine task-related patterns of CMRglu.\n\n\nRESULTS\nGreater insulin resistance was associated with an AD-like pattern of reduced CMRglu in frontal, parietotemporal, and cingulate regions in adults with PD/T2D. The relationship between CMRglu and HOMA-IR was independent of age, 2-hour OGTT glucose concentration, or apolipoprotein E \u03b54 allele carriage. During the memory encoding task, healthy adults showed activation in right anterior and inferior prefrontal cortices, right inferior temporal cortex, and medial and posterior cingulate regions. Adults with PD/T2D showed a qualitatively different pattern during the memory encoding task, characterized by more diffuse and extensive activation, and recalled fewer items on the delayed memory test.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nInsulin resistance may be a marker of AD risk that is associated with reduced CMRglu and subtle cognitive impairments at the earliest stage of disease, even before the onset of mild cognitive impairment.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "0ca00944a49fad907434de19c3368fb5f04c868e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2808690993", "DOI": "10.1016/J.APENERGY.2018.06.044", "CorpusId": 115364267}, "title": "Potential of energy savings and CO2 emission reduction in China\u2019s iron and steel industry", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "09b9f1a31204d92c86f4be77389abb2555d70f23", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2994520226", "DOI": "10.1093/OXREP/19.3.362", "CorpusId": 73577918}, "title": "The Social Cost of Carbon and its Policy Implications", "abstract": "The shadow price, or 'social cost', of carbon is an important indicator of the global incremental damage done by emitting greenhouse gases today. Cost--benefit analysis would set the optimal amount of greenhouse-gas-emission reduction at the point where this social cost just equals the incremental cost of controlling emissions. The higher the value for the social cost of carbon, the more control is warranted. This comparison assumes that cost--benefit analysis is the correct way of determining climate-change policy, and many believe this is not the case because of the very long-term, irreversible, and potentially catastrophic nature of global warming. But, in the short run at least, a comparison of cost and benefits is required, and, in any event, all decisions imply costs and benefits. But what is the 'right' figure for the social cost of carbon? This paper reviews the UK government's assessment of the cost and concludes that it has been set far too high because of a misreading of the integrated assessment models used to balance costs and benefits. Moreover, adoption of the UK government's shadow price would have formidable implications for energy policy in the UK, and for policies on afforestation.

They are hazardous air pollutants that lead to the formation of acid rain and tropospheric ozone. Both pollutants are usually present simultaneously and are, therefore, called NOx. Another compound is N2O which is found in the stratosphere where it plays a role in the greenhouse effect. Concern for environmental and health issues coupled with stringent NOx emission standards generates a need for the development of efficient low-cost NOx abatement technologies. Under such circumstances, it becomes mandatory for each NOx-emitting industry or facility to opt for proper NOx control measures. Several techniques are available to control NOx emissions: selective catalytic reduction (SCR), selective non-catalytic reduction (SNCR), adsorption, scrubbing, and biological methods. Each process offers specific advantages and limitations. Since bioprocesses present many advantages over conventional technologies for flue gas cleaning, a lot of interest has recently been shown for these processes. This article reviews the major characteristics of conventional non-biological technologies and recent advances in the biological removal of NOx from flue gases based on the catalytic activity of either eucaryotes or procaryotes, ie nitrification, denitrification, the use of microalgae, and a combined physicochemical and biological process (BioDeNOx). Relatively uncomplicated design and simple operation and maintenance requirements make biological removal a good option for the control of NOx emissions in stationary sources.

The revised model simulates rice growth by tracking photosynthesis, respiration, C allocation, tillering, and release of organic C and O2 from roots. For anaerobic soil processes, it quantifies the production of electron donors [H2 and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)] by decomposition and rice root exudation, and simulates CH4 production and other reductive reactions based on the availability of electron donors and acceptors (NO3\u2212, Mn4+, Fe3+, and SO42\u2212). Methane emission through rice is simulated by a diffusion routine based on the conductance of tillers and the CH4 concentration in soil water. The revised DNDC was tested against observations at three rice paddy sites in Japan and China with varying rice residue management and fertilization, and produced estimates consistent with observations for the variation in CH4 emission as a function of residue management. It also successfully predicted the negative effect of (NH4)2SO4 on CH4 emission, which the current model missed. Predicted CH4 emission was highly sensitive to the content of reducible soil Fe3+, which is the dominant electron acceptor in anaerobic soils.

An optimal technical solution to set baselines would be to use historical average figures during the time period from 1990 to 2005. The system introduces two different schemes to account for preserved carbon: one for countries with high forest conversion rates where the desired outcome would be a reduction in their rates, and another for countries with low rates. A \u2018global\u2019 baseline rate would be used to discriminate between these two country categories (high and low rates). For the hypothetical accounting period 2013\u20132017 and considering 72% of the total tropical forest domain for which data are available, the scenario of a 10% reduction of the high rates and of the preservation of low rates would result in approximately 1.6 billion tCO2 of avoided emissions. The resulting benefits of this reduction would be shared between those high-rate countries which reduced deforestation and those low-rate countries which did not increase their deforestation over an agreed threshold (e.g., half of \u201cglobal\u201d baseline rate).", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "b3c2a919121877ed658cc3ae2cc50a798bcbd5e9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2111149652", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-15-13849-2015", "CorpusId": 18339776}, "title": "Effects of global change during the 21st century on the nitrogen cycle", "abstract": "Abstract. The global nitrogen (N) cycle at the beginning of the 21st century has been shown to be strongly influenced by the inputs of reactive nitrogen (Nr) from human activities, including combustion-related NOx, industrial and agricultural N fixation, estimated to be 220 Tg N yr\u22121 in 2010, which is approximately equal to the sum of biological N fixation in unmanaged terrestrial and marine ecosystems. According to current projections, changes in climate and land use during the 21st century will increase both biological and anthropogenic fixation, bringing the total to approximately 600 Tg N yr\u22121 by around 2100. The fraction contributed directly by human activities is unlikely to increase substantially if increases in nitrogen use efficiency in agriculture are achieved and control measures on combustion-related emissions implemented. Some N-cycling processes emerge as particularly sensitive to climate change. One of the largest responses to climate in the processing of Nr is the emission to the atmosphere of NH3, which is estimated to increase from 65 Tg N yr\u22121 in 2008 to 93 Tg N yr\u22121 in 2100 assuming a change in global surface temperature of 5 \u00b0C in the absence of increased anthropogenic activity. With changes in emissions in response to increased demand for animal products the combined effect would be to increase NH3 emissions to 135 Tg N yr\u22121. Another major change is the effect of climate changes on aerosol composition and specifically the increased sublimation of NH4NO3 close to the ground to form HNO3 and NH3 in a warmer climate, which deposit more rapidly to terrestrial surfaces than aerosols. Inorganic aerosols over the polluted regions especially in Europe and North America were dominated by (NH4)2SO4 in the 1970s to 1980s, and large reductions in emissions of SO2 have removed most of the SO42\u2212 from the atmosphere in these regions. Inorganic aerosols from anthropogenic emissions are now dominated by NH4NO3, a volatile aerosol which contributes substantially to PM10 and human health effects globally as well as eutrophication and climate effects. The volatility of NH4NO3 and rapid dry deposition of the vapour phase dissociation products, HNO3 and NH3, is estimated to be reducing the transport distances, deposition footprints and inter-country exchange of Nr in these regions. There have been important policy initiatives on components of the global N cycle. These have been regional or country-based and have delivered substantial reductions of inputs of Nr to sensitive soils, waters and the atmosphere. To date there have been no attempts to develop a global strategy to regulate human inputs to the nitrogen cycle. However, considering the magnitude of global Nr use, potential future increases, and the very large leakage of Nr in many forms to soils, waters and the atmosphere, international action is required. Current legislation will not deliver the scale of reductions globally for recovery from the effects of Nr deposition on sensitive ecosystems, or a decline in N2O emissions to the global atmosphere. Such changes would require substantial improvements in nitrogen use efficiency across the global economy combined with optimization of transport and food consumption patterns. This would allow reductions in Nr use, inputs to the atmosphere and deposition to sensitive ecosystems. Such changes would offer substantial economic and environmental co-benefits which could help motivate the necessary actions.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "f01df932b772d27fd6fd1916cfeb6baeed1d22cc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2117750632", "DOI": "10.1126/SCIENCE.287.5455.1014", "CorpusId": 23540363, "PubMed": "10669407"}, "title": "Observation of antiferromagnetic domains in epitaxial thin films", "abstract": "Antiferromagnetic domains in an epitaxial thin film, LaFeO(3) on SrTiO(3)(100), were observed using a high-spatial-resolution photoelectron emission microscope with contrast generated by the large x-ray magnetic linear dichroism effect at the multiplet-split L edge of Fe.

The 10- to 12-fold multilateral increase in resolution below the diffraction barrier has been enabled by the elimination of molecular triplet state excitation as a major source of photobleaching of a number of dyes in stimulated emission depletion microscopy. Allowing for relaxation of the triplet state between subsequent excitation-depletion cycles yields an up to 30-fold increase in total fluorescence signal as compared with reported stimulated emission depletion illumination schemes. Moreover, it enables the reduction of the effective focal spot area by up to approximately 140-fold below that given by diffraction. Triplet-state relaxation can be realized either by reducing the repetition rate of pulsed lasers or by increasing the scanning speed such that the build-up of the triplet state is effectively prevented. This resolution in immunofluorescence imaging is evidenced by revealing nanoscale protein patterns on endosomes, the punctuated structures of intermediate filaments in neurons, and nuclear protein speckles in mammalian cells with conventional optics.

This paper analyzes a set of social processes which influence who benefits from reductions in emissions generated by primary production from forest ecosystems.

We illustrate this argument by examining three ongoing carbon-forestry projects in China, Ecuador, and Mexico and we highlight its implications for future forestry mitigation projects and programmes.", "year": 2010}]}
