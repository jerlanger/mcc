Data from volcano-monitoring studies constitute the only scientifically valid basis for short-term forecasts of a future eruption, or of possible changes during an ongoing eruption. Thus, in any effective hazards-mitigation program, a basic strategy in reducing volcano risk is the initiation or augmentation of volcano monitoring at historically active volcanoes and also at geologically young, but presently dormant, volcanoes with potential for reactivation. Beginning with the 1980s, substantial progress in volcano-monitoring techniques and networks \u2013 ground-based as well space-based \u2013 has been achieved. Although some geochemical monitoring techniques (e.g., remote measurement of volcanic gas emissions) are being increasingly applied and show considerable promise, seismic and geodetic methods to date remain the techniques of choice and are the most widely used. Availability of comprehensive volcano-monitoring data was a decisive factor in the successful scientific and governmental responses to the reawakening of Mount St. elens (Washington, USA) in 1980 and, more recently, to the powerful explosive eruptions at Mount Pinatubo (Luzon, Philippines) in 1991.

The experiments were performed at different temperatures of plant incubation, and using two bean cultivars. The main effect of temperature of plant incubation was in disease development. There was no significant difference between cultivars in relation to disease development and in magnitude of physiological alterations when disease severity was the same for each cultivar. These diseases reduced the net photosynthetic rate and increased the dark respiration of infected leaves after the appearance of visible symptoms and the differences between healthy and diseased leaves increased with disease development. The transpiration rate and stomatal conductance were stable during the monocycle of rust, however, these two variables decreased in leaves with angular leaf spot and anthracnose beginning with symptom appearance and continuing until lesion development was complete. Carboxylation resistance was probably the main factor related to reduction of photosynthetic rate of the apparently healthy area of leaves with rust and angular leaf spot. Reduction of the intercellular concentration of CO 2 , due to higher stomatal resistance, was probably the main factor for leaves with anthracnose. Chlorophyll fluorescence assessments suggested that there was no change in electron transport capacity and generation of ATP and NADPH in apparently healthy areas of diseased leaves, but decreases in chlorophyll fluorescence emission occurred on visibly lesioned areas for all diseases. Minimal fluorescence was remarkably reduced in leaves with angular leaf spot. Maximal fluorescence and optimal quantum yield of photosystem II of leaves were reduced for all three diseases. Bean rust, caused by a biotrophic pathogen, induced less damage to the regulation mechanisms of the physiological processes of the remaining green area of diseased leaves than did bean angular leaf spot or anthracnose, caused by hemibiotrophic pathogens.

Increases in reactive nitrogen and hydrogen that lead to additional chemical ozone destruction mainly play a role in scenarios with higher GHG emissions.

However, model simulations were able to accurately represent both the long-term decadal surface concentrations of particle sulfate and nitrate and an episode in early 2003 of substantially elevated nitrate measured across the UK by the AGANet network. The latter was identified as consisting of three separate episodes, each of less than 1 month duration, in February, March and April. The primary cause of the elevated nitrate levels across the UK was meteorological: a persistent high-pressure system, whose varying location impacted the relative importance of transboundary versus domestic emissions. Whilst long-range transport dominated the elevated nitrate in February, in contrast it was domestic emissions that mainly contributed to the March episode, and for the April episode both domestic emissions and long-range transport contributed. A prolonged episode such as the one in early 2003 can have substantial impact on annual average concentrations. The episode led to annual concentration differences at the regional scale of similar magnitude to those driven by long-term changes in precursor emissions over the full decade investigated here. The results demonstrate that a substantial part of the UK, particularly the south and southeast, may be close to or exceeding annual mean limit values because of import of inorganic aerosol components from continental Europe under specific conditions.

The MAGIC model has been systematically calibrated to 12 sites in the UK, which form part of the UK Acid Waters Monitoring Network, using best available data. The model successfully simulates observed changes in major ions and acid neutralising capacity over the period 1988 to 2000. Predictions for the future are made assuming no further emission reductions from present day (constant deposition at current level) compared to reduced sulphur and nitrogen emission agreed under the Gothenburg Protocol (reduced sulphur dioxide emission by c.80%, nitrogen oxides by c.45% and ammonia by 20% by 2010). In addition, uncertainty in our understanding of future nitrogen dynamics is assessed using \"best\" and \"worst\" cases of nitrogen leaching in the model. The results clearly indicate the need to achieve further emission reductions in sulphur and nitrogen beyond present day levels to prevent continued surface water acidification. The predictions further indicate that if the emission reductions agreed under the Gothenburg Protocol are achieved by 2010 this will promote a recovery in acid neutralising capacity by 2020 at all sites. Differences between \"best\" and \"worst\" case nitrate leaching are relatively small, emphasising the need to achieve the sulphur reductions in the shorter term.

We describe an assimilation system for atmospheric methane (CH4), CarbonTracker-CH4, and demonstrate the diagnostic value of global or zonally averaged CH4 abundances for evaluating the results. We show that CarbonTracker-CH4 is able to simulate the observed zonal average mole fractions and capture inter-annual variability in emissions quite well at high northern latitudes (53\u201390\u00b0 N). In contrast, CarbonTracker-CH4 is less successful in the tropics where there are few observations and therefore misses significant variability and is more influenced by prior flux estimates. CarbonTracker-CH4 estimates of total fluxes at high northern latitudes are about 81 \u00b1 7 Tg CH4 yr\u22121, about 12 Tg CH4 yr\u22121 (13%) lower than prior estimates, a result that is consistent with other atmospheric inversions. Emissions from European wetlands are decreased by 30%, a result consistent with previous work by Bergamaschi et al. (2005); however, unlike their results, emissions from wetlands in boreal Eurasia are increased relative to the prior estimate. Although CarbonTracker-CH4 does not estimate an increasing trend in emissions from high northern latitudes for 2000 through 2010, significant inter-annual variability in high northern latitude fluxes is recovered. Exceptionally warm growing season temperatures in the Arctic occurred in 2007, a year that was also anonymously wet. Estimated emissions from natural sources were greater than the decadal average by 4.4 \u00b1 3.8 Tg CH4 yr\u22121 in 2007. CarbonTracker-CH4 estimates for temperate latitudes are only slightly increased over prior estimates, but about 10 Tg CH4 yr\u22121 is redistributed from Asia to North America. This difference exceeds the estimated uncertainty for North America (\u00b13.5 Tg CH4 yr\u22121). We used time invariant prior flux estimates, so for the period from 2000 to 2006, when the growth rate of global atmospheric CH4 was very small, the assimilation does not produce increases in natural or anthropogenic emissions in contrast to bottom-up emission data sets. After 2006, when atmospheric CH4 began its recent increases, CarbonTracker-CH4 allocates some of the increases to anthropogenic emissions at temperate latitudes, and some to tropical wetland emissions. For temperate North America the prior flux increases by about 4 Tg CH4 yr\u22121 during winter when biogenic emissions are small. Examination of the residuals at some North American observation sites suggests that increased gas and oil exploration may play a role since sites near fossil fuel production are particularly hard for the inversion to fit and the prior flux estimates at these sites are apparently lower and lower over time than what the atmospheric measurements imply. The tropics are not currently well resolved by CarbonTracker-CH4 due to sparse observational coverage and a short assimilation window. However, there is a small uncertainty reduction and posterior emissions are about 18% higher than prior estimates. Most of this increase is allocated to tropical South America rather than being distributed among the global tropics. Our estimates for this source region are about 32 \u00b1 4 Tg CH4 yr\u22121, in good agreement with the analysis of Melack et al.

This critique shows that the options for reducing CO2 emissions through energy demand reduction and energy supply shifts are much broader than those considered by Manne and Richels in the initial run of their model. The possibilities are so diverse with both present and future technologies, that the minimum CO2 emissions constraint penalty estimated by Mann and Richels may well prove to be too high - and the possibility of a negative penalty cannot be ruled out. Marine and Richels are correct in arguing that a vigorous R&D program is needed to keep economic consumption losses associated with constraints on CO2 emissions at low levels, and that waiting for clarification of the scientific issues relating to the greenhouse warning before launching such R&D efforts would be unwise, but the priorities for R&D implicit in the initial nun of their model are much too narrowly focused.

We comprehensively characterized intermediate volatility and semivolatile organic compound emissions using thermal desorption two-dimensional gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry with electron impact (GC \u00d7 GC-EI-MS) and vacuum-ultraviolet (GC \u00d7 GC-VUV-MS) ionization.

Since the late 1970s though, a significant 30% decline in Greenland sulfate firn levels can be documented. The maximum anthropogenic increase in northern Greenland sulfate firn concentrations (up to 200\u2013230 ppb) is 2\u20133 times larger than in southern and central Greenland. Nitrate records show an essentially steady increase since 1950 and, documented for the first time, a slight reduction during most recent years. Maximum nitrate firn levels of 100\u2013130 ppb exceed the preindustrial background by 100% all over the Greenland ice sheet. Comparison with anthropogenic SO2 and NOx emission records indicates that the major increase in sulfate firn concentrations since 1950 can be attributed to Eurasian sources, while firn levels during the first half of this century appear to be dominated by North American emissions. A stronger North American source contribution is indicated over the entire 20th century in the case of nitrate. Applying a macroscopic deposition model separate time series for wet and dry deposition were derived which revealed a close correspondence of wet deposited sulfate with the timing of U.S. emissions, while the temporal evolution of Eurasian emissions is mainly reflected in the dry sulfate deposition record.

We have used positron emission tomography to investigate in humans the role of dopamine (DA) and the brain circuits it regulates in these processes. We have shown that increases in DA are associated with the subjective reports of drug reinforcement corroborating the relevance of drug-induced DA increases in the rewarding effects of drugs in humans. During withdrawal we have shown in drug abusers significant reductions in DA D2 receptors and in DA release. We postulate that this hypodopaminergic state would result in a decreased sensitivity to natural reinforcers perpetuating the use of the drug as a means to compensate for this deficit and contributing to the anhedonia and dysphoria seen during withdrawal. Because the D2 reductions are associated with decreased activity in the anterior cingulate gyrus and in the orbitofrontal cortex we postulate that this is one of the mechanisms by which DA disruption leads to compulsive drug administration and the lack of control over drug intake in the drug-addicted individual. This is supported by studies showing that during craving these frontal regions become hyperactive in proportion to the intensity of the craving. Craving is also associated with activation of memory circuits including the amygdala (implicated in conditioned learning), hippocampus (implicated in declarative learning), and dorsal striatum (implicated in habit learning) all of which receive DA innervation. We therefore postulate that dopamine contributes to addiction by disrupting the frontal cortical circuits that regulate motivation, drive, and self-control and by memory circuits that increase the motivational salience of the drug and drug-associated stimuli.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "4cae4b176365e5302742b9b8da025da8b8a89934", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2317230596", "DOI": "10.1177/0954407015586896", "CorpusId": 113012906}, "title": "Fuel-efficient exhaust thermal management using cylinder throttling via intake valve closing timing modulation", "abstract": "Most diesel engines meet today\u2019s strict NOx and particulate matter emission regulations using after-treatment systems. A major drawback of these after-treatment systems is that they are efficient in reducing emissions only when their catalyst temperature is within a certain range (typically between 250 \u2009\u00b0C and 450\u2009\u00b0C). At lower engine loads this is a major problem as the exhaust temperatures are usually below 250\u2009\u00b0C.

The effect of cylinder throttling on exhaust gas temperatures, fuel consumption, in-cylinder combustion and emissions is outlined. A significant increase in turbine outlet temperature accompanied by a decrease in fuel consumption, NOx, and particulate matter emissions was observed. Both delayed and advanced intake valve closure timings were equally effective. The increase in exhaust gas temperatures was attributed to a drop in air flow through the engine, which resulted from a reduction in the volumetric efficiency via cylinder throttling. The increase in fuel efficiency resulted from a decrease in the pumping work through a reduction in air flow through the engine. Reductions in NOx are attributed to the combined effect of a lower in-cylinder temperature due to a reduction in piston-motion-induced compression and a shift to a more premixed combustion mode. Particulate matter emissions were also reduced as a result of additional premixing. At the 1200 RPM and 2.5 bar brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) operating point, both delayed and advanced intake valve closure timings resulted in a turbine outlet temperature increase from 195\u2009\u00b0C to 255\u2009\u00b0C accompanied by an increase in brake thermal efficiency of 1.5% (absolute) and a reduction in brake-specific NOx and particulate matter emissions by 40% and 30%, respectively.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "2dcfd120cf3e97b4e72e3c01a100569d5fe98148", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2127834494", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.00983.x", "CorpusId": 85743730}, "title": "Oxygen effects on methane production and oxidation in humid tropical forest soils", "abstract": "We investigated the effects of oxygen (O2) concentration on methane (CH4) production and oxidation in two humid tropical forests that differ in long\u2010term, time\u2010averaged soil O2 concentrations. We identified sources and sinks of CH4 through the analysis of soil gas concentrations, surface emissions, and carbon isotope measurements. Isotope mass balance models were used to calculate the fraction of CH4 oxidized in situ. Complementary laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the effects of O2 concentration on gross and net rates of methanogenesis. Field and laboratory experiments indicated that high levels of CH4 production occurred in soils that contained between 9\u00b11.1% and 19\u00b10.2% O2. For example, we observed CH4 concentrations in excess of 3% in soils with 9\u00b11.1% O2.

Gross CH4 production was probably greater than flux measurements indicated, as isotope mass balance calculations suggested that 48\u201378% of the CH4 produced was oxidized prior to atmospheric egress. O2 availability influenced CH4 oxidation more strongly than methanogenesis. Gross CH4 production was relatively insensitive to O2 concentrations in laboratory experiments. In contrast, methanotrophic bacteria oxidized a greater fraction of total CH4 production with increasing O2 concentration, shifting the \u03b413C composition of CH4 to values that were more positive.

With this extension, the GAINS (GHG-Air pollution INteraction and Synergies) model will allow the assessment of emission control costs for the six greenhouse gases covered under the Kyoto Protocol (CO2, CH4, N2O and the three F-gases) together with the emissions of air pollutants SO2, NOx, VOC, NH3 and PM. This report describes the first implementation (Version 1.0) of the model extension model to incorporate N2O emissions. \n \nGAINS Version 1.0 assesses the options for reducing N2O emissions emissions from the various source categories. It quantifies for 43 countries/regions in Europe country-specific application potentials of the various options in the different sectors of the economy, and estimates the societal resource costs of these measures. Mitigation potentials are estimated in relation to an exogenous baseline projection that is considered to reflect current planning. \n \nIn Europe, emissions from soils are generally considered the most important source of N2O, followed by industrial process emissions. Formation of nitrous oxide in soil is triggered by the availability of nitrogen. A number of emission controls directed at other pollutants (e.g., NOx or CH4) have positive or negative impacts on N2O emissions. Some of the earlier projections of N2O emissions have not taken full account of these interactions. Recent information on technological changes (e.g., for some technological processes) indicates a significant decline in N2O emissions in the past years, especially from adipic and nitric acid production. \n \nCatalytic reduction of N2O from industrial processes (adipic and nitric acid production), optimizing sewage treatment, modifications in fluidized bed combustion, and reduction of fertilizer application in agriculture can reduce N2O at moderate costs. Current legislation in EU countries addresses only some of these measures, which leaves an additional potential for further mitigation. However, the remaining mitigation potential is associated with high or even excessive costs. N2O emissions from non-agricultural soils induced from the atmospheric deposition of NOx and NH3, though of clearly anthropogenic origin, have not been counted as anthropogenic emissions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) methodology.

Two methods of quantifying PM were employed: conventional filters and a Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM). A partial flow micro-dilution tunnel was used to dilute the sampled exhaust to make the PM and aldehyde measurements. The work was performed at the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Test Center's (ATC) climate controlled chamber. ATC performed 37 tests on five class-8 trucks (model years ranging from 1992 to 2001). One was equipped with an 11 hp diesel auxiliary power unit (APU), and another with a diesel direct-fired heater (DFH). The APU powers electrical accessories, heating, and air conditioning, whereas a DFH heats the cab in cold weather. Both devices offer an alternative to extended truck-engine idling. Exhaust emission measurements were also made for the APU and DFH. Trucks were idled at a high and low engine speed in the following environments: 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) with cabin air conditioning on, \u221218 \u00b0C (0 \u00b0F) with the cabin heater on, and 18 \u00b0C (65 \u00b0F) with no accessories on. ATC test technicians adjusted the air conditioning or heater to maintain a target cabin temperature of 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F). Each test was run for approximately three hours. Comparison of the results from the APU to those from the idling trucks implies that use of an APU to replace truck idling gives fuel savings (and CO2 reduction) on the order of 60-85%, 50-97% reductions in NOx, CO and HC, and PM reductions of -20% to 95%. PM emissions from the APU were higher than the \u201cbest\u201d idling truck engine cases. The diesel-fired heater had significantly lower emissions and fuel consumption than the APU. The potential for fuel savings and environmental benefits are readily apparent. Results for PM emissions showed a wide range of emissions rates from <1 g/hr to over 20 g/hr, with the newest trucks in the 1-5 g/hr range. PM emissions generally decreased with an increase in ambient temperature and increased disproportionately with an increase in engine speed. Aldehyde mass emissions rate increased with both decreasing temperature and increasing engine speed. The mass emissions rate of regulated gaseous species generally increased with increasing engine speed.

In this article, we evaluate the impact of revised local densities of interacting WD binaries on future GW observations. Specifically, we consider five scenarios that explain these densities with different assumptions on the formation of interacting systems; we simulate corresponding populations of detached and interacting WD binaries; we estimate the number of individually detectable GW sources and the magnitude of the confusion-noise foreground, as observed by space-based detectors with 5 and 1 Mkm arms. We confirm earlier estimates of thousands of detached-binary detections, but project only a few ten to a few hundred detections of interacting systems. This reduction is partly due to our assessment of detection prospects, based on the iterative identification and subtraction of bright sources with respect to both instrument and confusion noise.

Different species, decomposition, energy conservation, and maintenance scenarios were evaluated to determine how these factors influence the net carbon impact of urban forests and their management.

This prediction requires the accurate simulation of complex, highly non-linear and irreversible processes including the mechanics of rock deformation and failure due to coal mining and the consequent water flow and gas desorption and flow.This paper describes a three-dimensional numerical model, called COSFLOW. It uses a Cosserat continuum approach for the efficient description of mechanical stress changes and deformation in weak layered rock, typical of coal measures. This mechanical model is coupled with a two-phase dual porosity fluid flow model to describe flow of water and gas through porous rock, desorption/adsorption of gas from the matrix and subsequent flow of water and gas through the fracture network. The coupling includes simulation of permeability and porosity changes with rock deformation.The numerical model is used to simulate water inflow and gas emission in two Australian mines. The model is calibrated using existing extensive mine water inflow and gas emission measurements and used to make predictions for future longwall panels. Comparisons of numerical predictions with later mine measurements of water inflow and gas emission demonstrate the suitability of such a code in accurately predicting mine water inflow and gas emission into a coal mine.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "be4a398fd6124901f03989639c45e3e1bc4db924", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2971807556", "DOI": "10.5194/acp-19-11303-2019", "CorpusId": 202879486}, "title": "Assessing the impact of clean air action on air quality trends in Beijing using a machine learning technique", "abstract": "Abstract. A 5-year Clean Air Action Plan was implemented in 2013 to reduce air\npollutant emissions and improve ambient air quality in Beijing. Assessment\nof this action plan is an essential part of the decision-making process to\nreview its efficacy and to develop new policies. Both\nstatistical and chemical transport modelling have been previously applied to\nassess the efficacy of this action plan. However, inherent uncertainties in\nthese methods mean that new and independent methods are required to support\nthe assessment process. Here, we applied a machine-learning-based random\nforest technique to quantify the effectiveness of Beijing's action plan by\ndecoupling the impact of meteorology on ambient air quality. Our results\ndemonstrate that meteorological conditions have an important impact on the\nyear-to-year variations in ambient air quality. Further analyses show that\nthe PM2.5 mass concentration would have broken the target of the plan\n(2017 annual PM2.5<60\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123) were it not for the\nmeteorological conditions in winter 2017 favouring the dispersion of air\npollutants. However, over the whole period (2013\u20132017), the primary\nemission controls required by the action plan have led to significant\nreductions in PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO from 2013 to 2017 of approximately 34\u2009%, 24\u2009%, 17\u2009%, 68\u2009%, and 33\u2009%, respectively, after meteorological correction. The marked decrease in PM2.5 and SO2 is largely attributable to a reduction in coal\ncombustion. Our results indicate that the action plan has been highly\neffective in reducing the primary pollution emissions and improving air\nquality in Beijing. The action plan offers a successful example for\ndeveloping air quality policies in other regions of China and other\ndeveloping countries.\n", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "6ff3b29572b343591bc4bd0347921941befe0968", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2056253956", "DOI": "10.1002/EJIC.200700534", "CorpusId": 97405367}, "title": "Crystal Structure, Electrochemical and Optical Properties of [Au9(PPh3)8](NO3)3", "abstract": "The single-crystal structure of [Au9(PPh3)8](NO3)3 was resolved for the first time with atomic resolution.

We estimate the additional transient surface warming \u0394Ts caused by a potential reduction of marine dimethyl sulfide (DMS) production due to ocean acidification under the high-emission scenario RCP8.5 until the year 2200. Since we use a fully coupled Earth system model, our results include a range of feedbacks, such as the response of marine DMS production to the additional changes in temperature and sea ice cover. Our results are broadly consistent with the findings of a previous study that employed an offline model set-up. Assuming a medium (strong) sensitivity of DMS production to pH, we find an additional transient global warming of 0.30\u202fK (0.47\u202fK) towards the end of the 22nd century when DMS emissions are reduced by 7.3\u202fTg\u202fS\u202fyr\u22121 or 31\u202f% (11.5\u202fTg\u202fS\u202fyr\u22121 or 48\u202f%). The main mechanism behind the additional warming is a reduction of cloud albedo, but a change in shortwave radiative fluxes under clear-sky conditions due to reduced sulfate aerosol load also contributes significantly. We find an approximately linear relationship between reduction of DMS emissions and changes in top of the atmosphere radiative fluxes as well as changes in surface temperature for the range of DMS emissions considered here. For example, global average Ts changes by \u22120.\u2009041\u202fK per 1\u202fTg\u202fS\u202fyr\u22121 change in sea\u2013air DMS fluxes. The additional warming in our model has a pronounced asymmetry between northern and southern high latitudes. It is largest over the Antarctic continent, where the additional temperature increase of 0.56\u202fK (0.89\u202fK) is almost twice the global average. We find that feedbacks are small on the global scale due to opposing regional contributions. The most pronounced feedback is found for the Southern Ocean, where we estimate that the additional climate change enhances sea\u2013air DMS fluxes by about 9\u202f% (15\u202f%), which counteracts the reduction due to ocean acidification.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "2736de051219a5e9d73600366ea1e8010a957e3f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2944735555", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.2192517", "CorpusId": 3618925}, "title": "Can Uncertainty Justify Overlapping Policy Instruments to Mitigate Emissions?", "abstract": "This article constitutes a new contribution to the analysis of overlapping instruments to cover the same emission sources.

Our analysis has both a practical and a theoretical purpose.

Although ruminants have a unique advantage of being able to consume forages and graze lands not suitable for arable cropping, 2% to 12% of the gross energy consumed is converted to enteric CH4 during ruminal digestion, which contributes approximately 6% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, ruminant producers need to find cost-effective ways to reduce emissions while meeting consumer demand for food. This paper provides a critical review of the substantial amount of ruminant CH4-related research published in past decades, highlighting hydrogen flow in the rumen, the microbiome associated with methanogenesis, current and future prospects for CH4 mitigation and insights into future challenges for science, governments, farmers and associated industries. Methane emission intensity, measured as emissions per unit of meat and milk, has continuously declined over the past decades due to improvements in production efficiency and animal performance, and this trend is expected to continue. However, continued decline in emission intensity will likely be insufficient to offset the rising emissions from increasing demand for animal protein. Thus, decreases in both emission intensity (g CH4/animal product) and absolute emissions (g CH4/day) are needed if the ruminant industries continue to grow. Providing producers with cost-effective options for decreasing CH4 emissions is therefore imperative, yet few cost-effective approaches are currently available. Future abatement may be achieved through animal genetics, vaccine development, early life programming, diet formulation, use of alternative hydrogen sinks, chemical inhibitors and fermentation modifiers. Individually, these strategies are expected to have moderate effects (<20% decrease), with the exception of the experimental inhibitor 3-nitrooxypropanol for which decreases in CH4 have consistently been greater (20% to 40% decrease). Therefore, it will be necessary to combine strategies to attain the sizable reduction in CH4 needed, but further research is required to determine whether combining anti-methanogenic strategies will have consistent additive effects. It is also not clear whether a decrease in CH4 production leads to consistent improved animal performance, information that will be necessary for adoption by producers. Major constraints for decreasing global enteric CH4 emissions from ruminants are continued expansion of the industry, the cost of mitigation, the difficulty of applying mitigation strategies to grazing ruminants, the inconsistent effects on animal performance and the paucity of information on animal health, reproduction, product quality, cost-benefit, safety and consumer acceptance.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "28c07c99eb958ca61a27b32d613fe997870cac9a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2001161836", "DOI": "10.1021/EF049837W", "CorpusId": 96111206}, "title": "High Efficiency Co-production of Synthetic Natural Gas (SNG) and Fischer\u2212Tropsch (FT) Transportation Fuels from Biomass", "abstract": "The technical, economic, and ecological feasibility of the co-production of 50 PJ of Fischer\u2212Tropsch (FT) transportation liquids per year and 150 PJ of synthetic natural gas (SNG) per year (i.e., 10% of the 2001 Dutch consumption) has been studied.

Our results showed that the half-life of DCD in these laboratory incubating soils at 25\u00b0C was 6\u201315 days and was longer at the higher rate of DCD application. Of the 3 soils studied, DCD degradation was fastest in the brown loam allophanic soil (Typic orthic allophanic) and slowest in the silt loam non-allophanic soil (Argillic-fragic Perch-gley Pallic). The differences in DCD degradation among these soils can be attributed to the differences in the adsorption of DCD and in the microbial activities of the soils. Among the 3 soils the highest reduction in N2O emissions with DCD from the urine application was measured in the non-allophanic silt loam soil followed by non-allophanic sandy loam soil and allophanic brown loam soil.

In the present study, we determined the effect of short (four drainages of 5-6 days each) and long drainage cycles (two drainages of 10-11 days each) on CH(4) emission and analyzed the response of the structure and abundance of methanogens and methanotrophs in a Chinese rice field soil at the DNA level. Rice biomass production was similar between drainage and the practice of continuous flooding. The rate of CH(4) emission, however, was reduced by 59% and 85% for the long and short drainage cycles, respectively. Quantitative (real-time) PCR analysis revealed that the total abundance of archaeal populations decreased by 40% after multiple drainages, indicating the inhibitory effects on methanogen growth. The structure of the methanogen community as determined by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, however, remained unaffected by drainages, although it varied among rhizosphere, bulk and surface soils. Quantitative PCR analysis of the methanotrophic functional pmoA genes revealed that the total abundance of methanotrophs in rhizosphere soil increased two to three times after soil drainages, indicating a stimulation of methanotroph growth. The CH(4) oxidation potential in the rhizosphere soil also increased significantly. Furthermore, drainages caused a shift of the methanotrophic community, with a significantly increase of type II methanotrophic bacteria in the rhizosphere and surface soil. Thus, both inhibition of methanogens and stimulation of methanotrophs were partly responsible for the reduction of CH(4) emissions.

The model is employed to explore the full range of climate change implications of the successful development of cost effective, advanced, energy technologies. These technologies are shown to have a profound effect on the future magnitude and rate of anthropogenic climate change. We find that the introduction of assumptions developed by a group of \u2018bottom-up\u2019 modelers for the LEESS scenarios into a \u2018top-down\u2019 model, the Edmonds-Reilly-Barns Model, leads to \u2018top down\u2019 emissions trajectories similar to those of the LEESS. The cumulative effect of advanced energy technologies is to reduce annual emissions from fossil fuel use to levels which stabilize atmospheric concentrations below 550 ppmv. While all energy technologies play roles, the introduction of advanced biomass energy production technology is particularly important. The consideration of all greenhouse related anthropogenic emissions, and in particular sulfur dioxide, is found to be important. We find that the consideration of sulfur dioxide emissions coupled to rapid reductions in carbon dioxide emissions leads to higher global mean temperatures prior to 2050 than in the reference case. This result is due to the short-term cooling impact of sulfate aerosols, which dominates the long-term warming impact of CO2 and CH4 in the years prior to 2050. We also show that damage calculations which use only mean global temperature and income may be underestimating damages by up to a factor of five. Disaggregating income reduces this to a factor of two, still a major error.

Even with a step up in mitigation, the goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 \u00b0C remains challenging. Consequences of missing these goals are substantial, especially on regional scales. Because progress in the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions has been slow, climate engineering schemes are increasingly being discussed. But global schemes remain controversial and have important shortcomings. A reduction of global mean temperature through global-scale management of solar radiation could lead to strong regional disparities and affect rainfall patterns. On the other hand, active management of land radiative effects on a regional scale represents an alternative option of climate engineering that has been little discussed. Regional land radiative management could help to counteract warming, in particular hot extremes in densely populated and important agricultural regions. Regional land radiative management also raises some ethical issues, and its efficacy would be limited in time and space, depending on crop growing periods and constraints on agricultural management. But through its more regional focus and reliance on tested techniques, regional land radiative management avoids some of the main shortcomings associated with global radiation management. We argue that albedo-related climate benefits of land management should be considered more prominently when assessing regional-scale climate adaptation and mitigation as well as ecosystem services.Land management with the aim of reducing incoming solar radiation could help with regional-scale climate adaptation and mitigation as well as ecosystem services, and avoids several shortcomings of global geoengineering.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "6bf3677b0d59d16ff9314fdde4f0ce9443f7f298", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "4754487", "MAG": "2308282903", "DOI": "10.3389/fpls.2016.00090", "CorpusId": 2073738, "PubMed": "26909084"}, "title": "Effects of Silver Nanoparticles on Radish Sprouts: Root Growth Reduction and Modifications in the Nutritional Value", "abstract": "Reports indicate that silver nanoparticles (nAg) are toxic to vegetation, but little is known about their effects in crop plants.

A typical episode with elevated ozone over eastern China from 12 to 16 August 2001 was investigated by using a tropospheric chemistry and transport model (TCTM), driven by a non-hydrostatic mesoscale model MM5. The meteorological conditions during this period were characterized by high-pressure systems associated with low wind speeds, high temperatures and clear skies. Afternoon ozone concentrations exceeding 80 parts per billion (ppb) occurred over broad areas of eastern China. There is a generally good agreement between simulation and observation, indicating that the TCTM is able to represent major physical and chemical processes of tropospheric ozone and well reproduce the diurnal and day-to-day variability associated with synoptic conditions. The sensitivity analysis reveals a significant influence of biogenic hydrocarbons on regional ozone. Ozone levels are apparently enhanced by biogenic emission over large areas of eastern China. The largest increase up to 30 ppb in daytime average concentration is found in portions of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Yangtze Delta and northeast China. However, the response of ozone to biogenic emission varies spatially, showing more sensitivity in polluted areas than that in clean rural areas. The regimes limited by nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic carbon (VOC) in eastern China are further investigated with respect to biogenic emission. Ozone shows a clear tendency to shift from VOC limitation to NOx limitation as it moves from urban and industrial areas to rural areas. Most of the rural areas in southern China tend to be NOx limited, whereas most of the northern parts of China appear to be VOC limited. By considering biogenic emission, ozone tends to become more NOx limited and less VOC limited, both in extent and intensity, over eastern china.

Emissions of SOX are currently being reduced significantly in many places by wet scrubbing of the exhaust or flue gases, but most of the NOX in the flue gases is NO, which is so insoluble that it is virtually impossible to scrub. Consequently, NOX control is mostly achieved by using combustion modifications to limit the formation of NOX, or by using chemical reduction techniques to reduce NOX to N2. Low NOX burners are relatively inexpensive but can only achieve about 50% reduction in NOX emissions; selective catalytic reduction (SCR) can achieve high reductions but is very expensive. The removal of NOX in wet scrubbers could be greatly enhanced by gas-phase oxidation of the NO to NO2, HNO2, and HNO3 (the acid gases are much more soluble in water than NO). This oxidation is accomplished by injecting liquid hydrogen peroxide into the flue gas; the H2O2 vaporizes and dissociates into hydroxyl radicals. The active OH radicals then oxidize the NO and NO2. This NOX control technique might prove economically feasible at power plants with existing SO2 scrubbers. The higher chemical costs for H2O2 would be balanced by the investment cost savings, compared with an alternative such as SCR. The oxidation of NOX by using hydrogen peroxide has been demonstrated in a laboratory quartz tube reactor. NO conversions of 97% and 75% were achieved at hydrogen peroxide/NO mole ratios of 2.6 and 1.6, respectively.

In the 15-day incubation with glucose, fly ash application at a variety rates from 2 to 15\u00a0% (w/w) reduced CO2 emission by 3.6 to 21.4\u00a0% for normal and by 19.8 to 30.3\u00a0% for saline soil compared to the control without fly ash. For saline soil, the reduction in CO2 emission was attributed primarily to inhibition of microbial respiration by fly ash; however, for normal soil in which suppression of microbial respiration by fly ash was not apparent, carbonation was believed to play an important role in reduction of CO2 emission.ConclusionsTherefore, fly ash may be helpful in reducing CO2 emission from normal soils via carbonation. For saline soil, however, fly ash needs to be carefully considered as a soil amendment to reduce CO2 emission as it can inhibit soil microbial activities and thus degrade soil quality.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "325b497f82456dc676df8d7642e26a85b48eb17f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2035291410", "DOI": "10.1007/S10784-008-9088-0", "CorpusId": 154162172}, "title": "A review of the CDM literature: from fine-tuning to critical scrutiny?", "abstract": "As negotiations on the post-2012 climate regime are now taking off, it is time to look back and assess the experiences of the clean development mechanism (CDM) to this date.

Optimal IOP as well as blend ratio was determined for maximum efficiency and minimum emission values. Further, a novel pipe in pipe counter flow heat exchanger was designed and fabricated to arrange for preheating the raw mahua oil with exhaust gases of the engine. MOME was also prepared and tested as fuel in engine. Characterisation for major properties of all test fuels was conducted. Performance and emission characteristics of the diesel engine for raw mahua oil blends (unheated) at both rated and optimal IOP were compared with those of diesel, MOME and preheated raw mahua oil. At IOP of 226\u00a0bar, maximum brake thermal efficiency was obtained for M10, M20 and M30 blends. Significant reduction in carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emission were observed. Nitrogen oxides emissions increased marginally. It was also observed that preheated mahua oil as fuel increases efficiency and reduces emissions.

The aim of this paper is to compare within each animal category the odour emission of a number of swine housing systems and poultry housing systems. Emission measurements including 17 housing systems were carried out at 24 livestock facilities. Results showed that investigated systems with low ammonia emission for fattening pigs and sows were significantly (p<0.025) lower than conventional systems, being 50%, or more, lower. For laying hens and broilers, housing systems with low ammonia emission showed odour emissions that in most cases only differed slightly from conventional systems. Correlations between ammonia and odour concentration (within facilities) did not show a consistent pattern.

However, because of the limitations in resource, knowledge and technical capabilities, most SMEs are confronting environmental issues such as the negative spillovers. The policy costs of an administrative order that is effective to promote emission reductions of large enterprises in China\u2019s current economy could be high, and therefore, it is essential and crucial to establish a market-driven mechanism to help and encourage SMEs to make environmental improvement regarding the cap-and-trade system. In this context, new patterns of emission reduction would have profound impacts on knowledge management (KM) of SMEs, especially on knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we adopt a micro-model to study the behaviors and carbon emissions of SMEs under different scenarios. We find that both trading and sharing of knowledge on carbon emission reduction are conducive to reducing emissions of SMEs in the context of cap-and-trade. Besides, the more the compensation is granted, the more manufacturing firms are willing to share knowledge with partners who have complementary knowledge. Subsidies or rewards on knowledge sharing can be helpful to reduce carbon emission, which may have important implications for public policy to solve the problem of carbon emission reduction of SMEs.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "3f7604f9a064762181e8222d76196741b038d21e", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "6346386", "MAG": "2904315193", "DOI": "10.1021/acscentsci.8b00734", "CorpusId": 59303512, "PubMed": "30693331"}, "title": "High-Performance N2-to-NH3 Conversion Electrocatalyzed by Mo2C Nanorod", "abstract": "The synthesis of NH3 is mainly dominated by the traditional energy-consuming Haber\u2013Bosch process with a mass of CO2 emission.

Such an assessment is currently relevant in view of UNFCCC?s decision to replace the values currently used. An emission metric determines the relative weights of non-CO2 greenhouse gases in obtaining CO2-equivalent emissions. For the first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol, the UNFCCC has used 100 year global warming potential (GWP) values as reported in IPCC?s Second Assessment Report. For the second commitment period, the UNFCCC has decided to use 100 year GWP values from IPCC?s Fourth Assessment Report. We find that such a change has only a minor impact on (the optimal timing of) global emission reductions and costs. However, using 20 year or 500 year GWPs to value non-CO2 greenhouse gases does result in a significant change in both costs and emission reductions in our model. CO2 reductions are favored over non-CO2 gases when the time horizon of the GWPs is increased. Application of GWPs with time horizons longer than 100 year can increase abatement costs substantially, by about 20% for 500 year GWPs. Surprisingly, we find that implementation of a metric based on a time-dependent global temperature potential does not necessary lead to lower abatement costs. The crucial factor here is how fast non-CO2 emissions can be reduced; if this is limited, the delay in reducing methane emissions cannot be (fully) compensated for later in the century, which increases total abatement costs.", "year": 2015}]}
