The production of 1\u00a0t crude palm oil requires 5\u00a0t of fresh fruit bunches (FFB). On average, processing of 1\u00a0t FFB in palm oil mills generates 230\u00a0kg empty fruit bunches (EFB) and 650\u00a0kg palm oil mill effluent (POME) as residues. These residues cause considerable environmental burdens, particularly greenhouse gas emissions. In order to reduce those emissions, four waste management options are compared in the present study using 1,000\u00a0kg of FFB as functional unit.MethodsA detailed life cycle model has been used to calculate the environmental impacts of POME and EFB treatment. The options under investigation are: (1) dumping EFB and storing POME and ponds, (2) returning EFB to the plantation and POME as before, (3) using EFB and POME for co-composting and returning the produced compost to the plantation, (4) generating biogas from POME and thereafter as in (3). The CML 2001 method included in the GABI 4.3 software package has been used for the impact calculations. Sensitivity analysis has been carried out in order to estimate the influence of good and poor management practice on the environmental performance.Results and discussionThe main contributor to the GWP is methane from POME and EFB dumping. The GWP of palm oil mill waste treatment can be reduced from 245\u00a0kg CO2eq per ton FFB to up to 5\u00a0kg CO2eq per ton FFB due to reduced methane emissions and nutrient recycling. Co-composting of POME and EFB leads to considerable nutrient recovery, in addition to GWP reduction. Thus, the composting process reduces not only environmental burdens; it also leads to net environmental benefit regarding most environmental impact categories, e.g., acidification potential, eutrophication potential, ozone layer depletion potential, etc. due to the avoided emissions from inorganic fertilizer production. The recovery of nutrients in EFB can be achieved by solely returning it to the plantation, but only the combined treatment of EFB and POME allows nutrient recovery from POME while methane emissions from pond systems are avoided simultaneously. The fermentation of POME to produce biogas reduces environmental burdens when operating under best practice conditions. However, fugitive biogas emissions of more than 2% reverse that beneficial effect.Conclusion and recommendationA life-cycle-based comparison of conventional and advanced treatment systems for EFB and POME can support decision makers regarding waste treatment options and provide information on technology risks involved. The results of this study may be used as basic calculation data for clean development mechanism for palm oil mills. LCA is shown to be a powerful tool to estimate and compare environmental impacts of different options. Unfortunately, it is rarely used in the palm oil industry in order to improve or optimize palm oil production systems. This study has shown that nutrient recovery from POME and EFB offers considerable environmental and economic benefits to palm oil production systems. However, using EFB for energy production, as it is discussed and realized by some palm oil mills, prohibits environmental beneficial POME utilization. Best waste management practice reduces emissions at palm oil mills and consequently the carbon footprint of palm oil products. Co-composting of EFB and POME, with or without prefermentation of POME in a biogas plant, is a profitable way to use the nutrients from both POME and EFB.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "80c1b848625926d21d011c88d757d7608fa28955", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1958491524", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1467-9701.2012.01470.x", "CorpusId": 153561398}, "title": "Unilateral Climate Policy and Competitiveness: Economic Implications of Differential Emission Pricing", "abstract": "Unilateral emission reduction commitments raise concerns on international competitiveness and emission leakage that result in preferential regulatory treatment of domestic energy-intensive and trade-exposed industries. Our analysis illustrates the potential pitfalls of climate policy design which narrowly focuses on competitiveness concerns about energy-intensive and trade-exposed (EITE) branches. The sector-specific gains of preferential regulation in favour of these branches must be traded off against the additional burden imposed on other industries. Beyond burden shifting between industries, differential emission pricing bears the risk for substantial excess cost in emission reduction as policy concedes (too) low carbon prices to EITE industries and thereby foregoes relatively cheap abatement options in these sectors. From the perspective of global cost-effectiveness we find that differential emission pricing of EITE industries hardly reduces emission leakage since the latter is driven through robust international energy market responses to emission constraints. As a consequence the scope for efficiency compared to uniform pricing is very limited. Only towards stringent emission reduction targets will a moderate price differentiation achieve sufficient gains from leakage reduction to offset the losses of diverging marginal abatement cost.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "a3ceea13f22da1960e8a91abf9aa20c8d77bb693", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2046181287", "DOI": "10.1007/s13157-011-0205-4", "CorpusId": 22007546}, "title": "Potential Impacts of Climate Change on Groundwater Supplies to the Do\u00f1ana Wetland, Spain", "abstract": "Climate change impacts on natural recharge and groundwater-wetland dynamics were investigated for the Almonte-Marismas aquifer, Spain, which supports the internationally important Do\u00f1ana wetland.

Reductions in flow from the aquifer to streams and springs flooding the wetland, induced by changes in recharge according to different climate projections, were modelled.

This is generally overcome by constructing large facilities having satisfactory economies of scale, thus making financing onerous and hindering the development of suitable technologies. Lignol Innovations has developed a biorefining technology that employs an ethanol-based organosolv step to separate lignin, hemicellulose components, and extractives from the cellulosic fraction of woody biomass. The resultant cellulosic fraction is highly susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis, generating very high yields of glucose (>90% in 12\u201324h) with typical enzyme loadings of 10\u201320 FPU (filter paper units)/g. This glucose is readily converted to ethanol, or possibly other sugar platform chemicals, either by sequential or simultaneous saccharification and fermentation. The liquor from the organosolv step is processed by well-established unit operations to recover lignin, furfural, xylose, acetic acid, and a lipophylic extractives fraction. The process ethanol is recovered and recycled back to the process. The resulting recycled process water is of a very high quality, low BOD5, and suitable for overall system process closure. Significant benefits can be attained in greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, as per the Kyoto Protocol.

The results show that, if shipping emissions are assumed to increase at a rate of 2.5% per year, their relative contribution to sulphur deposition is expected to increase from 9% to 28% between 2002 and 2020. The model was compared to both a European scale and a global scale chemical transport model and found to give broad agreement with the magnitude and location of sulphur deposition associated with shipping emissions.

In this study we examined how mitigation through the reduction of the intensity of land management and through rewetting may affect the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and the C balance of intensively managed, drained, agricultural peatlands. Carbon and GHG balances were determined for three peatlands in the western part of the Netherlands from 2005 to 2008 by considering spatial and temporal variability of emissions (CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O). One area (Oukoop) is an intensively managed grass-on-peatland area, including a dairy farm, with the ground water level at an average annual depth of 0.55 (\u00b10.37) m below the soil surface. The second area (Stein) is an extensively managed grass-on-peatland area, formerly intensively managed, with a dynamic ground water level at an average annual depth of 0.45 (\u00b10.35) m below the soil surface. The third area is a (since 1998) rewetted former agricultural peatland (Horstermeer), close to Oukoop and Stein, with the average annual ground water level at a depth of 0.2 (\u00b10.20) m below the soil surface. During the measurement campaigns we found that both agriculturally managed sites acted as C and GHG sources and the rewetted former agricultural peatland acted as a C and GHG sink. The ecosystem (fields and ditches) total GHG balance, including CO 2 , CH 4 and N 2 O, amounted to 3.9 (\u00b10.4), 1.3 (\u00b10.5) and \u22121.7 (\u00b11.8) g CO 2 -eq m \u22122 d \u22121 for Oukoop, Stein and Horstermeer, respectively.

For Horstermeer the GHG balance remained the same since no farm-based emissions exist. Considering the C balance (uncertainty range 40\u201360%), the total C release in Oukoop and Stein is 5270 and 6258 kg C ha \u22121 yr \u22121 , respectively (including ecosystem and management fluxes), and the total C uptake in Horstermeer is 3538 kg C ha \u22121 yr \u22121 . Water bodies contributed significantly to the terrestrial GHG balance because of a high release of CH 4 . Overall, this study suggests that managed peatlands are large sources of GHGs and C, but, if appropriate measures are taken, they can be turned back into GHG and C sinks within 15 years of abandonment and rewetting. The shift from an intensively managed grass-on-peat area (Oukoop) to an extensively managed one (Stein) reduced the GHG emissions mainly because N 2 O emission and farm-based CH 4 emissions decreased.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "b453c21e1f87f3f4e5eb48d50aecd1623f13330d", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "3059989", "MAG": "2009447149", "DOI": "10.1289/ehp.1002233", "CorpusId": 7409892, "PubMed": "20947468"}, "title": "Global Climate Change and Children\u2019s Health: Threats and Strategies for Prevention", "abstract": "Background Global climate change will have multiple effects on human health.

However, recently environmental authorities in large urban centers have expressed their concerns on the true effect of using ethanol blends of up to 20% v/v in in-use vehicles without any modification in the setup of the engine control unit (ECU), and on the variations of these effects along the years of operation of these vehicles. Their main concern is the potential increase in the emissions of volatile organic compounds with high ozone formation potential. To address these concerns, we developed analytical and experimental work testing engines under steady-conditions. We also tested carbureted and fuel-injected vehicles every 10,000 km during their first 100,000 km of operation. We measured the effect of using ethanol-gasoline blends on the power and torque generated, the fuel consumption and CO2, CO, NOx and unburned hydrocarbon emissions, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs) such as acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, benzene and 1,3-butadiene which are considered important ozone precursors. The obtained results showed statistically no significant differences in these variables when vehicles operate with a blend of 20% v/v ethanol and 80% v/v gasoline (E20) instead of gasoline. Those results remained unchanged during the first 100,000 km of operation of the vehicles. We also observed that when the vehicles operated with E20 at high engine loads, they showed a tendency to operate with greater values of \u03bb (ratio of the actual air-fuel ratio to the stoichiometric air-fuel ratio) when compared to their operation with gasoline. According to the Eco-Indicator-99, these results represent a minor reduction (<1.3%) on the impact to human health, and on the deterioration of the ecosystem. However, it implies a 12.9% deterioration of the natural resources. Thermal equilibrium analysis, at the tailpipe conditions (~100 \u00b0C), showed that ethane, formaldehyde, ethylene and ethanol are the most relevant VOCs in terms of the amount of mass emitted.

Structural changes to livestock production and ample supply of cheap chemical fertilisers have decreased the interest and possibilities of farmers in using manure for the fertilisation of crops and grasslands and maintenance of soil fertility. As a result, many livestock producers dispose of manure as cheaply as possible causing serious pollution of soil, water and atmosphere. In addition, livestock production systems contribute to climate change by emission of the GHG carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O). Careful recycling of livestock manures to fertilise crops and grasslands and improve soil fertility is considered the most suitable and cost-effective option for environmentally friendly disposal. Manure management legislation in The Netherlands is described to explain the principles. These include complete collection of faeces and urine of confined livestock, adaptation of the period and rate of manure application to the N and P requirements of crops, and use of manure collection, storage and application techniques aiming at low ammonia (NH3) losses. Effects of sustainable manure management on GHG emissions are described. Optimising the period, rate and technique of manure application to crops and grassland causes effective utilisation of manure N and reduces direct and indirect losses of N2O. In addition, effective recycling of manure nutrients and OM allows a reduction in the use of chemical fertilisers and fossil energy and contributes to the maintenance or improvement of the carbon content of agricultural ecosystems. The relatively high costs of sustainable manure management stimulate farmers to optimise feed conversion and minimise manure production per unit of product by good livestock feeding and management practices. High feed conversion efficiency reduces CH4 emission by enteric fermentation and may reduce feed imports and related GHG emissions. In addition, it is shown that livestock categories differ widely in feed conversion efficiency and N and P excretion per unit of product. Finally, anaerobic digestion of livestock slurries provides a valuable energy source and reduces CH4 emission of stored slurry and, possibly, N2O emission after field application of the slurry.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "00b99d63a777da7c6e528d514ec2a22a3e74d6b3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2056117835", "DOI": "10.1109/3.299482", "CorpusId": 121120106}, "title": "Variation of intensity noise and frequency noise with the spontaneous emission factor in semiconductor lasers", "abstract": "The intensity noise level and the spectral line-width of semiconductor injection lasers are theoretically analyzed.

In recent years every effort was made to reduce DEE and their content of carcinogenic and mutagenic polycyclic aromatic compounds. Since 1995 we observed an appreciable reduction of mutagenicity of DEE driven by reformulated or newly designed fuels in several studies. Recently, the use of rapeseed oil as fuel for diesel engines is rapidly growing among German transportation businesses and agriculture due to economic reasons. We compared the mutagenic effects of DEE from two different batches of rapeseed oil (RSO) with rapeseed methyl ester (RME, biodiesel), natural gas derived synthetic fuel (gas-to-liquid, GTL), and a reference diesel fuel (DF). The test engine was a heavy-duty truck diesel running the European Stationary Cycle. Particulate matter from the exhaust was sampled onto PTFE-coated glass fibre filters and extracted with dichloromethane in a soxhlet apparatus. The gas phase constituents were sampled as condensates. The mutagenicity of the particle extracts and the condensates was tested using the Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian microsome assay with tester strains TA98 and TA100. Compared to DF the two RSO qualities significantly increased the mutagenic effects of the particle extracts by factors of 9.7 up to 59 in tester strain TA98 and of 5.4 up to 22.3 in tester strain TA100, respectively. The condensates of the RSO fuels caused an up to factor 13.5 stronger mutagenicity than the reference fuel. RME extracts had a moderate but significant higher mutagenic response in assays of TA98 with metabolic activation and TA100 without metabolic activation. GTL samples did not differ significantly from DF. In conclusion, the strong increase of mutagenicity using RSO as diesel fuel compared to the reference DF and other fuels causes deep concern on future usage of this biologic resource as a replacement of established diesel fuels.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "83eb5e8bab02dfc5ef75ec05c357da6cd4afb666", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2004389684", "DOI": "10.1039/AN9921701603", "CorpusId": 96272547}, "title": "Combined generator/separator.

The regression analysis shows that the sign of the relationship is positive when EMI is employed as measure of productivity growth; but not statistically different from zero when MI is applied.

First, global demand for hypothetical REDD credits is estimated. The demand for REDD credits would be highest with a base year of 1990, using gross\u2014net accounting. The key factors determining demand in this scenario are the emission reduction targets and the allowable cap. A proportion of emission reduction targets available for offsets lower than 15% would fail to generate a sufficient demand for REDD. Also examined is the option of financing REDD through a fund.

The main obstacle to the increased use of diesel engines in this platform is the upcoming extremely stringent, Tier 2 emission standard. In order to succeed, diesel vehicles must comply with emissions standards while maintaining their excellent fuel economy. The availability of technologies such as common rail fuel injection systems, low sulfur diesel fuel, NO x adsorber catalysts (NAC), and diesel particle filters (DPFs) allow the development of powertrain systems that have the potential to comply with these future requirements. In meeting the Tier 2 emissions standards, the heavy light-duty trucks (HLDTs) and medium-duty passenger vehicles (MDPVs) will face the greatest technological challenges. In support of this, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has engaged in several test projects under the Advanced Petroleum Based Fuels-Diesel Emission Control (APBF-DEC) activity. The primary technology being addressed by these projects is the sulfur tolerance of the NAC/DPF system and the durability implications of varying fuel sulfur levels. The test bed for one project in this activity is a 2500 series Chevrolet Silverado equipped with a 6.6L Duramax diesel engine certified to 2002 model year (MY) Federal heavy-duty and 2002 MY California medium-duty emission standards While NAC systems have demonstrated extremely high levels of NO x reduction in steady-state laboratory evaluations, the application of a NAC system to an actual transient engine application requires the development of an integrated engine/emissions management system [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

Perhaps the most promising geoengineering technique is stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), which reflects incoming solar radiation, thereby lowering surface temperatures. This paper analyzes a scenario in which SAI brings great harm on its own. The scenario is based on the issue of SAI intermittency, in which aerosol injection is halted, sending temperatures rapidly back toward where they would have been without SAI. The rapid temperature increase could be quite damaging, which in turn creates a strong incentive to avoid intermittency. In the scenario, a catastrophic societal collapse eliminates society\u2019s ability to continue SAI, despite the incentive. The collapse could be caused by a pandemic, nuclear war, or other global catastrophe. The ensuing intermittency hits a population that is already vulnerable from the initial collapse, making for a double catastrophe. While the outcomes of the double catastrophe are difficult to predict, plausible worst-case scenarios include human extinction. The decision to implement SAI is found to depend on whether global catastrophe is more likely from double catastrophe or from climate change alone. The SAI double catastrophe scenario also strengthens arguments for greenhouse gas emissions reductions and against SAI, as well as for building communities that could be self-sufficient during global catastrophes.

In particular, for OLEDs it is required to harvest all singlet and triplet excitons that are generated in the emission layer. This can be achieved using the so-called triplet harvesting mechanism. However, the materials to be applied are based on high-cost rare metals and therefore, it has been proposed already more than one decade ago by our group to use the effect of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) to harvest all generated excitons in the lowest excited singlet state S1 . In this situation, the resulting emission is an S1 \u2192S0 fluorescence, though a delayed one. Hence, this mechanism represents the singlet harvesting mechanism. Using this effect, high-cost and strong SOC-carrying rare metals are not required. This mechanism can very effectively be realized by use of CuI or AgI complexes and even by purely organic molecules. In this investigation, we focus on photoluminescence properties and on crucial requirements for designing CuI and AgI materials that exhibit short TADF decay times at high emission quantum yields. The decay times should be as short as possible to minimize non-radiative quenching and, in particular, chemical reactions that frequently occur in the excited state. Thus, a short TADF decay time can strongly increase the material's long-term stability. Here, we study crucial parameters and analyze their impact on the TADF decay time. For example, the energy separation \u0394E(S1 -T1 ) between the lowest excited singlet state S1 and the triplet state T1 should be small. Accordingly, we present detailed photophysical properties of two case-study materials designed to exhibit a large \u0394E(S1 -T1 ) value of 1000\u2005cm-1 (120\u2005meV) and, for comparison, a small one of 370\u2005cm-1 (46\u2005meV). From these studies-extended by investigations of many other CuI TADF compounds-we can conclude that just small \u0394E(S1 -T1 ) is not a sufficient requirement for short TADF decay times. High allowedness of the transition from the emitting S1 state to the electronic ground state S0 , expressed by the radiative rate kr (S1 \u2192S0 ) or the oscillator strength f(S1 \u2192S0 ), is also very important. However, mostly small \u0394E(S1 -T1 ) is related to small kr (S1 \u2192S0 ). This relation results from an experimental investigation of a large number of CuI complexes and basic quantum mechanical considerations. As a consequence, a reduction of \u03c4(TADF) to below a few \u03bcs might be problematic. However, new materials can be designed for which this disadvantage is not prevailing. A new TADF compound, Ag(dbp)(P2 -nCB) (with dbp=2,9-di-n-butyl-1,10-phenanthroline and P2 -nCB=bis-(diphenylphosphine)-nido-carborane) seems to represent such an example. Accordingly, this material shows TADF record properties, such as short TADF decay time at high emission quantum yield. These properties are based (i)\u2005on geometry optimizations of the AgI complex for a fast radiative S1 \u2192S0 rate and (ii)\u2005on restricting the extent of geometry reorganizations after excitation for reducing non-radiative relaxation and emission quenching.

However, it is proposed that the differences in the vulnerability of DPOAEs to high and low SPLs is a natural consequence of the way the cochlea responds to high and low SPLs. An active process boosts the basilar membrane (BM) vibrations, which are attenuated when the active process is impaired. However, at high SPLs the contribution of the active process to BM vibration is small compared with the dominating passive mechanical properties of the BM. Consequently, reduction of active cochlear amplification will have greatest effect on BM vibrations and DPOAEs at low SPLs. To distinguish between the \"two sources\" and the \"single source\" hypotheses we analyzed the level dependence of the notch and corresponding phase discontinuity in plots of DPOAE magnitude and phase as functions of the level of the primaries.

Yet, the confounding effect of meteorological variability hinders a reliable quantification of the lockdown's impact upon the observed pollution levels. Our study uses machine-learning (ML) models fed by meteorological data along with other time features to estimate the \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d NO2 mixing ratios that would have been observed in the absence of the lockdown. We then quantify the so-called meteorology-normalized NO2 reductions induced by the lockdown measures by comparing the estimated business-as-usual values with the observed NO2 mixing ratios. We applied this analysis for a selection of urban background and traffic stations covering the more than 50 Spanish provinces and islands. The ML predictive models were found to perform remarkably well in most locations, with an overall bias, root mean square error and correlation of +4 \u2009%, 29\u2009% and 0.86, respectively. During the period of study, from the enforcement of the state of alarm in Spain on 14\u00a0March to 23\u00a0April, we found the lockdown measures to be responsible for a 50\u2009% reduction in NO2 levels on average over all provinces and islands. The lockdown in Spain has gone through several phases with different levels of severity with respect to mobility restrictions. As expected, the meteorology-normalized change in NO2 was found to be stronger during phase II (the most stringent phase) and phase III of the lockdown than during phase I. In the largest agglomerations, where both urban background and traffic stations were available, a stronger meteorology-normalized NO2 change is highlighted at traffic stations compared with urban background sites. Our results are consistent with foreseen (although still uncertain) changes in anthropogenic emissions induced by the lockdown. We also show the importance of taking the meteorological variability into account for accurately assessing the impact of the lockdown on NO2 levels, in particular at fine spatial and temporal scales. Meteorology-normalized estimates such as those presented here are crucial to reliably quantify the health implications of the lockdown due to reduced air pollution.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "4b0ec34dea9d9fb428b91fd1440b298eb9ccf084", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1560134351", "DOI": "10.2172/10131971", "CorpusId": 108839306}, "title": "Use of the Edmonds-Reilly model to model energy-related greenhouse gas emissions", "abstract": "This paper forms part of an OECD project which addresses the issue of the costs of reducing CO2 emissions by comparing the results from six global models of a set of standardised reduction scenarios.

Much of this progress is attributable to reductions in pollutant emissions by motor vehicles, which have occurred despite sustained increases in car ownership and use. Lower emissions have resulted from tighter federal tailpipe emission standards for new cars and from federally-mandated changes in gasoline formulation. Declines in automobiles' emissions during on-road driving, however, have not kept pace with reductions in federal emissions standards for new cars; on-road emissions average four to ten times those of new cars under test conditions. The main causes of this difference are normal deterioration in new automobiles' emissions control systems as they age, differences between the carefully-controlled conditions used to measure new automobiles' emissions and those encountered in 'real-world driving', malfunctioning emissions control systems in a small fraction of cars, and evaporation of gasoline during refueling and from parked cars. Although most of the current debate over strategies to further reduce motor vehicle emissions remains focused on technologies to make new cars cleaner under test conditions, measures that reduce the gap between test and on-road emissions promise to be more effective.

To obtain these flame temperature reductions, while also maintaining acceptable combustor performance and operability at low engine power conditions, combustion process staging methods are needed. For use in advanced subsonic aircraft engines, combustors with leaner primary combustion zone fuel/air mixtures, together with combustion process staging features, are being developed. Significant NOx level reductions have been demonstrated with these advanced combustor design concepts. Although the resulting combustors are more complex than current technology combustors, satisfactory performance and operability appear attainable with these configurations. The initial introduction of these combustors into operational engines during the latter part of this decade is a likely prospect. In the case of advanced supersonic transport aircraft engines, combustors with ultralow NOx levels will probably be needed to prevent adverse impacts on the stratospheric ozone layer.

In contrast, this paper focuses on enhancements of the terrestrial 130.4-nm dayglow emission observed with DE 1. Following the onset of a geomagnetic storm at 1610 UT on February 5, 1983, an increase (>20%) in the O I 130.4-nm emission was observed at middle latitudes in the morning sector of the Southern Hemisphere. The increased O I 130.4-nm emission indicates an increase of atomic oxygen relative to molecular nitrogen. The brightness enhancement coincided with the passage of a large-scale gravity wave that was observed in measurements from a global network of ionosondes. The global FUV images and ionosonde observations are complemented by a TIMEGCM simulation of the February 1\u20136 period, which provides a framework for combining the ionosonde and DE 1 observations. The primary mechanisms for the FUV variations considered here are increases in the relative abundance of atomic oxygen in the morning sector caused by (1) the large-scale gravity wave launched by the onset of magnetic activity and (2) corotation of previously affected parcels onto the dayside.

This study addresses oversights of the related literature, which fails to capture several WDS elements and to provide detailed life-cycle inventories.

The main structural changes in PAGE2002 are the introduction of a third greenhouse gas and the incorporation of possible future large-scale discontinuities. The PAGE2002 model uses relatively simple equations to capture complex climatic and economic phenomena. This is justified because the results approximate those of the most complex climate simulations, and because all aspects of climate change are subject to profound uncertainty. To express the model results in terms of a single 'best guess' could be dangerously misleading. Instead, a range of possible outcomes should inform policy. PAGE2002 builds up probability distributions of results by representing 31 key inputs to the marginal impact calculations by probability distributions. In this investigation, PAGE2002 is run with global emissions of greenhouse gases from Scenario A2 of the IPCC. This scenario represents a heterogeneous world, with an underlying theme of self-reliance and preservation of local identities. As with all the IPCC illustrative scenarios, it assumes no active intervention to control emissions. The PAGE2002 mean results track the IPCC climate results very well. The range of results from the PAGE2002 model is larger than the range reported in the IPCC TAR. This is to be expected, as the IPCC results are simply the highest and lowest best guess results from the seven General Circulation Models considered by the IPCC, and not a true probability distribution. PAGE2002 gives the mean climate change impacts of scenario A2 over the next two centuries from 2000 to 2200 as US$26.3 trillion in year 2000 dollars, discounted back to 2000 at a pure time preference rate of 3% per year. The 5% and 95% points on the distribution are US$6.3 trillion and US$66.9 trillion. The marginal impact of each of the three gases, CO2, CH4 and SF6 is calculated by reducing the emissions of the gas by a small amount in the first analysis year, 2001, and finding the difference in impacts that this creates. The structure of the PAGE2002 model allows a probability distribution for the difference in impacts to be calculated. Market prices are about US$160 per tonne for methane and about US$25 000 per tonne for SF6. The climate change impacts of methane are a significant proportion of its market price. So a pipeline replacement to decrease losses could be justified if the Net Present Cost were less than about US$265 per tonne saved in 2000 US dollars - made up of not just US$160 from having the gas available to sell, but also US$105 from the reduction in climate change impacts. For SF6 the climate change impacts are much larger than the market price.

It expands the toolkit for achieving reductions in agricultural emissions, rewards technological advancement in both emission reductions and yields, and offers promise for addressing the problem of accounting for leakage.

An OBO approach might work best as a transitional strategy to address emissions from sectors or countries likely to remain outside a strict regulatory cap.

Autoradiographic methods that predict the glucose utilization rate from a single scan are unreliable in pathologic tissue because of abnormal values of the model rate constants. A normalization procedure using the ratio of measured tissue activity to activity calculated with standard rate constants is proposed to readjust the values of the rate constants. Reliable estimates of metabolic rates can be obtained from dynamic recordings of tracer uptake. In the graphic approach, metabolic rate can be derived from the slope of a segment of a transformed uptake curve, which becomes linear at 15\u201320 min after intravenous tracer injection, with an accuracy comparable with that in complete dynamic studies. However, by recording and analyzing full-length uptake curves, in addition to metabolic rate, the model rate constants can be determined regionally.

The drive to reduce energy use and associated greenhouse gas emissions from buildings has acted as a catalyst in the development of advanced computational methods for energy efficient design, management and control of buildings and systems. Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems are the major source of energy consumption in buildings and ideal candidates for substantial reductions in energy demand. Significant advances have been made in the past decades on the application of computational intelligence (CI) techniques for HVAC design, control, management, optimization, and fault detection and diagnosis. This article presents a comprehensive and critical review on the theory and applications of CI techniques for prediction, optimization, control and diagnosis of HVAC systems. The analysis of trends reveals that the minimisation of energy consumption was the key optimization objective in the reviewed research, closely followed by the optimization of thermal comfort, indoor air quality and occupant preferences. Hardcoded Matlab program was the most widely used simulation tool, followed by TRNSYS, EnergyPlus, DOE-2, HVACSim+ and ESP-r. Metaheuristic algorithms were the preferred CI method for solving HVAC related problems and in particular genetic algorithms were applied in most of the studies. Despite the low number of studies focussing on multi-agent systems (MAS), as compared to the other CI techniques, interest in the technique is increasing due to their ability of dividing and conquering an HVAC optimization problem with enhanced overall performance.

Furthermore, to understand the mechanism of NO formation and reduction from wood com\u00ac bustion. Nitric oxides (NO) from wood combustion originate mainly from the nitrogen contained in the wood. For this study, a special 25 kW test reactor, comprising a fixed bed gasification Chamber, an electrically heated reduction Chamber and a combustion Chamber was built to examine the stage combustion of wood chips. In comparison with unstaged combustion, the NO emissions from staged combustion can be reduced by 70%. Optimum conditions in the first stage are a primary air ratio of 0.7, a reduction temperature of 1160\u00b0C and a residence time of more than 0.5 s. It was established that these conditions are independent of the nitrogen content of the fuel. Combustion temperature, excess air ratio, fuel moisture content and CO emissions have only a slight effect on the emission of NO. With advanced Staging the NO emissions can be reduced by 20%. N02 emissions of 75 mg/m3 and 220 mg/m3 (at 11% 02) were achieved with the com\u00ac bustion of wood and chip board respectively.

It provides a unique insight into how much and in what way households and individuals may be willing to adapt their transport behavior to achieve carbon reductions. A computer-based transport carbon calculator was developed to investigate the CO2 emissions of individual households from various modes based on travel diary information. This formed the focus of a series of interactive interviews in which participants were asked to consider how their future low carbon transport strategy could look. Views of households on various abatement measures were explored, including technological change in vehicle design or fuel source and behavioral change through, for instance, traffic restraint and investment in public transport. Overall, a 40% reduction in carbon emissions was seen to be feasible through a combination of behavioral change measures and a realistically achievable degree of technological improvement, falling well short of the UK government's goal of a 60% reduction.

Applying the energy storage to diesel-electrical multiple units leads to fuel savings and provides a \"booster\" effect on the acceleration performance. The stored energy is adding additional power on top of the diesel engine power during acceleration. Compared to original diesel power, this additional power can be provided with a relatively low additional weight. Finally, the energy savings of up to 30% and the corresponding emission reduction will already fulfill the targets of various local and global energy saving programs set up by e.g. European Union and big railway operators", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "911c4ebdcab99b4299cba3694c818eb33635454c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3080650848", "DOI": "10.1016/j.rser.2020.110298", "CorpusId": 224922982}, "title": "Acceptability of transport emissions reduction policies: A multi-criteria analysis", "abstract": null, "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "bb9cf4ac29dc03123fab0da80b8f2a289edfbdb3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2238345814", "DOI": "10.1007/S10018-016-0177-Y", "CorpusId": 155126518}, "title": "Multiplier impacts and emission reduction effects of Joint Crediting Mechanism: analysis with a Japanese and international disaggregated input\u2013output table", "abstract": "The reduction of emissions from developing countries is essential in tackling climate change. The Clean Development Mechanism is effective in reducing greenhouse emissions but criticized by various parties. In response, the Japanese government has proposed the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM). Using the 2010 Japanese domestic and the 2005 Asian international input\u2013output tables, we disaggregate the automobile industry and other electrical devices and parts industry to capture hybrid vehicles and solar panels. Moreover, we add the wind turbine industry and the geothermal turbine industry\u00a0in our analysis. In evaluating the JCM, we find that the multiplier impacts of hybrid vehicles, wind turbines and air conditioners are high, whereas boilers and solar panels produce smaller effects. In contrast, the results for the employment effects show that the coke dry quenching plants and lighting equipment create more jobs. We also estimate the emission reduction from the JCM. Taking into account the lifetime of each product/technology and country-specific emission coefficients, we find that lighting equipment\u2019s emission reductions are the greatest, whereas washing machines\u2019 reductions are the least. Thus, it is important to choose the technologies/items suitable for the JCM by balancing their economic and reduction effects.

The results of aMonteCarlo analysis show an average value of life cycle global warming impacts of 202 gCO2-eq/passenger-mile, driven by materials andmanufacturing (50%), followed by daily collection for charging (43%of impact).We illustrate the potential to reduce life cycle global warming impacts through improved scooter collection and charging approaches, including the use of fuel-efficient vehicles for collection (yielding 177 gCO2-eq/passenger-mile), limiting scooter collection to thosewith a lowbattery state of charge (164 gCO2-eq/passenger-mile), and reducing the driving distance per scooter for e-scooter collection and distribution (147 gCO2-eq/passenger-mile). The results prove to be highly sensitive to e-scooter lifetime; ensuring that the shared e-scooters are used for two years decreases the average life cycle emissions to 141 gCO2-eq/passenger-mile.

Few studies, however, have evaluated longitudinal declines in regional cerebral glucose metabolism in patients with dementia caused by Alzheimer's disease. In addition, the available studies have not used recently developed brain mapping algorithms to characterize the progression of Alzheimer's disease throughout the brain, and none considered the statistical power of regional cerebral glucose metabolism in testing the ability of treatments to attenuate the progression of dementia.\n\n\nMETHOD\nThe authors used FDG PET and a brain mapping algorithm to investigate cross-sectional reductions in regional cerebral glucose metabolism, longitudinal decline in regional cerebral glucose metabolism after a 1-year follow-up, and the power of this method to evaluate treatments for Alzheimer's disease in patients with mild to moderate dementia. PET scans were initially acquired in 14 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 34 healthy comparison subjects of similar age and sex. Repeat scans were obtained in the patients 1 year later. Power analyses for voxels showing maximal decline over the 1-year period in regional cerebral glucose metabolism (mg/100 g per minute) were computed to estimate the sample sizes needed to detect a significant treatment response in a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment study.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe patients with Alzheimer's disease had significantly lower glucose metabolism than healthy comparison subjects in parietal, temporal, occipital, frontal, and posterior cingulate cortices. One year later, the patients with Alzheimer's disease had significant declines in glucose metabolism in parietal, temporal, frontal, and posterior cingulate cortices. Using maximal glucose metabolism reductions in the left frontal cortex, we estimated that as few as 36 patients per group would be needed to detect a 33% treatment response with one-tailed significance of p</=0.005 and 80% power in a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment study.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThese findings indicate that brain metabolism as assessed by FDG PET during mental rest is a sensitive marker of disease progression in Alzheimer's disease over a 1-year period. These findings also support the feasibility of using FDG PET as an outcome measure to test the ability of treatments to attenuate the progression of Alzheimer's disease.", "year": 2002}]}
