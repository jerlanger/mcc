Fuel economy and NOx emissions of a pair of class 8 tractor-trailers were measured on a test track to evaluate the effects of single wide tires and trailer aerodynamic devices. Fuel economy was measured using a modified version of SAE test procedure J1321. NOx emissions were measured using a portable emissions monitoring system (PEMS). Fuel consumption was estimated by a carbon balance on PEMS output and correlated to fuel meter measurements. Tests were conducted using drive cycles simulating highway operations at 55 mph and 65 mph and suburban stop-and-go traffic. The tests showed a negative correlation (significant at p < 0.05) between fuel economy and NOx emissions. Single wide tires and trailer aerodynamic devices resulted in increased fuel economy and decreased NOx emissions relative to the baseline tests. Decreases in NOx emissions were disproportionately larger than increases in fuel economy; however, this effect may be an artifact of the particular engine being tested.

Little consideration has been given to the potential adverse carbon consequences associated with the technology transition. This paper considers the embodied emissions that will occur to replace the UK\u2019s fossil fuel-reliant energy supply with low carbon sources. The analysis generates a number of representative scenarios where emissions embodied in energy systems are integrated within current national climate and energy policy objectives. The embodied emissions associated with a new low carbon energy system are lower than the emissions reduction associated with the low carbon energy sources, confirming that there is a carbon return on investment. However, even if the UK reaches its 2050 territorial climate target, it is estimated that by 2050 an additional 200 Mt CO2 emissions are generated overseas (compared to 128 Mt generated within the UK) in the production of imported fuels and infrastructure components. The cost-optimal model results suggest that more electrification would need to occur, supported by nuclear energy, mainly in replacement of natural gas to mitigate these emissions. However, due to a number of deployment barriers, other policy interventions along the energy supply chain are likely needed, which are discussed alongside the model results.

The star-shaped molecules consist of an electron-deficient 1,3,5-triazine core with three fluorene arms substituted with diarylamino (TAM1-TAM3) or carbazolyl (TAM4) electron donors. Cyclic voltammetry of TAM1-TAM3 shows that the reduction consists of one wave of single electron transfer to the core, while the oxidation exhibits a single peak of three sequential electron-transfer processes, with the formation of a trication. The carbazole-containing molecule TAM4 after oxidation undergoes a subsequent rapid chemical reaction to produce a dimer (via the overall coupling of two radical cations with the loss of two protons). The dimer electrooxidizes more easily than the monomer of TAM4. With continuous cycling on the oxidation side, a conductive polymer film is formed on the surface of the working electrode. Because of the presence of the acceptor (triazine) center and strong donors in the arms (diarylamine or carbazole), TAM1-TAM3 exhibit large solvatochromic effects with emissions ranging from deep blue (428 nm) to orange-red (575 nm) depending on the solvent polarity. These star-shaped molecules show high PL quantum yields of 0.70-0.81. The electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) of TAM1-TAM3 in nonaqueous solutions showed strong ECL that could be seen with the naked eye in a well-lit room. Because the enthalpy of annihilation is higher than the energy required for formation of the singlet excited state, the ECL emission is believed to be generated via S-route annihilation.

Effects on EMI emissions reduction are clearly worthy when selecting the modulation parameters in a convenient way.

Using ZnO NWs with Au nanoparticles (NPs) would decrease the recombination rate of hole-electron pairs due to the great shift of the Fermi level to the conduction band. Hence, adding Au NPs was a promising method to enhance the photocatalytic performance of ZnO NWs. It is significant that photocatalyst fabricated by ZnO NWs can apply to the degradation of organic pollution, and solve the environmental issues.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a8a59d807393a7b8ee21b1dadd065c9998a9ebb2", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "7362232", "MAG": "3042788460", "DOI": "10.1136/bmj.m2322", "CorpusId": 220526856, "PubMed": "32669369"}, "title": "The healthiness and sustainability of national and global food based dietary guidelines: modelling study", "abstract": "Abstract Objective To analyse the health and environmental implications of adopting national food based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) at a national level and compared with global health and environmental targets. Design Modelling study. Setting 85 countries. Participants Population of 85 countries. Main outcome measures A graded coding method was developed and used to extract quantitative recommendations from 85 FBDGs. The health and environmental impacts of these guidelines were assessed by using a comparative risk assessment of deaths from chronic diseases and a set of country specific environmental footprints for greenhouse gas emissions, freshwater use, cropland use, and fertiliser application. For comparison, the impacts of adopting the global dietary recommendations of the World Health Organization and the EAT-Lancet Commission on Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems were also analysed. Each guideline\u2019s health and sustainability implications were assessed by modelling its adoption at both the national level and globally, and comparing the impacts to global health and environmental targets, including the Action Agenda on Non-Communicable Diseases, the Paris Climate Agreement, the Aichi biodiversity targets related to land use, and the sustainable development goals and planetary boundaries related to freshwater use and fertiliser application. Results Adoption of national FBDGs was associated with reductions in premature mortality of 15% on average (95% uncertainty interval 13% to 16%) and mixed changes in environmental resource demand, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 13% on average (regional range \u221234% to 35%). When universally adopted globally, most of the national guidelines (83, 98%) were not compatible with at least one of the global health and environmental targets. About a third of the FBDGs (29, 34%) were incompatible with the agenda on non-communicable diseases, and most (57 to 74, 67% to 87%) were incompatible with the Paris Climate Agreement and other environmental targets. In comparison, adoption of the WHO recommendations was associated with similar health and environmental changes, whereas adoption of the EAT-Lancet recommendations was associated with 34% greater reductions in premature mortality, more than three times greater reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and general attainment of the global health and environmental targets. As an example, the FBDGs of the UK, US, and China were incompatible with the climate change, land use, freshwater, and nitrogen targets, and adopting guidelines in line with the EAT-Lancet recommendation could increase the number of avoided deaths from 78\u2009000 (74\u2009000 to 81\u2009000) to 104\u2009000 (96\u2009000 to 112\u2009000) in the UK, from 480\u2009000 (445\u2009000 to 516\u2009000) to 585\u2009000 (523\u2009000 to 646\u2009000) in the USA, and from 1\u2009149\u2009000 (1\u2009095\u2009000 to 1\u2009204\u2009000) to 1\u2009802\u2009000 (1\u2009664\u2009000 to 1\u2009941\u2009000) in China. Conclusions This analysis suggests that national guidelines could be both healthier and more sustainable. Providing clearer advice on limiting in most contexts the consumption of animal source foods, in particular beef and dairy, was found to have the greatest potential for increasing the environmental sustainability of dietary guidelines, whereas increasing the intake of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, and legumes, reducing the intake of red and processed meat, and highlighting the importance of attaining balanced energy intake and weight levels were associated with most of the additional health benefits. The health results were based on observational data and assuming a causal relation between dietary risk factors and health outcomes. The certainty of evidence for these relations is mostly graded as moderate in existing meta-analyses.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "9b7cb86fc8fc89e901d0d3d6392909c26376948b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3037096990", "DOI": "10.1080/09593330.2020.1788171", "CorpusId": 220067057, "PubMed": "32579488"}, "title": "Analysing the role of environment-related technologies and carbon emissions in emerging economies: a step towards sustainable development", "abstract": "ABSTRACT The evaluation of the contribution of consumption-based carbon (CBCO2) emissions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is crucially important for the design of sustainable environmental policies.

The production of rice, the staple crop for the majority of the world\u2019s population, emits large quantities of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. According to various governments, global rice production emits 500 million tons of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide equivalent) per year\u2014or at least 10 percent of total agricultural emissions. The figure may be closer to 800 million tons when adjusted for new estimates by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the sustained warming effect of methane. Although uncertain, there is evidence that increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could also increase future rice-related emissions substantially through its effect on soil microbes. Most of the world\u2019s rice grows in inundated conditions, and one of the most promising techniques for reducing rice-related emissions is to reduce or interrupt the periods of flooding. The production of rice in flooded paddies produces methane because the water blocks oxygen from penetrating the soil, creating conditions conducive for methane-producing bacteria. Shorter flooding intervals and more frequent interruptions of flooding lower bacte rial methane production and thus methane emissions.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "65c69aa10661b536e01af48a2b6ce462cf718f7f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2553218358", "CorpusId": 133143932}, "title": "An analysis of mitigation as a response to climate change.", "abstract": "pReface COPENHAGEN CONSENSUS ON CLIMATE copenhAgen consensus on climAte The Copenhagen Consensus Center has commissioned 21 papers to examine the costs and benefits of different solutions to global warming. The project\u2019s goal is to answer the question: \u201cIf the global community wants to spend up to, say $250 billion per year over the next 10 years to diminish the adverse effects of climate changes, and to do most good for the world, which solutions would yield the greatest net benefits?\u201d The series of papers is divided into Assessment Papers and Perspective Papers. Each Assessment Paper outlines the costs and benefits of one way to respond to global warming. Each Perspective Paper reviews the assumptions and analyses made within an Assessment Paper. It is hoped that, as a body of work, this research will provide a foundation for an informed debate about the best way to respond to this threat. The impact of climate change is rather uncertain. Available estimates suggest that the welfare loss induced by climate change in the year 2100 is in the same order as losing a few percent of income. That is, a century worth of climate change is about as bad as losing one or two years of economic growth. The impact of climate policy is better understood. A clever and gradual abatement policy can substantially reduce emissions (e.g., to stabilise greenhouse gas emissions at 650 and 550 ppm CO2eq) at an acceptable cost (1 or 2 years of growth out of 100, respectively). Very stringent targets (e.g., the 2oC of the EU) may be very costly, however, or even infeasible. Suboptimal policy design would substantially add to the costs of emission abatement. For the Copenhagen Consensus on Climate 2009, this paper considers five alternative policies for carbon dioxide emission reduction. The alternatives differ in scope and intensity only. All five alternatives implement a uniform carbon tax, as that is the cheapest way to reduce emissions. The first policy spends $2.5 trillion on emission reduction in the OECD before 2020. This is rather silly. The benefit-cost ratio is less than 1/100. The second policy spends $2.5 trillion across the world before 2020. This is less silly because non-OECD emission reduction is a lot cheaper, but the benefit-cost ratio is still only 1/100. The third policy continues the same intensity of climate policy between 2020 and 2100. Most negative impacts of climate change are avoided by this policy, but the costs are so large that the benefit-cost ratio is only 1/50. In the fourth policy, $2.5 trillion is invested in a trust fund to finance emission reduction over the century. The benefit-cost ratio is 1/4. In the fifth policy, the trust fund is twenty times as small. The benefit-cost ratio is 3/2. In this policy, a tax of $2/tC is imposed in 2010 on all emissions from all sources in all countries; the tax rises with the rate of discount. As the analysis ignores uncertainty and equity, one may argue for a more stringent climate policy. However, the analysis also ignores suboptimal implementation, which argues for a more lenient climate policy.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "96ae12e777de02e447eab3763b24f55aabbe6a21", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2171437789", "DOI": "10.1111/j.1747-6593.2011.00264.x", "CorpusId": 111373790}, "title": "Towards a common carbon footprint assessment methodology for the water sector", "abstract": "This paper describes the carbon footprint methodology used in assessing the global warming potential of the Dutch water sector.

The transistors also show longer time threshold voltage shifts due to two other distinct mechanisms: charge trapping in the silicon nitride gate insulator and metastable dangling bond state creation in the amorphous silicon. These two mechanisms show characteristically different bias, temperature, and time dependencies of the threshold voltage shift. Illumination of a TFT causes the generation of electron-hole pairs in the space-charge region leading to a steady-state equal flux of electrons and holes and a reduction in the band-bending. In most applications, the photosensitivity should be minimized. The uniformity of large arrays of transistors for display applications is excellent, with variations in the threshold voltage of 0.5-1.0 V. >", "year": 1989}, {"paperId": "fec0c29275a844382cbcf92cd6837d40d7f4880f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1969448521", "DOI": "10.4155/cmt.13.78", "CorpusId": 153920135}, "title": "Connecting the dots: policy connections between Pacific Island shipping and global CO2 and pollutant emission reduction", "abstract": "The relationships between the global discourse on emissions reduction, particularly in regard to international shipping, and the need for more sustainable Pacific Island sea transport services are discussed.

This study shows for many regions a 50% reduction in the probability of extreme warm periods could be seen in 20 years, indicating near-term benefits of early mitigation. Large differences in climate outcomes are projected by the end of this century depending on whether greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase or are reduced sufficiently to limit total warming to below 2\u2009\u00b0C (ref.\u00a01). However, it is generally thought that benefits of mitigation are hidden by internal climate variability until later in the century2. Here we show that if the likelihood of extremely hot seasons is considered, the benefits of mitigation emerge more quickly than previously thought. It takes less than 20 years of emissions reductions in many regions for the likelihood of extreme seasonal warmth to reduce by more than half following initiation of mitigation. Additionally we show that the latest possible date at which the probability of extreme seasonal temperatures will be halved through emissions reductions consistent with the 2\u2009\u00b0C target is in the 2040s.

Many compounds have been evaluated for their efficacy to suppress enteric methane production by ruminal microorganisms. Of these, nitrate as an alternative hydrogen sink has been among the most promising, but it suffers from variability in efficacy for reasons that are not understood. The accumulation of nitrite, which is poisonous when absorbed into the animal\u2019s circulation, is also variable and poorly understood. This review identifies large gaps in our knowledge of rumen microbial ecology that handicap the further development and safety of nitrate as a dietary additive. Three main bacterial species have been associated historically with ruminal nitrate reduction, namely Wolinella succinogenes, Veillonella parvula, and Selenomonas ruminantium, but others almost certainly exist in the largely uncultivated ruminal microbiota. Indications are strong that ciliate protozoa can reduce nitrate, but the significance of their role relative to bacteria is not known. The metabolic fate of the reduced nitrate has not been studied in detail. It is important to be sure that nitrate metabolism and efforts to enhance rates of nitrite reduction do not lead to the evolution of the much more potent GHG, nitrous oxide. The relative importance of direct inhibition of archaeal methanogenic enzymes by nitrite or the efficiency of capture of hydrogen by nitrate reduction in lowering methane production is also not known, nor are nitrite effects on other members of the microbiota.

In addition to producing both electricity and heat, CHP systems can be coupled with vapor compression systems to provide cooling. This paper analyzes a natural gas engine CHP system together with a vapor compression system for different American climate zones. Performance is measured in terms of operational costs, PEC, and carbon dioxide emissions as a percent of a reference building. The objective of this paper is to compare the performance of a CHP system operating 24\u2009h a day with a system that only operates during typical office hours. Furthermore, the system is optimized based on reducing PEC, minimizing costs, and reducing emissions. In addition, the benefits of CHP systems based on the Energy Star program and the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program are presented. Results show that, in general, it is more beneficial to operate the CHP system during typical office hours than to operate the system 24\u2009h a day. Also, the CHP system performance strongly depends on the location where it is installed. In addition to reductions in cost, primary energy, and emissions, CHP systems can help achieve the Energy Star label for commercial office buildings and help obtain LEED points that go toward achieving LEED certification status.

We searched for gamma-ray emission from the SMC in order to derive constraints on the CR population and transport in an external system with properties different from the Milky Way. We analysed the first 17 months of continuous all-sky observations by the Large Area Telescope of the Fermi mission to determine the spatial distribution, flux and spectrum of the gamma-ray emission from the SMC. We also used past radio synchrotron observations of the SMC to study the population of CR electrons specifically.

The emission is steady and from an extended source ~3{\\deg} in size. It is not clearly correlated with the distribution of massive stars or neutral gas, nor with known pulsars or SNRs, but a certain correlation with supergiant shells is observed. The observed flux implies an upper limit on the average CR nuclei density in the SMC of ~15% of the value measured locally in the Milky Way. The population of high-energy pulsars of the SMC may account for a substantial fraction of the gamma-ray flux, which would make the inferred CR nuclei density even lower. The average density of CR electrons derived from radio synchrotron observations is consistent with the same reduction factor but the uncertainties are large.

The model was tested by reallocating 10% only of the protein production from a ruminant to a non ruminant source to minimize the risk of including rangeland or marginal lands. This displacement generated residual land which was found to play a major role in the potential mitigation of GHG emissions. The model will allow land use policies aimed at reducing the agricultural GHG emissions to be assessed. Abstract To assess tradeoffs between environmental sustainability and changes in food production on agricultural land in Canada the Unified Livestock Industry and Crop Emissions Estimation System (ULICEES) was developed. It incorporates four livestock specific GHG assessments in a single model. To demonstrate the application of ULICEES, 10% of beef cattle protein production was assumed to be displaced with an equivalent amount of pork protein. Without accounting for the loss of soil carbon, this 10% shift reduced GHG emissions by 2.5 TgCO2e y\u22121. The payback period was defined as the number of years required for a GHG reduction to equal soil carbon lost from the associated land use shift. A payback period that is shorter than 40 years represents a net long term decrease in GHG emissions. Displacing beef cattle with hogs resulted in a surplus area of forage. When this residual land was left in ungrazed perennial forage, the payback periods were less than 4 years and when it was reseeded to annual crops, they were equal to or less than 40 years. They were generally greater than 40 years when this land was used to raise cattle. Agricultural GHG mitigation policies will inevitably involve a trade-off between production, land use and GHG emission reduction. ULICEES is a model that can objectively assess these trade-offs for Canadian agriculture.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "304f28931aac1c2ca3c71efcefbf6d7fae697fe9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1967844001", "DOI": "10.1029/2000JD900701", "CorpusId": 28996907}, "title": "Western European N2O emissions: A top\u2010down approach based on atmospheric observations", "abstract": "We present a 3 year record of continuous gas chromatographic nitrous oxide (N2O) observations performed at the urban station Heidelberg (Germany) together with weekly flask data from a remote continental site, Schauinsland (Black Forest, Germany), and two-weekly integrated data from the maritime background station Izana (Canary Islands).

Although China has surpassed the United States as the world's largest carbon dioxide emitter, in situ measurements of atmospheric CO2 have been sparse in China. This paper analyzes hourly CO2 and its correlation with CO at Miyun, a rural site near Beijing, over a period of 51 months (Dec 2004 through Feb 2009). The CO2-CO correlation analysis evaluated separately for each hour of the day provides useful information with statistical significance even in the growing season. We found that the intercept, representing the initial condition imposed by global distribution of CO2 with influence of photosynthesis and respiration, exhibits diurnal cycles differing by season. The background CO2 (CO2,b) derived from Miyun observations is comparable to CO2 observed at a Mongolian background station to the northwest. Annual growth of overall mean CO2 at Miyun is estimated at 2.7 ppm yr\u22121 while that of CO2,b is only 1.7 ppm yr\u22121 similar to the mean growth rate at northern mid-latitude background stations. This suggests a relatively faster increase in the regional CO2 sources in China than the global average, consistent with bottom-up studies of CO2 emissions. For air masses with trajectories through the northern China boundary layer, mean winter CO2/CO correlation slopes (dCO2/dCO) increased by 2.8 \u00b1 0.9 ppmv/ppmv or 11% from 2005\u20132006 to 2007\u20132008, with CO2 increasing by 1.8 ppmv. The increase in dCO2/dCO indicates improvement in overall combustion efficiency over northern China after winter 2007, attributed to pollution reduction measures associated with the 2008 Beijing Olympics. The observed CO2/CO ratio at Miyun is 25% higher than the bottom-up CO2/CO emission ratio, suggesting a contribution of respired CO2 from urban residents as well as agricultural soils and livestock in the observations and uncertainty in the emission estimates.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "2ae51a838a906c52a9a823d1cfdcb105dc8ff794", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1978944459", "DOI": "10.1006/nimg.2001.0747", "CorpusId": 747265, "PubMed": "11304083"}, "title": "Activation Reduction in Anterior Temporal Cortices during Repeated Recognition of Faces of Personal Acquaintances", "abstract": "Repeated recognition of the face of a familiar individual is known to show semantic repetition priming effect.

Below a dissolved oxygen concentration of 5% air saturation, the relatively highest N2O production was observed. Under these conditions, significant activities of nitrite reductase could be measured.

After transition from anaerobic conditions to aerobic conditions, nitrite reduction continued (at a lower rate) for several hours. N2O reduction appeared to stop immediately after the switch, indicating inhibition of nitrous oxide reductase, resulting in high N2O emissions (maximum, 1.4 mmol liter-1 h-1).

The climate warming effects of accelerated urbanization along with projected global climate change raise an urgent need for sustainable mitigation and adaptation strategies to cool urban climates. Our modeling results show that historical urbanization in the Los Angeles and San Diego metropolitan areas has increased daytime urban air temperature by 1.3 \u00b0C, in part due to a weakening of the onshore sea breeze circulation. We find that metropolis-wide adoption of cool roofs can meaningfully offset this daytime warming, reducing temperatures by 0.9 \u00b0C relative to a case without cool roofs. Residential cool roofs were responsible for 67% of the cooling. Nocturnal temperature increases of 3.1 \u00b0C from urbanization were larger than daytime warming, while nocturnal temperature reductions from cool roofs of 0.5 \u00b0C were weaker than corresponding daytime reductions. We further show that cool roof deployment could partially counter the local impacts of global climate change in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Assuming a scenario in which there are dramatic decreases in greenhouse gas emissions in the 21st century (RCP2.6), mid- and end-of-century temperature increases from global change relative to current climate are similarly reduced by cool roofs from 1.4 \u00b0C to 0.6 \u00b0C. Assuming a scenario with continued emissions increases throughout the century (RCP8.5), mid-century warming is significantly reduced by cool roofs from 2.0 \u00b0C to 1.0 \u00b0C. The end-century warming, however, is significantly offset only in small localized areas containing mostly industrial/commercial buildings where cool roofs with the highest albedo are adopted. We conclude that metropolis-wide adoption of cool roofs can play an important role in mitigating the urban heat island effect, and offsetting near-term local warming from global climate change. Global-scale reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are the only way of avoiding long-term warming, however. We further suggest that both climate mitigation and adaptation can be pursued simultaneously using 'cool photovoltaics'.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "2dfd123dee9fddf8713d90334f78a810c21bb09e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2038616303", "DOI": "10.3763/cdev.2009.0010", "CorpusId": 154167139}, "title": "The Greenhouse Development Rights framework", "abstract": "The vast majority of emission reductions required to prevent dangerous climate change must be made in the developing world.

However, the rapid improvement of carbon efficiency in developing regions together with the post-2008 deceleration in international trade raises the question of whether such embodied emission transfers have peaked. Here we update historical analysis, finding that emission transfers between OECD and non-OECD countries peaked in 2006, and have been declining since. The reversal is principally due to the reduction in the emissions intensity of traded goods, rather than the volume of trade. A more recent decline in embodied emissions transfers is also observed in trade between developing countries. We analyse whether these trends are likely to continue, by exploring a baseline and a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) scenario with the Macro-econometric Energy-Environment-Economy Model (E3ME) model. The results suggest that absolute embodied emissions will plateau at current levels or slowly return to pre-2008- crisis levels, and differences between the NDC and baseline scenarios imply that NDC policies will not result in significant carbon leakage. However, the share of national footprint embodied in imports, at least for countries with ambitious decarbonization policies, will likely increase. This suggests that, despite the world-wide stabilization of emissions transfers, addressing emissions embodied in imports will become increasingly important for reducing carbon footprints. Key policy insights Emissions embodied in imports have plateaued since 2006, and are unlikely to return to the peak of the mid-2000s. For developed countries, as domestic decarbonization occurs, the share of emissions embodied in imports as a percentage of the total national carbon footprint will increase. The Paris NDCs in themselves are unlikely to cause significant carbon leakage. Climate policy will ideally focus on reducing both production and consumption emissions, through a variety of mechanisms, especially centred around international assistance.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "156fad2dd511afff652d0c48a3bdd6bcdd862bd7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2131847304", "DOI": "10.1109/TSMCB.2002.804372", "CorpusId": 29155380}, "title": "Multiobjective evolutionary algorithm for the optimization of noisy combustion processes", "abstract": "This work introduces a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm capable of handling noisy problems with a particular emphasis on robustness against unexpected measurements (outliers).

To quantify the sources and changes of N and P inputs to the lake as a result of economic changes, we modelled emissions, transfer and in-stream retention using a GIS model. The model was calibrated using river monitoring data from the 1985\u20131989 period, and used to simulate emissions and loads for five future scenarios for 2015\u20132019. During the 1985\u20131999 period, diffuse P emissions decreased relatively more than N diffuse emissions, but this was not reflected in the loads to the lake. P loads decreased relatively less than N loads, which caused a decrease in the N:P ratio of the rivers. About 30\u201345% of diffuse N emissions and only 3\u201310% of diffuse P emissions reaches the river network. In-stream retention reduces N and P loads to the lake by about 62% and 72%, respectively. Point sources contribute negligibly to the N load to the lake, but form about one-third of the P load. A target/fast development scenario is the most likely scenario for the 2015\u20132019 period, resulting in higher nutrient loads than in recent years.

The pond's atmospheric CO2 exchange was not related to NEP or temperature but likely to a high allochthonous carbon (C) input via runoff and anaerobic mineralization of C.

This work reviews the existing methodologies for source apportionment and sensitivity analysis to identify key differences and stress their implicit limitations. The emphasis is laid on the differences between source impacts (sensitivity analysis) and contributions (source apportionment) obtained by using four different methodologies: brute-force top-down, brute-force bottom-up, tagged species and decoupled direct method (DDM). A simple theoretical example to compare these approaches is used highlighting differences and potential implications for policy. When the relationships between concentration and emissions are linear, impacts and contributions are equivalent concepts. In this case, source apportionment and sensitivity analysis may be used indifferently for both air quality planning purposes and quantifying source contributions. However, this study demonstrates that when the relationship between emissions and concentrations is nonlinear, sensitivity approaches are not suitable to retrieve source contributions and source apportionment methods are not appropriate to evaluate the impact of abatement strategies. A quantification of the potential nonlinearities should therefore be the first step prior to source apportionment or planning applications, to prevent any limitations in their use. When nonlinearity is mild, these limitations may, however, be acceptable in the context of the other uncertainties inherent to complex models. Moreover, when using sensitivity analysis for planning, it is important to note that, under nonlinear circumstances, the calculated impacts will only provide information for the exact conditions (e.g.\u00a0emission reduction share) that are simulated.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "e24f995efd77b4be52d6295e8689d7776a88df81", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2594183246", "DOI": "10.1056/NEJMms1615242", "CorpusId": 205088797, "PubMed": "28249122"}, "title": "The Trump Administration and the Environment \u2014 Heed the Science", "abstract": "Threats to foster fossil-fuel utilization over sustainable alternatives, abandonment of reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions, and narrowing of the definition of waters subject to EPA regulation raise serious concerns about the environment and human health.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "d10d25680143728ac04e30044e47aba0153e1d04", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1215808992", "CorpusId": 82203418}, "title": "An appraisal of global wetland area and its organic carbon stock", "abstract": "Wetlands are among the most important natural resources on earth.

A multi-model analysis of the Zero Emissions Commitment from CO2", "abstract": "Abstract. The Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC) is the change in global mean temperature expected to occur following the cessation of net CO2 emissions and as such is a critical parameter for calculating the remaining carbon budget. The Zero Emissions Commitment Model Intercomparison Project (ZECMIP) was established to gain a better understanding of the potential magnitude and sign of ZEC, in addition to the processes that underlie this metric. A total of 18 Earth system models of both full and intermediate complexity participated in ZECMIP. All models conducted an experiment where atmospheric CO2 concentration increases exponentially until 1000\u2009PgC has been emitted. Thereafter emissions are set to zero and models are configured to allow free evolution of atmospheric CO2 concentration. Many models conducted additional second-priority simulations with different cumulative emission totals and an alternative idealized emissions pathway with a gradual transition to zero emissions. The inter-model range of ZEC 50\u00a0years after emissions cease for the 1000\u2009PgC experiment is \u22120.36 to 0.29\u2009\u2218C, with a model ensemble mean of \u22120.07\u2009\u2218C, median of \u22120.05\u2009\u2218C, and standard deviation of 0.19\u2009\u2218C. Models exhibit a wide variety of behaviours after emissions cease, with some models continuing to warm for decades to millennia and others cooling substantially. Analysis shows that both the carbon uptake by the ocean and the terrestrial biosphere are important for counteracting the warming effect from the reduction in ocean heat uptake in the decades after emissions cease. This warming effect is difficult to constrain due to high uncertainty in the efficacy of ocean heat uptake. Overall, the most likely value of ZEC on multi-decadal timescales is close to zero, consistent with previous model experiments and simple theory.\n", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "c78f2e432f193b8072a21053cd6759ea649ef59e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2809125115", "DOI": "10.1007/S12053-018-9696-7", "CorpusId": 158334708}, "title": "A long-term meta-frontier analysis of energy and emission efficiencies between G7 and BRICS", "abstract": "The current concern over energy utilization and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can be surveyed by investigating potential energy savings and potential emissions reduction in order to emit less greenhouse gases (GHG), thus allowing countries to create economic growth while at the same time preventing global warming and mitigating climate change.

LSCs consist of highly luminescent compounds embedded or coated on a transparent substrate that absorb diffuse or direct solar radiation over a large area. The resulting luminescence is trapped in the waveguide by total internal reflection to the thin edges of the substrate where the concentrated light can be used to improve the performance of photovoltaic devices. The concept of LSCs has been around for several decades, and yet the efficiencies of current devices are still below expectations for commercial viability. There are two primary challenges when designing new chromophores for LSC applications. Reabsorption of dye emission by chromophores within the waveguide is a significant loss mechanism attenuating the light output of LSCs. Concentration quenching, particularly in organic dye systems, restricts the quantity of chromophores that can be incorporated in the waveguide thus limiting the light absorbed by the LSC. Frequently, a compromise between increased light harvesting of the incident light and decreasing emission quantum yield is required for most organic chromophore-based systems due to concentration quenching. The low Stokes shift of common organic dyes used in current LSCs also imposes another optimization problem. Increasing light absorption of LSCs based on organic dyes to achieve efficient light harvesting also enhances reabsorption. Ideally, a design strategy to simultaneously optimize light harvesting, concentration quenching, and reabsorption of LSC chromophores is clearly needed to address the significant losses in LSCs. Over the past few years, research in our group has targeted novel dye structures that address these primary challenges. There is a common perception that dye aggregates are to be avoided in LSCs. It became apparent in our studies that aggregates of chromophores exhibiting aggregation-induced emission (AIE) behavior are attractive candidates for LSC applications. Strategic application of AIE chromophores has led to the development of the first organic-based transparent solar concentrator that harvests UV light as well as the demonstration of reabsorption reduction by taking advantage of energy migration processes between chromophores. Further developments led us to the application of perylene diimides using an energy migration/energy transfer approach. To prevent concentration quenching, a molecularly insulated perylene diimide with bulky substituents attached to the imide positions was designed and synthesized. By combining the insulated perylene diimide with a commercial perylene dye as an energy donor-acceptor emitter pair, detrimental luminescence reabsorption was reduced while achieving a high chromophore concentration for efficient light absorption.

Between these conflicting priorities of traffic growth on the one hand and climate protection on the other, radical new approaches in terms of airframe design and propulsion systems are necessary on a long term basis to accomplish both ambitious goals.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a2f7495b1a042be745684f95cfecae94a0ca7654", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2397683451", "DOI": "10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2016.05.054", "CorpusId": 156584318}, "title": "Online shopping habits and the potential for reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from passenger transport", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "413428293c604062d849041b1ba24dfa92c0c06b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2119457577", "PubMedCentral": "3411304", "DOI": "10.1007/s00330-012-2434-1", "CorpusId": 5972303, "PubMed": "22527375"}, "title": "Diagnostic performance of stress myocardial perfusion imaging for coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis", "abstract": "ObjectivesTo determine and compare the diagnostic performance of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), using conventional coronary angiography (CCA) as the reference standard.MethodsWe searched Medline and Embase for literature that evaluated stress MPI for the diagnosis of obstructive CAD using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), contrast-enhanced echocardiography (ECHO), single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET).ResultsAll pooled analyses were based on random effects models. Articles on MRI yielded a total of 2,970 patients from 28 studies, articles on ECHO yielded a sample size of 795 from 10 studies, articles on SPECT yielded 1,323 from 13 studies. For CAD defined as either at least 50\u00a0%, at least 70\u00a0% or at least 75\u00a0% lumen diameter reduction on CCA, the natural logarithms of the diagnostic odds ratio (lnDOR) for MRI (3.63; 95\u00a0% CI 3.26\u20134.00) was significantly higher compared to that of SPECT (2.76; 95\u00a0% CI 2.28\u20133.25; P\u2009=\u20090.006) and that of ECHO (2.83; 95\u00a0% CI 2.29\u20133.37; P\u2009=\u20090.02). There was no significant difference between the lnDOR of SPECT and ECHO (P\u2009=\u20090.52).ConclusionOur results suggest that MRI is superior for the diagnosis of obstructive CAD compared with ECHO and SPECT. ECHO and SPECT demonstrated similar diagnostic performance.Key Points\u2022 MRI can assess myocardial perfusion.\u2022 MR perfusion diagnoses coronary artery disease better than echocardiography or SPECT.\u2022 Echocardiography and SPECT have similar diagnostic performance.\u2022 MRI can save coronary artery disease patients from more invasive tests.\u2022 MRI and SPECT show evidence of publication bias, implying possible overestimation.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a68ad81df5b2cec3ef9f4c6ee1ec7ac98fd80bc2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1970779597", "DOI": "10.1063/1.1136940", "CorpusId": 120980971}, "title": "Computer\u2010controlled plasma emission spectroscopy", "abstract": "A mirror system, consisting of a rotating mirror and a pair of coupled stepping mirrors, is used in conjunction with computer control of data acquisition followed by computer reduction of the data for a quick determination of plasma properties.", "year": 1982}, {"paperId": "3ebaf2636f1b1a0146f9e8dccb7829e16d6bb643", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2225955713", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.nanolett.5b00678", "CorpusId": 206725203, "PubMed": "25989354"}, "title": "Enhanced Amplified Spontaneous Emission in Perovskites Using a Flexible Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Reflector.", "abstract": "Organic-inorganic perovskites are highly promising solar cell materials with laboratory-based power conversion efficiencies already matching those of established thin film technologies. Their exceptional photovoltaic performance is in part attributed to the presence of efficient radiative recombination pathways, thereby opening up the possibility of efficient light-emitting devices. Here, we demonstrate optically pumped amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) at 780 nm from a 50 nm-thick film of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite that is sandwiched within a cavity composed of a thin-film (\u223c7 \u03bcm) cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) reflector and a metal back-reflector. The threshold fluence for ASE in the perovskite film is reduced by at least two orders of magnitude in the presence of the CLC reflector, which results in a factor of two reduction in threshold fluence compared to previous reports. We consider this to be due to improved coupling of the oblique and out-of-plane modes that are reflected into the bulk in addition to any contributions from cavity modes. Furthermore, we also demonstrate enhanced ASE on flexible reflectors and discuss how improvements in the quality factor and reflectivity of the CLC layers could lead to single-mode lasing using CLC reflectors. Our work opens up the possibility of fabricating widely wavelength-tunable \"mirror-less\" single-mode lasers on flexible substrates, which could find use in applications such as flexible displays and friend or foe identification.", "year": 2015}]}
