Large sulphur emission control programs were implemented in Europe and North America with the expectation that many affected aquatic ecosystems would recover. Because of a variety of factors, these positive expectations have been slow to be realized. Only limited evidence of the chemical recovery of acid lakes has emerged from areas other than the Sudbury, Canada region, where sulphur emission reductions were particularly large. Lake response models indicate that when current sulphur emission control strategies in Europe and North America are fully implemented, many lakes will still be acid-damaged even though substantial overall improvements in lake chemistry are expected. An increasing body of evidence indicates that substantial biological recovery, among many groups of organisms,can be expected when chemical conditions improve in lakes. Not all species, however, are capable of unassisted recovery and some lakes can pose biological or physical barriers to colonizers. Thus, stocking may be an important element in management strategies for the restoration of some recovering lakes. Communities in recovered lakes may not achieve pre disturbance conditions, but establishment of typical communities appears to be a reasonable recovery target.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "0359c6b6b0ea9c85f6f2108261475da9ba5dc113", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2147675126", "DOI": "10.1080/00036840122068", "CorpusId": 18623343}, "title": "Water pollution abatement by Chinese industry: cost estimates and policy implications", "abstract": "Factory-level data are used to estimate water pollution abatement costs for Chinese industry. Joint abatement cost functions are utilized which relate total costs to treatment volume and the simultaneous effect of reductions in suspended solids, chemical oxygen demand, biological oxygen demand and other pollutants. Tests of alternative functional forms suggest that a very simple (constant elasticity) model fits the data as well as a complex (translog) model, permitting sophisticated policy experiments with relatively simple calculations. From the results, the cost-effectiveness of current pollution control policy in China is analysed. Basic conclusions are (1) The benefits of stricter discharge standards should be weighed carefully against the costs. For the sample of 260 factories, a shift across the existing range of standards entails a present-value difference of US$330 million in abatement costs. (2) Emissions charges as low as US$1.00/ton would be sufficient to induce 80% abatement of suspended solids for cost-minimizing factories. Charges of US$3, US$15 and US$30 per ton would be sufficient to induce 90% abatement of TSS, COD and BOD. (3) The current regulatory system provides an economic incentive to abate by charging a levy on pollution in excess of the standard. However, the results suggest that changing to a full emissions charge system would greatly reduce overall abatement costs. For the 260 factories in the sample, the current overall abatement rate could be attained under a charge system at a reduced annual cost whose present value is US$344 million.", "year": 1996}, {"paperId": "5df2a1bb20d3bb97566d5534b364ef1a4516d3a3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2179407142", "DOI": "10.1007/S12206-015-0951-Y", "CorpusId": 111077777}, "title": "Experimental investigation of combustion, performance and emission characteristics of a modified piston", "abstract": "In this investigation, the combustion, performance and emission characteristics of a diesel engine powered with Modified piston (MP) are studied.

We measured institutional quality using government effectiveness and control of corruption indicators. The GMM estimation results indicate that government effectiveness modifies the economic growth-emissions relationship. For low values of this institutional indicator, we found diminishing increments of CO2 emissions as GDP grows. In the case of countries with high government effectiveness, we observed a statistically significant reduction in CO2 emissions only in some specifications. We did not confirm the moderating role of the control of corruption in shaping the economic growth-carbon dioxide emissions nexus.

However, it has seldom been used in light-duty diesel engines. Therefore, this paper focuses on an investigation into the thermal efficiency and pollution emission analysis of a light-duty diesel engine generator fueled with different water content emulsified diesel fuels (WD, including WD-0, WD-5, WD-10, and WD-15). In this study, nitric oxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and carbon dioxide were analyzed by a vehicle emission gas analyzer, and the particle size and number concentration were measured by an electrical low-pressure impactor. In addition, engine loading and fuel consumption were also measured to calculate the thermal efficiency. Measurement results suggested that water-emulsified diesel was useful to improve the thermal efficiency and the exhaust emission of a diesel engine. Obviously, the thermal efficiency was increased about 1.2 to 19.9%. In addition, water-emulsified diesel leads to a significant reduction of nitric oxide emission (less by about 18.3 to 45.4%). However, the particle number concentration emission might be increased if the loading of the generator becomes lower than or equal to 1800 W. In addition, exhaust particle size distributions were shifted toward larger particles at high loading. The consequence of this research proposed that the water-emulsified diesel was useful to improve the engine performance and some of exhaust emissions, especially the NO emission reduction. Implications: The accumulated test results provide a good basis to resolve the corresponding pollutants emitted from a light-duty diesel engine generator. By measuring and analyzing transforms of exhaust pollutant from this engine generator, the effects of water-emulsified diesel fuel and loading on emission characteristics might be more clear. Understanding reduction of pollutant emissions during the use of water-emulsified diesel helps improve the effectiveness of the testing program.

Here we provide findings of an international research project investigating the health and wellbeing impacts of policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in urban environments.MethodsFive European and two Chinese city authorities and partner academic organisations formed the project consortium. The methodology involved modelling the impact of adopted urban climate-change mitigation transport, buildings and energy policy scenarios, usually for the year 2020 and comparing them with business as usual (BAU) scenarios (where policies had not been adopted). Carbon dioxide emissions, health impacting exposures (air pollution, noise and physical activity), health (cardiovascular, respiratory, cancer and leukaemia) and wellbeing (including noise related wellbeing, overall wellbeing, economic wellbeing and inequalities) were modelled. The scenarios were developed from corresponding known levels in 2010 and pre-existing exposure response functions. Additionally there were literature reviews, three longitudinal observational studies and two cross sectional surveys.ResultsThere are four key findings. Firstly introduction of electric cars may confer some small health benefits but it would be unwise for a city to invest in electric vehicles unless their power generation fuel mix generates fewer emissions than petrol and diesel. Second, adopting policies to reduce private car use may have benefits for carbon dioxide reduction and positive health impacts through reduced noise and increased physical activity. Third, the benefits of carbon dioxide reduction from increasing housing efficiency are likely to be minor and co-benefits for health and wellbeing are dependent on good air exchange. Fourthly, although heating dwellings by in-home biomass burning may reduce carbon dioxide emissions, consequences for health and wellbeing were negative with the technology in use in the cities studied.ConclusionsThe climate-change reduction policies reduced CO2 emissions (the most common greenhouse gas) from cities but impact on global emissions of CO2 would be more limited due to some displacement of emissions. The health and wellbeing impacts varied and were often limited reflecting existing relatively high quality of life and environmental standards in most of the participating cities; the greatest potential for future health benefit occurs in less developed or developing countries.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "bf07a9dee2629bd9036b7556ebb2cd15011d831b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2208208789", "DOI": "10.15282/ijame.11.2015.3.0184", "CorpusId": 53622751}, "title": "A Review on Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition Engine Performance using Biodiesel\u2013Diesel Blend as a Fuel", "abstract": "Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines employ a relatively new mode of combustion technology, in which auto-ignition occurs when the lean mixture of air and fuel reaches its chemical activation energy.

Simulation results indicated a strong impact of the amount and type of grass consumed on CH4 emission, with a maximum difference (across all forage types and all levels of DMI) of 49 and 77% in g CH4/kg fat and protein corrected milk (FCM) for diets with a proportion of concentrates in dietary DM of 0\u00b71 and 0\u00b74, respectively (values ranging from 10\u00b72 to 19\u00b75 g CH4/kg FCM). The lowest emission was established for early cut, high fertilized grass silage (GS) and high fertilized grass herbage (GH). The highest emission was found for late cut, low-fertilized GS. The N fertilization rate had the largest impact, followed by stage of grass maturity at harvesting and by the distinction between GH and GS. Emission expressed in g CH4/kg FCM declined on average 14% with an increase of DMI from 14 to 18 kg/day for grass forage diets with a proportion of concentrates of 0\u00b71, and on average 29% with an increase of DMI from 14 to 23 kg/day for diets with a proportion of concentrates of 0\u00b74. Simulation results indicated that a high proportion of concentrates in dietary DM may lead to a further reduction of CH4 emission per kg FCM mainly as a result of a higher DMI and milk yield, in comparison to low concentrate diets. Simulation results were evaluated against independent data obtained at three different laboratories in indirect calorimetry trials with cows consuming GH mainly. The model predicted the average of observed values reasonably, but systematic deviations remained between individual laboratories and root mean squared prediction error was a proportion of 0\u00b712 of the observed mean. Both observed and predicted emission expressed in g CH4/kg DM intake decreased upon an increase in dietary N:organic matter (OM) ratio. The model reproduced reasonably well the variation in measured CH4 emission in cattle sheds on Dutch dairy farms and indicated that on average a fraction of 0\u00b728 of the total emissions must have originated from manure under these circumstances.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "53539822314764cb880dcb2615e2c5b5b7cc4c42", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1841106173", "DOI": "10.1523/JNEUROSCI.16-11-03753.1996", "CorpusId": 12971164, "PubMed": "8642418"}, "title": "Network Analysis of Positron Emission Tomography Regional Cerebral Blood Flow Data: Ensemble Inhibition during Episodic Memory Retrieval", "abstract": "Two important objectives in the neuroscience of memory are (1) identification of neural pathways involved in memory processes; and (2) characterization of the pattern of interactions between these pathways.

Relative to a baseline reading task, decreased activity was observed in bilateral prefrontal, bilateral anterior and posterior temporal, and posterior cingulate cortices. Brain regions showing increased activity were the right prefrontal (different from deactivated regions), left anterior cingulate, and left occipital cortices, and vermis of cerebellum.

This analysis demonstrated that the influence of activated regions on deactivated regions was more negative during retrieval than during reading, confirming the inhibition hypothesis. Such confirmation could not have been made from the subtraction analysis alone because decreases can come about, at the very least, through reduction of functional influences as well as by active inhibition.

Such tasks engage a distributed brain system associated with willed action. Since willed action is impaired in many chronic schizophrenic patients we hypothesised that task performance would be associated with an abnormal pattern of blood flow. Method Positron emission tomography (PET) was applied to 18 chronic schizophrenic patients stratified into three groups on the basis of verbal fluency performance and current symptoms. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured while the patients performed (a) verbal fluency, (b) word categorisation, and (c) word repetition. Results were compared with six normal controls matched for age, sex and premorbid IQ. Analysis was restricted to six brain regions previously identified in studies of normal volunteers. Results In five brain areas, including the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the patients showed the same pattern of activation as control subjects. However, in the left superior temporal cortex, all patient groups failed to show the normal decrease in blood flow when verbal fluency was compared with word repetition. Conclusion These observations suggest that (a) chronic schizophrenic patients can show a normal magnitude of frontal activation when matched for performance with controls, and (b) they fail to show the expected reductions of activity in the superior temporal cortex.

We present here a family of conjugated dendrimers and investigate the effect of dendron branching on light emission and charge transport. We apply a number of transport measurement techniques to thin films of a conjugated dendrimer in a light-emitting diode configuration to determine the effect of chromophore spacing on charge transport. We find that the mobility is reduced by two orders of magnitude as the size of the molecule doubles with increased branching or dendrimer generation. The degree of branching allows a unique control of mobility by molecular structure. An increase in chromophore separation also results in a reduction of intermolecular interactions, which reduces the red emission tail in film photoluminescence. We find that the steady-state charge transport is well described by a simple device model incorporating the effect of generation, and use the materials to shed light on the interpretation of transient electroluminescence data.

Various measures have been proposed and explored to reduce its CO2 emissions. Among these measures, the substitution of portland cement (PC) clinker with alternative materials is arguably the most effective, and consequently is an area of high research and commercial interest. However, few studies have systematically quantified environmental impacts of alternative, i.e., non-PC, clinkers. Here, we quantify and compare environmental impacts arising from the production of binders derived from several of the most commonly investigated alternative cement systems. We show that binders derived from most of these alternative cements result in lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as other indicators of environmental impacts relative to PC binder.

While utilization of alternative cements can be environmentally beneficial, similar reductions in GHG emissions can be achieved through use of partial replacement of PC with mineral admixtures.

During chemiluminescence, each of the analogues produces a blue emission arising from the singlet excited state of the corresponding oxyluciferin monoanion. During bioluminescence two emissions are observed with coelenterate-type luciferin and some of its analogues. One of these arises fom the amide monoanion (lambda/sub max/ approximately 480 nm) and the other arises from the neutral species of oxyluciferin (lambda/sub max/ approximately 395 nm). Certain analogues produce both emissions, while others produce only the near-ultraviolet emission. Structural changes in the p-hydroxyphenyl substituent result in complete or nearly complete elimination of emission from the monoanion, resulting in over a 100-fold reduction in bioluminescence quantum yield. Structural changes in the p-hydroxybenzyl substituent do not have a significant effect on the emission spectrum but decrease the luciferase turnover number approximately 25-fold. The large decrease in the bioluminescence quantum yield observed with some of the analogues can be overcome by addition of green fluoroescent protein (GFP). GFP forms a rapid equilibrium complex with luciferase and is known to function in this system as an efficient energy-transfer acceptor (Ward, W. W., and Cormier, M. J. (1978) Phtochem.

Spectral analyses have shown that radiationless energy transfer occurs from the singlet excited state of the oxyluciferin monoanion and not from the neutral excited species. The energy-transfer data suggests that the luciferase-bound monoanion singlet excited state can be quenched by solvent and/or protein functional groups. Energy transfer to GFP can apparently favorably compete with this quenching process.

We compare economy-wide modelling of 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C scenarios with sector-focused analyses of four critical sectors that are difficult to decarbonise: aviation, shipping, road freight transport, and industry. We develop and apply a novel framework to analyse and track mitigation progress in these sectors. We find that emission reductions in the 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C scenarios of the IMAGE model come from deep cuts in CO2 intensities and lower energy intensities, with minimal demand reductions in these sectors\u2019 activity. We identify a range of additional measures and policy levers that are not explicitly captured in modelled scenarios but could contribute significant emission reductions. These are demand reduction options, and include less air travel (aviation), reduced transportation of fossil fuels (shipping), more locally produced goods combined with high load factors (road freight), and a shift to a circular economy (industry). We discuss the challenges of reducing demand both for economy-wide modelling and for policy. Based on our sectoral analysis framework, we suggest modelling improvements and policy recommendations, calling on the relevant UN agencies to start tracking mitigation progress through monitoring key elements of the framework (CO2 intensity, energy efficiency, and demand for sectoral activity, as well as the underlying drivers), as a matter of urgency. Key policy insights Four critical sectors (aviation, shipping, road freight, and industry) cannot cut their CO2 emissions to zero rapidly with technological supply-side options alone. Without large-scale negative emissions, significant demand reductions for those sectors\u2019 activities are needed to meet the 1.5\u20132\u00b0C goal. Policy priorities include affordable alternatives to frequent air travel; smooth connectivity between low-carbon travel modes; speed reductions in shipping and reduced demand for transporting fossil fuels; distributed manufacturing and local storage; and tightening standards for material use and product longevity. The COVID-19 crisis presents a unique opportunity to enact lasting CO2 emissions reductions, through switching from frequent air travel to other transport modes and online interactions. Policies driving significant demand reductions for the critical sectors\u2019 activities would reduce reliance on carbon removal technologies that are unavailable at scale.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "fb125f3898eb73ce87eac8bf52d3e048f4b5cfa3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1972294812", "DOI": "10.1063/1.3556316", "CorpusId": 119783708}, "title": "Near-Infrared Emission from Eu-Yb Doped Silicate Glasses Subjected to Thermal Reduction", "abstract": "Quantum cutting (QC) is a promising approach for enhancing the energy conversion efficiency of solar cells since it allows for conversion of one ultraviolet photon from the sun into two near-infrared photons with energy comparable to the band gap of silicon solar cells.

Three SO42\u2013 formation regimes emerge as defined by the role played by NOx. In the low-NOx regime, NOx act as catalyst for HOx, which is a major oxidant for SO2, whereas in the high-NOx regime, NO2 is a sink for HOx. Moreover, at highly elevated NOx levels, a so-called NO2-oxidant regime exists in which aqueous NO2 serves as the dominant oxidant of SO2. This regime also exists under clean fog conditions but is less prominent. Sensitivity calculations using an emission-driven box model show that the reduction of SO42\u2013 is comparably sensitive to the reduction of SO2 and NOx emissions in the NO2-oxidant regime, suggesting a co-reduction strategy. Formation of SO42\u2212 is relatively insensitive to NOx reduction in the low-NOx regime, whereas reduction of NOx actually leads to increased SO42\u2013 production in the intermediate high-NOx regime.

A number of new techniques have also been developed and existing techniques have been improved in order to evaluate CH4 mitigation technologies and prepare an inventory of GHG emissions precisely. The aim of this review is to discuss different CH4 measuring and mitigation technologies, which have been recently developed. Respiration chamber technique is still considered as a gold standard technique due to its greater precision and reproducibility in CH4 measurements. With the adoption of recent recommendations for improving the technique, the SF6 method can be used with a high level of precision similar to the chamber technique. Short-term measurement techniques of CH4 measurements generally invite considerable within- and between-animal variations. Among the short-term measuring techniques, Greenfeed and methane hood systems are likely more suitable for evaluation of CH4 mitigation studies, if measurements could be obtained at different times of the day relative to the diurnal cycle of the CH4 production. Carbon dioxide and CH4 ratio, sniffer, and other short-term breath analysis techniques are more suitable for on farm screening of large number of animals to generate the data of low CH4-producing animals for genetic selection purposes. Different indirect measuring techniques are also investigated in recent years. Several new dietary CH4 mitigation technologies have been explored, but only a few of them are practical and cost-effective. Future research should be directed toward both the medium- and long-term mitigation strategies, which could be utilized on farms to accomplish substantial reductions of CH4 emissions and to profitably reduce carbon footprint of livestock production systems.

Many emissionspolicy scenarios had (i) underestimated the rate of increase of emissions in the last decade and (ii) been unrealistically optimistic about when global emissions might peak, given the time it takes to transition out of carbon-based energy systems. A pessimistic, or some might say realistic, appraisal of the slow progress of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, also suggested that avoiding two degrees would be highly unlikely, and that the chances of warming by four degrees in this century much less unlikely than previously thought. At the same time, the Oxford-based author Mark Lynas had just published his book \u2018Six degrees: our future on a hotter planet\u2019, and he had often commented on the scarcity of any scientific literature on the nature and impacts of climate changes larger than four degrees. So, the Four degrees and beyond conference took place in September 2009, where we asked participants to specifically address the questions of (i) how probable a warming of four degrees or higher might be, (ii) what the consequences of such a warming might be for ecosystems and society, (iii) how to adapt to such large changes, and (iv) how to keep the risk of high-end climate change as low as possible.

In many cases, authors were asked to combine their separate conference contributions into a joint paper synthesizing multiple viewpoints and results.

Various combinations of volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission reductions were effective in lowering modeled peak 1-hr O3 concentrations. VOC emissions reductions alone had only a modest impact on modeled peak 8-hr O3 concentrations. Anthropogenic NOx emissions reductions of 46\u201386% of 1996 base case values were needed to reach the level of the 8-hr standard in some areas. As NOx emissions are reduced, O3 production efficiency increases, which accounts for the less than proportional response of calculated 8-hr O3 levels. Such increases in O3 production efficiency also were noted in previous modeling work for central California. O3 production in some urban core areas, such as New York City and Chicago, IL, was found to be VOC-limited. In these areas, moderate NOx emissions reductions may be accompanied by increases in peak 8-hr O3 levels.

To examine the influence of both crop cultivation and surface air temperatures (SATs) on annual global isoprene and monoterpene emissions, which can lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs), we simulated, on a monthly basis, the annual emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during the period 1854\u20132000. The model estimates were based on historical climate data such as SATs, and downward solar radiation (DSR) reproduced with an atmospheric-ocean circulation model, as well as a time series of the global distribution of cropland (to test the hypothesis that conversion of forests into croplands lowers emissions). The simulations demonstrated that global SAT, DSR, the combination of SAT and DSR, and the expansion of cropland all affected emissions. The effect of cropland expansion (i.e., forest conversion) on annual emissions during this period was larger for isoprene (~7% reduction on a global scale) than for monoterpenes (~2% reduction), mainly because of the reduction in broadleaf evergreen forests (BEFs) in Southeast Asia, which have the highest and most constant emissions of isoprene and where both temperature and radiation are high all year round. The reduction in the Amazon region and in parts of Africa, which are other primary sources of annual global isoprene emissions, but where the conversion of BEF to cropland has been much smaller than in Southeast Asia, was less remarkable, probably because the broadleaf deciduous forests and C4 grasslands in these areas have lower and seasonal emissions; hence, their conversion has less effect. On the other hand, the difference in the emission factors (e) between cropland and the other vegetation types was much lower for monoterpenes than for isoprene, although the e for cropland was generally the lowest for both compounds. Thus, the expansion of cropland also contributed to the reduction in monoterpene emissions to some degree, but had less effect. A ~5% increase in emissions due to rising SAT was more than offset by the decrease in isoprene emissions and a concurrent ~2% reduction caused by a decrease in DSR. Overall, annual global isoprene emissions in 2000 were lower than in 1854 by 13 TgC yr \u22121 , whereas annual global monoterpene emissions were higher by 2.3 TgC yr \u22121 .", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "ff3a455d57a16cfbff062140de056990e63e9480", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1966697389", "DOI": "10.1109/JSTQE.2014.2361783", "CorpusId": 36674869}, "title": "Spectroscopic Foundations of Lasers: Spontaneous Emission Into a Resonator Mode", "abstract": "We review the physics underlying the process of spontaneous emission, with a special focus on spontaneous emission into a resonator mode.

If global warming amplifies water deficit in drought\u2010prone areas, tree populations located at the driest and southernmost distribution limits (rear\u2010edges) should be particularly threatened. Here, we address these statements by analyzing and projecting growth responses to climate of three major tree species (silver fir, Abies alba; Scots pine, Pinus sylvestris; and mountain pine, Pinus uncinata) in mountainous areas of NE Spain. This region is subjected to Mediterranean continental conditions, it encompasses wide climatic, topographic and environmental gradients, and, more importantly, it includes rear\u2010edges of the continuous distributions of these tree species. We used tree\u2010ring width data from a network of 110 forests in combination with the process\u2010based Vaganov\u2013Shashkin\u2010Lite growth model and climate\u2013growth analyses to forecast changes in tree growth during the 21st century. Climatic projections were based on four ensembles CO2 emission scenarios. Warm and dry conditions during the growing season constrain silver fir and Scots pine growth, particularly at the species rear\u2010edge. By contrast, growth of high\u2010elevation mountain pine forests is enhanced by climate warming. The emission scenario (RCP 8.5) corresponding to the most pronounced warming (+1.4 to 4.8 \u00b0C) forecasted mean growth reductions of \u221210.7% and \u221216.4% in silver fir and Scots pine, respectively, after 2050. This indicates that rising temperatures could amplify drought stress and thus constrain the growth of silver fir and Scots pine rear\u2010edge populations growing at xeric sites. Contrastingly, mountain pine growth is expected to increase by +12.5% due to a longer and warmer growing season. The projections of growth reduction in silver fir and Scots pine portend dieback and a contraction of their species distribution areas through potential local extinctions of the most vulnerable driest rear\u2010edge stands.

The book starts with the philosophical meta-question of whether we should be driven by fear or hope. Given that fear can paralyze, the book focuses on positive stories of how more resilient cities can be created. After describing four scenarios of city futures, from collapse to resilience, the book moves into the detail of developing resilience, examining the built environment and transport close up, before concluding with a checklist of 10 strategic steps towards urban resilience. The book\u2019s motivating chapters raise the important question of whether (and when) major forces will drive cities worldwide towards a more resilient model. The authors argue that cities face a \u2018double whammy\u2019 of peak oil and climate change constraints. Rapidly tightening constraints on oil (\u2018peak oil\u2019) will, they maintain, be the primary driving force. The authors summon some persuasive evidence on oil supplies, and this is reinforced by recent evidence that we have reached some sort of conventional oil peak (Birol, 2011; Murray & King, 2012). Newman and co-authors also remark that there is a correspondence between the supply side (50% reduction in oil production) and the demand side (a need to cut carbon emissions globally by 50% by 2050). Nevertheless, the weight of their motivational argument centres on oil. On climate, 50% emission cuts are almost certainly not going to be enough. The developing science suggests that greenhouse emissions will probably need to be cut around 90% or more, rather than 50%, by 2050 in developed countries, which are the countries Newman and colleagues are mainly talking of. Even in 2007, the IPCC pointed to developed countries needing to make 80\u201395% cuts. The rising physical likelihood of going beyond the guardrail of 2 degrees Celsius of warming, and the increasing economic and political difficulty of keeping on the safe side of this guardrail are hugely disturbing (Anderson & Bows, 2011; Rogelj et al., 2010). On the energy supply side, opinions differ on fossil fuel reserves: scientists such as James Hansen (Hansen, 2009, Figure 22) point out that there are plenty of oil, gas and coal reserves left with which to dangerously damage our climate system. A big risk is replacement of oil by more carbonintensive substitutes such as gas from fracking or coal-based synfuels (Leaton, 2008; Proost, 2008). If emission cuts of around 90% are needed, then the imperative for early action from the climate side is much stronger, and action should be focused on all possible demand-side ways to make CO2 cuts, leaving the oil supply problem to \u2018take care of itself\u2019.

Targets defined for 2000 and 2010 (i.e., 4.6 Gg N) can be achieved, however, without reducing poultry numbers, assuming national introduction of measurements studied. Measures that reduced ammonia emission directly, i.e., introduction of low-emission housing or manure application techniques, were most effective. In 1990, N and P losses equalled 215 kg/ha for N and 31 kg/ha for P. The N loss was slightly lower than the target for 2000 (219 kg N/ha) but exceeded the target for 2010 (144 kg N/ha).

Reduction of application of artificial P fertilizer reduced P loss most effectively from 31 to 14 kg/ha. To achieve the target for 2010 (8.7 kg P/ha), additional reduction in P excretion by poultry is required.

[14C]DCMU-binding experiments now show that the number and affinity of DCMU-binding sites (normalized to chlorophyll) are equivalent in delta psbO and the wild type, suggesting equal concentrations of assembled reaction centers. A similar conclusion is reached on the basis of measurements of PSII electron transport (DPC-supported DCPIP reduction) by mutant and wild-type thylakoids. The pattern of flash O2 yield by delta psbO cells measured with a bare platinum electrode exhibits a period four oscillation (with a maximum on the third flash), indicating that the H2O-splitting enzyme in delta psbO retains the basic mechanistic features found in normal cells. However, the amplitude of these signals is smaller and more highly damped than those obtained from wild-type cells, suggesting the absence of MSP results in a higher miss probability and/or a reduction in the number of centers competent in oxygen evolution. Analysis of the rise kinetics of the ampermeric signal on the bare platinum electrode indicates that the S3-[S4]-S0 transition is retarded by at least a factor of 5 in the mutant.

Future development of global mean radiative forcing and temperature response was calculated by means of a linear response model. The range of possible effects arising from various future scenarios is analyzed, and tradeoffs between partially counteracting short- and long term effects are studied. Present-day global mean radiative forcing of short-lived species and CH4 is reduced when flying lower, whereas that of CO2 increases. The opposite effect is found for higher flight altitudes. For increasing and sustained emissions, the climate impact changes are dominated by the effect of short-lived species, yielding a reduction for lower flight altitudes and an increase for higher flight altitudes. For future scenarios involving a reduction or termination of emissions, radiative forcing of short-lived species decreases immediately, that of longer lived species decreases gradually, and respective temperature responses start to decay slowly. After disappearance of the shorter lived effects, only the counteracting CO2 effect remains, resulting in an increased climate effect for lower flight altitudes and a decrease for higher flight altitudes.

Despite its crucial role in mitigating N2O emissions, knowledge of the N2OR in the environment remains limited. Here, we report a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the nosZ gene coding the N2OR in genomes retrieved from public databases. The resulting phylogeny revealed two distinct clades of nosZ, with one unaccounted for in studies investigating N2O-reducing communities. Examination of N2OR structural elements not considered in the phylogeny revealed that the two clades differ in their signal peptides, indicating differences in the translocation pathway of the N2OR across the membrane. Sequencing of environmental clones of the previously undetected nosZ lineage in various environments showed that it is widespread and diverse. Using quantitative PCR, we demonstrate that this clade was most often at least as abundant as the other, thereby more than doubling the known extent of the overall N2O-reducing community in the environment. Furthermore, we observed that the relative abundance of nosZ from either clade varied among habitat types and environmental conditions.

The influence of traffic restrictions on the particle concentrations differed for different particle sizes. More significant effects on fine particles with diameters ranging from 40 to 500 nm have been found. Based on statistical analysis of long-term observations, under comparable weather conditions, the number concentrations of the particles in Aitken and accumulation modes seemingly were reduced by 20\u201360% when the traffic restrictions were in place. This change may be mainly due to the reduction of secondary particle contributions. However, it is worth to notice that the reduction of 60% might overestimate the effect of the measures of traffic control, due to the inherent data shortage with very high wind speeds in the comparison data population. Our size-dependent aerosol data also indicate that measures led to reductions in particulate air pollution in the optically most important diameter range, whereas further vehicle restriction measures might lead to an increase in ultrafine particle formation if the condensational sink further decreased. Assuming that there were no traffic restrictions and with normal levels of the vehicle emissions, the visibilities during the Summit would have been lower by about 20\u201345%. The fact that over 95% cases with visibility range lower than 5 km during 2004 to 2007 occurred when the local wind speed was lower than 3 m s \u22121 may suggest that the importance of the emission restrictions is highest when the wind speed is lower than 3 m s \u22121 , concerning the improvement of serious low visibility situations in Beijing.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "200cee071eb4484cd0ff70418aa26853f4ec0b15", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/tcom/Namiki83", "MAG": "2022606234", "DOI": "10.1109/TCOM.1983.1095870", "CorpusId": 62586431}, "title": "An Automatically Controlled Predistorter for Multilevel Quadrature Amplitude Modulation", "abstract": "In digital microwave transmission, the nonlinear characteristics in a high power amplifier, such as a TWT (traveling-wave tube) inhibit efficient output use.

Due to their complex biogeochemical controls and high spatial and temporal variability, current net CH4 emissions and gross CH4 processes have been difficult to quantify, and their predicted responses to climate change remain uncertain. We investigated CH4 production, oxidation, and surface emissions in Arctic polygon tundra, across a wet\u2010to\u2010dry permafrost degradation gradient from low\u2010centered (intact) to flat\u2010 and high\u2010centered (degraded) polygons. From 3 microtopographic positions (polygon centers, rims, and troughs) along the permafrost degradation gradient, we measured surface CH4 and CO2 fluxes, concentrations and stable isotope compositions of CH4 and DIC at three depths in the soil, and soil moisture and temperature. More degraded sites had lower CH4 emissions, a different primary methanogenic pathway, and greater CH4 oxidation than did intact permafrost sites, to a greater degree than soil moisture or temperature could explain. Surface CH4 flux decreased from 64 nmol m\u22122 s\u22121 in intact polygons to 7 nmol m\u22122 s\u22121 in degraded polygons, and stable isotope signatures of CH4 and DIC showed that acetate cleavage dominated CH4 production in low\u2010centered polygons, while CO2 reduction was the primary pathway in degraded polygons. We see evidence that differences in water flow and vegetation between intact and degraded polygons contributed to these observations. In contrast to many previous studies, these findings document a mechanism whereby permafrost degradation can lead to local decreases in tundra CH4 emissions.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "6ab8354398a29e2b79284766d8195ec157ebff4f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2105741469", "DOI": "10.1039/C0CY00077A", "CorpusId": 97975143}, "title": "Unique catalytic features of Ag nanoclusters for selective NOx reduction and green chemical reactions", "abstract": "The size control of Ag into nanoclusters generates unique catalytic features of Ag on automotive emission control and environmentally friendly organic reactions. Hydrogen-assisted selective catalytic reduction of NO by hydrocarbons (H2\u2013HC\u2013SCR), which is one of the promising technologies for removal of NO in the diesel engine exhausts, results in the formation of Ag clusters on alumina or zeolites and enhancement of the conversion of NO into N2. A mechanistic study using in situUV-Vis, EXAFS, and FT/IR revealed that the promotion of partial oxidation of hydrocarbons by active oxygen species is the essential role of Ag clusters. Hydrogen is suggested to be indispensable for the formation of the Ag cluster and the active oxygen. The important role of hydride on the formation of H2O2-like active chemical species on Ag clusters was confirmed by density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Knowing the high activity of Ag nanoclusters for the formation of Ag-hydride, supported Ag clusters were applied for various organic reactions. Supported Ag clusters on appropriate metal oxide, especially Al2O3, are recyclable and show very high activity and selectivity for atom-economic reactions, i.e., alcohol dehydrogenation, C\u2013C coupling reaction of alcohols, direct amide synthesis from alcohols and amines, N-benzylation of anilines with alcohols, and selective hydrogenation of nitroaromatics.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "848be4556d8c7a4bb95b6df97057ad9fbd43d15f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2570694801", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ACCRE.2016.12.005", "CorpusId": 157470125}, "title": "The Five-Year Plan: A new tool for energy saving and emissions reduction in China", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "11c3a336b5cab1bf284047a9881c81f86f6cfb54", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2014475712", "DOI": "10.1038/477162b", "CorpusId": 27713405, "PubMed": "21901000"}, "title": "Eco-indicators: Improve China's sustainability targets", "abstract": "China's national and local governments have defined various eco-indicators to promote sustainable development. Some revisions are needed to improve economic US private funder on indirect costs As vice-president of the James S. McDonnell Foundation (JSMF), I wish to clarify our position on the recovery of indirect research costs, which include overheads such as administration and building-maintenance costs (Nature 476, 385; 2011). You are correct in that the JSMF does not allow applicant institutions to include indirect costs as a component of budget requests; however, this should not be branded as a 'refusal' to fund indirect costs. The JSMF, like many private foundations, considers it inappropriate for institutions to request indirect costs from private funders. In the United States, recovery of indirect costs by universities is negotiated with federal funding agencies because most US-funded research is done on university campuses. It is unfortunate that a misunderstanding over the history and reasons for recovering indirect costs continues to strain relations between universities and private funders. A core mission of universities and education is the creation of new knowledge through research and scholarship. Grants from private funders such as the JSMF are helping universities to realize these goals; contrary to common belief, foundation grants are budget-relieving, not budget-additive. Providing for indirect costs would be incompatible with this traditional relationship. performance, environmental quality and social development. The State Council, for example, has proposed national emission-reduction targets in its latest five-year plan (2011\u201315), for which the eco-indicator is a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions per unit of gross domestic product by 40\u201345% in 2020 relative to 2005 levels (see go.nature.com/4k3mqo). Others include circular-economy indicators released by the National Development and Reform Commission in 2007 to address the environmental degradation and resource scarcity associated with rapid economic development (H. Li et al. Energy 35, 4273\u20134281; 2010); national eco-industrial park indicators set up by the environment ministry in 2006 (Y. Geng et al. sustainable-development indicators brought in by the science ministry in 2009; and national environmental-living indicators put forward this year by the housing ministry. Most of these indicators are relative. Given China's rapid economic development, a reduction in terms of ratio-based indicators may not mean a net reduction in emissions and consumption of materials or energy. There is no provision in sustainable-development plans generally for prevention-oriented indicators that reduce \u2014 rather than support \u2014 recycling and reuse.

A technical process was established in this study that is feasible for the upgrade of open dumps through restructuring. The feasibility of restructuring and the benefit of greenhouse gas emission reductions were assessed according to field surveys of five landfills and four dumps in Nanjing. The results showed that the daily processing capacities of the existing landfills have been unable to meet the growth of municipal solid waste (MSW), making restructuring of the landfills imperative. According to an assessment of the technical process, only four sites in Nanjing were suitable for upgrading. Restructuring the Jiaozishan landfill effectively reduced the leachate generation rate by 5.84% under its scale when expanded by 60.7% in 2015. CO2 emissions were reduced by approximately 55,000\u201386,000 tons per year, in which biogas power generation replaced fossil fuels Fossil fuels accounted for the largest proportion, up to 45,000\u201360,000 tons. Photovoltaic power generation on the overlying land has not only reduced CO2 emissions to 26,000\u201330,000 tons per year but has also brought in continuing income from the sale of electricity.
