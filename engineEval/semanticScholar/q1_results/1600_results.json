The dairy industry's climate change air emissions of concern are the greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide. With regard to air quality, the dairy industry's major emission contributions are particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and ammonia. The emissions of these compounds from dairies can be variable because of a number of factors including weather conditions, animal type, management, and nutrition. To evaluate and compare emissions across the diverse operations that comprise the US dairy industry, emissions should be reported per unit of output (e.g., per kg of 3.5% fat-corrected milk). Accurately modeling emissions with models that can predict the complex bio-geochemical processes responsible for emissions is critical to assess current emissions inventories and develop mitigation strategies. Improving the dairy industry's production efficiency (e.g., improvements in management, nutrition, reproduction, and cow comfort) is an effective way to reduce emissions per unit of milk. With accurate process-based models, emissions reductions due to improved production efficiency could be reported per unit of milk and predicted on a farm-to-farm basis.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "84e5870ccd126b44d079bd507b8113a3c32c752f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2171744797", "DOI": "10.1108/IJLM-02-2013-0021", "CorpusId": 17737319}, "title": "The use of ICT in road freight transport for CO2 reduction - an exploratory study of UK\u2019s grocery retail industry", "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to investigate empirically how information and communication technologies (ICT) can contribute to reduction of CO2 emissions in road freight transport and to identify opportunities for further improvements.

Drawing information from the extensive research and monitoring programs, a sequence of issue assessments demonstrated the necessity of reducing the anthropogenic emissions of acidifying pollutants, particularly sulphur dioxide (SO2). The 1991 Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement (AQA) was negotiated to reduce North American SO2 emissions by \u223c40% relative to 1980 levels by 2010, and at present, both countries have reduced emissions beyond their AQA commitment.

We hypothesized that N supply and N2O emissions would be relatively insensitive to precipitation reduction and that reducing precipitation would increase extractable NH4+ and NO3\u2212 concentrations because microbial processes continue, whereas plant N uptake diminishes with drought. In support of this hypothesis, extractable NH4+ increased by 25% overall with precipitation reduction; NH4+ also increased significantly with increasing magnitude of precipitation reduction. In contrast, N supply and extractable NO3\u2212 did not change and N2O emissions decreased with reduced precipitation. Across studies microbial biomass appeared unchanged, yet from the diversity of studies, it was clear that proportionally smaller precipitation reductions increased microbial biomass, whereas larger proportional reductions in rainfall reduced microbial biomass; there was a positive intercept (P = 0.005) and a significant negative slope (P = 0.0002) for the regression of microbial biomass versus % precipitation reduction (LnR = \u22120.009 \u00d7 (% precipitation reduction) + 0.4021).

Traffic signal timing improvement is one of the most common practices for congestion management in the United States. Although the benefits of improved signal timing for reduced fuel consumption are well documented, its effectiveness as a transportation control measure for emissions has not been clearly investigated. An empirical approach based on real-world, on-road vehicle emissions measurements was used. A total of 824 one-way runs representing 100 h and 2,020 vehicle miles of travel were conducted involving four drivers and eight gasoline-fueled light-duty vehicles on two signalized arterials in Cary, North Carolina: Walnut Street and Chapel Hill Road. Modal analyses of the data indicate that emissions rates were highest during acceleration and tend to decrease (in descending order) for cruise, deceleration, and idle. A modal approach is used to quantify the effect of arterial traffic signal timing and coordination on emissions. A key result is that signal coordination on Walnut Street yielded measurable improvements in arterial level of service and emissions reduction. For Chapel Hill Road, emissions were substantially lower under uncongested conditions [level of service (LOS) A/B] than under congested conditions (LOS D/E) for travel in the same direction at different times of day.

One scan assessed awake-baseline metabolism, and the other scan assessed metabolism during halothane anesthesia titrated to the point of unresponsiveness (mean +/- SD, expired = 0.7+/-0.2%). Scans were obtained using a GE2048 scanner and the F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose technique. Regions of interest were analyzed for changes in both absolute and relative glucose metabolism. In addition, relative changes in metabolism were evaluated using statistical parametric mapping.\n\n\nRESULTS\nAwake whole-brain metabolism averaged 6.3+/-1.2 mg x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) (mean +/- SD). Halothane reduced metabolism 40+/-9% to 3.7+/-0.6 mg x 100 g(-1) x min(-1) (P< or =0.005). Regional metabolism did not increase in any brain areas for any volunteer.

Reduction in carbon emissions in the transportation sector plays a key role in the success of China\u2019s energy conservation and emissions reduction. This paper, for the first time, analyzes the drivers of carbon emissions in China\u2019s transportation sector from 2000 to 2015 using the Generalized Divisia Index Method (GDIM). Based on this analysis, we use the improved Tapio model to estimate the decoupling elasticity between the development of China\u2019s transportation industry and carbon emissions. The results show that: (1) the added value of transportation, energy consumption and per capita carbon emissions in transportation have always been major contributors to China\u2019s carbon emissions from transportation. Energy carbon emission intensity is a key factor in reducing carbon emissions in transportation. The carbon intensity of the added value and the energy intensity have a continuous effect on carbon emissions in transportation; (2) compared with the increasing factors, the decreasing factors have a limited effect on inhibiting the increase in carbon emissions in China\u2019s transportation industry; (3) compared with the total carbon emissions decoupling state, the per capita decoupling state can more accurately reflect the relationship between transportation and carbon emissions in China. The state of decoupling between the development of the transportation industry and carbon emissions in China is relatively poor, with a worsening trend after a short period of improvement; (4) the decoupling of transportation and carbon emissions has made energy-saving elasticity more important than the per capita emissions reduction elasticity effect.

Here, we review sources and sink estimates and we present global 3D model calculations, showing that the main features of the global CH 4 distribution are well represented. The model has been used to derive the total CH 4 emission source, being about 600 Tg yr -1 . Based on published results of isotope measurements the total contribution of fossil fuel related CH 4 emissions has been estimated to be about 110 Tg yr -1 . However, the individual coal, natural gas and oil associated CH 4 emissions can not be accurately quantified. In particular natural gas and oil associated emissions remain speculative. Since the total anthropogenic CH 4 source is about 410 Tg yr -1 (\u223c70% of the total source) and the mean recent atmospheric CH 4 increase is \u223c20 Tg yr -1 an anthropogenic source reduction of 5% could stabilize the atmospheric CH 4 level. We have calculated the indirect chemical effects of increasing CH 4 on climate forcing on the basis of global 3D chemistry-transport and radiative transfer calculations. These indicate an enhancement of the direct radiative effect by about 30%, in agreement with previous work. The contribution of CH 4 (direct and indirect effects) to climate forcing during the past 150\u00a0years is 0.57W m \u22122 (direct 0.44W m \u22122 , indirect 0.13 W m \u22122 ). This is about 35% of the climate forcing by CO 2 (1.6W m \u22122 ) and about 22% of the forcing by all long-lived greenhouse gases (2.6 W m \u22122 ). Scenario calculations (IPCC-IS92a) indicate that the CH 4 lifetime in the atmosphere increased by about 25\u201330%during the past 150\u00a0years to a current value of 7.9\u00a0years. Future lifetime changes are expected to be much smaller, about 6%, mostly due to the expected increase of tropospheric O 3 (\u2192OH) in the tropics. The global mean concentration of CH 4 may increase to about 2.55\u00a0\u03bcmol/mol, its lifetime is expected to increase to 8.4\u00a0years in the year 2050. Further, we have calculated a CH 4 global warming potential (GWP) of 21 (kgCH 4 /kgCO 2 ) over a time horizon of 100\u00a0years, in agreement with IPCC (1996). Scenario calculations indicate that the importance of the climate forcing by CH 4 (including indirect effects) relative to that of CO 2 will decrease in future; currently this is about 35%, while this is expected to decrease to about 15% in the year 2050.

For this to occur, it is necessary to know the impact that individual food types have on the environment. This publication presents the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions as well as the GHG emission intensity associated with various types of poultry production in Canada for the census years 1981 to 2006. Greenhouse gas emissions were calculated using the methodology from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change adjusted for conditions in Canada. Direct emissions of CH4, N2 O, and CO2 from birds, their facilities, and the avian crop complex, corresponding to the area used to grow the crops that feed Canadian poultry, were estimated using poultry diet surveys. Between 1981 and 2006, because of the strong growth of broiler production, GHG emissions from the poultry industry increased by 40%. The main GHG was N2 O, representing approximately 57% of the total emissions. Fossil fuel CO2 accounted for approximately 38%, whereas CH4 accounted for 5%. In western Canada, GHG emission intensities decreased owing to a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels associated with the adoption of reduced- and no-tillage cropping systems, whereas in eastern Canada, the reduction was due to lower N2 O emissions. The emissions of all 3 GHG from turkeys decreased because of the more rapid turnover of a marketable product (shortened life span) in later census years.

N2O is a potent greenhouse gas and contributor to ozone layer destruction, and its release from fixed N is almost entirely controlled by microbial activities. Mitigation of N2O emissions to the atmosphere has been attributed exclusively to denitrifiers possessing NosZ, the enzyme system catalyzing N2O to N2 reduction. We demonstrate that diverse microbial taxa possess divergent nos clusters with genes that are related yet evolutionarily distinct from the typical nos genes of denitirifers. nos clusters with atypical nosZ occur in Bacteria and Archaea that denitrify (44% of genomes), do not possess other denitrification genes (56%), or perform dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA; (31%). Experiments with the DNRA soil bacterium Anaeromyxobacter dehalogenans demonstrated that the atypical NosZ is an effective N2O reductase, and PCR-based surveys suggested that atypical nosZ are abundant in terrestrial environments. Bioinformatic analyses revealed that atypical nos clusters possess distinctive regulatory and functional components (e.g., Sec vs. Tat secretion pathway in typical nos), and that previous nosZ-targeted PCR primers do not capture the atypical nosZ diversity. Collectively, our results suggest that nondenitrifying populations with a broad range of metabolisms and habitats are potentially significant contributors to N2O consumption. Apparently, a large, previously unrecognized group of environmental nosZ has not been accounted for, and characterizing their contributions to N2O consumption will advance understanding of the ecological controls on N2O emissions and lead to refined greenhouse gas flux models.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "c953933e18271e2a9aef6b40bbe09afe88c328ef", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2012523260", "DOI": "10.1212/WNL.38.12.1853", "CorpusId": 23727598, "PubMed": "3194063"}, "title": "Heterogeneous anterior\u2010posterior metabolic patterns in dementia of the Alzheimer type", "abstract": "The parietal-frontal distribution of reductions of regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rCMRglc) was studied in 32 patients with mild to severe dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT), using positron emission tomography and fluorodeoxyglucose, and was related to patterns of neuropsychological impairment.

The EU opposed American efforts to integrate international emissions trading into the Protocol. However, after 1998 the EU gradually emerged as one of the primary innovators in developing both its internal trading program as well as the international one. How do we explain the transformation of the EU position on trading? The conflict over emissions trading was intimately tied to normative debates surrounding the appropriateness of mechanisms to achieve GHG emission reductions. The EU advocated a norm requiring states to undertake domestic policy changes as the only legitimate mechanisms to reduce domestic emissions. The United States on the other hand argued that the international response had to be guided by the principle of economic efficiency. By 1998, the European Union and most of its member states had accepted that emissions trading offered a viable mechanism to reduce the costs of achieving emission reductions. However, its prior efforts to frame international emissions trading as an illegitimate mechanism constrained the EU's ability to alter its position. It was only after the United States rejected the Kyoto Protocol that the EU was able to promote emissions trading as a legitimate strategy to meet the Kyoto target. The EU reframed the issue of emissions trading from an illegitimate American attempt to shirk domestic responsibilities into a legitimate strategy to salvage the Kyoto Protocol without American participation. This shift in framing was a necessary condition to permit the EU to establish a leading position in the development of the international emissions trading mechanism.

This paper reviews the costs of various technologies and actions aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Our aim is twofold. First, we seek to provide an up-to-date summary of costs of actions that can be taken now using currently available technology. These costs focus on expenditures and emissions reductions over the life of a project compared to some business-as-usual benchmark\u2014for example, replacing coal-fired electricity generation with wind, or weatherizing a home. We refer to these costs as static because they are costs over the life of a specific project undertaken now, and they ignore spillovers. Our second aim is to distinguish between dynamic and static costs and to argue that some actions taken today with seemingly high static costs can have low dynamic costs, and vice versa. We make this argument at a general level and through two case studies, of solar panels and of electric vehicles, technologies whose costs have fallen sharply.

A large CPES is very complex considering all conventional and green distributed energy resources, dynamic data from sensors, and smart operations (e.g., charging/discharging, control, etc.) from/to the grid to reduce both cost and emission.

We examine six recent studies to produce a Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis of the carbon footprint of both shale and conventional natural gas production. The results show that the most likely upstream carbon footprints of these types of natural gas production are largely similar, with overlapping 95% uncertainty ranges of 11.0-21.0 g CO(2)e/MJ(LHV) for shale gas and 12.4-19.5 g CO(2)e/MJ(LHV) for conventional gas.

This provides significant gains in terms of exhaust emissions without the rapid reduction in combustion stability typically seen when applying EGR to a methane-fuelled engine. Presented results give the envelope of benefits from hydrogen enrichment. In parallel, the performance of a catalytic exhaust gas reforming reactor was investigated in order that it could be used as an onboard source of hydrogen-rich EGR. It was shown that sufficient hydrogen was generated with currently available prototype catalysts to allow the engine, at the operating points considered, to tolerate up to 25 per cent EGR, while maintaining a coefficient of variability of indicated mean effective pressure below 5 per cent.

We use ground-based observations of CO mixing ratios and vertical column abundances together with tropospheric NO2 columns from the GOME satellite instrument as constraints for improving the global annual emission estimates of CO and NOx for the year 1997. The agreement between concentrations calculated by the global 3-dimensional CTM IMAGES and the observations is optimized using the adjoint modelling technique, which allows to invert for CO and NOx fluxes simultaneously, taking their chemical interactions into account. Our analysis quantifies a total of 39 flux parameters, comprising anthropogenic and biomass burning sources over large continental regions, soil and lightning emissions of NOx, biogenic emissions of CO and non-methane hydrocarbons, as well as the deposition velocities of both CO and NOx. Comparison between observed, prior and optimized CO mixing ratios at NOAA/CMDL sites shows that the inversion performs well at the northern mid- and high latitudes, and that it is less efficient in the Southern Hemisphere, as expected due to the scarsity of measurements over this part of the globe. The inversion, moreover, brings the model much closer to the measured NO2 columns over all regions. Sensitivity tests show that anthropogenic sources exhibit weak sensitivity to changes of the a priori errors associated to the bottom-up inventory, whereas biomass burning sources are subject to a strong variability. Our best estimate for the 1997 global top-down CO source amounts to 2760 Tg CO. Anthropogenic emissions increase by 28%, in agreement with previous inverse modelling studies, suggesting that the present bottom-up inventories underestimate the anthropogenic CO emissions in the Northern Hemisphere. The magnitude of the optimized NOx global source decreases by 14% with respect to the prior, and amounts to 42.1 Tg N, out of which 22.8 Tg N are due to anthropogenic sources. The NOx emissions increase over Tropical regions, whereas they decrease over Europe and Asia. Our inversion results have been evaluated against independent observations from aircraft campaigns. This comparison shows that the optimization of CO emissions constrained by both CO and NO2 observations leads to a better agreement between modelled and observed values, especially in the Tropics and the Southern Hemisphere, compared to the case where only CO observations are used. A posteriori estimation of errors on the control parameters shows that a significant error reduction is achieved for the majority of the anthropogenic source parameters, whereas biomass burning emissions are still subject to large errors after optimization.

Avoided carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxide (NO(x)), and sulfur dioxide emissions were based on reductions in electricity and natural gas consumption. Lastly, experimental and fugacity-based estimates were used to quantify the NO(x) uptake by green roofs, which was translated to health benefits using U.S. Environmental Protection Agency models.

This is \u226530% higher than prior estimates, which did not include the full range of options and safeguards considered here. About half of this maximum (11.3 PgCO2e y\u22121) represents cost-effective climate mitigation, assuming the social cost of CO2 pollution is \u2265100 USD MgCO2e\u22121 by 2030. Natural climate solutions can provide 37% of cost-effective CO2 mitigation needed through 2030 for a >66% chance of holding warming to below 2 \u00b0C. One-third of this cost-effective NCS mitigation can be delivered at or below 10 USD MgCO2\u22121. Most NCS actions\u2014if effectively implemented\u2014also offer water filtration, flood buffering, soil health, biodiversity habitat, and enhanced climate resilience. Work remains to better constrain uncertainty of NCS mitigation estimates.

Significant suppression of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions following biochar amendment has been demonstrated in short\u2010term laboratory incubations by a number of authors, yet evidence from long\u2010term field trials has been contradictory. This study investigated whether biochar amendment could suppress soil GHG emissions under field and controlled conditions in a Miscanthus \u00d7 Giganteus crop and whether suppression would be sustained during the first 2 years following amendment. In the field, biochar amendment suppressed soil CO2 emissions by 33% and annual net soil CO2 equivalent (eq.) emissions (CO2, N2O and methane, CH4) by 37% over 2 years. In the laboratory, under controlled temperature and equalised gravimetric water content, biochar amendment suppressed soil CO2 emissions by 53% and net soil CO2 eq. emissions by 55%. Soil N2O emissions were not significantly suppressed with biochar amendment, although they were generally low. Soil CH4 fluxes were below minimum detectable limits in both experiments. These findings demonstrate that biochar amendment has the potential to suppress net soil CO2 eq. emissions in bioenergy crop systems for up to 2 years after addition, primarily through reduced CO2 emissions. Suppression of soil CO2 emissions may be due to a combined effect of reduced enzymatic activity, the increased carbon\u2010use efficiency from the co\u2010location of soil microbes, soil organic matter and nutrients and the precipitation of CO2 onto the biochar surface.

The ammonia monooxygenase (AMO) is the first enzyme which is involved in the oxidation of NH$ _4^+ $ to NO$ _3^ - $ in soils. The inhibition of the AMO by NIs directly decreases the nitrification rate and it reduces the NO$ _3^- $ concentration which serves as substrate for denitrification. Hence, the two main pathways of N\u2082O production in soils are blocked or their source strength is at least decreased. Although it has been shown that archaea are also able to oxidize NH\u2083, results from literature suggest that the enzymatic activity of NH\u2083oxidizing bacteria is the most important target for NIs because it was much stronger affected. The application of NIs to reduce N\u2082O emissions is most effective under conditions in which the NI remains close to the N \u2010 fertilizer. This is the case when the NI was sprayed on mineral \u2010 N fertilizer granules or thoroughly mixed with liquid fertilizers. Most serious problems of spatial separation of NI and substrate emerge on pasture soils, where N\u2082O hotspots occur under urine and to a lesser extent under manure patches. From the few studies on the effect of different NI quantities it seems that the amount of NI necessary to reduce N\u2082O emissions is below the recommendations for NI amounts in practice. NIs can improve the fertilizer value of liquid manure. For instance, the addition of NIs to slurry can increase N uptake and yield of crops when NO$ _3^ - $ \u2010 N leaching losses are reduced. It has clearly been demonstrated that NIs added to cattle slurry are very effective in reducing N\u2082O as well as NO emissions after surface application and injection of slurry into grassland soils. In flooded rice systems NIs can reduce CH\u2084emission significantly, whereas the effect on CO\u2082emission is varying. On the other hand, as an effect of the delay of nitrification by NIs, NH\u2083emission might increase when N fertilizers are not incorporated into the soil. As compared to other measures NIs have a high potential to reduce N\u2082O emissions from agricultural soils. Further, no other measure has so consistently been proofed according its efficiency to reduce N\u2082O emissions. From the published data [Akiyama et al. (2010) and more recent data from the years 2010\u20132013; 140 data sets in total] a reduction potential of approx. 35% seems realistic; however, further measurements in different management systems, particularly in regions with intense frost/thaw cycles seem necessary to confirm this reduction potential.

From the transportation operations perspective, one strategy that has gained interest worldwide is eco-driving. Eco-driving typically consists of changing a person's driving behavior based on providing general advice to the driver, such as accelerating slowly, driving smoothly, and reducing high speeds. More advanced dynamic eco-driving provides real-time advice to drivers based on changing traffic and infrastructure conditions for even greater fuel and emission savings. The concept of dynamic eco-driving takes advantage of real-time traffic sensing and infrastructure information, which can then be communicated to a vehicle with a goal of reducing fuel consumption and emissions. This article considers dynamic eco-driving in an arterial corridor with traffic control signals, where signal phase and timing (SPaT) information of traffic lights is provided to the vehicle as it drives down the corridor. The vehicle can then adjust its velocity while traveling through the corridor with the goal of minimizing fuel consumption and emissions. A dynamic eco-driving velocity planning methodology has been developed and is described herein. This algorithm has then been extensively tested in simulation, showing individual vehicle fuel consumption and CO2 reductions of around 10\u201315%, depending on corridor parameters including traffic volume, traffic speed, and other factors. This 10\u201315% improvement is realized directly by the vehicle that is equipped with this dynamic eco-driving technology and can be accomplished with very little time loss. We have also carried out an extensive analysis of the entire traffic stream under different traffic volumes and different penetration rates of the dynamic eco-driving technology. It is found that there are also significant indirect network-wide energy and emissions benefits on the overall traffic, even at low penetration rates of the technology-equipped vehicles. Based on the simulation results, the maximum fuel saving and emission reduction occur during medium traffic volumes (corresponding to traffic volume of 300 vehicles/hr/link) and with low penetration rates (5%, 10%, and 20%). Under these conditions, the total traffic energy/emissions savings typically triple what is saved from the technology-equipped vehicles alone (e.g., total 4% savings compared to 1.3% savings).

From CO2 point of view, gasoline engines suffer from an handicap in comparison to Diesel engines. Reduction of size of gasoline engine (downsizing) appears to be a promising way to improve engine efficiency and is subject to extensive research. Having a look to the long term, the aim should be to reduce by half the engine displacement volume. Calculation results from a vehicle simulation illustrate that even a so extensive downsizing will not be enough to bring the entire gasoline fleet to the requested CO2 levels. It would just be sufficient to reach the targeted levels for year 2008 for a mid-class vehicle powered by a downsized 0. 8 l engine instead of a current 1. 6l gasoline engine. Reduction of CO2 emission is in that case about 18% in warm engine conditions. Then, further improvements have to be achieved in terms of gasoline engine specific fuel consumption, especially for bigger cars. IFP has developed an innovative approach combining two energy saving technologies that are gasoline direct injection and turbocharger with renewed definition of valve timing. This has been applied on a 1. 8l engine. An unconventional combustion chamber scavenging process becomes then feasible on a turbocharged engine. Knock resistance and volumetric efficiency are improved. The close interactions between combustion, turbocharger and valve timing have been analysed and optimised. Result is a significant increase in specific engine output in terms of torque and power, while keeping low specific fuel consumption level over the whole range of engine running conditions. Specific torque obtained at 1250rpm has been progressively increased by 50% and is today close to 1. 7MPa BMEP while maximum power is now 83 kW/l with a specific fuel consumption of about 300g/kWh.

We compare a \"No Control\" scenario with global sulfur limits and regionally applied reductions. We show that, if no control measures are taken, near surface sulfate increases by about 10-20% over the main transoceanic shipping routes from 2002 to 2012. A reduction of the maximum fuel sulfur (S) content allowed within 200 nautical miles of coastal areas (\"global emission control areas\") to 0.5% or 0.1% (5000 or 1000 ppm S, respectively) results in a distinctive reduction in near surface sulfate from shipping in coastal regions compared with the year 2002. The model results also show that if emissions of nitrogen oxides (NO(x)) remain unabated, a reduction of the fuel sulfur content favors a strong increase in aerosol nitrate (NO3) which could counteract up to 20% of the decrease in sulfate mass achieved by sulfur emission reductions. The most important impact of shipping on the radiation budget is related to the modification of low maritime stratus clouds resulting in an increased reflectivity and enhanced shortwave cloud forcing. The direct aerosol effect from shipping is small. Our study shows that one can expect a less negative (less cooling) radiative forcing due to reductions in the current fuel sulfur content of ocean-going ships. The global annual average net cloud forcings due to shipping (year 2012) are in the range of -0.27 to -0.58 W/m2 with regional cooling occurring most over the remote oceans.", "year": 2009}]}
