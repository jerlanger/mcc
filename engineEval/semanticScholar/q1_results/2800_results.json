This dipolar coupling is dependent upon nanoparticle composition, distance between the fluorophore and the plasmonic surface, the transition dipole orientation, and the degree of spectral overlap between the fluorophore's absorbance/emission and the surface plasmon band of the nanoparticles. In this work, we examine the distance and plasmon wavelength dependent fluorescence of an infrared dye (\"IRDye\") bound to silica-coated gold nanorods. Nanorods with plasmon band maxima ranging from 530 to 850 nm are synthesized and then coated with mesoporous silica shells 11-26 nm thick. IRDye is covalently attached to the nanoparticle surface via a click reaction. Steady-state fluorescence measurements demonstrate plasmon wavelength and silica shell thickness dependent fluorescence emission. Maximum fluorescence intensity, with approximately 10-fold enhancement, is observed with 17 nm shells when the nanorod plasmon maximum is resonant with IRDye absorption. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals multiexponential decay and a sharp reduction in fluorescence lifetime with decreasing silica shell thickness and when the plasmon maximum is closer to IRDye absorption/emission. Control experiments are carried out to confirm that the observed changes in fluorescence are due to plasmonic interactions, is simply surface attachment. There is no change in fluorescence intensity or lifetime when IRDye is bound to mesoporous silica nanoparticles. In addition, IRDye loading is limited to maintain a distance between dye molecules on the surface to more than 9 nm, well above the F\u00f6rster radius. This assures minimal dye-dye interactions on the surface of the nanoparticles.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "606f6126f6609641240cf028e51bb38c3b6f6802", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2071919400", "DOI": "10.1021/ja404004v", "CorpusId": 207097811, "PubMed": "23745510"}, "title": "A ratiometric two-photon fluorescent probe reveals reduction in mitochondrial H2S production in Parkinson's disease gene knockout astrocytes.", "abstract": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a multifunctional signaling molecule that exerts neuroprotective effects in oxidative stress.

A model was constructed to understand the factors that influence WTP. The results indicate that the Chinese public is willing to pay CN\u00a5201.86 annually to support the policy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Participants from Beijing show the highest WTP, followed by participants from Fujian and Shandong, while those from Shanghai report the lowest WTP. The findings reveal that participants with higher income, higher satisfaction with their current life, and awareness of climate issues are willing to pay more for CO2 emissions reductions. In addition, those who are young, male and members of the Communist Party also indicate a higher WTP. The results imply that translating the public\u2019s willingness to protect climate into actions should be taken into account in China\u2019s low carbon policy.

Current global inventories of FFCO2 emissions do not directly quantify emissions at local scales; instead, spatial proxies like population density, nighttime lights, and power plant databases are used to downscale emissions from national totals. We have developed a high\u2010resolution (hourly, 1 km2) bottom\u2010up Anthropogenic Carbon Emissions System (ACES) for FFCO2, based on local activity data for the year 2011 across the northeastern U.S. We compare ACES with three widely used global inventories, finding significant differences at regional (20%) and city scales (50\u2013250%). At a spatial resolution of 0.1\u00b0, inventories differ by over 100% for half of the grid cells in the domain, with the largest differences in urban areas and oil and gas production regions. Given recent U.S. federal policy pull backs regarding greenhouse gas emissions reductions, inventories like ACES are crucial for U.S. actions, as the impetus for climate leadership has shifted to city and state governments. The development of a robust carbon monitoring system to track carbon fluxes is critical for emissions benchmarking and verification. We show that existing downscaled inventories are not suitable for urban emissions monitoring, as they do not consider important local activity patterns. The ACES methodology is designed for easy updating, making it suitable for emissions monitoring under most city, regional, and state greenhouse gas mitigation initiatives, in particular, for the small\u2010 and medium\u2010sized cities that lack the resources to regularly perform their own bottom\u2010up emissions inventories.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "902366f1044f406a9e9ea3b6df1f3e71bcbb1e7c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1729129009", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.880384", "CorpusId": 26937407}, "title": "Should Developing Countries Participate in the Clean Development Mechanism Under the Kyoto Protocol?

First, if the cheapest abatment measures are implemented for CDM projects, developing countries may be left with only more expensive measures when they have to meet their own commitments in the future (the so-called low-hanging fruits issue). Second, a choice must be made on the type of baseline against which emission reductions are measured : an absolute baseline or a relative (to output) one (the baseline issue). The purpose of this paper is to study the interactions between these two issues from the point of view of the developing country. Two major results are obtained. First, when possible future commitments for developing countries and irreversibility of abatement measures are taken into account, we show that the industry where CDM projects are implemented enjoys large profits under an absolute baseline than under a relative one.

Therefore, atmospheric concentration observations over populated regions would provide the ultimate proof if sustained emissions changes have occurred. The most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), also shows large natural concentration variations, which need to be disentangled from anthropogenic signals to assess changes in associated emissions. This is in principle possible for the fossil fuel CO2 component (FFCO2) by high-precision radiocarbon (14C) analyses because FFCO2 is free of radiocarbon. Long-term observations of 14CO2 conducted at two sites in south-western Germany do not yet reveal any significant trends in the regional fossil fuel CO2 component. We rather observe strong inter-annual variations, which are largely imprinted by changes of atmospheric transport as supported by dedicated transport model simulations of fossil fuel CO2. In this paper, we show that, depending on the remoteness of the site, changes of about 7\u201326% in fossil fuel emissions in respective catchment areas could be detected with confidence by high-precision atmospheric 14CO2 measurements when comparing 5-year averages if these inter-annual variations were taken into account.

On the basis of the emissions results, an estimation of the change in the motor vehicle emissions of the metropolitan area of Mexico city was calculated for the year 2010 if ethanol were to be used instead of MTBE, and the outcome was a considerable decrease in all regulated and toxic emissions, despite the growing motor vehicle population.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "c839655944018b8cabac9a8635ff3c62d1597d4a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2164536739", "DOI": "10.1034/J.1600-0668.2000.010002082.X", "CorpusId": 21608448, "PubMed": "11980106"}, "title": "Formation of strong airway irritants in terpene/ozone mixtures.", "abstract": "The American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) mouse bioassay, which quantifies airway irritation from reduction in the respiratory rate, was used to find evidence for the formation of highly irritating substances in reactions of ozone with terpenes (common indoor volatile organic compounds (VOCs)).

Fugitive emissions of hydrocarbons are difficult to measure and quantify. Currently these emissions are estimated based on standard emission factors for the type and use of equipment installed. Differential absorption light detection and ranging (DIAL) can remotely measure concentration profiles of hydrocarbons in the atmosphere up to several hundred meters from the instrument. When combined with wind speed and direction, downwind vertical DIAL scans can be used to calculate mass fluxes of the measured gas leaving the site. Using a mobile DIAL unit, a survey was completed at a Canadian refinery to quantify fugitive emissions of methane, C2+ hydrocarbons, and benzene and to apportion the hydrocarbon emissions to the various areas of the refinery. Refinery fugitive emissions as measured with DIAL during this demonstration study were 1240 kg/hr of C2+ hydrocarbons, 300 kg/hr of methane, and 5 kg/hr of benzene. Storage tanks accounted for over 50% of the total emissions of C2+ hydrocarbons and benzene. The coker area and cooling towers were also significant sources. The C2+ hydrocarbons emissions measured during the demonstration amounted to 0.17% of the mass of the refinery hydrocarbon throughput for that period. If the same loss were repeated throughout the year, the lost product would represent a value of US$3.1 million/yr (assuming US$40/bbl). The DIAL-measured hourly emissions of C2+ hydrocarbons were 15 times higher than the emission factor estimates and gave a different perspective on which areas of the refinery were the main source of emissions.

Using seasonal-average conditions and assuming thermodynamic equilibrium, we find that the conditions for PM2.5 to respond nonlinearly to sulfate reductions are common in the eastern United States in winter, occurring at half of the sites considered, and uncommon in summer, due primarily to the influence of temperature. Accounting for diurnal and intraseasonal variability, we find that seasonal-average conditions provide a reasonable indicator of the time-averaged PM2.5 response.

Employing four widely-used energy-economy models, we explore the direct and indirect effects of alternative proposals on the global economy. We also examine the implications for atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We begin by examining an AOSIS-like proposal in which OECD countries agree to reduce CO2 emissions by 20% below 1990 levels by a specified date. We find that implementing such a proposal could be quite costly. Not surprisingly, OECD countries would be hardest hit. Their costs could be as high as several percent of GDP. The analysis also shows that because of trade effects, non-OECD countries would likely incur costs even when reductions are confined to the OECD. An economic slowdown in the OECD would affect the full range of developing country exports, and hence their economic growth. This would likely be the case for both oil-importing and oil-exporting developing countries. We then explore alternatives that are apt to be quite similar in terms of environmental benefits, but allow for flexibility in where and when emission reductions are made. We find that costs could be substantially reduced through international cooperation and the optimal timing of emission reductions. Indeed, such flexibility can reduce costs by more than 80%, potentially saving the international community trillions of dollars in mitigation costs. We find that reliance on more flexible alternatives reduces costs more effectively than adopting weaker, but still inflexible, commitments.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "0c469c19a13788e08747a8d2cb0e0c11b7105999", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "3492365", "MAG": "2064675148", "DOI": "10.1371/journal.pone.0047981", "CorpusId": 10165870, "PubMed": "23144840"}, "title": "The Impact of Climate Change on Indigenous Arabica Coffee (Coffea arabica): Predicting Future Trends and Identifying Priorities", "abstract": "Precise modelling of the influence of climate change on Arabica coffee is limited; there are no data available for indigenous populations of this species.

In this method, emission factors are normalized to fuel consumption; vehicle activity is measured by the amount of diesel fuel consumed. For the San Francisco Bay Area during summer 1996, on-road heavy-duty diesel trucks were estimated at the upper bound to emit 110 x 103 kg/day of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 3.7 x 103 kg/day of fine black carbon (BC) particles.

As far as updated emission sources are concerned, emphasis is put on those which presently constitute issues : emissions from fluidized bed combustors, emissions caused by non catalytic selective NO reduction by ammonia and urea injection, N2O emissions caused by the use of automotive three-way catalysts as well as emissions from nitric acid and adipic acid manufacturing and from municipal wastes and sewage sludges incineration. Comments on the 1991 OEDC/IPCC Report mainly emphasize : (1) the surprising absence of emission factors from stationary combustion facilities and the inadequacy of some of the scarcely presented data, (2) the strange ignorance of the important effect of aging of three-way catalysts on the emission of N2O from gasoline vehicles. These omissions are the more surprising since reliable information in these two fields were already available at the period the OEDC Report was issued and or revised. For the assessment of adequate N2O control technologies, there is an urgent need for further R&D work.

In the context of controlling greenhouse gas emissions, the directive on a Europewide trading scheme for large immobile sources may be perceived as one of the most important milestones in recent years. Prior to its start, however, a number of very specific design features have to be agreed upon. In the political discussion, the question of how to allocate emission rights is considered as one of the most important issues. So far, a distribution (almost) free of charge is the option of choice. An aspect that has interestingly attracted little attention in the past is the question of how to allocate emission rights over time. This may for example be done on the basis of a constant reference metric, as for example emissions in a certain fixed year, or on the basis of a rolling metric as for example emissions in the previous year. The following paper analyses four different allocation options in multi-period emissions trading that are currently discussed in the European context. The four options are applied for the electricity sector. A power market close to reality with five different types of power plants (hydro, nuclear, lignite, coal and gas) is simulated over two periods. The paper distinguishes between a market effect of emissions trading on the one hand and compliance costs for meeting the emission reduction obligation on the other. The market effect results from a price increase which is due to the fact that opportunity costs for using allowances, though received free of charge, must be considered. However, only compliance costs and not opportunity costs materialise as costs in the profit and loss account of utilities. It turns out that the electricity sector as a whole gains from the introduction of the instrument due to the increase of the electricity price. With regard to the different allocation options, it is found that utilities have different preferences depending on the fuel used.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "33f524eb4e1e781beb41b610077939ba948585e9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2068602928", "DOI": "10.2514/1.C031680", "CorpusId": 51914694}, "title": "Tradeoff Between Contrail Reduction and Emissions in United States National Airspace", "abstract": "This paper describes a class of strategies for reducing persistent contrail formation with the capability of trading o between contrails and aircraft induced emissions.

Beyond the EU directive on the energy performance of buildings", "abstract": "UNLABELLED\nGOAL SCOPE AND BACKGROUND: The European Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings which came into force 16 December 2002 will be implemented in the legislation of Member States by 4 January 2006. In addition to the aim of improving the overall energy efficiency of new buildings, large existing buildings will become a target for improvement, as soon as they undergo significant renovation. The building sector is responsible for about 40% of Europe's total end energy consumption and hence this Directive is an important step for the European Union in order that it should reach the level of saving required by the Kyoto Agreement. In this the EU is committed to reduce CO2 emissions relative to the base year of 1990 by 8 per cent, by 2010. But what will be the impact of the new Directive, how large could be the impacts of extending the obligation for energy efficiency retrofitting towards smaller buildings? Can improvement of the insulation offset or reduce the growing energy consumption from the increasing installation of cooling installations? EURIMA, the European Insulation Manufacturers Association and EuroACE, the European Alliance of Companies for Energy Efficiency in Buildings, asked Ecofys to address these questions.\n\n\nMETHODS\nThe effect of the EPB Directive on the emissions associated with the heating energy consumption of the total EU 15 building stock has been examined in a model calculation, using the Built Environment Analysis Model (BEAM), which was developed by Ecofys to investigate energy saving measures in the building stock. The great complexity of the EU-15 building stock had to be simplified by examining five standard buildings with eight insulation standards, which are assigned to building age and renovation status. Furthermore, three climatic regions (cold, moderate, warm) were distinguished for the calculation of the heating energy demand. This gave a basic 210 building types for which the heating energy demand and CO2 emissions from heating were calculated according to the principles of the European Norm EN 832.\n\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe model calculations demonstrates that the main contributor to the total heating related CO2 emissions of 725 Mt/a from the EU building stock in 2002 is the residential sector (77%) while the remaining 23% originates from non-residential buildings. In the residential sector, single-family houses represent the largest group responsible for 60% of the total CO2 emissions equivalent to 435 Mt/a. THE TECHNICAL POTENTIAL: If all retrofit measures in the scope of the Directive were realised immediately for the complete residential and non-residential building stock the overall CO2 emission savings would add up to 82 Mt/a. An additional saving potential compared to the Directive of 69 Mt/a would be created if the scope of the Directive was extended to cover retrofit measures in multi-family dwellings (200-1000 m2) and non-residential buildings smaller than 1000 m2 used floor space. In addition including the large group of single-family dwellings would lead to a potential for additional CO2 emission reductions compared to the Directive of 316 Mt/a. TEMPORAL MOBILIZATION OF THE POTENTIAL: Calculations based on the building stock as it develops over time with average retrofit rates demonstrated that regulations introduced following the EPB Directive result in a CO2 emissions decrease of 34 Mt/a by the year 2010 compared to the business as usual scenario. Extending the scope of the EPB Directive to all residential buildings (including single and multi-family dwellings), the CO2 emission savings potential over the 'business as usual' scenario could be doubled to 69 Mt/a in the year 2010. This creates an additional saving potential compared to the Directive of 36 Mt/a. COOLING DEMAND: The analysis demonstrated that in warm climatic zones the cooling demand can be reduced drastically by a combination of lowering the internal heat loads and by improved insulation. With the reduction of the heat loads to a moderate level the cooling demand, e.g. of a terraced house located in Madrid, can be reduced by an additional 85% if the insulation level is improved appropriately.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis study demonstrates that the European Directive on Energy Performance of Buildings will have a significant impact on the CO2 emissions of the European building stock. The main saving potential lies in insulation of the existing building stock. Beyond this, CO2 emissions could, however, be greatly reduced if the scope of the Directive were to be extended to include retrofit of smaller buildings.\n\n\nRECOMMENDATION AND PERSPECTIVE\nThe reductions should be seen in relation to the remaining gap of 190 Mt CO2 eq. per annum between the current emission levels of EU-15 and the target under the Kyoto-Protocol for the year 2010. The energy and industrial sector will probably contribute only a fraction of this reduction via the newly established EU emissions trading scheme and connected projects under the flexible mechanism. In addition, the traffic sector is likely to continue its growth path leading to a widening of the gap. Thus, there is likely to be considerable pressure on the EU building sector to contribute to the EU climate targets beyond what will be achieved by means of the current EPB Directive. Legislators on the EU and national level are therefore advised to take accelerated actions to tap the very significant emission reduction potentials available in the EU building stock.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "9a2fc5074c9fd2898f59f92b1c8864bfbaed0085", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2152936445", "CorpusId": 13434492}, "title": "Experimental Studies on the Combustion and Emission Characteristics of a Diesel Engine Fuelled with Used Cooking Oil Methyl Esterand its Diesel Blends", "abstract": "Transesterified vegetable oils (biodiesel) are promising alternative fuel for diesel engines.

This study provides improved methanol emission estimates on the global scale, in particular for the largest methanol source, the terrestrial biosphere, and for biomass burning. To this purpose, one complete year of spaceborne measurements of tropospheric methanol columns retrieved for the first time by the thermal infrared sensor IASI aboard the MetOp satellite are compared with distributions calculated by the IMAGESv2 global chemistry-transport model. Two model simulations are performed using a priori biogenic methanol emissions either from the new MEGANv2.1 emission model, which is fully described in this work and is based on net ecosystem flux measurements, or from a previous parameterization based on net primary production by Jacob et al. (2005). A significantly better model performance in terms of both amplitude and seasonality is achieved through the use of MEGANv2.1 in most world regions, with respect to IASI data, and to surface- and air-based methanol measurements, even though important discrepancies over several regions are still present. As a second step of this study, we combine the MEGANv2.1 and the IASI column abundances over continents in an inverse modelling scheme based on the adjoint of the IMAGESv2 model to generate an improved global methanol emission source. The global optimized source totals 187 Tg yr \u22121 with a contribution of 100 Tg yr \u22121 from plants, only slightly lower than the a priori MEGANv2.1 value of 105 Tg yr \u22121 . Large decreases with respect to the MEGANv2.1 biogenic source are inferred over Amazonia (up to 55 %) and Indonesia (up to 58 %), whereas more moderate reductions are recorded in the Eastern US (20\u201325 %) and Central Africa (25\u201335 %). On the other hand, the biogenic source is found to strongly increase in the arid and semi-arid regions of Central Asia (up to a factor of 5) and Western US (factor of 2), probably due to a source of methanol specific to these ecosystems which is unaccounted for in the MEGANv2.1 inventory. The most significant error reductions achieved by the optimization concern the derived biogenic emissions over the Amazon and over the Former Soviet Union. The robustness of the derived fluxes to changes in convective updraft fluxes, in methanol removal processes, and in the choice of the biogenic a priori inventory is assessed through sensitivity inversions.

The average model year of the vehicle fleet was about one year newer each successive summer. Large reductions in pollutant emissions were measured in the tunnel over the course of this study, due to a combination of RFG and fleet turnover effects.

Electricity demand in all provinces is highly variable throughout the day, as well as during the year. In order to achieve a good match between electricity demand and generation, a mix of base, intermediate and peaking load power plants is used, which uses different fuel sources. When a renewable energy technology or an energy efficiency measure that results in electricity savings is implemented on a regional, provincial and national scale, the electricity savings reflect in the peak (marginal) electricity generation. Thus, the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction due to the reduction in electricity generation corresponds to the fuel used to generate the electricity at the margin. In Canada, the fuel used for marginal electricity generation varies from province to province and from hour to hour. To estimate the reduction in GHG emissions due to reducing electricity generation at the margin, it is necessary to have information on the fuel mix used to generate the marginal electricity for each province on a suitable time scale. With such information, it is possible to estimate a marginal GHG emission intensity factor for each province, which would provide the amount of GHG emissions produced as result of producing 1\u2009kWh of electricity on the margin. However, such information is regarded confidential by most electric utilities and is not made public. In this paper, methodologies are presented to estimate the GHG intensity factors (GHGIFs) for marginal electricity generation for each province of Canada based on the information available in the public domain. The GHGIFs developed for each province are also presented, which are expected to be valid within the next 5\u2010year horizon.

In this study, thermodynamic analyses and optical/imaging diagnostics were employed in an optically-accessible, heavy-duty Dl diesel engine to examine the in-cylinder mechanisms by which fuel/air premixing affects engine-out NO x emissions. Exhaust NO and NO x emissions were measured and correlated with observations of soot luminosity and jet penetration as the intake-temperature and injection timing were varied The engine was operated at low-load conditions, for which the premixed burn was a significant fraction of the total heat released. As injection timing was retarded to the misfire limit, dramatic reductions in soot luminosity accompanied increased exhaust NO x emissions, even as the calculated adiabatic flame temperatures decreased. Since thermal NO formation increases with temperature, the reduction of the cooling effect of soot radiative heat transfer may increase the actual flame temperature, and thus NO formation, as the jets become less sooty. Compression heating of the reactant mixture by the large pressure rise during premixed combustion was found to be insufficient to explain exhaust NO x trends. Compression of post-flame burned-gases, however, could be responsible for some aspects of the correlation.

Objective: This study investigates the historical trend in the long-term exposure to PM2.5 and PM2.5-related premature mortality (PM2.5-mortality) and its response to changes in emission that occurred during 1990\u20132010 across the northern hemisphere. Implications for future trends in human exposure to air pollution in both developed and developing regions of the world are discussed. Methods: We employed the integrated exposure\u2013response model developed by Health Effects Institute to estimate the PM2.5-mortality. The 1990\u20132010 annual average PM2.5 concentrations were obtained from the simulations using the WRF-CMAQ model. Emission mitigation efficiencies of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and primary PM are estimated from the PM2.5-mortality responses to the emission variations. Results: Estimated PM2.5-mortalities in East Asia and South Asia increased by 21% and 85% respectively, from 866,000 and 578,000 in 1990, to 1,048,000 and 1,068,000 in 2010. PM2.5-mortalities in developed regions (i.e., Europe and high-income North America) decreased substantially by 67% and 58% respectively. Conclusions: Over the past two decades, correlations between population and PM2.5 have become weaker in Europe and North America due to air pollution controls but stronger in East Asia due to deteriorating air quality. Mitigation of primary PM appears to be the most efficient way for increasing health benefits (i.e., providing the largest mortality reduction per unit emissions). However, reductions in emissions of NH3 are needed to maximize the effectiveness of NOx emission controls.

The plausibility of sensitivity simulations is evaluated against multiple independent lines of observation, including natural archives and direct measurements of present-day environmental Hg concentrations. It has been previously reported that pre-industrial enrichment recorded in sediment and peat disagree by more than a factor of 10. We find this difference is largely erroneous and caused by comparing peat and sediment against different reference time periods. After correcting this inconsistency, median enrichment in Hg accumulation since pre-industrial 1760 to 1880 is a factor of 4.3 for peat and 3.0 for sediment. Pre-industrial accumulation in peat and sediment is a factor of \u223c 5 greater than the precolonial era (3000 BC to 1550 AD). Model scenarios that omit atmospheric emissions of Hg from early mining are inconsistent with observational constraints on the present-day atmospheric, oceanic, and soil Hg reservoirs, as well as the magnitude of enrichment in archives.

To date, (18)F-dopa has been the gold standard to measure presynaptic dopaminergic function in PD, but this tracer might overestimate the rate of neuronal death in PD because its uptake also depends on dopamine turnover rather than exclusively on the density of dopaminergic terminals in the striatum. The latter might be assessed using newly developed ligands of the membrane dopamine transporter.\n\n\nOBJECTIVE\nTo compare the striatal uptakes of (18)F-dopa and (76)Br-FE-CBT, a dopamine transporter ligand, in patients with PD.\n\n\nPATIENTS AND METHODS\nThe striatal uptakes of (76)Br-FE-CBT and (18)F-dopa were compared using positron emission tomography in 10 patients with early PD and 8 with advanced PD. Correlation of uptakes with motor performance was investigated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe reduction in (76)Br-FE-CBT binding to 43% of control values was more severe than the reduction in (18)F-dopa uptake (63% of control values) in the putamen of patients with early PD. No significant difference was found between either tracer's uptake in the putamen of patients with advanced PD. Motor performance was highly correlated to (18)F-dopa uptake, whereas correlation to (76)Br-FE-CBT binding was weak.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nUptake of (18)F-dopa may be up-regulated in early PD, suggesting a compensatory increase of dopamine synthesis in surviving dopaminergic terminals.

Because of this, particulate emissions were subjected to restrictions and various emission-reduction technologies were developed. It is ironic that some of these technologies led to reductions in the legislated total particulate mass while neglecting the number of particles. Focusing on the mass is not necessarily correct, because it might well be that not the mass but the number of particles and the characteristics of them (size, composition) have a higher impact on health. To eliminate the threat of diesel particulate matter, essentially absolute filtration in combination with the oxidation of all emitted hydrocarbons is what will be required. After two decades of development, the first filters will soon be introduced on a large scale. Many different problems had to be overcome; it was especially important that the filter was robust and its regeneration was controllable. The key technology to controllable regeneration is oxidation catalysis, which is the main area of focus in this review. Catalytic filter regeneration is very complex, something which is apparent in the main aspects of catalysis (i.e., activity, stability, and selectivity). Complications are that the process conditions can be very transient and that the temperatures are usually low. It is shown that the oxidation catalyst cannot be examined isolated from the total system. Within the margins of size restrictions and an engine's service life, essentially all particulate matter should be trapped, the filter should be regenerated safely, no toxic by-products should be formed, and the catalyst should not alter the filtration characteristics, and vice versa. The exhaust conditions of passenger cars are not favorable for continuous regeneration strategies, because the best strategy seems to be periodic regeneration with the aid of a catalyst. This concept is not passive, which makes it complex and expensive. The best technology for filter regeneration with trucks and buses seems to be continuous regeneration. Using the NO x present in the exhaust gas for soot oxidation amounts to a simple and robust concept. A future limitation might be the minimal required NO x :soot ratio; it is not sure if this will be met in future engines. Alternatively, a low-temperature catalyst may be developed that does not require NO x . Developing such an advanced catalytic trap will be one of the major challenges of catalytic filter engineering.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "156e5b268f9ad929b6fd111fedc41c2137625c01", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "6386658", "MAG": "2915027405", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1814297116", "CorpusId": 67859037, "PubMed": "30733299"}, "title": "Interpreting contemporary trends in atmospheric methane", "abstract": "Atmospheric methane plays a major role in controlling climate, yet contemporary methane trends (1982\u20132017) have defied explanation with numerous, often conflicting, hypotheses proposed in the literature.

Explanations for the increases and stabilization have invoked changes in tropical wetlands, livestock, fossil fuels, biomass burning, and the methane sink. Contradictions in these hypotheses arise because our current observational network cannot unambiguously link recent methane variations to specific sources. This raises some fundamental questions: (i) What do we know about sources, sinks, and underlying processes driving observed trends in atmospheric methane? (ii) How will global methane respond to changes in anthropogenic emissions? And (iii), What future observations could help resolve changes in the methane budget? To address these questions, we discuss potential drivers of atmospheric methane abundances over the last four decades in light of various observational constraints as well as process-based knowledge. While uncertainties in the methane budget exist, they should not detract from the potential of methane emissions mitigation strategies.

In the deep air-staged combustion (f{sub M} = 0.6), the effect of coal fineness is smaller, and the burnout air position has a stronger effect. When the primary combustion air is stable, NOx emissions increase with increasing burnout air. This proves that, in the burnout zone, coal char is responsible for the discharge of fuel-nitrogen that is oxidized to NOx. The measurementmore\u00a0\u00bb of secondary air staging in a burnout zone can help inhibit the oxidization of NO caused by nitrogen release. Air-staged combustion has little effect on the burnout of anthracite coal, which proves to be suitable for air-staged combustion. 31 refs., 11 figs., 1 tab.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "992963cc9c4d7e7cda8461557b71c5698d4b31a8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2346539216", "DOI": "10.1098/rsta.2014.0415", "CorpusId": 12879655, "PubMed": "26438280"}, "title": "Insights into low-latitude cloud feedbacks from high-resolution models", "abstract": "Cloud feedbacks are a leading source of uncertainty in the climate sensitivity simulated by global climate models (GCMs). Low-latitude boundary-layer and cumulus cloud regimes are particularly problematic, because they are sustained by tight interactions between clouds and unresolved turbulent circulations. Turbulence-resolving models better simulate such cloud regimes and support the GCM consensus that they contribute to positive global cloud feedbacks. Large-eddy simulations using sub-100\u2009m grid spacings over small computational domains elucidate marine boundary-layer cloud response to greenhouse warming. Four observationally supported mechanisms contribute: \u2018thermodynamic\u2019 cloudiness reduction from warming of the atmosphere\u2013ocean column, \u2018radiative\u2019 cloudiness reduction from CO2- and H2O-induced increase in atmospheric emissivity aloft, \u2018stability-induced\u2019 cloud increase from increased lower tropospheric stratification, and \u2018dynamical\u2019 cloudiness increase from reduced subsidence. The cloudiness reduction mechanisms typically dominate, giving positive shortwave cloud feedback. Cloud-resolving models with horizontal grid spacings of a few kilometres illuminate how cumulonimbus cloud systems affect climate feedbacks. Limited-area simulations and superparameterized GCMs show upward shift and slight reduction of cloud cover in a warmer climate, implying positive cloud feedbacks.

It is shown that DPTZ\u2010DBTO2 has minimal singlet\u2013triplet energy splitting due to its near\u2010rigid molecular geometry. However, the electronic coupling between the local triplet (3LE) and the charge transfer states, singlet and triplet, (1CT, 3CT), and the effect of dynamic rocking of the D\u2013A units about the orthogonal geometry are crucial for efficient TADF to be achieved. In solvents with low polarity, the guest emissive singlet 1CT state couples directly to the near\u2010degenerate 3LE, efficiently harvesting the triplet states by a spin orbit coupling charge transfer mechanism (SOCT). However, in solvents with higher polarity the emissive CT state in DPTZ\u2010DBTO2 shifts below (the static) 3LE, leading to decreased TADF efficiencies. The relatively large energy difference between the 1CT and 3LE states and the extremely low efficiency of the 1CT to 3CT hyperfine coupling is responsible for the reduction in TADF efficiency. Both the electronic coupling between 1CT and 3LE, and the (dynamic) orientation of the D\u2013A units are thus critical elements that dictate reverse intersystem crossing processes and thus high efficiency in TADF.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "2af5a03b09f827f3bb56173d283aea5927550ef2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2318362946", "DOI": "10.1021/es202211w", "CorpusId": 3827632, "PubMed": "21970673"}, "title": "Unearthing potentials for decarbonizing the U.S. aluminum cycle.", "abstract": "Global aluminum demand is anticipated to triple by 2050, by which time global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are advised to be cut 50-85% to avoid catastrophic climate impacts.

Theoretical and realistic reduction potentials were identified and quantified. The total GHG emissions for the U.S. aluminum cycle in 2006 amount to 38 Mt CO(2)-equivalence. However, the U.S. has increasingly relied on imports of aluminum embodied in various products. The in-use stock is still growing fast in most product categories, which limits current scrap availability for recycling and emissions saving. Nevertheless, there is still large emission mitigation potential through recycling. The potentials from \"100% old scrap collection\" and \"low emission energy\" were each calculated to be higher than all process technology potential. Total emissions will decrease dramatically and mitigation priorities will change significantly under a stock saturation situation as much more old scrap becomes available for recycling.

Methodologically the work was based on life cycle assessment (LCA) beginning from the extraction of raw materials and ending with the delivery of gutted fish to the retailers or for further processing. The environmental performances of production methods with different feeds, feed coefficients and technical emission reduction measures were assessed. The environmental impact assessment revealed that atmospheric emissions - originating mainly from the feed raw material production, feed manufacturing and transportation - make only a minor contribution to the total environmental impacts caused by the production of rainbow trout in Finland. Phosphorus and nitrogen emissions from fish farms to waters are the most significant emissions from the point of view of the total environmental impacts. By using new, environmentally friendly feeds with increased feed efficiency it is possible to decrease the nitrogen and phosphorus loads significantly. Technical measures to decrease nutrient emissions to the waters reduce the phosphorus load but have only a minor effect on nitrogen.

On the one hand, recent projections of the OECD show that Turkey has a yearly GDP growth potential of over 7%. On the other hand, recent projections of UNDP and World Bank indicate that the level of CO2 emission is going to rise six-fold by 2025 with respect to the level of emissions in 1990. It is a great challenge to both meet the growth target and keep the CO2 under control. Thereupon, this paper tries to unfold factors that explain CO2 emissions by undertaking a complete decomposition analysis for Turkey over the period 1980-2003. The analysis shows, as is common to relatively fast growing economies, that the biggest contributor to the rise in CO2 emissions is the expansion of the economy (scale effect). The carbon intensity and the change in composition of the economy, which nearly move in tandem, also contribute to the rise in CO2 emissions, albeit at a slower rate. The energy intensity of the economy, which is decreasing, is responsible for a modest reduction in CO2 emissions. Hence, in congruence with the scale effect, we do not find a decoupling of carbon emissions and economic growth in Turkey over the period 1980-2003.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "a93a9d679f0d0a27d4895e0e28e1cd28dd4b8214", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2187241946", "CorpusId": 110834709}, "title": "Energy consumption and GHG emissions of six biofuel pathways by LCA in China", "abstract": "This paper presents life-cycle-analysis (LCA) energy consumption (EC) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of China\u2019s current six biofuel pathways, which are: corn-derived ethanol (CE); cassava-derived ethanol (KE); sweet sorghum-derived ethanol (SE); soybean-derived bio-diesel (SB); jatropha fruit-derived bio-diesel (JB); and used cooking oil (UCO)-derived bio-diesel (UB).

In this article, we evaluate various policy choices by setting up six scenarios in a China computable general equilibrium model. To investigate the optimal choice determining which sectors should be covered, criteria such as emission scale, trade intensity, emission intensity and complex indicators of optimal carbon revenue are compared. In addition, double counting of electricity production- and consumption-related carbon emissions is also included as a specific scenario, as it might be utilized to deal with the problem of price regulation of the electricity sector in China. The simulation result shows that the emissions intensity scenario can achieve the best emissions reduction effect, and the optimal carbon revenue scenario can achieve the best economic and welfare effect. All scenarios show that partial coverage will not lead to significant inter-sectoral carbon leakage in the current construction of the national ETS. Although the double counting of emissions from the electricity sector can lead to the lowest inter-sectoral carbon leakage rate, its emissions reduction effect, economic effect and welfare effect are all inferior to the other scenarios.

However, emissions of benzene were unaffected by the presence of biodiesel and emissions of naphthalene actually increased for B100. This suggests that the unsaturated FAME in soy-biodiesel can react to form aromatic rings in the diesel combustion environment. Methyl acrylate and methyl 3-butanoate were observed as significant species in the exhaust for B20 and B100 and may serve as markers of the presence of biodiesel in the fuel.

These are compared, on both an absolute and a per-capita basis, to scenarios for emissions from the developed and developing worlds generated by socio-economic models under the assumption that actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions are not taken. Need and equity have provided strong arguments for developing countries to request that the developed world takes the lead in controlling its emissions, while permitting the developing countries in the meantime to use primarily fossil fuels for their development. Even with major and early control of CO2 emissions by the developed world, limiting concentration to 450 ppm implies that the developing world also would need to control its emissions within decades, given that we expect developing world emissions would otherwise double over this time. Scenarios leading to CO2 concentrations of 550 ppm exhibit a reduction of the developed world's per-capita emission by about 50% over the next 50 years.
