Heterogeneous ice nuclei such as mineral dust, metallic, and soot particles, and some crys- talline solids within partially soluble aerosols are suspected to modulate cirrus properties. Among those, the role of ubiquitous soot particles is perhaps the least understood. Be- cause aviation is a major source of upper tropospheric soot particles, we put emphasis on ice formation in dispersing air- craft plumes. The effect of aircraft soot on cirrus formation in the absence of contrails is highly complex and depends on a wide array of emission and environmental parameters. We use a microphysical-chemical model predicting the for- mation of internally mixed, soot-containing particles up to two days after emission, and suggest two principal scenarios: high concentrations of original soot emissions could slightly increase the number of ice crystals; low concentrations of particles originating from coagulation of emitted soot with background aerosols could lead to a significant reduction in ice crystal number. Both scenarios assume soot particles to be moderate ice nuclei relative to cirrus formation by homo- geneous freezing in the presence of few efficient dust ice nu- clei. A critical discussion of laboratory experiments reveals that the ice nucleation efficiency of soot particles depends strongly on their source, and, by inference, on atmospheric aging processes. Mass and chemistry of soluble surface coat- ings appear to be crucial factors. Immersed soot particles tend to be poor ice nuclei, some bare ones nucleate ice at low supersaturations. However, a fundamental understand- ing of these studies is lacking, rendering extrapolations to atmospheric conditions speculative. In particular, we can- not yet decide which indirect aircraft effect scenario is more plausible, and options suggested to mitigate the problem re- main uncertain.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "d793a3297d4177fde1a0555a998d6e94f114f0cf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2032639456", "DOI": "10.1021/es300474z", "CorpusId": 10216438, "PubMed": "22642698"}, "title": "Sediment records of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the continental shelf of China: implications for evolving anthropogenic impacts.", "abstract": "Sources, compositions, and historical records of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sediment cores collected from the Yellow Sea and the South China Sea were analyzed to investigate the influence of anthropogenic activities. The occurrence of PAHs was mainly derived from various combustion sources, especially the combustion of biomass and domestic coal. Uniform composition of sedimentary PAHs (52-62% of phenanthrene, benzo[b]fluoranthene, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene, and benzo[g,h,i]perylene) suggested air-borne mixtures intractable to degradation. The concentrations of the sum of 15 PAHs (16 priority pollutants designed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency minus naphthalene; designed as \u03a3(15)PAH) in Yellow Sea sediment cores were generally higher than those in the South China Sea. The profiles of \u03a3(15)PAH concentrations recorded in the sediment cores closely followed historical socioeconomic development in China. In general, \u03a3(15)PAH concentrations started to increase from the background pollution level posed by agricultural economy at the turn of 20th century. In addition, a \u03a3(15)PAH concentration reduction was observed during the Chinese Civil War (1946-1949) and Great Cultural Revolution (1966-1976), suggesting them as setbacks for economic development in Chinese history. Increasing PAH emissions as a result of increasing coal combustion associated with the rapid urbanization and industrialization since the implementation of the Reform and Open Policy (since 1978) accounted for the fast growth of \u03a3(15)PAH concentrations in sediment cores. The decline of \u03a3(15)PAH concentrations from subsurface maximum until sampling time was inconsistent with current-day economic development in China, and may possibly suggest emission reductions due to decreasing proportional use of domestic coal and increasing consumption of cleaner energies (natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas).", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "fb13c516c860abf24b0149a2313448f2982a37f8", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/anor/YangADYL19", "MAG": "2765757312", "DOI": "10.1007/S10479-017-2682-1", "CorpusId": 125401113}, "title": "Carbon emission allocation in China based on gradually efficiency improvement and emission reduction planning principle", "abstract": "Carbon emission allocation in China is one of the most important research fields in recent years.

This will require \u201crapid and far-reaching transitions in land, energy, industry, buildings, transport, and cities\u201d. The challenge falls on all sectors, especially energy production and industry. In this regard, the recent progress and future challenges of greenhouse gas emissions and energy supply are first briefly introduced. Then, the current situation of the steel industry is presented. Steel production is predicted to grow by 25\u201330% by 2050. The dominant iron-making route, blast furnace (BF), especially, is an energy-intensive process based on fossil fuel consumption; the steel sector is thus responsible for about 7% of all anthropogenic CO2 emissions. In order to take up the 2050 challenge, emissions should see significant cuts. Correspondingly, specific emissions (t CO2/t steel) should be radically decreased. Several large research programs in big steelmaking countries and the EU have been carried out over the last 10\u201315 years or are ongoing. All plausible measures to decrease CO2 emissions were explored here based on the published literature. The essential results are discussed and concluded. The specific emissions of \u201cworld steel\u201d are currently at 1.8 t CO2/t steel. Improved energy efficiency by modernizing plants and adopting best available technologies in all process stages could decrease the emissions by 15\u201320%. Further reductions towards 1.0 t CO2/t steel level are achievable via novel technologies like top gas recycling in BF, oxygen BF, and maximal replacement of coke by biomass. These processes are, however, waiting for substantive industrialization. Generally, substituting hydrogen for carbon in reductants and fuels like natural gas and coke gas can decrease CO2 emissions remarkably. The same holds for direct reduction processes (DR), which have spread recently, exceeding 100 Mt annual capacity. More radical cut is possible via CO2 capture and storage (CCS). The technology is well-known in the oil industry; and potential applications in other sectors, including the steel industry, are being explored. While this might be a real solution in propitious circumstances, it is hardly universally applicable in the long run. More auspicious is the concept that aims at utilizing captured carbon in the production of chemicals, food, or fuels e.g., methanol (CCU, CCUS). The basic idea is smart, but in the early phase of its application, the high energy-consumption and costs are disincentives. The potential of hydrogen as a fuel and reductant is well-known, but it has a supporting role in iron metallurgy. In the current fight against climate warming, H2 has come into the \u201climelight\u201d as a reductant, fuel, and energy storage. The hydrogen economy concept contains both production, storage, distribution, and uses. In ironmaking, several research programs have been launched for hydrogen production and reduction of iron oxides. Another global trend is the transfer from fossil fuel to electricity. \u201cGreen\u201d electricity generation and hydrogen will be firmly linked together. The electrification of steel production is emphasized upon in this paper as the recycled scrap is estimated to grow from the 30% level to 50% by 2050. Finally, in this review, all means to reduce specific CO2 emissions have been summarized. By thorough modernization of production facilities and energy systems and by adopting new pioneering methods, \u201cworld steel\u201d could reach the level of 0.4\u20130.5 t CO2/t steel and thus reduce two-thirds of current annual emissions.

Application of a discount rate to these long run marginal costs yields an estimate of allowance price close to that observed today. Several factors have contributed to the delay in bearing these costs, and helped to reduce their magnitude.

This paper addresses many aspects of the debate over the appropriate approach for obtaining reductions in NOx emissions from point sources beyond those called for in the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. Data on NOx control technologies and their associated costs, spatial models linking NOx emissions and air quality, and benefit estimates of the health effects of changes in ozone and PM concentrations are combined to allow an analysis of alternative policies in thirteen states in the eastern United States. The first part of the study examines the cost and other consequences of a command-and-control approach embodied in the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) NOx SIP call, which envisions large reductions in NOx from electric utilities and other point sources. These results are compared to the alternative policy of ton-for-ton NOx emissions trading, similar to that proposed by the EPA for utilities. We find that emission reduction targets can be met at roughly 50% cost savings under a trading program when there are no transaction costs. The paper examines a number of alternative economic incentive policies that have the potential to improve upon the utility NOx trading plan proposed by EPA, including incorporation of other point sources in the trading program, incorporation of ancillary PM benefits to ozone reductions in the trading program, and trading on the basis of ozone exposures that incorporates the spatial impact of emissions on ozone levels. For the latter analysis, we examine spatially differentiated permit systems for reducing ozone exposures under different and uncertain meteorological conditions, including an empirical analysis of the trade-off between the reliability (or degree of certainty) of meeting ozone exposure reduction targets and the cost of NOx control. Finally, several policies that combine costs and health benefits from both ozone and PM reductions are compared to command-and-control and single-pollutant trading policies. The first of these is a full multipollutant trading system that achieves a health benefit goal, with the interpollutant trading ratios governed by the ratio of unit health benefits of ozone and PM. Then, a model that maximizes aggregate benefits from both ozone and PM exposure reductions net of the costs of NOx controls is estimated. EPA\u2019s program appears to be reasonably cost-effective compared to all of the other more complex trading programs we examined. It may even be considered an optimal policy that maximizes net aggregate benefits if the high estimate of benefits is used in which mortality risk is linked to ozone exposure.

Preservation treatments considered in the analysis include thin overlay, chip seal, and crack seal that are typically used by highway agencies. At construction stage, there are significant differences in emissions caused by various preservation treatments mainly due to different raw material components and manufacturing processes. At use stage, fuel consumptions vary significantly depending on tire rolling resistance that is affected by pavement surface characteristics. The Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions at the use stage were predicted using the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) and pavement roughness models obtained from Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) program. The results show that pavement preservation brings significant environmental benefit in reduction of CO2 emission due to the improved pavement surface condition despite the emission generated at construction stage. Thin overlay produces the highest life-cycle reduction in CO2 emission due to the large International Roughness Index (IRI) jump after treatment; while crack seal has the lowest reduction of CO2 emission. The optimum application timing of preservation treatment was determined for chip seal and thin overlay assuming one-time treatment applied before reaching the IRI threshold.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "5bbd6cb7ae0619e4b10016cb068415e0fff0a180", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2120971106", "DOI": "10.5194/HESS-14-783-2010", "CorpusId": 55745335}, "title": "Impact of climate change on freshwater ecosystems: a global-scale analysis of ecologically relevant river flow alterations.", "abstract": "Abstract. River flow regimes, including long-term average flows, seasonality, low flows, high flows and other types of flow variability, play an important role for freshwater ecosystems. Thus, climate change affects freshwater ecosystems not only by increased temperatures but also by altered river flow regimes. However, with one exception, transferable quantitative relations between flow alterations and ecological responses have not yet been derived. While discharge decreases are generally considered to be detrimental for ecosystems, the effect of future discharge increases is unclear. As a first step towards a global-scale analysis of climate change impacts on freshwater ecosystems, we quantified the impact of climate change on five ecologically relevant river flow indicators, using the global water model WaterGAP 2.1g to simulate monthly time series of river discharge with a spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees. Four climate change scenarios based on two global climate models and two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios were evaluated. We compared the impact of climate change by the 2050s to the impact of water withdrawals and dams on natural flow regimes that had occurred by 2002. Climate change was computed to alter seasonal flow regimes significantly (i.e. by more than 10%) on 90% of the global land area (excluding Greenland and Antarctica), as compared to only one quarter of the land area that had suffered from significant seasonal flow regime alterations due to dams and water withdrawals. Due to climate change, the timing of the maximum mean monthly river discharge will be shifted by at least one month on one third on the global land area, more often towards earlier months (mainly due to earlier snowmelt). Dams and withdrawals had caused comparable shifts on less than 5% of the land area only. Long-term average annual river discharge is predicted to significantly increase on one half of the land area, and to significantly decrease on one quarter. Dams and withdrawals had led to significant decreases on one sixth of the land area, and nowhere to increases. Thus, by the 2050s, climate change may have impacted ecologically relevant river flow characteristics more strongly than dams and water withdrawals have up to now. The only exception refers to the decrease of the statistical low flow Q90, with significant decreases both by past water withdrawals and future climate change on one quarter of the land area. However, dam impacts are likely underestimated by our study. Considering long-term average river discharge, only a few regions, including Spain, Italy, Iraq, Southern India, Western China, the Australian Murray Darling Basin and the High Plains Aquifer in the USA, all of them with extensive irrigation, are expected to be less affected by climate change than by past anthropogenic flow alterations. In some of these regions, climate change will exacerbate the discharge reductions, while in others climate change provides opportunities for reducing past reductions. Emissions scenario B2 leads to only slightly reduced alterations of river flow regimes as compared to scenario A2 even though emissions are much smaller. The differences in alterations resulting from the two applied climate models are larger than those resulting from the two emissions scenarios. Based on general knowledge about ecosystem responses to flow alterations and data related to flow alterations by dams and water withdrawals, we expect that the computed climate change induced river flow alterations will impact freshwater ecosystems more strongly than past anthropogenic alterations.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "f64615715709013d4474178000813a2bd7e7034e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2167300931", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-10-7603-2010", "CorpusId": 10834188}, "title": "Air quality during the 2008 Beijing Olympics: secondary pollutants and regional impact", "abstract": "Abstract. This paper presents the first results of the measurements of trace gases and aerosols at three surface sites in and outside Beijing before and during the 2008 Olympics. The official air pollution index near the Olympic Stadium and the data from our nearby site revealed an obvious association between air quality and meteorology and different responses of secondary and primary pollutants to the control measures. Ambient concentrations of vehicle-related nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) at an urban site dropped by 25% and 20\u201345% in the first two weeks after full control was put in place, but the levels of ozone, sulfate and nitrate in PM2.5 increased by 16%, 64%, 37%, respectively, compared to the period prior to the full control; wind data and back trajectories indicated the contribution of regional pollution from the North China Plain. Air quality (for both primary and secondary pollutants) improved significantly during the Games, which were also associated with the changes in weather conditions (prolonged rainfall, decreased temperature, and more frequent air masses from clean regions). A comparison of the ozone data at three sites on eight ozone-pollution days, when the air masses were from the southeast-south-southwest sector, showed that regional pollution sources contributed >34\u201388% to the peak ozone concentrations at the urban site in Beijing. Regional sources also contributed significantly to the CO concentrations in urban Beijing. Ozone production efficiencies at two sites were low (~3 ppbv/ppbv), indicating that ozone formation was being controlled by VOCs. Compared with data collected in 2005 at a downwind site, the concentrations of ozone, sulfur dioxide (SO2), total sulfur (SO2+PM2.5 sulfate), carbon monoxide (CO), reactive aromatics (toluene and xylenes) sharply decreased (by 8\u201364%) in 2008, but no significant changes were observed for the concentrations of PM2.5, fine sulfate, total odd reactive nitrogen (NOy), and longer lived alkanes and benzene. We suggest that these results indicate the success of the government's efforts in reducing emissions of SO2, CO, and VOCs in Beijing, but increased regional emissions during 2005\u20132008.

Gas exchanges and histo-anatomical parameters were measured to specifically understand whether ozone indirectly affects the anatomy and physiology of leaves. Three leaf classes were investigated: (1) those expanding above the cuvettes (A leaves); (2) those already developed inside the cuvettes (B leaves) and (3) those developing inside the cuvettes, since the beginning of the ozone treatment (C leaves). The anatomy and morphology of the first leaf developing outside the cuvette (A1) were strongly affected by ozone, whereas photosynthesis was not perturbed. However, in leaves of ozone-treated plants developing after A1, a large reduction of starch accumulation was observed, which suggests a delayed biosynthesis, or a very rapid export of starch toward other sinks. Isoprene emission was higher and isoprene synthase messenger RNA was more expressed in ozone-treated A1 leaves than in control leaves with similar ontogeny. This indicates that isoprene synthesis is stimulated by ozone, and reveals that isoprene emission is controlled at a transcriptional level. Leaves already developed inside the cuvette (B leaves) rapidly sensed ozone stress, which inhibited photosynthesis, stomatal conductance and isoprene emission. The observation that new leaves were developing inside the cuvettes during the treatment (C leaves) suggests that resistance to ozone may be acquired by plants. Leaves C showed a more packed and thinner mesophyll than controls of similar development, which may help reduce ozone penetration inside cells. They also showed a lower photosynthesis in comparison to controls and to other leaf classes, probably because of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity limitation, as inferred from photosynthesis response to intercellular CO2. However, isoprene emission was slightly stimulated also in C leaves, confirming that a large fraction of carbon is invested into isoprene formation under ozone stress.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "9c9c726f3ea66f91b715f2510d71f2ed5761f1fa", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1991138550", "DOI": "10.1149/1.2050072", "CorpusId": 94799643}, "title": "Modeling of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell Performance with an Empirical Equation", "abstract": "An empirical equation [E = E{sub 0} {minus} b log i {minus} Ri {minus} m exp (in)] was shown to fit the experimental cell potential (E) vs. current density (i) data for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), at several temperatures, pressures, and oxygen compositions in the cathode gas mixture.

Analysis based on threshold effect model", "abstract": "With the increasing pressure on China to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, it is crucial to clarify the effect of implementing environmental regulations and their impact on the region. Many studies have focused on the linear, rather than nonlinear, relationship between environmental regulation and CO2 emissions. The exploration of nonlinear relations is conducive to the in-depth study of policy effects and regional differences of environmental regulations in China. To ensure effective CO2 emission reductions, regional differences in CO2 emissions in China should also be considered. In this study 30 provinces of China were divided into three different regions according to their level of economic development from 2004 to 2015. Taking the energy intensity and foreign direct investment (FDI) as threshold variables, a threshold model was used to examine the relationship between environmental regulation and CO2 emissions. It was found that environmental regulation has a threshold effect on CO2 emissions, with significant differences among the eastern, central, and western regions. Environmental regulations in the eastern region were ineffective for curbing CO2 emissions, while the energy intensity was in the middle and low threshold range. However, FDI had a promotional effect on CO2 emissions. In the central region, environmental regulations reduced CO2 emissions under the influence of energy intensity and FDI. In the western region, environmental regulations could not mitigate CO2 emissions when the energy intensity and FDI were used as the threshold variables. It was concluded that a diverse range of measures for CO2 reduction should be adopted according to the local economic situation.Graphical abstract", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "10262cb980821bb8a4f1eb2f056498fa995383c0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2129229929", "DOI": "10.1111/gcb.13099", "CorpusId": 30948922, "PubMed": "26386203"}, "title": "Greenhouse gas emissions and global warming potential of traditional and diversified tropical rice rotation systems", "abstract": "Global rice agriculture will be increasingly challenged by water scarcity, while at the same time changes in demand (e.g. changes in diets or increasing demand for biofuels) will feed back on agricultural practices.

For a comprehensive assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) balances, we measured methane (CH4)/nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and agronomic parameters over 2.5 years in double\u2010rice cropping (R\u2010R) and paddy rice rotations diversified with either maize (R\u2010M) or aerobic rice (R\u2010A) in upland cultivation.

Moreover, for practices including upland crops, CH4 emissions in the subsequent wet season with paddy rice were reduced by 54\u201360%.

Measurements of soil organic carbon (SOC) contents before and 3 years after the introduction of upland crop rotations indicated a SOC loss for the R\u2010M system, while for the other systems SOC stocks were unaffected. This trend for R\u2010M systems needs to be followed as it has significant consequences not only for the GWP balance but also with regard to soil fertility. Economic assessment showed a similar gross profit span for R\u2010M and R\u2010R, while gross profits for R\u2010A were reduced as a consequence of lower productivity.

Two barriers must be overcome to enable the use of such information for real-time process diagnosis and control. The first barrier is the large number of measurements in wide-spectrum scans, which hinders real-time processing. The second barrier is the need to understand and estimate not only process conditions, but also what is happening on the surface of wafer, particularly the spatial uniformity of the etch. This paper presents a diagnostic method that utilizes multivariable OES data collected during plasma etch to estimate spatial asymmetries in commercially available reactor technology. Key elements of this method are: first, the use of principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and second, regression and function approximation to correlate observed spatial wafer information (i.e., line width reduction) with these reduced measurements. Here we compare principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares (PLS), and principal components combined with multilayer perceptron neural networks (PCA/MLP) for this in-situ estimation of spatial uniformity. This approach has been verified for a 0.35-/spl mu/m aluminum etch process using a Lam 9600 TCP etcher. Models of metal line width reduction across the wafer are constructed and compared: the root mean square prediction errors on a test set withheld from training are 0.0134 /spl mu/m for PCR, 0.014 /spl mu/m for PLS, and 0.016 /spl mu/m for PCA/MLP.

These findings suggest that the main short-term role of E. vaginatum in the ecosystem is simply as a conduit for CH4 release.

Agricultural soils are the most important sources for the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O), which is produced and emitted from soils also at low temperatures. The processes behind emissions at low temperatures are still poorly known. Snow is a good insulator and it keeps soil temperature rather constant. To simulate the effects of a reduction in snow depth on N2O emission in warming climate, snow pack was removed from experimental plots on three different agricultural soils (sand, mull, peat). Removal of snow lowered soil temperature and increased the extent and duration of soil frost in sand and mull soils. This led to enhanced N2O emissions during freezing and thawing events. The cumulative emissions during the first year when snow was removed over the whole winter were 0.25, 0.66 and 3.0 g N2O-N m\u22122 yr\u22121 in control plots of sand, mull and peat soils, respectively. In the treatment plots, without snow cover, the respective cumulative emissions were 0.37, 1.3 and 3.3 g N2O-N m\u22122 yr\u22121. Shorter snow manipulation during the second year did not increase the annual emissions. Only 20% of the N2O emission occurred during the growing season. Thus, these results highlight the importance of the winter season for this exchange and that the year-round measurements of annual N2O emissions from boreal soils are integral for estimating their N2O source strength. N2O accumulated in the frozen soil during winter and the soil N2O concentration correlated with the depth of frost but not with the winter N2O emission rates per se.

Although straw covers have been proven to generally reduce gaseous emissions, more knowledge is needed regarding how age, moisture content, and microbiological development of the straw cover affect the emissions of odor and odorants to develop recommendations for the practical use of straw covers. This study compiles data on odor concentration and odorants above swine slurry covered by straw of different ages and moisture contents, during a 9 wk laboratory scale study. The results showed that aged straw covers significantly reduced emissions of ammonia (by 99%), dimethyl sulfide (by 81%), phenol (82%), p-cresol (by 95%), skatole (by 98%), and benzylalcohol (by 97%), while no significant differences were found between uncovered and covered slurry for emission of odor, hydrogen sulfide, volatile fatty acids, dimethyl disulfide, and indole. The moisture content of the straw cover neither affected emissions of odor nor odorants. This study suggests that the main mechanism for odor and odorants emission reduction from straw covered slurry is as a physical barrier and not as a biofilter.

In 2004, treatments of urea or urea + zeolite\u2010DCD were applied randomly to pairs of plots following grazing in late autumn. Both treatments received urea at a rate of 50 kg N ha\u20101, while the latter treatment also included an application of granular zeolite/DCD at 42 kg ha\u20101 (DCn\u2122: 10 kg ha\u20101 DCD). In 2005, the same treatments were applied following grazing in early and late autumn and early spring. Measurements of N2O emissions were made at frequent intervals following treatment application using a standardised soil cover technique. Large variability in N2O emissions and soil mineral N levels were measured, due to the variable nature of urine N return by grazing animals. Nevertheless, the results clearly showed that the granular zeolite/DCD significantly reduced N2O emissions from grazed pasture from 1.0 to 0.3 kg N ha\u20101, 3.7 to 0.7 kg N ha\u20101 and 2.9 to 0.3 kg N ha\u20101 for the three measurement periods.

Differing approaches and interpretations have fuelled a debate about the environmental merit of biofuels, and consequently about the level of policy support that can be justified. This paper estimates and compares emissions from plausible supply chains for lignocellulosic ethanol production, exemplified using data specific to the UK and Sweden. The common elements that give rise to the greatest greenhouse gas emissions are identified and the sensitivity of total emissions to variations in these elements is estimated. The implications of including consequential impacts including indirect land-use change, and the effects of selecting alternative allocation methods on the interpretation of results are discussed.ResultsWe find that the most important factors affecting supply chain emissions are the emissions embodied in biomass production, the use of electricity in the conversion process and potentially consequential impacts: indirect land-use change and fertiliser replacement. The large quantity of electricity consumed during enzyme manufacture suggests that enzymatic conversion processes may give rise to greater greenhouse gas emissions than the dilute acid conversion process, even though the dilute acid process has a somewhat lower ethanol yield.ConclusionThe lignocellulosic ethanol supply chains considered here all lead to greenhouse gas savings relative to gasoline An important caveat to this is that if lignocellulosic ethanol production uses feedstocks that lead to indirect land-use change, or other significant consequential impacts, the benefit may be greatly reduced.Co-locating ethanol, electricity generation and enzyme production in a single facility may improve performance, particularly if this allows the number of energy intensive steps in enzyme production to be reduced, or if other process synergies are available. If biofuels policy in the EU remains contingent on favourable environmental performance then the multi-scale nature of bioenergy supply chains presents a genuine challenge. Lignocellulosic ethanol holds promise for emission reductions, but maximising greenhouse gas savings will not only require efficient supply chain design but also a better understanding of the spatial and temporal factors which affect overall performance.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "36586ad579d7003bb9249997c1237156113a635f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2504337349", "DOI": "10.1109/TASC.2016.2594800", "CorpusId": 13285039}, "title": "HTS Applied to Power System: Benefits and Potential Analysis for Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction", "abstract": "Energy conservation and emission reduction is a critical task for power systems.

Superoxide and the hydroxyl radical play a significant role in a variety of inflammatory diseases, and probes that can detect these reactive oxygen species (ROS) have tremendous potential as medical diagnostics and research tools. Fluorescent sensors for superoxide and the hydroxyl radical, such as dihydroethidium (DHE), have been developed; however, they have had limited applicability because of their spontaneous autoxidation, rapid photobleaching, low emission wavelengths, and multiple reaction products with ROS. New chemical probes for superoxide and the hydroxyl radical are therefore greatly needed. Herein, we present a new family of fluorescent ROS sensors, termed the hydrocyanines, which can be synthesized in one step from the commercially available cyanine dyes and can detect superoxide and the hydroxyl radical in living cells, tissue samples, and for the first time in vivo. We anticipate widespread interest in the hydrocyanines given their physical/ chemical characteristics and ease of synthesis. The synthesis of and mechanism by which hydrocyanines image ROS are shown in Figure 1a. The hydrocyanines are synthesized by reducing the iminium cations of the cyanine dyes with NaBH4. Hydrocyanines detect ROS through fluorescent imaging; they are weakly fluorescent because of their disrupted p conjugation; however, oxidation with either superoxide or the hydroxyl radical dramatically increases their fluorescence by regenerating their extended p conjugation. Figure 1b demonstrates the proof of principle of this methodology. Hydro-IR-676 has minimal fluorescence; however, oxidation with superoxide causes a 100-fold increase in its fluorescence intensity. The cyanine dyes comprise a family of approximately 40 dyes, and the reduction methodology presented in Figure 1a was used to synthesize several new fluorescent ROS sensors, which have the physical and chemical properties needed to detect intracellular and extracellular ROS, both in vitro and in vivo. For example, five new ROS sensors, termed hydro-Cy3, hydro-Cy5, hydroCy7, hydro-IR-783, and hydro-ICG, were synthesized by reduction with NaBH4 (Table 1). These molecules have negligible fluorescence, as a result of reduction of their iminium cations; however, after reaction with either superoxide or the hydroxyl radical, they fluoresce at 560, 660, 760, 800, and 830 nm, respectively (see Table 1 and the Supporting Information for details). Hydro-Cy3, hydro-Cy5, hydro-IR676, and hydro-Cy7 have the physical properties needed to detect intracellular ROS, in that they are initially membranepermeable molecules; however, oxidation with intracellular ROS converts them into charged and membrane-impermeable molecules, which should accumulate within cells that are overproducing ROS.

Dual-mode photoemission can be generated for exciting at a wavelength of about 360 nm. The resulting colour of luminescence, ranging from orange/red to blue, can be controlled by adjusting the annealing temperature and, hence, the degree of crystallization: with increasing annealing temperature, the ratio of luminescence intensities related to Eu3+ and Eu2+ species, respectively, varies as a result of increasing degree of Eu3+-reduction as well as distinct changes in the optical scattering behaviour of the obtained glass ceramic. At the same time, the bandwidth of Eu2+-related photoemission increases from 87 to 154 nm.

While quantum-size effects are commonly expected and easily predicted, size reduction also causes more atoms to be closer to the surface. Here we show that intensity relations of below-band-gap and band-edge luminescence in ZnO nanowires depend on the wire radius. Assuming a surface layer wherein the surface-recombination probability is 1 (surface-recombination approximation), we explain this size effect in terms of bulk-related to surface-related material-volume ratio that varies almost linearly with the radius. This relation supports a surface-recombination origin for the deep-level luminescence we observe. The weight of this surface-luminescence increases as the wire radius decreases at the expense of the band-edge emission. Using this model, we obtain a radius of 30 nm, below which in our wires surface-recombination prevails.

To evaluate the possible increase in atmospheric CO, with and without fertilization, we adopt a \u201cbusiness-as-usual\u201d scenario of anthropogenic CO, emission. Such increase is computed from the atmospheric pC0, in the oceanatmosphere total C system as it responds to this emission scenario. Assuming completely successful Fe fertilization, we calculate an 8% atmospheric CO2 reduction for a case with a 3 cm2 s-I vertical diffusivity and 17.4 Sv upwelling flux, as derived from distribution of bomb-14C in the ocean. Hence, if atmosphericpC0, reaches 800 patm in the next century, the maximum possible reduction is - 64 patm. Doubling of upwelling flux to 34.8 Sv results in a reduction of 96 palm. If we assume the surface area of the Antarctic Ocean is 16% of the total ocean area instead of 10% as used in the standard case, the reduction is - 7 1 patm. These results are independent of the respiration function adopted. As we hold the surface water PO, content at a near-zero value, it makes no difference at what depth the organic material is oxidized (or whether it falls to the bottom and accumulates). Changes in the gas exchange rate over the Antarctic Ocean also do not have a significant effect on the magnitude of atmospheric CO, drawdown. Doubling the gas exchange rate in the Antarctic region after fertilization results in a reduction of 68 patm. Doubling of vertical diffusivity to 6 cm2 s-l in Antarctic deep water yields a reduction of 75 patm. The key parameters are the rate of upwelling in the Antarctic and the fate of this upwelled water. The length of the productive season influences the extent ofpC0, reduction. For 8 months of productive fertilization our model yields a reduction of 60 patm, for 4 months a reduction of 50 patm, and for 2 months a reduction of 40 patm. The maximum 0, consumption in our standard case is estimated to be 133 pmol kg -I at a depth of 600 m. However, 0, consumption depends on the reoxidation function in the subsurface water. If the organic flux reoxidizes completely in the upper 2,000 m, the maximum consumption of 0, at 500 m could reach 500 pmol kg-\u2018.

A global activity of this scale can be assumed to have a substantial impact on the environment. In this contribution, five major aspects such as the change of LUCC and the use of energy and its associated impacts had been recognized. Recently, the impact of tourism on environment and climate attracts the attention of international organizations and societies in pace with rapid development of tourism industry. Energy consumption and CO2 emissions in tourism sector are becoming a hot spot of international tourism research in recent five years. The use of energy for tourism can be divided according to transport-related purposes (travel to, from and at the destination) and destination-related purposes excluding transports (accommodation, food, tourist activities, etc.). In addition, the transports, accommodation and foods are related to many other industries which are dependent on energy. Thus, the estimations of energy consumption and CO2 emissions in tourism sector have become a worldwide concern. Tourism in China grows rapidly, and the number of domestic tourists was 1902 million in 2009. Energy use and its impact on the environment increase synchronously with China\u2019s tourism. It is necessary to examine the relationship between energy use and CO2 emissions. In this article, a preliminary attempt was applied to estimate the energy consumption and CO2 emissions from China\u2019s tourism sector in 2008. Bottom-up approach, literature research and mathematical statistics technology were also adopted. According to the calculations, Chinese tourism-related may have consumed approximately 428.30 PJ of energy in 2008, or about 0.51% of the total energy consumptions in China. It is estimated that CO2 emissions from tourism sector amounted to 51.34 Mt, accounting for 0.86% of the total in China. The results show that tourism is a low-carbon industry and also a pillar industry coping with global climate change, energy-saving and CO2 emission reduction. Based on this, the authors suggested that tourism should become an important field in low-carbon economic development.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "0b2fd7e15c067b1db694562ce9389c081cdd72d2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2046662382", "DOI": "10.3390/W4040759", "CorpusId": 155059510}, "title": "The CO2 Emission Factor of Water in Japan", "abstract": "From the viewpoint of combating global warming in Japan, measures to reduce emissions from the activities involved in daily life have been accelerated in concurrence with the efforts made in the industrial sector to save energy. As one such measure, the reduction of energy consumption in waterworks and sewer systems by reducing the volume of water used in the housing sector is gaining attention; measures for the conversion of water saving into CO2 reduction credit in the domestic credit system are also being examined. To address the credit development for CO2 reduction by water saving, it was necessary to determine the CO2 emission factor for water. Hence, we calculated the CO2 emission factor of water use in Japan and determined the value to be 0.376 kg CO2/m3 which applied the generating end electricity value. In addition, since electricity contributes to 90% of the energy consumption of the waterworks and sewer systems of Japan and since the emission factor for electricity changes with the power source composition ratio, the CO2 emission factor for water also needs to be updated to match the emission factor for electricity. We therefore developed a calculation equation for updating this emission factor.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "2ba51e033521e27f13247612ea215b410096478a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2318584283", "DOI": "10.1021/EF201021A", "CorpusId": 101334520}, "title": "Analysis of the Impact of 2-Methylfuran on Mixture Formation and Combustion in a Direct-Injection Spark-Ignition Engine", "abstract": "Within the Cluster of Excellence \u201cTailor-Made Fuels from Biomass\u201d, a new reaction sequence to transform biomass into 2-methylfuran has been developed. In the present study, the influence of this potential biofuel on in-cylinder spray formation and evaporation as well as engine performance is studied experimentally using a direct-injection spark-ignition single-cylinder research engine. The results obtained for 2-methylfuran are benchmarked against investigation on the same engine using conventional research octane number (RON) 95 fuel and ethanol. The in-cylinder spray formation and evaporation process is characterized by high-speed Mie scattering visualizations, indicating quicker evaporation of 2-methylfuran compared to ethanol. Engine experiments support the findings of the optical measurements by revealing excellent combustion stability, especially in cold conditions, combined with a hydrocarbon emission reduction of at least 61 % in the relevant spark timing range compared to conventional fuel.

Diesel and CSO oil fuel blends (10%, 30%, 50%, and 70%) were used to conduct engine performance and smoke emission tests at varying loads of 0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% of full load in addition to their straight CSO and diesel fuel. The performance parameters of brake specific energy consumption (BSFC), brake thermal efficiency (BTE), mechanical efficiency (ME), exhaust gas temperature (EGT), and exhaust emission (smoke) were evaluated to find the optimum CSO and diesel fuel blend. From the experimental results, the CSO10D90 blend fuel showed 3.7% reduction in BSFC, 1.7% increase in BTE, 6.7% increase in ME, and 21.7% reduction in the smoke emissions in comparison with conventional diesel operated engine.
