Trends in the composition of the lower atmosphere (0\u20131500 m altitude) and surface air quality over the Baltimore/Washington area and surrounding states were investigated for the period from 1997 to 2011. We examined emissions of ozone precursors from monitors and inventories as well as ambient ground-level and aircraft measurements to characterize trends in air pollution. The US EPA Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) program reported substantial decreases in emission of summertime nitrogen oxides (NOx) from power plants, up to \u223c80% in the mid-Atlantic States. These large reductions in emission of NOx are reflected in a sharp decrease of ground-level concentrations of NOx starting around 2003. The decreasing trend of tropospheric column CO observed by aircraft is \u223c0.8 Dobson unit (DU) per year, corresponding to \u223c35 ppbv yr\u22121 in the lower troposphere (the surface to 1500 m above ground level). Satellite observations of long-term, near-surface CO show a \u223c40% decrease over western Maryland between 2000 and 2011; the same magnitude is indicated by aircraft measurements above these regions upwind of the Baltimore/Washington airshed. With decreasing emissions of ozone precursors, the ground-level ozone in the Baltimore/Washington area shows a 0.6 ppbv yr\u22121 decrease in the past 15 yr. Since photochemical production of ozone is substantially influenced by ambient temperature, we introduce the climate penalty factor (CPF) into the trend analysis of long-term aircraft measurements. After compensating for inter-annual variations in temperature, historical aircraft measurements indicate that the daily net production of tropospheric ozone over the Baltimore/Washington area decreased from \u223c20 ppbv day\u22121 in the late 1990s to \u223c7 ppbv day\u22121 in the early 2010s during ozone season. A decrease in the long-term column ozone is observed as \u223c0.2 DU yr\u22121 in the lowest 1500 m, corresponding to an improvement of \u223c1.3 ppbv yr\u22121. Our aircraft measurements were conducted on days when severe ozone pollution was forecasted, and these results represent the decreasing trend in high ozone events over the past 15 yr. Back trajectory cluster analysis demonstrates that emissions of air pollutants from Ohio and Pennsylvania through Maryland influence the column abundances of downwind ozone in the lower atmosphere. The trends in air pollutants reveal the success of regulations implemented over the past decades and the importance of region-wide emission controls in the eastern United States.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "1684558c151e17e27b39a00220030aa2398a18c3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1496706760", "DOI": "10.1007/978-94-009-6143-2", "CorpusId": 6808766}, "title": "Protochlorophyllide Reduction and Greening", "abstract": "Preface.- Section 1: Protochlorophyllide Photooxidoreductase Properties and Localisation.- A critical appraisal of the role and regulation of NADPH-protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase in greening plants.- Changes in the properties of protochlorophyllide reductase during early greening of etiolated squash cotyledons.- Proteolytic effects on the protochlorophyllide-oxidoreductase in oat.- Characterization of PChlide-protein complexes in PT and PLB enriched fractions of bean etioplasts.

The Tommeliten seepage area is part of the Greater Ekofisk area, which is situated above the Tommeliten Delta salt diapir in the central North Sea (56\u00b029.90' N, 2\u00b059.80' E, Norwegian Block 1/9, 75 m water depth). Here, cracks in a buried marl horizon allow methane to migrate into overlying clay-silt and sandy sediments. Hydroacoustic sediment echosounding showed several venting spots coinciding with the apex of marl domes where methane is released into the water column and potentially to the atmosphere. In the vicinity of the gas seeps, sea floor observations showed small mats of giant sulphide-oxidizing bacteria above patches of black sediments as well as carbonate crusts, which are exposed 10 to 50 cm above seafloor forming small reefs. These Methane-Derived Authigenic Carbonates (MDACs) contain 13C-depleted, archaeal lipids indicating previous gas seepage and AOM activity. High amounts of sn2-hydroxyarchaeol relative to archaeol and low abundances of biphytanes in the crusts give evidence that ANaerobic MEthane-oxidising archaea (ANME) of the phylogenetic cluster ANME-2 were the potential mediators of Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane (AOM) at the time of carbonate formation. Small pieces of MDACs were also found subsurface at about 1.7 m sediment depth, associated with the AOM zone. This zone is characterized by elevated AOM and Sulphate Reduction (SR) rates, increased concentrations of 13C-depleted tetraether derived biphytanes, and specific bacterial Fatty Acids (FA). Further biomarker and 16S rDNA based analyses of this horizon give evidence that AOM is mediated by archaea belonging to the ANME-1b group and Sulphate Reducing Bacteria (SRB) most likely belonging to the Seep-SRB1 cluster. The zone of active methane consumption was restricted to a distinct horizon of about 20 cm.

Critical loads of acidity for Finnish lakes were determined using the steady-state First-order Acidity Balance (FAB) model in conjunction with comprehensive national surveys of surface waters (headwater lakes; n = 1066) and soils.

For both diseases, under the future climate scenarios, there was a global reduction in the potentially suitable area. Among the three global climate models, this reduction ranged from 11% to 22% for Dothistroma needle blight and from 39% to 58% for pitch canker. The projected potential ranges of both diseases were significantly reduced for Africa, South America, and Australia. In Asia and North America, substantial reductions in potential area were generally projected for pitch canker, while little change to moderate levels of expansion were projected for Dothistroma needle blight.

One way the country plans to meet this target is by reducing its emissions from deforestation and forest degradation through the REDD+ mechanism. By implementing REDD+, Indonesia will become eligible to receive financial payments based on forest carbon credits. A substantial amount of Indonesia's carbon emissions are caused by deforestation and forest degradation from land conversion activities, forest fires and illegal logging, with the latter having significant impacts as a driver of deforestation. Therefore, initiatives to curb illegal logging will have to form a central part of any emission reduction strategy. REDD+ has the potential to help reduce illegal logging activities by creating financial incentives to encourage compliance with the law, changes in behaviour and wider governance reforms. Since 2001, several initiatives in Indonesia have attempted to address the problem of illegal logging. These include international initiatives such as the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process; bilateral agreements between Indonesia and major importers of timber; and market instruments such as timber certification. National initiatives include joint security sweeps to combat illegal logging, anti-money laundering approaches to tackle illegal finance in the sector and the expansion of timber plantations to increase the supply of timber.

Heat stress was applied by either heating leaves through temperature response curve measurements from 20 to 40\u2009\u00b0C (mild stress), exposing plants for 4\u2009h to temperatures 25-44\u2009\u00b0C (long-term stress) or shock-heating leaves to 45-50\u2009\u00b0C. Photosynthetic reduction through temperature response curves was associated with decreased stomatal conductance, while the reduction due to long-term stress and collapse of photosynthetic activity after heat shock stress were associated with non-stomatal processes. Mild stress decreased constitutive monoterpene emissions, while long-term stress and shock stress resulted in emissions of the lipoxygenase pathway and glucosinolate volatiles.

Results from the different landfill gas (LFG) quantification approaches ranged from an emissions source of 557 kt carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) (FCM-PCP) to a carbon sink of\u2009\u221253 kt CO2e (EPA WARM). Similar values were obtained between IPCC approaches. The IPCC 2006 method was found to be more appropriate for inventorying applications because it uses a waste-in-place (WIP) approach, rather than a methane commitment (MC) approach, despite perceived onerous data requirements for WIP. MC approaches were found to be useful from a planning standpoint; however, uncertainty associated with their projections of future parameter values limits their applicability for GHG inventorying. MC and WIP methods provided similar results in this case study; however, this is case specific because of similarity in assumptions of present and future landfill parameters and quantities of annual waste deposited in recent years being relatively consistent. IMPLICATIONS This paper provides insight for municipalities, consultants, and others involved in GHG quantification from waste management with regard to emissions from various treatment options and variation due to methodological selection. By examining the differences in emissions from the quantification tools and guidelines examined in this research, these professionals will gain insight on where shortcomings and methodological differences exist and how these may be addressed. It also provides an illustration of how theoretical yield gas calculations can be similar in magnitude to those calculated using a WIP approach.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "ef0b4449e1ddb4fc0155e93998160ef82ceeea1e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1156688979", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ECONMOD.2015.08.001", "CorpusId": 17054871}, "title": "Emission reduction policy: A regional economic analysis for China", "abstract": null, "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "190a97f1e5444658003c4783554dee366955aa75", "externalIds": {"MAG": "622839197", "CorpusId": 136899113}, "title": "Evaluation of Evotherm\u00ae for use in Warm Mix Asphalt", "abstract": "Several new processes have been developed with the goal of reducing the mixing and compaction temperatures of hot mix asphalt without sacrificing the quality of the resulting pavement. One of these processes utilizes Evotherm\u00ae, an asphalt emulsion produced by MeadWestvaco\u2019s Asphalt Innovations division. A laboratory study was conducted to determine the applicability of Evotherm\u00ae to typical paving operations and environmental conditions commonly found in the United States, including the performance of the mixes in quick traffic turn-over situations and high temperature conditions. Superpave gyratory compactor (SGC) results indicated that Evotherm\u00ae may lower the optimum asphalt content; however, it is currently recommended to determine the optimum asphalt content with a typical PG graded binder, and then substitute the Evotherm\u00ae emulsion. Evotherm\u00ae was shown to improve the compactability of mixtures in both the SGC and vibratory compactor. Statistics indicated an overall reduction in air voids. Improved compaction was noted at temperatures as low as 190\u00b0F (88\u00b0C). The addition of Evotherm\u00ae does not statistically affect the resilient modulus of an asphalt mix nor does it increase the rutting potential of an asphalt mix as measured by the Asphalt Pavement Analyzer. The rutting potential did increase with decreasing mixing and compaction temperatures, which may be related to the decreased aging of the binder resulting from the lower mixing and compaction temperatures. There was no evidence of a difference in indirect tensile strength gain with time for the mixes containing Evotherm\u00ae as compared to the control mixes, indicating that a Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA) containing Evotherm\u00ae can be quickly opened to traffic. The lower compaction temperature used when producing Warm Mix Asphalt with Evotherm\u00ae or any WMA additive may increase the potential for moisture damage. Overall, Evotherm\u00ae appears to be a viable tool for reducing mixing and compaction temperatures that can be readily added to hot mix asphalt. Reductions in mixing and compaction temperatures are expected to reduce fuel costs, reduce emissions, and widen the winter paving window.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "dea6dd7ab39fb66c8018294ed41cc67b6d1ac9af", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2024479910", "ArXiv": "1001.0422", "DOI": "10.1103/PhysRevB.82.075429", "CorpusId": 119207189}, "title": "Plasmon-mediated superradiance near metal nanostructures", "abstract": "We develop a theory of cooperative emission of light by an ensemble of emitters, such as fluorescing molecules or semiconductor quantum dots, located near a metal nanostructure supporting surface plasmon.

Specifically, when emitters are removed by more than several nm from the metal surface, the emission is dominated by three superradiant states with the same quantum yield as a single emitter, resulting in a drastic reduction of ensemble radiated energy, while at smaller distances cooperative behavior is destroyed by nonradiative transitions.

China will probably surpass the United States as the largest carbon emitter early in the next century. The global warming treaty signed in Rio in 1992 relies entirely on voluntary emission caps for developed countries and has had little or no apparent effect on emissions.

We use a set of three global integrated assessment models to analyze the implications of current climate policies on long-term mitigation targets. We define a weak-policy baseline scenario, which extrapolates the current policy environment by assuming that the global climate regime remains fragmented and that emission reduction efforts remain unambitious in most of the world\u2019s regions. These scenarios clearly fall short of limiting warming to 2\u00a0\u00b0C. We investigate the cost and achievability of the stabilization of atmospheric GHG concentrations at 450\u00a0ppm CO2e by 2100, if countries follow the weak policy pathway until 2020 or 2030 before pursuing the long-term mitigation target with global cooperative action. We find that after a deferral of ambitious action the 450\u00a0ppm CO2e is only achievable with a radical up-scaling of efforts after target adoption. This has severe effects on transformation pathways and exacerbates the challenges of climate stabilization, in particular for a delay of cooperative action until 2030. Specifically, reaching the target with weak near-term action implies (a) faster and more aggressive transformations of energy systems in the medium term, (b) more stranded investments in fossil-based capacities, (c) higher long-term mitigation costs and carbon prices and (d) stronger transitional economic impacts, rendering the political feasibility of such pathways questionable.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "078de866bc9c9a4e3eaadc5f87820fc8bbed47d8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2118740272", "DOI": "10.3141/1641-06", "CorpusId": 26821631}, "title": "Modeling Enleanment Emissions for Light-Duty Vehicles", "abstract": "A comprehensive modal emissions model for light-duty cars and trucks is being developed under the sponsorship of NCHRP Project 25-11.

A modal emissions model is presented for vehicles operated under enleanment conditions. Enleanment typically occurs with sharp deceleration or load reduction events, and sometimes during long deceleration. Under enleanment conditions, the air/fuel ratio is lean and incomplete combustion or misfire occurs. Preliminary research indicates that enleanment emissions (particularly for hydrocarbons) contribute significantly to a vehicle\u2019s overall emissions. An enleanment emissions module has been developed on the basis of second-by-second emission measurements generated at the College of Engineering\u2014Center for Environmental Research and Technology\u2019s vehicle testing facility using the Federal Test Procedure, US06, and a specially designed modal emission cycle (MEC01). On the basis of more than 200 vehicles tested and modeled, lean-burn hydrocarbon emissions (HClean) account for 10 to 20 percent of the overall HC emissions under the various test cycles. HClean emission contributions vary greatly from vehicle to vehicle, ranging from near 0 to more than 30 percent of total HC emissions of individual vehicles. After detailed analysis of the second-by-second emission data over the modal emission cycle MECO1, it was found that enleanment hydrocarbons emissions are mostly associated with rapid load reduction events and long deceleration events. The former is most likely to cause extremely high levels of HC as short spikes, and the latter is mostly associated with longer-lasting HC puffs. A methodology has been developed to characterize and model enleanment hydrocarbons emissions associated with these two events.

The design and performance of such systems have been commercially proven to the point that the application of these technologies is a cost effective means for states to effectively meet pollution reduction goals. One of the reasons that these technologies are so widely applied is because they can be sized and fitted based on easily measurable vehicle parameters and published engine emission information. These devices generally work passively with basic temperature and back pressure monitoring devices being used to alert the operator to upset conditions. The application of an effective NOx reduction technology in similar retrofit installation, is more complicated. There are no passive NOx reduction technologies that can be retrofit onto HDD vehicles. Because of the long useful life of existing HDD vehicles, a retrofit SCR technology that could provide 80% NOx reduction will be very beneficial. Previously, a retrofit CRDPF plus SCR technology was demonstrated for NOx reductions of 80% [1]. However, this system was primarily designed for development and demonstration purposes and there is a need for a truly commercialized retrofit product. In order to be widely acceptable, a retrofit SCR technology needs to be flexible in its control and installation, allowing it to fit on to a large cross section of vehicles. It must also be durable and cost effective. This paper will discuss the development of a commercially available four-way (NOx, PM, CO and HC) emission reduction product for retrofit on HDD vehicles. The system combines the Johnson Matthey CRT \u00ae filter with a urea SCR system and is known commercially as SCRT\u00ae system. This paper will discuss the development of such a system through integration of the injection system hardware, control algorithm and catalysts. The SCRT\u00ae system utilizes a urea injection system that is deployed on the vehicle as components giving the product more flexibility and lower cost. The urea injection components are: urea pump, air regulator, dosing unit and nozzle. The system utilizes a control system that allows the application engineer to customize it to the engine and catalyst size. It can also use either an engine map or NOx sensor for urea injection control. Transient and steady state test cell data demonstrating > 80% NOx reduction with this system are presented.

Reducing black carbon (BC) emissions has been recognized as an\nefficient way to simultaneously improve air quality and mitigate climate\nchange. However, the benefits of BC emission controls are not well\nquantified,\npartly due to a lack of understanding of the changes in BC light absorption\nas a result of emission reductions. In this work, we discuss the effects of\nmulti-pollutant emission reductions on BC light absorption based on a\nfield campaign study conducted before, during and after the 2014 APEC\n(Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation) meeting in Beijing, China. When emission\nrestrictions were in place during APEC, we found that the reduction in the\nlight absorption of BC-containing particles was driven by both the decrease\nin BC mass concentration and the weakened light-absorption capability of BC.\nCompared with that before and after APEC, the daytime light absorption of\nBC-containing particles during APEC was reduced by \u223c56\u2009%, of which\n\u223c48% was contributed by the decrease in BC mass concentration and the\nremaining \u223c8\u2009% was contributed by a weakening of light-absorption\ncapability for BC.

Variability in CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions from soils was to the greatest extent influenced by soil temperature, but soil moisture, mineral\u2010N and pH were also important. The increased N2O emissions from cleared woodland on clay soil were attributed to increased mineralization and N availability when no tree could take up that N, while the N mineralized on the sandy soil could have been largely leached due to the soil's poor nutrient holding capacity, resulting in a relatively lower N2O emission response to clearing. We concluded that the alteration of woodlands by deforestation and cultivation increased soil temperature, resulting in increased soil respiration, while the establishment of Eucalyptus plantations may provide an option for reduction in soil emissions of CO2 and N2O and a sink for CH4.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "0b4c6c8f131d93f38ab729f6a549475aea3643e7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2262611497", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-009-9653-8", "CorpusId": 34913240}, "title": "Coupling biophysical and micro-economic models to assess the effect of mitigation measures on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture", "abstract": "Agricultural soils are a major source of atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas (GHG).

Here, we coupled a biophysical soil-crop model, CERES-EGC, with an economic farm type supply model, AROPAj, at the regional scale in northern France. Response curves of N2O emissions to fertilizer nitrogen (Nf) inputs were generated with CERES-EGC, and linearized to obtain emission factors.

This resulted in a N2O efflux 20% lower than with the default IPCC method. The costs of abating GHG emissions from agriculture were calculated using a first-best tax on GHG emissions, and a second-best tax on their presumed factors (livestock size and fertilizer inputs).

Many taxis and public buses are powered by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in Hong Kong. With more vehicles using LPG, they have become the major contributor to ambient volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in Hong Kong. An intervention program which aimed to reduce the emissions of VOCs and nitrogen oxides (NOx) from LPG-fueled vehicles was implemented by the Hong Kong government in September 2013. Long-term real-time measurements indicated that the program was remarkably effective in reducing LPG-related VOCs, NOx and nitric oxide (NO) in the atmosphere. Receptor modeling results further revealed that propane, propene, i-butane, n-butane and NO in LPG-fueled vehicle exhaust emissions decreased by 40.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1, 45.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.2, 35.7\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1, 47.8\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.1 and 88.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.7\u202f%, respectively, during the implementation of the program.

We estimate that every 10 cm of reduction in WTDe could reduce the net warming impact of CO2 and CH4 emissions (100-year Global Warming Potentials) by at least 3 t CO2e ha-1 yr-1, until WTDe is < 30 cm. Raising water levels further would continue to have a net cooling effect until WTDe is < 10 cm.

Nine key CH4 mitigation measures are proposed for the CH4 mitigation assessment from landfills. Approximately 0.66 million metric tons (Mt) of CH4 and 1.14 Mt of CH4 will be released, respectively, from new and existing landfills under a 2030 business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, which is 23.5% lower than a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimation.

Soil moisture and nitrogen (N) are among the major factors limiting grassland productivity. In pastures, N fertilizer returns by grazing animals are spatially and temporally heterogenous, and we therefore hypothesized that responses of plants and soil processes to drought may differ at the patch level.MethodsUsing rain-exclusion roofs, we simulated severe summer drought in a three-year field experiment replicated at two grassland sites contrasting in climate and management intensity. The study included a factorial N application treatment encompassing the application of cattle urine and mineral nitrogen. Responses of plants, soil microbes, and soil organic matter were assessed (carbon and nitrogen pools). N2O emissions were measured on 72 dates, and soil N2O concentration profiles on 44 dates.ResultsPlant productivity responded negatively to drought and positively to N application. Interestingly, no or only small drought-effect were found on plant productivity when cumulated over the entire experimental duration, despite large effects during and shortly after the period when rain-exclusion roofs were installed. We further did not find evidence for compensatory growth after drought, and drought-effects did not differ between fertilizer hot spots and unaffected areas. In the short-term, soil microbial biomass responded positively to drought, but no long-term effects were detected. Nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions originated primarily from fertilizer hot spots, and these emissions were massively reduced under drought, with effects lasting throughout most of the growing season. On a growing season basis, N2O emissions were estimated to be 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower under drought.ConclusionsOverall, our data suggest that even severe summer drought may have relatively little effect on plant productivity in the type of grassland and climate investigated, at least when considered on an annual basis.

Contrary to most regions in the US, ozone in the northern Front Range metropolitan area (NFRMA) of Colorado was either stagnant or increasing between 2000 and 2015, despite substantial reductions in NOx emissions. We used available long-term ozone and NOx data in the NFRMA to investigate these trends. Ozone increased from weekdays to weekends for a number of sites in the NFRMA with weekend reductions in NO2 at two sites in downtown Denver, indicating that the region was in a NOx-saturated ozone production regime. The stagnation and increases in ozone in the NFRMA are likely due to a combination of decreasing NOx emissions in a NOx-saturated environment and increased anthropogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions in the NFRMA. Further investigation of the weekend\u2013weekday effect showed that the region outside of the most heavily trafficked Denver area was transitioning to peak ozone production towards NOx-limited chemistry. This transition implies that continued NOx decreases will result in ozone being less sensitive to changes in either anthropogenic or biogenic VOC reactivity in the NFRMA. In contrast to anthropogenic VOCs, biogenic VOCs are unlikely to have increased in the NFRMA between 2000 and 2015, but are temperature dependent and likely vary by drought year. Ozone in the NFRMA has a temperature dependence, albeit smaller than many other US locations, consistent with biogenic VOC contributions to ozone production in the region. We show that while ozone increased with temperature in the NFRMA, which is consistent with a NOx-saturated regime coupled to temperature-dependent VOCs, this relationship is suppressed in drought years. We attribute this drought year suppression to decreased biogenic isoprene emissions due to long-term drought stress. Thus, while anthropogenic NOx and VOCs likely dominate ozone production regimes in the NFRMA, biogenic VOCs may also impact regional ozone and its temperature dependence.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "25e928f7d5ffb9965a23dd8a4d00e15a7f7e9284", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2265415365", "DOI": "10.4271/2003-01-0778", "CorpusId": 112029421}, "title": "The Development and Performance of the Compact SCR-Trap System: A 4-Way Diesel Emission Control System", "abstract": "The tightening of Heavy Duty Diesel (HDD) emissions legislation throughout the world is leading to the development of emission control devices to enable HDD engines to meet the new standards.

One policy, Senate Bill (SB) 375, gained widespread attention as \u201cthe nation's first law to combat greenhouse gas emissions by reducing sprawl\u201d (Office of the Governor of California, 2008). What does experience to date indicate about the effectiveness of California's institutional model for achieving GHG reductions from transportation and land use? Purpose: SB 375, adopted in 2008, requires California's urban regions to achieve mandated GHG reductions through coordinated transportation and land use. After its passage, the California Air Resources Board moderated a lively, contentious negotiation process with the state's 18 Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) to define potential GHG reductions and assign the mandated targets. We evaluate progress toward achieving SB 375 goals, analyzing the target-setting process and local government engagement. We assess the viability of California's largely voluntary model for achieving climate goals through smart growth. Methods: We consider the two-year-long SB 375 target-setting process as an exercise in institution building, creating new planning requirements that build on existing regional processes but also require the development of new techniques for systematically evaluating policy options and assigning regional responsibility. We evaluate MPO data on the potential of various smart growth policy options for reducing GHGs, and consider the activities and perspective of local planners by incorporating findings from surveys and interviews. Results and conclusions: SB 375 demonstrates that regional smart growth climate policy can be built on existing planning processes, particularly for transportation and associated air quality requirements. However, regional and local planners express concerns about inadequate resources for implementation. Without strong state or federal mandates or incentives that favor the policy outcomes envisioned in SB 375, the law expects more from MPOs than they can easily accomplish. As executed so far, SB 375 adds only a modest contribution to state efforts to reduce GHGs by 2020. At the local level, we document a sharp rise in climate policymaking, but also gaps between regional and local assessment and mitigation strategies. Takeaway for practice: It is possible to systematize collaborative climate goal setting for development planning across regions, but negotiating fair share responsibilities is inherently political and requires strong institutions in order to succeed. Effective smart growth climate planning requires matching responsibility and authority with incentives that integrate state, regional, and local needs and responsibilities; tough performance mandates and/or strong incentives are needed to bridge the traditional regional\u2013local divide. To reinforce climate policy through local environmental review, requirements must be linked to regional plans; otherwise, project-by-project mitigation may work at cross-purposes with wider strategies.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "04165152c353fd9db9041d8f06206590d220ed14", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2187959098", "CorpusId": 110317596}, "title": "Real-World Duty Cycles and Utilization for Construction Equipment in North Carolina", "abstract": "Field data for in-use fuel consumption and emission rates were collected for 15 nonroad vehicles using a portable emission measurement system (PEMS).

Typical duty cycles were quantified in terms of frequency distributions of manifold absolute pressure (MAP) and used to estimate cycle average emission factors. On average, the use of B20 instead of petroleum diesel lead to an insignificant 1.8% decrease in NO emission rate and significant decreases of 18, 26, and 25% for opacity, HC, and CO, respectively. Emission rates were also found to decrease significantly when comparing newer, higher tier vehicles to lower ones. Fuel use rate, and NO, HC, and CO emission factors, were found to be of similar magnitude as independent benchmark data. An emissions inventory was developed for these vehicles. The current fuel mix of B20 and petroleum diesel is estimated to produce 0.4 to 6.4 percent lower emissions, depending on the pollutant, than usage of 100 percent petroleum diesel. If NCDOT were to use 100% B20 in the same vehicles, then additional reductions in emissions of each pollutant would be approximately 2.0% to 36.9% lower than for the current fuel mix of B20 and petroleum diesel. Although higher tier engines have lower emissions factors for each pollutant than lower tier engines, their annual average emissions tend to be higher because of greater utilization. Specific recommendations are made for future work, including expansion of the use of B20 to further reduce tailpipe emissions in the NCDOT inventory, replacement of older vehicles with newer ones, field data for larger sample sizes of vehicles for each Tier in order to improve confidence in the emissions factors and inventories, assessment of Tier 4 vehicles as they become available using improved instrumentation, evaluation of fuel formulations, evaluations of other vehicle types, and others.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "aa758c60ac46e4cee41c2d61577ec033c76ce3d1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2067313140", "DOI": "10.1080/19373260.2010.492588", "CorpusId": 110565004}, "title": "Characteristics of ultra-high performance \u2018ductile\u2019 concrete and its impact on sustainable construction", "abstract": "This article presents an overview of the material characteristics of a Malaysia blend of ultra-high performance \u2018ductile\u2019 concrete (UHPdC).

In this study we simulated the deposition of soot aerosol on snow and the resulting impact on snowpack and the hydrological cycle in the western United States. A year-long simulation was performed using the chemistry version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-Chem) to determine the soot deposition, followed by three simulations using WRF in meteorology-only mode, with and without the soot-induced snow albedo perturbations. The chemistry simulation shows large spatial variability in soot deposition that reflects the localized emissions and the influence of the complex terrain. The soot-induced snow albedo perturbations increase the surface net solar radiation flux during late winter to early spring, increase the surface air temperature, and reduce the snow accumulation and spring snowmelt. These effects are stronger over the central Rockies and southern Alberta, where soot deposition and snowpack overlap the most. The indirect forcing of soot accelerates snowmelt and alters stream flows, including a trend toward earlier melt dates in the western United States. The soot-induced albedo reduction initiates a positive feedback process whereby dirty snow absorbs more solar radiation, heating the surface and warming the air. This warming causes reduced snow depth and fraction, which further reduces the regional surface albedo for the snow-covered regions.

The aims of the present study are: (1) to compare the environmental performance of organic farming dairy systems with the currently prevalent animal housing systems [solid farmyard manure (FYM) versus liquid slurry] as the main reference systems; (2) to analyze the effect of the implementation of a biogas digestion system on the consumption of fossil fuels and production of electrical energy; (3) to quantify the effects of the implementation of a biogas digestion system on the environment; and (4) to compare the obtained net energy yields with other means of obtaining energy by using the farmland area. The considered impact categories are greenhouse gas (GHG) balances, acidification, eutrophication and groundwater pollution. LCA results indicated that total emissions in systems based on FYM are much higher than in liquid slurry systems for most of the considered impact categories. The benefits of digestion of stable wastes in comparison with the reference system without digestion are mainly (1) the net reduction of the emissions of GHG and (2) energy recovery from produced biogas, while the disadvantages can be higher emissions of NH3 after spreading. The effects of additional biogas digestion of biomass such as crop residues (e.g., straw of peas and cereals) and cover crops are: (1) an optimization of the N-cycle and therewith higher yields; (2) higher energy production per unit arable land; (3) a further reduction of the GHG balance; but (4) higher N-related environmental burdens like eutrophication and acidification. The offsets of fossil fuel emissions were the largest GHG sink in most of the biogas digestion systems. The inclusion of a biogas plant into organic cropping systems and the use of the available wastes for production of energy largely increased the overall productivity of the farming system and matched very well the basic principles of organic farming such as a high self-sufficiency of the cropping system and reducing as much as possible the environmental impact of farming.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "dadd00154ddbeb788ae8c6c86a3423010929d544", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2620199202", "CorpusId": 134221799}, "title": "Analysing the Emission Gap Between Pledged Emission Reductions Under the Cancun Agreements and the 2 Degree-C Climate Target", "abstract": "Since the climate negotiations in Copenhagen (2009), many countries have pledged to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by 2020.

An analytical tool is needed for optimizing criteria pollutant reductions given the budgetary constraints. The simplest approach is to take costs and pollutant removals to be linear with each strategy's scale of activity, and this is readily solved as a linear programming problem. Another approach is to use a dynamic system of weights which shift with progressive improvements in pollutant emissions. The two approaches yield somewhat different results, suggesting the sensitivity of the solution to the assumed weights. The study also illustrates the importance of a sound methodology for evaluating priorities given to different air quality goals. One such methodology may involve a polling of expert panels and the public to gain insight into the relative importance given to competing emissions reduction goals. An informal polling of resource agency staff was conducted and discussed in this paper.

The green granules formed from the sinter mixture containing charcoal were clearly less dense and formed a less compacted green bed as evidenced by the packing density. To achieve return fines balance, fuel addition had to be increased from 3.62 to 4.17% (on a dry mixture basis) as the substitution of charcoal increased from 0 to 50%. However, at 100% subsitution, the sinter mixture failed to achieve balance even at a very high fuel addition level of 4.7%. Compared with the sinter fired with coke breeze, the sinter from the mixtures containing up to 50% charcoal was marginally weaker in terms of sinter yield, tumble strength (TI) and reduction disintegration (RDI). The reasons for weaker sinter are discussed. Fuel rate increased considerably with charcoal substitution due to increased fuel addition and decreased sinter yield. However, increasing fuel rate did not lead to a reduction of sintering productivity. In contrast, the sintering speed and productivity were maintained as the charcoal substitution rate increased from 0 to 25% and then increased considerably with further increase in charcoal substitution rate.

Unfortunately it suffers from rather high particulate and NO x emissions that are directly related to its combustion mechanism. Future emission legislation requires drastic reduction of NO x and particulate matter compared to present values. Engine manufacturers in their effort to meet these limits propose two solutions: reduction of pollutants inside the combustion chamber using internal measures and reduction at the tailpipe using aftertreatment technology. Currently there are various opinions considering the final solution. Taking into account information related to aftertreatment technology, an effort should be made to reduce pollutants inside the combustion chamber as much as possible. The last is obvious if we account for the even more strict emission limits to be applied after 2010 that will require a combination of aftertreatment and internal measures. For this purpose it is examined in the present using a simulation tool the possibility for achieving EURO-V emission limits using conventional Dl diesel engine combustion technology and internal measures only. Towards this aim, the advancement of fuel injection timing and the increase of injection pressure in conjunction with the increase of EGR rate and boost air pressure are considered. These technologies are evaluated comparing performance and emission data against experimental ones referring to the baseline operation of a single cylinder HD Dl diesel test engine. The results are used to examine the potential for meeting EURO-V emission limits using the previous combination of internal measures. The idea is to control soot using internal measures only and use A/T devices to control NO x emissions where necessary. From the results obtained, indication is also provided for the required efficiency of after-treatment systems to fulfill future emission limits. Thus one can decide to use internal measures to control emissions up to a certain point and/or less demanding aftertreatment systems to further fulfill his requirements.

However, there are certain limitations with both technologies due to their inherent technical characteristics. Both technologies get 75-90% reduction of HC and CO. A typical oxidation catalyst can be applied to almost any heavy duty diesel application and achieve 20 to 30% reduction in PM mass but no significant reduction in the number of PM particles. On the other hand, diesel particulate filters are very effective at removing >90% of the particles by mass and >99% by number. Unfortunately, passive DPF technology cannot be applied to all applications since the filter regeneration is limited by engine out NOx to PM ratio as well as exhaust temperature. For this reason, particulate filters can not universally be applied to older \u201cdirtier\u201d engines with high PM emissions. This creates a technology gap for a passive device that can be successfully applied to old, high PM emission engines to achieve significant reduction in both PM mass and PM number. This paper will discuss the development of a passive PM control device referred to as a partial filter technology or PFT. This device combines an oxidation catalyst with a unique filter technology that can reduce PM by up to 77%. The new filter material combines the attributes of a flow through substrate with those of a wall flow filter to collect some but not necessarily all the engine out soot and thus provide PM reduction without leading to filter plugging. Due to the flow through characteristics, excess soot beyond filter capacity is not collected in the PFT and thus the exhaust is able to continue to flow without a significant increase in back pressure. The PFT system also utilizes the NO2:C reaction used by passive diesel particulate filter systems to oxidize a portion of the soot and passively regenerate the filter. In addition, the filter does not accumulate significant amounts of lube oil ash and this may minimize the need for a periodic ash cleaning maintenance. Engine bench emission testing with this system has shown PM reductions ranging from 77% for fresh (degreened) system to 63% for an aged system along with >90% HC and CO reductions. On-road operational data collected on various model year applications over a two year period has shown stable back pressure since installation. In addition, no adverse operational or maintenance issues were noted which can be attributed to the installation of the PFT system.

Among the most abundant nosZ genes found in the environment are nosZ genes affiliated with the understudied Gemmatimonadetes phylum. In this study, a unique regulatory mechanism of N2O reduction in Gemmatimonas aurantiaca strain T-27, an isolate affiliated with the Gemmatimonadetes phylum, was examined. Strain T-27 was incubated with N2O and/or O2 as the electron acceptor. Significant N2O reduction was observed only when O2 was initially present. When batch cultures of strain T-27 were amended with O2 and N2O, N2O reduction commenced after O2 was depleted. In a long-term incubation with the addition of N2O upon depletion, the N2O reduction rate decreased over time and came to an eventual stop. Spiking of the culture with O2 resulted in the resuscitation of N2O reduction activity, supporting the hypothesis that N2O reduction by strain T-27 required the transient presence of O2. The highest level of nosZ transcription (8.97 nosZ transcripts/recA transcript) was observed immediately after O2 depletion, and transcription decreased \u223c25-fold within 85 h, supporting the observed phenotype. The observed difference between responses of strain T-27 cultures amended with and without N2O to O2 starvation suggested that N2O helped sustain the viability of strain T-27 during temporary anoxia, although N2O reduction was not coupled to growth. The findings in this study suggest that obligate aerobic microorganisms with nosZ genes may utilize N2O as a temporary surrogate for O2 to survive periodic anoxia. IMPORTANCE Emission of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas and ozone depletion agent, from the soil environment is largely determined by microbial sources and sinks. N2O reduction by organisms with N2O reductases (NosZ) is the only known biological sink of N2O at environmentally relevant concentrations (up to \u223c1,000 parts per million by volume [ppmv]). Although a large fraction of nosZ genes recovered from soil is affiliated with nosZ found in the genomes of the obligate aerobic phylum Gemmatimonadetes, N2O reduction has not yet been confirmed in any of these organisms. This study demonstrates that N2O is reduced by an obligate aerobic bacterium, Gemmatimonas aurantiaca strain T-27, and suggests a novel regulation mechanism for N2O reduction in this organism, which may also be applicable to other obligate aerobic organisms possessing nosZ genes. We expect that these findings will significantly advance the understanding of N2O dynamics in environments with frequent transitions between oxic and anoxic conditions.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "ad3d49add2e9736a24a38a9896dbca6ed466c2f1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2811349094", "DOI": "10.1111/gcbb.12534", "CorpusId": 90343953}, "title": "Mapping land use changes resulting from biofuel production and the effect of mitigation measures", "abstract": "Many of the sustainability concerns of bioenergy are related to direct or indirect land use change (LUC) resulting from bioenergy feedstock production. The environmental and socio\u2010economic impacts of LUC highly depend on the site\u2010specific biophysical and socio\u2010economic conditions. The objective of this study is to spatiotemporally assess the potential LUC dynamics resulting from an increased biofuel demand, the related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the potential effect of LUC mitigation measures. This assessment is demonstrated for LUC dynamics in Brazil towards 2030, considering an increase in the global demand for bioethanol as well as other agricultural commodities. The potential effects of three LUC mitigation measures (increased agricultural productivity, shift to second\u2010generation ethanol, and strict conservation policies) are evaluated by using a scenario approach. The novel modelling framework developed consists of the global Computable General Equilibrium model MAGNET, the spatiotemporal land use allocation model PLUC, and a GIS\u2010based carbon module. The modelling simulations illustrate where LUC as a result of an increased global ethanol demand (+26 \u00d7 109 L ethanol production in Brazil) is likely to occur. When no measures are taken, sugar cane production is projected to expand mostly at the expense of agricultural land which subsequently leads to the loss of natural vegetation (natural forest and grass and shrubland) in the Cerrado and Amazon. The related losses of above and below ground biomass and soil organic carbon result in the average emission of 26 g CO2\u2010eq/MJ bioethanol. All LUC mitigation measures show potential to reduce the loss of natural vegetation (18%\u201396%) as well as the LUC\u2010related GHG emissions (7%\u201360%). Although there are several uncertainties regarding the exact location and magnitude of LUC and related GHG emissions, this study shows that the implementation of LUC mitigation measures could have a substantial contribution to the reduction of LUC\u2010related emissions of bioethanol.

The control diet consisted of 0\u00b765 timothy hay, 0\u00b720 crushed maize and 0\u00b715 soybean meal; low- and high-tannin diets contained 0\u00b7975 and 0\u00b7950 of the control diet, respectively, mixed with 0\u00b7025 and 0\u00b7050 of a commercial compound containing tannins with mean crude protein (CP) of 147 g/kg dry matter (DM) and gross energy (GE) 19 MJ/kg DM, respectively. Total contents (DM basis) of tannins (hydrolysable and condensed) in the control, low- and high-tannin diets were 0, 2\u00b78 and 5\u00b76 g/kg DM, respectively. The tannin source contained 37 and 76 g/kg DM of condensed and hydrolysable tannins, respectively (DM basis). The DM (664 g/d) and GE intakes (19\u00b70 MJ/d) were similar among diet groups. Digestibilities of all dietary components in the high-tannin diet were lower (P < 0\u00b705) than low-tannin and control diets.
