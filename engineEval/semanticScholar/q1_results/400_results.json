To control emission levels while improving performance, durability and cost, requires major advances in combustor technology. Current emissions control approaches as applied to conventional swirl-stabilized combustors include rich- and lean-burn strategies, together with staged combustion. These approaches, even in fully developed form, may not be sufficient to satisfy the projected design requirements. Unconventional combustor configurations may become necessary. Different engine cycles other than the standard Brayton cycle may also be used for special applications in order to avoid the use of excessive combustion temperatures. The paper presents an overview of the currently utilized emissions control approaches, comparing their performances and likely potential for meeting future requirements.

We investigated two basic relationships on vegetation manipulation (grass cover reduction) plots at the Jornada Experimental Range in southern New Mexico: (1) wind erosion rates (horizontal mass flux and dust emission) versus vegetative cover, and (2) nutrient loss versus vegetative cover. The results indicate that wind erosion rates and nutrient loss by dust emission are strongly affected by plant cover; however, the importance of shrubs and grasses in reducing dust flux may not be equal. The dramatic increase of wind erosion between 75% grass cover reduction and 100% grass cover reduction suggests that sparsely distributed mesquites are relatively ineffective at reducing wind erosion and nutrient loss compared to grasses. Comparisons of nutrients between surface soils and wind blown dust indicate that aeolian transport is a major cause for the loss of soil nutrients in susceptible environments. We found that increased aeolian flux over three windy seasons (March 2004\u2013July 2006) removed up to 25% of total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) from the top 5\u00a0cm of soil, and about 60% of TOC and TN loss occurred in the first windy season (March\u2013July 2004). The balance between net loss of nutrients by aeolian processes and the addition of nutrients by biotic processes changed from negative (net loss) to positive (net accumulation) between 50% grass cover reduction and 25% grass cover reduction.

Both gases are emitted from fossil fuels and biomass burning, whereas methane (CH4) alone has large sources from wetlands, agriculture, landfills and waste water. Here we use measurements in firn (perennial snowpack) air from Greenland and Antarctica to reconstruct the atmospheric variability of ethane (C2H6) during the twentieth century. Ethane levels rose from early in the century until the 1980s, when the trend reversed, with a period of decline over the next 20\u2009years. We find that this variability was primarily driven by changes in ethane emissions from fossil fuels; these emissions peaked in the 1960s and 1970s at 14\u201316 teragrams per year (1\u2009Tg = 1012\u2009g) and dropped to 8\u201310\u2009Tg\u2009yr\u22121 by the turn of the century. The reduction in fossil-fuel sources is probably related to changes in light hydrocarbon emissions associated with petroleum production and use. The ethane-based fossil-fuel emission history is strikingly different from bottom-up estimates of methane emissions from fossil-fuel use, and implies that the fossil-fuel source of methane started to decline in the 1980s and probably caused the late twentieth century slow-down in the growth rate of atmospheric methane.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "9ab38abb892b33176060c024dd14fcfbd75a2de2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1983599870", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-11-4779-2011", "CorpusId": 53469198}, "title": "Worldwide trend of atmospheric mercury since 1995", "abstract": "Abstract. Concern about the adverse effects of mercury on human health and ecosystems has led to tightening emission controls since the mid 1980s. But the resulting mercury emissions reductions in many parts of the world are believed to be offset or even surpassed by the increasing emissions in rapidly industrializing countries. Consequently, concentrations of atmospheric mercury are expected to remain roughly constant. Here we show that the worldwide atmospheric mercury concentrations have decreased by about 20 to 38 % since 1996 as indicated by long-term monitoring at stations in the Southern and Northern Hemispheres combined with intermittent measurements of latitudinal distribution over the Atlantic Ocean. The total reduction of the atmospheric mercury burden of this magnitude within 14 years is unusually large among most atmospheric trace gases and is at odds with the current mercury emission inventories with nearly constant anthropogenic emissions over this period. This suggests a major shift in the biogeochemical cycle of mercury including oceans and soil reservoirs. Decreasing reemissions from the legacy of historical mercury emissions are the most likely explanation for this decline since the hypothesis of an accelerated oxidation rate of elemental mercury in the atmosphere is not supported by the observed trends of other trace gases. Acidification of oceans, climate change, excess nutrient input and pollution may also contribute by their impact on the biogeochemistry of ocean and soils. Consequently, models of the atmospheric mercury cycle have to include soil and ocean mercury pools and their dynamics to be able to make projections of future trends.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "7161f38f54d650db16ffccf07acc6cea1c50bb33", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2128728340", "DOI": "10.1006/JEMA.2000.0393", "CorpusId": 2020817, "PubMed": "11381773"}, "title": "Indirect carbon reduction by residential vegetation and planting strategies in Chicago, USA.", "abstract": "Concern about climate change has evoked interest in the potential for urban vegetation to help reduce the levels of atmospheric carbon. This study applied computer simulations to try to quantify the modifying effects of existing vegetation on the indirect reduction of atmospheric carbon for two residential neighborhoods in north-west Chicago. The effects of shading, evapotranspiration, and windspeed reduction were considered and were found to have decreased carbon emissions by 3.2 to 3.9% per year for building types in study block 1 where tree cover was 33%, and -0.2 to 3.8% in block 2 where tree cover was 11%. This resulted in a total annual reduction of carbon emission averaging 158.7 (+/- 12.8) kg per residence in block 1 and 18.1 (+/- 5.4) kg per residence in block 2. Windspeed reduction greatly contributed to the decrease of carbon emission. However, shading increased annual carbon emission from the combined change in heating and cooling energy use due to many trees in the wrong locations, which increase heating energy use during the winter. The increase of carbon emission from shading is somewhat specific to Chicago, due in part to the large amount of clean, nuclear-generated cooling energy and the long heating season. In Chicago, heating energy is required for about eight months from October to May and cooling energy is used for the remaining 4 months from June to September. If fossil fuels had been the primary source for cooling energy and the heating season had been shorter, the shading effects on the reduction of carbon emission would be greater. Planting of large trees close to the west wall of buildings, dense planting on the north, and avoidance of planting on the south are recommended to maximize indirect carbon reduction by residential vegetation, in Chicago and other mid and high-latitude cities with long heating seasons.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "85b5c4518de7aba48a6b503efde4c98bc13c2e53", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1992108668", "DOI": "10.1007/BF01186173", "CorpusId": 95051255}, "title": "Energy use, emissions, and air pollution reduction strategies in Asia", "abstract": "In contrast to Europe and North America, air pollution in Asia is increasing rapidly, resulting in both local air quality problems and higher acidic depositions.

A summer and a winter simulation period were used, to investigate the seasonal dependence of the PM2.5 response to 50 % reductions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx), anthropogenic volatile organic com- pounds (VOCs) and anthropogenic primary organic aerosol (POA) emissions and also to temperature increases of 2.5 and 5 K. Reduction of NH3 emissions seems to be the most effective control strategy for reducing PM2.5, in both pe- riods, resulting in a decrease of PM2.5 up to 5.1 \u00b5g m 3 and 1.8 \u00b5g m 3 (5.5 % and 4 % on average) during summer and winter respectively, mainly due to reduction of ammo- nium nitrate (NH4NO3) (20 % on average in both periods). The reduction of SO2 emissions decreases PM2.5 in both periods having a significant effect over the Balkans (up to 1.6 \u00b5g m 3 ) during the modeled summer period, mainly due to decrease of sulfate (34 % on average over the Balkans). The anthropogenic POA control strategy reduces total OA by 15 % during the modeled winter period and 8 % in the sum- mer period. The reduction of total OA is higher in urban areas close to its emissions sources. A slight decrease of OA (8 % in the modeled summer period and 4 % in the modeled win- ter period) is also predicted after a 50 % reduction of VOCs emissions due to the decrease of anthropogenic SOA. The re- duction of NOx emissions reduces PM2.5 (up to 3.4 \u00b5g m 3 ) during the summer period, due to a decrease of NH4NO3, causing although an increase of ozone concentration in ma- jor urban areas and over Western Europe. Additionally, the NOx control strategy actually increases PM2.5 levels during the winter period, due to more oxidants becoming available to react with SO2 and VOCs. The increase of temperature results in a decrease of PM2.5 in both periods over Central Europe, mainly due to a decrease of NH4NO3 during sum- mer (18 %) and fresh POA during wintertime (35 %). Signif- icant increases of OA are predicted during the summer due mainly to the increase of biogenic VOC emissions. On the contrary, OA is predicted to decrease in the modeled win- ter period due to the dominance of fresh POA reduction and the small biogenic SOA contribution to OA. The resulting in- crease of oxidant levels from the temperature rise lead to an increase of sulfate levels in both periods, mainly over North Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. The substantial reduction of PM2.5 components due to emissions reductions of their pre- cursors outlines the importance of emissions for improving air quality, while the sensitivity of PM 2.5 concentrations to temperature changes indicate that climate interactions need to be considered when predicting future levels of PM, with different net effects in different parts of Europe.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "03d061cdc4e2523ce1e389b29078b2b0479b91a1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2160646183", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-13-11375-2013", "CorpusId": 56072854}, "title": "The evolution of shipping emissions and the costs of regulation changes in the northern EU area", "abstract": "Abstract.

This includes emission legislation, fuel quality, diesel engine- and exhaust gas aftertreatment technologies, as well as particulate composition, with a focus on the mass-related particulate emission of on-road vehicle applications. Diesel engine technologies representative of real-world on-road applications will be highlighted.Internal engine modifications now make it possible to minimize particulate and nitrogen oxide emissions with nearly no reduction in power. Among these modifications are cooled exhaust gas recirculation, optimized injections systems, adapted charging systems and optimized combustion processes with high turbulence. With introduction and optimization of exhaust gas aftertreatment systems, such as the diesel oxidation catalyst and the diesel particulate trap, as well as NOx-reduction systems, pollutant emissions have been significantly decreased. Today, sulfur poisoning of diesel oxidation catalysts is no longer considered a problem due to the low-sulfur fuel used in Europe. In the future, there will be an increased use of bio-fuels, which generally have a positive impact on the particulate emissions and do not increase the particle number emissions.Since the introduction of the EU emissions legislation, all emission limits have been reduced by over 90%. Further steps can be expected in the future. Retrospectively, the particulate emissions of modern diesel engines with respect to quality and quantity cannot be compared with those of older engines. Internal engine modifications lead to a clear reduction of the particulate emissions without a negative impact on the particulate-size distribution towards smaller particles. The residual particles can be trapped in a diesel particulate trap independent of their size or the engine operating mode. The usage of a wall-flow diesel particulate filter leads to an extreme reduction of the emitted particulate mass and number, approaching 100%.

When compared to the petroleum-based fuels currently used in these vehicles, CNG and centrally produced LNG increase emissions by 0-3% and 2-13%, respectively, for Class 8 trucks.

We investigated the capability of two organic amendments, a composted manure (CM) and a biosolid-manure mix (BM), to accelerate 1,3-D degradation in soil. Degradation of 1,3-D was significantly enhanced in amended soils compared to the unamended soil, and the degree of acceleration varied with the type as well as the rate of amendment. Compost manure was more effective in stimulating 1,3-D degradation than the less decomposed BM; even at an amendment/soil ratio as low as 1:40 (w/w), degradation in the CM-amended soil was two times faster than that in the unamended soil.

A reliable and up-to-date ship emission inventory is essential for atmospheric scientists quantifying the impact of shipping and for policy makers implementing regulations and incentives for emission reduction. The emission modelling in this study takes into account ship type and size dependent input data for 15 ship types and 7 size categories. Global port arrival and departure data for more than 32 000 merchant ships are used to establish operational profiles for the ship segments. The modelled total fuel consumption amounts to 217 Mt in 2004 of which 11 Mt is consumed in in-port operations. This is in agreement with international sales statistics. The modelled fuel consumption is applied to develop global emission inventories for CO2, NO2, SO2, CO, CH4, VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds), N2O, BC (Black Carbon) and OC (Organic Carbon). The global emissions from ships at sea and in ports are distributed geographically, applying extended geographical data sets covering about 2 million global ship observations and global port data for 32 000 ships. In addition to inventories for the world fleet, inventories are produced separately for the three dominating ship types, using ship type specific emission modelling and traffic distributions. A global Chemical Transport Model (CTM) was used to calculate the environmental impacts of the emissions. We find that ship emissions is a dominant contributor over much of the world oceans to surface concentrations of NO2 and SO2. The contribution is also large over some coastal zones. For surface ozone the contribution is high over the oceans but clearly also of importance over Western North America (contribution 15\u201325%) and Western Europe (5\u201315%). The contribution to tropospheric column ozone is up to 5\u20136%. The overall impact of ship emissions on global methane lifetime is large due to the high NOx emissions. With regard to acidification we find that ships contribute 11% to nitrate wet deposition and 4.5% to sulphur wet deposition globally. In certain coastal regions the contributions may be in the range 15\u201350%. In general we find that ship emissions have a large impact on acidic deposition and surface ozone in Western North America, Scandinavia, Western Europe, western North Africa and Malaysia/Indonesia. For most of these regions container traffic, the largest emitter by ship type, has the largest impact. This is the case especially for the Pacific and the related container trade routes between Asia and North America. However, the contributions from bulk ships and tank vessels are also significant in the above mentioned impact regions. Though the total ship impact at low latitudes is lower, the tank vessels have a quite large contribution at low latitudes and near the Gulf of Mexico and Middle East. The bulk ships are characterized by large impact in Oceania compared to other ship types. In Scandinavia and north-Western Europe, one of the major ship impact regions, the three largest ship types have rather small relative contributions. The impact in this region is probably dominated by smaller ships operating closer to the coast. For emissions in ports impacts on NO2 and SO2 seem to be of significance. For most ports the contribution to the two components is in the range 0.5\u20135%, for a few ports it exceeds 10%. The approach presented provides an improvement in characterizing fleet operational patterns, and thereby ship emissions and impacts. Furthermore, the study shows where emission reductions can be applied to most effectively minimize the impacts by different ship types.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "0e0978f0f177b16881e08815100b22e40d7faa5a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2016308449", "DOI": "10.1021/es100520c", "CorpusId": 206935419, "PubMed": "20496930"}, "title": "Environmental implication of electric vehicles in China.", "abstract": "Today, electric vehicles (EVs) are being proposed in China as one of the potential options to address the dramatically increasing energy demand from on-road transport.

In this paper, the effect of these measures on soil acidification is explored. An integrated methodology is used, combining emission inventory data, emission forecasts, air quality modeling, and ecological sensitivities indicated by critical load. National emissions of SO(2), oxides of nitrogen (NO(X)), particulate matter (PM), and ammonia (NH(3)) in 2005 were estimated to be 30.7, 19.6, 31.3, and 16.6 Mt, respectively. Implementation of existing policy will lead to reductions in SO(2) and PM emissions, while those of NO(X) and NH(3) will continue to rise, even under tentatively proposed control measures.

The area in exceedance will decrease to 26% and 20% in 2010 and 2020, respectively, given implementation of current plans for emission reductions. However, the exceedance of the critical load for nitrogen (N, combining effects of eutrophication and acidification) will double from 2005 to 2020 due to increased NO(X) and NH(3) emissions. Combining the acidification effects of S and N, the benefits of SO(2) reductions during 2005-2010 will almost be negated by increased N emissions. Therefore abatement of N emissions (NO(X) and NH(3)) and deposition will be a major challenge to China, requiring policy development and technology investments.

The most important factor influencing these ranges above, for non-Annex I countries, and in the box, for Annex I countries, is new information on higher baseline emissions (e.g. that of Sheehan, Climatic Change, 2008, this issue). Other factors are the assumed global emission level in 2020 and assumptions on land-use change and forestry emissions. The current, slow pace in climate policy and the steady increase in global emissions, make it almost unfeasible to reach relatively low global emission levels in 2020 needed to meet 450\u00a0ppm CO2-eq, as was first assumed feasible by some studies, 5\u00a0years ago.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "c112f510a971a7369998f37e2e635d9377e655e1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2002510716", "DOI": "10.1021/es902662h", "CorpusId": 6415311, "PubMed": "20095574"}, "title": "Understanding changes in the UK's CO2 emissions: a global perspective.", "abstract": "The UK appears to be a leading country in curbing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

We use structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to investigate the drivers behind annual changes in CO(2) emission from consumption in the UK between 1992 and 2004. In contrast with previous SDA-based studies, we apply the decomposition to a global, multiregional input-output model (MRIO), which accounts for UK imports from all regions and uses region-specific production structures and CO(2) intensities. We find that improvements from \"domestic\" changes in efficiency and production structure led to a 148 Mt reduction in CO(2) emissions, which only partially offsets emission increases of 217 Mt from changes in the global supply chain and from growing consumer demand.

Previous methodology studies in Europe have produced country-dependent characterisation factors for acidification and terrestrial eutrophication by using the results of the EMEP and RAINS models and critical loads for Europe. The unprotected ecosystem area (UA) is commonly used as a category indicator in the determination of characterisation factors in those studies. However, the UA indicator is only suitable for large emission changes and it does not result in environmental benefits in terms of characterisation factors if deposition after the emission reduction is still higher than the critical load. For this reason, there is a need to search for a new category indicator type for acidification and terrestrial eutrophying in order to calculate site-dependent characterisation factors. The aim of this study is to explore new site-dependent characterisation factors for European acidifying and eutrophying emissions based on accumulated exceedance (AE) as the category indicator, which integrates both the exceeded area and amount of exceedance. In addition, the results obtained for the AE and UA indicators are compared with each other.Methods The chosen category indicator, accumulated exceedance (AE), was computed according to the calculation methods developed in the work under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP). Sulphur and nitrogen depositions to 150x150 km2 grid cells over Europe were calculated by source-receptor matrices derived from the EMEP Lagrangian model of long-range transport of air pollution in Europe. Using the latest critical load data of Europe, the site-dependent characterisation factors for acidification and terrestrial eutrophication were calculated for 35 European countries and 5 sea areas for 2002 emissions and emissions predicted for 2010. In the determination of characterisation factors, the emissions of each country/area were reduced by various amounts in order to find stable characterisation factors. In addition, characterisation errors were calculated for the AE-based characterisation factors. For the comparison, the results based on the use of UA indicator were calculated by 10% and 50% reductions of emissions that corresponded to the common practice used in the previous studies. Results and Discussion The characterisation factors based on the AE indicator were shown to be largely independent of the reduction percentage used to calculate them.. Small changes in emissions (\u2264100 t) produced the most stable characterisation factors in the case of the AE indicator. The characterisation errors of those characterisation factors were practically zero. This means that the characterisation factors can describe the effects of small changes in national emissions that are mostly looked at in LCAs. The comparison between country-dependent characterisation factors calculated by the AE and UA indicators showed that these two approaches produce differences between characterisation factors for many countries/areas in Europe. The differences were mostly related to the Central and Northern European countries. They were greater for terrestrial eutrophication because the contribution of ammonia emission differ remarkably between the two approaches. The characterisation factors of the AE indicator calculated by the emissions of 2002 were greater than the factors calculated by the predicted emissions for 2010 in almost all countries/sea areas, due to the presumed decrease of acidifying and eutrophying emissions in Europe. Conclusionsand Recommendations. In this study, accumulated exceedance was shown to be an appropriate category indicator in LCIA applications for the determination of site-dependent characterisation factors for acidification and terrestrial eutrophication in the context of integrated assessment modelling. In the future, it would be useful to calculate characterisation factors for emissions of separate parts of large countries and sea areas in Europe. In addition, it would also be useful to compare the approach based on the AE indicator with the method of the hazard index, as recommended in the latest CML guidebook.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "b0bb50eb3adc2c9e71f576447a0af163d7e7dda2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2077567454", "DOI": "10.1021/BI00300A022", "CorpusId": 38590242, "PubMed": "6546881"}, "title": "Quenching of DNA-ethidium fluorescence by amsacrine and other antitumor agents: a possible electron-transfer effect.", "abstract": "The antitumor agent amsacrine, 4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA), when bound to double-stranded DNA, particularly poly(deoxyadenylicthymidylic acid), reduced the fluorescence of bound ethidium without physically displacing it from DNA.

Rather, a proportion of the DNA-bound ethidium changed to a state where the fluorescence was highly quenched.

Here we describe an alternative framework for determining emission equivalence between radiatively active gases that addresses these weaknesses. We focus on limiting temperature change and rate of temperature change, but our framework is also applicable to other objectives.

The relative prices then determine the trade-off between gases at each point in time, taking into account economical as well as physical considerations.

Long-term expo- sure to PM2:5 has been identified as a major contributor to adverse human health effects in epidemiological studies and underpins ambient PM2:5 legislation. As a range of emission sources and atmospheric chemistry transport processes con- tribute to PM2:5 concentrations, atmospheric chemistry trans- port models are an essential tool to assess emissions control effectiveness. The EMEP4UK atmospheric chemistry trans- port model was used to investigate the impact of reductions in UK anthropogenic emissions of primary PM2:5, NH3, NOx, SOx or non-methane VOC on surface concentrations of PM2:5 in the UK for a recent year (2010) and for a future current legislation emission (CLE) scenario (2030). In gen- eral, the sensitivity to UK mitigation is rather small. A 30 % reduction in UK emissions of any one of the above compo- nents yields (for the 2010 simulation) a maximum reduction in PM2:5 in any given location of 0.6 \u00b5g m 3 (equivalent to 6 % of the modelled PM2:5/. On average across the UK, the sensitivity of PM2:5 concentrations to a 30 % reduction in UK emissions of individual contributing components, for both the 2010 and 2030 CLE baselines, increases in the or- der NMVOC, NOx, SOx, NH3 and primary PM2:5; however there are strong spatial differences in the PM2:5 sensitivi- ties across the UK. Consequently, the sensitivity of PM2:5 to individual component emissions reductions varies between area and population weighting. Reductions in NH3 have the greatest effect on area-weighted PM2:5. A full UK population weighting places greater emphasis on reductions of primary PM2:5 emissions, which is simulated to be the most effective single-component control on PM2:5 for the 2030 scenario. An important conclusion is that weighting corresponding to the average exposure indicator metric (using data from the 45 model grids containing a monitor whose measurements are used to calculate the UK AEI) further increases the empha- sis on the effectiveness of primary PM2:5 emissions reduc- tions (and of NOx emissions reductions) relative to the effec- tiveness of NH3 emissions reductions.

However, increasing radiative forcing (RF) due to greenhouse gases and changes in CH4 concentration also contribute to differences in the tropospheric ozone distribution among RCP scenarios. In the RCP4.5 and RCP6.0, assuming the stabilization of RF, the increase in tropospheric ozone due to enhanced residual circulation is cancelled out by the ozone reduction due to ozone precursor reductions.

European emission trends of nitrogen oxides since 1880 and up to present are presented here and are linked to the evolution of road transport emissions. Road transport has been the dominating source of NO x emissions since 1970, and contributes with 40% to the total emissions in 2005. Five trend regimes have been identified between 1880 and 2005. The first regime (1880\u20131950) is determined by a slow increase in fuel consumption all over Europe. The second regime (1950\u20131980) is characterized by a continued steep upward trend in liquid fuel use and by the introduction of the first regulations on road traffic emissions. Reduction in fuel consumption determines the emission trends in the third regime (1980\u20131990) that is also characterized by important differences between Eastern and Western Europe. Emissions from road traffic continue to grow in Western Europe in this period, and it is argued here that the reason for this continued NO x emission increase is related to early inefficient regulations for NO x in the transport sector. The fourth regime (1990\u20132000) involves a turning point for road traffic emissions, with a general decrease of emissions in Europe during that decade. It is in this period that we can identify the first emission reductions due to technological abatement in Western Europe. In the fifth regime (2000\u20132005), the economic recovery in Eastern Europe imposes increased emission from road traffic in this area. Western European emissions are on the other hand decoupled from the fuel consumption, and continue to decrease. The implementation of strict measures to control NO x emissions is demonstrated here to be a main reason for the continued Western European emission reductions. The results indicate that even though the effectiveness of European standards is hampered by a slow vehicle turnover, loopholes in the type-approval testing, and an increase in diesel consumption, the effect of such technical abatement measures is traceable in the evolution of European road traffic emissions over the last 15 years.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "3a86206fe9ffbd937ecefebba29c05e0084863a2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2323224931", "DOI": "10.1021/es2013424", "CorpusId": 206947280, "PubMed": "21910443"}, "title": "Impact of fuel quality regulation and speed reductions on shipping emissions: implications for climate and air quality.", "abstract": "Atmospheric emissions of gas and particulate matter from a large ocean-going container vessel were sampled as it slowed and switched from high-sulfur to low-sulfur fuel as it transited into regulated coastal waters of California.

In general, trading benefits all parties at least some, and from a global standpoint, the gains from trading are greater, the wider and less constrained is the market. The distribution of the gains from trading is, however, highly skewed in favor of those who would face the highest costs in the absence of emissions trading.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "8d32b8228dde1b2564607e1f9eeed54ce04ad2e3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2000218557", "DOI": "10.1080/09613210802645924", "CorpusId": 108771137}, "title": "Retrofitting the existing UK building stock", "abstract": "The recent report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) confirms both the seriousness of the climate change challenge and the deep carbon emission reductions that are needed to avoid the worst consequences.

There is little prospect that this situation will be resolved with a single technological fix. As developing nations quickly move to catch up with the motorization levels of developed nations, the sheer number of private vehicles may overwhelm any advances made by cleaner fuels. By 2030, there is projected to be more vehicles in the developing world than in developed nations. Despite the growth in developing\u2010nation transport emissions, the sector has produced relatively few mitigation projects within the mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol. However, a few developing cities, such as Bogota, Colombia, have demonstrated innovation in low\u2010cost solutions to reducing emissions. This research employs scenario analysis to examine the size and cost of potential emission reduction options from the urban transport sector of developing nations. In particular, the analysis compares the cost of greenhouse gas emission reductions from fuel technology options to reductions from measures promoting mode shifting.

In intensive animal agriculture, high N2O emission rates generally coincide with anaerobic soil conditions and high soil NO3\u2013, primarily from animal urine patches. This paper provides an overview of animal, feed-based and soil or management abatement technologies for ruminant animal agriculture targeted at reducing the size of the soil NO3\u2013 pool or improving soil aeration. Direct measurements of N2O emissions from potential animal and feed-based intervention technologies are scarce. However, studies have shown that they have the potential to reduce urinary N excretion by 3\u201360% and thus reduce associated N2O emissions. Research on the effect of soil and water management interventions is generally further advanced and N2O reduction potentials of up to 90% have been measured in some instances. Of the currently available technologies, nitrification inhibitors, managing animal diets and fertiliser management show the best potential for reducing emissions in the short-term. However, strategies should always be evaluated in a whole-system context, to ensure that reductions in one part of the system do not stimulate higher emissions elsewhere. Current technologies reviewed here could deliver up to 50% reduction from an animal housing system, but only up to 15% from a grazing-based system. However, given that enteric methane emissions form the majority of emissions from grazing systems, a 15% abatement of N2O is likely to translate to a 2\u20134% decrease in total GHG emissions at a farm scale.

First, cap-and-trade would increase gasoline prices as refiners and fuel importers pass on the cost of carbon allowances; a $30 per metric ton price of carbon allowances equates to 27 cents per gallon of gasoline. Second, transit, smart growth, and other emission reduction projects might be eligible for billions of dollars in revenue from carbon allowance auctions. Third, as emissions would be constrained at the level of the cap, transportation projects would be unlikely to have any impact on aggregate emissions. Any environmental benefit of a project (reduced emissions) would be converted into an economic benefit (reduced carbon allowance prices and thus reduced compliance costs in other sectors). Fourth, the converse of this argument suggests a weakening of the potential to use the environmental review process to mitigate emissions from development projects. There may be an economic impact (higher carbon allowance prices), but not an environmental impact (emissions would be constrained at the level of the cap).

Reducing and changing energy use is preferred as an option over sequestering carbon. Under non\u2010cooperation, free riding as well as assurance behaviour is observed in the model.

We show the existence of a positive and time-dependent correlation between the Human Development Index (HDI) and per capita CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Employing this empirical relation, extrapolating the HDI, and using three population scenarios, the cumulative CO2 emissions necessary for developing countries to achieve particular HDI thresholds are assessed following a Development As Usual approach (DAU). If current demographic and development trends are maintained, we estimate that by 2050 around 85% of the world\u2019s population will live in countries with high HDI (above 0.8). In particular, 300 Gt of cumulative CO2 emissions between 2000 and 2050 are estimated to be necessary for the development of 104 developing countries in the year 2000. This value represents between 20 % to 30 % of previously calculated CO2 budgets limiting global warming to 2\u00b0C. These constraints and results are incorporated into a CO2 reduction framework involving four domains of climate action for individual countries. The framework reserves a fair emission path for developing countries to proceed with their development by indexing country-dependent reduction rates proportional to the HDI in order to preserve the 2\u00b0C target after a particular development threshold is reached. For example, in each time step of five years, countries with an HDI of 0.85 would need to reduce their per capita emissions by approx. 17% and countries with an HDI of 0.9 by 33 %.

These changes have taken place during a period in which the primary gases and the wet deposition throughout Europe were extensively monitored. Since the end of the 1970s, for example land based sulphur emissions declined by between 90 and 70% depending on the region. Over the same period the total deposition of sulphur and its partitioning into wet and dry deposition have declined, but the spatial pattern in the reduction in deposition differs from that of emission and has changed with time. Such non-linearities in the emission-deposition relationship are important to understand as they complicate the process of assessing the effects of emission reduction strategies. Observed non-linearities in terrestrial sulphur emission-deposition patterns have been identified in north west Europe due to increases in marine emissions, and are currently slowing the recovery of freshwater ecosystems. Changes in the relative amounts of SO2 and NH3 in air over the last two decades have also changed the affinity of terrestrial surfaces for SO2 and have therefore changed the deposition velocity of SO2 over substantial areas. The consequence of this effect has been the very rapid reduction in ambient SO2 concentration in some of the major source areas of Europe, where NH3 did not change much. Interactions between the different pollutants, generating non-linearities are now being incorporated in long-range transport models to simulate the effects of historical emission trends and to provide projections into the future.

Although in many countries emphasis is put on reduction of environmental pollution by nutrients, ammonia emission and odour nuisance, reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases will become equally important in the near future to meet integrated sustainability criteria (1997 Kyoto protocol). Emissions of greenhouse gases differ in origin. Methane from animal husbandry is for a large part endogenous, and may be hard to reduce in intensive animal production. Methane emission reduction strategies should focus on its use as fuel or preventing its formation, mainly during on-farm storage (indoor, outside) or treatment through control of critical processes (degradation of organic matter) and critical factors (e.g., temperature). Nitrous oxide is mainly produced during the aerobic storage and treatment of animal excreta, as well as after land spreading.

From CO2 point of view, gasoline engines suffer from an handicap in comparison to Diesel engines. Reduction of size of gasoline engine (downsizing) appears to be a promising way to improve engine efficiency and is subject to extensive research. Having a look to the long term, the aim should be to reduce by half the engine displacement volume. Calculation results from a vehicle simulation illustrate that even a so extensive downsizing will not be enough to bring the entire gasoline fleet to the requested CO2 levels. It would just be sufficient to reach the targeted levels for year 2008 for a mid-class vehicle powered by a downsized 0. 8 l engine instead of a current 1. 6l gasoline engine. Reduction of CO2 emission is in that case about 18% in warm engine conditions. Then, further improvements have to be achieved in terms of gasoline engine specific fuel consumption, especially for bigger cars. IFP has developed an innovative approach combining two energy saving technologies that are gasoline direct injection and turbocharger with renewed definition of valve timing. This has been applied on a 1. 8l engine. An unconventional combustion chamber scavenging process becomes then feasible on a turbocharged engine. Knock resistance and volumetric efficiency are improved. The close interactions between combustion, turbocharger and valve timing have been analysed and optimised.

The paper shows that all relevant current variables of the FUND model have finite variances. However, there is a small chance that climate change reverses economic growth in some regions. In that case, the discount rate becomes negative and the net present marginal benefits of greenhouse gas emission reduction becomes very large. So large, that its variance is unbounded.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "c128f8d07a83e3438bb040348c78ccd2814f6b18", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2168875663", "DOI": "10.1073/PNAS.93.11.5539", "CorpusId": 20014285, "PubMed": "8643611"}, "title": "Dopamine transporters are markedly reduced in Lesch-Nyhan disease in vivo.", "abstract": "Dopamine (DA) deficiency has been implicated in Lesch-Nyhan disease (LND), a genetic disorder that is characterized by hyperuricemia, choreoathetosis, dystonia, and compulsive self-injury. To establish that DA deficiency is present in LND, the ligand WIN-35,428, which binds to DA transporters, was used to estimate the density of DA-containing neurons in the caudate and putamen of six patients with classic LND. Comparisons were made with 10 control subjects and 3 patients with Rett syndrome. Three methods were used to quantify the binding of the DA transporter so that its density could be estimated by a single dynamic positron emission tomography study. These approaches included the caudate- or putamen-to-cerebellum ratio of ligand at 80-90 min postinjection, kinetic analysis of the binding potential [Bmax/(Kd x Vd)] using the assumption of equal partition coefficients in the striatum and the cerebellum, and graphical analysis of the binding potential. Depending on the method of analysis, a 50-63% reduction of the binding to DA transporters in the caudate, and a 64-75% reduction in the putamen of the LND patients was observed compared to the normal control group. When LND patients were compared to Rett syndrome patients, similar reductions were found in the caudate (53-61%) and putamen (67-72%) in LND patients. Transporter binding in Rett syndrome patients was not significantly different from the normal controls. Finally, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging studies detected a 30% reduction in the caudate volume of LND patients. To ensure that a reduction in the caudate volume would not confound the results, a rigorous partial volume correction of the caudate time activity curve was performed. This correction resulted in an even greater decrease in the caudate-cerebellar ratio in LND patients when contrasted to controls. To our knowledge, these findings provide the first in vivo documentation of a dopaminergic reduction in LND and illustrate the role of positron emission tomography imaging in investigating neurodevelopmental disorders.", "year": 1996}, {"paperId": "ab2554969c99913c8c6c86534af2657ed3bc2cd5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2020167012", "DOI": "10.1115/1.483191", "CorpusId": 108783064}, "title": "Variable composition hydrogen/natural gas mixtures for increased engine efficiency and decreased emissions", "abstract": "It is well known that adding hydrogen to natural gas extends the lean limit of combustion and that in this way extremely low emission levels can be obtained: even the equivalent zero emission vehicle (EZEV) requirements can be reached. The emissions reduction is especially important at light engine loads. In this paper results are presented for a GM V8 engine. Natural gas, pure hydrogen and different blends of these two fuels have been tested. The fuel supply system used provides natural gas/hydrogen mixtures in variable proportion, regulated independently of the engine operating condition. The influence of the fuel composition on the engine operating characteristics and exhaust emissions has been examined, mainly but not exclusively for 10 and 20 percent hydrogen addition. At least 10 percent hydrogen addition is necessary for a significant improvement in efficiency. Due to the conflicting requirements for low hydrocarbons and low NO x , determining the optimum hythane composition is not straight-forward. For hythane mixtures with a high hydrogen fraction, it is found that a hydrogen content of 80 percent or less guarantees safe engine operation (no backfire nor knock), whatever the air excess factor. It is shown that to obtain maximum engine efficiency for the whole load range while taking low exhaust emissions into account, the mixture composition should be varied with respect to engine load.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "aa7a0998802716d9c06c3f3fb2ac3e54819b0310", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1998592276", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-006-0433-4", "CorpusId": 56390041}, "title": "Abatement of Greenhouse Gases: Does Location Matter?", "abstract": "Today's climate policy is based on the assumption that the location of emissions reductions has no impact on the overall climate effect. However, this may not be the case since reductions of greenhouse gases generally will lead to changes in emissions of short-lived gases and aerosols. Abatement measures may be primarily targeted at reducing CO2, but may also simultaneously reduce emissions of NOx, CO, CH4 and SO2 and aerosols. Emissions of these species may cause significant additional radiative forcing. We have used a global 3-D chemical transport model and a radiative transfer model to study the impact on climate in terms of radiative forcing for a realistic change in location of the emissions from large-scale sources. Based on an assumed 10% reduction in CO2 emissions, reductions in the emissions of other species have been estimated. Climate impact for the SRES A1B scenario is compared to two reduction cases, with the main focus on a case with emission reductions between 2010 and 2030, but also a case with sustained emission reductions. The emission reductions are applied to four different regions (Europe, China, South Asia, and South America). In terms of integrated radiative forcing (over 100 yr), the total effect (including only the direct effect of aerosols) is always smaller than for CO2 alone. Large variations between the regions are found (53\u201386% of the CO2 effect). Inclusion of the indirect effects of sulphate aerosols reduces the net effect of measures towards zero. The global temperature responses, calculated with a simple energy balance model, show an initial additional warming of different magnitude between the regions followed by a more uniform reduction in the warming later. A major part of the regional differences can be attributed to differences related to aerosols, while ozone and changes in methane lifetime make relatively small contributions. Emission reductions in a different sector (e.g. transportation instead of large-scale sources) might change this conclusion since the NOx to SO2 ratio in the emissions is significantly higher for transportation than for large-scale sources. The total climate effect of abatement measures thus depends on (i) which gases and aerosols are affected by the measure, (ii) the lifetime of the measure implemented, (iii) time horizon over which the effects are considered, and (iv) the chemical, physical and meteorological conditions in the region. There are important policy implications of the results. Equal effects of a measure cannot be assumed if the measure is implemented in a different region and if several gases are affected. Thus, the design of emission reduction measures should be considered thoroughly before implementation.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "bfbd131093e7e4efc7a010448e60fc958eb51e84", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2051849799", "DOI": "10.1029/2005JD005908", "CorpusId": 15296590}, "title": "Net radiative forcing due to changes in regional emissions of tropospheric ozone precursors", "abstract": "[1]\u00a0The global distribution of tropospheric ozone (O3) depends on the emission of precursors, chemistry, and transport. For small perturbations to emissions, the global radiative forcing resulting from changes in O3 can be expressed as a sum of forcings from emission changes in different regions. Tropospheric O3 is considered in present climate policies only through the inclusion of indirect effect of CH4 on radiative forcing through its impact on O3 concentrations. The short-lived O3 precursors (NOx, CO, and NMHCs) are not directly included in the Kyoto Protocol or any similar climate mitigation agreement. In this study, we quantify the global radiative forcing resulting from a marginal reduction (10%) in anthropogenic emissions of NOx alone from nine geographic regions and a combined marginal reduction in NOx, CO, and NMHCs emissions from three regions. We simulate, using the global chemistry transport model MOZART-2, the change in the distribution of global O3 resulting from these emission reductions. In addition to the short-term reduction in O3, these emission reductions also increase CH4 concentrations (by decreasing OH); this increase in CH4 in turn counteracts part of the initial reduction in O3 concentrations. We calculate the global radiative forcing resulting from the regional emission reductions, accounting for changes in both O3 and CH4. Our results show that changes in O3 production and resulting distribution depend strongly on the geographical location of the reduction in precursor emissions. We find that the global O3 distribution and radiative forcing are most sensitive to changes in precursor emissions from tropical regions and least sensitive to changes from midlatitude and high-latitude regions. Changes in CH4 and O3 concentrations resulting from NOx emission reductions alone produce offsetting changes in radiative forcing, leaving a small positive residual forcing (warming) for all regions. In contrast, for combined reductions of anthropogenic emissions of NOx, CO, and NMHCs, changes in O3 and CH4 concentrations result in a net negative radiative forcing (cooling). Thus we conclude that simultaneous reductions of CO, NMHCs, and NOx lead to a net reduction in radiative forcing due to resulting changes in tropospheric O3 and CH4 while reductions in NOx emissions alone do not.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "a0a5cfbe40ad4877456084821a3bc2d0e2cdbd6f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2117314123", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1008314205375", "CorpusId": 13879884}, "title": "Spatial and Temporal Efficiency in Climate Policy: Applications of FUND", "abstract": "FUND is an integrated assessment model of the interactions between climate and economy.

The analyses confirm that co-operation matters, resulting in substantially lower costs or higher welfare. The real commitments of policy targets based on an absolute level (e.g., 1990 emissions) are hard to estimate because of the uncertainties in the baseline.
