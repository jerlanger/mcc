These studies considered different allocation approaches, according to equity principles. The effect of the assumed global emissions cap in these studies is analysed. For developed countries, the original reduction range of 25\u201340% by 2020 is still within the average range of all studies, but does not cover it completely. Comparing the studies shows that assuming a global emissions cap of 5\u201315% above 1990 levels by 2020 generally leads to more stringent reduction targets than when a global emissions cap of 20\u201330% above 1990 levels is assumed. For developing countries, the reduction range of 15\u201330% below their baseline levels by 2020 corresponds to an increase on the 1990 level from 70% (about the 2006 level) to 120%.

Here, it is found, through simulations in which 12 identifiable effects of aerosol particles on climate are treated, that any emission reduction of fossil-fuel (f.f.) particulate BC plus associated organic matter (OM) may slow global warming more than may any emission reduction of CO 2 or CH 4 for a specific period. When all f.f. BC + OM and anthropogenic CO 2 and CH 4 emissions are eliminated together, the period is 25-100 years. It is also estimated that historical net global warming can be attributed roughly to greenhouse gas plus f.f. BC + OM warming minus substantial cooling by other particles. Eliminating all f.f. BC + OM could eliminate 20-45% of net warming (8-18% of total warming before cooling is subtracted out) within 3-5 years if no other change occurred. Reducing CO 2 emissions by a third would have the same effect, but after 50-200 years. Finally, diesel cars emitting continuously under the most recent U.S. and E.U. particulate standards (0.08 g/mi; 0.05 g/km) may warm climate per distance driven over the next 100+ years more than equivalent gasoline cars. Thus, fuel and carbon tax laws that favor diesel appear to promote global warming. Toughening vehicle particulate emission standards by a factor of 8 (0.01 g/ mi; 0.006 g/km) does not change this conclusion, although it shortens the period over which diesel cars warm to 13-54 years.

In 2016, the ICAO decided to implement a Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) and in 2017 the EU decided on faster emission reductions in its Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), which since 2012 includes the aviation sector. The effects of these policies on the expected development of air travel emissions from 2017 to 2030 have been analyzed. For the sample country Sweden, the analysis shows that when emissions reductions in other sectors are attributed to the aviation sector as a result of the EU ETS and CORSIA, carbon emissions are expected to reduce by \u22120.8% per year (however if non-CO2 emissions are included in the analysis, then emissions will increase). This is much less than what is needed to achieve the 2\u00b0C target. Our analysis of potential national aviation policy instruments shows that there are legally feasible options that could mitigate emissions in addition to the EU ETS and CORSIA. Distance-based air passenger taxes are common among EU Member States and through increased ticket prices these taxes can reduce demand for air travel and thus reduce emissions. Tax on jet fuel is an option for domestic aviation and for international aviation if bilateral agreements are concluded. A quota obligation for biofuels is a third option. Key policy insights Existing international climate policies for aviation will not deliver any major emission reductions. Policymakers who want to significantly push the aviation sector to contribute to meeting the 2\u00b0C target need to work towards putting in place tougher international policy instruments in the long term, and simultaneously implement temporary national policy instruments in the near-term. Distance-based air passenger taxes, carbon taxes on jet fuel and quota obligations for biofuels are available national policy options; if they are gradually increased, and harmonized with other countries, they can help to significantly reduce emissions.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "2ddbd4ddafbdb43c25156ad65276db2819aa8011", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2068247081", "DOI": "10.1021/la900905h", "CorpusId": 19750676, "PubMed": "19453127"}, "title": "Graphene-semiconductor nanocomposites: excited-state interactions between ZnO nanoparticles and graphene oxide.", "abstract": "Graphene oxide sheets suspended in ethanol interact with excited ZnO nanoparticles and undergo photocatalytic reduction.

Patients fulfilled DSM-IV criteria for schizophrenia, had no history of alcohol or substance abuse or dependence, and were neuroleptic free for a minimum of 21 days. Amphetamine-induced dopamine release was assessed by the reduction in dopamine D2 receptor availability induced by an acute amphetamine challenge (0.3 mg/kg, intravenous bolus). Reduction in D2 receptor availability was measured with single photon emission computed tomography and the D2 receptor radiotracer [123I]IBZM.\n\n\nRESULTS\nNo differences were observed between patients with schizophrenia and the comparison group in D2 receptor availability at baseline. Patients with schizophrenia exhibited a significantly larger reduction in D2 receptor availability following acute amphetamine challenge than the comparison group.

The hypothesis is barely rejected for Asia but strongly accepted for Latin America and, particularly, Africa. The explanation for the difference is that development (aid) reduces vulnerabilities in some sectors (infectious diseases, water resources, agriculture) but increases vulnerabilities in others (cardiovascular diseases, energy consumption). However, climate change impacts are much higher in Latin America and Africa than in Asia, so that money spent on emission reduction for the sake of avoiding impacts in developing countries is better spent on vulnerability reduction in those countries.

Methane and ozone are also important greenhouse gases. Reducing methane emissions therefore decreases surface ozone everywhere while slowing climate warming, but although methane mitigation has been considered to address climate change, it has not for air quality. Here we show that global decreases in surface ozone concentrations, due to methane mitigation, result in substantial and widespread decreases in premature human mortality. Reducing global anthropogenic methane emissions by 20% beginning in 2010 would decrease the average daily maximum 8-h surface ozone by approximately 1 part per billion by volume globally. By using epidemiologic ozone-mortality relationships, this ozone reduction is estimated to prevent approximately 30,000 premature all-cause mortalities globally in 2030, and approximately 370,000 between 2010 and 2030. If only cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities are considered, approximately 17,000 global mortalities can be avoided in 2030. The marginal cost-effectiveness of this 20% methane reduction is estimated to be approximately 420,000 US dollars per avoided mortality. If avoided mortalities are valued at 1 US dollars million each, the benefit is approximately 240 US dollars per tone of CH(4) ( approximately 12 US dollars per tone of CO(2) equivalent), which exceeds the marginal cost of the methane reduction. These estimated air pollution ancillary benefits of climate-motivated methane emission reductions are comparable with those estimated previously for CO(2).

To explore the relationship between tropospheric ozone and radiative forcing with changing emissions, we compiled two sets of global scenarios for the emissions of the ozone precursors methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) up to the year 2030 and implemented them in two global Chemistry Transport Models. The \"Current Legislation\" (CLE) scenario reflects the current perspectives of individual countries on future economic development and takes the anticipated effects of presently decided emission control legislation in the individual countries into account. In addition, we developed a \"Maximum technically Feasible Reduction\" (MFR) scenario that outlines the scope for emission reductions offered by full implementation of the presently available emission control technologies, while maintaining the projected levels of anthropogenic activities. Whereas the resulting projections of methane emissions lie within the range suggested by other greenhouse gas projections, the recent pollution control legislation of many Asian countries, requiring introduction of catalytic converters for vehicles, leads to significantly lower growth in emissions of the air pollutants NOx, NMVOC and CO than was suggested by the widely used and more pessimistic IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) SRES (Special Report on Emission Scenarios) scenarios (Nakicenovic et al., 2000), which made Business-as-Usual assumptions regarding emission control technology. With the TM3 and STOCHEM models we performed several long-term integrations (1990-2030) to assess global, hemispheric and regional changes in CH4, CO, hydroxyl radicals, ozone and the radiative climate forcings resulting from these two emission scenarios. Both models reproduce broadly the observed trends in CO, and CH4 concentrations from 1990 to 2002. For the \"current legislation\" case, both models indicate an increase of the annual average ozone levels in the Northern Hemisphere by 5ppbv, and up to 15ppbv over the Indian sub-continent, comparing the 2020s (2020-2030) with the 1990s (1990-2000). The corresponding higher ozone and methane burdens in the atmosphere increase radiative forcing by approximately 0.2 Wm-2. Full application of today's emissions control technologies, however, would bring down ozone below the levels experienced in the 1990s and would reduce the radiative forcing of ozone and methane to approximately -0.1 Wm-2. This can be compared to the 0.14-0.47 Wm-2 increase of methane and ozone radiative forcings associated with the SRES scenarios. While methane reductions lead to lower ozone burdens and to less radiative forcing, further reductions of the air pollutants NOx and NMVOC result in lower ozone, but at the same time increase the lifetime of methane. Control of methane emissions appears an efficient option to reduce tropospheric ozone as well as radiative forcing.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "8b9d196561452a9b5fa54c2398aed3a02397e641", "externalIds": {"ArXiv": "astro-ph/0602160", "MAG": "2012677650", "DOI": "10.1086/500091", "CorpusId": 119481680}, "title": "The Boston University-Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory Galactic Ring Survey", "abstract": "The Boston University-Five College Radio Astronomy Observatory Galactic Ring Survey is a new survey of Galactic 13CO J = 1 \u2192 0 emission.

The sum of the O-3 responses to NOx, CO, and NMVOC decreases separately is approximately equal to that from a simultaneous reduction of all precursors. We define a continental-scale \"import sensitivity\" as the ratio of the O-3 response to the 20% reductions in foreign versus \"domestic\" (i.e., over the source region itself) emissions. For example, the combined reduction of emissions from the three foreign regions produces an ensemble spatial mean decrease of 0.6 ppb over EU (0.4 ppb from NA), less than the 0.8 ppb from the reduction of EU emissions, leading to an import sensitivity ratio of 0.7. The ensemble mean surface O-3 response to foreign emissions is largest in spring and late fall (0.7-0.9 ppb decrease in all regions from the combined precursor reductions in the three foreign regions), with import sensitivities ranging from 0.5 to 1.1 (responses to domestic emission reductions are 0.8-1.6 ppb). High O-3 values are much more sensitive to domestic emissions than to foreign emissions, as indicated by lower import sensitivities of 0.2 to 0.3 during July in EA, EU, and NA when O-3 levels are typically highest and by the weaker relative response of annual incidences of daily maximum 8-h average O-3 above 60 ppb to emission reductions in a foreign region(< 10-20% of that to domestic) as compared to the annual mean response (up to 50% of that to domestic). Applying the ensemble annual mean results to changes in anthropogenic emissions from 1996 to 2002, we estimate a Northern Hemispheric increase in background surface O-3 of about 0.1 ppb a(-1), at the low end of the 0.1-0.5 ppb a(-1) derived from observations. From an additional simulation in which global atmospheric methane was reduced, we infer that 20% reductions in anthropogenic methane emissions from a foreign source region would yield an O-3 response in a receptor region that roughly equals that produced by combined 20% reductions of anthropogenic NOx, NMVOC, and CO emissions from the foreign source", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "932fcc43a4862e919445084ed89b81043a178e8b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1999512948", "DOI": "10.3155/1047-3289.57.12.1489", "CorpusId": 25862277, "PubMed": "18200934"}, "title": "Response of Inorganic Fine Particulate Matter to Emission Changes of Sulfur Dioxide and Ammonia: The Eastern United States as a Case Study", "abstract": "Abstract A three-dimensional chemical transport model (PMCAMx) was used to investigate changes in fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations in response to changes in sulfur dioxide (SO2) and ammonia (NH3) emissions during July 2001 and January 2002 in the eastern United States. A uniform 50% reduction in SO2 emissions was predicted to produce an average decrease of PM2.5 concentrations by 26% during July but only 6% during January. A 50% reduction of NH3 emissions leads to an average 4 and 9% decrease in PM2.5 in July and January, respectively. During the summer, the highest concentration of sulfate is in South Indiana (12.8 \u03bcg m-3), and the 50% reduction of SO2 emissions results in a 5.7 \u03bcg m-3(44%) sulfate decrease over this area. During winter, the SO2 emissions reduction results in a 1.5 \u03bcg m-3 (29%) decrease of the peak sulfate levels (5.2 \u03bcg m-3) over Southeast Georgia. The maximum nitrate and ammonium concentrations are predicted to be over the Midwest (1.9 \u03bcg m-3 in Ohio and 5.3 \u03bcg m-3 in South Indiana, respectively) in the summer whereas in the winter these concentrations are higher over the Northeast (3 \u03bcg m-3 of nitrate in Connecticut and 2.7 \u03bcg m-3 of ammonium in New York). The 50% NH3 emissions reduction is more effective for controlling nitrate, compared with SO2 reductions, producing a 1.1 \u03bcg m-3 nitrate decrease over Ohio in July and a 1.2 \u03bcg m-3 decrease over Connecticut in January. Ammonium decreases significantly when either SO2 or NH3 emissions are decreased. However, the SO2 control strategy has better results in July when ammonium decreases, up to 2 \u03bcg m-3 (37%), are predicted in South Indiana.

With both diesel and lean\u2010burn gasoline engines, the nitrogen oxides are emissted under oxidising conditions. It is scientifically very challenging to reduce nitrogen oxides under oxidising conditions. After a short survey of conventional three\u2010way catalysts, and the associated fundamental aspects of NOx reduction under stoichoimetric conditions, this review focuses on the knowledge and know\u2010how that has been developed for lean engine emission control. Early research on hydrocarbon selective catalytic reduction on zeolite, oxide, and metal\u2010based systems is examined, and some of the key mechanistic models are described. Since none of these systems are of sufficient activity and stability to satisfy current legislation attention has turned to NOx storage and reduction systems. The basic principles of these are described, and the present state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms of storage and regeneration are discussed. The many apparent discrepancies are highlighted and an attempt is made to rationalise the current state of knowledge by taking into account the varying experimental conditions reported nit he literature.

The Durban Platform scenarios investigated in the LIMITS study \u2014 all assuming the implementation of comprehensive global emission reductions after 2020, but assuming different 2020 emission reduction levels as well as different long-term concentration targets \u2014 exhibit a probability of exceeding the 2\u00b0C limit of 22\u201341% when reaching 450 (450\u2013480) ppm CO2e, and 35\u201359% when reaching 500 (480\u2013520) ppm CO2e in 2100. Forcing and temperature show a peak and decline pattern for both targets. Consistency of the resulting temperature trajectory with the 2\u00b0C target is a societal choice, and may be based on the maximum exceedance probability at the time of the peak and the long run exceedance probability, e.g., in the year 2100. The challenges of implementing a long-term target after a period of fragmented near-term climate policy can be significant as reflected in steep reductions of emissions intensity and transitional and long-term economic impacts. In particular, the challenges of adopting the target are significantly higher in 2030 than in 2020, both in terms of required emissions intensity decline rates and economic impacts.

New suggestions in NOE consisted in introducing (1) biological site\u2010specific parameters of soil N2O reduction and (2) reduction of the N2O produced through nitrification to N2 through denitrification.

For 80% of the tested points, measured and simulated fluxes are in accordance whereas the others resulted in an important discrepancy. The origin of this discrepancy is discussed. On the other hand, mean annual fluxes measured on each site were strongly correlated to mean simulated annual fluxes. The biological site\u2010specific parameter of soil N2O reduction introduced into NOE appeared particularly useful to discriminate the general level of N2O emissions from site to site.

In an emission sensitive market, emission reduction not only brings the higher production costs but also stimulates the inverse demand function. Therefore, this may be an opportunity for players of the supply chain to coordinate their two objectives: environmental pressure (to reduce carbon emissions for environment protection) and profit-seeking, which intuitively seem to be contradictory. In order to address this research focus, a novel emission-sensitive demand function is adopted, and an emission -sensitive cost function is introduced explicitly to capture the deviation production cost caused by emission reduction. Then the decision-making of each member in the emission-concerned supply chain is investigated. We find that the decision-maker of the supply chain will choose different emission reduction strategies for different cases. An inspiring result shows that the channel profit as well as the emission reduction increase in the consumers\u2019 preference to low-carbon consumption simultaneously in particular cases. Moreover, several emission-concerned contracts are designed to coordinate the channel. Another finding is that the manufacturer\u2019s optimal carbon emissions per unit product keeps the same as the centralised channel, no matter whether the supply chain is coordinated or not.

A satellite-based time-series of Amazonian deforestation rates and fire incidence suggests an increased trend in fire incidence across most of the region, despite the overall decrease in deforestation rates. The survey also suggests that the introduction of managed agriculture, instead of traditional slash-and-burn land use in already deforested areas, may promote a reduction of in fire incidence in the Amazon. Without a fire policy in place, emission reductions from reduced deforestation are likely to be offset by increased carbon dioxide emissions from fires. Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) may curb carbon emissions, but the consequences for fire hazard are poorly understood. By analyzing satellite-derived deforestation and fire data from the Brazilian Amazon, we show that fire occurrence has increased in 59% of the area that has experienced reduced deforestation rates. Differences in fire frequencies across two land-use gradients reveal that fire-free land-management can substantially reduce fire incidence by as much as 69%.

The need for international tourism leadership to improve sectoral scale emission monitoring capacity to meet the increasing requirements for transparency, convene an assessment of risks from climate change and climate policy, foster greater collaboration on destination climate resilience and accelerate technological, policy and social innovation to put tourism firmly on a pathway to the low-carbon economy are all emphasized, as is the need for dialogue between tourism and tourism researchers.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "54a09e028638ea4a13e6957a82f5aec53827e605", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1991841036", "DOI": "10.1021/ES960910+", "CorpusId": 129438634}, "title": "Sunlight-Mediated Emission of Elemental Mercury from Soil Amended with Municipal Sewage Sludge", "abstract": "We studied the fate and atmospheric emission of mercury (Hg) from soil amended with municipal sewage sludge using a Teflon dynamic flux chamber.

Emission records covered nine consecutive seasons from 1994 to 1998 and showed a distinct seasonal pattern: an early flush of CH4 before transplanting, an increasing trend in emission rates reaching maximum toward grain ripening, and a second flush after water is withdrawn prior to harvesting. The local practice of crop management, which consists of continuous flooding and urea application, resulted in 79\u2013184 mg CH4 m\u22122 d\u22121 in the dry season (DS) and 269\u2013503 mg CH4 m\u22122 d\u22121 in the wet season (WS). The higher emission in the WS may be attributed to more labile carbon accumulation during the dry fallow period before the WS cropping as shown by higher % organic C. Incorporation of sulfate into the soil reduced CH4 emission rates. The use of ammonium sulfate as N fertilizer in place of urea resulted in a 25\u201336% reduction in CH4 emissions. Phosphogypsum reduced CH4 emissions by 72% when applied in combination with urea fertilizer. Midseason drainage reduced CH4 emission by 43%, which can be explained by the influx of oxygen into the soil. The practice of direct seeding instead of transplanting resulted in a 16\u201354% reduction in CH4 emission, but the mechanisms for the reducing effect are not clear. Addition of rice straw compost increased CH4 emission by only 23\u201330% as compared with the 162\u2013250% increase in emissions with the use of fresh rice straw. Chicken manure combined with urea did not increase CH4 emission. Fresh rice straw has wider C/N (25 to 45) while rice straw compost has C/N = 6 to 10 and chicken manure has C/N = 5 to 8. Modifications in inorganic and organic fertilizer management and water regime did not adversely affect grain yield and are therefore potential mitigation options. Direct seeding has a lower yield potential than transplanting but is getting increasingly popular among farmers due to labor savings. Combined with a package of technologies, CH4 emission can best be reduced by (1) the practice of midseason drainage instead of continuous flooding, (2) the use of sulfate-containing fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate and phosphogypsum combined with urea; (3) direct seeding crop establishment; and (4) use of low C/N organic fertilizer such as chicken manure and rice straw compost.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "adb036f22c7976e573a5b327076406611390fdf9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2055181258", "DOI": "10.1063/1.1320009", "CorpusId": 122360355}, "title": "Electron field emission for ultrananocrystalline diamond films", "abstract": "Ultrananocrystalline diamond (UNCD) films 0.1\u20132.4 \u03bcm thick were conformally deposited on sharp single Si microtip emitters, using microwave CH4\u2013Ar plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition in combination with a dielectrophoretic seeding process.

A list of possible noise sources is given. Through a series of experiments, all but one source is eliminated as being important, and the remaining source is shown to be dominant. The dominant noise source is the ovalizing deformation of the stator due to its radial magnetic attraction to the rotor. The emitted noise is particularly strong when the frequency of deformation coincides with that of a natural mechanical resonance of the stator. Several methods of reducing acoustic noise emission are studied. One successful method is the introduction of dither into the control of the motor in order to spread the spectrum of noise excitation and reduce its coupling to the mechanical resonance of the stator. >", "year": 1992}, {"paperId": "f8199c8773b6f1b2bcfadff636378ab01dc04295", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1971190664", "DOI": "10.1006/JEEM.1996.0953", "CorpusId": 153387253}, "title": "The Choice between Emission Taxes and Output Taxes under Imperfect Monitoring", "abstract": "We consider a regulator's choice between environmentally motivated emissions taxes and output taxes.

The secondary NOx control technologies applied on U.S. coal-fired utility boilers include reburning, selective noncatalytic reduction (SNCR), and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Thirty-six U.S. coal-fired utility boilers have installed SNCR, and reported NOx reductions achieved at these applications ranged from 15% to 66%. Recently, SCR has been installed at >150 U.S. coal-fired utility boilers.

In view of policy goals to increase the energy supply from biomass and current efforts to produce biobased polymers in bulk, the amount of available land for the production of nonfood crops could become a limitation. Hence, given the prominence of energy and greenhouse issues in current environmental policy, it is desirable to include land demand in the comparison of different biomass options. Over the past few years, numerous LCA studies have been prepared for different types of bio\u2010based polymers, but only a few of these studies address the aspect of land use. This comparison shows that referring energy savings and GHG emission reduction of biobased polymers to a unit of agricultural land, instead of to a unit of polymer produced, leads to a different ranking of options. If land use is chosen as the basis of comparison, natural fiber composites and thermoplastic starch score better than bioenergy production from energy crops, whereas polylactides score comparably well and polyhydroxyalkaonates score worse. Additionally, including the use of agricultural residues for energy purposes improves the environmental performance of bio\u2010based polymers significantly.

Carbon accounting includes: emissions due to fossil fuel use in the production of building materials; the replacement of fossil fuels by biomass residues from logging, wood processing, construction and demolition; carbon stock changes in forests and buildings; and cement process reactions. The results show that wood-framed construction requires less energy, and emits less CO2 to the atmosphere, than concrete-framed construction. The lifecycle emission difference between the wood- and concrete-framed buildings ranges from 30 to 130 kg C per m2 of floor area. Hence, a net reduction of CO2 emission can be obtained by increasing the proportion of wood-based building materials, relative to concrete materials. The benefits would be greatest if the biomass residues resulting from the production of the wood building materials were fully used in energy supply systems.

In the past, a method of injecting fuel at the initial stage of the compression stroke has been proposed, but it is known that fuel adheres to the cylinder wall, causing a decline in combustion efficiency and oil dilution. The authors have developed Premixed Compression Ignition (PCI) combustion as a technology of solving the above problem as well as simultaneously reducing NOx and soot. In PCI combustion, fuel is injected into a combustion chamber in the vicinity of the top dead center for preventing fuel from adhering to the wall, and pre-mixture, which is formed shortly before ignition, is burnt. By pre-mixing, this combustion reduces the over-rich region of the mixture to reduce soot emissions, and at the same time lowers the combustion temperature by introducing a large amount of EGR to reduce NOx emissions. This paper reports the result of detailed examination of the basic characteristics of PCI combustion using a single-cylinder engine, and that PCI combustion which uses our investigated approaching can achieve substantial and simultaneous reduction of NOx and soot. This paper also studies the possibility of realizing Split-PCI combustion, which uses the two different combustion modes of PCI combustion and diffusion combustion during one cycle, in high-load operation where application of PCI combustion is restricted by diesel knock.

Depending on the parameter values, emission reduction ranges from draconian to almost nil. The graduation income and acceleration rate have the expected effects. The effect of the convergence rate is strongly scenario-dependent; some scenarios, perhaps unrealistically, assume strong technological convergence in the nopolicy case; in other scenarios, adopting 'best commercial technology in the whole world' would lead to substantial emission reduction.

Based on the assumption of the general availability of control technologies with equal technical properties and costs, a number of country-specific circumstances (level of technological advancement, installation size distribution, labor costs, etc.) are used to estimate the costs for the actual operation of pollution control equipment. \n \nFor the individual source sectors, emissions are estimated based on statistical information on economic activity and emission factors that reflect hypothetical emissions if no control measures were applied. These emission factors were taken from the literature and were, to the maximum possible extent, adapted to the country-specific conditions. Actual emissions are calculated taking into account the application of emission control measures in a given sector, for which also costs are estimated. \n \nThe methodology was implemented for all European countries, covering the period from 1990 to 2010. At an aggregated level, estimates for past years (1990, 1995) correspond well with other national and international inventories. However, discrepancies are found for some detailed results for individual sectors and activities, and more work will be necessary to clarify them. \n \nThis preliminary implementation suggests for Europe a 50 percent decline of primary emissions of fine particles between 1990 and 1995, mainly due to the economic restructuring in central and eastern European countries. The recently tightened regulations on large combustion plants and mobile sources will further reduce PM emissions, so that for 2010 European PM emissions are expected to be 60 percent below the level of 1990. However, less improvement is expected for the health-relevant fraction of fine particles (PM2.5). \n \nIt needs to be emphasized that these preliminary estimates are still associated with considerable uncertainties, and more work, involving national experts, will be necessary to obtain a verified and generally accepted European data base to estimate the potential for further reductions of fine particles in Europe. \n \nThe present implementation (version 2.00) of the RAINS PM module on the Internet (www.iiasa.ac.at/rains/Rains-online.html) provides free access to the input data and results to facilitate interaction with national experts.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "42d1fd2121695011335771927cdaf9747420a52a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2769617345", "DOI": "10.1023/A:1011104721510", "CorpusId": 7597063}, "title": "Benefits of a Reallocation of Nitrate Emission Reductions in the Rhine River Basin", "abstract": "In an attempt to improve ecological conditions of theRhine, emission reduction targets have been set fordifferent substances.

As the result of automakers' efforts to produce more efficient and lower-emission vehicles, lean-burn gasoline engines have been introduced into the market. While these engines are much more efficient than conventional ones, NOx removal has become significantly more difficult. After enormous efforts, we succeeded in solving the problem, by inventing a new class of catalyst. We overcame two strict problems with the new type catalyst, which are sulfur poisoning and thermal deterioration.We have improved the support type and reformed the steam and substrate qualities by clarifying the related degradation mechanisms.Here our challenges to develop a new catalyst to store and then reduce NOx are described. The catalyst has made it possible to make emissions of lean-burn engines meet strict NOx regulations.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "3365c7e1b8430422033e807eb31ef50d6700471d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2010743703", "DOI": "10.2514/1.6528", "CorpusId": 109346090}, "title": "Emissions Reduction Technologies for Military Gas Turbine Engines", "abstract": "Future military gas turbine engines will have higher performance than current engines, resulting in increased compressor and combustor exit temperatures, combustor pressures, and fuel-air ratios with wider operating limits. These combustor characteristics suggest undesirable exhaust emission levels of nitrogen oxides and smoke at maximum power and higher carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons at low power. To control emission levels while improving performance, durability and cost, requires major advances in combustor technology. Current emissions control approaches as applied to conventional swirl-stabilized combustors include rich- and lean-burn strategies, together with staged combustion. These approaches, even in fully developed form, may not be sufficient to satisfy the projected design requirements. Unconventional combustor configurations may become necessary. Different engine cycles other than the standard Brayton cycle may also be used for special applications in order to avoid the use of excessive combustion temperatures. The paper presents an overview of the currently utilized emissions control approaches, comparing their performances and likely potential for meeting future requirements. Experimental results are presented for two non-conventional combustor configurations that have shown promise for advanced engine applications. A brief discussion is offered on cycle changes that could result in lower peak temperatures while maintaining advanced performance.", "year": 2005}]}
