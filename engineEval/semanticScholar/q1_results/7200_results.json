Our paper belongs to the green supply chain management (GSCM) reviews but is distinguished by its specific interest in analysing research works on supply chain (SC) management regarding the reduction of carbon emissions and its related constraints. To facilitate our benchmarking of the 83 selected papers, we adopt a literature classification based on the logistic decisions studied within the developed models. We distinguish three categories of logistic decisions: operational management, technology investment and SC design coordination. Companies are currently facing great external pressures from governments and their conscientious customers to reduce their overall emissions. We analyse how these environmental constraints, which we believe are key drivers for low-carbon emissions management, have been incorporated into mathematical models. Analysing these external pressures in terms of concern about carbon emissions constitutes our main contribution through this literature review. In addition, companies are facing a challenge to reduce their carbon emissions, which are mainly generated from production, transport and storage activities. Consequently, the modelling of carbon emissions remains a crucial task when addressing the LCSCM problem. We suggest analysing the techniques used thus far to approximate those carbon emissions. Furthermore, to illustrate our literature classification and the features of the LCSCM problem, we provide the framework on which we based our analysis of the selected literature. We discuss the modelling aspects of this problem to highlight the limits of the existing literature and consequently suggest recommendations for future research. We believe that this issue will continue to be one of the top concerns of the OM community within the GSCM field as it continues to gain importance among business leaders, and political and social actors.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "d58d15f9538323e12ad0ed9493116ea4bb2b553c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2046785808", "DOI": "10.1108/09600031111166410", "CorpusId": 167728432}, "title": "Evaluating CO2 emissions and fatalities tradeoffs in truck transport", "abstract": "Purpose \u2013 The purpose of this paper is to model the tradeoffs among fatalities, CO2 emissions and value generated by the truck transportation portion of supply chains with the goal of determining if efforts to reduce CO2 emissions increase transportation\u2010related fatalities.Design/methodology/approach \u2013 The joint production of CO2, fatalities, and truck transport value in the 50 US states during 2002\u20102007 is modeled using data envelopment analysis.

We then jointly consider the electricity cost, service level agreement (SLA) requirement, and emission reduction budget.

When the emissions were expressed in terms of carbon dioxide-equivalents (CO2-e), pre-farm emissions comprised ~6% of the life cycle emissions, on-farm activities comprised ~36% and post-farm activities accounted for ~58% of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. We used one 400 g packet of corn chips as the functional unit. The single largest source of greenhouse emissions was the emission of nitrous oxide on the farm as a result of fertiliser application (0.126 kg CO2-e per packet). The next largest was electricity used during the manufacture of the corn chips (0.086 kg CO2-e per packet). The manufacture of the packaging (box plus packet, being 0.06 kg CO2-e) was the next largest source and then the oil for frying the corn chips (0.048 kg CO2-e per packet). Greenhouse gas emissions from fertiliser application were primarily nitrous oxide (N2O), which has a global warming potential of 310 kg CO2-e/kg N2O. In typical irrigated farm systems, these emissions, when converted to CO2-e, are almost three times more than the greenhouse gas emissions that result from energy used to pump water. However, pumping irrigation water from deep bores currently produces greenhouse gas emissions that are almost three times those from irrigation using surface waters. Greenhouse gas emissions from the use of tractors on typical farms are about one-third of the emissions from pumping water. Farm management techniques can be used to increase soil carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. If farms that currently burn stubble were to implement stubble incorporation then, in the absence of other changes to the supply chain, they will achieve a 30% reduction in emissions from \u2018cradle to farm-gate\u2019. In absolute terms, when the soil carbon dioxide is included (even though soil carbon dioxide in this instance is not counted as a greenhouse gas in national and international greenhouse gas inventories), our measurements indicate that carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions from farms that produce maize using stubble incorporation are 56% lower than emissions from farms that burn their stubble. The pre-farm and on-farm operations add $0.40 value per kg of CO2-e greenhouse gas emitted. Post-farm processing added $2 value per kg of CO2-e greenhouse gas emitted.

Post-1993 the CH4 growth rate has recovered to pre-1991 levels. In this study, we assess the sensitivity of the CH4 growth rate to changes in CH4 emissions from the coal and gas industries over the last 15 years using a global two-dimensional (2-D) model of the atmosphere. Emissions are estimated from available production data, and in the case of natural gas, a spectrum of leakage rates is assumed. Changes in the former Soviet Union (FSU) have been assessed separately from the rest of the world (ROW). Prior to 1989, increased coal and natural gas production led to an increase in the CH4 growth rate (i.e., opposite to that which was observed). During the period 1989 to 1993 the modelled CH4 growth rate decreased by \u223c1\u20132 ppbv yr\u22122 at northern mid-latitudes (assuming constant gas leakage rates), showing that declining emissions, primarily in the form of natural gas from the FSU, may have contributed to the general reduction in the CH4 growth rate from 1989 to 1991. However, this does not explain the large reduction which was observed between 1991 and 1992. A model run with FSU gas leakage rates decreasing by 1% yr\u22121 from 5% in 1990 to 2% in 1993 shows a decrease in the CH4 growth rate of \u223c9\u201312 ppbv yr\u22121 (or \u223c3\u20135 ppbv yr\u22122) over this period.

These changes have taken place during a period in which the primary gases and the wet deposition throughout Europe were extensively monitored. Since the end of the 1970s, for example land based sulphur emissions declined by between 90 and 70% depending on the region. Over the same period the total deposition of sulphur and its partitioning into wet and dry deposition have declined, but the spatial pattern in the reduction in deposition differs from that of emission and has changed with time. Such nonlinearities in the emission-deposition relationship are important to understand as they complicate the process of assessing the effects of emission reduction strategies. Observed non-linearities in terrestrial sulphur emission-deposition patterns have been identified in north west Europe due to increases in marine emissions, and are currently slowing the recovery of freshwater ecosystems. Changes in the relative amounts of SO2 and NH3 in air over the last two decades have also changed the affinity of terrestrial surfaces for SO2 and have therefore changed the deposition velocity of SO2 over substantial areas. The consequence of this effect has been the very rapid reduction in ambient SO2 concentration in some of the major source areas of Europe, where NH3 did not change much. Interactions between the different pollutants, generating non-linearities are now being incorporated in long-range transport models to simulate the effects of historical emission trends and to provide projections into the future.

We present different rules for allocating carbon allowances within sectors (lump-sum grandfathering, output-based allocation [OBA], and auctioning) and among sectors (historical emissions and value-added shares). Using a partial equilibrium model, we explore how OBA mitigates price increases, limits incentives for conservation in favor of lowering energy intensity, and changes relative output prices among sectors. We then use a computable general equilibrium model from the Global Trade Analysis Project, modified to incorporate a labor/leisure choice, to compare overall mechanism performance. The output subsidies implicit in OBA mitigate tax interactions, which can lead to higher welfare than grandfathering. OBA with sectoral distributions based on value added generates effective subsidies similar to a broad-based tax reduction, performing nearly like auctioning with revenue recycling, which generates the highest welfare. OBA based on historical emissions supports the output of more polluting industries, which more effectively counteracts carbon leakage but is more costly in welfare terms.

In contrast, improving grasslands with a single management activity enhanced SOC storage by 14% \u00b1 0.06 and 17% \u00b1 0.05 in temperate and tropical regions, respectively, and with an additional improvement(s), storage increased by another 11% \u00b1 0.04. We applied the newly derived factor coefficients to analyze C sequestration potential for managed grasslands in the U.S., and found that over a 20-year period changing management could sequester from 5 to 142 Tg C yr\u22121 or 0.1 to 0.9 Mg C ha\u22121 yr\u22121, depending on the level of change. This analysis provides revised factor coefficients for the IPCC method that can be used to estimate impacts of management; it also provides a methodological framework for countries to derive factor coefficients specific to conditions in their region.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "60c9e34083888c8571b76eebe991d1d772566314", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2580932946", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.inorgchem.6b02140", "CorpusId": 10603676, "PubMed": "28112918"}, "title": "Mechanisms of Li+ Ions in the Emission Enhancement of KMg4(PO4)3:Eu2+ for White Light Emitting Diodes.", "abstract": "Codoping with Li+ is a prevalent strategy to improve the optical efficiency of luminescent materials, while the mechanisms of enhancement are still ambiguous.

The Earth is expected to warm as a result, with consequences that are potentially highly disruptive to human societies. Reductions in the use of fossil fuels and in rates of deforestation worldwide will reduce emissions of CO2, but atmospheric concentrations will continue to increase unless emissions are reduced by more than 60% (about 4.5 billion tons of carbon annually). Reforestation seems to offer one of the few means for reducing the atmospheric concentration of CO2 over periods as short as human generations. We report here an approach for evaluating the potential for reforestation to help stabilize or even reduce the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere. Reforestation is defined broadly to include tree plantations, natural regrowth of secondary forests, and the practice of agroforestry. Our premise is that human use of the land has generally reduced woody biomass and that such lands have a potential for reaccumulating carbon if appropriately managed. We used published ground studies together with global vegetation index data from the NOAA 7 satellite to estimate current land cover in tropical regions. Then, superimposing this map of current land cover over maps depicting the distribution of vegetation cover prior to human disturbance, we obtained an estimate of about 3200 X 106 ha in the tropics (almost 60% of the total land area considered) where woody biomass had been decreased, and where carbon might again be sequestered. We calculated the amount of carbon that could be withdrawn from the atmosphere and stored in woody biomass if several management options were implemented. Biomass accumulations were determined from forestry statistics. Application of the data on biomass to the areas suitable for accumulation of carbon yielded an estimate of potential accumulation of 160-170 Pg carbon, an amount equivalent to the accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere since the start of the industrial revolution, or to about 25 years of fossil fuel emissions at current rates. Estimates of both area and potential accumulation of carbon were crude, probably not better than \u00b150%.

While there is growing interest in providing incentives to avoid deforestation and consequently reduce net carbon emissions, there is limited information available on the potential costs of these activities. This paper uses a global forestry and land use model to analyze the potential marginal costs of reducing net carbon emissions by avoiding deforestation in tropical countries.

These foregrounds come from a variety of sources (such as Galactic synchrotron emission and extragalactic point sources), but almost all share the property of being spectrally smooth, and when viewed through the chromatic response of an interferometer, occupy a signature \\wedge\" region in cylindrical k?kk Fourier space. The complement of the foreground wedge is termed the \\EoR window\", and is expected to be mostly foreground-free, allowing clean measurements of the power spectrum. This paper is a sequel to a previous paper that established a rigorous mathematical framework for describing the foreground wedge and the EoR window. Here, we use our framework to explore statistical methods by which the EoR window can be enlarged, thereby increasing the sensitivity of a power spectrum measurement. We adapt the Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock approximation (commonly used in galaxy surveys) for 21 cm cosmology, and also compare the optimal quadratic estimator to simpler estimators that ignore covariances between dierent Fourier modes. The optimal quadratic estimator is found to suppress foregrounds by an extra factor of 10 5 in power at the peripheries of the EoR window, boosting the detection of the cosmological signal from 12 to 50 at the midpoint of reionization in our ducial models. If numerical issues can be nessed, decorrelation techniques allow the EoR window to be further enlarged, enabling measurements to be made deep within the foreground wedge.

Drawing on the policy implementation literature and institutional theory, the authors develop a conceptual model of campaign-style enforcement in which both resource mobilization and power redistribution are theorized to address decoupling problems in regulatory compliance. The two-pathway recoupling mechanism is evidenced by an empirical investigation of the implementation of China's energy conservation and emission reduction policy as part of that country's 11th Five-Year Plan. Findings suggest that campaign-style enforcement can effectively improve regulatory compliance when it addresses the efficiency/legitimacy conflict by providing policy incentives and reorganizing a clear hierarchy of political authority.

Moreover, the panel nature of the data allows heterogeneity across countries to be controlled, so that comparisons can be made of how different national characteristics influence the environmental impact of freer trade. By testing the effects of democratic versus autocratic governance, it is found that while greater democracy can induce significant reductions in BOD emissions as openness increases, it may also lead to increased CO2 levels.

Wetland rice fields are an important source of methane, accounting for approximately 20% of the global anthropogenic methane emission. Methane fluxes from wetland rice fields in the Philippines were monitored with a closed chamber technique in close cooperation with the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI). The field studies were complemented by laboratory and greenhouse experiments. Up to 90 % of the methane emitted from a rice field may be transported from soil to atmosphere through the rice plant. It was shown that this plant-mediated transport is diffusion controlled. Methane emitted from a rice field is the net effect of methane production and methane oxidation. Methane oxidation in the rice rhizosphere depended on the growth stage of the rice plant and becomes of much less importance when the rice plant reaches the ripening stage. Maximum rhizospheric methane oxidation efficiency observed was about 30%, which is much lower than the 70-90% estimated from indirect measurements in previous studies. A higher percentage of oxygen in the air resulted in lower methane emission indicating that breeding rice cultivars that transport more oxygen to their rhizosphere may be a promising mitigation option. Field studies with several soil related factors that influence methane emission were conducted; salinity, sulfate availability, organic amendments and soil types. Organic amendments strongly stimulated methane emission. The impact of organic amendments on methane emission can be described by a dose-response curve. This approach proofed successful for data from various locations of the world. Salinity partly inhibited methane production but methane oxidation in the salt-amended plot was even more inhibited, indicating that a reduction in CH 4 production does not necessarily cause a proportional reduction in CH 4 emission. This illustrates the importance of both production and oxidation of methane when designing mitigation strategies to reduce methane emission. Different soil types had different methane emission levels. Wetland rice fields on saline, low-sulfate soils emit less methane than comparable non-saline rice fields. On soils high in sulfate or amended with large amounts of sulfate containing substances, methane emissions are reduced even more. Continuous monitoring of methane fluxes showed that upon soil drying considerable amounts of soil-entrapped methane may be released. In previous monitoring studies these periods were not included, which may cause an underestimation of, total seasonal emission by 10-15%.", "year": 1996}, {"paperId": "611b2dde7625c8532ffd5dc77fef392acc54db29", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2156208623", "DOI": "10.1002/chem.201001965", "CorpusId": 23191250, "PubMed": "20967907"}, "title": "Luminescent cyclometalated dialkynylgold(III) complexes of 2-phenylpyridine-type derivatives with readily tunable emission properties.", "abstract": "A novel class of luminescent dialkynylgold(III) complexes containing various phenylpyridine and phenylisoquinoline-type bidentate ligands has been successfully synthesized and characterized.

It is essential that decision-makers select an appropriate quantification methodology and have an appreciation of methodological strengths and shortcomings. This work compares four different waste emissions quantification methods, including Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 1996 guidelines, IPCC 2006 guidelines, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Waste Reduction Model (WARM), and the Federation of Canadian Municipalities- Partners for Climate Protection (FCM-PCP) quantification tool. Waste disposal data for the greater Toronto area (GTA) in 2005 are used for all methodologies; treatment options (including landfill, incineration, compost, and anaerobic digestion) are examined where available in methodologies. Landfill was shown to be the greatest source of GHG emissions, contributing more than three-quarters of total emissions associated with waste management. Results from the different landfill gas (LFG) quantification approaches ranged from an emissions source of 557 kt carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) (FCM-PCP) to a carbon sink of\u2009\u221253 kt CO2e (EPA WARM). Similar values were obtained between IPCC approaches. The IPCC 2006 method was found to be more appropriate for inventorying applications because it uses a waste-in-place (WIP) approach, rather than a methane commitment (MC) approach, despite perceived onerous data requirements for WIP. MC approaches were found to be useful from a planning standpoint; however, uncertainty associated with their projections of future parameter values limits their applicability for GHG inventorying. MC and WIP methods provided similar results in this case study; however, this is case specific because of similarity in assumptions of present and future landfill parameters and quantities of annual waste deposited in recent years being relatively consistent. IMPLICATIONS This paper provides insight for municipalities, consultants, and others involved in GHG quantification from waste management with regard to emissions from various treatment options and variation due to methodological selection. By examining the differences in emissions from the quantification tools and guidelines examined in this research, these professionals will gain insight on where shortcomings and methodological differences exist and how these may be addressed. It also provides an illustration of how theoretical yield gas calculations can be similar in magnitude to those calculated using a WIP approach.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "79696ed2179ea2ac4822a80d8fc90de75220242b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2070406366", "DOI": "10.1021/IE9801103", "CorpusId": 98712849}, "title": "Oxidation of Diesel-Generated Volatile Organic Compounds in the Selective Catalytic Reduction Process", "abstract": "The main part of the VOCs (volatile organic compounds) contained in diesel exhaust (\u224880%) is oxidized to CO and CO2 over an SCR (selective catalytic reduction) catalyst.

The factors were analysed to determine their role in efforts to establish comprehensive REDD+ policies that target transformational change. The results reveal path dependencies and institutional stickiness in all the study countries.

This economic case study shows a cost prediction for conversion of all the CO2 from the cement industry into methane by using the technologies available today in order to replacing fossil methane imports.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "ef9737238cfd0ba8fc38b16104d8e07486b0b64c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2058369933", "DOI": "10.1111/J.1477-8947.2008.00176.X", "CorpusId": 54909606}, "title": "Forestry-based carbon sequestration projects in Africa: Potential benefits and challenges", "abstract": "Carbon sequestration through forestry and agroforestry can help mitigate global warming. For Africa, carbon sequestration also represents an opportunity to fund sustainable development through financial inflows. However, with a low share of global carbon trade, there are strong concerns that African countries are losing out on this valuable opportunity. Through a comprehensive review of 23 carbon sequestration projects across 14 countries, this paper discusses ways to overcome critical challenges to scale up carbon investments in Africa. These projects are expected to sequester 26.85 million tCO2 beyond the baseline situation. Within the continent, East Africa is the preferred destination for carbon investors. Most projects are non-Kyoto compliant and represent voluntary emission reductions. While project benefits such as increased local incomes and improved natural resources are promising, there are concerns that conversion of grasslands into tree plantations can harm local ecosystems. Insecure land tenure constrains new investments and increases the risk that local communities will lose access to forests. Another challenge is that projects with smallholders have high transaction costs. These costs can be overcome by building strong community institutions and simplifying project guidelines.

Therefore, this paper uses the Kuznets curve to probe the relationship between economic growth, solar energy technology, and carbon emissions.

In the long-run, the relationship between economic growth and carbon emissions is inverted \u201cU,\u201d which suggest that there is a turning point of carbon emissions, where the carbon emissions first increase with economic growth and then gradually decrease, which is reflected in the image as an inverted \u201cU\u201d curve.

Though the tailpipe NOx and particulate matter emissions have been reduced to a large extent by the applications of after-treatment systems such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems and Diesel particulate filters, engine fuel economy usually needs to be compromised considerably to achieve appropriate engine-out emissions. Most of the current Diesel engine control studies focus only on the Diesel engines themselves, while most of the current aftertreatment controls are limited in the scope of aftertreatment systems alone. The opportunities of further improving the overall powertrain system performance by considering the engine and aftertreatment system in an integrative way have been rarely exploited. In this paper, a new framework for integrated control of both engine and aftertreatment system is devised. A backstepping-based active NOx control method is proposed by treating the engine-out NOx concentration as a control input for the ammonia coverage ratio control of a two-cell SCR system.

Nevertheless, the scope and the variety of potential electrophiles is limited due to the harsh reaction conditions requested for a covalent attachment of the functional entities onto the SWCNT framework.

Moreover, these carbonyl-based electrophiles can also be used as secondary functionalization reagents for anionic SWCNT intermediates, derived from a primary nucleophilic addition step. This directly leads to the generation of mixed functional SWCNT architectures, equipped with hydroxyl or carbonyl anchor groups, suitable for ongoing derivatization reactions. A correlated absorption and emission spectroscopic study elucidates the influence of the covalent sidewall functionalization degree onto the excitonic transition features of carbon nanotubes.

The national inventory reports play an important role, but do not reflect specifics of regional processes of GHG emission and absorption for large-area countries. In this article, a GIS approach for the spatial inventory of GHG emissions in the energy sector, based on IPCC guidelines, official statistics on fuel consumption, and digital maps of the region under investigation, is presented. We include mathematical background for the spatial emission inventory of point, line and area sources, caused by fossil-fuel use for power and heat production, the residential sector, industrial and agricultural sectors, and transport. Methods for the spatial estimation of emissions from stationary and mobile sources, taking into account the specifics of fuel used and technological processes, are described. Using the developed GIS technology, the territorial distribution of GHG emissions, at the level of elementary grid cells 2 km\u2009\u00d7\u20092 km for the territory of Western Ukraine, is obtained. Results of the spatial analysis are presented in the form of a geo-referenced database of emissions, and visualized as layers of digital maps. Uncertainty of inventory results is calculated using the Monte Carlo approach, and the sensitivity analysis results are described. The results achieved demonstrated that the relative uncertainties of emission estimates, for CO2 and for total emissions (in CO2 equivalent), depend largely on uncertainty in the statistical data and on uncertainty in fuels\u2019 calorific values. The uncertainty of total emissions stays almost constant with the change of uncertainty of N2O emission coefficients, and correlates strongly with an improvement in knowledge about CH4 emission processes. The presented approach provides an opportunity to create a spatial cadastre of emissions, and to use this additional knowledge for the analysis and reduction of uncertainty. It enables us to identify territories with the highest emissions, and estimate an influence of uncertainty of the large emission sources on the uncertainty of total emissions. Ascribing emissions to the places where they actually occur helps to improve the inventory process and to reduce the overall uncertainty.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "8ae3df11a1741bd52cc76f4b41216ebd0e041dc7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1561197904", "DOI": "10.4271/2003-32-0007", "CorpusId": 109788922}, "title": "Optimization of the E-TEC\u2122 Combustion System for Direct-Injected Two-Stroke Engines Toward 3-Star Emissions", "abstract": "This paper describes important aspects of the development process for meeting CARB's \"Ultra-Low\" 3-Star emissions with engines using the new E-TEC direct injection system. In-house research and analysis of data from otherstate-of the-art engines were used to determine achievable emission levels and to set the development targets. A detailed mode-point-specific analysis of the emissions potential of the FIGHT\u00ae direct injection system revealed excellent system capability in homogeneous operation and limited potential for stratified operation. Based on these results, the development work was focused on the reduction of stratified hydrocarbon emissions. Wall impingement of the fuel spray onto the piston surface was identified as a major source of hydrocarbon emissions during stratified operation. A zero-dimensional simulation of various parameters affecting wall impingement indicates that droplet size, in-cylinder temperature, and penetration velocity are the three major factors. Droplet size was reduced drastically through the use of the new E-TEC voice-coil injectors with newly developed outwardly opening swirl nozzles. The in-cylinder temperature is increased with optimized air-flow and engine temperature management. The management of the fuel spray wall impingement was improved significantly by optimizing the splash bowl geometry in the piston surface. KIVA spray simulations with different cylinder head geometries indicate that the design of the near nozzle area and especially the distance of the cylinder wall from the fuel spray are critical for optimal fuel spray development and mixture preparation. The near nozzle geometry was also found to have an effect on penetration velocity. An optimized combustion chamber location that maximizes the distance of the fuel spray from the walls reduced stratified emissions by up to 40% and resulted in an ICOMIA cycle emissions reduction of 18%. The combination of the new E-TEC direct injection system with an optimized combustion chamber and improvements in near-nozzle geometry, injector targeting, piston splash bowl design, air-flow management, and mapping resulted in an overall emissions reduction of over 50% compared to the FIGHT\u00ae direct injection system.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "57bd74a97b350caad15443468962d80dcb47cb1b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2182618796", "CorpusId": 96477704}, "title": "A Re-examination of the NBI LEED Building Energy Consumption Study", "abstract": "A recent study by the New Buildings Institute looked at the energy performance of 121 LEED certified commercial buildings and concluded they were saving 25-30% energy relative to conventional buildings. Here we identify several critical flaws in the NBI analysis and, upon reexamination of the data, reach different conclusions. We find that the average energy consumption by LEED certified buildings is actually higher than the corresponding average for the US commercial building stock. This difference is shown to be largely due to the over-representation of \u201chigh-energy\u201d principle building activities (PBA\u2019s) such as laboratories and the under-representation of \u201clow-energy\u201d PBA\u2019s such as non-refrigerated warehouses in the LEED building data set, relative to their occurrence in the U.S. commercial building stock. Eliminating high- and low-energy PBA\u2019s from both data sets yields \u201cmedium-energy\u201d building subsets free of these disparities. Comparing these we find that LEED medium energy buildings, on average, use 10% less site energy but no less source (or primary energy) than do comparable conventional buildings. LEED office buildings achieve 17% reduction in site energy, but again, no significant reduction in primary energy use relative to non-LEED office buildings. We further find that these results do not change significantly if LEED buildings are compared with newer vintage, non-LEED buildings. As green house gas (GHG) emission correlates with primary energy, not site energy, we conclude that LEED certification is not yielding any significant reduction in GHG emission by commercial buildings.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "c8662537fbceab78b1e2bac7e1758291cd631a87", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2042564490", "DOI": "10.1021/CM403518A", "CorpusId": 95159493}, "title": "\u201cFlash\u201d Synthesis of CdSe/CdS Core\u2013Shell Quantum Dots", "abstract": "We report on the \u201cflash\u201d synthesis of CdSe/CdS core\u2013shell quantum dots (QDs).

The prepared materials present state-of-the-art properties with narrow emission and high photoluminescence quantum yields, even for thick CdS shells.
