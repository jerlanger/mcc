Under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), member countries are allocated national emission quotas which they further distribute among their individual industry sectors. Within the UK, the electricity generation industry already plays a significant role in the reduction of green house emissions. Emissions trading mechanisms should make it more attractive to build capacity in renewable and cleaner generation than buying rights to emit since more still needs to be done to reduce emissions. To achieve this it is essential that the right emission quotas are allocated for different industries. The amount of emissions to be allocated to the generation industry must therefore be consistent with the desired emissions reduction target and the current technological status of the generation mix. The allocation must also take into account the relative costs of cleaner and renewable generation technologies that are commercially available and those in developments. This paper proposes an approach for determining the emissions allocation for the generation industry to achieve a given emission reduction target. The paper draws on previous work on valuing emissions from electricity generation and building a sustainable generation mix in a competitive environment. Studies were carried out with seven generation technologies. The studies demonstrate that when compared with energy markets alone, emission trading schemes have significant influence in future generation mix and its consequential technology and generation costs as well as emission reductions. Appropriate emission allocation scheme encourages a cost-effective, sustainable generation mix to develop without distorting competition.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "f1c5c68468a9662a2a83ff01d72ce884afd777e9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2157304707", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-12-2615-2012", "CorpusId": 56053890}, "title": "Projected change in atmospheric nitrogen deposition to the Baltic Sea towards 2020", "abstract": "Abstract. The ecological status of the Baltic Sea has for many years been affected by the high input of both waterborne and airborne nutrients. The focus here is on the airborne input of nitrogen (N) and the projected changes in this input, assuming the new National Emission Ceilings directive (NEC-II), currently under negotiation in the EU, is fulfilled towards the year 2020. With a set of scenario simulations, the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) has been used to estimate the development in nitrogen deposition based on present day meteorology combined with present day (2007) or future (2020) anthropogenic emissions. Applying a so-called tagging method in the DEHM model, the contribution from ship traffic and from each of the nine countries with coastlines to the Baltic Sea has been assessed. The annual deposition to the Baltic Sea is estimated to 203 k tonnes N for the present day scenario (2007) and 165 k tonnes N in the 2020 scenario, giving a projected reduction of 38 k tonnes N in the annual load in 2020. This equals a decline in nitrogen deposition of 19%. The results from 20 model runs using the tagging method show that of the total nitrogen deposition in 2007, 52% came from emissions within the bordering countries. By 2020, this is projected to decrease to 48%. For some countries the projected decrease in nitrogen deposition arising from the implementation of the NEC-II directive will contribute significantly to compliance with the reductions agreed on in the provisional reduction targets of the Baltic Sea Action Plan. This underlines the importance of including projections like the current in future updates of the Baltic Sea Action Plan.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "ec88aac6b81d434285ee97fe4408b91d1cae9e81", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2053450910", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-010-9984-5", "CorpusId": 154640765}, "title": "Systematic under- and overestimation of GHG reductions in renewable biomass systems", "abstract": "This paper identifies a critical systematic error in greenhouse gas accounting in renewable biomass systems.

Antimony concentrations ranged from 0.07 to 108 pg g(-1) with a median of 0.98 pg g(-1)(N= 510). Scandium, used as a conservative reference element, revealed that dust inputs were effectively constant during the last 160 years. The atmospheric Sb signal preserved in the ice core reflects contamination from industrialisation, the economic boom which followed WWII, as well as the comparatively recent introduction of flue gas filter technologies and emission reduction efforts. Natural contributions to the total Sb inventory are negligible, meaning that anthropogenic emissions have dominated atmospheric Sb deposition throughout the entire period. The seasonal resolution of the snow pit showed that aerosols deposited during the Arctic winter, when air masses are derived mainly from Eurasia, show the greatest Sb concentrations. Deposition during summer, when air masses come mainly from North America, is still enriched in Sb, but less so. Snow and ice provide unambiguous evidence that enrichments of Sb in Arctic air have increased 50% during the past three decades, with two-thirds being deposited during winter. Most Sb is produced in Asia, primarily from Sb sulfides such as stibnite (Sb2S3), but also as a by-product of lead and copper smelting. In addition there is a growing worldwide use of Sb in automobile brake pads, plastics and flame retardants. In contrast to Pb which has gone into decline during the same interval because of the gradual elimination of gasoline lead additives, the enrichments of Sb have been increasing and today clearly exceed those of Pb. Given that the toxicity of Sb is comparable to that of Pb, Sb has now replaced Pb in the rank of potentially toxic trace metals in the Arctic atmosphere.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "659712c6169ff35c152c9b81e918154ac78098fc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2091562415", "DOI": "10.1103/PHYSREVB.68.045205", "CorpusId": 123299088}, "title": "Blue emission band in compensated GaN:Mg codoped with Si", "abstract": "Codoping of p-type GaN with Mg and Si was investigated to determine its effect on deep level luminescence.

Those parameters include density, surface tension, viscosity and the viscosity index. Dimensions of drops of biofuels are much bigger compared to hydrocarbon fuels. By modifying the physical and chemical parameters of biofuels, dimensions of drops in an atomised fuel stream should become smaller. Those dimensions play a major role for the level of emissions of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide, as well as mainly nitrogen oxides and particulates. The research on emissions of toxic components of fuel is relatively advanced today in the field of piston combustion engines, especially for use in car vehicles. However, the dynamic development of the air transport brings more pressure on the issue of toxic emissions in the case of aircraft engines. The level of toxic emissions from aircraft engines may be from ten up to even several thousand times greater than the level of emissions from piston engines. The issue of how biofuel additives can affect the process of fuel atomisation and thus enable the control over the atomisation to obtain the smallest possible drops leading to reduced nitrogen oxides emissions is a new and original issue.

We used a probabilistic framework of wildfire occurrence to (1) estimate the potential for fuel treatments to reduce fire risk and hazard across the landscape and within protected California spotted owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) habitat and (2) evaluate the consequences of treatments with respect to terrestrial C stocks and burning emissions. Silvicultural and prescribed fire treatments were simulated on 20% of a northern Sierra Nevada landscape in three treatment scenarios that varied in the land area eligible for treatment. Treatment prescriptions varied with topography, vegetation characteristics, and ownership. We then simulated many wildfires in the treated and untreated landscapes. Additional simulations allowed us to consider the influence of wildfire size on estimated emissions. Treatments constrained to the land area outside of spotted owl activity centers reduced the probability of burning and potential fire intensity within owl habitat and across the landscape relative to no-treatment scenarios. Allowing treatment of the activity centers achieved even greater fire hazard reductions within the activity centers. Treatments also reduced estimated wildfire emissions of C by 45\u201361%. However, emissions from prescribed burning exceeded simulated reductions in wildfire emissions. Consequently, all treatment scenarios resulted in higher C emissions than the no-treatment scenarios. Further, for wildfires of moderate size (714\u20132133\u00a0ha), the treatment scenarios reduced the C contained in live tree biomass following simulated wildfire. When large wildfires (8070\u201310,757\u00a0ha) were simulated, however, the treatment scenario retained more live tree C than the no-treatment scenario. Our approach, which estimated terrestrial C immediately following wildfire, did not account for long-term C dynamics, such as emissions associated with post-wildfire decay, C sequestration by future forest growth, or longer-term C sequestration in structural wood products.

The main source of MeHg exposure is seafood consumption, including many marine species harvested from the global oceans. Fish, birds and other wildlife are also susceptible to the impacts of MeHg and already exceed toxicological thresholds in vulnerable regions like the Arctic. Most future emissions scenarios project a growth or stabilization of anthropogenic mercury releases relative to present-day levels. At these emissions levels, inputs of mercury to ecosystems are expected to increase substantially in the future, in part due to growth in the legacy reservoirs of mercury in oceanic and terrestrial ecosystems. Seawater mercury concentration trajectories in areas such as the North Pacific Ocean that supply large quantities of marine fish to the global seafood market are projected to increase by more than 50% by 2050. Fish mercury levels and subsequent human and biological exposures are likely to also increase because production of MeHg in ocean ecosystems is driven by the supply of available inorganic mercury, among other factors. Analyses that only consider changes in primary anthropogenic emissions are likely to underestimate the severity of future deposition and concentration increases associated with growth in mercury reservoirs in the land and ocean. We therefore recommend that future policy analyses consider the fully coupled interactions among short and long-lived reservoirs of mercury in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial ecosystems. Aggressive anthropogenic emission reductions are needed to reduce MeHg exposures and associated health impacts on humans and wildlife and protect the integrity of one of the last wild-food sources globally.

Need for surgery was considered essential, and therefore traditional open surgery was used as the comparator. Scope 1 (direct) CO(2) emissions resulting from CO(2) gas used for insufflation were based on both escaping procedural CO(2) and metabolic CO(2) eliminated via respiration. Scopes 2 and 3 (indirect) emissions related to capture, compression, and transportation of CO(2) to hospitals and the disposal of single-use equipment not used in open surgery were calculated.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe total CO(2) emissions were calculated to be 355,924 tonnes/year. For perspective, if MIS in the United States was considered a country, it would rank 189 th on the United Nations 2008 list of countries' carbon emissions per year. Limitations include the inability to account for uncertainty using the various models and tools for approximating CO(2) emissions.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nCO(2) emission of MIS in the United States may have a significant environmental impact.

As a result of the heavy reliance on coal for electricity generation, emissions of air pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), are increasing. To address these growing emissions, the Ministry of Environmental Protection (MEP) has introduced new NOx emission control policies to encourage the installation of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technologies on a large number of coalfired electric power plants. There is, however, limited experience with SCR in China. It is therefore useful to explore the lessons from the use of SCR technologies in other countries. This paper provides an overview of SCR technology performance at coal-fired electric power plants demonstrating emission removal rates between 65% and 92%. It also reviews the design and operational challenges that, if not addressed, can reduce the reliability, performance, and cost-effectiveness of SCR technologies. These challenges include heterogeneous flue gas conditions, catalyst degradation, ammonia slip, sulfur trioxide (SO3) formation, and fouling and corrosion of plant equipment. As China and the rest of the world work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from parasitic load and urea-to-ammonia conversion may also become more important. If these challenges are properly addressed, SCR can reliably and effectively remove up to 90% of NOx emissions at coal-fired power plants.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "3e2a8fca50c33859cef75a877e045ea593651906", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2896543034", "DOI": "10.1007/S00231-018-2509-X", "CorpusId": 126364669}, "title": "Performance, emission and combustion study on neat biodiesel and water blends fuelled research diesel engine", "abstract": "This work investigates the experimental study to examine the operation characteristics of an orange peel oil biodiesel (BD100) along with water as an oxygenated additive in various volume fractions.

They can react with natural or man-made volatile organic compounds to produce smog, or else can be further oxidized to produce particulate haze, or acid rain that can eutrophy land and water. The reactive nitrogen that begins in the energy sector thus cascades through the atmosphere, the hydrosphere and soils before being eventually partially denitrifed to the global warming and stratospheric ozone-depleting gas nitrous oxide or molecular nitrogen. This paper will suggest how an economic analysis of the nitrogen cycle can identify the most cost-effective places to intervene. Nitrogen oxides released during fossil-fuel combustion in vehicles, power plants and heating boilers can either be controlled by add-on emission control technology, or can be eliminated by many of the same technical options that lead to carbon dioxide reduction. These integrated strategies also address sustainability, economic development and national security issues. Similarly in industrial production, it is more effective to focus on redesigning industrial processes rather than on nitrogen oxide pollution elimination from the current system.

Mixing ratios of Hg\u00b0 at TF showed distinct seasonality with maxima in March and minima in October. Hg\u00b0 at AI tracked the trend at TF but with higher minima, while at PM the diurnal and annual cycles were dampened. In winter, Hg\u00b0 was correlated most strongly with CO and NO y , indicative of anthropogenic emissions as their primary source. Our analysis indicates that Hg\u00b0 had a regional background level of ~160 fmol/mol in winter, a dry deposition velocity of ~0.20 cm s \u22121 with a ~16 day lifetime in the coastal boundary layer in summer. The influence of oceanic emissions on ambient Hg\u00b0 levels was identified using the Hg\u00b0-CHBr 3 correlation at both TF and AI.

Large interannual variability in warm season Hg\u00b0 levels in 2004 versus 2005/2006 may be due to the role of precipitation patterns in influencing surface evasion of Hg\u00b0.

These trends could be explained by a homogeneous distribution of Hg\u00b0 over North American in winter due to its long lifetime and/or rapid removal of reactive mercury from anthropogenic sources.

The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate whether positron emission tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) allows for a more accurate evaluation of histopathologic response. Experimental Design: From January 2005 to January 2007, 42 patients with resectable biopsy-proven high-grade soft-tissue sarcoma underwent a FDG-PET/computed tomography scan before and after neoadjuvant treatment. Relative changes in tumor FDG uptake and size from the baseline to the follow-up scan were calculated, and their accuracy for assessment of histopathologic response was compared by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Histopathologic response was defined as \u226595% tumor necrosis. Results: In histopathologic responders (n = 8; 19%), reduction in tumor FDG uptake was significantly greater than in nonresponders (P < 0.001), whereas no significant differences were found for tumor size (P = 0.24). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for metabolic changes was 0.93, but only 0.60 for size changes (P = 0.004). Using a 60% decrease in tumor FDG uptake as a threshold resulted in a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 71% for assessment of histopathologic response, whereas Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors showed a sensitivity of 25% and a specificity of 100%.

According to these results, mobile sources of Bogota annually emit: 4,800,000 tons of CO2; 450,000 tons of CO; 30,000 tons of NOx; 60,000 tons of THC and 1,100 tons of PM2.5. For CO, THC and NOx, vehicles equipped with tree-way catalysts exhibited much lower emissions than those lacking such a technology. In gener- al, vehicles with larger engines exhibited higher emissions than those vehicles with smaller engines. Additional measurements were performed on dual vehicles (gasoline - natural gas). These results suggest there is no envi- ronmental benefit in regards of the reduction of pollutant emissions, when a vehicle is transformed from gasoline to natural gas. In addition, tests were developed to asses PM emissions reduction while vehicles powered with conven- tional ACPM and then with low sulfur ACPM.

The model was developed as a minimum cost diet model. Two types of environmental policies were examined: a tax and a constraint on methane emissions. A tax was incorporated to simulate a greenhouse gas emissions tax policy, and prices of carbon credits in the current carbon markets were attributed to the methane production variable. Three independent runs were made, using carbon dioxide equivalent prices of $5, $17, and $250/t. A constraint was incorporated into the model to simulate the second type of environmental policy, reducing methane emissions by predetermined amounts. The linear programming formulation of this second alternative enabled the calculation of marginal costs of reducing methane emissions. Methane emission and manure production by dairy cows were calculated according to published equations, and nitrogen and mineral excretions were calculated by mass conservation laws. Results were compared with respect to the values generated by a base least-cost model. Current prices of the carbon credit market did not appear onerous enough to have a substantive incentive effect in reducing methane emissions and altering diet costs of our hypothetical dairy herd. However, when emissions of methane were assumed to be reduced by 5, 10, and 13.5% from the base model, total diet costs increased by 5, 19.1, and 48.5%, respectively. Either these increased costs would be passed onto the consumer or dairy producers would go out of business. Nitrogen and potassium excretions were increased by 16.5 and 16.7% with a 13.5% reduction in methane emissions from the base model. Imposing methane restrictions would further increase the demand for grains and other human-edible crops, which is not a progressive solution for an industry trying to be sustainable. However, these results might depend on the constraints and inputs used in our model (e.g., feed prices), and more extensive analyses are required before they are used in policy development. The model structure was able to incorporate effects of environmental policies in diet formulation and it can assist dairy producers in meeting limits set by these policies.

These guidelines also require assessment of the model simulation against observations. In this study, we examined the link between the simulated relative responses to emission reductions and model performance as measured by operational evaluation metrics, a part of the model evaluation required by the guidance, which often is the cornerstone of model evaluation in many practical applications. To this end, summertime O3 concentrations were simulated with two modeling systems for both 2002 and 2009 emission conditions. One of these two modeling systems was applied with two different parameterizations for vertical mixing. Comparison of the simulated base-case 8-hr daily maximum O3 concentrations showed marked model-to-model differences of up to 20 ppb, resulting in significant differences in operational model performance measures. In contrast, only relatively minor differences were detected in the relative response of O3 concentrations to emission reductions, resulting in differences of a few ppb or less in estimated future year design values. These findings imply that operational model evaluation metrics provide little insight into the reliability of the actual model application in the regulatory setting (i.e., the estimation of relative changes). In agreement with the guidance, it is argued that more emphasis should be placed on the diagnostic evaluation of O3-precursor relationships and on the development and application of dynamic and retrospective evaluation approaches in which the response of the model to changes in meteorology and emissions is compared with observed changes. As an example, simulated relative O3 changes between 1995 and 2007 are compared against observed changes. It is suggested that such retrospective studies can serve as the starting point for targeted diagnostic studies in which individual aspects of the modeling system are evaluated and refined to improve the characterization of observed changes.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "87db0eed0ebb4990a32ee05eb5dc830ee57fe387", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2017953351", "DOI": "10.1179/026708300101507550", "CorpusId": 137433527}, "title": "Evaluation of induction hardened case depth through microstructural characterisation using magnetic Barkhausen emission technique", "abstract": "Abstract The influence on the hysteresis loop and the magnetic Barkhausen emission (MBE) of microstructure within the case of different induction hardened carbon steel shafts has been studied. The hysteresis loop shows a distortion with a sudden reduction in the rate of magnetisation (dB/dH ) before approaching the maximum magnetic flux density indicating surface hardening. The systematic changes in the MBE profile for different voltages applied during induction heating indicate the microstructural variations within the case. A single peak MBE profile for a fully martensitic structure gradually changes into two peaks on reducing the induction hardening voltage indicating the formation of an additional soft ferrite phase within the case. The systematic changes in the two MBE peak heights indicate the synergistic decrease in the volume fraction of martensite and the increase in the volume fraction of ferrite phase within the case due to reduction in the induction hardening voltage. The changes in the MBE profile for different case depth specimens are more prominent than the hysteresis loop. This study shows that the MBE alone gives better insight in evaluating the induction hardened components (having case depth \u22721\u00b75 mm), since the height and position of the two MBE peaks are directly influenced by the volume fraction and composition of hard and soft phases within the case.

Thus it has been a major, but contentious topic in the climate negotiations to allow crediting of emissions reduction in developing countries towards domestic emission targets of industrial countries. The Kyoto Protocol instituted a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) that is to assure that the interests of all parties from industrialized and developing countries are equally represented. Many issues concerning the structure of the CDM remain to be decided. Crediting critically depends on these decisions. Credits should accrue only after verification. A crucial issue that influences all decisions on creation and distribution of credits is whether they are tradable. Concerning credit creation, it would be advisable not to set quotas on the share of CDM credited toward Annex-B targets as they give no dynamic incentive for innovation. To reach the latter goal, crediting should be gradually reduced in the long run. Crediting should also be related to externalities and thus be differentiated according to project categories. In a fund model, the reduction of credits could be evenly spread over all investors. In a clearinghouse model it would have to be related to each project. Uncertainties should not be covered through discounting but through a compulsory insurance. Credit sharing leads to higher costs for the investors and a lower demand for CDM projects. Free negotiation of the credit sharing ratio will lead to a competition between host countries. In case of tradability, host countries could set up projects with own funds to earn credits they can sell. Such a de facto extension of emissions trading could work against the goal of inducing developing countries to voluntarily adopt emission targets. This could be promoted by making credits non-tradable but allowing banking against future targets.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "d2c281293d4734372a1b825571c79a27dd061866", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2972433954", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1904378116", "CorpusId": 202405716, "PubMed": "31501321"}, "title": "Decadal increase in Arctic dimethylsulfide emission", "abstract": "Significance As Arctic sea-ice cover declines because of climate warming, the emission of reactive gases produced by marine microbes increases. One of such gases, dimethylsulfide, forms new atmospheric particles that contribute to cloud formation. This can either cool the Earth\u2019s surface by reflecting incoming sunlight, or warm it due to the blanket effect. Here we quantify Arctic Ocean dimethylsulfide emission between 1998 and 2016 using satellite observations of microalgal biomass and physical variables. We report an increasing trend, driven by sea-ice loss, and substantial year-to-year variability modulated by biological productivity. Our results can help understand the impacts and feedbacks of marine plankton on Arctic climate and foresee their future trajectories under the pressure of global change. Dimethylsulfide (DMS), a gas produced by marine microbial food webs, promotes aerosol formation in pristine atmospheres, altering cloud radiative forcing and precipitation. Recent studies suggest that DMS controls aerosol formation in the summertime Arctic atmosphere and call for an assessment of pan-Arctic DMS emission (EDMS) in a context of dramatic ecosystem changes. Using a remote sensing algorithm, we show that summertime EDMS from ice-free waters increased at a mean rate of 13.3 \u00b1 6.7 Gg S decade\u22121 (\u223c33% decade\u22121) north of 70\u00b0N between 1998 and 2016. This trend, mostly explained by the reduction in sea-ice extent, is consistent with independent atmospheric measurements showing an increasing trend of methane sulfonic acid, a DMS oxidation product. Extrapolation to an ice-free Arctic summer could imply a 2.4-fold (\u00b11.2) increase in EDMS compared to present emission. However, unexpected regime shifts in Arctic geo- and ecosystems could result in future EDMS departure from the predicted range. Superimposed on the positive trend, EDMS shows substantial interannual changes and nonmonotonic multiyear trends, reflecting the interplay between physical forcing, ice retreat patterns, and phytoplankton productivity.

In this context, disentangling of negative and depressive symptoms is of the utmost importance when understanding specific rTMS effects on schizophrenic symptoms. Method. Using a sham-controlled parallel design, 20 patients with schizophrenia were included in the study. Patients were treated with high-frequency 10 Hz rTMS over 10 days. Besides clinical ratings, ECD-SPECT (technetium-99 bicisate single photon emission computed tomography) imaging was performed before and after termination of rTMS treatment. Results. High-frequency rTMS leads to a significant reduction of negative symptoms combined with a trend for non-significant improvement of depressive symptoms in the active stimulated group as compared with the sham stimulated group. Additionally, a trend for worsening of positive symptoms was observed in the actively treated schizophrenic patients. In both groups no changes in regional cerebral blood flow could be detected by ECD-SPECT. Conclusions.

In Exp. 2, four rumen-fistulated steers (48 +/- 1 mo old) were assigned to 1 of 4 dietary concentrations of MA (0%, MA-0; 2.5%, MA-2.5; 5.0%, MA-5.0; or 7.5%, MA-7.5) on a DMI basis, over 4 periods. Both experimental diets consisted of grass silage and pelleted concentrate (containing MA). Silage was fed ad libitum once daily (a.m.), whereas concentrate was fed twice daily (a.m. and p.m.) with the aim of achieving a total DMI of 40:60 silage:concentrate. In both Exp. 1 and 2, experimental periods consisted of 28 d, incorporating a 13-d acclimatization, a 5-d measurement period, and a 10-d washout period. In Exp. 1, enteric CH(4), feed apparent digestibility, and feed intake were measured over the 5-d measurement period.

Rumen pH was determined and samples were taken for protozoa count, VFA, and ammonia analysis. Enteric CH(4) emissions were estimated by using the sulfur hexafluoride tracer technique and feed apparent digestibility was estimated by using chromic oxide as an external marker for fecal output. In Exp. 1, increasing dietary MA led to a linear decrease in total DMI (P < 0.001) and total daily CH(4) emissions (P < 0.001). Compared with the control diet, the greatest concentration of MA decreased total daily CH(4) emissions by 16%, which corresponded to a 9% reduction per unit of DMI. Similarly, in Exp. 2, inclusion of MA reduced DMI in a linear (P = 0.002) and quadratic (P < 0.001) fashion. Increasing dietary MA led to a linear decrease in molar proportion of acetic (P = 0.004) and butyric acids (P < 0.001) and an increase in propionic acid (P < 0.001). Ruminal pH tended to increase (P = 0.10) with increasing dietary MA. Dietary inclusion of MA led to a linear (P = 0.01) decrease in protozoa numbers.

There is a consensus that diversification of cropping would support sustainable development. However, a reduction in legume cultivation has been observed in the EU during the last decades. This decline has induced, in turn, a deficit of proteins and a reduction of ecosystem services provided by legumes. Therefore, we analysed the mechanisms that shape agricultural systems to identify leverage points for reviving European legume production. Specifically, we reviewed the factors that affect the market and non-market value of legumes and the relevant agricultural policies. We characterized the decline in legume cropping as an outcome of the dominance of economic forces that favour specialization of production systems over diversification. We found that the value of market outputs of legumes per unit area is relatively low and volatile, with a 25\u201378\u00a0% variation in pea gross margins, which reduces market competitiveness. We observed that the value of system-internal outputs of legumes such as the nitrogen fixed, of 130 to 153\u00a0kg\u00a0N\u00a0ha\u22121; crop protection services that reduce agrochemical costs, by 20\u201325\u00a0% in cereals; and yield enhancements of subsequent crops, of 0.2 to 1.6\u00a0t\u00a0ha\u22121 in cereals, are often underestimated. In addition, markets fail to translate external effects of legumes such as biodiversity enhancement, reduction in emissions, of up to 50\u00a0% in N2O, and soil improvements into economic benefits. Current policies support legumes through selected mechanisms such as ecological focus areas, agri-environmental programmes and sparse coupled support measures. Domestic cultivation of legumes could be supported through trade policies such as import restrictions on genetically modified soybean or new mechanisms to appreciate non-market outputs including payments for ecosystem services and carbon markets.

REDD design options are analyzed with regard to their implications for overall climate change mitigation, biodiversity conservation and equity issues. \nFirst of all, it is found that for REDD to be successful it will not be sufficient simply to put a price on forest carbon. Instead, to permanently reduce and stop global deforestation, REDD needs to trigger a change in our dominant human development model, which will require policy reforms and enforcement to prevent markets from driving deforestation. Among other things, this needs to be reflected in the design of a REDD mechanism, which must i) pay heed to the complex task of reducing deforestation, allowing for a flexible, \ncountry-specific approach, to ensure broad participation to tackle deforestation on a global scale; ii) address deforestation by integrating REDD into overall development planning, to achieve lasting results and maximize synergies with other development goals; and iii) be consistent with the overall mitigation effort to prevent dangerous climate change. \nThe scope of REDD, definitions and several methodological issues will have a decisive influence on the extent of benefits, or in some cases even threats, REDD will have for biodiversity conservation and equitable access to REDD. \nThe design of transfer systems at both the international and national level is key to enabling countries to permanently reduce deforestation and forest degradation. To do so, transfer systems must go beyond mere compensation for avoided deforestation. Instead, they must be embedded in overall development planning and engage in providing alternative (at best low-carbon, low-resource) livelihoods. This will require political reforms and investment into other sectors, which may not immediately lead to emission reductions \nin the forest sector. Transfers channelled through a REDD offsetting mechanism are less suited to do so unless proper national transfer systems are in place. Alternatively, the Tropical Deforestation Emission Reduction Mechanism (TDERM) Triptych or the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility, the latter complemented by the UN REDD Programme, could be used as a transitional international transfer system for REDD funds in the period 2013\u2013 2020. Given their comprehensive international approach to tackling deforestation, both can be expected to perform better concerning active consideration of human, and especially indigenous people\u2019s rights, and delivery of benefits other than carbon retention. It is safe to assume that REDD in the period 2013\u20132020 will require several billion US$ a year to set the incentives to reduce deforestation and forest degradation. The real costs may differ significantly from opportunity cost calculations though, both under an offset scheme and a market-linked approach, where prices would either be determined by the \nmarket or be negotiated. While prices will influence a countries decision to reduce deforestation, a price below the opportunity costs would not necessarily reverse a countries decision (and policies) to reduce deforestation. The discussion on how these funds should be raised continues to be the most controversial one. While the demand from the Annex-I compliance market in the 2013\u20132020 period could most likely absorb all emission reductions through a REDD offset mechanism, this would seriously undermine domestic emission reductions in countries listed in Annex-I of the UNFCCC (Annex-I countries) and set the world on a path towards dangerous climate change. Depending on whether Annex-I countries commit to low or ambitious 2020- targets in Copenhagen and the amount of emission reductions from REDD and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), Annex-I countries could offset 24 to 69 % of their emissions via the CDM and REDD (not counting Brazil). Furthermore, the present uncertainty on Annex-I reduction targets and quantitative \u201cREDD targets\u201d set by countries \nnot listed in Annex-I of the UNFCCC (non-Annex-I countries) makes it impossible to foresee the impact of REDD on carbon prices. Two models with different policy \nassumptions show, though, that REDD has a great potential to destabilize the compliance market, unless regulatory instruments, like e. g. banking of credits, are applied. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s (IPCC) 4th Assessment Report, emission reductions of 25\u201340 % in Annex-I and 15\u201330 % in non-Annex-I countries are necessary to see global emissions peak before 2015 and to stabilize the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere at 450 ppm, which is considered the threshold to \ndangerous climate change. To design REDD as an offset mechanism for Annex-I \ncompliance, Annex-I 2020-targets would need to be around 38 %. Limiting the amount of REDD offsets to be used for Annex-I compliance could solve the problem of domestic emission reductions. However, it would also reduce the amount of funding below the level deemed necessary to reduce deforestation significantly. Furthermore, there are legitimate concerns that an offset mechanism could potentially yield lower benefits for biodiversity \nconservation and lead to an inequitable distribution of funds, though this depends strongly on the governance structure and type of national transfer system of each participating country. Market-linked approaches such as the TDERM or another multilateral fund supplied with proceeds from the auctioning of emission allowances would also be able to raise the necessary funding without jeopardizing domestic emission reductions in Annex-I \ncountries. Here, estimates range from 5.7 to 113 bn US$ annually, though the top-end figure would have to be split between finance for adaptation, REDD and technology transfer.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "eadc02d45d21e5ca73a33694515a55407ae47e6e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1991331007", "DOI": "10.1016/S0048-9697(99)00191-6", "CorpusId": 37753998, "PubMed": "10535108"}, "title": "Emissions reduction of high and low polluting new technology vehicles equipped with a CeO2 catalytic system", "abstract": null, "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "5da0350fcd60f20980a4e6e4901a19fb7a99ec61", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1787/weo-2016-10-en", "CorpusId": 48009689}, "title": "Energy and Climate Change", "abstract": "At Ericsson, we aim to minimize the negative environmental impacts of our activities and products in operation, while delivering solutions to enable the low-carbon economy.

In the present study, a cost\u2013benefit analysis was applied after substituting classical fuel for sewage sludge as an alternative fuel in a clinker kiln in Catalonia, Spain.Materials and methodsThe economical benefits resulting in the reduction of CO2 emissions were compared with the changes in human health risks due to exposure to polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) and carcinogenic metals (As, Cd, Co, and Cr) before and after using sewage sludge to generate 20% of the thermal energy needed for pyro-processing. The exposure to PCDD/Fs and metals through air inhalation, soil ingestion and dermal absorption was calculated according to the environmental levels in soil. The carcinogenic risks were assessed, and the associated cost for the population was estimated by considering the DG Environment\u2019s recommended value for preventing a statistical fatality (VPF). In turn, the amount of CO2 emitted was calculated, and the economical saving, according to the market prices, was evaluated.ResultsThe use of sewage sludge as a substitute of conventional energy meant a probability cancer decrease of 4.60 for metals and a cancer risk increase of 0.04 for PCDD/Fs. Overall, a net reduction of 4.56 cancers for one million people can be estimated. The associated economical evaluation due to the decreasing cancer for 60,000 people, the current population living near the cement plant, would be of 0.56 million euros (US$ 0.83 million). In turn, a reduction of 144,000\u00a0tons of CO2 emitted between 2003 and 2006 was estimated. Considering a cost of 20 euros per ton of CO2, the global saving would be 2.88 million euros (US$ 4.26 million).DiscussionAfter the partial substitution of the fuel, the current environmental exposure to metals and PCDD/Fs would even mean a potential decrease of health risks for the individuals living in the vicinity of the cement plant. The total benefit of using sewage sludge as an alternative fuel was calculated in 3.44 million euros (US$ 5.09 million). Environmental economics is becoming an interesting research field to convert environmental benefits (i.e., reduction of health risks, emission of pollutants, etc.) into economical value.ConclusionsThe results show, that while the use of sewage sludge as secondary fuel is beneficial for the reduction in GHG emissions, no additional health risks for the population derived from PCDD/F and metal emissions are estimated.Recommendations and perspectivesCost\u2013benefit analysis seems to be a suitable tool to estimate the environmental damage and benefit associated to industrial processes. Therefore, this should become a generalized practice, mainly for those more impacting sectors such as power industries. On the other hand, the extension of the study could vastly be enlarged by taking into account other potentially emitted GHGs, such as CH4 and N2O, as well as other carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic micropollutants.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "dd6484157825f2e5121100278b75e621e3933355", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1997025548", "DOI": "10.1002/hbm.20270", "CorpusId": 45039895, "PubMed": "16773635"}, "title": "Dose\u2010dependent attenuation of auditory phantom perception (tinnitus) by PET\u2010guided repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation", "abstract": "Recent data suggest that chronic tinnitus is a \u201cphantom auditory perception\u201d caused by maladaptive neuroplasticity and subsequent hyperactivity in an extended neuronal network including the primary auditory cortex, higher\u2010order association areas, and parts of the limbic system. It was suggested that attenuation of this tinnitus\u2010associated hyperactivity may offer a rational option for lasting tinnitus reduction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that tinnitus loudness can be attenuated by low\u2010frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) individually navigated to cortical areas with excessive tinnitus\u2010related activity as assessed by [15O]H2O positron\u2010emission tomography (PET). Nine patients with chronic tinnitus underwent this combined functional imaging and rTMS\u2010study. Group analysis of the PET data showed tinnitus\u2010related increases of regional cerebral blood flow in the left middle and inferior temporal as well as right temporoparietal cortex and posterior cingulum. Repetitive TMS was performed at 1 Hz and 120% of the motor threshold for 5, 15, and 30 min, navigated to the individual maximum of tinnitus\u2010related cortical hyperactivity. A noncortical stimulation site with the same distance to the ear served as sham control. Tinnitus loudness was reduced after temporoparietal, PET\u2010guided low\u2010frequency rTMS. This reduction, lasting up to 30 min, was dependent on the number of stimuli applied, differed from sham stimulation, and was negatively correlated with the length of the medical history of tinnitus in our patients. These data show the feasibility and effectiveness of rTMS guided by individual functional imaging to induce a lasting, dose\u2010dependent attenuation of tinnitus. Of note, these effects were related to stimulation of cortical association areas, not primary auditory cortex, emphasizing the crucial role of higher\u2010order sensory processing in the pathophysiology of chronic tinnitus.

In this context, building information modelling (BIM), can help the sustainability agenda as the digitalization of product and process information provides a unique opportunity to optimize energy-efficiency-related decisions across the entire lifecycle and supply chain.

Thus, there is a need to identify the key factors affecting the climate effects of natural gas versus coal electricity production, and to present these climate effects in as clear and transparent a way as possible. Here, we identify power plant efficiencies and methane leakage rates as the factors that explain most of the variance in greenhouse gas emissions by natural gas and coal power plants. Thus, we focus on the role of these factors in determining the relative merits of natural gas versus coal power plants. We develop a simple model estimating CO2 and CH4 emissions from natural gas and coal power plants, and resulting temperature change. Simple underlying physical changes can be obscured by abstract evaluation metrics, thus we focus our analysis on the time evolution of global mean temperature. We find that, during the period of plant operation, if there is substantial methane leakage, natural gas plants can produce greater near-term warming than coal plants with the same power output. However, if methane leakage rates are low and power plant efficiency is high, natural gas plants can produce some reduction in near-term warming. In the long term, natural gas power plants produce less warming than would occur with coal power plants. However, without carbon capture and storage natural gas power plants cannot achieve the deep reductions that would be required to avoid substantial contribution to additional global warming.

In our global, general equilibrium analysis of carbon taxation, we find that forest carbon sequestration is the dominant means for global GHG emissions reduction in the land using sectors. However, when compared to the rest of the world, emissions abatement in the US comes disproportionately from agriculture, and, within agriculture, disproportionately from reductions in fertilizer-related emissions (primarily in maize production). In the world as a whole, agriculture-related mitigation comes predominantly in reduced methane emissions from ruminant livestock, which is followed in relative importance by reductions in methane emissions from paddy rice. We also find significant linkages between emissions in one region and mitigation in another (i.e. leakage). For example, in the US agriculture, abatement potential is cut in half when we move from a national tax to a global carbon tax. This is a consequence of the strong export orientation of US agriculture, which responds to reduced production in the rest of the world by increasing its own production and hence emissions.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "6e0d2159bcea511059f3f44dbe5a9e7d02c520ae", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2037408850", "DOI": "10.1243/09544070JAUTO1270", "CorpusId": 110512279}, "title": "The impact of biodiesel blend ratio on vehicle performance and emissions", "abstract": "Abstract Biodiesel is synthesized via the transesterification of triglycerides contained within vegetable, animal, or waste oils.

The biodiesel content within diesel sold to consumers is set to increase in the future, with implications on vehicle fuel consumption, emissions, and base engine durability. This study examines the effects of increasing the biodiesel blend ratio on the performance and emissions of a production vehicle equipped with a common-rail direct-injection diesel engine, evaluated on a chassis rolls dynamometer, at various ambient temperatures. Results obtained show that reductions in engine-out carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions do not always translate to lower tailpipe emissions as reduced exhaust gas temperatures at higher blend ratios lead to reduced catalyst conversion efficiencies and higher total cycle emissions. Catalyst conversion efficiencies for carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons over the New European Drive Cycle (NEDC) are reduced by 9\u201319 per cent (depending on the ambient temperature) for a 50:50 blend (B50) compared with the petroleum diesel (B0) baseline. Increasing the blend ratio caused a linear decrease in the vehicle's maximum tractive force.

To this end, this article presents an overall integrated model that solves simultaneously the refinery planning, hydrogen, and CO2 management problems. It addresses the optimum CO2 strategy selection through integration of refinery planning with the hydrogen network and CO2 emissions. The overall model was formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear program (MINLP). The model consists of the refinery emission sources and the considered mitigation options. Model performance was tested through different case studies with various reduction targets. The optimization results showed that the integration of the planning, hydrogen, and CO2 models lead to better profit margins and that CO2 mitigation options worked successfully together to meet a given reduction target. The obtained results also showed that the load shifting option can contribute up to a 3% reduction of CO2 emissions, while the fuel switching option can provide a 20% reduction.

Since most agricultural GHG emissions originate from non-point sources, they cannot be directly measured, and therefore have to be derived by calculation schemes (indicators). We designed five such GHG indicators for dairy farms and analyzed the trade-offs between their feasibility, measurement accuracy, and level of induced abatement costs. Analyses of induced abatement costs and calculation accuracy are based on emission reduction simulations with a highly-detailed single-farm optimization model. Feasibility is discussed in a qualitative manner. Our results indicate that the trade-offs depend on both farm characteristics and the targeted reduction level. In particular, the advantages of detailed indicators decrease for higher abatement levels. Only the least feasible indicator led to abatement costs that would result in emission efforts at given prices in the European Emissions Trading Scheme, although with a rather small potential.

Rapid changes in today\u2019s society require that these inventories provide contemporary estimates of multiple atmospheric pollutants with both source sector and fuel type information to understand and effectively mitigate future impacts. To fill this need, we have updated the open-source Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) (Hoesly et al., 2019) to develop a new global emission inventory, CEDSGBD-MAPS. This inventory includes emissions of seven key atmospheric pollutants (NOx ; CO; SO2; NH3; non-methane volatile organic compounds, NMVOCs; black carbon, BC; organic carbon, OC) over the time period from 1970\u20132017 and reports annual country-total emissions as a function of 11 anthropogenic sectors (agriculture; energy generation; industrial processes; on-road and non-road transportation; separate residential, commercial, and other sectors (RCO); waste; solvent use; and international shipping) and four fuel categories (total coal, solid biofuel, the sum of liquid-fuel and natural-gas combustion, and remaining process-level emissions). The CEDSGBD-MAPS inventory additionally includes monthly global gridded (0.5\u00d7 0.5) emission fluxes for each compound, sector, and fuel type to facilitate their use in earth system models. CEDSGBD-MAPS utilizes updated activity data, updates to the core CEDS default scaling procedure, and modifications to the final procedures for emissions gridding and aggregation. Relative to the previous CEDS inventory (Hoesly et al., 2018), these updates extend the emission estimates from 2014 to 2017 and improve the overall agreement between CEDS and two widely used global bottom-up emission inventories.

McDuffie et al.: A global anthropogenic emission inventory of atmospheric pollutants CEDSGBD-MAPS inventory provides the most contemporary global emission estimates to date for these key atmospheric pollutants and is the first to provide global estimates for these species as a function of multiple fuel types and source sectors. Dominant sources of global NOx and SO2 emissions in 2017 include the combustion of oil, gas, and coal in the energy and industry sectors as well as on-road transportation and international shipping for NOx . Dominant sources of global CO emissions in 2017 include on-road transportation and residential biofuel combustion. Dominant global sources of carbonaceous aerosol in 2017 include residential biofuel combustion, on-road transportation (BC only), and emissions from the waste sector. Global emissions of NOx , SO2, CO, BC, and OC all peak in 2012 or earlier, with more recent emission reductions driven by large changes in emissions from China, North America, and Europe. In contrast, global emissions of NH3 and NMVOCs continuously increase between 1970 and 2017, with agriculture as a major source of global NH3 emissions and solvent use, energy, residential, and the on-road transport sectors as major sources of global NMVOCs.

The varying-domain method is then utilized to introduce a flexible priority among objectives and to transform the multiobjective problem into a nonlinear programming problem, the optimal solution of which is subsequently found by a genetic algorithm, i.e., GENOCOPIII. A comparison of the simulation results demonstrates the flexibility of the proposed varying-domain optimal management strategy (VOMS) under different driving conditions.

We used a prospective design to study 20 treatment-naive adults with ADHD who were evaluated before treatment initiation and after 12 months of clinical treatment with a titrated regimen of oral methylphenidate. Methylphenidate-induced dopamine changes were evaluated with positron emission tomography and [11C]raclopride (D2/D3 receptor radioligand sensitive to competition with endogenous dopamine). Clinical responses were assessed using the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale and revealed a significant reduction in symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity with long-term methylphenidate treatment. A challenge dose of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous methylphenidate significantly increased dopamine in striatum (assessed as decreases in D2/D3 receptor availability). In the ventral striatum, these dopamine increases were associated with the reductions in ratings of symptoms of inattention with clinical treatment. Statistical parametric mapping additionally showed dopamine increases in prefrontal and temporal cortices with intravenous methylphenidate that were also associated with decreases in symptoms of inattention. Our findings indicate that dopamine enhancement in ventral striatum (the brain region involved with reward and motivation) was associated with therapeutic response to methylphenidate, further corroborating the relevance of the dopamine reward/motivation circuitry in ADHD.

First, assuming that all available advanced technologies are almost adopted, this study puts forward some key potential-sectors and explores an optimal technical route for reducing CO2 emissions from the Chinese steel industry based on whole process analysis. The results show that in the stages of coking, sintering, and iron making, greater potential for reducing emissions would be fulfilled by taking some technological measures. If only would above well-developed technologies be fulfill, the CO2 emissions from 5 industry production stages would be reduced substantially, and CO2 emissions per ton of steel could be decreased to 1.24 (ton/ton-steel) by 2020. At the same time, the scenarios analysis indicates that if mature carbon-reducing technologies are adopted, and if the difference between steel output growth rate and the GDP growth rate could be controlled below 3%, CO2 emissions from China\u2019s steel industry would approach the goal of reducing CO2 emissions per GDP unit by 40%\u201345% of the 2005 level by 2020.

Canopy emissions of volatile hydrocarbons such as isoprene and monoterpenes play an important role in air chemistry. They depend on various environmental conditions, are highly species-specific and are expected to be affected by global change. In order to estimate future emissions of these isoprenoids, differently complex models are available. However, seasonal dynamics driven by phenology, enzymatic activity, or drought stress strongly modify annual ecosystem emissions. Although these impacts depend themselves on environmental conditions, they have yet received little attention in mechanistic modelling. In this paper we propose the application of a mechanistic method for considering the seasonal dynamics of emission potential using the \"Seasonal Isoprenoid synthase Model\" (Lehning et al., 2001). We test this approach with three different models (GUENTHER, Guenther et al., 1993; NIINEMETS, Niinemets et al., 2002a; BIM2, Grote et al., 2006) that are developed for simulating light-dependent monoterpene emission. We also suggest specific drought stress representations for each model. Additionally, the proposed model developments are compared with the approach realized in the MEGAN (Guenther et al., 2006) emission model. Models are applied to a Mediterranean Holm oak (Quercus ilex) site with measured weather data. The simulation results demonstrate that the consideration of a dynamic emission potential has a strong effect on annual monoterpene emission estimates. The investigated models, however, show different sensitivities to the procedure for determining this seasonality impact. Considering a drought impact reduced the differences between the applied models and decreased emissions at the investigation site by approximately 33% on average over a 10 year period. Although this overall reduction was similar in all models, the sensitivity to weather conditions in specific years was different. We conclude that the proposed implementations of drought stress and internal seasonality strongly reduce estimated emissions and indicate the measurements that are needed to further evaluate the models.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "45f468794a34646572f71d348a57ed73a10b5e7a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2075278153", "DOI": "10.1115/1.2906885", "CorpusId": 100380943}, "title": "Exhaust emissions from two intercity passenger locomotives", "abstract": "To enhance the effectiveness of intercity passenger rail service in mitigating exhaust emissions in California, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) included limits on exhaust emissions in its intercity locomotive procurement specifications.

The two passenger locomotives (an EMD F59PH and a GE DASH8-32BWH) were tested at the Association of American Railroads Chicago Technical Center. The EMD locomotive was equipped with a separate Detroit Diesel Corporation (DDC) 8V-149 diesel engine used to provide 480 V AC power for the trailing passenger cars. This DDC engine was also emission tested. These data were used to quantify baseline exhaust emission levels as a challenge to locomotive manufacturers to offer new locomotives with reduced emissions. Data from the two locomotive engines were recorded at standard fuel injection timing and with the fuel injection timing retarded 4 deg in an effort to reduce NO[sub x] emissions.
