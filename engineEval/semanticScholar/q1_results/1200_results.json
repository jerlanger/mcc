Despite urbanization being a major driver of land-use change globally, there have been few attempts to quantify and map ecosystem service provision at a city-wide scale. One service that is an increasingly important feature of climate change mitigation policies, and with other potential benefits, is biological carbon storage. 2. We examine the quantities and spatial patterns of above-ground carbon stored in a typical British city, Leicester, by surveying vegetation across the entire urban area. We also consider how carbon density differs in domestic gardens, indicative of bottom-up management of private green spaces by householders, and public land, representing top-down landscape policies by local authorities. Finally, we compare a national ecosystem service map with the estimated quantity and distribution of above-ground carbon within our study city. 3. An estimated 231 521 tonnes of carbon is stored within the above-ground vegetation of Leicester, equating to 3AE16 kg C m )2 of urban area, with 97AE3% of this carbon pool being associated with trees rather than herbaceous and woody vegetation. 4. Domestic gardens store just 0AE76 kg C m )2 , which is not significantly different from herbaceous vegetation landcover (0AE14 kg C m )2 ). The greatest above-ground carbon density is 28AE86 kg Cm )2 , which is associated with areas of tree cover on publicly owned \u2044 managed sites. 5. Current national estimates of this ecosystem service undervalue Leicester\u2019s contribution by an order of magnitude. 6. Synthesis and applications. The UK government has recently set a target of an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, from 1990 levels, by 2050. Local authorities are central to national efforts to cut carbon emissions, although the reductions required at city-wide scales are yet to be set. This has led to a need for reliable data to help establish and underpin realistic carbon emission targets and reduction trajectories, along with acceptable and robust policies for meeting these goals. Here, we illustrate the potential benefits of accounting for, mapping and appropriately managing aboveground vegetation carbon stores, even within a typical densely urbanized European city.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "a6675369df9199bf5864750099b61e8eca02d36c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2159018383", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.1669161", "CorpusId": 20826127}, "title": "The Optimal Climate Policy Portfolio When Knowledge Spills Across Sectors", "abstract": "This paper studies the implications for climate policy of the interactions between environmental and knowledge externalities.

However, considerable uncertainties still exist in the current estimation methodologies for biogenic emissions. The impact of these uncertainties on ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) levels for the eastern United States was studied, focusing on biogenic emissions estimates from two commonly used biogenic emission models, the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN) and the Biogenic Emissions Inventory System (BEIS). Photochemical grid modeling simulations were performed for two scenarios: one reflecting present day conditions and the other reflecting a hypothetical future year with reductions in emissions of anthropogenic oxides of nitrogen (NOx). For ozone, the use of MEGAN emissions resulted in a higher ozone response to hypothetical anthropogenic NOx emission reductions compared with BEIS. Applying the current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidance on regulatory air quality modeling in conjunction with typical maximum ozone concentrations, the differences in estimated future year ozone design values (DVF) stemming from differences in biogenic emissions estimates were on the order of 4 parts per billion (ppb), corresponding to approximately 5% of the daily maximum 8-hr ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) of 75 ppb. For PM2.5, the differences were 0.1\u20130.25 \u03bcg/m3 in the summer total organic mass component of DVFs, corresponding to approximately 1\u20132% of the value of the annual PM2.5 NAAQS of 15 \u03bcg/m3. Spatial variations in the ozone and PM2.5 differences also reveal that the impacts of different biogenic emission estimates on ozone and PM2.5 levels are dependent on ambient levels of anthropogenic emissions. IMPLICATIONS The findings presented in this study demonstrate that uncertainties in biogenic emission estimates due to different emission models can have a significant effect on the model estimates of ozone and PM2.5 concentrations; specifically, the changes in these concentrations due to reductions in anthropogenic emissions considered in regulatory modeling scenarios. These results point to the need for further research aimed at improving biogenic emission estimates as well as better characterizing their dependency on environmental factors and the fate of these emissions once released into the atmosphere.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "dbd12f45dfa38c00ce58250b6709c39425819b70", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1988566791", "DOI": "10.3141/1815-02", "CorpusId": 109204605}, "title": "Energy Efficiency Strategies for Freight Trucking: Potential Impact on Fuel Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "abstract": "Trucking is the dominant mode of domestic freight and offers a substantial opportunity to improve transportation energy efficiency and reduce the emission of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs).

The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large-scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks.

Key factors affecting the competitiveness of terrestrial mitigation options are land availability and cost effectiveness relative to other options including CO2 capture and storage, energy efficiency improvements, fuel switching, and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emission reductions. The analysis results show that, at lower CO2 prices and in the near term, soil carbon and other agricultural/forestry options can be important bridges to the future, initially providing a substantial portion of attainable reductions in net greenhouse gas emissions, but with a limited role in later years. At higher CO2 prices, afforestation and biofuels are more dominant among terrestrial options to offset greenhouse gas emissions.

Moreover, with the help of simulations we illustrate that a traffic control strategy, particularly an MPC strategy, aiming at the reduction of the TTS does not necessarily reduce the level of emissions. In particular, when the traffic flow is congested, we demonstrate that a traffic control strategy that addresses TTS (or improvement of the traffic flow) alone can cause an increment in the level of emissions and vice versa.

Agricultural emissions of methane in the EU-15 have recently been estimated at 10.2 million tonnes per year and represent the greatest source. Of these, approximately two-thirds come from enteric fermentation and one-third from livestock manure. Fermentation of feeds in the rumen is the largest source of methane from enteric fermentation and this paper considers in detail the reasons for, and the consequences of, the fact that the molar percentage of the different volatile fatty acids pro- duced during fermentation influences the production of methane in the rumen. Acetate and butyrate promote methane production while propionate formation can be considered as a competitive pathway for hydrogen use in the rumen. The many alternative approaches to reducing methane are considered, both in terms of reduction per animal and reduction per unit of animal product. It was concluded that the most promising areas for future research for reducing methanogenesis are the development of new products/delivery systems for anti-methanogenic compounds or alternative electron acceptors in the rumen and reduction in protozoal numbers in the rumen. It is also stressed that the reason ruminants are so important to mankind is that much of the world's biomass is rich in fibre.

However, this will probably require targeted additional support because the highest biodiversity threats and human development needs may exist in countries that have limited income potentials from RED.

Traditionally, the emission lines employed are in the visible wavelength range, and the number of suitable lines is limited. Furthermore, when using these lines, large systematic uncertainties in helium abundance determinations arise due to the degeneracy of physical parameters, such as temperature and density. Recently, Izotov, Thuan, & Guseva (2014) have pioneered adding the He I \u03bb10830 infrared emission line in helium abundance determinations. The strong electron density dependence of He I \u03bb10830 makes it ideal for better constraining density, potentially breaking the degeneracy with temperature. We revisit our analysis of the dataset published by Izotov, Thuan, & Stasianska (2007) and incorporate the newly available observations of He I \u03bb10830 by scaling them using the observed-to-theoretical Paschen-gamma ratio. The solutions are better constrained, in particular for electron density, temperature, and the neutral hydrogen fraction, improving the model fit to data, with the result that more spectra now pass screening for quality and reliability, in addition to a standard 95% confidence level cut. Furthermore, the addition of He I \u03bb10830 decreases the uncertainty on the helium abundance for all galaxies, with reductions in the uncertainty ranging from 10\u201380%. Overall, we find a reduction in the uncertainty on Yp by over 50%.

Mitigation strategies for reducing N2O emissions in New Zealand focus on (i) reducing the amount of N excreted to pasture, e.g. through diet manipulation; (ii) increasing the N use efficiency of excreta or fertilizer, e.g. through grazing management or use of nitrification inhibitors; or (iii) avoiding soil conditions that favour denitrification e.g. improving drainage and reducing soil compaction.

In recent years, transportation air quality analysis has shifted to an activityspecific modeling approach that correlates emissions to vehicle operating mode. With an activity-specific approach, the emission reduction potential of a TCM can be evaluated by its ability to decrease time spent in modes in which emissions are disproportionately elevated. Signal timing improvements are attractive TCMs for traffic flow improvement.

The EDGAR-HTAP project compiled a global emission dataset with annual inventories for CH4, NMVOC, CO, SO2, NOx, NH3, PM10, PM2.5, BC and OC and covering the period 2000-2005 using, to the extent possible, official or scientific inventories at the national or regional scale that are likely to be acceptable for policy makers in each region of the world. This compilation of different official inventories from EMEP, UNFCCC, EPA for USA, GAINS for China and REAS was first gap-filled with global emission data of EDGARv4.1. The IPCC code or UNFCCC's Common Reporting Format, is used as key for harmonizing the data at sector level. Next, the resulting emissions by country and sector were allocated to a 0.1 degree times 0.1 degree grid consistently using the EDGARv4.1 proxy data. The emissions of EDGAR-HTAP were compared with the emission inventory used for the Representative Concentration Pathways for the next IPCC Assessment Report Differences between the national inventories and other bottom-up estimates shows the impact of using higher tier methods and/or country-specific emission factors for compiling a national inventory. Weaknesses in the official emission reports in the EMEP domain were in particular found for diffusive sources. A paradigm of high quality emission inventories consists in scoring high for IPCC's \"T-A-C-CC-A\" (Transparency-Accuracy-Consistency-Comparability-Completeness) principles. Weaknesses remain in the coherency across borders between different national inventories, in particular when using different datasets applying different inventorying techniques.

A goal is to evaluate the air quality impacts occurring between 1990 and 2009 that are associated with concurrent legislatively mandated changes in emissions. Four 5-year periods, 1990\u20131994 (P1), 1995\u20131999 (P2), 2000\u20132004 (P3), and 2005\u20132009 (P4) are considered, with a primary focus on P1-to-P4 changes. Results suggest that legislatively mandated air pollution mitigation strategies have been successful in improving air quality and reducing atmospheric deposition in the eastern US. Respective P1-to-P4 reductions of estimated sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions in the eastern US are 50 and 42%.

Selected period-to-period changes of air quality and deposition metrics at site, regional, and seasonal scales are discussed. As an example, despite P1-to-P3 reductions in estimated emissions of both SO2 and NOx, aerosol NO3 concentration increased in the east, with widespread wintertime numerical increases in both aerosol NO3 concentration and CASTNET PM. However, a reversal of this behavior is associated with continuing P3-to-P4 reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions. Thus, additional P3-to-P4 reductions of these emissions, especially NOx, appear to have made progress in altering the chemical regime of the wintertime eastern US atmosphere so that future emissions reductions and their resulting reductions in aerosol concentrations may no longer be accompanied by sub-linear changes (or actual increases) in CASTNET PM.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "f43ad3267082a1eea0b1ad34a06363c66935d06f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1537971426", "DOI": "10.4271/880348", "CorpusId": 94688398}, "title": "The reduction in diesel particulate emissions using emulsified fuels", "abstract": "Although water injection or water/fuel emulsions are a well known method of reducing NO/sub x/ in stationary Diesel engines, their influence on Diesel particulates and particulate SOF has received little study.

Abstract v Abstract This report summarizes the results of a research program that assessed the technology of light-duty vehicles and fuels that could be developed and commercialized during the next 25 years. The research was done at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from mid-2005 to mid-2008. Our objective was to assess and compare options for reducing fuel consumption, especially fuels from petroleum and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, during the production and use of both fuels and vehicles. This is a successor to our 2000 report, \" On the Road in 2020, \" which addressed similar objectives. Since that report was written, the world has moved on with new vehicle and fuel technologies, and with inexorably increasing worldwide demand for all transportation services. That demand lends more urgency to curbing the growth of consumption of petroleum fuel and of GHG emissions. Our research for the current report was confined to industrialized countries, with an emphasis on the United States but also including some western European countries. We first assessed the application of new vehicle and fuel technologies to the performance, cost, and life-cycle emissions of individual vehicles. We then considered the effects on the total on-the-road fleet of introducing those technologies using plausible assumptions about how rapidly they could be developed, manufactured, and sold to buyers to replace existing vehicles and fuels or to add to the total fleet. We have concluded that a 30\u201350% reduction in fuel consumption is feasible over the next 30 years. In the short-term, this will come as a result of improved gasoline and diesel engines and transmissions, gasoline hybrids, and reductions in vehicle weight and drag. If these improvements are achieved, we estimate a $1,500\u2013$4,500 increase in vehicle costs. Over the longer term, plug-in hybrids and later still, hydrogen fuel cells may enter the fleet in numbers sufficient to have significant an impact on fuel use and emissions. Alternative fuels that replace petroleum fuels are unlikely to change GHG emissions significantly. The major near-term alternatives are based on fossil raw materials like the Canadian oil sands or coal, which increase GHG emissions. Some biofuels may prove beneficial, depending on the particular biomass feedstock and conversion technology. But the U.S. emphasis on corn-based ethanol is not obviously justifiable.

In traditional cage systems and alternative, welfare-oriented, housing systems for laying hens two types of waste can be distinguished, namely manure and litter. Manure is encountered as slurry or as dry manure. Litter on the floor is a dry and granular mixture of faeces and e.g. sand. It is used by the hens for dust bathing and scratching. In the processes involved in the emission of ammonia, the most important process parameters are temperature, Ph and water activity, i.e. the availability of water for micro-organisms in the substrate. Air temperature, relative humidity and air velocity define the influencing climatic conditions best. Despite the effectiveness of Ph control, application of this measure has too many negative side-effects. Forced drying of manure seems the only effective and acceptable way for temporary control of ammonia emissions inside housing systems. Regular removal of manure out of the house is always necessary. \n \nReduction of ammonia emissions can be achieved by changing over from housing systems with composting (emission rate 386 g NH3/hen a) to battery systems with manure belts underneath the cages (emission rate 34 g NH3/(hen a), which enable drying of manure and regular removal. The drying rate of the manure and the frequency of removal are crucial in relation to the emission. Minimum emission from manure is achieved if a dry matter content of 60% is reached within 50 h after excretion of the faeces. The emission from battery systems with belts can be reduced to 10 g NH3/(hen a) if the manure is removed from the house twice daily instead of twice weekly.

Of foremost concern for indoor air quality, reductions to these emissions could also impact both climate and ambient air quality. These potential cobenefits are appealing to efforts aimed at reducing cookstove emissions on national to urban scales, but have yet to be comprehensively evaluated at these scales. We thus estimate the per cookstove impacts on ambient air quality and global mean surface temperature for every individual country with significant cookstove use, considering reductions to both aerosols and long-lived greenhouse gases over the next century. This estimation provides information for policy makers evaluating climate and ambient air quality cobenefits of cookstove intervention programs worldwide. Residential solid fuel use contributes to degraded indoor and ambient air quality and may affect global surface temperature. However, the potential for national-scale cookstove intervention programs to mitigate the latter issues is not yet well known, owing to the spatial heterogeneity of aerosol emissions and impacts, along with coemitted species. Here we use a combination of atmospheric modeling, remote sensing, and adjoint sensitivity analysis to individually evaluate consequences of a 20-y linear phase-out of cookstove emissions in each country with greater than 5% of the population using solid fuel for cooking. Emissions reductions in China, India, and Ethiopia contribute to the largest global surface temperature change in 2050 [combined impact of \u221237 mK (11 mK to \u221285 mK)], whereas interventions in countries less commonly targeted for cookstove mitigation such as Azerbaijan, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan have the largest per cookstove climate benefits.

A review of animal management mitigation options.", "abstract": "The goal of this review was to analyze published data on animal management practices that mitigate enteric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from animal operations. Increasing animal productivity can be a very effective strategy for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of livestock product. Improving the genetic potential of animals through planned cross-breeding or selection within breeds and achieving this genetic potential through proper nutrition and improvements in reproductive efficiency, animal health, and reproductive lifespan are effective approaches for improving animal productivity and reducing GHG emission intensity. In subsistence production systems, reduction of herd size would increase feed availability and productivity of individual animals and the total herd, thus lowering CH4 emission intensity. In these systems, improving the nutritive value of low-quality feeds for ruminant diets can have a considerable benefit on herd productivity while keeping the herd CH4 output constant or even decreasing it. Residual feed intake may be a tool for screening animals that are low CH4 emitters, but there is currently insufficient evidence that low residual feed intake animals have a lower CH4 yield per unit of feed intake or animal product. Reducing age at slaughter of finished cattle and the number of days that animals are on feed in the feedlot can significantly reduce GHG emissions in beef and other meat animal production systems. Improved animal health and reduced mortality and morbidity are expected to increase herd productivity and reduce GHG emission intensity in all livestock production systems. Pursuing a suite of intensive and extensive reproductive management technologies provides a significant opportunity to reduce GHG emissions. Recommended approaches will differ by region and species but should target increasing conception rates in dairy, beef, and buffalo, increasing fecundity in swine and small ruminants, and reducing embryo wastage in all species. Interactions among individual components of livestock production systems are complex but must be considered when recommending GHG mitigation practices.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "a11546b32f102b2e0b0dcacf883b013e2e69727a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2181485155", "DOI": "10.1071/AR99002", "CorpusId": 55273244}, "title": "Methane emissions from Australian livestock: implications of the Kyoto Protocol", "abstract": "Human activities have increased the atmospheric concentration of methane by about 140% since pre- industrial times.

Australian livestock emissions are projected to increase by 7% by 2010 with total Australian emissions expected to increase by 28n43%. Emissions per unit GDP are higher for the livestock sector than for most other sectors and this may neg- atively affect the sector if free market emission trading is implemented and no new technologies to reduce emis- sions cost-effectively are introduced.

It is well known that water/diesel (W/ D) emulsions with up to 20% water can reduce PM and NOx emissions in heavy-duty (HD) engines. The amount of water that can be used in emulsions for the technically more susceptible light-duty (LD) vehicles is much lower, due to risks of impairing engine performance and durability.

For PM, the emulsions reduced the emissions with -32% for LD vehicles (mass/km) and -59% for the HD engine (mass/ kWh).

Patients were studied by FDG-PET before and after the first cycle of therapy. Based on previous studies, a reduction of tumor FDG uptake by more than 20% as assessed by standardized uptake values (SUV) was used as a criterion for a metabolic response. Furthermore, changes in tumor SUVs were compared with changes in FDG net-influx constants (Ki) and tumor/muscle ratios (t/m).\n\n\nRESULTS\nFifty-seven patients were included in the study. There was a close correlation between metabolic response and best response to therapy according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (P <.0001; sensitivity and specificity for prediction of best response, 95% and 74%, respectively). Median time to progression and overall survival were significantly longer for metabolic responders than for metabolic nonresponders (163 v 54 days and 252 days v 151 days, respectively). Similar results were obtained when Ki was used to assess tumor glucose use, whereas changes in t/m showed considerable overlap between responding and nonresponding tumors.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn NSCLC, reduction of metabolic activity after one cycle of chemotherapy is closely correlated with final outcome of therapy.

To explore and obtain the temporal and spatial characteristics of NOx emissions from thermal power plants in China, a unit-based method is developed. The method assesses NOx emissions based on detailed information on unit capacity, boiler and burner patterns, feed fuel types, emission control technologies, and geographical locations. The national total NOx emissions in 2010 are estimated at 7801.6 kt, of which 5495.8 kt is released from coal-fired power plant units of considerable size between 300 and 1000 MW. The top provincial emitter is Shandong where plants are densely concentrated. The average NOx-intensity is estimated at 2.28 g/kWh, markedly higher than that of developed countries, mainly owing to the inadequate application of high-efficiency denitrification devices such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Future NOx emissions are predicted by applying scenario analysis, indicating that a reduction of about 40% by the year 2020 can be achieved compared with emissions in 2010.

Here we use measurements in firn (perennial snowpack) air from Greenland and Antarctica to reconstruct the atmospheric variability of ethane (C2H6) during the twentieth century. Ethane levels rose from early in the century until the 1980s, when the trend reversed, with a period of decline over the next 20\u2009years. We find that this variability was primarily driven by changes in ethane emissions from fossil fuels; these emissions peaked in the 1960s and 1970s at 14\u201316 teragrams per year (1\u2009Tg = 1012\u2009g) and dropped to 8\u201310\u2009Tg\u2009yr\u22121 by the turn of the century. The reduction in fossil-fuel sources is probably related to changes in light hydrocarbon emissions associated with petroleum production and use.

Implications for greenhouse gases (N2O and CH4) and support energy have also been considered. Substantial reductions in inputs and total and proportional losses by all die options considered were predicted by this study. Thus, using a tactical approach to fertilizer application and injecting slurry or using 50% maize silage reduced overall N losses from 160 (under conventional management) to 86 and 109kg Nha\u22121 respectively. Combining both possibilities reduced losses further to 69 kg ha\u22121. Although use of white clover, especially at low contents in the sward, was the most effective regime to reduce losses, this was at some cost to production so that losses per livestock unit (LU) did not always differ from those under other managements. Changing the N management had consequences for greenhouse gas emission with an estimated maximum 70% reduction in N2O release. The effects on CH4 emissions were relatively small.

Wood production statistics and spatial modelling of forest growth were used to estimate quantities of pulpwood, in\u2010forest residues, and wood processing residues. Possible new production systems for oil from algae and the oil\u2010seed tree Pongamia pinnata, and of lignocellulosic biomass production from short\u2010rotation coppiced eucalypt crops were also examined. The following constraints were applied to biomass production and use: avoiding clearing of native vegetation; minimizing impacts on domestic food security; retaining a portion of agricultural and forest residues to protect soil; and minimizing the impact on local processing industries by diverting only the export fraction of grains or pulpwood to bioenergy. We estimated that it would be physically possible to produce 9.6 GL yr\u22121 of first generation ethanol from current production systems, replacing 6.5 GL yr\u22121 of gasoline or 34% of current gasoline usage. Current production systems for waste oil, tallow and canola seed could produce 0.9 GL yr\u22121 of biodiesel, or 4% of current diesel usage. Cellulosic biomass from current agricultural and forestry production systems (including biomass from hardwood plantations maturing by 2030) could produce 9.5 GL yr\u22121 of ethanol, replacing 6.4 GL yr\u22121 of gasoline, or ca. 34% of current consumption. The same lignocellulosic sources could instead provide 35 TWh yr\u22121, or ca. 15% of current electricity production. New production systems using algae and P. pinnata could produce ca. 3.96 and 0.9 GL biodiesel yr\u22121, respectively.

In total, first and second generation fuels from current and new production systems could mitigate 26 Mt CO2\u2010e, which is 38% of road transport emissions and 5% of the national emissions.

There are challenging sustainability issues to consider in the production of large amounts of feedstock for bioenergy in Australia. Bioenergy production can have either positive or negative impacts. Although only the export fraction of grains and sugar was used to estimate first generation biofuels so that domestic food security was not affected, it would have an impact on food supply elsewhere. Environmental impacts on soil, water and biodiversity can be significant because of the large land base involved, and the likely use of intensive harvest regimes. These require careful management. Social impacts could be significant if there were to be large\u2010scale change in land use or management. In addition, although the economic considerations of feedstock production were not covered in this article, they will be the ultimate drivers of industry development.

Two series of complexes have been investigated. The first has the formula Pt(Rphen)(C...CC6H5)2 where Rphen is 1,10-phenanthroline substituted in the 5-position with R = H, Me, Cl, Br, NO2, or C...CC6H5, while the second has the formula Pt(dbbpy)(C=CC6H4X)2 where dbbpy = 4,4'-di(tert-butyl)bipyridine and X = H, Me, F, or NO2. From NMR, IR, and electronic spectroscopies, all of the complexes are assigned a square planar coordination geometry with cis-alkynyl ligands. The crystal structure of Pt(phen)(Ce-CC6H4CH3)2 confirms this assignment. All of the complexes exhibit an absorption band at ca. 400 nm that corresponds to a Pt d-->pi*diimine charge-transfer transition. The variation of lambdamax for this band with substituent variation supports this assignment.

Using Finland as an example, we assessed GHG emissions at three scales: the dung pat, pasture ecosystem, and whole lifecycle of milk or beef production. At the first two levels, dung beetles reduced GHG emissions by up to 7% and 12% respectively, mainly through large reductions in methane (CH4) emissions. However, at the lifecycle level, dung beetles accounted for only a 0.05\u20130.13% reduction of overall GHG emissions. This mismatch derives from the fact that in intensive production systems, only a limited fraction of all cow pats end up on pastures, offering limited scope for dung beetle mitigation of GHG fluxes.

It focuses on a line EMI filter and its combination with a motor EMI filter, along with their effects on attenuation of conducted emission voltage. When no EMI filter is connected, the motor drive cannot meet the conducted emission limits prescribed by Category 3 in the IEC61800-3 regulations. The reason is that the common-mode voltage generated by a voltage-source pulse width modulation (PWM) inverter causes a common-mode leakage current flowing into the ground wire lead through parasitic capacitors inside the motor. When the line EMI filter is connected, the motor drive can meet Category 3. The motor EMI filter eliminates the common-mode voltage from the motor terminals, thus bringing a drastic reduction to the leakage current. The combination of the two EMI filters can comply with the limits prescribed by Category 2, which are much stricter than those by Category 3.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "bbb794f25ad8cb73ac01f05ff18ea6cfb4303522", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2011228107", "DOI": "10.1002/ER.1486", "CorpusId": 95193543}, "title": "Factors affecting transport sector CO2 emissions growth in Latin American and Caribbean countries: An LMDI decomposition analysis", "abstract": "This study determines the factors responsible for the growth of transport sector CO2 emissions in 20 Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries during the 1980\u20132005 period by decomposing the emissions growth into components associated with changes in fuel mix (FM), modal shift and economic growth, as well as changes in emission coefficients (EC) and transportation energy intensity (EI). The key finding of the study is that economic growth and the changes in transportation EI are the principal factors driving transport sector CO2 emission growth in the countries considered. While economic growth is responsible for the increasing trend of transport sector CO2 emissions in Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Peru and Uruguay, the transportation EI effect is driving CO2 emissions in Bolivia, the Caribbean, Cuba, Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Other Latin America, Panama and Paraguay. Both economic activity (EA) and EI effects are found responsible for transport sector CO2 emissions growth in the rest of the Latin American countries. In order to limit CO2 emissions from the transportation sector in LAC countries, decoupling of the growth of CO2 emissions from economic growth is necessary; this can be done through policy instruments to promote fuel switching, modal shifting and reductions in transport sector EI.

The biodiesels were tested neat and as 20% by volume blends with a 15 ppm sulfur petroleum-derived diesel fuel. The test engines were the following: 2002 Cummins ISB and 2003 DDC Series 60. Both engines met the 2004 U.S. emission standard of 2.5 g/bhp-h NO{sub x}+HC (3.35 g/kW-h) and utilized exhaust gas recirculation (EGR). All emission tests employed the heavy-duty transient procedure as specified in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. Reduction in PM emissions and increase in NO{sub x} emissions were observed for all biodiesels in all engines, confirming observations made in older engines. On average PM was reduced by 25% and NO{sub x} increased by 3% for the two engines tested for a variety of B20 blends. These changes are slightly larger in magnitude, but in the same range as observed in older engines. The cetane improver 2-ethyl hexyl nitrate was shown to have no measurable effect on NO{sub x} emissions from B20 in these engines, in contrast to observations reported for older engines. The effect of intake air humidity on NO{sub x} emissions from the Cummins ISB was quantified.more\u00a0\u00bb The CFR NO{sub x}/humidity correction factor was shown to be valid for an engine equipped with EGR, operating at 1700 m above sea level, and operating on conventional or biodiesel.\u00ab\u00a0less", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "d39b880d371dc34d21708f1093a413dc9e958688", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2047197757", "DOI": "10.1029/2002JD003031", "CorpusId": 128826398}, "title": "Reanalysis of tropospheric CO trends: Effects of the 1997\u20131998 wildfires", "abstract": "[1]\u00a0For the past decade NOAA/CMDL has measured tropospheric carbon monoxide from a global network of sampling sites. The resulting data set provides an internally consistent picture of CO in the lower troposphere that is used to study its distribution, trends and budget. All measurements were referenced to the so-called CMDL Reference Scale (WMO 88), which was based on two sets of primary standards produced at CMDL during the late 1980s and early 1990s. A long-term downward trend in tropospheric CO during the 1990s, overlaid with shorter periods of increase and decrease, was indicated from the air measurements. Primary standards prepared in 1999 and 2000 suggested that the scale had drifted upward over time, and that mixing ratios determined in field samples were underestimated. We have applied a time dependent correction to our CO measurements based upon four sets of primary standards. In this paper, we describe the revision of the CO scale and our atmospheric measurements. A reanalysis of tropospheric trends through 2001 was based on the revised global data set. The results support previous reports of a decline in tropospheric CO. This decrease is now found largely confined to the Northern Hemisphere, where dramatic reductions in fossil fuel emissions have reportedly occurred. In contrast, no significant trend is determined in the Southern Hemisphere between 1991 and 2001. Globally averaged CO exhibits large interannual variability, primarily reflecting year to year changes in emissions from biomass burning. Dramatic enhancements of tropospheric CO in 1997 and 1998 resulted from exceptionally widespread wildfires which provided a strong pulse of CO to the atmosphere. In years of extensive boreal biomass burning, fire emissions can perturb CO levels over regional and global scales, disturbing oxidation/reduction chemistry in the troposphere.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "32c7f9c6a7d08438fc034b6095e479905eb0a0f7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1981429953", "DOI": "10.1038/ismej.2013.224", "CorpusId": 8524772, "PubMed": "24351937"}, "title": "Symbiotic relationships between soil fungi and plants reduce N2O emissions from soil", "abstract": "N2O is a potent greenhouse gas involved in the destruction of the protective ozone layer in the stratosphere and contributing to global warming. The ecological processes regulating its emissions from soil are still poorly understood. Here, we show that the presence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), a dominant group of soil fungi, which form symbiotic associations with the majority of land plants and which influence a range of important ecosystem functions, can induce a reduction in N2O emissions from soil. To test for a functional relationship between AMF and N2O emissions, we manipulated the abundance of AMF in two independent greenhouse experiments using two different approaches (sterilized and re-inoculated soil and non-mycorrhizal tomato mutants) and two different soils. N2O emissions were increased by 42 and 33% in microcosms with reduced AMF abundance compared to microcosms with a well-established AMF community, suggesting that AMF regulate N2O emissions. This could partly be explained by increased N immobilization into microbial or plant biomass, reduced concentrations of mineral soil N as a substrate for N2O emission and altered water relations. Moreover, the abundance of key genes responsible for N2O production (nirK) was negatively and for N2O consumption (nosZ) positively correlated to AMF abundance, indicating that the regulation of N2O emissions is transmitted by AMF-induced changes in the soil microbial community. Our results suggest that the disruption of the AMF symbiosis through intensification of agricultural practices may further contribute to increased N2O emissions.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "2d6b880cea180e3726529b14dbd058524977cd85", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2058361728", "DOI": "10.1016/J.APENERGY.2014.04.014", "CorpusId": 154276556}, "title": "Cost of energy saving and CO2 emissions reduction in China\u2019s iron and steel sector", "abstract": null, "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "2af89b69666bf9b128bdb390f43149ae28e93e2e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2299509929", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.5b01331", "CorpusId": 36389607, "PubMed": "26241377"}, "title": "Lifecycle Greenhouse Gas Analysis of an Anaerobic Codigestion Facility Processing Dairy Manure and Industrial Food Waste.", "abstract": "Anaerobic codigestion (AcoD) can address food waste disposal and manure management issues while delivering clean, renewable energy. Quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to implementation of AcoD is important to achieve this goal. A lifecycle analysis was performed on the basis of data from an on-farm AcoD in New York, resulting in a 71% reduction in GHG, or net reduction of 37.5 kg CO2e/t influent relative to conventional treatment of manure and food waste. Displacement of grid electricity provided the largest reduction, followed by avoidance of alternative food waste disposal options and reduced impacts associated with storage of digestate vs undigested manure. These reductions offset digester emissions and the net increase in emissions associated with land application in the AcoD case relative to the reference case. Sensitivity analysis showed that using feedstock diverted from high impact disposal pathways, control of digester emissions, and managing digestate storage emissions were opportunities to improve the AcoD GHG benefits. Regional and parametrized emissions factors for the storage emissions and land application phases would reduce uncertainty.", "year": 2015}]}
