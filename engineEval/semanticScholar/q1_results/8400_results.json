They then go on to discuss the theoretical merits of taxes versus quotas, concluding that theoretically a stable tax would best reflect the true social cost of emissions, which should not change with market conditions. They then go to evaluate the EU Emissions Trading Scheme where allowances for the emission of CO2 are traded (EUAs). The price signals offered by the scheme in its first trading period have been very unsatisfactory with high variability and the price trending down towards very low levels as it has become clear that governments were much too generous in their initial allocation of quotas. What is needed is a stable investment environment for low carbon generation investments. They discuss a number of policy options to achieve this: long period commitments on quotas; allowing unconstrained banking and borrowing of EUAs over multiple periods; long term price declarations to be used in allocation auctions; government issued contracts for differences on the future carbon price; or simply to issue low-carbon electricity contracts. The authors conclude with a discussion of the scope for international agreements on carbon emissions reduction.

National annual total CO2 emissions from combustion of fossil fuels are likely known to within 5\u201310\u202f% for most developed countries. However, uncertainties are inevitably larger (by unknown amounts) for emission estimates at regional and monthly scales, or for developing countries. Given recent international efforts to establish emission reduction targets, independent determination and verification of regional and national scale fossil fuel CO2 emissions are likely to become increasingly important. Here, we take advantage of the fact that precise measurements of 14C in CO2 provide a largely unbiased tracer for recently added fossil-fuel-derived CO2 in the atmosphere and present an atmospheric inversion technique to jointly assimilate observations of CO2 and 14CO2 in order to simultaneously estimate fossil fuel emissions and biospheric exchange fluxes of CO2. Using this method in a set of Observation System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), we show that given the coverage of 14CO2 measurements available in 2010 (969 over North America, 1063 globally), we can recover the US national total fossil fuel emission to better than 1\u202f% for the year and to within 5\u202f% for most months. Increasing the number of 14CO2 observations to \u2009\u223c\u20095000 per year over North America, as recently recommended by the National Academy of Science (NAS) (Pacala et al., 2010), we recover monthly emissions to within 5\u202f% for all months for the US as a whole and also for smaller, highly emissive regions over which the specified data coverage is relatively dense, such as for the New England states or the NY-NJ-PA tri-state area. This result suggests that, given continued improvement in state-of-the art transport models, a measurement program similar in scale to that recommended by the NAS can provide for independent verification of bottom-up inventories of fossil fuel CO2 at the regional and national scale. In addition, we show that the dual tracer inversion framework can detect and minimize biases in estimates of the biospheric flux that would otherwise arise in a traditional CO2-only inversion when prescribing fixed but inaccurate fossil fuel fluxes.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "8bff50698f40b9607aaebe7f9785320f953d872f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1978747616", "DOI": "10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2010.01.006", "CorpusId": 154196666}, "title": "Development of alternative energy sources for GHG emissions reduction in the textile industry by energy recovery from cotton ginning waste", "abstract": null, "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "bcd3352eea25bb321f8db8967fc1f9167a46a947", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1510756530", "DOI": "10.4271/960306", "CorpusId": 106625805}, "title": "PIFFO - Piston Friction Force Measurements During Engine Operation", "abstract": "Fuel consumption of a modern combustion engine is significantly influenced by the mechanical friction losses.

The particles were sampled by using an extractive sampling method and analysed with high time resolution instrumentation EEPS (10 Hz) and CO 2 with a non-dispersive infrared gas analyser (LI-840, LI-COR Inc. 1 Hz).

The volume percentage of diluents (H2O, CO2, and N2) in air stream is systematically changed from 0 to 10. The radiative heat loss term, based on an optically thin model, is included to clearly describe the flame structure and NO emission behaviour especially at low strain rates. The effect of dilution of air stream on the decrease of maximum flame temperature varies as CO2>H2O>N2, even if heat capacity of H2O is the highest. It is also found that the addition of CO2 shows the tendency towards the reduction of flame temperature in both the thermal and chemical sides, while the addition of H2O enhances the reaction chemically and restrains it thermally due to a super\u2010equilibrium effect of the chain carrier radicals caused by the breakdown of H2O in high\u2010temperature region.

We also found significant heterogeneity in VoG, with most of the respondents valuing green somewhere between 0 and 70?cents per pound and with women, on average, willing to pay 7?cents more per saved pound than men.

At sectoral level, manufacturing showed the highest potential emissions reduction, and transportation was the largest accepter of emission quotas. At regional level, western and northeastern areas faced the largest adjustments in allowable emissions, while central and eastern areas required the least amount of adjustment.

For a 450\u2005ppm CO2e stabilization level, the remaining carbon budgets for 2014\u20132100 were negative for the effort-sharing category that emphasizes historical responsibility and capability. For the other three, including the reference \u2018Cost-effectiveness\u2019 category, which showed the highest budget range among all categories, the calculated remaining budgets (20th and 80th percentile ranges) would run out in 21\u201329 years if the current emission levels were to continue. A 550\u2005ppm CO2e stabilization level increases the budgets by 6\u201317 years-equivalent of the current emissions, depending on the effort-sharing category. Exemplary emissions trajectories staying within the calculated budgets were also analysed for \u2018Equality\u2019, \u2018Staged\u2019 and \u2018Cost-effectiveness\u2019 categories. For a 450\u2005ppm CO2e stabilization level, Japan's GHG emissions would need to phase out sometime between 2045 and 2080, and the emission reductions in 2030 would be at least 16\u201329% below 1990 levels even for the most lenient \u2018Cost-effectiveness\u2019 category, and 29\u201336% for the \u2018Equality\u2019 category.

Background: Cerebellopontine angle tumor surgery is associated with a significant risk of damaging internal auditory canal contents. Although monitoring facial nerve function intraoperatively has already been effectively developed, such efficacious monitoring of auditory function remains to be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions for intraoperative monitoring of the cochlear function in humans during removal of cerebellopontine angle tumors. Methods: Continuous intraoperative monitoring of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions was performed in 20 of 62 patients undergoing surgical removal of cerebellopontine angle tumors. All of these 20 patients, who underwent the retrosigmoid approach, had distortion-product otoacoustic emissions present preoperatively. Depending on the amplitude and frequency band at which distortion-product otoacoustic emissions were present, monitoring was carried out at 2.0 to 6.0 kHz with primary stimulus tone amplitudes of 60 to 70 dB sound pressure level. Results: In patients operated on for cerebellopontine angle tumors, various patterns of distortion-product otoacoustic emission amplitude reductions and recoveries were observed. Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions recorded from the basal part of the cochlea (i.e., high frequencies) changed earlier and more profoundly than those from the middle and apical sections (i.e., lower frequencies). In some cases, cochlear function was affected irreversibly as reflected by loss of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. Microcoagulation of small vessels, tumor debulking, and compression or stretch of the internal auditory canal contents were found to be procedures affecting distortion-product otoacoustic emissions. The status of distortion-product otoacoustic emissions at the conclusion of tumor dissection correlated with postoperative hearing levels. Conclusion: Distortion-product otoacoustic emissions were used to monitor in the real-time domain auditory function during cerebellopontine angle tumor removal operations.

The model reproduces the main features observed over Europe for {O}_{3}, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxides, as well as two events of enhanced {O}_{3} of North American origin over the eastern North Atlantic and over Europe. North American {O}_{3} fluxes into Europe experience a maximum in spring and summer, reflecting the seasonal variation in photochemical activity and in export pathways. In summer, North American {O}_{3} enters Europe at higher altitudes and lower latitudes because of deep convection, and because the flow over the North Atlantic is mostly zonal in that season. The low-level inflow is only important in spring, when loss rates in the boundary layer over the North Atlantic are weaker. Asian O3 arrives mainly via the westerlies, and usually at higher altitudes than North American O3 because of stronger deep convection over Asia. In addition, Asian O3 fluxes are at a maximum in summer during the monsoon period because of enhanced convection over Asia, increased nitrogen oxides sources from lightning and direct transport towards Europe via the monsoon easterlies. Over Europe, total background accounts for 30 ppbv at the surface. North American and Asian O3 contribute substantially to the annual O3 budget over Europe, accounting for 10.9% and 7.7%, respectively,while the European contribution only accounts for 9.4%. We find that in summer, at the surface, O3 decreases over Europe from 1980 to 1997, reflecting the reduction of European O3 precursor emissions. In the free troposphere, this decrease is compensated by the increase in O3 due to increasing Asian emissions.

The dynamic hydro-chemical Model of Acidification of Groundwater in Catchments (MAGIC) was used to predict the response of 163 Finnish lake catchments to future acidic deposition and climatic change scenarios. Future deposition was assumed to follow current European emission reduction policies and a scenario based on maximum (technologically) feasible reductions (MFR). Future climate (temperature and precipitation) was derived from the HadAM3 and ECHAM4/OPYC3 general circulation models under two global scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC: A2 and B2). The combinations resulting in the widest range of future changes were used for simulations, i.e., the A2 scenario results from ECHAM4/OPYC3 (highest predicted change) and B2 results from HadAM3 (lowest predicted change). Future scenarios for catchment runoff were obtained from the Finnish watershed simulation and forecasting system. The potential influence of future changes in surface water organic carbon concentrations was also explored using simple empirical relationships based on temperature and sulphate deposition. Surprisingly, current emission reduction policies hardly show any future recovery; however, significant chemical recovery of soil and surface water from acidification was predicted under the MFR emission scenario. The direct influence of climate change (temperate and precipitation) on recovery was negligible, as runoff hardly changed; greater precipitation is offset by increased evapotranspiration due to higher temperatures. However, two exploratory empirical DOC models indicated that changes in sulphur deposition or temperature could have a confounding influence on the recovery of surface waters from acidification, and that the corresponding increases in DOC concentrations may offset the recovery in pH due to reductions in acidifying depositions.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "7cdb1955a74e639f26742c28ab78f0fb87027b53", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/wpc/SanctisCJ11", "MAG": "2058421262", "DOI": "10.1007/s11277-011-0244-4", "CorpusId": 9974466}, "title": "Energy Efficient Wireless Networks Towards Green Communications", "abstract": "Wireless networks have become an essential part of the modern life.

In order to stay in line with the 2\u00b0C target, a tripling or quadrupling of mitigation ambitions is required in all regions by 2050, employing vigorous decarbonization of the energy supply system and achieving negative emissions during the second half of the century. In all regions looked at, decarbonization of energy supply (and in particular power generation) is more important than reducing energy demand. Some differences in abatement strategies across the regions are projected: In India and the USA the emphasis is on prolonging fossil fuel use by coupling conventional technologies with carbon storage, whereas the other main strategy depicts a shift to carbon-neutral technologies with mostly renewables (China, EU) or nuclear power (Japan). Regions with access to large amounts of biomass, such as the USA, China, and the EU, can make a trade-off between energy related emissions and land related emissions, as the use of bioenergy can lead to a net increase in land use emissions. After supply-side changes, the most important abatement strategy focuses on end-use efficiency improvements, leading to considerable emission reductions in both the industry and transport sectors across all regions. Abatement strategies for non-CO2 emissions and land use emissions are found to have a smaller potential.

Current analyses of embodied CO2eq emissions, whether performed at the economic sector or individual building system boundary level, are deterministic. Such deterministic models do not allow for the easy analysis of potential CO2eq emissions reductions obtainable through preferential selection of low embodied CO2eq material suppliers within material supply chains. Such analyses are important for assessing the extent to which emissions reductions can be achieved through economic mechanisms which drive preferential selection of low embodied carbon materials back through the supply chain - such as carbon taxes. It is argued that the need for estimating both the uncertainty, and the variability, in embodied CO2eq data is best addressed through the development of a fully stochastic modelling framework, and that such frameworks are methodologically more appropriate for Kyoto Protocol compliance policy formulation.

However, there have been relatively few efforts in quantifying the emission factors (EFs) and for estimating the potential emission reduction benefits using emission control technologies for these vehicles. This study characterized the black carbon (BC) component of particulate matter and NOx, CO, and CO2 EFs of selected diesel-powered off-road mobile sources in Mexico under real-world operating conditions using on-board portable emissions measurements systems (PEMS). The vehicles sampled included two backhoes, one tractor, a crane, an excavator, two front loaders, two bulldozers, an air compressor, and a power generator used in the construction and agricultural activities. For a selected number of these vehicles the emissions were further characterized with wall-flow diesel particle filters (DPFs) and partial-flow DPFs (p-DPFs) installed. Fuel-based EFs presented less variability than time-based emission rates, particularly for the BC. Average baseline EFs in working conditions for BC, NOx, and CO ranged from 0.04 to 5.7, from 12.6 to 81.8, and from 7.9 to 285.7 g/kg-fuel, respectively, and a high dependency by operation mode and by vehicle type was observed. Measurement-base frequency distributions of EFs by operation mode are proposed as an alternative method for characterizing the variability of off-road vehicles emissions under real-world conditions. Mass-based reductions for black carbon EFs were substantially large (above 99%) when DPFs were installed and the vehicles were idling, and the reductions were moderate (in the 20\u201360% range) for p-DPFs in working operating conditions. The observed high variability in measured EFs also indicates the need for detailed vehicle operation data for accurately estimating emissions from off-road vehicles in emissions inventories. Implications: Measurements of off-road vehicles used in construction and agricultural activities in Mexico using on-board portable emissions measurements systems (PEMS) showed that these vehicles can be major sources of black carbon and NOX. Emission factors varied significantly under real-world operating conditions, suggesting the need for detailed vehicle operation data for accurately estimating emissions inventories. Tests conducted in a selected number of sampled vehicles indicated that diesel particle filters (DPFs) are an effective technology for control of diesel particulate emissions and can provide potentially large emissions reduction in Mexico if widely implemented.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "74d85fce0a95d2de2464c8f58add0177c3c69ca7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2047447371", "DOI": "10.1366/0003702001950526", "CorpusId": 59136063}, "title": "Angle-Resolved Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometry for Depth Profiling of Coated Materials", "abstract": "The combination of angle-resolved laser ablation with the use of a collimated beam is presented as a new approach to increase the depth-resolved capabilities of laser-induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS).

This work also exemplifies the utilization of field emission-scanning electron microscope (FE\u2013SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and x-ray diffraction (XRD) to reveal the speciation and possible reaction pathway in a very complex adsorption and redox reaction process. Experimentally, ZVIN of this study was prepared by sodium borohydride reduction method at room temperature and ambient pressure. The morphology of as-synthesized ZVIN shows that the nearly ball and ultrafine particles ranged of 20\u201350 nm were observed with FE\u2013SEM or TEM analysis. The kinetic model of nitrites or nitrates reductive reaction by ZVIN is proposed as a pseudo first-order kinetic equation. The nitrite and nitrate removal efficiencies using ZVIN were found 65\u201383% and 51\u201368%, respectively, based on three different initial concentrations. Based on the XRD pattern analyses, it is found that the quantitative relationship between nitrite and Fe(III) or Fe(II) is similar to the one between nitrate and Fe(III) in the ZVIN study. The possible reason is due to the faster nitrite reduction by ZVIN. In fact, the occurrence of the relative faster nitrite reductive reaction suggested that the passivation of the ZVIN have a significant contribution to iron corrosion. The extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) or x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra show that the nitrites or nitrates reduce to N2 or NH3 while oxidizing the ZVIN to Fe2O3 or Fe3O4 electrochemically.

Lack of consistent monitoring data on ambient air toxics makes it difficult to assess the extent of low\u2010level, chronic, ambient exposures to HAPs that could affect human health, and limits attempts to prioritize and evaluate policy initiatives for emissions reduction. Modeled outdoor HAP concentration estimates from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Cumulative Exposure Project were used to characterize the extent of the air toxics problem in California for the base year of 1990. These air toxics concentration estimates were used with chronic toxicity data to estimate cancer and noncancer hazards for individual HAPs and the risks posed by multiple pollutants. Although hazardous air pollutants are ubiquitous in the environment, potential cancer and noncancer health hazards posed by ambient exposures are geographically concentrated in three urbanized areas and in a few rural counties. This analysis estimated a median excess individual cancer risk of 2.7E\u22124 for all air toxics concentrations and 8600 excess lifetime cancer cases, 70% of which were attributable to four pollutants: polycyclic organic matter, 1,3 butadiene, formaldehyde, and benzene. For noncancer effects, the analysis estimated a total hazard index representing the combined effect of all HAPs considered. Each pollutant contributes to the index a ratio of estimated concentration to reference concentration. The median value of the index across census tracts was 17, due primarily to acrolein and chromium concentration estimates. On average, HAP concentrations and cancer and noncancer health risks originate mostly from area and mobile source emissions, although there are several locations in the state where point sources account for a large portion of estimated concentrations and health risks.

The characteristics of coalitions to geoengineer climate are modeled using a \u2018global thermostat setting game\u2019 based on climate model results. Coalition members have incentives to exclude non-members that would prevent implementation of solar geoengineering at a level that is optimal for the existing coalition.

However, for the new gas metal arc welding hazards variants, especially cold metal transfer, there is no data available concerning fumes and gases emissions. This paper attempts to point out ways of reducing the harmful effects of gas metal arc welding processes using different filler materials, different shielding gases, different operational welding procedures and three welding processes: gas metal arc welding process and two variants, pulsed gas metal arc welding and cold metal transfer. The effect of nitrogen oxide addition to the shielding gas composition on the amount of welding fumes and gaseous emissions produced during welding is also analysed. The amount of fume and gases generated during welding was measured over a range of current intensity and arc voltages, using the standard procedures contained in EN ISO 15011-2 [1]. The data presented give a summary of the different gas metal arc welding variants and their relations to fume generation rates and gases emitted. The results obtained give indications on measures to be taken in order to reduce fume and gas emissions.

We construct an optimization model to study these factors by determining optimal design of conventional vehicles (CVs), hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), PHEVs, and BEVs and optimal allocation of vehicle designs and charging infrastructure in the fleet for minimum lifecycle GHG emissions over a range of scenarios. We focus on vehicles with similar size and acceleration to a Toyota Prius under urban EPA driving conditions.

The hysteresis loop shows a distortion with a sudden reduction in the rate of magnetisation (dB/dH ) before approaching the maximum magnetic flux density indicating surface hardening. The systematic changes in the MBE profile for different voltages applied during induction heating indicate the microstructural variations within the case. A single peak MBE profile for a fully martensitic structure gradually changes into two peaks on reducing the induction hardening voltage indicating the formation of an additional soft ferrite phase within the case. The systematic changes in the two MBE peak heights indicate the synergistic decrease in the volume fraction of martensite and the increase in the volume fraction of ferrite phase within the case due to reduction in the induction hardening voltage. The changes in the MBE profile for different case depth specimens are more prominent than the hysteresis loop. This study shows that the MBE alone gives better insight in evaluating the induction hardened components (having case depth \u22721\u00b75 mm), since the height and position of the two MBE peaks are directly influenced by the volume fraction and composition of hard and soft phases within the case.

The differences in points of departure result in distinctly different base levels of CO2 emissions ranging from almost stable CO2 emissions to a continuous growth. Several cases with a range of CO2 emission taxes have also been calculated to identify cost-effective strategies for CO2 emission reduction and to assess the potential contribution of energy technologies and sectors to CO2 reduction. It appears that energy efficiency improvements have the highest potential to contribute to CO2 emission reduction.

Alternatively, the complexes (6-9) in Category II have large counter anions and two dppb ligands asymmetrically coordinated to Au(I) atom, and display a yellow or yellow orange phosphorescence. The difference in the phosphorescence color of the complexes between the Category I and II is ascribed to the change in the structure of the cationic moiety in the complex.

By cyclic voltammetry it is shown that the redox chemistry of the three subunits of triad 6 behave almost independently, indicating no electronic coupling between the subunits in the ground state. Triad 6 exhibits three accessible redox states with one oxidation and two reduction waves due to the formation of the phenothiazine radical cation and isoalloxazine and pyrene radical anions. UV/Vis/NIR spectroelectrochemistry reveals the generation of the protonated isoalloxazine dianion on reduction which is formed in the non-polar solvent in a reduction\u2013protonation\u2013reduction step (two-electron transfer process) and which is attributed to intermolecular proton transfer from the amide group to the electrochemically reduced isoalloxazine radical anion. Evidences for the photoinduced energy and electron transfer within the triad are provided by steady state and time-resolved absorption and fluorescence measurements. Spectroscopic studies displayed that upon excitation the pyrene emission was dramatically quenched in the dyad 4. This is most likely due to the energy transfer from pyrene to the isoalloxazine units as the absorption band of isoalloxazine overlaps with the pyrene emission band leading most likely to a CT state of the isoalloxazine/phenothiazine type. Quenching of the phenothiazine fluorescence in triad 6 was also ascribed to the spectroscopic overlap between the emission spectrum of phenothiazine and absorption spectrum of isoalloxazine. Again, photoinduced electron transfer from phenothiazine to isoalloxazine is expected to be the cause for the quenching of the isoalloxazine emission in the dyad 5.

Comparison with other regions, as well as with automobile ownership and use suggests that road transport the emissions in this region are closely connected to high automobile ownership and use. Examination of detailed estimates of vehicle stocks, use and fuel intensity as well as data from four large metropolises in the region confirms this suggestion. The same data show that it is cars that are the main reason for congestion, high levels of air pollution, and other transport related externalities in urban regions. Thus mitigation of CO2 emissions from urban transport means dealing directly with cars and car use. Widely cited projections of car ownership and use in 2030 suggest that car use will more than triple. Even with a 20% reduction in fuel use and emissions/km, CO2 emissions will be well above present levels. But if the fundamental problems of urban transport that plague Latin America today are addressed, car use will grow by considerably less, restraining CO2 emissions considerably as a co-benefit of transport strategies. A review of the impact of a BRT project in Mexico City shows a reduction of 10% in traffic-related emissions in the BRT corridor even without fuel and emissions being addressed directly. One third of those savings arose because Metrobus riders left cars at home and took the bus. The monetized value of the CO2 externality is small compared to other benefits of Metrobus as a transport project. Thus CO2 reduction can be evaluated as a co-benefit of a transport project. Confronting other large transport externalities such as congestion would likely lead to reductions in car use and greater use of other modes. Thus we argue that CO2 should be treated as a symptom of transport problems, particularly high rates of car use.

The method that 20% of total reducing gas in volume fraction is blasted through normal inlet (NI) while the rest through down pipe inlet (PI) rather than deadman inlet (DI) could apparently improve gas flow in the inactive zone located near the bottom direct reduced iron (DRI) outlet, thus increasing DRI reduction degree to 61% under present calculation conditions.

The total reduction of PM10 emissions associated to each scenario vary between 6 ton.year-1 (scenario 2) and 8 ton.year-1 (scenario 1), or 25% and 34% less emissions. In terms of NOxemission reductions vary between 6 ton.year-1 (scenario 2) and 57 ton.year-1 (scenario 1), or 1% and 7% less emissions. The Lisbon LEZ is therefore much more efficient in reducing PM10 emissions compared to NOx. Major reduction in PM10 and NOx emissions are to be expected with a moderate intervention in the (relatively old) taxi fleet in Lisbon while for passenger cars the impact is limited.

We demonstrate the dramatic reduction of trap-induced photobleaching effects on the common single molecule fluorescence dye Cy3, which is highly susceptible to this destructive pathway. The extension in characteristic fluorophore longevity, a 20-fold improvement when compared to simultaneous exposure to both beams, prolongs the fluorescence emission to several tens of seconds in a combined, coincident arrangement.

Such improvement permits the simultaneous measurement of the mechanical state of a system with optical tweezers and the localization of molecular changes with single molecule fluorescence, as demonstrated by mechanically unzipping a 15-basepair DNA segment labeled with Cy3.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "fdbbbb6d65974d59169de551d6f0364b219bdba6", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3024188311", "DOI": "10.1007/s11356-020-09116-1", "CorpusId": 218652408, "PubMed": "32415443"}, "title": "Socioeconomic factors of industrial air pollutants in Zhejiang Province, China: Decoupling and Decomposition analysis", "abstract": "In order to analyze and control air pollutant emissions effectively, on the basis of comprehensive consideration of three different pollution sources of industrial sulfur dioxide, industrial nitrogen oxides, and industrial smoke and dust, the Tapio decoupling model and LMDI decomposition model with six decomposition variables are constructed to compare the effects of socioeconomic factors on industrial air pollutant emissions in 11 cities in Zhejiang Province during 2006\u20132017. Then, a decoupling effort model is developed to analyze the effectiveness of the decoupling efforts taken at city level. This study found that (1) during the period of 2006\u20132017, the air pollutant emission reduction work in Zhejiang Province achieved remarkable results. More specifically, economic scale effect and population effect are the main factors for the increase of air pollutant emissions. And, the energy emission intensity effect and technological progress are the main driving forces for the reduction of three atmospheric pollutants, followed by the reduction effect of industrial structure and energy structure. (2) The environmental pollution problems of different air pollution sources in different cities are heterogeneous. (3) Eleven cities in Zhejiang Province have made significant decoupling efforts on the emission of three kinds of air pollutants, but there are some differences in the trend of the decoupling effort index of different pollution sources in different cities. In the future, illustrating by the example of Zhejiang, we should implement a \u201ccommon but different\u201d emission reduction strategy and emphasize pollutant emissions control during energy use in the efforts of further promoting the reduction of air pollutants.", "year": 2020}, {"paperId": "3dc3c62108328fb6aeaee68562a6d890c9ddbb68", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2020450945", "DOI": "10.1007/s11252-008-0051-1", "CorpusId": 25886135}, "title": "The energy and mass balance of Los Angeles County", "abstract": "We conducted an urban \u201cmetabolic\u201d study of inputs and outputs of food, water, energy, and pollutants from Los Angeles County, USA. This region has been the subject of recent debate about the nature of population density and distribution as it relates to urban form and associated environmental impacts. We found that with the exception of food imports and wastewater outputs, inputs of resources and outputs of pollutants generally declined on a per capita basis from 1990 to 2000. Reductions likely reflected a combination of changes in public policy, improvements in technology and public infrastructure, and impacts of increases in population density. However, in comparison to other municipalities and urban regions, resource consumption per capita was still relatively high in some categories, particularly inputs of water and transportation energy. Per capita greenhouse gas emissions were lower in Los Angeles County than for the average of the USA as a whole but higher than previous analyses of urban areas internationally, largely due to comparatively high emissions from the transportation sector. Wastewater discharge accounted for less than 40% of water inputs excluding precipitation; however the partitioning of water outputs through other potential losses, specifically evapotranspiration, runoff, and groundwater recharge, remains highly uncertain. We suggest that more detailed information about water losses will greatly improve future mass and energy accounting for analyses of urban environmental sustainability in this semi-arid region.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "84f7da5ebf8f5a78f1a6028801a8f256576b63ed", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2319215546", "DOI": "10.1021/es202007b", "CorpusId": 20082493, "PubMed": "22132818"}, "title": "Characterization of economic requirements for a \"carbon-debt-free country\".", "abstract": "In recent years, greenhouse gas emission controls that incorporate the supply chains of products and services, thereby emphasizing the role of consumers rather than producers, have been drawing increasing attention. A country's consumption-based emissions, including those due to global supply chains, reflect the total emissions on which the national economy relies. To design effective emissions control strategies there is therefore an urgent need for countries to elucidate the structural relationship between their domestic economy and emissions occurring through global supply chains. Here we consider the structural characteristics of consumption-based emissions in Japan, which in 2005 totaled 1675 Mt CO(2)eq. Outside the country the Japanese economy generated global emissions of 541 Mt CO(2)eq, 35.7% of which were UNFCCC Annex I emissions and 64.3% were non-Annex I and other emissions. This figure of 64.3% reveals that Japan is actually relying to a considerable degree on emissions that are subject to no international obligations. We identify key economic contributors to consumption-based emissions at the commodity level and specify items of household expenditure that are effective options for both financial savings and emissions reduction. We then discuss the importance of emissions control for evolving toward a \"carbon-debt-free country\".", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "390a9c78fd080a794c8011422152e4c5654bfb7c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2015288140", "DOI": "10.1109/VPPC.2006.364288", "CorpusId": 422043}, "title": "Noise Reduction Control Strategies for Switched Reluctance Drives", "abstract": "The usage of switched reluctance machines (SRMs) in acoustically critical applications like vehicles requires low noise emissions.

The new look of early-type galaxies and surrounding fields disclosed by extremely deep optical images", "abstract": "Galactic archaeology based on star counts is instrumental to reconstruct the past mass assembly of Local Group galaxies. The development of new observing techniques and data reduction, coupled with the use of sensitive large field of view cameras, now allows us to pursue this technique in more distant galaxies exploiting their diffuse low surface brightness (LSB) light. As part of the ATLAS^(3D) project, we have obtained with the MegaCam camera at the Canada\u2013France\u2013Hawaii Telescope extremely deep, multiband images of nearby early-type galaxies (ETGs). We present here a catalogue of 92 galaxies from the ATLAS^(3D) sample, which are located in low- to medium-density environments. The observing strategy and data reduction pipeline, which achieve a gain of several magnitudes in the limiting surface brightness with respect to classical imaging surveys, are presented. The size and depth of the survey are compared to other recent deep imaging projects. The paper highlights the capability of LSB-optimized surveys at detecting new prominent structures that change the apparent morphology of galaxies. The intrinsic limitations of deep imaging observations are also discussed, among those, the contamination of the stellar haloes of galaxies by extended ghost reflections, and the cirrus emission from Galactic dust. The detection and systematic census of fine structures that trace the present and past mass assembly of ETGs are one of the prime goals of the project. We provide specific examples of each type of observed structures \u2013 tidal tails, stellar streams and shells \u2013 and explain how they were identified and classified. We give an overview of the initial results. The detailed statistical analysis will be presented in future papers.", "year": 2014}]}
