Measurement of regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMR(glc)) using PET and [(18)F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) has become a standard technique in both oncology and dementia research. When measuring rCMR(glc) in Alzheimer's disease (AD), characteristic reductions in rCMR(glc) are found in neocortical association areas including the posterior cingulate, precuneus, temporoparietal and frontal multimodal association regions; the primary visual cortex, sensorimotor cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellum are relatively unaffected. FDG-PET has been used in the study of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to accurately predict the subsequent decline to AD. Impairment in rCMR(glc) may be seen in individuals at high genetic risk of AD, even before clinical symptoms are apparent. Characteristic patterns of regional hypometabolism are also seen in other degenerative dementias such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The use of different radioisotopes and tracers increases the versatility of PET. Tracers adopted in dementia research include (11)C-PK-11195 and (11)C-PIB, which have been used to investigate neuroinflammation and amyloid deposition, respectively, in both AD and MCI populations. It is also possible to investigate neurotransmitter systems in dementia; targets have included the cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. Imaging the brains of dementia patients using PET provides important information about the brain function of these individuals that would otherwise be unavailable with other imaging modalities.

Using blended cements reduces the embodied greenhouse gas emissions; however, little attention has been paid to the reduction in CO2 capture (carbonation) and durability. The aim of this study is to determine if the reduction in production emissions of blended cements compensates for the reduced durability and CO2 capture.MethodsThis study evaluates CO2 emissions and CO2 capture for a reinforced concrete column during its service life and after demolition and reuse as gravel filling material. Concrete depletion, due to carbonation and the unavoidable steel embedded corrosion, is studied, as this process consequently ends the concrete service life. Carbonation deepens progressively during service life and captures CO2 even after demolition due to the greater exposed surface area. In this study, results are presented as a function of cement replaced by fly ash (FA) and blast furnace slag (BFS).Results and discussionConcrete made with Portland cement, FA (35\u00a0% FA), and BFS blended cements (80\u00a0% BFS) captures 47, 41, and 20\u00a0% of CO2 emissions, respectively. The service life of blended cements with high amounts of cement replacement, like CEM III/A (50\u00a0% BFS), CEM III/B (80\u00a0% BFS), and CEM II/B-V (35\u00a0% FA), was about 10\u00a0% shorter, given the higher carbonation rate coefficient. Compared to Portland cement and despite the reduced CO2 capture and service life, CEM III/B emitted 20\u00a0% less CO2 per year.ConclusionsTo obtain reliable results in a life cycle assessment, it is crucial to consider carbonation during use and after demolition. Replacing Portland cement with FA, instead of BFS, leads to a lower material emission factor, since FA needs less processing after being collected, and transport distances are usually shorter. However, greater reductions were achieved using BFS, since a larger amount of cement can be replaced. Blended cements emit less CO2 per year during the life cycle of a structure, although a high cement replacement reduces the service life notably. If the demolished concrete is crushed and recycled as gravel filling material, carbonation can cut CO2 emissions by half. A case study is presented in this paper demonstrating how the results may be utilized.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "818828c89bf4172ce06a4591e7fd44567a18fb21", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2022524862", "DOI": "10.1029/2001JD001289", "CorpusId": 140667910}, "title": "Global soil-biogenic NOx emissions and the role of canopy processes", "abstract": "[1]\u00a0Soils are an important though uncertain source of oxidized nitrogen (NOx) to the atmosphere. One of the main uncertainties in the source estimates is the role of the canopy interactions between NOx emissions, dry deposition, turbulence, and chemistry. Previous studies, in which only dry deposition has been considered, indicate a reduction of about 50% of the globally emitted NOx by soils. We have implemented a multilayer trace gas exchange model in a chemistry general circulation model to explicitly calculate the role of canopy interactions in regulating the effective NOx emissions to the atmosphere. Our new NOx emission algorithm interactively calculates a global soil emission flux of about 12 Tg N yr\u22121. For a sensitivity analysis we have also included a fixed global soil NOx emissions inventory of about 21 Tg N yr\u22121. It appears that the enhancement of NOx and O3 concentrations in response to the soil emission flux is suppressed by the compensating effect of dry deposition. For sites that are exposed to relatively large emission fluxes, our multilayer and the previously used big leaf approach, which does not consider canopy interactions, calculate similar surface NOx fluxes. This confirms the validity of the big leaf approach for most polluted regions at midlatitudes. However, for relatively pristine sites in the subtropics and tropics, where NOx is a limiting factor in ozone and hydroxyl chemistry, there are distinct differences between the multilayer and big leaf NOx surface fluxes. This justifies the use of more comprehensive atmosphere-biosphere exchange descriptions in global models.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "fd0c8379d06df08cbcef93cb4a0f165e797d2ff4", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2168658095", "DOI": "10.1046/J.1526-0984.2001.008003187.X", "CorpusId": 110269196}, "title": "Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions through CO2 EOR in Texas", "abstract": "Energy and environmental questions no longer need to have conflicting perspectives. Solutions to problems in both arenas can satisfy multiple objectives. This paper explores the technical feasibility and economic potential of capturing CO2 from coal- or lignite-fired utility boilers and applying the CO2 to enhance oil recovery in the mature oil provinces of Texas. This capture accomplishes two goals: sequestering a substantial amount of CO2 for an extended period and increasing the efficiency of oil recovery. Previous research has indicated that a primary target of enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is estimated at 74 billion stock- tank barrels (BSTB) of residual oil. The present study finds that 8 BSTB of this resource is within a 145-km (90-mile) radius of the candidate coal- or lignite-fired plants in Texas. Modeling conducted in this study indicates that CO2 flooding can produce oil that would otherwise not be recovered, at an incremental cost of between $6.00 and $16.00/STB. In addition, probably between 12 and 20 years of CO2 production from the candidate lignite- or coal-fired boilers can be sequestered from these generation facilities. Preliminary analyses indicate that CO2 capture for lignite- and coal-fired plants in Texas may be cost-effective when compared with fuel switching these same boilers to natural gas. From a policy standpoint, it may be desirable to encourage CO2 capture retrofit initially, as opposed to fuel switching, because the former results in overall lower levels of CO2 emissions at a comparable cost. In conclusion, there is substantial potential for using utility plant boiler effluent as a CO2 supply source for flooding and using mature oil reservoirs for CO2 sequestration. Development of this potential resource base may be facilitated by further research and regulatory initiatives.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "fc28b0504278dd230291b2d94ebaa5963d4ce6ee", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1971216838", "DOI": "10.1002/ana.1133", "CorpusId": 3235463, "PubMed": "11558792"}, "title": "Alzheimer's disease versus dementia with Lewy bodies: Cerebral metabolic distinction with autopsy confirmation", "abstract": "Seeking antemortem markers to distinguish Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), we examined brain glucose metabolism of DLB and AD.

The statistical distribution of storm intensities is virtually preserved under climate change using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B scenario until the end of this century.

Strong decreases in G V attributable to diurnal water stress were accompanied by a significant reduction in total monoterpenoid emission rate in midday. However, various monoterpenoids responded differently to the reduction in G V, with the emission rates of limonene and trans-\u03b2-ocimene being unaffected but those of linalool and 1,8-cineole closely following diurnal variability in G V. A dynamic emission model indicated that stomatal sensitivity of emissions was associated with monoterpenoid Henry's law constant (H, gas/liquid phase partition coefficient). Monoterpenoids with a large Hsuch as trans-\u03b2-ocimene sustain higher intercellular partial pressure for a certain liquid phase concentration, and stomatal closure is balanced by a nearly immediate increase in monoterpene diffusion gradient from intercellular air-space to ambient air. The partial pressure rises also in compounds with a low H, but more than 1,000-fold higher liquid phase concentrations of linalool and 1,8-cineole are necessary to increase intercellular partial pressure high enough to balance stomatal closure. The system response is accordingly slower, and the emission rates may be transiently suppressed by low G V. Simulations further suggested that linalool and 1,8-cineole synthesis rates also decreased with decreasing G V, possibly as the result of selective inhibition of various monoterpene synthases by stomata. We conclude that physicochemical characteristics of volatiles not only affect total emission but also alter the fractional composition of emitted monoterpenoids.", "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "11299cbc552d3e1c75293e194cbcc05be8bfa77e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1963542759", "DOI": "10.5547/01956574.36.2.8", "CorpusId": 154137554}, "title": "Leakage from sub-national climate policy: The case of Californias capandtrade program", "abstract": "With federal policies to curb carbon emissions stagnating in the U.S., California is taking action alone.

Gas exchange and biochemical measurements were concurrently taken. Isoprene emission was lower in the plants growing at ele- vated CO 2 than in those growing at ambient CO 2 . Isoprene emission and isoprene synthase activity (IsoS) were very low in plants growing at the bottom of the spring under very rich CO 2 and increased at increasing distance from the spring (and decreasing CO 2 concentration). Distance from the spring did not significantly affect photosynthesis mak- ing it therefore unlikely that there is carbon limitation to isoprene formation. The isoprene emission rate was very quickly reduced after rapid switches from elevated to ambi- ent CO 2 in the gas-exchange cuvette, whereas it increased when switching from ambient to elevated CO 2 . The rapidity of the response may be consistent with post-translational modifications of enzymes in the biosynthetic pathway of isoprene formation. Reduction of IsoS activity is inter- preted as a long-term response. Basal emission of isoprene was not constant over the day but showed a diurnal course opposite to photosynthesis, with a peak during the hottest hours of the day, independent of stomatal conductance and probably dependent on external air temperature or tempo- rary reduction of CO 2 concentration.

The results show that, from 2013 to 2016, CO2 and atmospheric pollutants achieved emission reduction synergistically through ETS, among which the synergistic emission reduction effect between CO2 and SO2 was most significant. Compared with the direct category, the indirect category accounted for smaller proportion of the synergistic emission reduction effect.

Recent research has shown that the warming of earth by the increasing concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is partially countered by some backscattering to space of solar radiation by the sulfate particles, which act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby influence the micro-physical and optical properties of clouds, affecting regional precipitation patterns, and increasing cloud albedo (e.g., Rosenfeld, 2000; Ramanathan et al., 2001; Ramaswamy et al., 2001).

According to the World Health Organization, the pollution particles affect health and lead to more than 500,000 premature deaths per year worldwide (Nel, 2005). Through acid precipitation and deposition, SO2 and sulfates also cause various kinds of ecological damage. This creates a dilemma for environmental policy makers, because the required emission reductions of SO2, and also anthropogenic organics (except black carbon), as dictated by health and ecological considerations, add to global warming and associated negative consequences, such as sea level rise, caused by the greenhouse gases. In fact, after earlier rises, global SO2 emissions and thus sulfate loading have been declining at the rate of 2.7% per year, potentially explaining the observed reverse from dimming to brightening in surface solar radiation at many stations worldwide (Wild et al., 2005). The corresponding increase in solar radiation by 0.10% per year from 1983 to 2001 (Pinker et al., 2005) contributed to the observed climate warming during the past decade.

We use a 3D chemistry climate model, fed by aerosol size distributions from a zonal mean aerosol model, to simulate continuous injection of 1\u201310\u00a0Mt/a into the lower tropical stratosphere. In contrast to the case for all previous work, the particles are predicted to grow to larger sizes than are observed after volcanic eruptions. The reason is the continuous supply of sulfuric acid and hence freshly formed small aerosol particles, which enhance the formation of large aerosol particles by coagulation and, to a lesser extent, by condensation. Owing to their large size, these particles have a reduced albedo. Furthermore, their sedimentation results in a non-linear relationship between stratospheric aerosol burden and annual injection, leading to a reduction of the targeted cooling. More importantly, the sedimenting particles heat the tropical cold point tropopause and, hence, the stratospheric entry mixing ratio of H2O increases. Therefore, geoengineering by means of sulfate aerosols is predicted to accelerate the hydroxyl catalyzed ozone destruction cycles and cause a significant depletion of the ozone layer even though future halogen concentrations will be significantly reduced.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "578d32892f680c6c7a43b29df0becfbc6dc02174", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2111157325", "DOI": "10.4209/AAQR.2015.03.0140", "CorpusId": 96804598}, "title": "Emission Reductions of Nitrogen Oxides, Particulate Matter and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons by Using Microalgae Biodiesel, Butanol and Water in Diesel Engine", "abstract": "The transport sector is a major consumer of fossil fuels especially petroleum diesel, which is used to power diesel engines used on-road and off-road in trucks, tractors, passenger cars as well as marine vessels.

Conversely, the diesel engine is a major source of both criteria and non-criteria air pollutants, which contribute to the deteriorating air quality thereby putting the health of mankind at risk.

All diesel blends showed higher BSFCs and BTEs compared to regular petroleum diesel, whereby BT20W0.5 had the highest BSFC and BT15B2 had the best performance in terms of BTE. Among the diesel blends, only 2% microalgae added to diesel blends increased the NOx emissions by about 2%, while for the addition of 10\u201320% butanol fractions and 0.5% water fractions resulted in lower NOx emissions by about 12\u201328%, when compared to petroleum diesel. All the diesel blends considered in this study showed PM reductions ranging between 22.4% for B2 and 60.4% for BT15W0.5%, while reductions of PAH emissions were ranging from 6.5% for B2 to 22.76% for BT20W0.5. On the other hand, only the use of 2% microalgae biodiesel showed reductions in CO emissions of about 0.34% and 1.01% for B2 and BT20B2 blends, respectively, while other diesel blends showed increased CO emissions of about 1.72\u20132.94% in comparison to CO emissions of diesel fuel emissions. The addition of higher butanol fractions of 20% increased the HC emission factors by approximately 18% and 70%, while the HC emission factors for biodiesel, 10\u201315% butanol fractions and 0.5% water additions lead to reductions in emission by about 8\u201350%.

Combustion of fuels in the residential sector for cooking and heating results in the emission of aerosol and aerosol precursors impacting air quality, human health, and climate. Residential emissions are dominated by the combustion of solid fuels. We use a global aerosol microphysics model to simulate the impact of residential fuel combustion on atmospheric aerosol for the year 2000. The model underestimates black carbon (BC) and organic carbon (OC) mass concentrations observed over Asia, Eastern Europe, and Africa, with better prediction when carbonaceous emissions from the residential sector are doubled. Observed seasonal variability of BC and OC concentrations are better simulated when residential emissions include a seasonal cycle. The largest contributions of residential emissions to annual surface mean particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations are simulated for East Asia, South Asia, and Eastern Europe. We use a concentration response function to estimate the human health impact due to long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 from residential emissions. We estimate global annual excess adult (>\u2009\u202f30\u00a0years of age) premature mortality (due to both cardiopulmonary disease and lung cancer) to be 308\u202f000 (113\u202f300\u2013497\u202f000, 5th to 95th percentile uncertainty range) for monthly varying residential emissions and 517\u202f000 (192\u202f000\u2013827\u202f000) when residential carbonaceous emissions are doubled. Mortality due to residential emissions is greatest in Asia, with China and India accounting for 50\u202f% of simulated global excess mortality. Using an offline radiative transfer model we estimate that residential emissions exert a global annual mean direct radiative effect between \u221266 and +21\u202fmW\u202fm\u22122, with sensitivity to the residential emission flux and the assumed ratio of BC, OC, and SO2 emissions. Residential emissions exert a global annual mean first aerosol indirect effect of between \u221252 and \u221216\u202fmW\u202fm\u22122, which is sensitive to the assumed size distribution of carbonaceous emissions.

Activity data was collected from three sectors, building and energy use, travel and procurement. Published emissions factors were applied to this data to provide figures in carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2eq).ResultsThe carbon footprint for one cataract operation was 181.8\u2009kg CO2eq. On the basis that 2230 patients were treated for cataracts during 2011 in Cardiff, this has an associated carbon footprint of 405.4 tonnes CO2eq.

We study the effect of those regulations by applying the emission estimate algorithm DECSO (Daily Emission estimates Constrained by Satellite Observations) to measurements of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). We improved DECSO by updating the chemical transport model CHIMERE from v2006 to v2013 and by adding an Observation minus Forecast (OmF) criterion to filter outlying satellite retrievals due to high aerosol concentrations. The comparison of model results with both ground and satellite observations indicates that CHIMERE v2013 is better performing than CHIMERE v2006. After filtering the satellite observations with high aerosol loads that were leading to large OmF values, unrealistic jumps in the emission estimates are removed. Despite the cloudy conditions during the YOG we could still see a decrease of tropospheric NO2 column concentrations of about 32 % in the OMI observations when compared to the average NO2 columns from 2005 to 2012. The results of the improved DECSO algorithm for NOx emissions show a reduction of at least 25 % during the YOG period and afterwards. This indicates that air quality regulations taken by the local government have an effect in reducing NOx emissions. The algorithm is also able to detect an emission reduction of 10 % during the Chinese Spring Festival. This study demonstrates the capacity of the DECSO algorithm to capture the change of NOx emissions on a monthly scale. We also show that the observed NO2 columns and the derived emissions show different patterns that provide complimentary information. For example, the Nanjing smog episode in December 2013 led to a strong increase in NO2 concentrations without an increase in NOx emissions. Furthermore, DECSO gives us important information on the non-trivial seasonal relation between NOx emissions and NO2 concentrations on a local scale.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "d17e49816ac48aaa2f10dee17bcb1f8326c8e26f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1997729511", "DOI": "10.2174/1874331500903010006", "CorpusId": 14920805}, "title": "Air treatment techniques for abatement of emissions from intensive livestock production", "abstract": "Intensive livestock production is connected with a number of environmental effects, including emissions of ammonia (NH3), greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O), odour, and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5). Possible strategies for emission reduction include feed management, adaptation of housing design, and, in case of mechanically ventilated animal houses, the application of end-of-pipe air treatment, viz acid scrubbers and bioscrubbers. Air treatment techniques can achieve very high emission reductions (up to 100% ammonia removal for acid scrubbers). Furthermore, air treatment offers the possibility to achieve removal of not just one compound but of a combined removal of a variety of pollutants (ammonia, odour and particulate matter) at the same time. The successful application of scrubbers is of increasing impor- tance as intensive livestock operations have to comply with ever stricter regulations and emission limits. Research is needed to address topics such as reduction of costs (both investment and operational costs), improvement of process con- trol to guarantee stable removal efficiencies, decrease of N2O production in bioscrubbers, and increase of odour removal efficiency. 1 Ammonia emission contributes minimally to odour emission because the odour threshold of ammonia is relatively high, viz 5 ppm (3), which is un- likely to be found outside animal houses.

We performed anoxic incubations using freshly collected sediment, along with water samples harvested from a tropical wetland, amended with 13C-methane (0.67 atm) to test the capacity of its microbial community to perform anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) linked to the reduction of the humic fraction of its NOM. Collected evidence demonstrates that electron-accepting functional groups (e.g., quinones) present in NOM fueled AOM by serving as a terminal electron acceptor. Indeed, while sulfate reduction was the predominant process, accounting for up to 42.5% of the AOM activities, the microbial reduction of NOM concomitantly occurred. Furthermore, enrichment of wetland sediment with external NOM provided a complementary electron-accepting capacity, of which reduction accounted for \u223c100 nmol 13CH4 oxidized \u00b7 cm\u22123 \u00b7 day\u22121. Spectroscopic evidence showed that quinone moieties were heterogeneously distributed in the wetland sediment, and their reduction occurred during the course of AOM. Moreover, an enrichment derived from wetland sediments performing AOM linked to NOM reduction stoichiometrically oxidized methane coupled to the reduction of the humic analogue anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate. Microbial populations potentially involved in AOM coupled to microbial reduction of NOM were dominated by divergent biota from putative AOM-associated archaea. We estimate that this microbial process potentially contributes to the suppression of up to 114 teragrams (Tg) of CH4 \u00b7 year\u22121 in coastal wetlands and more than 1,300 Tg \u00b7 year\u22121, considering the global wetland area. IMPORTANCE The identification of key processes governing methane emissions from natural systems is of major importance considering the global warming effects triggered by this greenhouse gas. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) coupled to the microbial reduction of distinct electron acceptors plays a pivotal role in mitigating methane emissions from ecosystems. Given their high organic content, wetlands constitute the largest natural source of atmospheric methane. Nevertheless, processes controlling methane emissions in these environments are poorly understood. Here, we provide tracer analysis with 13CH4 and spectroscopic evidence revealing that AOM linked to the microbial reduction of redox functional groups in natural organic matter (NOM) prevails in a tropical wetland. We suggest that microbial reduction of NOM may largely contribute to the suppression of methane emissions from tropical wetlands. This is a novel avenue within the carbon cycle in which slowly decaying NOM (e.g., humic fraction) in organotrophic environments fuels AOM by serving as a terminal electron acceptor.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "8da3b41dfedaa765c6d201d2f76179f097902826", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2102753921", "DOI": "10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/035019", "CorpusId": 29755661}, "title": "Agricultural productivity and greenhouse gas emissions: trade-offs or synergies between mitigation and food security?", "abstract": "In this letter, we investigate the effects of crop yield and livestock feed efficiency scenarios on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from agriculture and land use change in developing countries.

The soot emission process is simulated by a phenomenological soot model that uses a competing formation and oxidation rate formulation. The model is applied to predict the diesel spray lift-off length and its sooting tendency under high temperature and pressure conditions with good agreement with experiments of Sandia. Various nozzle diameters and chamber conditions were investigated. The model successfully predicts that the sooting tendency is reduced as the nozzle diameter is reduced and/or the initial chamber gas temperature is decreased, as observed by the experiments. The model is also applied to simulate diesel engine combustion under PCCI-like conditions. Trends of heat release rate, NOx and soot emissions with respect to EGR levels and start-of-injection timings are also well predicted. Both experiments and models reveal that soot emissions peak when the start of injection occurs close to TDC. The model indicates that low soot emission at early SOI is due to better oxidation while low soot emission at late SOI is due to less formation.

Recent work has examined (and narrowed) these differences through systematic model intercomparison using a high-emissions pathway to highlight the differences. This paper extends that analysis to explore a range of plausible socioeconomic scenarios and emission pathways. Results from multiple climate and economic models are combined to examine the global and regional impacts of climate change on agricultural yields, area, production, consumption, prices and trade for coarse grains, rice, wheat, oilseeds and sugar crops to 2050. We find that climate impacts on global average yields, area, production and consumption are similar across shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP 1, 2 and 3, as we implement them based on population, income and productivity drivers), except when changes in trade policies are included. Impacts on trade and prices are higher for SSP 3 than SSP 2, and higher for SSP 2 than for SSP 1. Climate impacts for all variables are similar across low to moderate emissions pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0), but increase for a higher emissions pathway (RCP 8.5). It is important to note that these global averages may hide regional variations. Projected reductions in agricultural yields due to climate change by 2050 are larger for some crops than those estimated for the past half century, but smaller than projected increases to 2050 due to rising demand and intrinsic productivity growth.

In southern Europe regional climate change leads to increasing surface ozone concentrations during April\u2013September, but projected emission reductions in Europe have a stronger effect, resulting in net reductions of surface ozone concentrations.

Four soil samples from fields of different land use [US (paddy field), China (paddy field) and Belgium (maize and wheat fields)] were incubated as soil suspension (soil:water ratio 1:4) to study the N2O and CH4 emission under different soil redox potential conditions. The results show that the N2O emission was regulated within a narrow redox potential range of +120 to +250\u00a0mV, due to the balance of N2O production and its further reduction to N2. Methane emission occurred below a soil specific redox potential point, and the emission rates were inversely related to soil redox potentials. Both linear and exponential relationships between CH4 emission and the soil redox potential were significant. By extrapolating the linear relationship of CH4 emission against soil redox potential, the critical redox potentials for CH4 production were estimated at about \u2013170 (US paddy soil), \u2013150 (Chinese paddy soil), \u2013215 (Belgian maize soil), and \u2013195\u00a0mV (Belgian wheat soil), respectively. In addition, the results indicate that a soil with a lower critical redox potential for CH4 production had a higher CH4 production potential. In this study, N2O and CH4 emissions were found to occur at a distinctly different soil redox potential condition. The range of soil redox potential values where both N2O and CH4 emissions were low was different for different soils, but it was situated between +120 and \u2013170\u00a0mV.

Such generation systems allow for significant reduction of CO2 emissions compared with a traditional fossil fuel plant. Furthermore, several improvements in power systems network configuration and operation combined with new technologies have enabled reduction of losses and energy demand, thus contributing to reduction of CO2 emissions. Another environmental threat identified in electrical networks is the leaking of insulating sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas used in electrical gas insulated substations (GIS) and equipment. Because of its Global Warming Potential (GWP) of nearly 24,000 and its long life in the atmosphere (over 3000 years), SF6 gas was recognized as a greenhouse gas at the 1997 COP3; since then its use and emissions in the atmosphere have been regulated by international treaties.

We used the new diagnostic outputs to explain the model-predicted sensitivity of P(Ox) to changes in VOC and NOx emissions. We found that the ozone ridgeline, which distinguishes between NOx-limited and radical-limited conditions, is determined by a ridgeline of maximum OH chain length. We examined the radical propagation reactions which affect OH chain length, and we developed four indicators related to radical propagation efficiency: I(HC,NO2) which approximates the fraction of OH that reacts with hydrocarbons; I(NO,RO2) which approximates the fraction of HO2 that reacts with NO; the ratio of [O3]/[NOx] which affects the balance between radical initiation and propagation; and [HO2] which is the dominant term in P(H2O2)/P(HNO3).

An adjoint version of a global transport model has been used to estimate these fluxes at a relatively high spatial and temporal resolution. Measurements from 34 monitoring stations and 11 locations along two ship cruises by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration have been used as input. Recent estimates of methane sources, including a number of minor ones, have been used as a priori constraints. For the target period 1993-1995 our inversion reduces the a priori assumed global methane emissions of 528 to 505 Tg(CH 4 ) yr -1 a posteriori. Further, the relative contribution of the Northern Hemispheric sources decreases from 77% a priori to 67% a posteriori. In addition to making the emission estimate more consistent with the measurements, the inversion helps to reduce the uncertainties in the sources. Uncertainty reductions vary from 75% on the global scale to \u223c1% on the grid-scale (8\u00b0\u00d710\u00b0), indicating that the grid scale variability is not resolved by the measurements. Large scale features such as the interhemispheric methane concentration gradient are relatively well resolved and therefore impose strong constraints on the estimated fluxes. The capability of the model to reproduce this gradient is critically dependent on the accuracy at which the interhemispheric tracer exchange and the large-scale hydroxyl radical distribution are represented. As a consequence, the inversion-derived emission estimates are sensitive to errors in the transport model and the calculated hydroxyl radical distribution. In fact, a considerable contribution of these model errors cannot be ignored. This underscores that source quantification by inverse modeling is limited by the extent to which the rate of interhemispheric transport and the hydroxyl radical distribution can be validated. We show that the use of temporal and spatial correlations of emissions may significantly improve our results; however, at present the experimental support for such correlations is lacking.

N2O emissions outside the cropping period accounted for up to 58% of the annual emissions and were strongly affected by frost-thaw cycles.

In 2010, at more than the half of the urban measurement stations in Germany, annual mean values for NO2 exceeded the new Europe-wide limit value of 40 \u03bcg/m3 (20 ppbv) NO2. Similar findings are reported from many other member states of the European Union.ResultsThe observed trend of the airborne NO2 concentrations has different reasons. Firstly, the NO2/NOx emission ratio has increased significantly during the last two decades. Furthermore, secondary NO2, caused by the titration reactions of NO with ozone (O3) and peroxy radicals (RO2), is responsible for the major fraction (approximately 70%) of the measured NO2. However, secondary NO2 shows a highly nonlinear dependency on NOx and thus, is decreasing much more slowly than expected from the decreasing NOx levels. Based on the results from the present study, the increased NO2/NOX emission ratio can only explain a minor fraction of the observed high airborne NO2 concentration in the city center.ConclusionsA further reduction of primary NO2 emissions, due to improved exhaust gas treatment, will not have a strong influence on urban NO2 levels, and a further significant reduction of the NOX emissions, in particular from vehicular traffic, is necessary in order to meet the annual mean limit value for NO2 of about 20 ppb in the future.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "a4d03b1588eb0ee7bd438419ea220dae711adaab", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2600702845", "DOI": "10.1021/acs.est.6b06430", "CorpusId": 206565989, "PubMed": "28318241"}, "title": "Mitigating Greenhouse Gas and Ammonia Emissions from Swine Manure Management: A System Analysis.", "abstract": "Gaseous emissions from animal manure are considerable contributor to global ammonia (NH3) and agriculture greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Pollution levels will increase in the future due to growth in ship traffic and lack of effective regulations. So far, related research has been concentrated on emissions from land-based sources, and very few shipping emission inventories exist to date. The aim of this study was to evaluate emissions and the technical reduction potential of SO2, NOx, CO, HC and PM from waterborne traffic in Finland and in marine areas near Finland in 2000 and 2015. The energy consumption of ships in 2000 was estimated based on statistics mapping ship movements in the ports of Finland, Russia, Estonia and Sweden. Combined with emission factors, this data was used as a basis for evaluating the total amount of emissions. Emissions in 2015 were calculated based on predicted growth rates in ship traffic and four different reduction technology scenarios. In 2000 the ship-based SO2 and NOx emissions on sea routes totalled 36000 and 107000 tonnes, respectively. Current international regulations have little impact on emission rates in the studied marine areas. The required reduction technologies are internal engine modifications and fuel with a maximum sulphur content of 1.5 %. The results of the scenario study show that ship-based SO2 and NOx emissions will increase by 20 % and 40 % respectively by 2015 if no further emission reduction methods are introduced. These emissions could be reduced significantly through introduction of more effective reduction technologies, such as lowering the sulphur content in fuel, adding water to the engine process, exhaust gas recirculation and selective catalytic reduction technology. The potential is substantial, especially for NOx emissions from cargo ships, which could be reduced by approximately 90 % from the 2015 baseline level.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "2b7a8717e2133fc5d0b6a6663137442651cdeb78", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2064506871", "DOI": "10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2012.04.012", "CorpusId": 154737234}, "title": "CO2 emission reduction within Chinese iron & steel industry: practices, determinants and performance", "abstract": null, "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "cbb3e836dce98bd998a4d36ece3a7be6ddb04f7b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3000067036", "DOI": "10.1021/es403446m", "CorpusId": 2161947, "PubMed": "24187951"}, "title": "The ozone-climate penalty: past, present, and future.", "abstract": "Climate change is expected to increase global mean temperatures leading to higher tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations in already polluted regions, potentially eroding the benefits of expensive emission controls. The magnitude of the \"O3-climate penalty\" has generally decreased over the past three decades, which makes future predictions for climate impacts on air quality uncertain. Researchers attribute historical reductions in the O3-climate penalty to reductions in NOx emissions but have so far not extended this theory into a quantitative prediction for future effects. Here, we show that a three-dimensional air quality model can be used to map the behavior of the O3-climate penalty under varying NOx and VOC emissions in both NOx-limited and NOx-saturated conditions in Central and Southern California, respectively. Simulations suggest that the planned emissions control program for O3 precursors will not diminish the O3-climate penalty to zero as some observational studies might imply. The results further demonstrate that in a NOx-limited air basin, NOx control strategies alone are sufficient to both decrease the O3-climate penalty and mitigate O3 pollution, while in a NOx-saturated air basin, a modified emissions control plan that carefully chooses reductions in both NOx and VOC emissions may be necessary to eliminate the O3-climate penalty while simultaneously reducing base case O3 concentrations to desired levels. Additional modeling is needed to determine the behavior of the O3-climate penalty as NOx and VOC emissions evolve in other regions.", "year": 2013}]}
