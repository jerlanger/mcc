The advantage of such a sectoral approach is that it allows for discussions on worldwide competing sectors and on the role of emission reduction contributions of developing countries. The disadvantage is that the reduction targets are influenced by countries' historical emissions data at the sectoral level, which are, especially for developing countries, uncertain. A major drawback of the analyses of the Triptych approach is that they lack a sensitivity analysis of the effect of using different historical emissions datasets on the allocation of emission allowances. The present article addresses this by analysing and comparing the differences in future emissions allowances under the Triptych approach, using two different historical emissions datasets. For some countries, the differences in historical emissions data are large. This leads to big differences in emission allocations: for 18 of the 32 countries considered, reduction targets in 2020 relative to the 2005 levels differ by more than 5 percentage points.

This work is the first to develop a transparent method to compute the emissions intensity for the US electricity section from 2001 through 2017 at different temporal (annual, quarterly, monthly) and regional (US, NERC, and state) levels. We find that between 2001 and 2017 the average annual CO2 emissions intensity of electricity production in the United States decreased by 30%, from 630 g CO2 kWh\u22121 to 439 g CO2 kWh\u22121. This change in CO2 intensity is attributable to an increase in generation from natural gas and wind accompanied by a reduction in coal-fired power generation. The decline in carbon intensity varies across regions, with the largest reduction between 2001 and 2017 from power plants in the Northeast (58%) and the smallest reduction from power plants in the Texas region (27%). In absolute terms the South-central region saw the largest decrease in emissions intensity (358 g CO2 kWh\u22121) and Texas saw the smallest (164 g CO2 kWh\u22121).

Drawing on expert elicitation, an expert workshop, and a review of literature, which provides a comprehensive analysis on this topic, we propose concrete interventions to induce positive social tipping dynamics and a rapid global transformation to carbon-neutral societies. These social tipping interventions comprise removing fossil-fuel subsidies and incentivizing decentralized energy generation, building carbon-neutral cities, divesting from assets linked to fossil fuels, revealing the moral implications of fossil fuels, strengthening climate education and engagement, and disclosing greenhouse gas emissions information. Safely achieving the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement requires a worldwide transformation to carbon-neutral societies within the next 30 y. Accelerated technological progress and policy implementations are required to deliver emissions reductions at rates sufficiently fast to avoid crossing dangerous tipping points in the Earth\u2019s climate system. Here, we discuss and evaluate the potential of social tipping interventions (STIs) that can activate contagious processes of rapidly spreading technologies, behaviors, social norms, and structural reorganization within their functional domains that we refer to as social tipping elements (STEs). STEs are subdomains of the planetary socioeconomic system where the required disruptive change may take place and lead to a sufficiently fast reduction in anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The results are based on online expert elicitation, a subsequent expert workshop, and a literature review. The STIs that could trigger the tipping of STE subsystems include 1) removing fossil-fuel subsidies and incentivizing decentralized energy generation (STE1, energy production and storage systems), 2) building carbon-neutral cities (STE2, human settlements), 3) divesting from assets linked to fossil fuels (STE3, financial markets), 4) revealing the moral implications of fossil fuels (STE4, norms and value systems), 5) strengthening climate education and engagement (STE5, education system), and 6) disclosing information on greenhouse gas emissions (STE6, information feedbacks).

Using seasonal-average conditions and assuming thermodynamic equilibrium, we find that the conditions for PM2.5 to respond nonlinearly to sulfate reductions are common in the eastern United States in winter, occurring at half of the sites considered, and uncommon in summer, due primarily to the influence of temperature. Accounting for diurnal and intraseasonal variability, we find that seasonal-average conditions provide a reasonable indicator of the time-averaged PM2.5 response.

Anthropogenic emissions of air pollutants in China influence not only local and regional environments but also the global atmospheric environment; therefore, it is important to understand how China's air pollutant emissions will change and how they will affect regional air quality in the future. Emission scenarios in 2020 were projected using forecasts of energy consumption and emission control strategies based on emissions in 2005, and on recent development plans for key industries in China. We developed four emission scenarios: REF[0] (current control legislations and implementation status), PC[0] (improvement of energy efficiencies and current environmental legislation), PC[1] (improvement of energy efficiencies and better implementation of environmental legislation), and PC[2] (improvement of energy efficiencies and strict environmental legislation). Under the REF[0] scenario, the emission of SO 2 , NO x , VOC and NH 3 will increase by 17%, 50%, 49% and 18% in 2020, while PM 10 emissions will be reduced by 10% over East China, compared to that in 2005. In PC[2], sustainable energy polices will reduce SO 2 , NO x and PM 10 emissions by 4.1 Tg, 2.6 Tg and 1.8 Tg, respectively; better implementation of current control policies will reduce SO 2 , NO x and PM 10 emission by 2.9 Tg, 1.8 Tg, and 1.4 Tg, respectively; strict emission standards will reduce SO 2 , NO x and PM 10 emissions by 3.2 Tg, 3.9 Tg, and 1.7 Tg, respectively. Under the PC[2] scenario, SO 2 and PM 10 emissions will decrease by 18% and 38%, while NO x and VOC emissions will increase by 3% and 8%, compared to that in 2005. Future air quality in China was simulated using the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ). Under REF[0] emissions, compared to 2005, the surface concentrations of SO 2 , NO 2 , hourly maximum ozone in summer, PM 2.5 , total sulfur and nitrogen depositions will increase by 28%, 41%, 8%, 8%, 19% and 25%, respectively, over east China.

Replacing conventional plastics with bio-based plastics (made from renewable feedstocks) is frequently proposed as a way to mitigate these impacts. Comparatively little research has considered the potential for green energy to reduce emissions in this industry. This paper compares two strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from U.S. plastics production: using renewable energy or switching to renewable feedstocks. Renewable energy pathways assume all process energy comes from wind power and renewable natural gas derived from landfill gas. Renewable feedstock pathways assume that all commodity thermoplastics will be replaced with polylactic acid (PLA) and bioethylene-based plastics, made using either corn or switchgrass, and powered using either conventional or renewable energy. Corn-based biopolymers produced with conventional energy are the dominant near-term biopolymer option, and can reduce industry-wide GHG emissions by 25%, or 16 million tonnes CO2e/year (mean value). In contrast, switching to renewable energy cuts GHG emissions by 50%\u201375% (a mean industry-wide reduction of 38 million tonnes CO2e/year). Both strategies increase industry costs\u2014by up to $85/tonne plastic (mean result) for renewable energy, and up to $3000 tonne\u22121 plastic for renewable feedstocks. Overall, switching to renewable energy achieves greater emission reductions, with less uncertainty and lower costs than switching to corn-based biopolymers.

Along with these changes, concurrent non-linear changes in photochemical levels and criteria pollutants have been observed, providing a unique opportunity to understand the effects of perturbations of mobile emission levels on the photochemistry in the region using observational and modeling approaches. The observed historical trends of ozone (O 3 ), carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxides (NO x ) suggest that ozone production in the MCMA has changed from a low to a high VOC-sensitive regime over a period of 20 years. Comparison of the historical emission trends of CO, NO x and hydrocarbons derived from mobile-source emission studies in the MCMA from 1991 to 2006 with the trends of the concentrations of CO, NO x , and the CO/NO x ratio during peak traffic hours also indicates that fuel-based fleet average emission factors have significantly decreased for CO and VOCs during this period whereas NO x emission factors do not show any strong trend, effectively reducing the ambient VOC/NO x ratio. This study presents the results of model analyses on the sensitivity of the observed ozone levels to the estimated historical changes in its precursors. The model sensitivity analyses used a well-validated base case simulation of a high pollution episode in the MCMA with the mathematical Decoupled Direct Method (DDM) and the standard Brute Force Method (BFM) in the 3-D CAMx chemical transport model. The model reproduces adequately the observed historical trends and current photochemical levels. Comparison of the BFM and the DDM sensitivity techniques indicates that the model yields ozone values that increase linearly with NO x emission reductions and decrease linearly with VOC emission reductions only up to 30% from the base case. We further performed emissions perturbations from the gasoline fleet, diesel fleet, all mobile (gasoline plus diesel) and all emission sources (anthropogenic plus biogenic).

Due to expected future increase in activities driving nitrous oxide emissions, the limited technical abatement potential available means that even at full implementation of reduction measures by 2030, global emissions can be at most stabilized at the pre-2010 level.

As far as updated emission sources are concerned, emphasis is put on those which presently constitute issues : emissions from fluidized bed combustors, emissions caused by non catalytic selective NO reduction by ammonia and urea injection, N2O emissions caused by the use of automotive three-way catalysts as well as emissions from nitric acid and adipic acid manufacturing and from municipal wastes and sewage sludges incineration. Comments on the 1991 OEDC/IPCC Report mainly emphasize : (1) the surprising absence of emission factors from stationary combustion facilities and the inadequacy of some of the scarcely presented data, (2) the strange ignorance of the important effect of aging of three-way catalysts on the emission of N2O from gasoline vehicles. These omissions are the more surprising since reliable information in these two fields were already available at the period the OEDC Report was issued and or revised. For the assessment of adequate N2O control technologies, there is an urgent need for further R&D work.

Accelerated carbonation has been shown to have a potential for improving the chemical stability and leaching behaviour of both bottom ash and fly ash/APC residues.

The analysis using AIM/Enduse[Global] shows the emission reduction target is technologically feasible, but the cost for achieving the target becomes very high if nuclear and CCS options are limited. The main reason for the cost rise is that additional investment for expensive technologies is required in order to compensate for emission increases in the steel, cement and power generation sectors in the absence of CCS. On the other hand, if material efficiency improvement measures, such as material substitution, efficient use of materials and recycling, are taken, the cost of achieving the emission reduction target is significantly reduced.

Using distribution data we perform bioclimatic modelling and examine future distribution with the HadCM3 climate model for three emission scenarios (A1B, A2A, B2A) over three time intervals (2020, 2050, 2080). The models show a profoundly negative influence on indigenous Arabica.

Ratios of particle bound organics-to-OC mass (microg/g) from the baseline exhaust were compared with their respective ratios in diesel fuel and lubricating oil, which revealed that hopanes and steranes originate from lubricating oil, whereas PAHs can either form during the combustion process or originate from diesel fuel itself. With the introduction of emission control technologies, the particle bound organics-to-OC ratios (microg/g) decreased considerably for PAHs, while the reduction was insignificant for hopanes and steranes, implying that fuel and lubricating oil have substantially different contributions to the total OC emitted by vehicles operating with after-treatment control devices compared to the baseline vehicle since these control technologies had a much larger impact on PAH OC than hopanes and steranes OC.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "8eba3c42029331b75716f95039687a63ec0ef5c7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2043582982", "DOI": "10.1016/J.RSER.2011.02.038", "CorpusId": 110570867}, "title": "Why wind power does not deliver the expected emissions reductions", "abstract": null, "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "7179ffb226c75fe744170060d9d7dd1c2e163925", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2163981879", "DOI": "10.1111/J.1600-0668.1991.00019.X", "CorpusId": 98170871}, "title": "Long\u2010term Emission of Volatile Organic Compounds from Waterborne Paints \u2013 Methods of Comparison", "abstract": "The emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from five different waterborne paints was measured in small climatic chambers under standard conditions over a one-year period.

Improved vehicle energy efficiency and emission controls have helped offset growth in vehicle activity. New technologies are diffusing into the vehicle fleet in response to fuel efficiency and emission standards. Empirical assessment of vehicle emissions is challenging because of myriad fuels and technologies, intervehicle variability, multiple emission processes, variability in operating conditions, and varying capabilities of measurement methods. Fuel economy and emissions regulations have been effective in reducing total emissions of key pollutants. Real-world fuel use and emissions are consistent with official values in the United States but not in Europe or countries that adopt European standards. Portable emission measurements systems, which uncovered a recent emissions cheating scandal, have a key role in regulatory programs to ensure conformity between \u201creal driving emissions\u201d and emission standards. The global vehicle fleet will experience tremendous growth, especially in Asia. Although existing data and modeling tools are useful, they are often based on convenience samples, small sample sizes, large variability, and unquantified uncertainty. Vehicles emit precursors to several important secondary pollutants, including ozone and secondary organic aerosols, which requires a multipollutant emissions and air quality management strategy. Gasoline and diesel are likely to persist as key energy sources to mid-century. Adoption of electric vehicles is not a panacea with regard to greenhouse gas emissions unless coupled with policies to change the power generation mix. Depending on how they are actually implemented and used, autonomous vehicles could lead to very large reductions or increases in energy consumption. Numerous other trends are addressed with regard to technology, emissions controls, vehicle operations, emission measurements, impacts on exposure, and impacts on public health. Implications: Without specific policies to the contrary, fossil fuels are likely to continue to be the major source of on-road vehicle energy consumption. Fuel economy and emission standards are generally effective in achieving reductions per unit of vehicle activity. However, the number of vehicles and miles traveled will increase. Total energy use and emissions depend on factors such as fuels, technologies, land use, demographics, economics, road design, vehicle operation, societal values, and others that affect demand for transportation, mode choice, energy use, and emissions.

The proposed scheme is based on evaluating the power spectral density (PSD) of the PA output signal and optimizing the DPD coefficients iteratively in order to minimize the output PSD around the prespecified frequency. To highlight the feasibility of the proposed implementation, the predistortion processing is kept as simple as possible, deploying quasi-memoryless polynomial models. Efficient mitigation of unwanted emissions around the target frequency is demonstrated via simulations and actual RF measurements, in both single- and dual-carrier waveform scenarios, using memoryless and memory-based PAs. The proposed DPD solution could be potentially employed in applications such as mobile devices utilizing noncontiguous multicarrier transmission, where the intermodulation spurs may overlap with the device's own receiver band, or could be potentially violating the spurious emission limits. Another target application is cognitive radio, where the PA may produce unwanted emissions that are interfering with primary-user transmissions.

Indeed, we found that various contrasting soil samples emitted HONO at high water-holding capacity (75\u2013140%), demonstrating this to be a widespread phenomenon. Supplemental nitrate stimulated HONO emissions, whereas ethanol (70% v/v) treatment to minimize microbial activities reduced HONO emissions by 80%, suggesting that nitrate-dependent biotic processes are the sources of HONO.

Incubation of pure cultures of bacterial nitrate reducers and gene-expression analyses, as well as the analyses of mutant strains deficient in nitrite reductases, showed positive correlations of HONO emissions with the capability of microbes to reduce nitrate to nitrite.

In the Canterbury Templeton soil, the nitrification rate of ammonium from the animal urine applied at 1000\u2003kg\u2003N/ha was significantly decreased by the application of DCD (10\u2003kg/ha) and DMPP (5\u2003kg/ha).

The three specific reduction targets analysed correspond to the EU 2050 Roadmap and deep decarbonization policy (80% target), the climate-energy 2014 targets (40% target), and the status quo policy (20% target); each will result in a specific emission trajectory by 2050. The results reveal stark differences between the three countries. Czechs would be on average willing to pay around EUR 13 per household per month for the 40% GHG emission reductions by 2030 or EUR 17 for 80% reductions by 2050, and the citizens of the UK are willing to pay about EUR 45.

The WTP for adopting policies to reach the 40% and 80% targets are not statistically different in any of the examined countries.

MOE is also considered a promising route for mitigation of CO2 emissions in steelmaking, production of metals free of carbon, and generation of oxygen for extra-terrestrial exploration. Until now, MOE has been demonstrated using anode materials that are consumable (graphite for use with ferro-alloys and titanium) or unaffordable for terrestrial applications (iridium for use with iron). To enable metal production without process carbon, MOE requires an anode material that resists depletion while sustaining oxygen evolution. The challenges for iron production are threefold. First, the process temperature is in excess of 1,538 degrees Celsius (ref. 10). Second, under anodic polarization most metals inevitably corrode in such conditions. Third, iron oxide undergoes spontaneous reduction on contact with most refractory metals and even carbon. Here we show that anodes comprising chromium-based alloys exhibit limited consumption during iron extraction and oxygen evolution by MOE. The anode stability is due to the formation of an electronically conductive solid solution of chromium(iii) and aluminium oxides in the corundum structure.

We characterized the climate response to these aerosols using an Earth system model. We used remote sensing observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and simulations from the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5) to optimize satellite-derived smoke emissions for high biomass burning regions. Subsequent global simulations using the adjusted fire emissions produced AODs that were in closer agreement with surface and space-based measurements. We then used CAM5, which included radiative aerosol effects, to evaluate the climate response to the fire-aerosol forcing. We conducted two 52 yr simulations, one with four sets of monthly cycling 1997\u20132009 fire emissions and one without. Fire emissions increased global mean annual AOD by 10% (+0.02) and decreased net all-sky surface radiation by 1% (1.3 W m\u22122). Elevated AODs reduced global surface temperatures by 0.13 p 0.01 \u00b0C. Though global precipitation declined only slightly, patterns of precipitation changed, with large reductions near the Equator offset by smaller increases north and south of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). A combination of increased tropospheric heating and reduced surface temperatures increased equatorial subsidence and weakened the Hadley circulation. As a consequence, precipitation decreased over tropical forests in South America, Africa and equatorial Asia. These results are consistent with the observed correlation between global temperatures and the strength of the Hadley circulation and studies linking tropospheric heating from black carbon aerosols with tropical expansion.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "90d0f072a1ef6e01ace038486cdbbb608e676562", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2082411349", "DOI": "10.1063/1.1374998", "CorpusId": 123119089}, "title": "Voltage reduction in organic light-emitting diodes", "abstract": "For practical applications, it is important to operate organic light-emitting devices at low voltages and low power consumption.

We consider the direct, semi-direct and indirect radiative effects of aerosols. The total anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing defined as the difference in the top-of-the-atmosphere radiation between 2000 and pre-industrial times amounts to \u22122.00 W/m 2 . In the future this negative global annual mean aerosol radiative forcing will only slightly change (+0.02 W/m 2 ) under the \"current legislation\" scenario. Regionally, the effects are much larger: e.g. over Eastern Europe radiative forcing would increase by +1.50 W/m 2 because of successful aerosol reduction policies, whereas over South Asia it would decrease by \u22121.10 W/m 2 because of further growth of emissions. A \"maximum feasible reduction\" of aerosols and their precursors would lead to an increase of the global annual mean aerosol radiative forcing by +1.13 W/m 2 . Hence, in the latter case, the present day negative anthropogenic aerosol forcing could be more than halved by 2030 because of aerosol reduction policies and climate change thereafter will be to a larger extent be controlled by greenhouse gas emissions. We combined these two opposing future mitigation strategies for a number of experiments focusing on different sectors and regions. In addition, we performed sensitivity studies to estimate the importance of future changes in oxidant concentrations and the importance of the aerosol microphysical coupling within the range of expected future changes. For changes in oxidant concentrations caused by future air pollution mitigation, we do not find a significant effect for the global annual mean radiative aerosol forcing.

It presents a modelling framework to identify cost-effective strategies for simultaneous reductions in emissions of various pollutants, considering interrelations. The model includes emissions from various sources and atmospheric transport from the location of emissions to the location where the environmental effect occurs. Emissions can be reduced by several abatement options. The effects of these options, including side effects on emissions of various pollutants, are explicitly incorporated in the model.The model was used for an empirical analysis of interrelations in reducing ammonia, nitrous oxide and methane emissions from the European agricultural sector.

This was caused by measures that effectively reduce ammonia emissions but have adverse side effects on nitrous oxide, such as low ammonia application of manure and animal housing systems with low ammonia emissions. The results also indicated that several measures to reduce nitrous oxide and methane emissions, such as a lower nitrogen content in the fodder, improved fertiliser efficiency and feed additives improving animal productivity in milk and growth, simultaneously reduce ammonia emissions.Furthermore, the model was used to identify cost-effective emission reduction strategies to achieve geographically specific targets for nitrogen and sulphur deposition, contributing to acidification and eutrophication, combined with reduction targets for nitrous oxide and methane emissions from the European agricultural sector, considering the interrelations in reducing emissions from the agricultural sector.

All subjects underwent positron emission tomography with the volume of distribution (V(d)) of [(11)C]hydroxyephedrine ((11)C-HED) used to assess presynaptic norepinephrine reuptake, the maximum binding capacity (B(max)) of [(11)C]CGP-12177 ((11)C-CGP-12177) to assess postsynaptic beta-adrenergic receptor density, and [(15)O]H(2)O for quantification of myocardial blood flow. Patients with ARVC demonstrated a highly significant global reduction in postsynaptic beta-adrenergic receptor density compared with that in control subjects (B(max) of (11)C-CGP-12177: 5.9+/-1.3 vs 10.2+/-2.9 pmol/g tissue, P<0.0007), whereas the presynaptic uptake-1 tended toward reduction only (V(d) of (11)C-HED: 59.1+/-25.2 vs 71.0+/-18.8 mL/g tissue, NS). There were no differences in myocardial blood flow between the groups, and plasma norepinephrine was within normal limits in patients and control subjects.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe findings demonstrate a significant reduction of myocardial beta-adrenergic receptor density in patients with ARVC. This may result from a secondary downregulation after increased local synaptic norepinephrine levels caused by increased firing rates of the efferent neurons or as the result of impaired presynaptic catecholamine reuptake.

Much of the world\u2019s fly ash is currently disposed of as a waste product. While replacing some Portland cement with fly ash can reduce production costs and the embodied emissions of concrete, the relationship between fly ash content and embodied GHG emissions in concrete has not been quantified. The impact of fly ash content on embodied water is also unknown. Furthermore, it is not known whether a global trade in fly ash for use in concrete is feasible from a carbon balance perspective, or if transport over long distances would eliminate any CO2 savings. This paper aims to quantify GHG emissions and water embodied in concrete (f\u2032c\u2009=\u200932\u00a0MPa) as a function of fly ash content and to determine the critical fly ash transportation distance, beyond which use of fly ash in concrete increases embodied GHG emissions.Materials and methodsThis paper used previously published and reported data for GHG emissions and water usage in cement production, quarries, transportation and concrete batching to quantify the embodied GHG emissions (CO2-equivalent) and water in concrete and the critical transportation distance for fly ash.ResultsFly ash content alone is not a good indicator of embodied emissions in concrete; increasing fly ash content only reduces embodied emissions when there is a corresponding reduction in the mass of Portland cement used. The total embodied GHG emissions in concrete (GHGconcrete, kg CO2-equivalent m\u22123) can be determined from the mass of Portland cement used (masscement, t m\u22123): GHGconcrete\u2009=\u200966\u2009+\u2009790.7 masscement. This equation can be used to determine the reduction in Portland cement required to meet specific GHG emissions targets for concrete, if the Portland cement is replaced by fly ash sourced within 100\u00a0km of a concrete batching plant. Fly ash content has little effect on embodied water, which was 2.7\u20134.1\u00a0m3 water per cubic metre of concrete.DiscussionFly ash can be transported more than 11,000\u00a0km by articulated truck, 47,000\u00a0km by rail and 54,000\u00a0km by sea and still result in a net reduction in GHG emissions if used to replace Portland cement in concrete. At least 70% of GHG emissions embodied in concrete were due to cement production, even for fly ash content as high as 40%. Aggregate production accounted for 17\u201325% of embodied GHG emissions. While transport of concrete from batching plant to site represented only 3\u20135% of GHG emissions, this distance is subject to wide variability and hence can be a source of variation in total embodied GHG emissions. Water used in quarrying aggregate is both the largest and the most variable quantity of water used in concrete production, and accounted for at least 89% of water consumption for all mix designs considered in this study.ConclusionsWhile this study used values applicable to Brisbane, Australia, results are presented in a generalised form for ready adaptation to other conditions, for example different distances to raw materials sources, transport emissions factors, etc.Recommendations and perspectivesA global trade in fly ash has the potential to reduce GHG emissions embodied in concrete, if the fly ash is used to reduce the consumption of Portland cement per cubic metre of concrete. Increasing fly ash usage under these conditions will reduce both the volume of fly ash disposal and the GHG emissions from the concrete industry. Efforts to reduce water consumption in the concrete industry should focus on quarrying processes, and on finding replacement materials with lower embodied water, which may include recycled aggregate. While this study has quantified the GHG emissions and water embodied in concrete as a function of fly ash content, a full life cycle study of concrete is required to determine the full impact of substituting fly ash for Portland cement. Structural characteristics, life span and operational requirements of concrete should also be considered in any decision to alter cement and fly ash content.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "df0858dd1c360ca2b613d6fa9938f6161fa61369", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2632206359", "DOI": "10.1080/14693062.2017.1333949", "CorpusId": 55134944}, "title": "Extending European energy efficiency standards to include material use: an analysis", "abstract": "ABSTRACT Existing international emissions reduction policies are not sufficient to meet the internationally agreed objective of limiting average global temperature rise to \u2018well below\u2019 two degrees, resulting in an emissions gap. Materials \u2013 such as aluminium, cement, paper, plastics and steel \u2013 act as a carrier of industrial energy that allows, through trade, the transfer of embodied emissions between sectors and countries. However, the use of materials has been overshadowed by policies focusing on energy efficiency improvements and deployment of a low carbon energy supply. This article argues that policies based on material and product demand can support domestic climate change mitigation and reduce the emissions gap, yet there is little obvious integration between climate and material efficiency policies. The article investigates current \u2018emissions flows\u2019 through the EU economy and how much of these are captured and excluded from existing EU climate policies. We analyse the potential increase in emissions coverage that would be achieved by extending EU directives that currently target the energy use of products (cars, buildings and appliances) in operation, to include the emissions required to produce the goods (i.e. embodied emissions). The analysis shows that a greater integration of material efficiency strategies within climate change mitigation policy could significantly increase the emissions coverage of existing product policies. Key policy insights Consumption is a key driver of emissions and demand reduction is an important policy option in reducing emissions, at least in the short-term, to reduce the risks of a longer-term reliance on technology breakthroughs and while the EU carbon price remains low.

In this paper, the contribution of ploughing permanent grassland and leys, including grassland renovation, to CO2 and N2O emissions and mitigation options are explored. Land use changes in the Netherlands during 1970\u20132020 are used as a case study. Three grassland management operations are defined: (i) conversion of permanent grassland to arable land and leys; (ii) rotations of leys with arable crops or bulbs; and (iii) grassland renovation. The Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) is modified to calculate C and N accumulation and release. Model calibration is based on ICBM parameters, soil organic N data and C to N ratios. IPCC emission factors are used to estimate N2O-emissions. The model is validated with data from the Rothamsted Park Grass experiments. Conversion of permanent grassland to arable land, a ley arable rotation of 3 years ley and 3 years arable crops, and a ley bulb rotation of 6 years ley and one year bulbs, result in calculated N2O and CO2 emissions totalling 250, 150 and 30 ton CO2-equivalents ha\u20131, respectively. Most of this comes from CO2. Emissions are very high directly after ploughing and decrease slowly over a period of more than 50 years. N2O emissions in 3/3 ley arable rotation and 6/1 ley bulb rotation are 2.1 and 11.0 ton CO2-equivalents ha\u20131 year\u20131, respectively. From each grassland renovation, N2O emissions amount to 1.8 to 5.5 ton CO2-equivalents ha\u20131. The calculated total annual emissions caused by ploughing in the Netherlands range from 0.5 to 0.65 Mton CO2-equivalents year\u20131. Grassland renovation in spring offers realistic opportunities to lower the N2O emissions. Developing appropriate combinations of ley, arable crops and bulbs, will reduce the need for conversion of permanent pasture. It will also decrease the rotational losses, due to a decreased proportion of leys in rotations. Also spatial policies are effective in reducing emissions of CO2 and N2O. Grassland ploughing contributes significantly to N2O and CO2 emissions. The conclusion can be drawn that total N2O emissions are underestimated, because emissions from grassland ploughing are not taken into account. Specific emission factors and the development of mitigation options are required to account for the emissions and to realise a reduction of emissions due to the changes in grassland ploughing.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "7b8ec06d3e1c5c3f0910ed65b2097698e940886e", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2168583995", "DOI": "10.1017/S1355770X10000549", "CorpusId": 10312071}, "title": "Linking reduced deforestation and a global carbon market: implications for clean energy technology and policy flexibility", "abstract": "ABSTRACT This study uses a global climate-energy-economy model to investigate potential implications of linking credits from reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries to a global carbon market, focusing on reducing emissions from deforestation (RED) and effects on energy technology innovation. Integrating RED into a global carbon market lowers the estimated total costs of a policy to achieve 535 ppmv of CO2-equivalent concentrations in 2100 by up to 25 per cent. Alternatively, a global RED program could enable additional reductions of about 20 ppmv by 2100 with no added costs compared with an energy-sector-only policy. The results indicate that market linkage of RED induces modest reductions in clean energy innovation overall but slightly enhances development of particular technologies, including carbon capture and storage. We also find that RED in combination with credit banking encourages greater mitigation in the near term, enhancing flexibility to potentially tighten emission targets at lower cost in response to future information.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "ce9865c980aa017aa7667957527a30b602eb3df5", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 12624395}, "title": "Mitigation of methane and nitrous oxide emissions from animal operations : III . A review of animal management mitigation options 1", "abstract": "The goal of this review was to analyze published data on animal management practices that mitigate enteric methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from animal operations. Increasing animal productivity can be a very effective strategy for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of livestock product. Improving the genetic potential of animals through planned cross-breeding or selection within breeds and achieving this genetic potential through proper nutrition and improvements in reproductive efficiency, animal health, and reproductive lifespan are effective approaches for improving animal productivity and reducing GHG emission intensity. In subsistence production systems, reduction of herd size would increase feed availability and productivity of individual animals and the total herd, thus lowering CH4 emission intensity. In these systems, improving the nutritive value of low-quality feeds for ruminant diets can have a considerable benefit on herd productivity while keeping the herd CH4 output constant or even decreasing it. Residual feed intake may be a tool for screening animals that are low CH4 emitters, but there is currently insufficient evidence that low residual feed intake animals have a lower CH4 yield per unit of feed intake or animal product. Reducing age at slaughter of finished cattle and the number of days that animals are on feed in the feedlot can significantly reduce GHG emissions in beef and other meat animal production systems. Improved animal health and reduced mortality and morbidity are expected to increase herd productivity and reduce GHG emission intensity in all livestock production systems. Pursuing a suite of intensive and extensive reproductive management technologies provides a significant opportunity to reduce GHG emissions. Recommended approaches will differ by region and species but should target increasing conception rates in dairy, beef, and buffalo, increasing fecundity in swine and small ruminants, and reducing embryo wastage in all species.

Conserving and managing natural and agricultural lands to retain and absorb greenhouse gasses (GHGs) are tools that have not been widely integrated into climate policy. Our analysis provides a quantification of potential climate benefits from multiple land-based activities for a jurisdiction with an emissions reduction target (up to 13.3% of the cumulative reductions needed to meet the 2050 target, or nearly three-fourths of a billion metric tons of GHGs). This approach provides a model that other jurisdictions can use to evaluate emissions reductions that might be achieved from conserving and restoring natural lands. Modeling efforts focused on future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from energy and other sectors in California have shown varying capacities to meet the emissions reduction targets established by the state. These efforts have not included potential reductions from changes in ecosystem management, restoration, and conservation. We examine the scale of contributions from selected activities in natural and agricultural lands and assess the degree to which these actions could help the state achieve its 2030 and 2050 climate mitigation goals under alternative implementation scenarios. By 2030, an Ambitious implementation scenario could contribute as much as 147 MMTCO2e or 17.4% of the cumulative reductions needed to meet the state\u2019s 2030 goal, greater than the individual projected contributions of four other economic sectors, including those from the industrial and agricultural sectors.

These problems include emissions covered by the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) and 1991 Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), as well as carbon dioxide and related {open_quotes}greenhouse gas{close_quotes} emissions. Urban travel also creates a major demand for imported oil. Therefore, for economic as well as environmental reasons, transportation planning agencies at both the state and metropolitan area level are focussing a good deal of attention on urban travel reduction policies. Much discussed policy instruments include those that encourage fewer trip starts, shorter trip distances, shifts to higher-occupancy vehicles or to nonvehicular modes, and shifts in the timing of trips from the more to the less congested periods of the day or week. Some analysts have concluded that in order to bring about sustainable reductions in urban traffic volumes, significant changes will be necessary in the way our households and businesses engage in daily travel. Such changes are likely to involve changes in the ways we organize and use traffic-generating and-attracting land within our urban areas. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the ability of current analytic methods and models to support both the evaluation and possibly the design of such vehicle travel reduction strategies, including those strategies involving the reorganization and use of urban land. The review is organized into three sections. Section 1 describes the nature of the problem we are trying to model, Section 2 reviews the state of the art in operational urban land use-transportation simulation models, and Section 3 provides a critical assessment of such models as useful urban transportation planning tools. A number of areas are identified where further model development or testing is required.", "year": 1995}, {"paperId": "5bde10e289eb8ca091807cdf5424b27211a7fd46", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2094327804", "DOI": "10.1007/S10640-006-9036-9", "CorpusId": 154303377}, "title": "An Empirical Examination of the Pollution Haven Hypothesis for India: Towards a Green Leontief Paradox?", "abstract": "Using input\u2013output analysis, we examine whether India can be regarded as a pollution haven.

This is compared with the reduction of Indian pollution caused by an import increase of equal size. In contrast to what the pollution haven hypothesis states for developing countries, we find that India considerably gains from extra trade. Comparing 1996/1997 with 1991/1992, the gains have only increased, indicating that India has moved\u2423further away from being a pollution haven.

The simplest is based on orbit-limited probe theory. This basic model can be improved by adding several effects: charge reduction at high dust densities, electron emission, ion trapping and fluctuations. The charge is reduced at high dust densities, when a significant fraction of the charge in the plasma resides on the particles, depleting the plasma. Electron emission due to electron impact or ultraviolet exposure can cause a particle to have a positive charge, which has useful implications for plasma processing, since particles are confined in a discharge only if they have a negative charge. Ion trapping occurs due to ion-neutral collisions within the attractive Debye sphere of a negatively charged particle. Trapped ions reduce the net electric force on a particle. A particle's charge fluctuates because the currents collected from the plasma consist of discrete charges arriving at the particle at random intervals. The root mean square fractional fluctuation level varies as 0.5(N)- 12 / where (N)=(Q)/e is the mean number of electron charges on the particle.", "year": 1994}, {"paperId": "5174a2b2f37bb82ff2125bbaaabcddf4a22777dc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1992265945", "DOI": "10.1243/PIME_PROC_1993_207_156_02", "CorpusId": 95243121}, "title": "NOx Emission Control in Oxygen-Rich Exhaust Through Selective Catalytic Reduction by Hydrocarbon", "abstract": "Selective catalytic reduction of nitrogen monoxide by hydrocarbon in the presence of oxygen and sulphur dioxide has very recently been found on copper ion-exchanged ZSM-5 zeolite (Cu-ZSM-5). The reaction proceeds even in the oxidizing atmosphere at temperatures as low as 573 K. Addition of oxygen to the reactant stream is necessary to achieve the selective reduction of nitrogen monoxide. The increment of concentration of hydrocarbon increased the conversion into nitrogen and expanded the active temperature region. After summarizing the new findings on Cu-ZSM-5, the present review introduces catalytic activities of various metal-ion exchanged zeolites and metal-loaded aluminas. Based on the temperature dependence of each catalyst and the change of conversion of nitrogen monoxide into nitrogen with space velocity, Cu-ZSM-5 is suggested as one of the strong candidates for catalysts applicable to lean-burn gasoline and diesel engines, though several problems such as durability to water and overheating remain to be solved.", "year": 1993}, {"paperId": "902366f1044f406a9e9ea3b6df1f3e71bcbb1e7c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1729129009", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.880384", "CorpusId": 26937407}, "title": "Should Developing Countries Participate in the Clean Development Mechanism Under the Kyoto Protocol? The Low-Hanging Fruits and Baseline Issues", "abstract": "Under the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries committed to emission reductions may fullfil part of their obligations by implementing emission reduction projects in developing countries. In doing so, they make use of the so-called Clean Development Mechansim (CDM). Two important issues surround the implementation of the CDM. First, if the cheapest abatment measures are implemented for CDM projects, developing countries may be left with only more expensive measures when they have to meet their own commitments in the future (the so-called low-hanging fruits issue). Second, a choice must be made on the type of baseline against which emission reductions are measured : an absolute baseline or a relative (to output) one (the baseline issue). The purpose of this paper is to study the interactions between these two issues from the point of view of the developing country. Two major results are obtained. First, when possible future commitments for developing countries and irreversibility of abatement measures are taken into account, we show that the industry where CDM projects are implemented enjoys large profits under an absolute baseline than under a relative one. Second, concerning the low-hanging fruits problem, the financial compensation required by the developing country for implementing \u2018too many\u2019 CDM projects is larger under the relative baseline.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "dba84a62a395b506e31f3d6dc2e67c73471cd92f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1986599402", "DOI": "10.1007/S11300-010-0168-9", "CorpusId": 153521597}, "title": "Impact of CO2 Emissions Reductions on Firms\u2019 Finance in an Emerging Economy: The Case of the Czech Republic", "abstract": "This paper investigates the relationship between economic and environmental performance with focus on firms in an emerging economy, the Czech Republic, and their CO2 emission reductions. We discuss whether the hypotheses tested for local pollutants that firms emit and firms\u2019 finances are relevant for CO2 emissions. We test the hypotheses on a sample of Czech firms included in the first phase of European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). We observe that introduction of EU ETS did not encourage significant investments in CO2 emissions reduction. Importantly, the results show that the firms that did invest in CO2 reductions experienced a negative impact on their finance. We argue that this is explained by the drop in the price of allowances on the carbon market in 2006 which resulted in firms receiving less revenue from saved allowances than they had expected.", "year": 2010}]}
