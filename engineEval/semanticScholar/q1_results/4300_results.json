In experimental stroke, early reperfusion has been reported to both prevent infarct growth and aggravate edema formation and hemorrhage, depending on the severity and duration of prior ischemia and the efficiency of reperfusion, whereas neuronal damage with or without enlarged infarction also may result from reperfusion (so-called \u201creperfusion injury\u201d). In humans, focal hyperperfusion in the subacute stage (i.e., more than 48 hours after onset) has been associated with tissue necrosis in most instances, but regarding the acute stage, its occurrence, its relations with tissue metabolism and viability, and its clinical prognostic value were poorly understood before the advent of positron emission tomography (PET), in part because of methodologic issues. By measuring both CBF and metabolism, PET is an ideal imaging modality to study the pathophysiologic mechanism of EPIH. Although only a few PET studies have been performed in the acute stage that have systematically assessed tissue and clinical outcome in relation to EPIH, they have provided important insights. In one study, about one third of the patients with first-ever middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory stroke studied within 5 to 18 hours after symptom onset exhibited EPIH. In most cases, EPIH affected large parts of the cortical MCA territory in a patchy fashion, together with abnormal vasodilation (increased cerebral blood volume), \u201cluxury perfusion\u201d (decreased oxygen extraction fraction), and mildly increased CMRO2, which was interpreted as postischemic rebound of cellular metabolism in structurally preserved tissue. In that study, the spontaneous outcome of the tissue exhibiting EPIH was good, with late structural imaging not showing infarction. This observation was supported by another PET study, which showed, in a few patients, that previously hypoperfused tissue that later exhibited hyperperfusion after thrombolysis did not undergo frank infarction at follow-up. In both studies, clinical outcome was excellent in all patients showing EPIH except one, but in this case the hyperperfused area coexisted with an extensive area of severe hypoperfusion and hypometabolism. These findings from human studies therefore suggest that EPIH is not detrimental for the tissue, which contradicts the experimental concept of \u201creperfusion injury\u201d but is consistent with the apparent clinical benefit from thrombolysis. However, PET studies performed in the cat have shown that although hyperperfusion was associated with prolonged survival and lack of histologic infarction when following brief (30-minute) MCA occlusion, it often was associated with poor outcome and extensive infarction when associated with longer (60-minute) MCA occlusion. It is unclear whether this discrepancy with human studies reflects a shorter window for tissue survival after stroke in cats, points to the cat being more prone to reperfusion injury, or indicates that EPIH tends not to develop in humans after severe or prolonged ischemia because of a greater tendency for the no-reflow phenomenon, for example. Nevertheless, the fact that the degree of hyperperfusion in these cat studies was related to the severity of prior flow reduction suggests that hyperperfusion is not detrimental per se. Preliminary observations in temporary MCA occlusion in baboons suggest that hyperperfusion developing even after 6 hours of occlusion is mainly cortical and associated with no frank infarction, as in humans. Overall, therefore, PET studies in both humans and the experimental animal, including the baboon, suggest that hyperperfusion is not a key factor in the development of tissue infarction and that it may be a harmless phenomenon when it occurs in the acute setting. However, an important issue that needs to be resolved by future studies with respect to EPIH relates to the possible occurrence of selective neuronal loss, as opposed to pan-necrosis, in the previously hyperperfused tissue.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "5e9590d029f5dff38bc008a4d1c30f33043b0b53", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1529682642", "DOI": "10.1007/978-94-017-0245-4", "CorpusId": 93498612}, "title": "Carbon dioxide recovery and utilization", "abstract": "Dedication.

It is important to quantify these emissions because their share influences the magnitude of reductions that will have to be undertaken in the anthropogenic emission sectors in order to reduce secondary air pollution problem such as photochemical smog and acid deposition. \n \nThis paper describes a model to calculate geographically-resolved VOC emissions from forests in Europe for different seasons, months or average days. We review briefly the method on how to calculate biogenic emissions from trees and available emission factor functions, including a discussion of the dependence of emissions on latitude, altitude, time of the day and temperature. Subsequently, the geographically-resolved forest and temperature data bases for Europe, as used in this model to derive the emission estimates, are described. The forest data are verified against other published forest inventories for Europe or parts of Europe. The resulting total VOC emissions are compared with existing country- or region-specific estimates, and some sensitivity analyses are carried out in order to show where the emission model could be simplified or where it needs to be improved. \n \nBased on our total forest coverage of approximately 2.2 million km^2, we calculate an average total annual emission rate of VOC's from these forests of 7.5 Megatonnes, based on typical European temperatures averaged over 30 years. This is equivalent to an areal average of 3.4 tonnes per year per km^2 forest or 0.9 tonnes per year per km^2 land area in the modeling domain.

However, the Haber\u2013Bosch process is conducted under high reaction temperature (400\u2013500 \u00b0C) and pressure (100\u2013200 atm), requiring the massive consumption of fossil fuel.[4] Moreover, a large amount of H2 used in the Haber\u2013Bosch process is obtained from the steam-reformed natural gas (CH4 + 2H2 \u2192 4H2 + CO2), releasing nearly 1.5% of CO2 gas into the atmosphere every year.[7\u20139] This CO2 emission could aggravate the current greenhouse effect, and would eventually become an environmental issue. For this reason, it is of significance to search for a green and cost-effective method for the production of ammonia. Naturally, the ammonia production can be achieved through the nitrogenases via multiple proton and electron migration paths under ambient conditions with the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as an energy transporter. Inspired by this natural reaction, electrocatalytic and photocatalytic production of ammonia under ambient conditions have been proposed recently. This newly developed scheme consumes the protons and electrons provided by electrocatalysts and photocatalysts so that N2 can be reduced to produce ammonia molecules. Since the pioneering reports on photocatalytic and electrocatalytic N2 reduction,[10,11] various materials have been proposed and investigated for achieving laboratory-based development of these technologies.[12\u201317] The current energy consumption of industrial ammonia synthesis is 35\u201350 GJ ton\u22121 of ammonia (i.e., 3.5 \u00d7 104\u20135 \u00d7 104 J gNH3). To realize the industrialization of electrocatalytic or photocatalytic N2 reduction, a comparable energy consumption should be achieved. If the electrocatalytic system with a Faradaic efficiency (FE) over 50% could be achieved, the overall energy consumption of N2 electroreduction with water would be \u22481.9 \u00d7 105 J gNH3. In comparison, the overall energy consumption of N2 photoreduction with water would be reduced to \u22482.1 \u00d7 105 J gNH3 when the photocatalytic system could reach a solar-to-chemical conversion (SCC) efficiency of 10%.[7,18\u201320] However, the reported ammonia production efficiency for both the systems remains unsatisfactory and far from industrial applications.[21\u201324] Therefore, it is of great importance to improve the efficiency of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic N2 reduction by implementing various catalyst design strategies. Ammonia is one of the most important chemicals due to its enormous applications in fertilizer production and as an energy carrier. The production of ammonia mainly relies on the traditional Haber\u2013Bosch process under high temperature and pressure, leading to massive energy consumption and notable environmental issues. Recently, electrocatalytic and photocatalytic nitrogen (N2) fixation have emerged for achieving green production of ammonia owing to their features of environmental friendliness and cost-effectiveness. However, ammonia production through electrocatalysis and photocatalysis is still far away from practical applications. To facilitate the practical applications, a thorough understanding of nitrogen fixation is highly desired for the future design of high-efficiency catalysts. Here, the fundamental investigations on electrocatalytic and photocatalytic N2 reduction are summarized. Based on the fundamental understanding, the current approaches and design strategies for heterogeneous catalysts toward electrocatalytic and photocatalytic N2 reduction are then presented. Finally, the remaining challenges and future opportunities in this field are outlined, leveraging the existing understanding on structure\u2013property relationships. It is anticipated that this review sheds some light on the development of advanced catalytic systems for ammonia production through N2 fixation.

As a responsible developing country, China pledged to reduce its carbon emission intensity by 40%- 45% below 2005levels by 2020. The realization of this target depends on not only the substantive transition of society, economy and industrial structure in national scale, but also the specific action and share of energy saving and emissions reduction in provincial scale. Based on the method provided by the IPCC, this paper examines the spatio-temporal dynamic patterns and domain factors of China's carbon emission intensity from energy consumption in 1997- 2010 using spatial autocorrelation analysis and spatial panel econometric model. The aim is to provide scientific basis for making different policies on energy conservation and carbon emission reduction in China. The results are shown as follows. Firstly, China's carbon emissions increased from 4.16 Gt to 11.29 Gt in 1997-2010, with an annual rate of 7.15%, which was much slower than that of annual growth rate of GDP(11.72%); therefore, China's carbon emission intensity tended to decline. Secondly, the changing curve of Moran's I indicated that China's carbon emission intensity from energy consumption has a continued strengthening tendency of spatial agglomeration at provincial scale. The provinces with higher and lower values appeared to be path-dependent or space-locked to some extent. Third, according to the analysis of spatial panel econometric model, it can be found that energy intensity, energy structure, industrial structure and urbanization rate were the domain factors that have impact on the spatio- temporal patterns of China's carbon emission intensity from energy consumption. Therefore, in order to realize the targets of energy conservation and emission reduction, we should improve the utilizing efficiency of energy, and optimize energy and industrial structure, and choose the low- carbon urbanization way and implement regional cooperation strategy of energy conservation and emissions reduction.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "ff86393e65828134943b10d7267e08b088a6ee8a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1998627083", "DOI": "10.3168/JDS.S0022-0302(01)74620-6", "CorpusId": 1871277, "PubMed": "11518305"}, "title": "Effect of adding alum or zeolite to dairy slurry on ammonia volatilization and chemical composition.", "abstract": "Development of cost-effective amendments for treating dairy slurry has become a critical problem as the number of cows on farms continues to grow and the acreage available for manure spreading continues to shrink.

Ammonia volatilization over 96 h was measured with six small wind tunnels with gas scrubbing bottles at the inlets and outlets. Manure samples from the start and end of trials were analyzed for total nitrogen and phosphorus, and were extracted with 0.01 M CaCl2, 1.0 M KCl, and water with the extracts analyzed for ammonium nitrogen, phosphorous, aluminum, and pH. The addition of 6.25% zeolite or 2.5% alum to dairy slurry reduced ammonia emissions by nearly 50 and 60%, respectively. Alum treatment retained ammonia by reducing the slurry pH to 5 or less. In contrast, zeolite, being a cation exchange medium, adsorbed ammonium and reduced dissolved ammonia gas. In addition, alum essentially eliminated soluble phosphorous. Zeolite also reduced soluble phosphorous by over half, but the mechanism for this reduction is unclear. Alum must be carefully added to slurry to avoid effervescence and excess additions, which can increase soluble aluminum in the slurry.

Coupled with this limited duration, increases in population and per\u2010capita energy demand mean that soil carbon sequestration could play only a minor role in closing the difference between predicted and target carbon emissions by 2100. However, if atmospheric CO2 concentrations are to be stabilized at reasonable levels (450\u2013650 ppm), drastic reductions in carbon emissions will be required over the next 20\u201330 years.

We examine the break-even value for CCS adoptions, that is, the critical value in the charge for CO2 emissions that would justify investment in CCS capabilities. Our analysis takes explicitly into account that the supply of electricity at the wholesale level (generation) is organized competitively in some U.S. jurisdictions, whereas in others a regulated utility provides integrated generation and distribution services. For either market structure, we find that emissions charges near $30 per tonne of CO2 would be the break-even value for adopting CCS capabilities at new coal-fired power plants. The corresponding break-even values for natural gas plants are substantially higher, near $60 per tonne. Our break-even estimates serve as a basis for projecting the change in electricity prices once carbon emissions become costly. CCS capabilities effectively put an upper bound on the increase in electricity prices resulting from carbon regulations, and we estimate this bound to be near 30% at the retail level for both coal and natural gas plants. In contrast to the competitive power supply scenario, however, these price increases materialize only gradually for a regulated utility.

Analyses that favor clean vehicle strategies tend to overlook or undervalue some significant impacts, including cleaner vehicle lifecycle analysis and rebound effects, and mobility management co-benefits. More comprehensive analysis tends to favor mobility management.

The proposed approach could be used by vertically integrated utilities as well as the ISOs in electricity markets. In this model, random disturbances, such as outages of generation units and transmission lines as well as load forecasting inaccuracies, are modeled as scenario trees using the Monte Carlo simulation method. For dual optimization, coupling constraints among scenarios are relaxed and the optimization problem is decomposed into deterministic long-term SCUC subproblems. For each deterministic long-term SCUC, resource constraints represent fuel and emission constraints (in the case of vertically integrated utilities) and energy constraints (in the case of electricity markets). Lagrangian relaxation is used to decompose subproblems with long-term SCUC into tractable short-term MIP-based SCUC subproblems without resource constraints. Accordingly, penalty prices (Lagrangian multipliers) are signals to coordinate the master problem and small-scale subproblems. Computational requirements for solving scenario-based optimization models depend on the number of scenarios in which the objective is to minimize the weighted-average generation cost over the entire scenario tree. In large scale applications, the scenario reduction method is introduced for enhancing a tradeoff between calculation speed and accuracy of long-term SCUC solution.

To explore these feedback processes quantitatively, multicomponent gas diffusion and advection are implemented into an existing reactive transport model that includes a full suite of geochemical reactions. Multicomponent gas diffusion is described on the basis of the dusty gas model, which accounts for all relevant gas diffusion mechanisms. The simulation of gas attenuation in partially saturated landfill soil covers, methane production, and oxidation in aquifers contaminated by organic compounds (e.g., an oil spill site) and pyrite oxidation in mine tailings demonstrate that both diffusive and advective gas transport can be affected by geochemical reactions. Methane oxidation in landfill covers reduces the existing upward pressure gradient, thereby decreasing the contribution of advective methane emissions to the atmosphere and enhancing the net flux of atmospheric oxygen into the soil column. At an oil spill site, methane oxidation causes a reversal in the direction of gas advection, which results in advective transport toward the zone of oxidation both from the ground surface and the deeper zone of methane production. Both diffusion and advection contribute to supply atmospheric oxygen into the subsurface, and methane emissions to the atmosphere are averted. During pyrite oxidation in mine tailings, pressure reduction in the reaction zone drives advective gas flow into the sediment column, enhancing the oxidation process.

To improve the CDM with respect to the diffusion of RETs, it is crucial to understand the factors that ultimately drive or hinder investments in these technologies.

While sewage and landfill are strongly affected independently of their location; wind, hydro and biomass projects experience small to medium impacts through the carbon price, and strongly depend on regional conditions. PV depends more on regional conditions than on the carbon price but is always unprofitable.

Relying on the classification of the World Bank, the countries were categorised to developed and developing countries. We also used a dynamic common correlated effects estimator.

An increase of biomass energy intensity (biomass consumption in tonnes divided by real gross domestic product) of 100% will increase CO2 emissions (metric tons per capita) within the range of 4 to 47%.

When the full HadCM3LC SST anomalies (SSTAs) are used, the atmosphere model reproduces the Amazon Basin climate change exhibited by HadCM3LC, including much of the reduction in Amazon Basin rainfall. This rainfall change is shown to be the combined effect of SSTAs in both the tropical Atlantic and the Pacific, with roughly equal contributions from each basin. The greatest rainfall reduction occurs from May to October, outside of the mature South American monsoon (SAM) season. This dry season response is the combined effect of a more rapid warming of the tropical North Atlantic relative to the south, and warm SSTAs in the tropical east Pacific. Conversely, a weak enhancement of mature SAM season rainfall in response to Atlantic SST change is suppressed by the atmospheric response to Pacific SST. This net wet season response is sufficient to prevent dry season soil moisture deficits from being recharged through the SAM season, leading to a perennial soil moisture reduction and an associated 30% reduction in annual Amazon Basin net primary productivity (NPP).

The model generally performs well compared to measurements in simulating the surface temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed and direction, near-surface O3 and PM2.5 mass concentrations, and aerosol constituents. High aerosol concentrations in Xi'an and surrounding areas significantly decrease the photolysis frequencies and can reduce O3 concentrations by more than 50\u202f\u00b5g\u202fm\u22123 (around 25\u202fppb) on average.

Emissions of SOX are currently being reduced significantly in many places by wet scrubbing of the exhaust or flue gases, but most of the NOX in the flue gases is NO, which is so insoluble that it is virtually impossible to scrub. Consequently, NOX control is mostly achieved by using combustion modifications to limit the formation of NOX, or by using chemical reduction techniques to reduce NOX to N2. Low NOX burners are relatively inexpensive but can only achieve about 50% reduction in NOX emissions; selective catalytic reduction (SCR) can achieve high reductions but is very expensive. The removal of NOX in wet scrubbers could be greatly enhanced by gas-phase oxidation of the NO to NO2, HNO2, and HNO3 (the acid gases are much more soluble in water than NO). This oxidation is accomplished by injecting liquid hydrogen peroxide into the flue gas; the H2O2 vaporizes and dissociates into hydroxyl radicals. The active OH radicals then oxidize the NO and NO2. This NOX control technique might prove economically feasible at power plants with existing SO2 scrubbers. The higher chemical costs for H2O2 would be balanced by the investment cost savings, compared with an alternative such as SCR. The oxidation of NOX by using hydrogen peroxide has been demonstrated in a laboratory quartz tube reactor.

In view of the lifetime evaluation of plasma exposed carbon components and of impurity production in present and future machines such as ITER, an analytical expression for the erosion yield by chemical sputtering for the relevant energies, temperatures and incident fluxes is of special importance. An extrapolation to fluxes and energies relevant for high density divertor plasmas has not been possible up to now on the basis of semiempirical fits to laboratory data. Starting from a short review of the existing empirical formulas, recent detailed investigations of the atomistic processes for the thermally activated hydrocarbon emission are described, which enable the formulation of an improved analytical description including the ion flux as a parameter. The chemical erosion of graphite by hydrogen bombardment results from two processes: the thermally activated hydrocarbon emission, Ytherm, and a surface process at low energies and low temperatures resulting from the kinetic ejection of surface hydrocarbon complexes from collisional energy transfer, Ysurf. The new analytic description can be fitted well to the existing data for ion beam erosion, and extrapolation to divertor relevant fluxes is possible. At high ion fluxes the maximum of chemical erosion is shifted to higher temperatures, where annealing of damaged structures leads to a stronger reduction of Ytherm than previously estimated. There are no data on a possible flux dependence of Ysurf, leaving still some uncertainty in extrapolation", "year": 1996}, {"paperId": "41e8358cd89189eff23ac6452c639b5eb722c5cf", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2067897035", "DOI": "10.1080/10473289.2003.10466152", "CorpusId": 25303897, "PubMed": "12661688"}, "title": "Effects of Changes in Sulfate, Ammonia, and Nitric Acid on Particulate Nitrate Concentrations in the Southeastern United States", "abstract": "Abstract A thermodynamic equilibrium model, Simulating Composition of Atmospheric Particles at Equilibrium (SCAPE2), was used to investigate the response of fine particulate NO3 \u2212 to changes in concentrations of HNO3 , NH3 , and SO4 2\u2212 in the southeastern United States. The data consisted of daily, 24-hr time resolution measurements from the Aerosol Research Inhalation Epidemiology Study (ARIES) Jefferson Street (Atlanta) site and five other sites of the Southeastern Aerosol Research and Characterization Project (SEARCH). Reductions of total NH3 (gas-phase NH3 plus particulate NH4 +), total NO3 \u2212 (HNO3 plus particulate NO3 \u2212), SO4 2\u2212, or combined total NO3 \u2212 (HNO3 plus particulate NO3 \u2212) with SO4 2\u2212 were used to estimate the effects of changing emission levels. The conversion of SO2 to SO4 2\u2212 and NO2 to HNO3 involves additional nonlinear reactions not incorporated into the model. For all sites, fine particulate NO3 \u2212 concentrations decreased in response to reductions of either NH3 or total NO3 \u2212, but the particulate NO3 \u2212 decreases were greater for the NH3 reductions than for the total NO3 \u2212 reductions. Particulate NO3 \u2212 concentrations increased in response to reductions of SO4 2\u2212. For the combined reduction (total NO3 \u2212 plus SO4 2\u2212), the resulting particulate NO3 \u2212 concentrations were on average no different than the base-case NO3 \u2212 levels.

Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are the most harmful components of animal manure, but odor from the manure itself and the livestock facilities is also a problem. Improving the nutrient efficiency of the livestock helps to decrease excretion of these environmental contaminants. Pigs and chickens are the main animals used in studies to improve nutrient efficiency to reduce excretion of environmental contaminants. Addition of feed supplements and modifying feeding programs to improve nutrient efficiency can result in significant decreases in the N, P, odor, and dry matter (DM) weight of manure. Examples of these methods include the following. (1) The addition of synthetic amino acids and reducing protein contents resulted in N reductions of 10 to 27% in broilers, 18 to 35% in chicks and layers, 19 to 62% in pigs, and a 9 to 43% reduction in odor from pigs.

Controlling these emissions requires a thorough understanding of all sources and controlling factors at the farm level. This paper examines the various controlling factors and proposes farm management measures to decrease N2O emissions from intensively managed grassland livestock farming systems. Two types of regulating mechanisms of N2O emissions can be distinguished, i.e. environmental regulators and farm management regulators. Both types of regulators may influence the number and size of N2O sources, and the timing of the emissions. At the field and farm scales, two clusters of environmental regulating factors have been identified, i.e. soil and climate, and three levels of management regulators, i.e. strategic, tactical and operational. Though the understanding of these controls is still incomplete, the available information suggests that there is large scope for diminishing N2O emissions at the farm scale, using strategies that have been identified already. For example, model calculations indicate that it may be possible to decrease total N2O emissions from intensively managed dairy farms in The Netherlands in the short term from a mean of about 19 to about 13 kg N per ha per year by more effective nutrient management, whilst maintaining productivity. There is scope for a further reduction to a level of about 6 kg N per ha per year. Advisory tools for controlling N2O emissions have to be developed for all three management levels, i.e. strategic, tactical and operational, to be able to effectively implement emission reduction options and strategies in practice.

Comparison with observation forced land surface model estimates indicates that the models do reasonably well at replicating our best estimates of twentieth century, large scale drought occurrence, although the frequency of long-term (more than 12-month duration) droughts are over-estimated. Under the future projections, the models show decreases in soil moisture globally for all scenarios with a corresponding doubling of the spatial extent of severe soil moisture deficits and frequency of short-term (4\u20136-month duration) droughts from the mid-twentieth century to the end of the twenty-first. Long-term droughts become three times more common.

In general, changes under the higher emission scenarios, A1B and A2 are the greatest, and despite following a reduced emissions pathway relative to the present day, the B1 scenario shows smaller but still substantial increases in drought, globally and for most regions. Increases in drought are driven primarily by reductions in precipitation with increased evaporation from higher temperatures modulating the changes. In some regions, increases in precipitation are offset by increased evaporation.

We discuss changes in emissions into components related to overall population and economic growth, changes related to mode shift, changes in the ratio of fuel used to passenger or tonne-km of activity, and changes in the CO2 content of fuels. We also note where data permit how changes in vehicle utilization affected CO2 emissions. We comment on factors causing the changes in components of emissions. We then present Laspeyres and Log-Mean Divisia Index decompositions of the 1960-2006 changes. From this decomposition we speculate on whether the factors associated with the increases in CO2 emissions since 1960 still could be important in the future, and what other factors could reduce emissions. Since the first oil crises of 1973 have been reductions in emissions per passenger-km or tonne-km of key modes, driven both by changes in technology and changes in the utilization and operation of vehicles. There was no significant change in the amount of CO2 per unit of fuel consumed. In the same time frame, overall transport activity rose and that of the most energy and carbon intensive modes, cars, trucks, and aircraft, rose the most quickly. Shifts to these modes offset some of the savings in fuel and carbon from improvements in each mode; indeed shifts to trucking almost offset the impacts of reduced CO2 emissions per tonne-km of each mode in freight. Indeed, an important surprise from this analysis is the continued rise in the importance of freight as a source of CO2 emissions compared to travel.

Since the mid-late 20th century, legislation to control acid rain precursors in both Europe and the US has led to significant declines in both SO4\u2013S and H+ in precipitation and streams. However, several authors noted that declines in streamwater SO4\u2013S did not result in stoichiometric reductions in stream H+, and suggested that observed reductions in base cation inputs in precipitation could lessen the effect of air pollution control on improving stream pH. We examined long-term precipitation chemistry (1978\u20132010) from nearly 30 sites in the US and Europe that are variably affected by acid deposition and that have a variety of industrial and land-use histories to (1) quantify trends in SO4\u2013S, H+, NH4\u2013N, Ca, and NO3\u2013N, (2) assess stoichiometry between H+ and SO4\u2013S before and after 1990, and (3) examine regional synchrony of trends. We expected that although the overall efforts of developed countries to reduce air pollution and acid rain by the mid-late 20th century would tend to synchronize precipitation chemistry among regions, geographically varied patterns of fossil fuel use and pollution control measures would produce important asynchronies among European countries and the United States. We also expected that control of particulate versus gaseous emission, along with trends in NH3 emissions, would be the two most significant factors affecting the stoichiometry between SO4\u2013S and H+. Relationships among H+, SO4\u2013S, NH4\u2013N, and cations differed markedly between the US and Europe. Controlling for SO4\u2013S levels, H+ in precipitation was significantly lower in Europe than in the US, because (1) alkaline dust loading from the Sahara/Sahel was greater in Europe than the US, and (2) emission of NH3, which neutralizes acidity upon conversion to NH4+, is generally significantly higher in Europe than in the US. Trends in SO4\u2013S and H+ in precipitation were close to stoichometric in the US throughout the period of record, but not in Europe, especially eastern Europe. Ca in precipitation declined significantly before, but not after 1990 in most of the US, but Ca declined in eastern Europe even after 1990. SO4\u2013S in precipitation was only weakly related to fossil fuel consumption. The stoichiometry of SO4\u2013S and H+ may be explained in part by emission controls, which varied over time and among regions. Control of particulate emissions reduces alkaline particles that neutralize acid precursors as well as S-containing particulates, reducing SO4\u2013S and Ca more steeply than H+, consistent with trends in the northeastern US and Europe before 1990. In contrast, control of gaseous SO2 emissions results in a stoichiometric relationship between SO4\u2013S and H+, consistent with trends in the US and many western European countries, especially after 1991. However, in many European countries, declining NH3 emissions contributed to the lack of stoichiometry between SO4\u2013S and H+.Recent reductions in NOx emissions have also contributed to declines in H+ in precipitation. Future changes in precipitation acidity are likely to depend on multiple factors including trends in NOx and NH3 emission controls, naturally occurring dust, and fossil fuel use, with significant implications for the health of both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "773a1ee2e66b2a0a83965854c887e1ab5cdcc5d7", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2800364607", "DOI": "10.1002/anie.201803397", "CorpusId": 205407275, "PubMed": "29656589"}, "title": "Creating a Low-Potential Redox Polymer for Efficient Electroenzymatic CO2 Reduction.", "abstract": "Increasing greenhouse gas emissions have resulted in greater motivation to find novel carbon dioxide (CO2 ) reduction technologies, where the reduction of CO2 to valuable chemical commodities is desirable.

However, very few studies have considered consumption-based carbon emissions, even though a clear understanding of the impact of consumption patterns is essential for redirecting the pattern to more sustainable consumption. Thus, this study takes a step forward by using consumption-based carbon emissions (CCO2) as a proxy of environmental degradation using the novel non-linear ARDL technique for Chilefrom 1990 to 2018. To the best understanding of the investigators, no prior studies have investigated the drivers of consumption-based carbon emissions utilizing non-linear ARDL. The study employed ADF and KSS (non-linear) tests to check the data series\u2019 stationary level. Additionally, the symmetric and asymmetric ARDL approaches are utilized to explore cointegration and long-run linkages. According to the results, there is no symmetric cointegration among the variables; however, the empirical estimates reveal a long-run asymmetric connection between the indicators and CCO2 emissions. The novel results from the asymmetric ARDL indicate that negative and positive changes in economic growth deteriorate the quality of the environment. Interestingly, a reduction in economic growth makes a more dominant contribution to environmental degradation. Moreover, positive changes in renewable energy usage improve the quality of Chile\u2019s environment, inferring that the country can achieve a reduction in environmental degradation by boosting renewable energy consumption. Surprisingly, the study found that technological innovation is ineffective in reducing consumption-based carbon emissions, which implies that Chile\u2019s technological innovation is not directed towards manufacturing green technology. Finally, the policy implications are discussed with respect to reducing consumption-based carbon emissions.", "year": 2021}, {"paperId": "f1a13e1dcc70cca869ee3ce31122ce23218d18f9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2058981369", "DOI": "10.1617/S11527-006-9089-9", "CorpusId": 136741542}, "title": "Quantifying shrinkage cracking in fiber reinforced concrete using the ring test", "abstract": "Tensile stress can develop in concrete when rest raint prevents the concrete from shrinking freely in response to drying, chemical reaction, or temperature reduction. When these tensile stresses exceed the tensile strength of the concrete, visible cracking may be expected to occur. While several test methods have been developed to assess a material's potential for early-age shrinkage cracking, this paper describes the use of the \u2018ring-test\u2019 for assessing the performance of a fiber reinforced concrete. An equation is presented that enables the residual stress that develops in the concrete ring specimen to be estimated. This expression is used to approximate the stress that is transferred across a crack. It is shown that for conventional fiber reinforced concrete (i.e., the mixtures described in this paper) the pre-peak mechanical properties (elastic modulus, splitting tensile strength and free shrinkage) are not influenced greatly by the addition of fibers. Rather, fibers appear to influence shrinkage-cracking behavior only after the crack begins to open. To better understand the role of fibers in mitigating early-age shrinkage cracking passive acoustic emission testing was used. Acoustic emission measurements indicate microcracking due to the heterogenous nature of the concrete and the presence of moisture gradients. The acoustic emission results highlight how a single crack begins to form into a visible crack. Finally, an approach is presented for estimating crack-width based on the strain data measured from the ring test. The role of the specimen geometry is discussed for comparing the ring test with field applications.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "8beccfae6e5e2bf62d3dbad5d1222776cd4d328b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2323555491", "DOI": "10.1007/S12206-015-1248-X", "CorpusId": 112852739}, "title": "Experimental analysis on neat mustard oil methyl ester subjected to ultrasonication and microwave irradiation in four stroke single cylinder Diesel engine", "abstract": "Transesterification of fatty acid using the application of ultrasound stirring and microwave irradiation has been used of late for biodiesel production from various vegetable oil and animal fats.

A typical episode with elevated ozone over eastern China from 12 to 16 August 2001 was investigated by using a tropospheric chemistry and transport model (TCTM), driven by a non-hydrostatic mesoscale model MM5. The meteorological conditions during this period were characterized by high-pressure systems associated with low wind speeds, high temperatures and clear skies. Afternoon ozone concentrations exceeding 80 parts per billion (ppb) occurred over broad areas of eastern China. There is a generally good agreement between simulation and observation, indicating that the TCTM is able to represent major physical and chemical processes of tropospheric ozone and well reproduce the diurnal and day-to-day variability associated with synoptic conditions. The sensitivity analysis reveals a significant influence of biogenic hydrocarbons on regional ozone. Ozone levels are apparently enhanced by biogenic emission over large areas of eastern China. The largest increase up to 30 ppb in daytime average concentration is found in portions of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, Yangtze Delta and northeast China. However, the response of ozone to biogenic emission varies spatially, showing more sensitivity in polluted areas than that in clean rural areas. The regimes limited by nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic carbon (VOC) in eastern China are further investigated with respect to biogenic emission. Ozone shows a clear tendency to shift from VOC limitation to NOx limitation as it moves from urban and industrial areas to rural areas. Most of the rural areas in southern China tend to be NOx limited, whereas most of the northern parts of China appear to be VOC limited. By considering biogenic emission, ozone tends to become more NOx limited and less VOC limited, both in extent and intensity, over eastern china. Furthermore, some regions have completely shifted from being VOC limited to being NOx limited.", "year": 2005}, {"paperId": "6aa9e65c912110b0cf69ef71dc9eccd85c8290b8", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1560177952", "DOI": "10.4271/2003-01-0289", "CorpusId": 93730928}, "title": "Particulate Matter and Aldehyde Emissions from Idling Heavy-Duty Diesel Trucks", "abstract": "As part of a multi-agency study concerning emissions and fuel consumption from heavy-duty diesel truck idling, Oak Ridge National Laboratory personnel measured CO, HC, NOx, CO2, O2, particulate matter (PM), aldehyde and ketone emissions from truck idle exhaust. Two methods of quantifying PM were employed: conventional filters and a Tapered Element Oscillating Microbalance (TEOM). A partial flow micro-dilution tunnel was used to dilute the sampled exhaust to make the PM and aldehyde measurements. The work was performed at the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Test Center's (ATC) climate controlled chamber. ATC performed 37 tests on five class-8 trucks (model years ranging from 1992 to 2001). One was equipped with an 11 hp diesel auxiliary power unit (APU), and another with a diesel direct-fired heater (DFH). The APU powers electrical accessories, heating, and air conditioning, whereas a DFH heats the cab in cold weather. Both devices offer an alternative to extended truck-engine idling. Exhaust emission measurements were also made for the APU and DFH. Trucks were idled at a high and low engine speed in the following environments: 32 \u00b0C (90 \u00b0F) with cabin air conditioning on, \u221218 \u00b0C (0 \u00b0F) with the cabin heater on, and 18 \u00b0C (65 \u00b0F) with no accessories on. ATC test technicians adjusted the air conditioning or heater to maintain a target cabin temperature of 21 \u00b0C (70 \u00b0F). Each test was run for approximately three hours. Comparison of the results from the APU to those from the idling trucks implies that use of an APU to replace truck idling gives fuel savings (and CO2 reduction) on the order of 60-85%, 50-97% reductions in NOx, CO and HC, and PM reductions of -20% to 95%. PM emissions from the APU were higher than the \u201cbest\u201d idling truck engine cases. The diesel-fired heater had significantly lower emissions and fuel consumption than the APU. The potential for fuel savings and environmental benefits are readily apparent. Results for PM emissions showed a wide range of emissions rates from <1 g/hr to over 20 g/hr, with the newest trucks in the 1-5 g/hr range. PM emissions generally decreased with an increase in ambient temperature and increased disproportionately with an increase in engine speed. Aldehyde mass emissions rate increased with both decreasing temperature and increasing engine speed. The mass emissions rate of regulated gaseous species generally increased with increasing engine speed.

We describe an assimilation system for atmospheric methane (CH4), CarbonTracker-CH4, and demonstrate the diagnostic value of global or zonally averaged CH4 abundances for evaluating the results. We show that CarbonTracker-CH4 is able to simulate the observed zonal average mole fractions and capture inter-annual variability in emissions quite well at high northern latitudes (53\u201390\u00b0 N). In contrast, CarbonTracker-CH4 is less successful in the tropics where there are few observations and therefore misses significant variability and is more influenced by prior flux estimates. CarbonTracker-CH4 estimates of total fluxes at high northern latitudes are about 81 \u00b1 7 Tg CH4 yr\u22121, about 12 Tg CH4 yr\u22121 (13%) lower than prior estimates, a result that is consistent with other atmospheric inversions. Emissions from European wetlands are decreased by 30%, a result consistent with previous work by Bergamaschi et al. (2005); however, unlike their results, emissions from wetlands in boreal Eurasia are increased relative to the prior estimate. Although CarbonTracker-CH4 does not estimate an increasing trend in emissions from high northern latitudes for 2000 through 2010, significant inter-annual variability in high northern latitude fluxes is recovered. Exceptionally warm growing season temperatures in the Arctic occurred in 2007, a year that was also anonymously wet. Estimated emissions from natural sources were greater than the decadal average by 4.4 \u00b1 3.8 Tg CH4 yr\u22121 in 2007. CarbonTracker-CH4 estimates for temperate latitudes are only slightly increased over prior estimates, but about 10 Tg CH4 yr\u22121 is redistributed from Asia to North America. This difference exceeds the estimated uncertainty for North America (\u00b13.5 Tg CH4 yr\u22121). We used time invariant prior flux estimates, so for the period from 2000 to 2006, when the growth rate of global atmospheric CH4 was very small, the assimilation does not produce increases in natural or anthropogenic emissions in contrast to bottom-up emission data sets. After 2006, when atmospheric CH4 began its recent increases, CarbonTracker-CH4 allocates some of the increases to anthropogenic emissions at temperate latitudes, and some to tropical wetland emissions. For temperate North America the prior flux increases by about 4 Tg CH4 yr\u22121 during winter when biogenic emissions are small. Examination of the residuals at some North American observation sites suggests that increased gas and oil exploration may play a role since sites near fossil fuel production are particularly hard for the inversion to fit and the prior flux estimates at these sites are apparently lower and lower over time than what the atmospheric measurements imply. The tropics are not currently well resolved by CarbonTracker-CH4 due to sparse observational coverage and a short assimilation window. However, there is a small uncertainty reduction and posterior emissions are about 18% higher than prior estimates. Most of this increase is allocated to tropical South America rather than being distributed among the global tropics. Our estimates for this source region are about 32 \u00b1 4 Tg CH4 yr\u22121, in good agreement with the analysis of Melack et al.

Levinson (Am Econ Rev 99(5):2177\u20132192, 2009) finds that the offshoring of polluting industries to countries with lower environmental standards played only small role in the cleanup of US manufacturing, which was largely due to improvements in production technique. But there is no evidence of whether US patterns hold in other developed economies. I provide the first analysis of the pollution intensity of EU production and imports to examine which forces drove the EU cleanup. I find that concerns about the effect of pollution offshoring were unfounded in the European Union, not because the effect was small like in the United States, but because the patterns of specialization of EU production and imports were exactly opposite to what pollution offshoring would predict. Starting in the early 2000s, EU manufacturing increasingly produced more pollution-intensive goods while imports became progressively less pollution-intensive, especially from low-income countries. There are two notable exceptions: primary aluminum and electrometallurgical products, except steel, which do provide evidence of offshoring from the EU to lower income countries. The \u201cbrown\u201d specialization of EU production is difficult to explain, but about a quarter can be matched by increased demand for EU exports of polluting goods. However, similar to the US cleanup, changes in production and imports were overwhelmed by improvements in production technique, which were the main drivers of the cleanup of manufacturing.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "9f087653d7f19a62e1462058c00dcd5c3286c633", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2945589931", "DOI": "10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.04.148", "CorpusId": 155514288}, "title": "Industrial energy use and carbon emissions reduction in the iron and steel sector: A UK perspective", "abstract": null, "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "361ab4e0a97a4218a9fd87d907664d5560b9024f", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2141549209", "DOI": "10.1002/CHEM.200390050", "CorpusId": 8109549, "PubMed": "12532297"}, "title": "Synthesis, photophysical and electrochemical properties, and biological labeling studies of cyclometalated iridium(III) bis(pyridylbenzaldehyde) complexes: novel luminescent cross-linkers for biomolecules.", "abstract": "We report the synthesis, characterization, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of a series of luminescent cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes containing two aldehyde functional groups [Ir(pba)(2)(N-N)](PF(6)) (Hpba=4-(2-pyridyl)benzaldehyde; N-N=2,2'-bipyridine, bpy (1), 1,10-phenanthroline, phen (2), 3,4,7,8-tetramethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 3,4,7,8-Me(4)-phen (3), 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, 4,7-Ph(2)-phen (4)).

The problems with project-level assessment in the AIJ phase have led to interest in simpler approaches for determining project additionality and baselines.

The percentage of the project\u2019s verified carbon credits could be scaled accordingly.

Beginning with the 1980s, substantial progress in volcano-monitoring techniques and networks \u2013 ground-based as well space-based \u2013 has been achieved. Although some geochemical monitoring techniques (e.g., remote measurement of volcanic gas emissions) are being increasingly applied and show considerable promise, seismic and geodetic methods to date remain the techniques of choice and are the most widely used. Availability of comprehensive volcano-monitoring data was a decisive factor in the successful scientific and governmental responses to the reawakening of Mount St. elens (Washington, USA) in 1980 and, more recently, to the powerful explosive eruptions at Mount Pinatubo (Luzon, Philippines) in 1991. However, even with the ever-improving state-of-the-art in volcano monitoring and predictive capability, the Mount St. Helens and Pinatubo case histories unfortunately still represent the exceptions, rather than the rule, in successfully forecasting the most likely outcome of volcano unrest.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "a77c931e5dad71ba37ecd4956457c3d73b22a97b", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2332732417", "DOI": "10.1021/es404562e", "CorpusId": 13251598, "PubMed": "24483209"}, "title": "A hybrid method for provincial scale energy-related carbon emission allocation in China.", "abstract": "Achievement of carbon emission reduction targets proposed by national governments relies on provincial/state allocations. In this study, a hybrid method for provincial energy-related carbon emissions allocation in China was developed to provide a good balance between production- and consumption-based approaches. In this method, provincial energy-related carbon emissions are decomposed into direct emissions of local activities other than thermal power generation and indirect emissions as a result of electricity consumption. Based on the carbon reduction efficiency principle, the responsibility for embodied emissions of provincial product transactions is assigned entirely to the production area. The responsibility for carbon generation during the production of thermal power is borne by the electricity consumption area, which ensures that different regions with resource endowments have rational development space. Empirical studies were conducted to examine the hybrid method and three indices, per capita GDP, resource endowment index and the proportion of energy-intensive industries, were screened to preliminarily interpret the differences among China's regional carbon emissions.

It focuses on the EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. The core rule of emissions trading is that industries need to cover their emissions with tradable emission rights. There are several options for the government to distribute those rights, basically through a free allocation or an auction. The need to cover emissions with a tradable right gives a financial incentive to firms to choose for the reduction of emissions, of course related to the market price of the tradable right. This price-incentive at the same time urges governments to put in place a sound enforcement approach. One of the characteristics of current emissions trading schemes is that they heavily rely on self-monitoring duties. Nevertheless, the ultimate responsibility to inspect rests on the government. However, with the introduction of emissions trading a remarkable shift takes place: instead of the more traditional control of the actual behaviour of industries, inspection by the government ranges under the greenhouse gas emissions-trading instrument much more towards the control of self-monitoring activities. The use of verifiers within the EU greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme is in this respect a unique new provision, but at the same time raises many practical and fundamental questions.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "4c9e768e2aae77a1bd72a5704d1b6398af9aac68", "externalIds": {"CorpusId": 53582242}, "title": "Options for the future of cement", "abstract": "Options for more sustainable cementitious materials are reviewed. The most viable option involves blending Portland cement clinker with increasing levels of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs), but the availability of common SCMs is low compared to the demand for cement. Calcined clays are the only other materials that are potentially available in large enough amounts to continue the trend of reducing clinker content in blended cements. Recently we demonstrated that partially replacing clinker by calcined clays combined with limestone (LC blends) can be used to achieve blended cements with good performance at much lower levels of clinker.

Therefore, low NH3 emission slurry application technologies have been developed, the reduction efficiency of which has typically been estimated through measurements using wind tunnels or integrated horizontal flux (IHF) micrometeorological techniques. A recovery of 100% of released NH3 can be obtained if wind tunnels are designed to avoid pulses of wind into the tunnel through the canopy opening and leaks from the tunnels. The NH3 emission measured with wind tunnels adjusted to an air flow of 1 m/s deviated significantly (P < 0.05) from the emission measured using IHF methods, which are generally considered to give reliable emission estimates for ambient conditions. If wind tunnel air flow was adjusted to the ambient wind speed at height 0.25\u20130.30 m, then measured emissions were not significantly different from those measured using IHF methods. Wind tunnels influence the air flow pattern and cause turbulent convection in the air layers above the emitting surface, so the similarity in measured emissions for the two measuring techniques is perhaps surprising. This may be because the soil surface resistance to NH3 transport is often the most important rate\u2010regulating variable, so that the absence of a laminar boundary air layer resistance as caused by wind tunnels is of minor importance. It is concluded that the wind tunnels are well suited to test the emission reduction efficiency of new technologies.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "65b719976cd5071a8c8d5d5b34f2f77de409b569", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2218943479", "DOI": "10.1016/J.RSER.2015.11.037", "CorpusId": 111201618}, "title": "GHG emission reduction performance of state-of-the-art green buildings: Review of two case studies", "abstract": null, "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "bab49b36229bfdaaf5922c6e709d4cd215edefdb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2920952261", "DOI": "10.3390/SU11061528", "CorpusId": 159349396}, "title": "Linking between Renewable Energy, CO2 Emissions, and Economic Growth: Challenges for Candidates and Potential Candidates for the EU Membership", "abstract": "This paper investigates the impact of renewable energy sources (RESs), CO2 emissions, macroeconomics, and the political stability in a country on the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The authors analyse the dynamics of RESs use, CO2 emissions, and GDP development and also test the following hypotheses: (1) The country\u2019s economic growth is related to the energy consumption, in terms of both human resources and capital; (2) the share of the renewable energy consumption of the total energy consumption has a positive impact on the economic growth; and (3) the share of the renewable energy consumption of the total energy consumption is unrelated to the economic growth. To test the above hypotheses, the authors use the modified Cobb-Douglas production function, which also considers RES production volumes, CO2 emissions, and economic growth. The study employs data between 1995 to 2015 from the candidate and potential candidate countries for the EU membership. The data are drawn from the World Bank and Eurostat. The analyses entail panel unit root tests, Pedroni panel cointegration tests, fully modified OLS (FMOLS), dynamic OLS (DOLS) panel cointegration techniques, and the Vector Error Correction model (VECM). The findings confirm the relationship between RESs, CO2 emissions, and the GDP. For the EU countries, RESs as human resources and capital have an impact on the GDP. Moreover, the results reveal a correction retraction when the economic growth leads to an increase in renewable energy consumption. The investigation also finds that candidate and potential candidate countries for the EU membership should foster renewable energy development. The authors conclude that developing affordable and effective instruments and mechanisms to boost the RES implementation is necessary to decrease the anthropogenic impact on the environment (in particular, decreasing CO2 emissions) without any attendant reduction in the economic growth.", "year": 2019}, {"paperId": "f9fa40a878720c7ab0cd822feec1824a592c1942", "externalIds": {"DBLP": "journals/tie/MapelliTM10", "MAG": "2074495625", "DOI": "10.1109/TIE.2009.2029520", "CorpusId": 23714609}, "title": "Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicle: Modeling, Prototype Realization, and Inverter Losses Reduction Analysis", "abstract": "Nowadays, the greatest part of the effort to reduce pollution emissions is directed toward the hybridization of automotive drive trains.

In addition, in order to improve the driving range in an all-electric model (all-electric range), a detailed analysis of the inverter control was performed, because this component is one of the key components of the power train.
