Biomass-based energy sources can offset, or displace, some amount of fossil-fuel use. Energy derived from biomass provides 2 to 3% of the energy used in the U.S.A.; but, with the exception of corn-(Zea mays L.)-to-ethanol, very little energy is currently derived from dedicated energy crops. In addition to the fossil-fuel offset, energy cropping might also mitigate an accentuated greenhouse gas effect by causing a net sequestration of atmospheric C into soil organic C (SOC). Energy plantations of short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) or herbaceous crops (HC) can potentially be managed to favor SOC sequestration. This review is focused primarily on the potential to mitigate atmospheric CO2 emissions by fostering SOC sequestration in energy cropping systems deployed across the landscape in the United States. We know that land use affects the dynamics of the SOC pool, but data about spatial and temporal variability in the SOC pool under SRWC and HC are scanty due to lack of well-designed, long-term studies. The conventional methods of studying SOC fluxes involve paired-plot designs and chronosequences, but isotopic techniques may also be feasible in understanding temporal changes in SOC. The rate of accumulation of SOC depends on land-use history, soil type, vegetation type, harvesting cycle, and other management practices. The SOC pool tends to be enhanced more under deep-rooted grasses, N-fixers, and deciduous species. Carbon sequestration into recalcitrant forms in the SOC pool can be enhanced with some management practices (e.g., conservation tillage, fertilization, irrigation); but those practices can carry a fossil-C cost. Reported rates of SOC sequestration range from 0 to 1.6 Mg C ha\u22121 yr\u22121 under SRWC and 0 to 3 Mg C ha\u22121 yr\u22121 under HC. Production of 5 EJ of electricity from energy crops\u2014a perhaps reasonable scenario for the U.S.A.\u2014would require about 60 Mha. That amount of land is potentially available for conversion to energy plantations in the U.S.A. The land so managed could mitigate C emissions (through fossil C not emitted and SOC sequestered) by about 5.4 Mg C ha\u22121 yr\u22121. On 60 Mha, that would represent 324 Tg C yr\u22121\u2014a 20% reduction from current fossil-fuel CO2 emissions.

A series of strict emission control measures was implemented in Beijing and the surrounding seven provinces to ensure good air quality during the 2015 China Victory Day parade, rendering a unique opportunity to investigate the anthropogenic impact of aerosol properties. Submicron aerosol hygroscopicity and volatility were measured during and after the control period using a hygroscopic and volatile tandem differential mobility analyzer (H/V-TDMA) system. Three periods, namely the control clean period (Clean1), the non-control clean period (Clean2), and the non-control pollution period (Pollution), were selected to study the effect of the emission control measures on aerosol hygroscopicity and volatility. Aerosol particles became more hydrophobic and volatile due to the emission control measures. The hygroscopicity parameter (\u03ba) of 40\u2013200\u202fnm particles decreased by 32.0\u20138.5\u202f% during the Clean1 period relative to the Clean2 period, while the volatile shrink factor (SF) of 40\u2013300\u202fnm particles decreased by 7.5\u201310.5\u202f%. The emission controls also changed the diurnal variation patterns of both the probability density function of \u03ba (\u03ba-PDF) and the probability density function of SF (SF-PDF). During Clean1 the \u03ba-PDF showed one nearly hydrophobic (NH) mode for particles in the nucleation mode, which was likely due to the dramatic reduction in industrial emissions of inorganic trace gases. Compared to the Pollution period, particles observed during the Clean1 and Clean2 periods exhibited a more significant nonvolatile (NV) mode throughout the day, suggesting a more externally mixed state particularly for the 150\u202fnm particles. Aerosol hygroscopicities increased as particle sizes increased, with the greatest increases seen during the Pollution period. Accordingly, the aerosol volatility became weaker (i.e., SF increased) as particle sizes increased during the Clean1 and Clean2 periods, but no apparent trend was observed during the Pollution period.

Using a case study in the Bale Mountains in Ethiopia, we exemplify the implications of primary and secondary forest carbon stock estimates on predicted REDD project emission reductions and revenues.

Although many cities have set voluntary climate plans, their CO2 emissions are not evaluated by the monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) procedures that play a key role for market- or policy-based mitigation actions. Here we analyze the potential of a monitoring tool that could support the development of such procedures at the city scale. It is based on an atmospheric inversion method that exploits inventory data and continuous atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements from a network of stations within and around cities to estimate city CO2 emissions. This monitoring tool is configured for the quantification of the total and sectoral CO2 emissions in the Paris metropolitan area (\u223c 12 million inhabitants and 11.4\u202fTgC emitted in 2010) during the month of January 2011. Its performances are evaluated in terms of uncertainty reduction based on observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). They are analyzed as a function of the number of sampling sites (measuring at 25\u202fm\u202fa.g.l.) and as a function of the network design. The instruments presently used to measure CO2 concentrations at research stations are expensive (typically \u223c EUR\u202f50\u202fk per sensor), which has limited the few current pilot city networks to around 10 sites. Larger theoretical networks are studied here to assess the potential benefit of hypothetical operational lower-cost sensors. The setup of our inversion system is based on a number of diagnostics and assumptions from previous city-scale inversion experiences with real data. We find that, given our assumptions underlying the configuration of the OSSEs, with 10 stations only the uncertainty for the total city CO2 emission during 1 month is significantly reduced by the inversion by \u223c 42\u202f%. It can be further reduced by extending the network, e.g., from 10 to 70 stations, which is promising for MRV applications in the Paris metropolitan area. With 70 stations, the uncertainties in the inverted emissions are reduced significantly over those obtained using 10 stations: by 32\u202f% for commercial and residential buildings, by 33\u202f% for road transport, by 18\u202f% for the production of energy by power plants, and by 31\u202f% for total emissions. These results indicate that such a high number of stations would be likely required for the monitoring of sectoral emissions in Paris using this observation\u2013model framework.

We compile spatial data on global forest carbon, biodiversity, deforestation rates, and the opportunity cost of land to examine biodiversity conservation benefits from an international program to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation.

Statistically significant downward trends (computed using the nonparametric Theil-Sen method) in annual on-road CO, NOx, and VOC emissions of 6.1%, 3.3%, and 6.0% per year, respectively, are noted during the 1995\u20132009 period despite an increase in total vehicle distance traveled. The CO and NOx emission trends are correlated with statistically significant downward trends in ambient air concentrations of CO and NOx in Atlanta ranging from 8.0% to 11.8% per year and from 5.8% to 8.7% per year, respectively, during similar time periods. Weather-adjusted summertime ozone concentrations in Atlanta exhibited a statistically significant declining trend of 2.3% per year during 2001\u20132009. Although this trend coexists with the declining trends in on-road NOx, VOC, and CO emissions, identifying the cause of the downward trend in ozone is complicated by reductions in multiple precursors from different source sectors. Implications: Large reductions in on-road vehicle emissions of CO and NOx in Atlanta from the late 1990s to 2009, despite an increase in total vehicle distance traveled, contributed to a significant improvement in air quality through decreases in ambient air concentrations of CO and NOx during this time period. Emissions reductions in motor vehicles and other source sectors resulted in these improvements and the observed declining trend in ozone concentrations over the past decade.

Total Hg deposition in Mainland China is estimated to be 422 Mg/year, and approximately two thirds of the deposition is contributed by domestic emissions. The net Hg transport budget from Mainland China is 511 Mg/year, contributing to 10% of Hg deposition in other regions of the world. This reassessment points to a ~25% reduction in total annual outflow compared to the previous estimate by Lin et al. (2010, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp\u201010\u20101853\u20102010). Such reduction is mainly caused by changes in Hg emission quantity, speciation, and spatial/temporal distributions. More modeling studies focusing on reducing uncertainties of emission inventories and Hg atmospheric chemistry are needed for continuous assessment of Hg emission outflow in this emission\u2010intensive region.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "60a2ac48ea458f007bff58d283c1fcfcb89480d3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2117959605", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-007-9391-8", "CorpusId": 15423552}, "title": "Atmospheric stabilization and the timing of carbon mitigation", "abstract": "Stabilization of atmospheric CO2 concentrations below a pre-industrial doubling (~550\u00a0ppm) is a commonly cited target in climate policy assessment. When the rate at which future emissions can fall is assumed to be fixed, the peak atmospheric concentration \u2013 or the stabilization \u201cfrontier\u201d \u2013 is an increasing and convex function of the length of postponement. Here we find that a decline in emissions of 1% year\u22121 beginning today would place the frontier near 475\u00a0ppm and that when mitigation is postponed, options disappear (on average) at the rate of ~9\u00a0ppm year\u22121, meaning that delays of more than a decade will likely preclude stabilization below a doubling. When constraints on the future decline rate of emissions are relaxed, a particular atmospheric target can be realized in many ways, with scenarios that allow longer postponement of emissions reductions requiring greater increases in the intensity of future mitigation. However, the marginal rate of substitution between future mitigation and present delay becomes prohibitively large when the balance is shifted too far toward the future, meaning that some amount of postponement cannot be fully offset by simply increasing the intensity of future mitigation. Consequently, these results suggest that a practical transition path to a given stabilization target in the most commonly cited range can allow, at most, one or two decades of delay.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "7fa3cb1d38472799e9a2b115e36fd3ec0c317fd2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2119845572", "DOI": "10.1063/1.1850595", "CorpusId": 56414733}, "title": "Low-loss and directional output ZnO thin-film ridge waveguide random lasers with MgO capped layer", "abstract": "Room-temperature ultraviolet lasing characteristics of ZnO thin-film ridge-waveguide random lasers with MgO capped layer fabricated on n-type (100) Si substrate are reported.

When the impacts of lime application and soil N2O emissions were excluded for more direct comparison with prior results published by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), the reduction was 85.4%. This is a significant improvement over the 78.5% GHG reduction reported in the NREL study. Agricultural lime accounted for 50.6% of GHG from all agricultural inputs. Soil N2O accounted for 18.0% of total agricultural emissions. The improvement in overall GHG reduction was primarily due to lower agricultural energy usage and improved soybean crushing facilities. This study found that soybean meal and oil price data from the past ten years had a significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.73); hence, it is argued that soybean meal and oil are both responsible for indirect land use change from increased soybean demand. It is concluded that when there is a strong price correlation among co-products, system boundary expansion without a proper co-product allocation for indirect land use change produces erroneous results.

It is reported there is a higher percentage of Hg(0) in the flue gas when burning sub-bituminous coal (herein Powder River Basin (PRB) coal) and lignite, even with the use of selective catalytic reduction (SCR). The higher Hg(0)concentration in the flue gas makes it difficult to use the wet-FGD process for the mercury emission control in coal-fired utility boilers. Investigation of enhanced Hg(0) oxidation by addition of hydrogen halogens (HF, HCl, HBr, and HI) was conducted in a slipstream reactor with and without SCR catalysts when burning PRB coal. Two commercial SCR catalysts were evaluated. SCR catalyst no. 1 showed higher efficiencies of both NO reduction and Hg(0) oxidation than those of SCR catalyst no. 2. NH3 addition seemed to inhibit the Hg(0) oxidation, which indicated competitive processes between NH3 reduction and Hg(0) oxidation on the surface of SCR catalysts. The hydrogen halogens, in the order of impact on Hg(0) oxidation, were HBr, HI, and HCl or HF. Addition of HBr at approximately 3 ppm could achieve 80% Hg(0) oxidation. Addition of HI at approximately 5 ppm could achieve 40% Hg(0) oxidation. In comparison to the empty reactor, 40% Hg(0) oxidation could be achieved when HCl addition was up to 300 ppm. The enhanced Hg(0) oxidation by addition of HBr and HI seemed not to be correlated to the catalytic effects by both evaluated SCR catalysts. The effectiveness of conversion of hydrogen halogens to halogen molecules or interhalogens seemed to be attributed to their impacts on Hg(0) oxidation.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "27a09ff9f3386894c084497425655024c19dfdb3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2130026319", "DOI": "10.2139/ssrn.1444810", "CorpusId": 5896854}, "title": "Linking Reduced Deforestation and a Global Carbon Market: Impacts on Costs, Financial Flows, and Technological Innovation", "abstract": "Discussions over tropical deforestation are currently at the forefront of climate change policy negotiations at national, regional, and international levels. This paper analyzes the effects of linking Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) to a global market for greenhouse gas emission reductions. We supplement a global climate-energy-economy model with alternative cost estimates for reducing deforestation emissions in order to examine a global program for stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations at 550 ppmv of CO2 equivalent. Introducing REDD reduces global forestry emissions through 2050 by 20-22% in the Brazil-only case and by 64-88% in the global REDD scenarios. At the same time, REDD lowers the total costs of the climate policy by an estimated 10-25% depending on which tropical countries participate and whether the \u201cbanking\u201d of excess credits for use in future periods is allowed. As a result, REDD could enable additional reductions of at least 20 ppmv of CO2-equivalent concentrations with no added costs compared to an energy-sector only policy. The cost savings from REDD are magnified if banking is allowed and there is a need to increase the stringency of global climate policy in the future in response, for example, to new scientific information. Results also indicate that REDD decreases carbon prices in 2050 by 8-23% with banking and 11-26% without banking. While developing regions, particularly Latin America, gain the value of REDD opportunities, the decrease in the carbon price keeps the value of international carbon market flows relatively stable despite an increase in volumes transacted. We also estimate that REDD generally reduces the total portfolio of investments and research and development of new energy technologies by 1-10%. However, due to impacts on the relative prices of different fossil fuels, REDD has a slight positive estimated effect on investments in coal-related technologies (IGCC and CCS) as well as, in some cases, non-electric energy R&D. This research confirms that integrating REDD into global carbon markets can provide powerful incentives for the preservation of tropical forests while lowering the costs of global climate change protection and providing valuable policy flexibility.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "505dcb4ecedc0cd18c8e3bd474bba8e3058f97c2", "externalIds": {"DOI": "10.1038/s41561-021-00690-8", "CorpusId": 231931223}, "title": "Increased carbon footprint of materials production driven by rise in investments", "abstract": "The production of materials is an important source of greenhouse gas emissions.

Here, I quantify the greenhouse gas emissions from material production and the carbon footprint of materials in industries that are the first users of materials, and in final consumption, using a multiregional input\u2013output model of the global economy and the hypothetical extraction method. From 1995 to 2015, greenhouse gas emissions from just material production increased by 120%, with 11 billion tons of CO2-equivalent emitted in 2015. As a proportion of global emissions, material production rose from 15 to 23%. China accounted for 75% of the growth. In terms of the first use of materials, two-fifths of the carbon footprint of materials is attributed to construction, and two-fifths to the manufacturing of machinery, vehicles and other durable products. Overall, the replacement of existing or formation of new capital stocks now accounts for 60% of material-related emissions. Policies that address the rapidly growing capital stocks in emerging economies therefore offer the best prospect for emission reductions from material efficiency.

Our analysis reveals that economic growth and CO 2 emissions are positively correlated during expansions but not during recessions. Moreover, we find that rising nuclear energy consumption leads to decreased CO 2 emissions during expansions, while the impact of increasing renewable energy consumption on emissions is negative but insignificant. In addition, there is a positive feedback between nuclear energy consumption and economic growth, but unidirectional positive causality running from renewable energy consumption to economic growth in upturns. Our findings do indicate that both nuclear and renewable energy consumption contribute to a reduction in emissions; however, the rise in economic activity, leading to a greater increase in emissions, offsets this positive impact of green energy.

We correlated CMRO2 to cerebral electrophysiology and examined the effects of hyperventilation on the amplitude of the cortical somatosensory evoked potential response. Patients showed higher ischemic brain volume than controls (17 \u00b1 22 vs. 2 \u00b1 3 mL; p \u2264 .05), with worse matching of oxygen delivery to demand (p < .001). Hyperventilation consistently reduced cerebral blood flow (p < .001) and resulted in increases in oxygen extraction fraction and ischemic brain volume (17 \u00b1 22 vs. 88 \u00b1 66 mL; p < .0001), which were undetected by SjO2 monitoring. Mean CMRO2 was slightly increased following hyperventilation, but responses were extremely variable, with 28% of patients demonstrating a decrease in CMRO2 that exceeded 95% prediction intervals for zero change in one or more regions. CMRO2 correlated with cerebral electrophysiology, and cortical somatosensory evoked potential amplitudes were significantly increased by hyperventilation. Conclusions:The acute cerebral blood flow reduction and increase in CMRO2 secondary to hyperventilation represent physiologic challenges to the traumatized brain. These challenges exhaust physiologic reserves in a proportion of brain regions in many subjects and compromise oxidative metabolism. Such ischemia is underestimated by common bedside monitoring tools and may represent a significant mechanism of avoidable neuronal injury following head trauma.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "1b0f25f4c0adc9292ce3e9ab465a915e2246bcd3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2107555889", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-12-6095-2012", "CorpusId": 32804610}, "title": "Nested-grid simulation of mercury over North America", "abstract": "Abstract. We have developed a new nested-grid mercury (Hg) simulation over North America with a 1/2\u00b0 latitude by 2/3\u00b0 longitude horizontal resolution employing the GEOS-Chem global chemical transport model. Emissions, chemistry, deposition, and meteorology are self-consistent between the global and nested domains. Compared to the global model (4\u00b0 latitude by 5\u00b0 longitude), the nested model shows improved skill at capturing the high spatial and temporal variability of Hg wet deposition over North America observed by the Mercury Deposition Network (MDN) in 2008\u20132009. The nested simulation resolves features such as higher deposition due to orographic precipitation, land/ocean contrast and and predicts more efficient convective rain scavenging of Hg over the southeast United States. However, the nested model overestimates Hg wet deposition over the Ohio River Valley region (ORV) by 27%. We modify anthropogenic emission speciation profiles in the US EPA National Emission Inventory (NEI) to account for the rapid in-plume reduction of reactive to elemental Hg (IPR simulation). This leads to a decrease in the model bias to \u22122.3% over the ORV region. Over the contiguous US, the correlation coefficient (r) between MDN observations and our IPR simulation increases from 0.60 to 0.78. The IPR nested simulation generally reproduces the seasonal cycle in surface concentrations of speciated Hg from the Atmospheric Mercury Network (AMNet) and Canadian Atmospheric Mercury Network (CAMNet). In the IPR simulation, annual mean gaseous and particulate-bound Hg(II) are within 140% and 11% of observations, respectively. In contrast, the simulation with unmodified anthropogenic Hg speciation profiles overestimates these observations by factors of 4 and 2 for gaseous and particulate-bound Hg(II), respectively. The nested model shows improved skill at capturing the horizontal variability of Hg observed over California during the ARCTAS aircraft campaign. The nested model suggests that North American anthropogenic emissions account for 10\u201322% of Hg wet deposition flux over the US, depending on the anthropogenic emissions speciation profile assumed.

Simulation results from PEV-CIM indicate that battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVS) offer a great potential to drastically reduce GHG emissions in the provinces of Que\u0301bec and Ontario thanks to the low emission intensity of their electrical grids. However, the slow turnover of the light duty vehicle fleet limits the overall emission reduction of the provincial fleets for the year 2025 to only 5-12%.

Its GHG emission intensity is higher than the threshold of 720 gCO2 eq per kWh at which the emissions of BEVs and PHEVs are equal to those of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs).

This paper describes a modelling approach that integrates a wood product substitution model, a global partial equilibrium model, a regional forest model and a stand-level model. Three different scenarios were compared with a business-as-usual scenario over a 23-year period (2008\u20132030). Two scenarios assumed an additional one million apartment flats per year will be built of wood instead of non-wood materials by 2030. These scenarios had little effect on markets and forest management and reduced annual carbon emissions by 0.2\u20130.5% of the total 1990 European GHG emissions. However, the scenarios are associated with high specific CO2 emission reductions per unit of wood used. The third scenario, an extreme assumption that all European countries will consume 1-m3 sawn wood per capita by 2030, had large effects on carbon emission, volumes and trade flows. The price changes of this scenario, however, also affected forest management in ways that greatly deviated from the partial equilibrium model projections. Our results suggest that increased wood construction will have a minor impact on forest management and forest carbon stocks. To analyse larger perturbations on the demand side, a market equilibrium model seems crucial. However, for that analytical system to work properly, the market and forest regional models must be better synchronized than here, in particular regarding assumptions on timber supply behaviour.

Gas flaring is a widely used practice for the disposal of associated gas in oil production and processing facilities where there is insufficient infrastructure for utilization of the gas (primarily methane). Improved utilization of the gas is key to reducing global carbon emissions to the atmosphere. The DMSP estimates of flared gas volume are based on a calibration developed with a pooled set of reported national gas flaring volumes and data from individual flares. Flaring efficiency was calculated as the volume of flared gas per barrel of crude oil produced. Global gas flaring has remained largely stable over the past fifteen years, in the range of 140 to 170 billion cubic meters (BCM). Global flaring efficiency was in the seven to eight cubic meters per barrel from 1994 to 2005 and declined to 5.6 m 3 per barrel by 2008. The 2008 gas flaring estimate of 139 BCM represents 21% of the natural gas consumption of the USA with a potential retail market value of $68 billion. The 2008 flaring added more than 278 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) into the atmosphere. The DMSP estimated gas flaring volumes indicate that global gas flaring has declined by 19% since 2005, led by gas flaring reductions in Russia and Nigeria, the two countries with the highest gas flaring levels. The flaring efficiency of both Russia and Nigeria improved from 2005 to 2008, suggesting that the reductions in gas flaring are likely the result of either improved utilization of the gas, reinjection, or direct venting of gas into the atmosphere, although the effect of uncertainties in the satellite data cannot be ruled out.

Methods\u2014 For 41 patients with unilateral carotid stenosis \u226570%, CBF and cerebral vasoreactivity (CVR) were investigated with resting and acetazolamide-challenge single photon emission CT before CEA. CBF 1 day after CEA was also measured. Three-dimensional stereotactic surface projection (3D-SSP) analysis of CBF changes was performed by use of a control database of 20 subjects. Results\u2014 Patients with reduced CVR (CVR <10%, n=15) were categorized into 2 groups based on the severity of CBF reduction relative to the control database by 3D-SSP analysis without normalization: type I (ipsilateral CBF decrease <20%, n=8) and type II (ipsilateral CBF decrease \u226520%, n=7). With thalamic normalization, the patients were also categorized into 2 groups: type A (ipsilateral Z score \u22642, n=10) and type B (ipsilateral Z score >2, n=5). Severe CBF reduction (\u226520% or Z score >2) was significantly associated with postoperative hyperperfusion (CBF increase \u2265100%).

The CH4 emissions of the year of 2006 (2.11\u00b13.48 mg CH4 m\u22122 h\u22121) were 82% lower than the mean value of the years 2005 and 2007 (13.91\u00b117.80 mg CH4 m\u22122 h\u22121 and 9.44\u00b114.32 mg CH4 m\u22122 h\u22121, respectively), responding to the inter-annual changes of standing water depths during the growing season of the three years. Significant drawdown of standing water depth is believed to cause such significant reduction in CH4 emissions from wetlands in the year 2006, probably through changing the methanogen composition and decreasing its community size as well as activating methanotrophs to enhance CH4 oxidation.

We hypothesized that there is microglial activation early on in Alzheimer's disease trajectory, where in the initial phase, microglia may be trying to repair the damage, while later on in the disease these microglia could be ineffective and produce proinflammatory cytokines leading to progressive neuronal damage. In this longitudinal study, we have evaluated the temporal profile of microglial activation and its relationship between fibrillar amyloid load at baseline and follow-up in subjects with mild cognitive impairment, and this was compared with subjects with Alzheimer's disease. Thirty subjects (eight mild cognitive impairment, eight Alzheimer's disease and 14 controls) aged between 54 and 77 years underwent 11C-(R)PK11195, 11C-PIB positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans. Patients were followed-up after 14 \u00b1 4 months. Region of interest and Statistical Parametric Mapping analysis were used to determine longitudinal alterations. Single subject analysis was performed to evaluate the individualized pathological changes over time. Correlations between levels of microglial activation and amyloid deposition at a voxel level were assessed using Biological Parametric Mapping. We demonstrated that both baseline and follow-up microglial activation in the mild cognitive impairment cohort compared to controls were increased by 41% and 21%, respectively. There was a longitudinal reduction of 18% in microglial activation in mild cognitive impairment cohort over 14 months, which was associated with a mild elevation in fibrillar amyloid load. Cortical clusters of microglial activation and amyloid deposition spatially overlapped in the subjects with mild cognitive impairment. Baseline microglial activation was increased by 36% in Alzheimer's disease subjects compared with controls. Longitudinally, Alzheimer's disease subjects showed an increase in microglial activation. In conclusion, this is one of the first longitudinal positron emission tomography studies evaluating longitudinal changes in microglial activation in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease subjects. We found there is an initial longitudinal reduction in microglial activation in subjects with mild cognitive impairment, while subjects with Alzheimer's disease showed an increase in microglial activation. This could reflect that activated microglia in mild cognitive impairment initially may adopt a protective activation phenotype, which later change to a cidal pro-inflammatory phenotype as disease progresses and amyloid clearance fails. Thus, we speculate that there might be two peaks of microglial activation in the Alzheimer's disease trajectory; an early protective peak and a later pro-inflammatory peak. If so, anti-microglial agents targeting the pro-inflammatory phenotype would be most beneficial in the later stages of the disease.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "c69a18b3a91b33db3ddf63feefbaafd435e52fd2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1973964868", "DOI": "10.3141/1987-02", "CorpusId": 108761111}, "title": "Impact of Electronic Toll Collection and Electronic Screening on Heavy-Duty Vehicle Emissions", "abstract": "The proliferation of electronic toll collection (ETC) mechanisms such as E-ZPass has a positive effect in reducing automobile emissions at toll plazas because of decreased acceleration, deceleration, and idling events.

No such tools exist for modeling of the emissions impacts of ETC and e-screening facilities on heavy-duty vehicle operations. This paper presents a speed profile discretization (SPD) technique for modeling emissions at ETC and e-screening facilities. The SPD technique is based on the MOBILE6.2 method of representing vehicle miles of travel in various speed bins. The technique defines an emissions influence zone within which speed profiles are altered and further determine vehicle emissions. With this technique, the emissions impacts of heavy-duty trucks at the toll collection plaza on the George Washington Bridge in New York City are estimated. The current mix of cash and E-ZPass transactions on the George Washington Bridge are shown to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), hydrocarbons (HCs), and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) within the emissions influence zone. The degree of reduction is dependent on the speed with which E-ZPass vehicles are processed. If E-ZPass vehicles are processed at no more than 10 mph, reductions in VOC, CO, and NOx emissions are estimated to be 30.8%, 23.5%, and 5.8%, respectively.

Quantification of the benefits of previous emissions controls conveys the value of these regulatory actions and provides a method by which future control alternatives could be evaluated. In this study we use the adjoint of the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to estimate highly-resolved spatial distributions of benefits related to emission reductions for six urban regions within the continental US. Emissions from outside each of the six chosen regions account for between 7% and 27% of the premature deaths attributed to exposure to BC within the region. While we estimate that nonroad mobile and onroad diesel emissions account for the largest number of premature deaths attributable to exposure to BC, onroad gasoline is shown to have more than double the benefit per unit emission relative to that of nonroad mobile and onroad diesel. Within the region encompassing New York City and Philadelphia, reductions in emissions from large industrial combustion sources that are not classified as EGUs (i.e., non-EGU) are estimated to have up to triple the benefits per unit emission relative to reductions to onroad diesel sectors, and provide similar benefits per unit emission to that of onroad gasoline emissions in the region.

Public transit is more energy efficient on major urban corridors. Some transit improvements, such as bus lanes and faster loading, increase operating efficiency. High quality transit can leverage additional energy savings by stimulating transit-oriented development and by supporting other energy conservation strategies such as pricing reforms. High quality transit can provide other savings and benefits in addition to energy conservation and emission reductions.

Under denitrifying incubation conditions, much more N2O was formed (0.91 \u03bcmol gdw\u22121 after 48 h).

Dietary choices are important to address, as many studies find that activities related to food production account for nearly 20\u201330% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Nonetheless, while GHG emissions are important, often other environmental impact categories are not considered in the assessment of the sustainability of different foods, diets and choices. This study aims to quantify the implications of dietary choices for Swedish food consumption on a broad range of environmental impact categories using life cycle assessment to provide insight into the impacts, and potential tradeoffs, associated with certain food products and dietary choices. Scenarios are used to assess the implications of diets with reduced meat, increased Swedish food consumption, increased organic foods, vegan and semi-vegetarian diets. The results indicate that tradeoffs could be possible with certain dietary choices. Increasing Swedish food production and consumption may lead to lower impacts for all impact categories by reducing imports, although limitations in growing season and availability of foods in Sweden allows only for minor increases. The results also indicate that large reductions of greenhouse gas emissions are possible by reducing meat consumption, i.e., by halving meat consumption and through vegan and vegetarian diets. Nonetheless, an increase in vegetable, legume and fruit products may lead to a potential increase in human and ecosystem toxicity. Diets based on nutritional guidelines, show reductions in all impact categories, as these guidelines call for an increase in vegetables and fruits and a reduction in meat consumption. An increase in organic foods showed no significant change in climate impact, although toxicity potential was reduced significantly.

We develop a unified framework that considers the supply of offsets within a cap-and-trade program that allows us to compare the relative impact of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions on overall emissions under different levels of baseline stringency and carbon prices. In the context of a national carbon pricing scheme that includes offsets, we find that the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets can be fully balanced out by under-credited emissions reductions without sacrificing a significant portion of the overall supply of offsets, provided emissions baselines are stringent enough. In the presence of high predicted business-as-usual (BAU) emissions uncertainty or low carbon prices, to maintain the environmental integrity of the program, baselines need to be set at stringent levels, in some cases below 50 percent of predicted BAU emissions. As predicted BAU emissions uncertainty declines or as the carbon market achieves higher equilibrium prices, however, less stringent baselines can balance out the emissions impacts of over-credited offsets and under-credited emissions reductions.

There is increasing demand for measuring not only the concentration, but also the size distribution of the particulates. Laser-induced incandescence has emerged as a promising technique for measuring spatially and temporally resolved particulate volume fraction and size. Laser-induced incandescence has orders of magnitude more sensitivity than the gravimetric technique, and thus offers the promise of real-time measurements and adds the increasingly desirable size and morphology information. The usefulness of LII as a diagnostic instrument for the precise measurement of particulate concentration and primary particle size has been demonstrated. Measurements have been performed in the exhaust of a single cylinder DI research diesel engine. Simultaneous gravimetric filter measurements were made for direct comparison with the LII technique. Quantitative LII is shown to provide a sensitive, precise, and repeatable measure of the particulate concentration over a wide dynamic range. LII and gravimetric measurements are shown to correlate well over a wide range of operating conditions. A novel method for determining the primary particle size is shown to be precise enough to distinguish particle sizes for different engine operating conditions, and subsequently the number density of primary particles was determined. LII has also been shown to be sensitive in differentiating the PM performance between four different fuels. The LII technique is capable of real-time particulate matter measurements over any engine transient operation. The wide dynamic range and lower detection limit of LII make it a potentially preferred standard instrument for particulate matter measurements. INTRODUCTION From an environmental perspective, there is an urgent need to decrease the total emissions from transportation engines. The undesirable exhaust emissions include CO2, NOx, and particulate matter (PM). CO2 is a recognized greenhouse gas, and as a result of the Kyoto Protocol, industrialized countries have committed to reducing emissions of CO2. This can be primarily achieved by reductions in fuel consumption, and diesel engines offer the highest efficiency for road-going vehicles. The concession is that the emissions reduction systems for other pollutants are not as well developed for diesel engines as they are for spark-ignited engines. Demand for improved environmental performance has led to increasingly restrictive emission regulations for diesel-powered vehicles throughout Europe, North America, and Japan. Proposed regulations indicate that this trend to lower emissions levels will continue for the foreseeable future. Although PM is regulated for environmental reasons, from an operational point of view, particulate formation is not desirable. A significant portion of atmospheric particulates arises from combustion of fuels in various engines and furnaces. In urban areas, mobile sources are major contributors to ambient PM concentrations. The particulate emissions from diesel engines are in the form of complex aerosols consisting primarily of soot and volatile organics. For regulatory purposes, particulate matter emissions are defined as the mass of the matter that can be collected from a diluted exhaust stream on a filter kept at 52\u00b0C. This includes the organic compounds that condense at lower temperatures, but excludes the condensed water. This measurement provides the timeaveraged PM emissions over the period during which the particulates are collected on the filter, making measurements of the transient behavior of PM emissions impractical.

Increased DSF is found to cause only a minor (less than 3%) reduction in consumers\u2019 cost of electricity. VRE revenues are found to increase (up to 5% and\u00a0 2% for wind and solar power, respectively), and total VRE curtailment decreases by up to 7.2 TWh. Increased DSF causes only limited reductions in GHG emissions. The emission reduction is, however, sensitive to underlying assumptions.

These tissues were characterized using multiple excitation wavelength fluorescence spectroscopy and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy in the ultraviolet-visible wavelength range, immediately after excision. Spectra were then analyzed using principal component analysis (PCA) as a data reduction technique. PCA was performed on each fluorescence spectrum, as well as on the diffuse reflectance spectrum individually, to establish a set of principal components for each spectrum. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to determine which principal components show statistically significant differences between malignant and nonmalignant tissues. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was utilized to classify the samples based on the diagnostically useful principal components. Cross-validation of this nonparametric algorithm was carried out to determine its classification accuracy in an unbiased manner. Multiexcitation fluorescence spectroscopy was successful in discriminating malignant and nonmalignant tissues, with a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 92%, respectively. The sensitivity (30%) and specificity (78%) of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy alone was significantly lower. Combining fluorescence and diffuse reflectance spectra did not improve the classification accuracy of an algorithm based on fluorescence spectra alone.

To ensure good air quality for the Games, several temporary emission control measures were implemented in Beijing and surrounding areas. Ambient particulate matter concentration decreased significantly during the Olympic period; however, it is difficult to distinguish the effectiveness of those control measures since meteorology also affects ambient PM2.5 concentration. In this work, a multiple linear regression model based on continuous field monitoring at a roadside site was conducted to evaluate the effects of meteorology and emission control measures on the reduction of PM2.5 during the 2008 Olympic Games. The hourly data set was divided into two time periods, the no control period, June 22nd to July 4th, and the control period, July 28th to August 21st. The response variable was PM2.5 and the meteorology covariates used in the model were hourly temperature, dew point temperature, wind speed and precipitation. Wind direction was not a significant predictor of PM2.5 levels in either the control or the no control period. Using the meteorologically-based regression coefficients from the two time periods, meteorology was found to contribute to at least a 16% reduction in PM2.5 levels in the roadside microenvironment; while the pollution control measures contributed to at least a 43% reduction in PM2.5 levels.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "a7cd3e3c78793546570f397aea9d92d96ff4944c", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "5047777", "MAG": "2344772925", "DOI": "10.1289/EHP209", "CorpusId": 22291515, "PubMed": "27128166"}, "title": "Neurodevelopmental Deceleration by Urban Fine Particles from Different Emission Sources: A Longitudinal Observational Study", "abstract": "Background: A few studies have reported associations between traffic-related air pollution exposure at schools and cognitive development. The role of PM components or sources other than traffic on cognitive development has been little explored. Objectives: We aimed to explore the role of PM sources in school air on cognitive development. Methods: A cohort of 2,618 schoolchildren (average age, 8.5 years) belonging to 39 schools in Barcelona (Spain) was followed up for a year. Children completed computerized tests assessing working memory, superior working memory, and inattentiveness during four visits. Particulate matter \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm (PM2.5) was measured during two 1-week campaigns in each school, both outdoors and in the classroom. Source apportionment resulted in nine sources: mineral, organic/textile/chalk, traffic, secondary sulfate and organics, secondary nitrate, road dust, metallurgy, sea spray, and heavy oil combustion. Differences in cognitive growth trajectories were assessed with mixed models with age-by-source interaction terms. Results: An interquartile range increase in indoor traffic-related PM2.5 was associated with reductions in cognitive growth equivalent to 22% (95% CI: 2%, 42%) of the annual change in working memory, 30% (95% CI: 6%, 54%) of the annual change in superior working memory, and 11% (95% CI: 0%, 22%) of the annual change in the inattentiveness scale. None of the other PM2.5 sources was associated with adverse effects on cognitive development. Conclusions: Traffic was the only source of fine particles associated with a reduction in cognitive development. Reducing air pollution from traffic at primary schools may result in beneficial effects on cognition.
