The rapid development of the economy has been accompanied by a surge in carbon emissions. How to achieve a win-win situation for economic growth and carbon emissions reduction has aroused widespread concern from all sectors of society. Here, this paper discusses the dynamic relationship of industrial structure upgrading, economic growth, and carbon emission reduction. Results show that there is a long-term equilibrium relationship among industrial structure upgrading, economic growth, and carbon emissions.

Carbon emission reduction promotes industrial structure upgrading. Industrial structure upgrading has a greater positive impact on economic growth. Industrial structure upgrading and economic growth have a negative impact on carbon emissions, thereby promoting emission reduction. And at the 10% significance level, there is a one-way Granger causality from carbon emissions to industrial structure upgrading, economic growth can cause one-way changes in carbon emissions, and industrial structure upgrading is a one-way Granger cause of economic growth.

In 2013, China's government published the Air Pollution Prevention and\nControl Action Plan (APPCAP) with a specific target for Beijing, which aims\nto reduce annual mean PM2.5 concentrations in Beijing to\n60\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123 in 2017. During 2013\u20132017, the air quality in\nBeijing was significantly improved following the implementation of various\nemission control measures locally and regionally, with the annual mean\nPM2.5 concentration decreasing from 89.5\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123 in 2013\nto 58\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123 in 2017. As meteorological conditions were more\nfavourable to the reduction of air pollution in 2017 than in 2013 and 2016,\nthe real effectiveness of emission control measures on the improvement of air\nquality in Beijing has frequently been questioned. In this work, by combining a detailed bottom-up emission inventory over\nBeijing, the MEIC regional emission inventory and the WRF-CMAQ (Weather\nResearch and Forecasting Model and Community Multiscale Air Quality) model, we\nattribute the improvement in Beijing's PM2.5 air quality in 2017\n(compared to 2013 and 2016) to the following factors: changes in\nmeteorological conditions, reduction of emissions from surrounding regions,\nand seven specific categories of local emission control measures in Beijing.\nWe collect and summarize data related to 32 detailed control measures\nimplemented during 2013\u20132017, quantify the emission reductions associated\nwith each measure using the bottom-up local emission inventory in 2013,\naggregate the measures into seven categories, and conduct a series of CMAQ\nsimulations to quantify the contribution of different factors to the\nPM2.5 changes. We found that, although changes in meteorological conditions partly explain\nthe improved PM2.5 air quality in Beijing in 2017 compared to 2013 (3.8\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123,\n12.1\u2009% of total), the rapid decrease in\nPM2.5 concentrations in Beijing during 2013\u20132017 was dominated by local\n(20.6\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123, 65.4\u2009%) and regional (7.1\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123,\n22.5\u2009%) emission reductions. The seven categories of\nemission control measures, i.e. coal-fired boiler control,\nclean fuels in the residential sector, optimize industrial structure,\nfugitive dust control, vehicle emission control,\nimproved end-of-pipe control, and integrated treatment of VOCs,\nreduced the PM2.5\nconcentrations in Beijing by 5.9, 5.3, 3.2, 2.3, 1.9, 1.8, and 0.2\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123,\nrespectively, during 2013\u20132017. We also found\nthat changes in meteorological conditions could explain roughly 30\u2009% of\ntotal reduction in PM2.5 concentration during 2016\u20132017 with more\nprominent contribution in winter months (November and December). If the\nmeteorological conditions in 2017 had remained the same as those in 2016,\nthe annual mean PM2.5 concentrations would have increased from\n58 to 63\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123, exceeding the\ntarget established in the APPCAP. Despite the remarkable impacts from\nmeteorological condition changes, local and regional emission reductions\nstill played major roles in the PM2.5 decrease in Beijing during\n2016\u20132017, and clean fuels in the residential sector, coal-fired boiler control,\nand optimize industrial structure were the three most effective local measures\n(contributing reductions of 2.1, 1.9, and 1.5\u2009\u00b5g\u2009m\u22123,\nrespectively).

To this end, a methodology is proposed to aggregate emission reduction goals of the most significant and potentially impactful global initiatives. We identified the extent to which reductions are additional to national policies, assuming these actions do not displace climate actions elsewhere, and accounted for overlap ranges between the ICIs. The analysis was conducted for 17 initiatives, selected from an original list of over 300 with a series of testing criteria, across eight sectors and ten major emitting economies. These initiatives include cities, regions, businesses, and other subnational and non-state actors, cooperating with each other and sometimes working in partnership with national governments or other international organizations. Our analysis shows that the combined achievement of initiatives\u2019 reduction goals could reduce global emissions in 2030 by 18\u201321 GtCO2e/year in addition to current national policies (total of 60\u201363 GtCO2e/year), down to 39\u201344 GtCO2e/year. If delivered fully, reductions from these 17 initiatives would help move the global emissions trajectory within the range of a 2\u00b0C-consistent emission pathway by 2030, although a significant gap would remain to reduce emissions to a 1.5\u00b0C-consistent pathway. Key policy insights We propose a transparent and robust methodology to aggregate GHG mitigation potential of ICIs, accounting for overlaps between ICIs. If major initiatives meet their goals and do not change the course of other existing climate actions, they could make large contributions by 2030 towards global efforts to stay within the range of a below 2\u00b0C-consistent emission pathway by 2030. The full suite of existing initiatives beyond those in this analysis could further increase ambition towards achieving the Paris Agreement\u2019s temperature goals.

The discrepancy can be explained by the growing relative contribution of industrial, area, and off-road mobile sources of emissions, decreasing relative contribution of on-road gasoline vehicles, and slower than expected decreases in on-road diesel NOx emissions, with implications for air-quality management. Ground and satellite observations show that air pollution regulations in the United States (US) have resulted in substantial reductions in emissions and corresponding improvements in air quality over the last several decades. However, large uncertainties remain in evaluating how recent regulations affect different emission sectors and pollutant trends. Here we show a significant slowdown in decreasing US emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) for 2011\u20132015 using satellite and surface measurements.

The emission reduction has mainly been achieved engineering reduction, structural reduction, and administrative reduction. In this paper, three key industries (electricity generation, steel, and cement) are selected to measure the effects of SO2 emission reductions, the synergy effects of energy saving, and CO2 emission reduction. The main results show that, during the period of the \u201811th Five-Year Plan\u2019, engineering reduction of coal-fired power plant desulfurization played the most crucial role in the emission reduction; both engineering reduction and structural reduction can achieve low-pollution emission, but the contributions are not the same due to the divergence of relevant industries. Generally speaking, structural reduction can relatively easily achieve the synergy effect of the main pollutants and GHGs; in comparison, however, engineering reduction does not easily achieve the synergy effect. During the \u201813th Five-Year Plan\u2019 period, the following plans are proposed: strengthening the front pollution control, increasing the engineering reduction, narrowing the difference between the pollution reduction engineering ability and the actual pollution reduction effect, and strengthening the supervisory and administrative effect of both the approval of the front end and the running of the middle end.

The Global Energy Interconnection (GEI) is a modern energy system aimed at meeting the global power demand in a clean and green manner. With the development of clean replacement, electricity replacement, and grid interconnection strategies, GEI contributes to the global temperature control by dramatically reducing the level of energy-related CO2 emissions. This study proposes an integrated framework for analyzing the mechanism of CO2 emission reduction via GEI implementation. The obtained results demonstrate that the total cumulative contribution of GEI to mitigating the effects of CO2 emissions (estimated by conducting a scenario analysis) corresponds to a total reduction of 3100 Gt CO2. The contributions of the clean replacement, electricity replacement, and carbon capture and storage GEI components to this process are equal to 55, 42, 5%, respectively.

Considering both the carbon emission reduction level and low\u2010carbon promotion effort depending on the market demands, this study investigates the optimal decisions and performances of CLSC under four different game structures, that is, one non\u2010cooperative structure and three cooperative structures. In the non\u2010cooperative structure, the manufacturer controls the carbon emission level, the collection level as well as the wholesale price, while the retailer controls the low\u2010carbon promotion effort and retail price. The cooperative structures consist of one\u2010way and two\u2010way cooperation. In one\u2010way cooperative structure, the manufacturer shares only a part of retailer's low\u2010carbon promotion cost. In two\u2010way cooperative structure, the retailer shares partial manufacturer's carbon emission reduction cost or collection cost based on the one\u2010way cooperative structure.

We find that, prior to 2010, 35% of South\u2010East Asian peatlands had been converted to agriculture, principally by smallholder farmers (15% of original peat extent) and industrial oil palm plantations (14%).

In Indonesia, which hosts most of the region's peatland and where concession maps are publicly available, 70% of peatland conversion to agriculture occurred outside of known concessions for industrial plantation development, with smallholders accounting for 60% and industrial oil palm accounting for 34%.

Carbon budget analysis indicates that goal will require not only that the European Union and US reduce their emissions by greater than 80% by 2050, but that China at least comes close to doing so as well, if any budget is to be left over for the rest of the world (RoW). Given that RoW emissions are, and will come from, low-income and emerging nations, China\u2019s emission reduction potential is of no small consequence. In this paper, we use the Kaya identity to back out changes in the drivers of CO2 emissions, including gross domestic product (GDP), energy intensity (E/GDP) and the carbon content of energy (C/E), the latter two calculated to be consistent with China\u2019s long-term GDP growth rate forecasts and specified 2050 CO2 emission reduction targets.

An iterative algorithm which is based on the nucleolus theory is proposed to allocate the loss and emission reduction. The proposed algorithm will provide a robust state estimation tool for distribution companies (DISCOs) in the next step of operation.

With emission permits decreased, the enterprise can have new production strategy based on its own technology. Assuming emission permits can be freely bought and sold, we show how each enterprise can determine the optimal amount of emission allowance that should be used for production, which may leave some allowance to be sold for extra profit or may require the purchase of permits from other firms. Considering the limitation on the total allowance from emission permits, we introduce the concept of satisfaction degree and use it in maximising the minimum enterprise satisfaction degree.

The global transition of aircraft to those of composite architecture is estimated to contribute 20\u201325\u00a0% of industry CO2 reduction targets. A secondary stage of the cradle-to-grave analysis expands the study from an individual aircraft to the global fleet.MethodsAn LCA was undertaken utilising SimaPro 7.2 in combination with Ecoinvent. Eco-indicator 99 (E) V2.05 Europe EI 99 E/E was the chosen method to calculate the environmental impact of the inventory data. The previously developed aviation integrated model was utilised to construct a scenario analysis of the introduction of composite aircraft against a baseline projection, through to 2050, to model CO2 emissions due to their particular relevance in the aviation sector.Results and discussionThe analysis demonstrated CFRP structure results in a reduced single score environmental impact, despite the higher environmental impact in the manufacturing phase, due to the increased fossil fuel use. Of particular importance is that CFRP scenario quickly achieved a reduction in CO2 and NOx atmospheric emissions over its lifetime, due to the reduced fuel consumption. The modelled fleet-wide CO2 reduction of 14\u201315\u00a0% is less than the quoted emission savings of an individual aircraft (20\u00a0%) because of the limited fleet penetration by 2050 and the increased demand for air travel due to lower operating costs.ConclusionsThe introduction of aircraft based on composite material architecture has significant environmental benefits over their lifetime compared to conventional aluminium-based architecture, particularly with regards to CO2 and NOx a result of reduced fuel burn. The constructed scenario analyses the interactions of technology and the markets they are applied in, expanding on the LCA, in this case, an observed fleet-wide reduction of CO2 emission of 14\u201315\u00a0% compared to an individual aircraft of 20\u00a0%.", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "febddcc362ff44aea57333b38d5ade7a1e1f90a1", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2056880344", "DOI": "10.11113/JT.V70.3481", "CorpusId": 54610979}, "title": "Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Measures in Transportation Sector of Malaysia", "abstract": "Malaysia has committed to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 40% by the year 2020.

The objective of the scheduling is to maximize the generation profits, which are determined by the electricity sales revenue, the generating cost, and the emissions penalty over the planning horizon. Using a piecewise linear function to express the variable penalty factor, the problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming model.

We study changes in NO2 column densities using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) over China from 2005 to 2015 and compare them with the bottom-up inventory to examine NO x emission trends and their driving forces. From OMI measurements we detect the peak of NO2 column densities at a national level in the year 2011, with average NO2 column densities deceasing by 32% from 2011 to 2015 and corresponding to a simultaneous decline of 21% in bottom-up emission estimates. A significant variation in the peak year of NO2 column densities over regions is observed. Because of the reasonable agreement between the peak year of NO2 columns and the start of deployment of denitration devices, we conclude that power plants are the primary contributor to the NO2 decline, which is further supported by the emission reduction of 56% from the power sector in the bottom-up emission inventory associated with the penetration of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) increasing from 18% to 86% during 2011\u20132015. Meanwhile, regulations for vehicles also make a significant contribution to NO x emission reductions, in particular for a few urbanized regions (e.g., Beijing and Shanghai), where they implemented strict regulations for vehicle emissions years before the national schedule for SCR installations and thus reached their NO2 peak 2\u20133 years ahead of the deployment of denitration devices for power plants.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "ba6cd6d7cf01e989fb759d956443ee9774fb6a15", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1982931759", "DOI": "10.1080/03088839.2012.690081", "CorpusId": 153915190}, "title": "Effect of proposed CO2 emission reduction scenarios on capital expenditure", "abstract": "The International Maritime Organisation is currently working on establishing regulations for international shipping regarding greenhouse gas emissions, and a cost-effectiveness approach has been suggested as one method for determining the necessary reductions in emissions from shipping. Previous studies have investigated the CO2 emission reduction potential for the world shipping fleet up to 2030 and the associated marginal abatement cost levels. To analyse the cost implications of different emission reduction scenarios, this study has calculated the emission reduction potential and additional capital expenditure for 25 CO2 emission reduction measures applied to 59 ship segments. The expected fleet development over time, keeping track of new ships built from 2010 to 2030 and Existing ships built prior to 2010 and still in operation by 2030, have been modelled. Two alternative approaches to find the cost-effective potential in the world shipping fleet have been applied. One approach is to implement only measures which in themselves are cost-effective (measure-by-measure), and another approach is to implement measures as long as the net savings from cost-effective measures balance the costs of non-cost-effective measures (set of measures). The results demonstrate that by 2030, the majority (93%) of the reduction potential will be related to new ships. Our results show that the measure-by-measure approach would decrease the CO2 emissions by 30% for new ships while the set-of-measures approach with 53% (of the 2030 baseline emissions of 1316\u2009Mt). The implication of achieving such emission reduction is an increase in the capital expenditure on New ships by 6% (USD 183 billion) and 27% (USD 761 billion), respectively, in the period 2010 to 2030 compared to a business-as-usual scenario. The measure-by-measure approach yields a 5% decrease in CO2 emission per 1% increase in capital expenditure, while the set-of-measures approach yields a 2% decrease per 1% increase. This is due to the significant variation in capital intensity of the different measures, ranging from almost zero to USD 200 per tonne of CO2 averted. The results of this study are useful for the shipping industry to assess the economic burden that must be shouldered in order to implement abatement measures under different CO2 emission reduction scenarios.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "8d57af4ec28a7028a76118a375706e3ea14a84ed", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1990099206", "DOI": "10.1021/es204293x", "CorpusId": 33642737, "PubMed": "22192240"}, "title": "Achieving national emission reduction target--China's new challenge and opportunity.", "abstract": "I order to realize sustainable economic development, the Chinese government developed a national emission reduction policy within its 11th five-year plan (2006\u22122010), targeting energy consumption reduction per unit GDP by 20% and main pollutants reduction (COD and SO2) per unit GDP by 10%. The National Development and Reform Commission monitors progress at the midyear and evaluates results at year\u2019s end. A local official failing to meet the targets for three consecutive years will be ineligible for promotion during the next five years. Thus, strong political incentives exist for local officials to execute national environmental policy within their jurisdictions. Such a policy was successfully implemented during 2006\u22122010, with a result of significant COD (from 25.49 to 22.95 million tons) and SO2 (from 14.14 to 12.73 million tons) reduction. Given these previous successes, the national government sought to continue the pollutant emissions reduction policy in its 12th five-year plan (2011\u22122015) and added two new indicators, ammonium nitrogen and nitrogen oxide pollutants. It also stipulates that the total emission of heavy metals, total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) will be controlled in sensitive watersheds, coastal areas, and regions, although without a detailed quantitative target. However, on October 11, 2011 the Ministry of Environmental Protection announced that the newly released national emissions reduction targets were not completely achieved, whereas some emissions reduction targets were not met, some actually increased. Nitrogen oxide emissions increased by 6.17%. The reasons are multiple and complicated. First, the 11th five-year emission reduction target was achieved mainly through an engineering approach, namely, establishing wastewater treatment plants and desulfurization facilities in coal-burning power plants. This approach was effective, and relatively efficient, during 2006\u22122010 because of China\u2019s immature environmental control infrastructure, but provided smaller potential for further reduction through engineering efforts. Second, the emission reduction policies expanded from manufacturing, services and residential sectors to include agricultural (ammonium nitrogen) and transportation sectors (nitrogen oxide), requiring new knowledge development and investigation to identify effective techniques. However, to meet the soaring demand on food production, fertilizer use has continuously increased. Also, to support rapid domestic auto industry development, the national government has continued a policy to encourage consumer motor vehicle purchase. In addition, nitrogen oxide is also generated from coal-burning power plants and cement factories. These two sectors have seen unprecedented growth due to increasing energy demand. Third, China faces imbalanced development across different regions. While it is easier for more prosperous eastern China regions to achieve these targets, the much less prosperous western China regions are still struggling to achieve basic economic development goals. The national government recognized such a fact and has implemented different provincial targets. This form of target setting, although socially understandable from an economic development perspective, is not scientifically rational from an environmental perspective. Finally, current quantitative targets are relative and not absolute indicators. Relative, ratio-based, indicators provide only a partial picture of environmental performance. Absolute indicators need to be included to show a more complete impact of activities and outcomes because a relative reduction in emissions does not necessarily mean a net absolute reduction in environmentally detrimental emissions. Relative environmental emissions improvement may still occur even when a net emission increase occurs if a region\u2019s annual economic growth rate is significant, especially in China. In order to overcome these challenges an integrated approach should be adopted. First, the focus should move to production efficiency and industrial structural change, such as circular economy policy (the realization of a closed loop of materials flow", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "d0dfbbc947d263c945a087e83b47b3c99b90416d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "3035769787", "PubMedCentral": "7402623", "DOI": "10.1126/science.abb7431", "CorpusId": 219903551, "PubMed": "32554754"}, "title": "Unexpected air pollution with marked emission reductions during the COVID-19 outbreak in China", "abstract": "Air pollution epidemic The lockdown enforced in most cities in China in response to the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) resulted in the virtual absence of motor vehicle traffic and sharply reduced manufacturing activity for several weeks.

Our synergistic observation analyses and model simulations show that anomalously high humidity promoted aerosol heterogeneous chemistry, along with stagnant airflow and uninterrupted emissions from power plants and petrochemical facilities, contributing to severe haze formation.

National statistics were used to estimate current annual production from agricultural and forest production systems. Crop residues were estimated from grain production and harvest index. Wood production statistics and spatial modelling of forest growth were used to estimate quantities of pulpwood, in\u2010forest residues, and wood processing residues. Possible new production systems for oil from algae and the oil\u2010seed tree Pongamia pinnata, and of lignocellulosic biomass production from short\u2010rotation coppiced eucalypt crops were also examined. The following constraints were applied to biomass production and use: avoiding clearing of native vegetation; minimizing impacts on domestic food security; retaining a portion of agricultural and forest residues to protect soil; and minimizing the impact on local processing industries by diverting only the export fraction of grains or pulpwood to bioenergy. We estimated that it would be physically possible to produce 9.6 GL yr\u22121 of first generation ethanol from current production systems, replacing 6.5 GL yr\u22121 of gasoline or 34% of current gasoline usage. Current production systems for waste oil, tallow and canola seed could produce 0.9 GL yr\u22121 of biodiesel, or 4% of current diesel usage. Cellulosic biomass from current agricultural and forestry production systems (including biomass from hardwood plantations maturing by 2030) could produce 9.5 GL yr\u22121 of ethanol, replacing 6.4 GL yr\u22121 of gasoline, or ca. 34% of current consumption. The same lignocellulosic sources could instead provide 35 TWh yr\u22121, or ca. 15% of current electricity production. New production systems using algae and P. pinnata could produce ca. 3.96 and 0.9 GL biodiesel yr\u22121, respectively. In combination, they could replace 4.2 GL yr\u22121 of fossil diesel, or 23% of current usage. Short\u2010rotation coppiced eucalypt crops could provide 4.3 GL yr\u22121 of ethanol (2.9 GL yr\u22121 replacement, or 15% of current gasoline use) or 20.2 TWh yr\u22121 of electricity (9% of current generation). In total, first and second generation fuels from current and new production systems could mitigate 26 Mt CO2\u2010e, which is 38% of road transport emissions and 5% of the national emissions. Second generation fuels from current and new production systems could mitigate 13 Mt CO2\u2010e, which is 19% of road transport emissions and 2.4% of the national emissions lignocellulose from current and new production systems could mitigate 48 Mt CO2\u2010e, which is 28% of electricity emissions and 9% of the national emissions. There are challenging sustainability issues to consider in the production of large amounts of feedstock for bioenergy in Australia. Bioenergy production can have either positive or negative impacts. Although only the export fraction of grains and sugar was used to estimate first generation biofuels so that domestic food security was not affected, it would have an impact on food supply elsewhere. Environmental impacts on soil, water and biodiversity can be significant because of the large land base involved, and the likely use of intensive harvest regimes. These require careful management. Social impacts could be significant if there were to be large\u2010scale change in land use or management. In addition, although the economic considerations of feedstock production were not covered in this article, they will be the ultimate drivers of industry development.

AN EMPIRICAL EXAMINATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMISSION REDUCTION AND FIRM PERFORMANCE", "abstract": "Evidence can be marshalled to support either the view that pollution abatement is a cost burden on firms and is detrimental to competitiveness, or that reducing emissions increases efficiency and saves money, giving firms a cost advantage. In an effort to resolve this seeming paradox, the relationship between emissions reduction and firm performance is examined empirically for a sample of S&P 500 firms using data drawn from the Investor Responsibility Research Center's Corporate Environmental Profile and Compustat. The results indicate that efforts to prevent pollution and reduce emissions drop to the \u2018bottom line\u2019 within one to two years of initiation and that those firms with the highest emission levels stand the most to gain.", "year": 1996}]}
