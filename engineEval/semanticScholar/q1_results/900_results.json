Emissions of NOx on weekends are approximately 30% lower than on weekdays due to a large drop in heavy-duty diesel truck activity, and emissions of VOC are only slightly lower on weekends. In rural areas, passenger car traffic and the associated emissions are highest on Fridays and Sundays. The combination of VOC sensitivity and reduced emissions of NOx on weekends results in higher ozone concentrations on weekends. Changes in the timing of emissions also contribute to the weekend ozone effect, but sensitivity tests show that changes in emissions timing have a minor effect compared to changes in total mass of emissions on weekends.

To help inform international negotiations of measures to achieve these goals we develop a technique for endogenously estimating the allowance allocations and associated financial transfers necessary to achieve predetermined distributional outcomes and apply it in the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. Possible burden sharing agreements are represented by different allowance allocations (and resulting financial flows) in a global cap-and-trade system. Cases studied include agreements that allocate the burden based on simple allocation rules found in current national proposals and alternatives that specify national equity goals for both developing and developed countries. The analysis shows the ambitious nature of this reduction goal: universal participation will be necessary and the welfare costs can be both substantial and wildly different across regions depending on the allocation method chosen. The choice of allocation rule is shown to affect the magnitude of the task and required emissions price because of income effects. If developing countries are fully compensated for the costs of mitigation then the welfare costs to developed countries, if shared equally, are around 2% in 2020, rising to some 10% in 2050, and the implied financial transfers are large\u2014over $400 billion per year in 2020 and rising to around $3 trillion in 2050.

Five effects of EGR were identified and investigated experimentally: the reduction in oxygen supply to the engine, participation in the combustion process of carbon dioxide and water vapour present in the EGR, increase in the specific heat capacity of the engine inlet charge, increased inlet charge temperature and reduction in the inlet charge mass flowrate arising from the use of hot EGR. The experimental methodology developed allowed each one of these effects to be investigated and quantified separately. The investigation was carried out on a high-speed, direct injection diesel engine, running at an intermediate speed and load. A limited number of tests were also conducted in an optically accessible diesel engine, which established the effects of EGR on local flame temperature. Finally, tests were conducted with simulated EGR being used additionally to the engine air supply. This contrasts with the conventional use of EGR, whereby EGR replaces some of the air supplied to the engine. It was found that the first effect of EGR (reduction in the oxygen flowrate to the engine) was substantial and resulted in very large reductions in exhaust NOx at the expense of higher particulate emissions. The second and third effects (participation of carbon dioxide and water vapour in the combustion process and increase in the charge specific heat capacity) were almost insignificant. The fourth effect (higher inlet charge temperature) increased both exhaust NOx and particulate emissions. The fifth effect (reduction in the inlet charge due to thermal throttling) reduced NOx but raised particulate emission. Finally, when EGR was used additionally to the inlet air charge (rather than displacing air), substantial reductions in NOx were recorded with little increase in particulate emission.", "year": 2000}, {"paperId": "dbd12f45dfa38c00ce58250b6709c39425819b70", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1988566791", "DOI": "10.3141/1815-02", "CorpusId": 109204605}, "title": "Energy Efficiency Strategies for Freight Trucking: Potential Impact on Fuel Use and Greenhouse Gas Emissions", "abstract": "Trucking is the dominant mode of domestic freight and offers a substantial opportunity to improve transportation energy efficiency and reduce the emission of criteria pollutants and greenhouse gases (GHGs).

Conversion of cultivated land to permanent grassland would result in the greatest reduction in N2O emissions, particularly in eastern Canada wherethe model estimated about 60% less N2O emissions for thisconversion. About 33% less N2O emissions were predicted for a changefrom conventional tillage to no-tillage in western Canada, however, a slight increase in N2O emissions was predicted for eastern Canada. GreaterN2O emissions in eastern Canada associated with the adoption of no-tillage were attributed to higher soil moisture causing denitrification, whereas the lower emissions in western Canada were attributed to less decomposition of soil organic matter in no-till versus conventional tilled soil. Elimination of summer fallow in a crop rotation resulted in a 9% decrease in N2O emissions, with substantial emissions occurringduring the wetter fallow years when N had accumulated. Increasing N-fertilizer application rates by 50% increased average emissions by 32%,while a 50% decrease of N-fertilizer application decreased emissions by16%. In general, a small increase in N2O emissions was predicted when N-fertilizer was applied in the fall rather than in the spring. Previous research on CO2 emissions with the CENTURY model (Smith et al.,2001) allowed the quantification of the combined change in N2O andCO2 emissions in CO2 equivalents for a wide range of managementpractices in the seven major soil regions in Canada. The management practices that have the greatest potential to reduce the combined N2O andCO2 emissions are conversion from conventional tillage to permanent grassland, reduced tillage, and reduction of summer fallow. The estimated net greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction when changing from cultivated land to permanent grassland ranged from 0.97 (Brown Chernozem) to 4.24 MgCO2 equiv. ha\u22121 y\u22121 (BlackChernozem) for the seven soil regions examined.

This paper reviews different weight factors that have been used in the climate economics literature. Based on a simple model, it is shown that although the different weight factors imply substantially different cost-damage estimates, they actually yield the same optimal emission reductions. This paradox is explained by the fact that some of the approaches require that also the abatement costs are weighted \u2013 and this offsets the effect of the diverging cost-damage estimates. The model is then used to analyse the importance weighting may have on the overall cost-benefit analysis. At present, when most of the global emissions of (fossil) CO2 originate from the industrialised countries, the global optimal emissions are considerably lower if costs are weighted. However, the more the emissions in developing countries grow, the less important becomes the introduction of weight factors in cost-benefit analysis of climate change for the global emission reductions, in the model developed here. On a regional level, the introduction of weight factors continues to play an important role, implying substantially lower emissions in the rich region and slightly higher (!) in the poor.", "year": 1999}, {"paperId": "c8c519a2fd7e097369d9aafdeaee0b45ddee7957", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1597546617", "DOI": "10.4271/2004-01-2924", "CorpusId": 109044096}, "title": "Operational and Environmental Evaluation of Diesel Engines Burning Oxygen-Enriched Intake Air or Oxygen-Enriched Fuels: A Review", "abstract": "A method to curtail emissions of smoke and other pollutants from diesel engines is to enhance the oxygen supply to their combustion chamber. This can be accomplished by enriching either the intake air stream or the fuel stream with oxygen. Experimental studies concerning the oxygen-enrichment of intake air, have revealed large decrease of ignition delay, drastic decrease of soot emissions as well as reduction of CO and HC emissions while, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) remained unaffected and increasing of power output is feasible. However, this technique was accompanied by considerable increase of NO x emissions. Experimental and theoretical studies with oxygenated fuels have demonstrated large decrease of soot emissions, which correlated well with the fuel oxygen content. Reduction of CO and HC emissions with oxygenated fuels was also obtained. However, penalties in both BSFC and NO x emissions have been observed with oxygenation of diesel fuels. In both cases one has to weigh the tradeoffs in fuel economy, in power output and in the emissions of various pollutants. Moreover, fuel cost, availability and supply infrastructure, as well as equipment and operational costs, are among concerns that apply to these techniques. This manuscript presents a comparative evaluation of the two techniques regarding engine performance characteristics, environmental repercussions and economy of operation. The primary objective is to contrast the benefits and the drawbacks of the two techniques in view of economic, operational and environmental parameters. Results have shown that the overall economy of operation of the two techniques may be comparable, if the price of oxygenated fuel blends is similar to that of diesel fuel. Their impact on pollutant emissions may also be comparable, if the oxygen enrichment of either technique is limited to a low level (<23% by mass in the cylinder mixture). However, there are possibilities of increasing the power density of engines with oxygen enrichment of the intake air.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "eee4e5142da10b6edca92e255cf4c8197c7fb6da", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1851756145", "DOI": "10.1596/1813-9450-2357", "CorpusId": 17355680}, "title": "Evaluating Carbon Offsets from Forestry and Energy Projects: How Do They Compare?", "abstract": "Under the Clean Development Mechanism, developing countries will be able to produce certified emissions reductions (CERs, sometimes called offsets) through projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions below business-as-usual levels. The challenges of setting up offset markets are considerable. Do forestry projects, as a class, have more difficulty than energy projects reducing greenhouse gas emissions in ways that are real, measurable, additional, and consistent with sustainable development? Under the Kyoto Protocol, industrial countries accept caps on their emissions of greenhouse gases. They are permitted to acquire offsetting emissions reductions from developing countries - which do not have emissions limitations - to assist in complying with these caps. Because these emissions reductions are defined against a hypothetical baseline, practical issues arise in ensuring that the reductions are genuine. Forestry-related emissions reduction projects are often thought to present greater difficulties in measurement and implementation than energy-related emissions reduction projects. Chomitz discusses how project characteristics affect the process for determining compliance with each of the criteria for qualifying. Those criteria are: - Additionality. Would the emissions reductions not have taken place without the project? - Baseline and systems boundaries (leakage). What would business-as-usual emissions have been without the project? And in this comparison, how broad should spatial and temporal system boundaries be? - Measurement (or sequestration). How accurately can we measure actual with-project emissions levels? - Duration or permanence. Will the project have an enduring mitigating effect? - Local impact. Will the project benefit its neighbors? For all the criteria except permanence, it is difficult to find generic distinctions between land use change and forestry and energy projects, since both categories comprise diverse project types. The important distinctions among projects have to do with such things as: - The level and distribution of the project's direct financial benefits. - How much the project is integrated with the larger system. - The project components' internal homogeneity and geographic dispersion. - The local replicability of project technologies. Permanence is an issue specific to land use change and forestry projects. Chomitz describes various approaches to ensure permanence or adjust credits for duration: the ton-year approach (focusing on the benefits from deferring climatic damage, and rewarding longer deferral); the combination approach (bundling current land use change and forestry emissions reductions with future reductions in the buyer's allowed amount); a technology-acceleration approach; and an insurance approach.

In particular, the effects of carbon dioxide (CO2), a principal constituent of EGR, on combustion and emissions were analysed and quantified experimentally. The use of CO2 to displace oxygen (O2) in the inlet air resulted in: reduction in the O2 supplied to the engine (dilution effect), increased inlet charge thermal capacity (thermal effect), and, potentially, participation of the CO2 in the combustion process (chemical effect). In a separate series of tests the temperature of the engine inlet charge was raised gradually in order to simulate the effect of mixing hot EGR with engine inlet air. Finally, tests were carried out during which the CO2 added to the engine air flow increased the charge mass flowrate to the engine, rather than displacing some of the O2 in the inlet air. It was found that when CO2 displaced O2 in the inlet charge, both the chemical and thermal effects on exhaust emissions were small. However, the dilution effect was substantial, and resulted in very large reductions in exhaust oxides of nitrogen (NO x ) at the expense of higher particulate and unburned hydrocarbon (uHC) emissions. Higher inlet charge temperature increased exhaust NO x and particulate emissions, but reduced uHC emissions. Finally, when CO2 was additional to the inlet air charge (rather than displacing O2), large reductions in NOx were recorded with little increase in particulate emissions.", "year": 1998}, {"paperId": "5c63edbc79f432c7f11184d5fec2110878edea02", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2043402897", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-005-5382-9", "CorpusId": 28848033}, "title": "Differentiating Future Commitments on the Basis of Countries\u2019 Relative Historical Responsibility for Climate Change: Uncertainties in the \u2018Brazilian Proposal\u2019 in the Context of a Policy Implementation", "abstract": "During the negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol, Brazil proposed allocating the greenhouse gas emission reductions of Annex I Parties according to the relative effect of a country\u2019s historical emissions on global temperature increase.

Simulations with various anthropogenic emission reductions over a 4-day high-pressure period, for which the eastern U.S. experienced elevated O3 levels, are compared to the results of a reference case that incorporates the most recent National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (1985) emissions inventory. Our focus is on the relative effects of anthropogenic NOx versus nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC) emission reductions on O3 concentrations within this photochemical regime. The model results are consistent with earlier studies that predict a reasonably high O3 sensitivity to NMHC emission reductions, and O3 increases for NOx emission reductions in regions of strong urban influence. However, the total area that exhibits these distinctly urban characteristics comprises less than 10% of the continental area within the model. O3 production for the majority of the eastern United States is found to be limited by NOx availability rather than NMHC. Thus the sensitivity to NOx emission reductions averaged over the continental regions of the model domain is about a factor of 3 higher than that of NMHC. Because of large uncertainties in the natural and anthropogenic NMHC emissions, additional sensitivity runs are performed with increased anthropogenic NMHC emissions and natural NMHC emissions excluded. These alterations do not effect our basic conclusions with respect to rural O3 formation but do impact urban locations. When anthropogenic NMHC emissions are increased by a factor of 4, control Of NOx emissions has nearly the same effect in both urban and rural areas.

Simultaneous reduction of NOx and PM emissions was observed under lean conditions at several low to moderate load conditions using two different approaches. The first approach utilizes a throttle to increase EGR rate beyond the maximum rate possible with sole use of the EGR valve for a particular engine condition. The second approach does not use a throttle, but rather uses a combination of EGR and manipulation of injection parameters. A significant reduction in particulate matter size and concentration was observed corresponding to the reduction in particulate mass. This PM reduction was accompanied by a significant shift in the heat release profile. In addition, there were significant cylinder-to-cylinder variations in particulate matter characteristics, gaseous emissions, and heat release. A fuel penalty is associated with operating in the low NOx and low PM regime when there are no modifications to the injection strategy. Preliminary experiments indicate that the penalty can be eliminated or reduced to a few percent while still maintaining a significant reduction in NOx and PM.

The database utilized in this study is the one presently employed under the 1979 Geneva Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution. The emission data reported to EMEP indicate that the European sulphur emissions declined by approximately 50% during the period 1980\u20131995.

A broad range in magnitude, altitude, and latitude of the assumed NOx emissions is examined. Major findings of this initial study are as follows: (1) Nitrogen oxides from the exhaust gases of stratospheric aircraft can reduce stratospheric ozone on a global basis. These calculated ozone reductions depend strongly on NOx injection altitude and magnitude. (2) The altitude at which NOx emissions cause the largest reduction in the ozone column is about 25 km according to one-dimensional model calculations and about 28 km according to the two-dimensional model. (3) For a given altitude and magnitude Of NOx emissions, the two-dimensional model finds that the reduction of global ozone depends on latitude of the injections, with maximum ozone reduction for tropical injection. For a given injection, the largest ozone column reductions occur in the polar regions. (4) For very large Clx mixing ratios, NOx emissions can increase the ozone column, partially counteracting the ozone reduction caused by Clx. This effect is found only in a highly Clx perturbed stratosphere where ozone is already greatly depleted. (5) Water vapor (without nitric oxide) in the exhaust gives a small ozone reduction; water vapor and nitric oxide together give an ozone reduction less than that calculated for NO alone by factors between 0.85 and 0.97.

GDP growth coinciding with absolute reductions in emissions or resource use is denoted as \"absolute decoupling\", as opposed to \"relative decoupling\", where resource use or emissions increase less so than does GDP. Based on the bibliometric mapping in part I (Wiedenhofer et al., this issue), we synthesize the evidence emerging from the selected 835 peer-reviewed articles. We evaluate empirical studies of decoupling related to final/useful energy, exergy, use of material resources, as well as CO2 and total GHG emissions. We find that relative decoupling is frequent for material use as well as GHG and CO2 emissions but not for useful exergy, a quality-based measure of energy use. Primary energy can be decoupled from GDP largely to the extent to which the conversion of primary energy to useful exergy is improved. Examples of absolute long-term decoupling are rare, but recently some industrialized countries have decoupled GDP from both production- and, weaklier, consumption-based CO2 emissions. We analyze policies or strategies in the decoupling literature by classifying them into three groups: (1) Green growth, if sufficient reductions of resource use or emissions were deemed possible without altering the growth trajectory. (2) Degrowth, if reductions of resource use or emissions were given priority over GDP growth. (3) Others, e.g. if the role of energy for GDP growth was analyzed without reference to climate change mitigation. We conclude that large rapid absolute reductions of resource use and GHG emissions cannot be achieved through observed decoupling rates, hence decoupling needs to be complemented by sufficiency-oriented strategies and strict enforcement of absolute reduction targets.

Most of these emissions arise from energy use. Davis et al. review what it would take to achieve decarbonization of the energy system. Some parts of the energy system are particularly difficult to decarbonize, including aviation, long-distance transport, steel and cement production, and provision of a reliable electricity supply. Current technologies and pathways show promise, but integration of now-discrete energy sectors and industrial processes is vital to achieve minimal emissions. Science, this issue p. eaas9793 BACKGROUND Net emissions of CO2 by human activities\u2014including not only energy services and industrial production but also land use and agriculture\u2014must approach zero in order to stabilize global mean temperature. Energy services such as light-duty transportation, heating, cooling, and lighting may be relatively straightforward to decarbonize by electrifying and generating electricity from variable renewable energy sources (such as wind and solar) and dispatchable (\u201con-demand\u201d) nonrenewable sources (including nuclear energy and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage). However, other energy services essential to modern civilization entail emissions that are likely to be more difficult to fully eliminate. These difficult-to-decarbonize energy services include aviation, long-distance transport, and shipping; production of carbon-intensive structural materials such as steel and cement; and provision of a reliable electricity supply that meets varying demand. Moreover, demand for such services and products is projected to increase substantially over this century. The long-lived infrastructure built today, for better or worse, will shape the future. Here, we review the special challenges associated with an energy system that does not add any CO2 to the atmosphere (a net-zero emissions energy system). We discuss prominent technological opportunities and barriers for eliminating and/or managing emissions related to the difficult-to-decarbonize services; pitfalls in which near-term actions may make it more difficult or costly to achieve the net-zero emissions goal; and critical areas for research, development, demonstration, and deployment. It may take decades to research, develop, and deploy these new technologies. ADVANCES A successful transition to a future net-zero emissions energy system is likely to depend on vast amounts of inexpensive, emissions-free electricity; mechanisms to quickly and cheaply balance large and uncertain time-varying differences between demand and electricity generation; electrified substitutes for most fuel-using devices; alternative materials and manufacturing processes for structural materials; and carbon-neutral fuels for the parts of the economy that are not easily electrified. Recycling and removal of carbon from the atmosphere (carbon management) is also likely to be an important activity of any net-zero emissions energy system. The specific technologies that will be favored in future marketplaces are largely uncertain, but only a finite number of technology choices exist today for each functional role. To take appropriate actions in the near term, it is imperative to clearly identify desired end points. To achieve a robust, reliable, and affordable net-zero emissions energy system later this century, efforts to research, develop, demonstrate, and deploy those candidate technologies must start now. OUTLOOK Combinations of known technologies could eliminate emissions related to all essential energy services and processes, but substantial increases in costs are an immediate barrier to avoiding emissions in each category. In some cases, innovation and deployment can be expected to reduce costs and create new options. More rapid changes may depend on coordinating operations across energy and industry sectors, which could help boost utilization rates of capital-intensive assets, but this will require overcoming institutional and organizational challenges in order to create new markets and ensure cooperation among regulators and disparate, risk-averse businesses. Two parallel and broad streams of research and development could prove useful: research in technologies and approaches that can decarbonize provision of the most difficult-to-decarbonize energy services, and research in systems integration that would allow reliable and cost-effective provision of these services. A shower of molten metal in a steel foundry. Industrial processes such as steelmaking will be particularly challenging to decarbonize. Meeting future demand for such difficult-to-decarbonize energy services and industrial products without adding CO2 to the atmosphere may depend on technological cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries. Some energy services and industrial processes\u2014such as long-distance freight transport, air travel, highly reliable electricity, and steel and cement manufacturing\u2014are particularly difficult to provide without adding carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. Rapidly growing demand for these services, combined with long lead times for technology development and long lifetimes of energy infrastructure, make decarbonization of these services both essential and urgent. We examine barriers and opportunities associated with these difficult-to-decarbonize services and processes, including possible technological solutions and research and development priorities. A range of existing technologies could meet future demands for these services and processes without net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, but their use may depend on a combination of cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries.", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "6e59f86842872926b0eb1180df4aaff930653a2d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2328487243", "DOI": "10.1038/nature17174", "CorpusId": 205248025, "PubMed": "27078564"}, "title": "Climate-smart soils", "abstract": "Soils are integral to the function of all terrestrial ecosystems and to food and fibre production.

The periodic cycle of PM events in Beijing is regulated by meteorological conditions. While the particle chemical compositions in Beijing are similar to those commonly measured worldwide, efficient nucleation and growth over an extended period in Beijing are distinctive from the aerosol formation typically observed in other global areas. Gaseous emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides from urban transportation and sulfur dioxide from regional industry are responsible for large secondary PM formation, while primary emissions and regional transport of PM are insignificant. Reductions in emissions of the aerosol precursor gases from transportation and industry are essential to mediate severe haze pollution in China. As the world\u2019s second largest economy, China has experienced severe haze pollution, with fine particulate matter (PM) recently reaching unprecedentedly high levels across many cities, and an understanding of the PM formation mechanism is critical in the development of efficient mediation policies to minimize its regional to global impacts. We demonstrate a periodic cycle of PM episodes in Beijing that is governed by meteorological conditions and characterized by two distinct aerosol formation processes of nucleation and growth, but with a small contribution from primary emissions and regional transport of particles. Nucleation consistently precedes a polluted period, producing a high number concentration of nano-sized particles under clean conditions. Accumulation of the particle mass concentration exceeding several hundred micrograms per cubic meter is accompanied by a continuous size growth from the nucleation-mode particles over multiple days to yield numerous larger particles, distinctive from the aerosol formation typically observed in other regions worldwide. The particle compositions in Beijing, on the other hand, exhibit a similarity to those commonly measured in many global areas, consistent with the chemical constituents dominated by secondary aerosol formation.

Such a transformation will require technologies that are not yet commercialized and intensive public-private and interindustry coordination at every stage of the process. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050 requires widespread electrification of transportation and other sectors.

The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) onboard NASA's Aura satellite has been providing global observations of the ozone layer and key atmospheric pollutant gases, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2), since October 2004. The data products from the same instrument provide consistent spatial and temporal coverage and permit the study of anthropogenic and natural emissions on local-to-global scales. In this paper, we examine changes in SO2 and NO2 over some of the world's most polluted industrialized regions during the first decade of OMI observations. In terms of regional pollution changes, we see both upward and downward trends, sometimes in opposite directions for NO2 and SO2, for different study areas. The trends are, for the most part, associated with economic and/or technological changes in energy use, as well as regional regulatory policies. Over the eastern US, both NO2 and SO2 levels decreased dramatically from 2005 to 2015, by more than 40 and 80\u202f%, respectively, as a result of both technological improvements and stricter regulations of emissions. OMI confirmed large reductions in SO2 over eastern Europe's largest coal-fired power plants after installation of flue gas desulfurization devices. The North China Plain has the world's most severe SO2 pollution, but a decreasing trend has been observed since 2011, with about a 50\u202f% reduction in 2012\u20132015, due to an economic slowdown and government efforts to restrain emissions from the power and industrial sectors. In contrast, India's SO2 and NO2 levels from coal power plants and smelters are growing at a fast pace, increasing by more than 100 and 50\u202f%, respectively, from 2005 to 2015. Several SO2 hot spots observed over the Persian Gulf are probably related to oil and gas operations and indicate a possible underestimation of emissions from these sources in bottom-up emission inventories.

The objectives of this review are to evaluate options that have been demonstrated to mitigate enteric CH4 emissions per unit of ECM (CH4/ECM) from dairy cattle on a quantitative basis and in a sustained manner and to integrate approaches in genetics, feeding and nutrition, physiology, and health to emphasize why herd productivity, not individual animal productivity, is important to environmental sustainability. A nutrition model based on carbohydrate digestion was used to evaluate the effect of feeding and nutrition strategies on CH4/ECM, and a meta-analysis was conducted to quantify the effects of lipid supplementation on CH4/ECM. A second model combining herd structure dynamics and production level was used to estimate the effect of genetic and management strategies that increase milk yield and reduce culling on CH4/ECM. Some of these approaches discussed require further research, but many could be implemented now. Past efforts in CH4 mitigation have largely focused on identifying and evaluating CH4 mitigation approaches based on nutrition, feeding, and modifications of rumen function. Nutrition and feeding approaches may be able to reduce CH4/ECM by 2.5 to 15%, whereas rumen modifiers have had very little success in terms of sustained CH4 reductions without compromising milk production. More significant reductions of 15 to 30% CH4/ECM can be achieved by combinations of genetic and management approaches, including improvements in heat abatement, disease and fertility management, performance-enhancing technologies, and facility design to increase feed efficiency and life-time productivity of individual animals and herds.

Conversion of biomass C to bio-char C leads to sequestration of about 50% of the initial C compared to the low amounts retained after burning (3%) and biological decomposition (< 10\u201320% after 5\u201310 years), therefore yielding more stable soil C than burning or direct land application of biomass. This efficiency of C conversion of biomass to bio-char is highly dependent on the type of feedstock, but is not significantly affected by the pyrolysis temperature (within 350\u2013500 \u2218C common for pyrolysis). Existing slash-and-burn systems cause significant degradation of soil and release of greenhouse gases and opportunies may exist to enhance this system by conversion to slash-and-char systems. Our global analysis revealed that up to 12% of the total anthropogenic C emissions by land use change (0.21 Pg C) can be off-set annually in soil, if slash-and-burn is replaced by slash-and-char. Agricultural and forestry wastes such as forest residues, mill residues, field crop residues, or urban wastes add a conservatively estimated 0.16 Pg C yr\u22121. Biofuel production using modern biomass can produce a bio-char by-product through pyrolysis which results in 30.6 kg C sequestration for each GJ of energy produced. Using published projections of the use of renewable fuels in the year 2100, bio-char sequestration could amount to 5.5\u20139.5 Pg C yr\u22121 if this demand for energy was met through pyrolysis, which would exceed current emissions from fossil fuels (5.4 Pg C yr\u22121).

Land-use modification strategies reduce the cost of limiting atmospheric CO2 concentrations, but can make crop prices rise and transform human diets, for example, when people consume less beef and other carbon-intensive protein sources. The rate at which crop productivity is improved has a strong influence on emissions from land-use change. Thus, the technology used for growing crops is potentially as important for limiting atmospheric CO2 as are approaches like CO2 capture and storage. Technologies for growing crops are potentially as important for limiting the concentration of atmospheric CO2 as are those for capture and storage. Limiting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations to low levels requires strategies to manage anthropogenic carbon emissions from terrestrial systems as well as fossil fuel and industrial sources. We explore the implications of fully integrating terrestrial systems and the energy system into a comprehensive mitigation regime that limits atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that this comprehensive approach lowers the cost of meeting environmental goals but also carries with it profound implications for agriculture: Unmanaged ecosystems and forests expand, and food crop and livestock prices rise.

At the same time, livestock is an invaluable source of nutrition and livelihood for millions of poor people. Therefore, climate mitigation policies involving livestock must be designed with extreme care. Here we demonstrate the large mitigation potential inherent in the heterogeneity of livestock production systems. We find that even within existing systems, autonomous transitions from extensive to more productive systems would decrease GHG emissions and improve food availability. Most effective climate policies involving livestock would be those targeting emissions from land-use change. To minimize the economic and social cost, policies should target emissions at their source\u2014on the supply side\u2014rather than on the demand side. Livestock are responsible for 12% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable intensification of livestock production systems might become a key climate mitigation technology. However, livestock production systems vary substantially, making the implementation of climate mitigation policies a formidable challenge. Here, we provide results from an economic model using a detailed and high-resolution representation of livestock production systems. We project that by 2030 autonomous transitions toward more efficient systems would decrease emissions by 736 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (MtCO2e\u22c5y\u22121), mainly through avoided emissions from the conversion of 162 Mha of natural land. A moderate mitigation policy targeting emissions from both the agricultural and land-use change sectors with a carbon price of US$10 per tCO2e could lead to an abatement of 3,223 MtCO2e\u22c5y\u22121. Livestock system transitions would contribute 21% of the total abatement, intra- and interregional relocation of livestock production another 40%, and all other mechanisms would add 39%. A comparable abatement of 3,068 MtCO2e\u22c5y\u22121 could be achieved also with a policy targeting only emissions from land-use change. Stringent climate policies might lead to reductions in food availability of up to 200 kcal per capita per day globally.

We present new, city-level estimates of CO2 emissions for 182 Chinese cities, decomposed into 17 different fossil fuels, 46 socioeconomic sectors, and 7 industrial processes.

In turn, clusters of industrial cities are supported by nearby centers of coal or oil extraction. Whereas policies directly targeting manufacturing and electric power infrastructure would drastically undermine the GDP of industrial cities, consumption-based policies might allow emission reductions to be subsidized by those with greater ability to pay. In particular, sector-based analysis of each city suggests that technological improvements could be a practical and effective means of reducing emissions while maintaining growth and the current economic structure and energy system.

Emissions in China tripled from 1980 [131 terrogram (Tg) of CO2-eq (Tg CO2-eq)] to 2010 (452 Tg CO2-eq). N fertilizer-related emissions constitute about 7% of GHG emissions from the entire Chinese economy and exceed soil carbon gain resulting from N fertilizer use by several-fold. We identified potential emission reductions by comparing prevailing technologies and management practices in China with more advanced options worldwide. Mitigation opportunities include improving methane recovery during coal mining, enhancing energy efficiency in fertilizer manufacture, and minimizing N overuse in field-level crop production. We find that use of advanced technologies could cut N fertilizer-related emissions by 20\u201363%, amounting to 102\u2013357 Tg CO2-eq annually. Such reduction would decrease China\u2019s total GHG emissions by 2\u20136%, which is significant on a global scale.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "11c1d06394e1613cec7eb25c2c8fa4fa1acd6777", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2620437589", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1525736113", "CorpusId": 27631206, "PubMed": "27162336"}, "title": "Increasing importance of deposition of reduced nitrogen in the United States", "abstract": "Significance Human activities have greatly increased emissions of reactive forms of nitrogen to the atmosphere. This perturbation to the nitrogen cycle has produced large increases of nitrogen deposition to sensitive ecosystems. Over recent decades, attention has focused on wet and dry deposition of nitrate stemming from fossil fuel combustion emissions of nitrogen oxides. Successful decreases in nitrogen oxides emissions in the United States have substantially decreased nitrate deposition. By contrast, emissions of ammonia, an unregulated air pollutant, and resulting deposition of ammonium have grown. Expanded observations demonstrate that deposition of reactive nitrogen in the United States has shifted from a nitrate-dominated to an ammonium-dominated condition. Recognition of this shift is critical to formulating effective future policies to protect ecosystems from excess nitrogen deposition. Rapid development of agriculture and fossil fuel combustion greatly increased US reactive nitrogen emissions to the atmosphere in the second half of the 20th century, resulting in excess nitrogen deposition to natural ecosystems. Recent efforts to lower nitrogen oxides emissions have substantially decreased nitrate wet deposition. Levels of wet ammonium deposition, by contrast, have increased in many regions. Together these changes have altered the balance between oxidized and reduced nitrogen deposition. Across most of the United States, wet deposition has transitioned from being nitrate-dominated in the 1980s to ammonium-dominated in recent years. Ammonia has historically not been routinely measured because there are no specific regulatory requirements for its measurement. Recent expansion in ammonia observations, however, along with ongoing measurements of nitric acid and fine particle ammonium and nitrate, permit new insight into the balance of oxidized and reduced nitrogen in the total (wet + dry) US nitrogen deposition budget. Observations from 37 sites reveal that reduced nitrogen contributes, on average, \u223c65% of the total inorganic nitrogen deposition budget. Dry deposition of ammonia plays an especially key role in nitrogen deposition, contributing from 19% to 65% in different regions. Future progress toward reducing US nitrogen deposition will be increasingly difficult without a reduction in ammonia emissions.", "year": 2016}, {"paperId": "b342002440f17d2001dfa16835ec7080c1e252d3", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2123722907", "DOI": "10.1073/pnas.1200452109", "CorpusId": 3193523, "PubMed": "22523241"}, "title": "Committed carbon emissions, deforestation, and community land conversion from oil palm plantation expansion in West Kalimantan, Indonesia", "abstract": "Industrial agricultural plantations are a rapidly increasing yet largely unmeasured source of tropical land cover change.

With a spatially explicit land change/carbon bookkeeping model, parameterized using high-resolution satellite time series and informed by socioeconomic surveys, we assess previous and project future plantation expansion under five scenarios. Although fire was the primary proximate cause of 1989\u20132008 deforestation (93%) and net carbon emissions (69%), by 2007\u20132008, oil palm directly caused 27% of total and 40% of peatland deforestation.

Many air pollutant sources also emit carbon dioxide (CO2), the dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG). The two main contributors to non-attainment of U.S. ambient air quality standards, ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM), interact with radiation, forcing climate change. PM warms by absorbing sunlight (e.g., black carbon) or cools by scattering sunlight (e.g., sulfates) and interacts with clouds; these radiative and microphysical interactions can induce changes in precipitation and regional circulation patterns. Climate change is expected to degrade air quality in many polluted regions by changing air pollution meteorology (ventilation and dilution), precipitation and other removal processes, and by triggering some amplifying responses in atmospheric chemistry and in anthropogenic and natural sources. Together, these processes shape distributions and extreme episodes of O3 and PM. Global modeling indicates that as air pollution programs reduce SO2 to meet health and other air quality goals, near-term warming accelerates due to \u201cunmasking\u201d of warming induced by rising CO2. Air pollutant controls on CH4, a potent GHG and precursor to global O3 levels, and on sources with high black carbon (BC) to organic carbon (OC) ratios could offset near-term warming induced by SO2 emission reductions, while reducing global background O3 and regionally high levels of PM. Lowering peak warming requires decreasing atmospheric CO2, which for some source categories would also reduce co-emitted air pollutants or their precursors. Model projections for alternative climate and air quality scenarios indicate a wide range for U.S. surface O3 and fine PM, although regional projections may be confounded by interannual to decadal natural climate variability. Continued implementation of U.S. NOx emission controls guards against rising pollution levels triggered either by climate change or by global emission growth. Improved accuracy and trends in emission inventories are critical for accountability analyses of historical and projected air pollution and climate mitigation policies. Implications: The expansion of U.S. air pollution policy to protect climate provides an opportunity for joint mitigation, with CH4 a prime target. BC reductions in developing nations would lower the global health burden, and for BC-rich sources (e.g., diesel) may lessen warming. Controls on these emissions could offset near-term warming induced by health-motivated reductions of sulfate (cooling). Wildfires, dust, and other natural PM and O3 sources may increase with climate warming, posing challenges to implementing and attaining air quality standards.

Advances in technology and the resulting improved productivity in corn and sugarcane farming and ethanol conversion, together with biofuel policies, have contributed to the significant expansion of ethanol production in the past 20 years. These improvements have increased the energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) benefits of using bioethanol as opposed to using petroleum gasoline. This article presents results from our most recently updated simulations of energy use and GHG emissions that result from using bioethanol made from several feedstocks. The results were generated with the GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation) model. In particular, based on a consistent and systematic model platform, we estimate life-cycle energy consumption and GHG emissions from using ethanol produced from five feedstocks: corn, sugarcane, corn stover, switchgrass and miscanthus. We quantitatively address the impacts of a few critical factors that affect life-cycle GHG emissions from bioethanol. Even when the highly debated land use change GHG emissions are included, changing from corn to sugarcane and then to cellulosic biomass helps to significantly increase the reductions in energy use and GHG emissions from using bioethanol. Relative to petroleum gasoline, ethanol from corn, sugarcane, corn stover, switchgrass and miscanthus can reduce life-cycle GHG emissions by 19\u201048%, 40\u201062%, 90\u2010103%, 77\u201097% and 101\u2010115%, respectively.

The cost of carbon avoidance was shown to depend strongly on assumptions about the reference plant design, details of the CO2 capture system design, interactions with other pollution control systems, and method of CO2 storage. The CO2 avoidance cost for retrofit systems was found to be generally higher than for new plants, mainly because of the higher energy penalty resulting from less efficient heat integration as well as site-specific difficulties typically encountered in retrofit applications.

Pyrolysis with biochar applied to soils results in four coproducts: long-term carbon (C) sequestration from stable C in the biochar, renewable energy generation, biochar as a soil amendment, and biomass waste management. Life cycle assessment was used to estimate the energy and climate change impacts and the economics of biochar systems. The feedstocks analyzed represent agricultural residues (corn stover), yard waste, and switchgrass energy crops. The net energy of the system is greatest with switchgrass (4899 MJ t(-1) dry feedstock). The net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for both stover and yard waste are negative, at -864 and -885 kg CO(2) equivalent (CO(2)e) emissions reductions per tonne dry feedstock, respectively. Of these total reductions, 62-66% are realized from C sequestration in the biochar. The switchgrass biochar-pyrolysis system can be a net GHG emitter (+36 kg CO(2)e t(-1) dry feedstock), depending on the accounting method for indirect land-use change impacts. The economic viability of the pyrolysis-biochar system is largely dependent on the costs of feedstock production, pyrolysis, and the value of C offsets. Biomass sources that have a need for waste management such as yard waste have the highest potential for economic profitability (+$69 t(-1) dry feedstock when CO(2)e emission reductions are valued at $80 t(-1) CO(2)e).

The papers in this special thematic section review the performance of many of these instruments over the 2005\u20132015 period. The performance of existing carbon taxes and GHG ETSs can help policy makers make informed choices about whether to introduce these instruments and to improve their design. The purpose of carbon pricing instruments is to reduce GHG emissions cost effectively. Assessing their performance is difficult because emissions are also affected by other policies and exogenous factors such as economic conditions. Carbon taxes in Europe prior to 2008 and in British Columbia reduced emissions from business-as-usual but actual emissions continued to rise. Since 2008 emissions subject to European carbon taxes have declined, but in most countries, other mitigation policies have probably contributed more to the reductions than the carbon taxes. Emissions subject to ETSs, with the exception of four systems without emissions caps, have declined. The ETSs contributed to the emissions reductions, but their share of the overall reduction is not known. Most tax rates are low relative to levels thought to be needed to achieve climate change objectives. Few jurisdictions regularly adjust their tax rates. All ETSs have accumulated surplus allowances and implemented measures to reduce these surpluses. The largest ETSs now specify annual reductions in their emissions cap several years into the future. Emissions trading system allowance prices are generally lower than the tax rates. Key policy insights Theoretical discussions usually portray carbon taxes and GHG ETSs as alternatives. In practice, a jurisdiction often implements both instruments to address emissions by different sources. Designs of ETSs have evolved based on experience shared bilaterally and via dedicated institutions. Carbon tax designs, in contrast, have hardly evolved and there are no institutions dedicated to sharing experience.

That calculation, however, omits many of the biggest risks associated with climate change, and downplays the impact of current emissions on future generations. Our reanalysis explores the effects of uncertainty about climate sensitivity, the shape of the damage function, and the discount rate. We show that the social cost of carbon is uncertain across a broad range, and could be much higher than $21/tCO2. In our case combining high climate sensitivity, high damages, and a low discount rate, the social cost of carbon could be almost $900/tCO2 in 2010, rising to $1,500/tCO2 in 2050. The most ambitious scenarios for eliminating carbon dioxide emissions as rapidly as technologically feasible (reaching zero or negative net global emissions by the end of this century) require spending up to $150 to $500 per ton of reductions of carbon dioxide emissions by 2050. Using a reasonable set of alternative assumptions, therefore, the damages from a ton of carbon dioxide emissions in 2050 could exceed the cost of reducing emissions at the maximum technically feasible rate. Once this is the case, the exact value of the social cost of carbon loses importance: the clear policy prescription is to reduce emissions as rapidly as possible, and cost-effectiveness analysis offers better insights for climate policy than costbenefit analysis.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "01efcfd0f176c43f31cdfac45c4fa820b2c3860f", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "4518269", "MAG": "1864103938", "DOI": "10.1038/ncomms8714", "CorpusId": 1983399, "PubMed": "26197104"}, "title": "Drivers of the US CO2 emissions 1997\u20132013", "abstract": "Fossil fuel CO2 emissions in the United States decreased by \u223c11% between 2007 and 2013, from 6,023 to 5,377\u2009Mt.

However, the factors driving the decline have not been quantitatively evaluated; the role of natural gas in the decline therefore remains speculative. Here we analyse the factors affecting US emissions from 1997 to 2013. Before 2007, rising emissions were primarily driven by economic growth. After 2007, decreasing emissions were largely a result of economic recession with changes in fuel mix (for example, substitution of natural gas for coal) playing a comparatively minor role.

Rice (Oryza sativa), the staple crop for the largest number of people on earth, is grown under flooded soil conditions and uses more water and has higher greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than most crops. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that alternate wetting and drying (AWD \u2013 flooding the soil and then allowing to dry down before being reflooded) water management practices will maintain grain yields and concurrently reduce water use, greenhouse gas emissions and arsenic (As) levels in rice. Various treatments ranging in frequency and duration of AWD practices were evaluated at three locations over 2 years. Relative to the flooded control treatment and depending on the AWD treatment, yields were reduced by <1\u201313%; water\u2010use efficiency was improved by 18\u201363%, global warming potential (GWP of CH4 and N2O emissions) reduced by 45\u201390%, and grain As concentrations reduced by up to 64%. In general, as the severity of AWD increased by allowing the soil to dry out more between flood events, yields declined while the other benefits increased. The reduction in GWP was mostly attributed to a reduction in CH4 emissions as changes in N2O emissions were minimal among treatments. When AWD was practiced early in the growing season followed by flooding for remainder of season, similar yields as the flooded control were obtained but reduced water use (18%), GWP (45%) and yield\u2010scaled GWP (45%); although grain As concentrations were similar or higher.

However, 2\u2009\u00b0C trajectories not relying on negative emissions or 1.5\u2009\u00b0C trajectories require elimination of most fossil-fuel-related emissions.

The complexes have the general structure C(wedge)NPt(O(wedge)O),where C(wedge)N is a monoanionic cyclometalating ligand (e.g., 2-phenylpyridyl, 2-(2'-thienyl)pyridyl, 2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridyl, etc.) and O(wedge)O is a beta-diketonato ligand. Reaction of K(2)PtCl(4) with a HC(wedge)N ligand precursor forms the chloride-bridged dimer, C(wedge)NPt(mu-Cl)(2)PtC(wedge)N, which is cleaved with beta-diketones such as acetyl acetone (acacH) and dipivaloylmethane (dpmH) to give the corresponding monomeric C(wedge)NPt(O(wedge)O) complex. The thpyPt(dpm) (thpy = 2-(2'-thienyl)pyridyl) complex has been characterized using X-ray crystallography. The bond lengths and angles for this complex are similar to those of related cyclometalated Pt complexes. There are two independent molecular dimers in the asymmetric unit, with intermolecular spacings of 3.45 and 3.56 A, consistent with moderate pi-pi interactions and no evident Pt-Pt interactions. Most of the C(wedge)NPt(O(wedge)O) complexes display a single reversible reduction wave between -1.9 and -2.6 V (vs Cp(2)Fe/Cp(2)Fe(+)), assigned to largely C(wedge)N ligand based reduction, and an irreversible oxidation, assigned to predominantly Pt based oxidation. DFT calculations were carried out on both the ground (singlet) and excited (triplet) states of these complexes. The HOMO levels are a mixture of Pt and ligand orbitals, while the LUMO is predominantly C(wedge)N ligand based. The emission characteristics of these complexes are governed by the nature of the organometallic cyclometalating ligand allowing the emission to be tuned throughout the visible spectrum. Twenty-three different C(wedge)N ligands have been examined, which gave emission lambda(max) values ranging from 456 to 600 nm. Well-resolved vibronic fine structure is observed in all of the emission spectra (room temperature and 77 K). Strong spin-orbit coupling of the platinum atom allows for the formally forbidden mixing of the (1)MLCT with the (3)MCLT and (3)pi-pi states.

Implications of 21st century climate change on the hydrology and water resources of the Colorado River Basin were assessed using a multimodel ensemble approach in which downscaled and bias corrected output from 11 General Circulation Models (GCMs) was used to drive macroscale hydrology and water resources models. Downscaled climate scenarios (ensembles) were used as forcings to the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macroscale hydrology model, which in turn forced the Colorado River Reservoir Model (CRMM). Ensembles of downscaled precipitation and temperature, and derived streamflows and reservoir system performance were assessed through comparison with current climate simulations for the 1950\u20131999 historical period. For each of the 11 GCMs, two emissions scenarios (IPCC SRES A2 and B1, corresponding to relatively unconstrained growth in emissions, and elimination of global emissions increases by 2100) were represented. Results for the A2 and B1 climate scenarios were divided into three periods: 2010\u20132039, 2040\u20132069, and 2070\u20132099. The mean temperature change averaged over the 11 ensembles for the Colorado basin for the A2 emission scenario ranged from 1.2 to 4.4\u00b0C for periods 1\u20133, and for the B1 scenario from 1.3 to 2.7\u00b0C. Precipitation changes were modest, with ensemble mean changes ranging from \u22121 to \u22122% for the A2 scenario, and from +1 to \u22121% for the B1 scenario. An analysis of seasonal precipitation patterns showed that most GCMs had modest reductions in summer precipitation and increases in winter precipitation. Derived April 1 snow water equivalent declined for all ensemble members and time periods, with maximum (ensemble mean) reductions of 38% for the A2 scenario in period 3. Runoff changes were mostly the result of a dominance of increased evapotranspiration over the seasonal precipitation shifts, with ensemble mean runoff changes of \u22121, \u22126, and \u221211% for the A2 ensembles, and 0, \u22127, and \u22128% for the B1 ensembles. These hydrological changes were reflected in reservoir system performance. Average total basin reservoir storage and average hydropower production generally declined, however there was a large range across the ensembles. Releases from Glen Canyon Dam to the Lower Basin were reduced for all periods and both emissions scenarios in the ensemble mean.
