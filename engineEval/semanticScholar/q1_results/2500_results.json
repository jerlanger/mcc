Because emissions of NOx contribute to the high concentration of atmospheric ozone in the eastern states associated with health hazards, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called on eastern states to formulate state implementation plans (SIPs) for reducing NOx emissions. Our analysis considers three NOx reduction scenarios: a summer seasonal cap in the eastern states covered by EPA's NOx SIP Call, an annual cap in the same SIP Call region, and a national annual cap. All scenarios allow for emissions trading. Although EPA's current policy is to implement a seasonal cap in the SIP Call region, this analysis indicates that an annual cap in the SIP Call region would yield about $400 million more in net benefits (benefits less costs) than would a seasonal policy, based on particulate-related health effects only. An annual cap in the SIP Call region is also the policy that is most likely to achieve benefits in excess of costs. Consideration of omissions from this accounting, including the potential benefits from reductions in ozone concentrations, strengthens the finding that an annual program offers greater net benefits than does a seasonal program.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "c9102d1262053821a56562352735900f51417fe9", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2508888177", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-17-31-2017", "CorpusId": 56407028}, "title": "Air quality improvement in a megacity: implications from 2015 Beijing Parade Blue pollution control actions", "abstract": "Abstract. The implementation of strict emission control measures in Beijing and surrounding regions during the 2015\u00a0China Victory Day Parade provided a valuable opportunity to investigate related air quality improvements in a megacity. We measured NH3, NO2 and PM2.5 at multiple sites in and outside Beijing and summarized concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2 and CO in 291\u00a0cities across China from a national urban air quality monitoring network between August and September\u00a02015. Consistently significant reductions of 12\u201335\u202f% for NH3 and 33\u201359\u202f% for NO2 in different areas of Beijing during the emission control period (referred to as the Parade Blue period) were observed compared with measurements in the pre- and post-Parade Blue periods without emission controls. Average NH3 and NO2 concentrations at sites near traffic were strongly correlated and showed positive and significant responses to traffic reduction measures, suggesting that traffic is an important source of both NH3 and NOx in urban Beijing. Daily concentrations of PM2.5 and secondary inorganic aerosol (sulfate, ammonium and nitrate) at the urban and rural sites both decreased during the Parade Blue period. During (after) the emission control period, concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2 and CO from the national city-monitoring network showed the largest decrease (increase) of 34\u201372\u202f% (50\u2013214\u202f%) in Beijing, a smaller decrease (a moderate increase) of 1\u201332\u202f% (16\u201344\u202f%) in emission control regions outside Beijing and an increase (decrease) of 6\u201316\u202f% (\u22122\u20137\u202f%) in non-emission-control regions of China.

The complexes have the general formula Ir(C'N)(3) [where C'N is a monoanionic cyclometalating ligand; 2-phenylpyridyl (ppy), 2-(p-tolyl)pyridyl (tpy), 2-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyridyl (46dfppy), 1-phenylpyrazolyl (ppz), 1-(4,6-difluorophenyl)pyrazolyl (46dfppz), or 1-(4-trifluoromethylphenyl)pyrazolyl (tfmppz)]. Reaction of the dichloro-bridged dimers [(C'N(2)Ir(mu-Cl)(2)Ir(C'N)(2)] with 2 equiv of HC( wedge )N at 140-150 degrees C forms the corresponding meridional isomer, while higher reaction temperatures give predominantly the facial isomer. Both facial and meridional isomers can be obtained in good yield (>70%). The meridional isomer of Ir(tpy)(3) and facial and meridional isomers of Ir(ppz)(3) and Ir(tfmppz)(3) have been structurally characterized using X-ray crystallography. The facial isomers have near identical bond lengths (av Ir-C = 2.018 A, av Ir-N = 2.123 A) and angles. The three meridional isomers have the expected bond length alternations for the differing trans influences of phenyl and pyridyl/pyrazolyl ligands. Bonds that are trans to phenyl groups are longer (Ir-C av = 2.071 A, Ir-N av = 2.031 A) than when they are trans to heterocyclic groups. The Ir-C and Ir-N bonds with trans N and C, respectively, have bond lengths very similar to those observed for the corresponding facial isomers. DFT calculations of both the singlet (ground) and the triplet states of the compounds suggest that the HOMO levels are a mixture of Ir and ligand orbitals, while the LUMO is predominantly ligand-based. All of the complexes show reversible oxidation between 0.3 and 0.8 V, versus Fc/Fc(+). The meridional isomers are easier to oxidize by ca. 50-100 mV. The phenylpyridyl-based complexes have reduction potentials between -2.5 and -2.8 V, whereas the phenylpyrazolyl-based complexes exhibit no reduction up to the solvent limit of -3.0 V. All of the compounds have intense absorption bands in the UV region assigned into (1)(pi --> pi) transitions and weaker MLCT (metal-to-ligand charge transfer) transitions that extend to the visible region. The MLCT transitions of the pyrazolyl-based complexes are hypsochromically shifted relative to those of the pyridyl-based compounds. The phenylpyridyl-based Ir(III) tris-cyclometalates exhibit intense emission both at room temperature and at 77 K, whereas the phenylpyrazolyl-based derivatives emit strongly only at 77 K. The emission energies and lifetimes of the phenylpyridyl-based complexes (450-550 nm, 2-6 micros) and phenylpyrazolyl-based compounds (390-440 nm, 14-33 micros) are characteristic for a mixed ligand-centered/MLCT excited state. The meridional isomers for both pyridyl and pyrazolyl-based cyclometalates show markedly different spectroscopic properties than do the facial forms. Isolated samples of mer-Ir(C( wedge )N)(3) complexes can be thermally and photochemically converted to facial forms, indicating that the meridional isomers are kinetically favored products. The lower thermodynamic stabilities of the meridional isomers are likely related to structural features of these complexes; that is, the meridional configuration places strongly trans influencing phenyl groups opposite each other, whereas all three phenyl groups are opposite pyridyl or pyrazolyl groups in the facial complexes. The strong trans influence of the phenyl groups in the meridional isomers leads to the observation that they are easier to oxidize, exhibit broad, red-shifted emission, and have lower quantum efficiencies than their facial counterparts.", "year": 2003}, {"paperId": "5adcbdfc5480b1109826367d85abe9a6e5824d79", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2171091621", "DOI": "10.5194/ACP-12-11519-2012", "CorpusId": 54846117}, "title": "The effect of coal-fired power-plant SO 2 and NO x control technologies on aerosol nucleation in the source plumes", "abstract": "Abstract. Nucleation in coal-fired power-plant plumes can greatly contribute to particle number concentrations near source regions. The changing emissions rates of SO2 and NOx due to pollution-control technologies over recent decades may have had a significant effect on aerosol formation and growth in the plumes with ultimate implications for climate and human health. We use the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) large-eddy simulation model with the TwO-Moment Aerosol Sectional (TOMAS) microphysics algorithm to model the nucleation in plumes of coal-fired plants. We test a range of cases with varying emissions to simulate the implementation of emissions-control technologies between 1997 and 2010. We start by simulating the W. A. Parish power plant (near Houston, TX) during this time period, when NOx emissions were reduced by ~90% and SO2 emissions decreased by ~30%. Increases in plume OH (due to the reduced NOx) produced enhanced SO2 oxidation and an order-of-magnitude increase in particle nucleation in the plume despite the reduction in SO2 emissions. These results suggest that NOx emissions could strongly regulate particle nucleation and growth in power-plant plumes. Next, we test a range of cases with varying emissions to simulate the implementation of SO2 and NOx emissions-control technologies. Particle formation generally increases with SO2 emission, while NOx shows two different regimes: increasing particle formation with increasing NOx under low-NOx emissions and decreasing particle formation with increasing NOx under high-NOx emissions. Next, we compare model results with airborne measurements made in the W. A. Parish power-plant plume in 2000 and 2006, confirming the importance of NOx emissions on new particle formation and highlighting the substantial effect of background aerosol loadings on this process (the more polluted background of the 2006 case caused more than an order-of-magnitude reduction in particle formation in the plume compared to the cleaner test day in 2000). Finally, we calculate particle-formation statistics of 330 coal-fired power plants in the US in 1997 and 2010, and the model results show a median decrease of 19% in particle formation rates from 1997 to 2010 (whereas the W. A. Parish case study showed an increase). Thus, the US power plants, on average, show a different result than was found for the W. A. Parish plant specifically, and it shows that the strong NOx controls (90% reduction) implemented at the W. A. Parish plant (with relatively weak SO2 emissions reductions, 30%) are not representative of most power plants in the US during the past 15 yr. These results suggest that there may be important climate implications of power-plant controls due to changes in plume chemistry and microphysics, but the magnitude and sign of the aerosol changes depend greatly on the relative reductions in NOx and SO2 emissions in each plant. More extensive plume measurements for a range of emissions of SO2 and NOx and in varying background aerosol conditions are needed, however, to better quantify these effects.", "year": 2012}, {"paperId": "390486dc6659afa34b8d78fc27cc239a0a25ca0a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2281243777", "DOI": "10.1007/S13369-016-2060-3", "CorpusId": 102124853}, "title": "Effect of Magnetite Ferrofluid on the Performance and Emissions Characteristics of Diesel Engine Using Methyl Esters of Mustard Oil", "abstract": "This present work is intended to find out the additional information on using methyl esters of mustard oil as a substitute for diesel.

These enzymes each catalyze conversion of phenylalanine to phenethylamine and tyrosine to tyramine. Although tyrosine is the preferred substrate in vitro, phenylalanine levels in tomato fruits far exceed those of tyrosine, indicating that phenylalanine is a physiological substrate.

We find that the cumulative warming capacity of concurrent biogenic methane and nitrous oxide emissions is a factor of about two larger than the cooling effect resulting from the global land carbon dioxide uptake from 2001 to 2010. This results in a net positive cumulative impact of the three greenhouse gases on the planetary energy budget, with a best estimate (in petagrams of CO2 equivalent per year) of 3.9\u2009\u00b1\u20093.8 (top down) and 5.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.8 (bottom up) based on the GWP100 metric (global warming potential on a 100-year time horizon).

The total reduction of GHG emissions in this IS exchange, 60,522 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year, was the same in the GHG protocol, whereas GHG distribution between two companies depended on the allocation method.

Methane emissions can be considerably reduced from underground coal mining, oil production, natural gas operations, landfilling of waste, and wastewater treatment.

Intensified agricultural practices lead to a reduction in ecosystem carbon stocks, mainly due to removal of aboveground biomass as harvest and loss of carbon as CO2 through burning and/or decomposition. Evidence is emerging that agroforestry systems are promising management practices to increase aboveground and soil C stocks and reduce soil degradation, as well as to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In the humid tropics, the potential of agroforestry (tree-based) systems to sequester C in vegetation can be over 70\u00a0Mg C ha\u22121, and up to 25\u00a0Mg ha\u22121 in the top 20\u00a0cm of soil. In degraded soils of the sub-humid tropics, improved fallow agroforestry practices have been found to increase top soil C stocks up to 1.6\u00a0Mg C ha\u22121 y\u22121 above continuous maize cropping. Soil C accretion is linked to the structural development of the soil, in particular to increasing C in water stable aggregates (WSA). A review of agroforestry practices in the humid tropics showed that these systems were able to mitigate N2O and CO2 emissions from soils and increase the CH4 sink strength compared to cropping systems. The increase in N2O and CO2 emissions after addition of legume residues in improved fallow systems in the sub-humid tropics indicates the importance of using lower quality organic inputs and increasing nutrient use efficiency to derive more direct and indirect benefits from the system. In summary, these examples provide evidence of several pathways by which agroforestry systems can increase C sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "a05dee4bcd8dfaa62c7a38725cf4496860bb44cb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1917632675", "DOI": "10.3141/2379-04", "CorpusId": 48277532}, "title": "Best Practices in Urban Freight Management", "abstract": "Freight movement is essential to the function of metropolitan areas, yet generates many externalities, including congestion, air pollution, noise, and greenhouse gas emissions.

Dust affects the radiative fluxes at the surface and the top of the atmosphere and the temperature profiles at every model time step when the radiation module is processed. These changes influence the atmospheric dynamics, moisture physics, and near-surface conditions. Furthermore, dust emission is modified by changes in friction velocity and turbulent exchange coefficients; dust turbulent mixing, transport, and deposition are altered by changes in atmospheric stability, precipitation conditions, and free-atmosphere winds. A major dust outbreak with dust optical depths reaching 3.5 at 550 nm over the Mediterranean region on April 2002 is selected to assess the radiative dust effects on the atmosphere at a regional level. A strong dust negative feedback upon dust emission (35\u201345% reduction of the AOD) resulted from the smaller outgoing sensible turbulent heat flux decreasing the turbulent momentum transfer from the atmosphere and consequently dust emission. Significant improvements of the atmospheric temperature and mean sea-level pressure forecasts are obtained over dust-affected areas by considerably reducing both warm and cold temperature biases existing in the model without dust-radiation interactions.

In-use activity, fuel use, and emissions were measured for six selected motor graders using a portable emission measurement system. Each motor grader was tested with petroleum diesel and B20 biodiesel. Duty cycles were quantified in terms of the empirical cumulative distribution function of manifold absolute pressure (MAP), which is an indicator of engine load. The motor graders were operated under normal duty cycles for road maintenance and repair at various locations in Wake and Nash Counties in North Carolina. Approximately 3 hr of quality-assured, second-by-second data were obtained during each test. An empirical modal-based model of vehicle fuel use and emissions was developed, based on stratifying the data with respect to ranges of normalized MAP, to enable comparisons between duty cycles, motor graders, and fuels. Time-based emission factors were found to increase monotonically with MAP. Fuel-based emission factors were mainly sensitive to differences between idle and non-idle engine operation. Cycle average emission factors were estimated for road \u201cresurfacing\u201d, \u201croading,\u201d and \u201cshouldering\u201d activities.

Design A prospective interventional study. Setting A specialist neurocritical care unit. Patients Fourteen healthy volunteers and 33 patients within 7 days of closed head injury. Interventions All subjects underwent positron emission tomography imaging of cerebral blood flow. In patients, Paco2 was reduced from 36 \u00b1 1 to 29 \u00b1 1 torr (4.8 \u00b1 0.1 to 3.9 \u00b1 0.1 kPa) and measurements repeated. Jugular venous saturation (Sjvo2) and arteriovenous oxygen content differences (AVDO2) were monitored in 25 patients and values related to positron emission tomography variables. Measurements and Main Results The volumes of critically hypoperfused and hyperperfused brain (HypoBV and HyperBV, in milliliters) were calculated based on thresholds of 10 and 55 mL\u00b7100g\u22121\u00b7min\u22121, respectively. Whereas baseline HypoBV was significantly higher in patients (p < .05), baseline HyperBV was similar to values in healthy volunteers. Hyperventilation resulted in increases in cerebral perfusion pressure (p < .0001) and reductions in intracranial pressure (p < .001), whereas Sjvo2 (>50%) and AVDO2 (<9 mL/mL) did not exceed global ischemic thresholds. However, despite these beneficial effects, hyperventilation shifted the cerebral blood flow distribution curve toward the hypoperfused range, with a decrease in global cerebral blood flow (31 \u00b1 1 to 23 \u00b1 1 mL\u00b7100g\u22121\u00b7min\u22121;p < .0001) and an increase in HypoBV (22 [1\u2013141] to 51 [2\u2013428] mL;p < .0001). Hyperventilation-induced increases in HypoBV were apparently nonlinear, with a threshold value between 34 and 38 torr (4.5\u20135 kPa). Conclusions Hyperventilation increases the volume of severely hypoperfused tissue within the injured brain, despite improvements in cerebral perfusion pressure and intracranial pressure. Significant hyperperfusion is uncommon, even at a time when conventional clinical management includes a role for modest hyperventilation.

They are also means to break through the constraints of domestic resources and environment, and internal needs, to achieve sustainable development. Generally speaking, a country's CO2 emission peak appears after achieving urbanization and industrialization. By then, connotative economic growth will appear, GDP will grow slowly, energy consumption elasticity will decrease, and energy consumption growth will slow down \u2013 dependent mainly on new and renewable energies. Fossil fuel consumption will not increase further. When CO2 emission reaches its peak, the annual reduction rate of CO2 intensity of GDP is greater than GDP annual growth rate; and the annual reduction rate of CO2 intensity of energy use is greater than the annual growth rate of energy consumption. Therefore, three important approaches to promotion of CO2 emission peak can be concluded: maintaining reasonable control of GDP growth, strengthening energy conservation to significantly reduce the GDP energy intensity, and optimizing the energy mix to reduce the CO2 intensity of energy use. By around 2030, China will basically have completed its rapid development phase of industrialization and urbanization. Connotative economic growth will appear with the acceleration of industrial structure adjustment. The target of GDP energy intensity will still be to maintain an average annual reduction of 3% or higher. The proportion of non-fossil fuels will reach 20\u201325%, and the aim will be to maintain an average annual growth rate of 6\u20138%. The total annual energy demand growth of 1.5% will be satisfied by the newly increased supply of non-fossil fuels. The annual decline in CO2 intensity of GDP will reach 4.5% or higher, which is compatible with an average annual GDP growth rate of approximately 4.5% in order to reach CO2 emission peak. This corresponds to the level of China's potential economic growth. Achieving CO2 emission peak will not impose a rigid constraint on economic development, but rather promote economic development and accelerate the transformation of green, low-carbon development. The CO2 emission peak can be controlled with a cap of 11 billion tons, which means that CO2 emission will increase by less than 50% compared with 2010. The per capita emission peak will be controlled at a level of less than 8 tons, which is lower than the 9.5 tons in the EU and Japan and much lower than the 20 tons in the US, future economic and social development faces many uncertainties in achieving the CO2 emission peak discussed above. It depends on current and future strategies and policies, as well as the pace and strength of economic transformation, innovation, and new energy technologies. If the economic transformation pattern fails to meet expectations, the time required to reach CO2 emission peak would be delayed and the peak level would be higher than expected. Therefore, we need to coordinate thoughts and ideas and deploy these in advance; to highlight the strategic position of low-carbon development and its priorities; to enact mid- to long-term energy development strategies; and to establish and improve a system of laws, regulations, and policies as well as an implementation mechanism for green, low-carbon development.

Nutritional and microbial opportunities to reduce CH\u2084 emissions have been extensively researched, but little is known about using natural variation to breed animals with lower CH\u2084 yield. Measuring CH\u2084 emission rates directly from animals is difficult and hinders direct selection on reduced CH\u2084 emission. However, improvements can be made through selection on associated traits (e.g., residual feed intake, RFI) or through selection on CH\u2084 predicted from feed intake and diet composition. The objective was to establish phenotypic and genetic variation in predicted CH\u2084 output, and to determine the potential of genetics to reduce methane emissions in dairy cattle. Experimental data were used and records on daily feed intake, weekly body weights, and weekly milk production were available from 548 heifers. Residual feed intake (MJ/d) is the difference between net energy intake and calculated net energy requirements for maintenance as a function of body weight and for fat- and protein-corrected milk production. Predicted methane emission (PME; g/d) is 6% of gross energy intake (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change methodology) corrected for energy content of methane (55.65 kJ/g). The estimated heritabilities for PME and RFI were 0.35 and 0.40, respectively. The positive genetic correlation between RFI and PME indicated that cows with lower RFI have lower PME (estimates ranging from 0.18 to 0.84). Hence, it is possible to decrease the methane production of a cow by selecting more-efficient cows, and the genetic variation suggests that reductions in the order of 11 to 26% in 10 yr are theoretically possible, and could be even higher in a genomic selection program. However, several uncertainties are discussed; for example, the lack of true methane measurements (and the key assumption that methane produced per unit feed is not affected by RFI level), as well as the limitations of predicting the biological consequences of selection.

In particular it is shown that aerosol emissions from such an aircraft fleet can have a relatively large impact on ozone, and possibly reduce the total atmospheric NO x by more than what is emitted by aircraft. Without aerosol emissions this aircraft fleet leads to similar NO x increases for subsonic (at 11\u201312 km) and supersonic (at 18\u201320 km) emissions, 1.35 ppbv and 0.83 ppbv as annual zonal means, respectively. H 2 O increases are also comparable at these altitudes: 630 and 599 ppbv, respectively. Tropospheric ozone increases are about 10 ppbv in the Northern Hemisphere due to emissions from subsonic aircraft. Increased ozone loss from supersonic aircraft at higher altitudes leads to ozone reductions of about 39 ppbv in the Northern Hemisphere and 22 ppbv in the Southern Hemisphere. The latter reduction is a result of transport of ozone depleted air from northern latitudes. When including aircraft aerosol emissions, NO x is reduced due to heterogeneous chemistry. The reduced NO x seems to counterweight the reduction of ozone from emissions of NO x and H 2 O above 20 km. At these altitudes the NO x (and thus ozone loss) reduction is large enough to give an aircraft emissions induced increase in ozone. In the height range 11\u201320 km altitude, however, ozone production is reduced. Heterogeneous reactions and reduced NO x enhances ClO, further enhancing ozone loss in the lower stratosphere. This results in a 14 ppbv additional reduction of ozone. Although supersonic aircraft have opposite effects on ozone in the upper and lower stratosphere, the change in ozone columns is clearly dominated by the upper stratospheric loss, thus supersonic aircraft aerosol emissions lead to enhanced ozone columns. The largest increase in the ozone column due to aerosol emissions is therefore seen in the Northern Hemispheric autumn and winter, giving a column increase of 4.5 DU.

Ozone pollution in eastern China has become one of the top environmental issues. Quantifying the temporal trend of surface ozone helps to assess the impacts of the anthropogenic precursor reductions and the likely effects of emission control strategies implemented. In this paper, ozone data collected at the Shangdianzi (SDZ) regional atmospheric background station from 2003 to 2015 are presented and analyzed to obtain the variation in the trend of surface ozone in the most polluted region of China, north of eastern China or the North China Plain. A modified Kolmogorov\u2013Zurbenko (KZ) filter method was performed on the maximum daily average 8 h (MDA8) concentrations of ozone to separate the contributions of different factors from the variation of surface ozone and remove the influence of meteorological fluctuations on surface ozone. Results reveal that the short-term, seasonal and long-term components of ozone account for 36.4, 57.6 and 2.2 % of the total variance, respectively. The long-term trend indicates that the MDA8 has undergone a significant increase in the period of 2003\u20132015, with an average rate of 1.13 \u00b1 0.01 ppb year\u22121 (R2 = 0.92).

These complexes display changes in their emission intensities and lifetimes upon analyte binding. Although the emission maxima exhibit small shifts in some cases, the emission profiles and spectral characteristics of the luminescent probes basically remain the same. Compared to common metal-to-ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) emitters, such as the ruthenium(II)\u2013 and osmium(II)\u2013polypyridine systems, iridium(III)\u2013polypyridine complexes exhibit emissive states that are very sensitive to their ligands and local environment, resulting in distinct emission features. However, it appears that this behavior has not been utilized in the current array of sensors available. Whilst dual emission is not uncommon for iridium(III)\u2013polypyridine complexes in glass at low temperature, it is very rare in fluid solutions under ambient conditions. We believe that an attractive approach to the development of new iridium(III)-based luminescent probes would be the utilization of novel complexes that display environment-responsive dualemissive properties.

Upon irradiation, 1 exhibited intense and long-lived luminescence (Table 1). Interestingly, it showed dual emission in fluid solutions at room temperature, with a high-energy (HE) structured band at about 500 nm (to = 1.1\u20132.5 ms) and a low-energy (LE) broad band/shoulder at approximately 593\u2013619 nm (to = 0.1\u2013 0.3 ms; Table 1). The possibility of emissive impurities in the samples was excluded on the basis of the characterization data. In degassed nonpolar solvents such as CH2Cl2, the emission intensity of the LE band was higher than or comparable to that of the HE band, whilst in more polar solvents such as CH3CN and CH3OH, it became much weaker; in aqueous buffer the spectrum was dominated by the HE band (Figure 1). The intensities of both the HE and LE emission features were reduced in aerated solutions, with the former being more sensitive to quenching by oxygen. As a result, the LE band became dominant in aerated solutions, except in the case of aqueous buffer. Addition of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) to an aerated solution of the complex in CH2Cl2 shifted the LE emission band to a shorter wavelength (ca. 574 nm) and the HE feature was eventually embedded into the broad LE band. Interestingly, the amine-free analogue complex [Ir(ppy)2(bpy-CONH-C2H5)](PF6) (1a ; Hppy = 2-phenylpyridine) did not display dual emission in fluid solutions (Table 1).

For wheat, we project small or occasionally negative effects of mitigation for projected yields, because of stronger CO2 fertilization effects than in maize, but substantial benefits of mitigation remain in terms of exposure to extremely high temperatures.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "6a5e8c80a824341562492d94ef4042de7bea5f48", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2762796980", "DOI": "10.1016/J.ENBUILD.2017.10.015", "CorpusId": 115744423}, "title": "Development of a CO2 emission benchmark for achieving the national CO2 emission reduction target by 2030", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "a206c2e9b0ee32eed67fcd3442c2f1d9710448dc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1481642727", "DOI": "10.1055/S-2003-44722", "CorpusId": 5821802, "PubMed": "15095130"}, "title": "Induction of poplar leaf nitrate reductase: a test of extrachloroplastic control of isoprene emission rate.", "abstract": "Several recent studies have suggested that control of isoprene emission rate is in part exerted by supply of extrachloroplastic phosphoenolpyruvate to the chloroplast. To test this hypothesis, we altered PEP supply by differential induction of cytosolic nitrate reductase (NR) and PEP carboxylase (PEPC) in plants of Populus deltoides grown with NO3- or NH4+ as the sole nitrogen source. Growth with 8 mM NH4+ produced a high leaf nitrogen concentration, compared with 8 mM NO3-, as well as slightly elevated rates of photosynthesis and significantly enhanced rates of isoprene emission and content of dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP, a precursor to isoprene biosynthesis), chlorophyll (a+b) and carotenoids. Growth with 8 mM NO3- resulted in parallel reductions in both leaf isoprene emission rate and DMAPP. The differential effects of growth with NH4+ or NO3- were not observed when plants were grown with 4 mM nitrogen. The effects of reduced DMAPP availability were specific to isoprene emission and were not propagated to higher isoprenoids, as the correlations between nitrogen content and either leaf chlorophyll (a+b) or total carotenoids were unaffected by nitrogen source. Biochemical analysis revealed significantly higher levels of NR and PEPC activity in leaves of 8 mM NO3- -grown plants, consistent with their fundamental roles in nitrate assimilation. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that foliar assimilation of NO3- reduces isoprene emission rate by competing for carbon skeletons (mediated by PEPC) within the cytosol and possibly reductant within the chloroplast. Cytosolic competition for PEP is a major regulator of chloroplast DMAPP supply, and we offer a new \"safety valve\" hypothesis to explain why plants emit isoprene.", "year": 2004}, {"paperId": "1aafd977aa80c54787e03f0d93f126edc6685b97", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2118996602", "DOI": "10.1007/S10584-009-9572-8", "CorpusId": 55731106}, "title": "Biological carbon sequestration and carbon trading re-visited", "abstract": "Biological activities that sequester carbon create CO2 offset credits that could obviate the need for reductions in fossil fuel use.

An assessment of current and future emissions, air concentrations, and atmospheric deposition of mercury worldwide is presented on the basis of results obtained during the performance of the EU GMOS (Global Mercury Observation System) project. Emission estimates for mercury were prepared with the main goal of applying them in models to assess current (2013) and future (2035) air concentrations and atmospheric deposition of this contaminant. The combustion of fossil fuels (mainly coal) for energy and heat production in power plants and in industrial and residential boilers, as well as artisanal and small-scale gold mining, is one of the major anthropogenic sources of Hg emissions to the atmosphere at present. These sources account for about 37 and 25\u202f% of the total anthropogenic Hg emissions globally, estimated to be about 2000\u202ft. Emissions in Asian countries, particularly in China and India, dominate the total emissions of Hg. The current estimates of mercury emissions from natural processes (primary mercury emissions and re-emissions), including mercury depletion events, were estimated to be 5207\u202ft\u202fyear\u22121, which represents nearly 70\u202f% of the global mercury emission budget. Oceans are the most important sources (36\u202f%), followed by biomass burning (9\u202f%). A comparison of the 2035 anthropogenic emissions estimated for three different scenarios with current anthropogenic emissions indicates a reduction of these emissions in 2035 up to 85\u202f% for the best-case scenario. Two global chemical transport models (GLEMOS and ECHMERIT) have been used for the evaluation of future mercury pollution levels considering future emission scenarios. Projections of future changes in mercury deposition on a global scale simulated by these models for three anthropogenic emissions scenarios of 2035 indicate a decrease in up to 50\u202f% deposition in the Northern Hemisphere and up to 35\u202f% in Southern Hemisphere for the best-case scenario. The EU GMOS project has proved to be a very important research instrument for supporting the scientific justification for the Minamata Convention and monitoring of the implementation of targets of this convention, as well as the EU Mercury Strategy.

The paper proposes a specific cap-and-trade system with several key features, including an upstream cap on CO2 emissions, with gradual inclusion of other greenhouse gases, a gradual downward trajectory of emissions ceilings over time, to minimize disruption and allow firms and households time to adapt, and mechanisms to reduce cost uncertainty. Initially, half of the program\u2019s allowances would be allocated through auctioning and half through free distribution, primarily to those entities most burdened by the policy. This should help limit potential inequities while bolstering political support. The share distributed for free would phase out over twenty-five years. The auctioned allowances would generate revenue that could be used for a variety of worthwhile public purposes. The system would provide for linkage with international emissions reduction credit arrangements, harmonization over time with effective cap-and-trade systems in other countries, and appropriate linkage with other actions taken abroad that maintains a level playing field between imports and import-competing domestic products.", "year": 2007}, {"paperId": "85b9266e001fdb5c2ce675b8a576f56407b20e4c", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1510254139", "DOI": "10.4271/2001-01-3259", "CorpusId": 136649295}, "title": "Reduction of Diesel Engine Emissions by Water Injection", "abstract": null, "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "965bc909eb307e84f252f60ce3136f6d258188f0", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2025763429", "DOI": "10.1007/BF00284223", "CorpusId": 95719255}, "title": "Water quality improvements in the Sudbury, Ontario, Canada area related to reduced smelter emissions", "abstract": "Data from water quality studies conducted in the Sudbury, Ontario, Canada area indicate that substantial decreases in the acidity of surface waters have accompanied reductions in SO2 emissions from the Sudbury smelting industry since 1977.

In this approach, emissions and initial concentrations are optimised simultaneously, thus allowing inversions to be carried out on time scales of weeks to months, short compared with the lifetime of methane. Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the method and to investigate the utility of SCIAMACHY observations for methane source estimation. The impact of a number of parameters on the error in the methane emission field retrieved has been analysed. These parameters include the measurement error, the error introduced by the presence of clouds, and the spatial resolution of the emission field. It is shown that 4D-var is an efficient method to deal with large amounts of satellite data and to retrieve emissions at high resolution. Some important conclusions regarding the SCIAMACHY measurements can be drawn. (i) The observations at their estimated precision of 1.5 to 2% will contribute considerably to uncertainty reduction in monthly, subcontinental (~500 km) methane source strengths. (ii) Systematic measurement errors well below 1% have a dramatic impact on the quality of the derived emission fields. Hence, every effort should be made to identify and remove such systematic errors. (iii) It is essential to take partly cloudy pixels into account in order to achieve sufficient spatial coverage.

Ambient volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured using an online system, gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry/flame ionization detector (GC-MS/FID), in Beijing, China, before, during, and after Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) China 2014, when stringent air quality control measures were implemented. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to identify the major VOC contributing sources and their temporal variations. The secondary organic aerosols potential (SOAP) approach was used to estimate variations of precursor source contributions to SOA formation. The average VOC mixing ratios during the three periods were 86.17, 48.28, and 72.97 ppbv, respectively. The mixing ratios of total VOC during the control period were reduced by 44 %, and the mixing ratios of acetonitrile, halocarbons, oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), aromatics, acetylene, alkanes, and alkenes decreased by approximately 65, 62, 54, 53, 37, 36, and 23 %, respectively. The mixing ratios of all measured VOC species decreased during control, and the most affected species were chlorinated VOCs (chloroethane, 1,1-dichloroethylene, chlorobenzene). PMF analysis indicated eight major sources of ambient VOCs, and emissions from target control sources were clearly reduced during the control period. Compared with the values before control, contributions of vehicular exhaust were most reduced, followed by industrial manufacturing and solvent utilization. Reductions of these three sources were responsible for 50, 26, and 16 % of the reductions in ambient VOCs. Contributions of evaporated or liquid gasoline and industrial chemical feedstock were slightly reduced, and contributions of secondary and long-lived species were relatively stable. Due to central heating, emissions from fuel combustion kept on increasing during the whole campaign; because of weak control of liquid petroleum gas (LPG), the highest emissions of LPG occurred in the control period.

We review the existing quantitative analyses on the subject and introduce some of the mathematical challenges posed by the implementation of the new phase of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme as well as the cap-and-trade schemes touted by the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Japan. From a practical point of view, the main thrust of the paper is the design and numerical analysis of new cap-and-trade schemes for the control and reduction of atmospheric pollution. We develop tools intended to help policy makers and regulators understand the pros and cons of the emissions markets. We propose a model for an economy where risk neutral firms produce goods to satisfy an inelastic demand and are endowed with permits in order to offset their pollution at compliance time and avoid having to pay a penalty. Firms that can easily reduce emissions do so, while those for which it is harder buy permits from firms that anticipate they will not need all their permits, creating a financial market for pollution credits. Our equilibrium model elucidates the joint price formation for goods and pollution allowances, capturing most of the features of the first phase of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme. We show existence of an equilibrium and uniqueness of emissions credit prices. We also characterize the equilibrium prices of goods and the optimal production and trading strategies of the firms. We use the electricity market in Texas to numerically illustrate the qualitative properties of these cap-and-trade schemes. Comparing the numerical implications of cap-and-trade schemes to the business-as-usual benchmark, we show that our numerical results match those observed during the implementation of the first phase of the European Union cap-and-trade CO${}_2$ emissions scheme.

At the same time, pressure is being placed on poultry producers from interested groups and neighbors to reduce ammonia emissions for environmental reasons. Since the current procedure for reducing ammonia levels in houses is to exhaust air as much as possible, this will, in some part, conflict with efforts to reduce ammonia emissions from poultry live production facilities. Research will be needed from the industry and academia to develop methods of reducing nitrogen excreted by poultry, e.g., research in nutrition, genetics, poultry husbandry, and management. Research is needed to improve or develop methods of manure management and treatment that will reduce ammonia emissions. Research is also needed in developing methods of closing the loop, using nitrogen in poultry manures to produce crops that can be fed back to poultry. Importing major quantities of feedstuffs from other regions of the country and depositing manure onto low-productivity pastures or cropland may not be sustainable.

Despite considerable scholarly scrutiny, there remain debates about whether they reduce pollution among participants, and their overall impact at the country level. We present a cross-national analysis of the efficacy of ISO 14001, the most widely adopted voluntary environmental program in the world. While several single country studies have explored the effect of ISO 14001 participation on pollution reduction at the facility level, this is the first article to assess (i) national level pollution reduction effects of ISO 14001 participation levels, (ii) across a large number of countries, and (iii) across two pollutants. We examine whether all else equal, the national level uptakes of ISO 14001 are associated with reductions in air emissions (sulfur dioxide, SO2) and water pollution (biochemical oxygen demand, BOD). Because firms, regulators, and environmental groups tend to focus more on visible types of pollution than less visible ones, we hypothesize that ISO 14001 uptake will be associated with more pronounced reductions in air pollution (visible) in relation to water pollution (less visible). Our analyses of pollution levels for a panel of 138 (72 for BOD) countries for the 1991\u20102005 period suggest that a 1 percent increase in aggregate levels of ISO 14001 adoption is associated with about a 0.064 percent reduction in SO2 emissions, all else equal. In contrast, we do not find a statistically significant relationship between ISO 14001 adoption levels and changes in water pollution (BOD).", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "b44059c249af2d2858b66f1ecaef1f6d894b6a98", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1974817000", "DOI": "10.3724/SP.J.1248.2010.00027", "CorpusId": 153770419}, "title": "Estimating the Macroeconomic Costs of CO2 Emission Reduction in China Based on Multi-objective Programming", "abstract": "Abstract This paper estimates the macroeconomic costs of CO 2 emission reduction in China employing the input-output analysis with the multi-objective programming approach.

The recent IPCC reports state that continued anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are changing the climate, threatening severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts. Slow progress in emissions reduction to mitigate climate change is resulting in increased attention to what is called geoengineering, climate engineering, or climate intervention \u2013 deliberate interventions to counter climate change that seek to either modify the Earth's radiation budget or remove greenhouse gases such as CO2 from the atmosphere. When focused on CO2, the latter of these categories is called carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Future emission scenarios that stay well below 2\u202f\u00b0C, and all emission scenarios that do not exceed 1.5\u202f\u00b0C warming by the year 2100, require some form of CDR. At present, there is little consensus on the climate impacts and atmospheric CO2 reduction efficacy of the different types of proposed CDR. To address this need, the Carbon Dioxide Removal Model Intercomparison Project (or CDRMIP) was initiated. This project brings together models of the Earth system in a common framework to explore the potential, impacts, and challenges of CDR. Here, we describe the first set of CDRMIP experiments, which are formally part of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). These experiments are designed to address questions concerning CDR-induced climate reversibility , the response of the Earth system to direct atmospheric CO2 removal (direct air capture and storage), and the CDR potential and impacts of afforestation and reforestation, as well as ocean alkalinization.>", "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "64c196d56da60a1f59da8264bbca2cc0c0ac44d2", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2023612745", "DOI": "10.1007/BF02541648", "CorpusId": 95354648}, "title": "Methyl and ethyl soybean esters as renewable fuels for diesel engines", "abstract": "The primary problems associated with using straight soybean oil as a fuel in a compression ignition internal combustion engine are caused by high fuel viscosity. Transesterification of soybean oil with an alcohol provides a significant reduction in viscosity, thereby enhancing the physical properties of the renewable fuel to improve engine performance. The ethyl and methyl esters of soybean oil with commercial diesel fuel additives revealed fuel properties that compared very well with diesel fuel, with the exception of gum formation, which manifested itself in problems with the plugging of fuel filters. Engine performance using soybean ester fuels differed little from engine performance with diesel fuel. A slight power loss combined with an increase in fuel consumption were experienced with the esters, primarily because of the lower heating value of the esters than for diesel fuel. Emissions for the 2 fuels were similar, with nitrous oxide emissions higher for the esters. Measurements of engine wear and fuel-injection system tests showed no abnormal characteristics for any of the fuels after the 200-hr tests. Engine deposits were comparable in amount, but slightly different in color and texture, with the methyl ester engine experiencing greater carbon and varnish deposits on the pistons.", "year": 1984}, {"paperId": "f4787b3f56f44a06e83594b0e91fd550fad92c32", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2041913340", "DOI": "10.1111/J.1475-4932.1992.TB01747.X", "CorpusId": 154855498}, "title": "Accounting for Australian Carbon Dioxide Emissions", "abstract": "This paper provides an accounting for carbon dioxide emissions arising in Australia by final demand deliveries responsible using input-output and primary energy input data for 1982-83.

However, modifying only one 4R component does not consistently reduce nitrous oxide (NO) emissions. Our objective was to determine if N fertilizer applied in three split applications (Sp), by itself or combined with changes in N source and rate, could improve N recovery efficiency (NRE) and N surplus (NS) and decrease NO emissions. Over two corn ( L.) growing seasons in Minnesota, NO emissions ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 kg N ha. None of the treatment combinations affected grain yield. Compared with urea applied in a single application at the recommended N rate, Sp by itself did not improve NRE or NS and did not decrease NO. Combining Sp with urease and nitrification inhibitors and/or a 15% reduction in N rate increased NRE from 57 to >73% and decreased NS by >20 kg N ha. The only treatment that decreased NO (by 20-53%) was Sp combined with inhibitors and reduced N rate. Emissions of NO were more strongly correlated with NS calculated from grain N uptake ( = 0.61) compared with whole-plant N uptake ( = 0.39), possibly because most N losses occurred before grain filling. Optimizing both application timing and N source can allow for a moderate reduction in N rate that does not affect grain yield but decreases NO. Grain-based NS may be a more useful indicator of NO emissions than whole-plant-based NS.", "year": 2016}]}
