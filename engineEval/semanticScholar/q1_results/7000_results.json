Recent research suggests that GHG fluxes from dung pats could be affected by biotic interactions involving dung beetles. Whether and how these effects vary among beetle species and with assemblage composition is yet to be established. To examine the link between GHGs and different dung beetle species assemblages, we used a closed chamber system to measure fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) from cattle dung pats. Targeting a total of four dung beetle species (a pat-dwelling species, a roller of dung balls, a large and a small tunnelling species), we ran six experimental treatments (four monospecific and two mixed) and two controls (one with dung but without beetles, and one with neither dung nor beetles). In this setting, the overall presence of beetles significantly affected the gas fluxes, but different species contributed unequally to GHG emissions. When compared to the control with dung, we detected an overall reduction in the total cumulative CO2 flux from all treatments with beetles and a reduction in N2O flux from the treatments with the three most abundant dung beetle species. These reductions can be seen as beneficial ecosystem services. Nonetheless, we also observed a disservice provided by the large tunneler, Copris lunaris, which significantly increased the CH4 flux\u2013an effect potentially traceable to the species\u2019 nesting strategy involving the construction of large brood balls. When fluxes were summed into CO2-equivalents across individual GHG compounds, dung with beetles proved to emit less GHGs than did beetle-free dung, with the mix of the three most abundant species providing the highest reduction (-32%).

The active layers were fabricated with different concentrations of Si by both ion implantation and plasma-enhanced chemical vapour deposition. Devices fabricated by ion implantation exhibit a combination of direct current and field-effect luminescence under a bipolar pulsed excitation. The onset of the emission decreases with the Si excess from 6 to 3 V. The direct current emission is attributed to impact ionization and is associated with the reasonably high current levels observed in current-voltage measurements. This behaviour is in good agreement with transmission electron microscopy images that revealed a continuous and uniform Si nanocrystal distribution. The emission power efficiency is relatively low, approximately 10(-3)%, and the emission intensity exhibits fast degradation rates, as revealed from accelerated ageing experiments. Devices fabricated by chemical deposition only exhibit field-effect luminescence, whose onset decreases with the Si excess from 20 to 6 V. The absence of the continuous emission is explained by the observation of a 5 nm region free of nanocrystals, which strongly reduces the direct current through the gate. The main benefit of having this nanocrystal-free region is that tunnelling current flow assisted by nanocrystals is blocked by the SiO2 stack so that power consumption is strongly reduced, which in return increases the device power efficiency up to 0.1%.

Traditional land management (no tillage, no drainage, NTND) during the winter fallow season results in substantial CH4 and N2O emissions from double-rice fields in China. A field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of drainage and tillage during the winter fallow season on CH4 and N2O emissions and to develop mitigation options. The experiment had four treatments: NTND, NTD (drainage but no tillage), TND (tillage but no drainage), and TD (both drainage and tillage).

Recent controls to reduce the emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides (SOX and NOX) have increased the importance of understanding the role ammonia plays in the formation of surface fine inorganic particulate matter (PM2.5) in the United States. In this study, we identify the interannual variability in ammonia concentration, explore the sources of this variability and determine their contribution to the variability in surface PM2.5 concentration. Over the summers of 2008-2012, measurements from the Ammonia Monitoring Network (AMoN) and the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) satellite instrument show considerable variability in both surface and column ammonia concentrations (+/- 29% and 28% of the mean), respectively. This observed variability is larger than that simulated by the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, where meteorology dominates the variability in ammonia and PM2.5 concentrations compared to the changes caused by SOX and NOX reductions. Our initial simulation does not include year-to-year changes in ammonia agricultural emissions. We use county-wide information on fertilizer sales and livestock populations, as well as meteorological variations to account for the interannual variability in agricultural activity and ammonia volatilization.

Here we show that the increase in aerosols over the twentieth century has led to contraction of the northern tropical belt, thereby offsetting part of the widening associated with the increase in GHGs. Over the 21st century, however, when aerosol emissions are projected to decrease, the effects of aerosols and GHGs reinforce one another, both contributing to widening of the northern tropical belt. Models that have larger aerosol forcing, by including aerosol indirect effects on cloud albedo and lifetime, yield significantly larger Northern Hemisphere (NH) tropical widening than models with direct aerosol effects only. More targeted simulations show that future reductions in aerosols can drive NH tropical widening as large as greenhouse gases, and idealized simulations show the importance of NH midlatitude aerosol forcing. Mechanistically, the 21st century reduction in aerosols peaks near 40\u00b0N, which results in a corresponding maximum increase in surface solar radiation, NH midlatitude tropospheric warming amplification, and a poleward shift in the latitude of maximum baroclinicity, implying a corresponding shift in atmospheric circulation.

The challenges to such a comparison can be divided into three groups. The first refers to changes that are directly linked to the characteristics of PRTRs: both the changes within a specific system over time and variations among different systems. The second refers to parameters that affect the outcomes of the systems without being directly a part of them. The third involves the relations between the emissions reported to the PRTRs and the associated environmental risk. We suggest an approach that relies on relative comparison, commensurate with the unique characteristics of each PRTR, that compares their actual outcomes. Such an approach is necessary both due to significant variations among current PRTRs as well as for following the unique policy objectives that are manifested in different PRTRs. Application of this comparative approach in the United States, England, Canada, and Australia demonstrates significant differences in PRTR systems across countries and suggests that the mere presence of a PRTR may not lead to reduced industrial emissions.

The two groups were matched for age, disease duration and severity and daily intake of levodopa equivalent units. None had a history of depression or sleep disturbance. Using a region of interest analytical approach, we found that patients with fatigue had significantly lower serotonin transporter binding than patients without fatigue in the caudate, putamen, ventral striatum and thalamus. Striatal \u00b9\u2078F-dopa uptake was similar in the fatigued and non-fatigued groups. Voxel-based analysis localized further relative serotonin transporter binding reductions in the cingulate and amygdala of the fatigue group, and \u00b9\u2078F-dopa uptake reductions in the caudate and insula. We conclude that fatigue in Parkinson's disease is associated with reduced serotonergic function in the basal ganglia and limbic structures. Insular dopaminergic dysfunction could also play a role. These findings imply that strategies to increase brain level of serotonin would be a rational approach for relieving fatigue symptoms in Parkinson's disease and may also be relevant to alleviating fatigue in other clinical conditions.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "903d6a9699465ed219afdfd97c679a71b5171b63", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2200710387", "CorpusId": 110824699}, "title": "MEASUREMENT OF HIGHWAY-RELATED NOISE", "abstract": "The U.S. Department of Transportation, Research and Special Programs Administration, John A.

Historically, China used too little Nr in its agriculture to feed its population. However, with the rapid increase in N fertilizer use for food production and fossil fuel consumption for energy supply over the last four decades, increasing gaseous Nr species (e.g. NH3 and NOx) have been emitted to the atmosphere and then deposited as wet and dry deposition, with adverse impacts on air, water and soil quality as well as plant biodiversity and human health. This paper reviews the issues associated with this in a holistic way. The emissions, deposition, impacts, actions and regulations for the mitigation of atmospheric Nr are discussed systematically. Both NH3 and NOx make major contributions to environmental pollution but especially to the formation of secondary fine particulate matter (PM2.5), which impacts human health and light scattering (haze). In addition, atmospheric deposition of NH3 and NOx causes adverse impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems due to acidification and eutrophication. Regulations and practices introduced by China that meet the urgent need to reduce Nr emissions are explained and resulting effects on emissions are discussed.

The largest carbon sequestration and saving contribution possible comes from an increase in the proportion of permanent woodland, such that a 10% change in land use could amount to 9 Mt C yr\u22121 in the initial years (arable and grassland). Changes in arable management could make a significant contribution to an abatement strategy if carried out in concert with greater use of permanent conservation field margins, increased returns of crop residues and reduced tillage systems, contributing 1.3 Mt C yr\u22121 in the initial years.

However, general trends have been found, showing significant sensitivity to ventilation rate, U-values, occupant behaviour and location. Heating demand will still be dominant over cooling demand in UK dwellings by the 2080s, based on an UKCIP02 A1F1 weather scenario. A national worst case scenario for the 2050s, shows a 10 megatonne CO2 emissions saving on present levels largely due to a 20% reduction in gas consumption. Practical applications: The balance of heating and cooling demand causes more modest changes in CO 2 than first anticipated. Despite first perceptions of future energy use in housing and climate change, heating appears to remain the major load rather than cooling, even into the 2080s. These predictions of future CO 2 emissions will be useful to those in the building industry planning appropriate proportionate climate adaptation and climate mitigation measures.

Nowadays, the switching frequency of power converters has been increasing up to values that make feasible the application of such techniques to reduce EMI emissions in power circuits. This paper deals with SSCG applied to reduction of EMI emissions in switched power converters, following certain modulation profiles. It is focussed on studying the effectiveness of EMI reduction as a function of frequency ranges, modulation profiles and other modulation parameters. A buck converter, whose switching frequency can be swept from 100 kHz to 1 MHz, has been used for experimental validation. Conducted disturbances produced by the converter, using different modulation parameters, were measured and compared with those produced by the same converter when driven with the classical constant frequency, variable duty, switching pattern.

The use of quasar referenced ARIES Mobile VLBI to establish a sparse fundamental control grid will provide a basis for making SERIES GPS measurements traceable to the time-invariant quasar directions. Using four SERIES stations deployed at previously established ARIES sites, allows the GPS satellite apparent positions to be determined. These apparent positions then serve as calibrations for other SERIES stations at unknown locations to determine their positions in a manner traceable to the quasars. Because this proposed radio interferometric configuration accomplishes its signal detection by cross-correlation, there is no dependence upon knowledge of the GPS transmitted waveforms which might be encrypted. Since GPS radio signal strengths are 105 stronger than quasar signals, a great reduction in telecommunications sophistication is possible which will result in an order of magnitude less cost for a SERIES GPS station compared to a quasar based mobile VLBI system.

Nitrification inhibitors are seen as a potential technology to reduce these N2O emissions from agricultural soils. In previous studies on the effect of dicyandiamide (DCD) on N2O emissions from animal excreta, DCD was directly applied to urine. However, farmers apply DCD to grazed pastures shortly before or after grazing rather than applying it specifically to the urine patches. Accordingly, the objectives of this study were: (1) to test, using chamber measurements, whether the same level of N2O reduction is achieved under grazed conditions where excretal N is non-uniformly deposited, (2) to apply the process-based NZ-DNDC model to simulate the effect of DCD on emission reductions, and (3) to perform a sensitivity analysis on the NZ-DNDC model to investigate how uncertainties in the input parameters affect the modelled N2O emissions. Two circular 1260-m2 treatment plots were grazed simultaneously for 5\u2009h, by 20 cattle on each plot. The following day, DCD was applied in 800\u2009L of water to one of the plots at 10\u2009kg/ha and N2O emissions were measured periodically for 20 days. The cumulative N2O emissions were 220\u2009\u00b1\u200990 and 110\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u2009g N2O-N/ha for the untreated and DCD-treated plots, respectively (based on the arithmetic mean and standard error of the chambers). This suggests a reduction in N2O emission from DCD application of ~50\u2009\u00b1\u200940% from a single grazing event. However, this result should be treated with caution because the possibility of sampling error due to the chamber distribution cannot be excluded. NZ-DNDC simulated N2O emissions of 169 and 68\u2009g N2O-N/ha for the untreated and DCD-treated areas, respectively, corresponding to a reduction of 60% in N2O emissions from DCD application. This level of reduction is consistent with that found in experiments with individual urine patches. N2O emissions found through use of NZ-DNDC were sensitive to uncertainties in the input parameters.

Methanogenesis in the rumen is thought to represent a 2-12% loss of energy intake and is estimated to be about 15% of total atmospheric methane emissions. While methanogenesis in the rumen is conducted by methanogens, PCR-based techniques have recently detected many uncultured methanogens which have a broader phylogenetic range than cultured strains isolated from the rumen. Strategies for reduction of methane emissions from the rumen have been proposed. These include 1) control of components in feed, 2) application of feed additives and 3) biological control of rumen fermentation. In any case, although it could be possible that repression of hydrogen-producing reactions leads to abatement of methane production, repression of hydrogen-producing reactions means repression of the activity of rumen fermentation and leads to restrained digestibility of carbohydrates and suppression of microbial growth. Thus, in order to reduce the flow of hydrogen into methane production, hydrogen should be diverted into propionate production via lactate or fumarate.", "year": 2008}, {"paperId": "05178c353de511cb769b5e5ce2c462201d41e677", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1969985116", "DOI": "10.1016/S0920-5861(02)00092-5", "CorpusId": 93933269}, "title": "Novel low temperature NOx storage-reduction catalysts for diesel light-duty engine emissions based on hydrotalcite compounds", "abstract": null, "year": 2002}, {"paperId": "7f1e3dcfae3d082e50481c6fd9d264d64b0b0702", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2511390021", "DOI": "10.1111/gcb.13467", "CorpusId": 6020331, "PubMed": "27536811"}, "title": "Molecular mechanisms of water table lowering and nitrogen deposition in affecting greenhouse gas emissions from a Tibetan alpine wetland", "abstract": "Rapid climate change and intensified human activities have resulted in water table lowering (WTL) and enhanced nitrogen (N) deposition in Tibetan alpine wetlands.

N deposition increased net CO2 uptake by 25.2% in comparison with no\u2010N deposition plots and turned the mesocosms from N2O sinks to N2O sources, but had little influence on CH4 emissions. The interactions between WTL and N deposition were not detected in all GHG emissions.

However, achieving these goals is difficult because current carbon accounting efforts are spread across three distinct organisational fields, each prioritising different goals. This paper aims to address these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The authors identified three fields drawn together by the science of how carbon emissions can be measured, the social practices of carbon accounting, and accountability within the global carbon governance system. The authors hosted a workshop, and invited representatives participating in each of the organisational fields to highlight the contentious conversations within their field. The authors facilitated an across-field exploration of whether and how to achieve accuracy, consistency and certainty in carbon accounting. Findings - It was found that there are tensions between accuracy, consistency and certainty in carbon accounting both within and across organisational fields. Framing the evolution of carbon accounting as negotiation between these goals across fields yields powerful implications for addressing current challenges in carbon accounting. Practical implications - The authors provide guidance to policymakers on how to recognise legitimate uncertainty in carbon management science, manage the cost-benefits of policy and reporting mechanisms, and ensure actual greenhouse gas emissions reductions.

However, for a country to assess emission reductions due to grassland management, there must be an inventory method for estimating the change in SOC storage. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed a simple carbon accounting approach for this purpose, and here we derive new grassland management factors that represent the effect of changing management on carbon storage for this method. Our literature search identified 49 studies dealing with effects of management practices that either degraded or improved conditions relative to nominally managed grasslands. On average, degradation reduced SOC storage to 95% \u00b1 0.06 and 97% \u00b1 0.05 of carbon stored under nominal conditions in temperate and tropical regions, respectively. In contrast, improving grasslands with a single management activity enhanced SOC storage by 14% \u00b1 0.06 and 17% \u00b1 0.05 in temperate and tropical regions, respectively, and with an additional improvement(s), storage increased by another 11% \u00b1 0.04.

To compare with field measurements, simulated scenarios included a shallow drip application at 2.5 cm, covered with a polyethylene film; a deep drip application at 20.3 cm with bare soil surface; and a conventional shank injection at 30.5 cm with a regular application rate. A convective and diffusive two-dimensional model was used to simulate the simultaneous transport of 1,3-D in both liquid and gaseous phases. Diurnal variations of soil temperature were predicted to calculate 1,3-D diffusion coefficient and the Henry's constant. Predicted 1,3-D emissions compared well with field measurements for the shallow and deep drip irrigation treatments. The model simulation underpredicted 1,3-D emission in the shank injection plot, where other transport mechanisms such as gas phase convection likely occurred during and immediately after application.

The d-PeT effect is characterized by a lower background fluorescence at acidic pH than at neutral pH, which is in stark contrast to the normal a-PeT effect (fluorophore as the electron acceptor of the ET) that shows a strong and undesired background fluorescence at acidic pH. Our experimental results confirmed the theoretical predictions and d-PeT was observed for two of the sensors (with p-dimethylaminophenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core). For the third sensor (with phenylethynyl substitution at 6- position of the carbazole core), however, not d-PeT but rather the normal a-PeT was observed. The discrepancy between the DFT/TDDFT calculations and the experimental observations can be rationalized using free energy changes (Rehm-Weller equations) and the rate constants for the ET (k(ET), Marcus equation). These new d-PeT boronic acid sensors show improved photophysical properties compared to the known d-PeT sensor reported previously by us. In particular, the fluorescence transduction efficiency of the new sensors was improved 8-fold when compared to the known d-PeT boronic acid sensors. Novel fluorescence enhancement/reduction was observed for one of the sensors upon binding with mandelic acid or tartaric acid at pH 5.6.

The exhaust emission characteristics of the D.F.D.E needs further refinements, particularly in terms of reduction of Unburnt Hydrocarbons (U7HC) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) emission, because the concentration of these pollutants are higher than that of the baseline diesel engine. Furthermore, the combustion process in a typical D.F.D.E tends to be complex, showing combination of the problems encountered both in diesel and spark ignition (SI.) engines. In this work, a computer code has been modified for simulation of D.F.D.E combustion process. This model simulates D.F.D.E combustion by using a Multi-Zone Combustion Model (MZCM) for diesel pilot jet combustion and a conventional S .1. combustion model for modeling of combustion of premixed gas/air charge . Also, in this model, there are four sub models for prediction of major emission pollutants such as: UHC, NO, CO and soot which are emitted from D.F.D.E. For prediction of formation and oxidation rates of pollutants, relevant conventional kinetically-controlled mechanisms and mass balances are used.

Although some dye bleaching was observed, the main factor responsible for the reduction in the overall emission efficiency was found to be nonlinear changes in the director-axis reorientation.

Nine modeling teams have participated in this joint effort to quantify a wide range of mitigation and stabilization scenarios. The nine modeling approaches involve different methodologies, data, regional aggregations and other salient characteristics. This pluralism of approaches and alternative baselines serves to cover some of the uncertainties embedded across a range of different mitigation and stabilization strategies. At the same time, several common trends and characteristics can be observed across the set of Post-SRES scenarios. First, the different baseline \u201cworlds\u201d described in the SRES scenarios require different technology/policy measures to stabilize atmospheric CO2 concentrations at the same level. Second, no one single measure will be sufficient for the timely development, adoption and diffusion of mitigation options to achieve stabilization.

Reducing or eliminating the mercury contents in household products, particularly batteries and fluorescent lamps, should be the top priority in controlling mercury in MSW, while it is also important to set mercury contents in consumer products at acceptable and achievable levels based on a life-cycle approach.

The data on both electronic toll collection (ETC) lanes and manual toll collection (MTC) lanes were assembled for comparison. Then an analysis showed that all emissions were reduced by using ETC; however, the reduction in nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission was much less than that for hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) for the testing vehicle. Further, emission estimation approaches based on vehicle specific power (VSP) were studied with the collected data, and some errors in common were identified. For the toll station, the VSP interval [-2, 2] was found to be a critical interval in the driving modes as well as in the average emission rates. A finer binning approach was applied, and the accuracy of the emission estimation for the toll station was improved. Subsequently, a comprehensive analysis of speed, VSP, and the accumulated emissions around the tollbooths was conducted to explain why the percentage of NOx reduction was much less than those for HC and CO.

Business is attracted by this solution because free initial distribution of permits both favours existing sources financially and, furthermore, creates a barrier to entry for new firms. Environmentalist groups have changed attitudes and promote the idea too as a way of negotiating higher target reduction levels with industry to maintain voluntary contributions from their members. Finally, electric utilities prefer a grandfathered permit market, and this step towards less planned economy may be explained by the rise of competition in the U.S. electricity sector. Therefore, it is suggested that a grandfathered permit market is a more effective policy than a tax in relation to organized interests such as industry, electric utilities and environmental organizations. In perspective, the grandfathered permit market may be mixed with the use of taxes.

Furthermore, in PD, administration of levodopa is associated with further hypometabolism in orbitofrontal cortex; an area known to be relevant for reversal learning where performance is typically impaired after dopaminergic treatment. \u00a9 2001 Movement Disorder Society.", "year": 2001}, {"paperId": "287e53dd278890424b0cca9727fa6838860588eb", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1587895538", "DOI": "10.4271/2006-01-0377", "CorpusId": 34867119}, "title": "Well-to-Wheels Results of Energy Use, Greenhouse Gas Emissions, and Criteria Air Pollutant Emissions of Selected Vehicle/Fuel Systems", "abstract": "A fuel-cycle model\u2014called the Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation (GREET) model\u2014has been developed at Argonne National Laboratory to evaluate well-to-wheels (WTW) energy and emission impacts of motor vehicle technologies fueled with various transportation fuels. The new GREET version has up-to-date information regarding energy use and emissions for fuel production activities and vehicle operations. In this study, a complete WTW evaluation targeting energy use, greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O), and typical criteria air pollutants (VOC, NOX and PM10) includes the following fuel options \u2013 gasoline, diesel and hydrogen; and the following vehicle technologies \u2013 spark-ignition engines with or without hybrid configurations, compression-ignition engines with hybrid configurations, and hydrogen fuel cells with hybrid configurations. Based on the detailed up-to-date data, probability-based distribution functions for key input parameters regarding WTP activities and vehicle operations were built into GREET to address the uncertainties of energy use and emissions. The WTW analysis shows that advanced vehicle/fuel systems achieve reductions in energy use, GHG emissions and criteria pollutant emissions compared to baseline gasoline vehicles by 1) improved vehicle fuel economy, 2) declined tailpipe/evaporative vehicle emissions, and/or 3) differences in fuel production pathways.", "year": 2006}, {"paperId": "217dff5eb3fcf866effa9fd330b50a6b7ffc9ce5", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2795410076", "DOI": "10.1002/2015JD024454", "CorpusId": 131554336}, "title": "Source identification of VOCs at an urban site of western India: Effect of marathon events and anthropogenic emissions", "abstract": "Ambient volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured using a high\u2010resolution proton transfer reaction\u2010time of flight\u2010mass spectrometer at an urban site of Ahmedabad in India during the winter season in 2014. Mixing ratios of VOCs show large diurnal and day\u2010to\u2010day variations. Although strongly influenced by local emissions, periods of higher VOCs were observed during transport from the polluted Indo\u2010Gangetic Plains than those from the cleaner Thar Desert. However with different rates, VOCs decreased exponentially with increasing wind speed. Relative abundance of methanol varied with weather conditions contributing highest and lowest under fog and clear\u2010sky conditions, respectively. Among the compounds reported here, oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) contribute to a large fraction (67\u201385%) with methanol being most abundant (40\u201358%). In spite of predominant vehicular emissions, diurnal distribution and emission ratios (ERs) of several VOCs indicate the role of biogenic and secondary sources. The ratios of isoprene/benzene and OVOCs/benzene show significant enhancements during daytime suggesting their contributions from biogenic and secondary sources. During marathon and cyclothon events, mixing ratios of VOCs were 2\u201310 times higher compared to a normal Sunday. The ERs of VOCs estimated using the nighttime data on marathon day are well within the range of values reported for several megacities of the world.

This may provide benefits of three types: a) shared responsibility for reducing a major driver of global climate change, b) financial payments and co-investment that exceed the economic opportunities foregone from decisions to maintain carbon stocks, and c) co-benefits through the other environmental service functions that well-maintained forests can provide. Given its track record of high emissions from land use and land use change of an estimated 2.5 Gt CO2e year-1, Indonesia provides a huge opportunity as well as serious challenge to reduce emissions. We report here on a series of stakeholder consultations and focus group discussions to identify options and challenges. To ensure demonstrable results on emission reduction, REDD mechanisms must be effective in targeting the wide range of agents involved in deforestation and degradation, learning lessons from past and ongoing conservation efforts that have apparently failed. They must reward good performance and incentivize improved performance compared to reference scenarios, and adequately compensate agents that suffer losses from changed practices. International payments are likely to be performance based, both in terms of emission reduction at national scale and the environmental and social impacts of the system, meaning that accountability, transparency, risk management, adequate benefits transfer and administration mechanisms will be essential for attracting investment. Indonesia will be effectively competing for attention and REDD funds with other countries with currently high pemissions and/or large forest areas.

II. Statistical methods for foreground wedge reduction", "abstract": "For there to be a successful measurement of the 21 cm Epoch of Reionization (EoR) power spectrum, it is crucial that strong foreground contaminants be robustly suppressed. These foregrounds come from a variety of sources (such as Galactic synchrotron emission and extragalactic point sources), but almost all share the property of being spectrally smooth, and when viewed through the chromatic response of an interferometer, occupy a signature \\wedge\" region in cylindrical k?kk Fourier space. The complement of the foreground wedge is termed the \\EoR window\", and is expected to be mostly foreground-free, allowing clean measurements of the power spectrum. This paper is a sequel to a previous paper that established a rigorous mathematical framework for describing the foreground wedge and the EoR window. Here, we use our framework to explore statistical methods by which the EoR window can be enlarged, thereby increasing the sensitivity of a power spectrum measurement. We adapt the Feldman-Kaiser-Peacock approximation (commonly used in galaxy surveys) for 21 cm cosmology, and also compare the optimal quadratic estimator to simpler estimators that ignore covariances between dierent Fourier modes. The optimal quadratic estimator is found to suppress foregrounds by an extra factor of 10 5 in power at the peripheries of the EoR window, boosting the detection of the cosmological signal from 12 to 50 at the midpoint of reionization in our ducial models. If numerical issues can be nessed, decorrelation techniques allow the EoR window to be further enlarged, enabling measurements to be made deep within the foreground wedge. These techniques do not assume that foreground are Gaussian-distributed, and we additionally prove that a nal round of foreground subtraction can be performed after decorrelation", "year": 2014}, {"paperId": "b9fb152dd840b2255152c0076f02c4a2544a517d", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2052451701", "DOI": "10.1007/S11027-009-9204-7", "CorpusId": 17400894}, "title": "A little REDD model to quickly compare possible baseline and policy scenarios for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation", "abstract": "A simple model allows rapid comparison of typical baseline and policy scenarios which might be considered under international programs to avoid CO2 emissions caused by forest clearing, such as REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation).
