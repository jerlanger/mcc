Some bats change their pulse acoustics to enhance the distinction between theirs and another bat's echoes, but additional mechanisms are needed to explain the bat sonar system's exceptional resilience to jamming by conspecifics. Variable pulse repetition rate strategies offer one potential solution to this dynamic problem, but precisely how changes in pulse rate could improve sonar performance in social settings is unclear. Here we show that bats decrease their emission rates as population density increases, following a pattern that reflects a cumulative mutual suppression of each other's pulse emissions. Playback of artificially-generated echolocation pulses similarly slowed emission rates, demonstrating that suppression was mediated by hearing the pulses of other bats. Slower emission rates did not support an antiphonal emission strategy but did reduce the relative proportion of emitted pulses that overlapped with another bat's emissions, reducing the relative rate of mutual interference. The prevalence of acoustic interferences occurring amongst bats was empirically determined to be a linear function of population density and mean emission rates. Consequently as group size increased, small reductions in emission rates spread across the group partially mitigated the increase in interference rate. Drawing on lessons learned from communications networking theory we show how modest decreases in pulse emission rates can significantly increase the net information throughput of the shared acoustic space, thereby improving sonar efficiency for all individuals in a group. We propose that an automated acoustic suppression of pulse emissions triggered by bats hearing each other's emissions dynamically optimizes sonar efficiency for the entire group.", "year": 2013}, {"paperId": "c50a0456dfb2ef76d5414d04cf17c13da965a1df", "externalIds": {"PubMedCentral": "6218481", "MAG": "2898805084", "DOI": "10.1038/s41467-018-07032-0", "CorpusId": 53207677, "PubMed": "30397203"}, "title": "Copper adparticle enabled selective electrosynthesis of n-propanol", "abstract": "The electrochemical reduction of carbon monoxide is a promising approach for the renewable production of carbon-based fuels and chemicals.

We assessed differences in NH volatilization and NO emissions with broadcast application versus shallow disk injection of dairy slurry during the 2011 to 2013 growing seasons on a well-drained silt loam that received average manure-N application rates of 180 kg N ha via injection or 200 kg N ha via broadcast.

There is considerable literature on the effects of climate change on O3 but fewer studies on the effects of climate change on PM concentrations. Under the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th assessment report (AR5) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), background O3 entering Europe is expected to decrease under most scenarios due to higher water vapour concentrations in a warmer climate. However, under the extreme pathway RCP8.5 higher (more than double) methane (CH4) abundances lead to increases in background O3 that offset the O3 decrease due to climate change especially for the 2100 period. Regionally, in polluted areas with high levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx), elevated surface temperatures and humidities yield increases in surface O3 \u2013 termed the O3 climate penalty \u2013 especially in southern Europe. The O3 response is larger for metrics that represent the higher end of the O3 distribution, such as daily maximum O3. Future changes in PM concentrations due to climate change are much less certain, although several recent studies also suggest a PM climate penalty due to high temperatures and humidity and reduced precipitation in northern mid-latitude land regions in 2100.A larger number of studies have examined both future climate and emissions changes under the RCP scenarios. Under these pathways the impact of emission changes on air quality out to the 2050s will be larger than that due to climate change, because of large reductions in emissions of O3 and PM pollutant precursor emissions and the more limited climate change response itself. Climate change will also affect climate extreme events such as heatwaves. Air pollution episodes are associated with stagnation events and sometimes heat waves. Air quality during the 2003 heatwave over Europe has been examined in numerous studies and mechanisms for enhancing O3 have been identified.There are few studies on health effects associated with climate change impacts alone on air quality, but these report higher O3-related health burdens in polluted populated regions and greater PM2.5 health burdens in these emission regions. Studies that examine the combined impacts of climate change and anthropogenic emissions change under the RCP scenarios report reductions in global and European premature O3-respiratory related and PM mortalities arising from the large decreases in precursor emissions. Under RCP 8.5 the large increase in CH4 leads to global and European excess O3-respiratory related mortalities in 2100. For future health effects, besides uncertainty in future O3 and particularly PM concentrations, there is also uncertainty in risk estimates such as effect modification by temperature on pollutant-response relationships and potential future adaptation that would alter exposure risk.", "year": 2017}, {"paperId": "1cff328be18c49a2e299de02581108a79a833017", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2164695731", "DOI": "10.1002/ER.1104", "CorpusId": 97148938}, "title": "Hydrogen as burner fuel: modelling of hydrogen\u2013hydrocarbon composite fuel combustion and NOx formation in a small burner", "abstract": "The objective of this work is to investigate numerically the turbulent non\u2010premixed hydrogen (H2) and hydrogen\u2013hydrocarbon flames in a small burner.

But the formation of nitrous acid remains poorly understood: experimental studies imply that a suggested heterogeneous formation process involving NO2 is not efficient enough to explain the observed night-time build-up of HNO2 in polluted air masses. Here we describe kinetic investigations which indicate that the heterogeneous production of HNO2 from NO2 on suspended soot particles proceeds 105 to 107 times faster than on previously studied surfaces. We therefore propose that the interaction between NO2 and soot particles may account for the high concentrations of HNO2 in air masses where combustion sources contribute to air pollution by soot and NOx emissions.

Although the country is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 13% above 1990 levels by the period 2008\u20132012, by 2005, emissions were already 25.4% higher than the baseline and current projections are that this figure will rise to 37% over the period. The residential sector is estimated to contribute to approximately 24.5% of energy-related CO2 emissions. This paper estimates total emissions from residential developments in the GDA constructed between 1997 and 2006.Materials and methodsCarbon dioxide equivalent (CO2) emissions are estimated using a life cycle assessment approach over a 100-year building lifespan and employing process, input\u2013output and hybrid energy techniques. Life cycle stages include: construction, operation, transport, maintenance and demolition. The main data sources include: national population and industry census data, household travel survey data, residential energy performance surveys and national accounts. The GDA was split into four zones each encompassing development at increasing radii from Dublin\u2019s city centre, namely: city centre, suburbs, exurbs and commuter towns.ResultsPer capita CO2 life cycle emissions in the GDA were found to be approximately 50\u201355% greater in the exurbs and commuter towns than in the city centre. Of the five life cycle stages studied, operational energy requirements (predominantly space heating and hot water, but including power) contributed most significantly to emissions (68%), followed by transport (17%), construction (9%) and maintenance/renovation (6%).DiscussionOperating emissions from dwellings in the commuter town and extra-urban zones were almost twice those in the city centre both due to larger dwelling sizes and the predominance of detached and semi-detached dwellings (with large amounts of exposed walls) in the former and the prevalence of smaller apartments in the latter. Car use was most pronounced in the zones furthest from the city centre where per capita emissions were almost twice those of residents in the city centre. Despite their smaller size, the per capita construction CO2 emissions of apartments were approximately one third greater than for low-rise dwellings due to the greater energy intensity of the structure. However, this difference was more than compensated for by the significantly lower operational emissions referred to above.ConclusionsIn 2006, recurrent CO2 emissions (operational, transport and maintenance) from dwellings built in the GDA over the ten preceding years were 2,108\u00a0kt while construction-related emissions in that year were 1,325\u00a0kt giving a total contribution from the residential sector of 3,434\u00a0kt CO2/annum\u2014representing 4.9% of national emissions for that year. Had the development policy prescribed \u2018city centre\u2019-type development and transport modes, then emissions for the year 2006 would have been 2,892\u00a0kt CO2\u2014a reduction of almost 16% over the actual figure. However, in this scenario recurrent emissions would have been reduced to 1,417\u00a0kt CO2\u2014a reduction of 33% over actual levels.Recommendations and perspectivesThis study supports Irish and international governments\u2019 policies aimed at curbing CO2 emissions from the domestic sector which focus primarily on reducing operational emissions from new and existing housing through design and construction improvements. However, it demonstrates that significant reductions in operational emissions are associated with high-density residential development with modest floor areas. Furthermore, it highlights the scope for transport emissions\u2019 reductions through better spatial planning leading to reduced car travel.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "ffa3467b25d091e72ff94611a81dfccfbae48324", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1976904567", "DOI": "10.1080/00045608.2010.502434", "CorpusId": 129106716}, "title": "Climate, Carbon, and Territory: Greenhouse Gas Mitigation in Seattle, Washington", "abstract": "Hundreds of local governments in the United States have adopted greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals during the past several years, requiring critical examinations of the role of the state in climate governance and the effects of these programs on urban citizenship.

By deliberately connecting the causes and consequences of global climate change to the local community, Seattle has been able to use climate as a conceptual resource for urban environmental policy via the climatization of the urban environment. Furthermore, a key mechanism for making climate governable in Seattle is the carbonization of urban governance, where a relationship between the production of GHG emissions and specific urban activities is established through the use of GHG inventories and emissions monitoring. These practices facilitate the act of territorialization, where material natures and state institutions are coconstituted through the production of carbon territories. A key effect of these practices is that Seattle has begun to enroll its residents as a new type of carbon-relevant citizen in the regulation of global climate, while also reaffirming its ability to regulate infrastructural design, commercial activities, and community development.

Emission reductions in each of these regions will force the climate in different locations, which could have diverse impacts on regional and global climate. Here, we show that removing sulphur dioxide (SO2) emissions from any of these northern-hemisphere regions in a global composition-climate model results in significant warming across the hemisphere, regardless of the emission region. Although the temperature response to these regionally localised forcings varies considerably in magnitude depending on the emission region, it shows a preferred spatial pattern independent of the location of the forcing. Using empirical orthogonal function analysis, we show that the structure of the response is tied to existing modes of internal climate variability in the model. This has implications for assessing impacts of emission reduction policies, and our understanding of how climate responds to heterogeneous forcings.Climate modelling: aerosols from different regions drive global temperature patternsAerosol pollution from different industrialised regions produces similar, hemisphere-wide effects on climate. Matthew Kasoar and colleagues from Imperial College London, UK, used a state-of-the-art climate model to look at how sulphate aerosol pollution affects the global climate, depending on whether the pollution is emitted from North America, Europe, South Asia, or East Asia. Simulations showed that although the pollution scatters incoming sunlight mainly around the emission region, the effect this has on temperatures extends around the world, with a consistent pattern of temperature changes which were particularly strong over the Arctic, North America, and Western Siberia.

With a high amount of long carbon chain lengths fatty acid methyl esters (C20 to C22), the microalgal biodiesel used had a vastly different average carbon chain length and level of unsaturation to conventional biodiesel, which significantly influenced particle emissions. Smaller blend percentages showed a larger reduction in particle emission than blend percentages of over 20%. This was due to the formation of a significant nucleation mode for the higher blends. In addition measurements of reactive oxygen species (ROS), showed that the oxidative potential of particles emitted from the microalgal biodiesel combustion were lower than that of regular diesel. Biodiesel oxygen content was less effective in suppressing particle emissions for biodiesels containing a high amount of polyunsaturated C20-C22 fatty acid methyl esters and generated significantly increased nucleation mode particle emissions. The observed increase in nucleation mode particle emission is postulated to be caused by very low volatility, high boiling point and high density, viscosity and surface tension of the microalgal biodiesel tested here. Therefore, in order to achieve similar PM (particulate matter) emission benefits for microalgal biodiesel likewise to conventional biodiesel, fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) with high amounts of polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acids (\u2265C20) may not be desirable in microalgal biodiesel composition.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "099a64f02bbde7c1adec2fc7d720d1f2a96c2fcd", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1991964131", "DOI": "10.1002/SYN.20404", "CorpusId": 8271169, "PubMed": "17559096"}, "title": "Time\u2010course of change in [11C]carfentanil and [11C]raclopride binding potential after a nonpharmacological challenge", "abstract": "Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with appropriate radiotracers and quantification methods allows the detection of changes in endogenous neurotransmission by determine the reduction in the binding potential (BP) of receptors before and after experimental challenges.

The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America is one of the largest wetland complexes in the world, containing millions of small, shallow wetlands. The sediment pore waters of PPR wetlands contain some of the highest concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and sulfur species ever recorded in terrestrial aquatic environments. Using a suite of geochemical and microbiological analyses, we measured the impact of sedimentary carbon and sulfur transformations in these wetlands on methane fluxes to the atmosphere. This research represents the first study of coupled geochemistry and microbiology within the PPR and demonstrates how the conversion of abundant labile DOC pools into methane results in some of the highest fluxes of this greenhouse gas to the atmosphere ever reported. Abundant DOC and sulfate additionally supported some of the highest sulfate reduction rates ever measured in terrestrial aquatic environments, which we infer to account for a large fraction of carbon mineralization in this system. Methane accumulations in zones of active sulfate reduction may be due to either the transport of free methane gas from deeper locations or the co\u2010occurrence of methanogenesis and sulfate reduction. If both respiratory processes are concurrent, any competitive inhibition of methanogenesis by sulfate\u2010reducing bacteria may be lessened by the presence of large labile DOC pools that yield noncompetitive substrates such as methanol.

The development of the emissions to the year 2010 is reviewed in two scenarios: the base and the reduction scenarios.According to the base scenario, the Finnish CH4 emissions will decrease in the near future. Emissions from landfills, energy production, and transportation will decrease because of already decided and partly realized volume and technical changes in these sectors. The average reduction potential of 50%, as assumed in the reduction scenario, is considered achievable.N2O emissions, on the other hand, are expected to increase as emissions from energy production and transportation will grow due to an increasing use of fluidized bed boilers and catalytic converters in cars. The average reduction potential of 50%, as assumed in the reduction scenario, is optimistic.Anthropogenic CH4 and N2O emissions presently cause about 30% of the direct radiative forcing due to Finnish anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. This share would be even larger if the indirect impacts of CH4 were included.

The O3 pollution in Beijing showed a significant spatial distribution with strong regional contribution. The results suggested that the plume originating from Beijing urban areas greatly affected the O3 concentrations at the Dingling site, accounting for 55% of elevated O3 there, while O3 pollution in the Beijing urban areas resulted from both local emissions and those from Tianjin and the south of Hebei Province. Transport of O3 was responsible for about 70% of the regional O3 contribution to Beijing urban areas, while transport of O3 precursors accounted for the remainder.

This paper argues that cities have an important role to play in deepening the ambition of global climate targets. Cities have unique and strong influence over several policy levers \u2013 from urban planning to public transportation \u2013 that make them critical actors in reducing GHG emissions, avoiding further carbon lock-in, and decreasing the cost of future abatement. We find that urban actions could decrease global GHG emissions by 3.7 Gt CO2e in 2030, compared with a reference scenario, and by 8.0 Gt CO2e in 2050. The greatest reductions arise from deep improvements in residential building energy efficiency and from a transition to efficient public transport for personal urban mobility. Realizing the full potential of these actions would involve bold and swift action by the world\u2019s cities, and would likely need to be aided by new sources of finance and national policy support. At the same time, because few of the actions considered here are explicitly included in current national pledges, pursuit of this abatement could help raise the ambition of those pledges, or help nations deepen new commitments currently under consideration. Even greater reductions could be possible if cities were to demonstrate low-carbon lifestyles for categories of consumption not covered by this analysis, such as product purchasing and food consumption.

The main goals of HELGA are to study the characteristics of the extended dust emission, focusing on larger scales than studied in previous observations of Andromeda at an increased spatial resolution, and the obscured star formation. In this paper we present the data reduction and provide a description of the far-infrared morphology, comparing it with features seen at other wavelengths. We use high-resolution maps of the atomic hydrogen, fully covering our fields, to identify dust emission features that genuinely belong to M31, distinguishing them from emission coming from the foreground Galactic cirrus. Thanks to the very large extension of our maps we detect, for the first time at far-infrared wavelengths, three ring-shaped structures extending out to ~21, ~26 and ~31 kpc respectively, in the south-western part of M31, with the innermost structure also having a counterpart at the opposite side. The presence of these features is safely confirmed by their detection in HI maps. Due to an unfortunate coincidence of M31's systemic velocity with the rotation speed in its outermost parts, together with the presence of a bright emission from the Galactic cirrus heavily contaminating the north-eastern side, the detection of the other fainter features on this side of the galaxy is more uncertain. We find that the dust in M31 significantly extends beyond the previously mapped far-infrared emission. An annular-like segment, extending beyond the already known 15-kpc ring, is clearly detected on both sides of the galaxy, and similar annular structures are undoubtedly detected on the south-west side as well.", "year": 2011}, {"paperId": "a7937d555d1cbda8b71c371e7e3c47f548a01712", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2612780041", "DOI": "10.1021/jacs.7b01005", "CorpusId": 10417486, "PubMed": "28481091"}, "title": "Thiazolothiazole Fluorophores Exhibiting Strong Fluorescence and Viologen-Like Reversible Electrochromism.", "abstract": "The synthesis, electrochemical, and photophysical characterization of N,N'-dialkylated and N,N'-dibenzylated dipyridinium thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole derivatives are reported.

Wildfire simulation modelling was used to examine whether fuel reduction treatments can potentially reduce future wildfire emissions and provide carbon benefits. In contrast to previous reports, the current study modelled landscape scale effects of fuel treatments on fire spread and intensity, and used a probabilistic framework to quantify wildfire effects on carbon pools to account for stochastic wildfire occurrence. The study area was a 68 474 ha watershed located on the Fremont-Winema National Forest in southeastern Oregon, USA. Fuel reduction treatments were simulated on 10% of the watershed (19% of federal forestland). We simulated 30 000 wildfires with random ignition locations under both treated and untreated landscapes to estimate the change in burn probability by flame length class resulting from the treatments. Carbon loss functions were then calculated with the Forest Vegetation Simulator for each stand in the study area to quantify change in carbon as a function of flame length. We then calculated the expected change in carbon from a random ignition and wildfire as the sum of the product of the carbon loss and the burn probabilities by flame length class. The expected carbon difference between the non-treatment and treatment scenarios was then calculated to quantify the effect of fuel treatments. Overall, the results show that the carbon loss from implementing fuel reduction treatments exceeded the expected carbon benefit associated with lowered burn probabilities and reduced fire severity on the treated landscape. Thus, fuel management activities resulted in an expected net loss of carbon immediately after treatment. However, the findings represent a point in time estimate (wildfire immediately after treatments), and a temporal analysis with a probabilistic framework used here is needed to model carbon dynamics over the life cycle of the fuel treatments. Of particular importance is the long-term balance between emissions from the decay of dead trees killed by fire and carbon sequestration by forest regeneration following wildfire.", "year": 2010}, {"paperId": "6e13ea7ce4bc84b65aaf8b4240067423b3e6cacc", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2119583289", "DOI": "10.1109/ICBBE.2008.461", "CorpusId": 22930759}, "title": "Pollutant Emission Reduction Analysis of Distributed Energy Resource", "abstract": "Environment directly affects human health.

Biota are recovering in some lakes and rivers, as water quality improves, but they are not yet recovering in others. To make sense of these different responses, and to foster effective management of the acid rain problem, we need to understand 2 things: i) the sequence of ecological steps needed for biotic communities to recover; and ii) where and how to intervene in this process should recovery stall. Here our purpose is to develop conceptual frameworks to serve these 2 needs. In the first framework, the primarily ecological one, a decision tree highlights the sequence of processes necessary for ecological recovery, linking them with management tools and responses to bottlenecks in the process. These bottlenecks are inadequate water quality, an inadequate supply of colonists to permit establishment, and community-level impediments to recovery dynamics. A second, more management-oriented framework identifies where we can intervene to overcome these bottlenecks, and what research is needed to build the models to operationalize the framework.

Observations at surface sites show an increase in global mean surface methane (CH4) of about 180 parts per billion (ppb) (above 10 %) over the period 1984\u20132012. Over this period there are large fluctuations in the annual growth rate. In this work, we investigate the atmospheric CH4 evolution over the period 1970\u20132012 with the Oslo CTM3 global chemical transport model (CTM) in a bottom-up approach. We thoroughly assess data from surface measurement sites in international networks and select a subset suited for comparisons with the output from the CTM. We compare model results and observations to understand causes for both long-term trends and short-term variations. Employing Oslo CTM3 we are able to reproduce the seasonal and year-to-year variations and shifts between years with consecutive growth and stagnation, both at global and regional scales. The overall CH4 trend over the period is reproduced, but for some periods the model fails to reproduce the strength of the growth. The model overestimates the observed growth after 2006 in all regions. This seems to be explained by an overly strong increase in anthropogenic emissions in Asia, having global impact. Our findings confirm other studies questioning the timing or strength of the emission changes in Asia in the EDGAR v4.2 emission inventory over recent decades. The evolution of CH4 is not only controlled by changes in sources, but also by changes in the chemical loss in the atmosphere and soil uptake. The atmospheric CH4 lifetime is an indicator of the CH4 loss. In our simulations, the atmospheric CH4 lifetime decreases by more than 8 % from 1970 to 2012, a significant reduction of the residence time of this important greenhouse gas. Changes in CO and NOx emissions, specific humidity, and ozone column drive most of this, and we provide simple prognostic equations for the relations between those and the CH4 lifetime. The reduced lifetime results in substantial growth in the chemical CH4 loss (relative to its burden) and dampens the CH4 growth.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "1f2bb20debdeae8c45e77fba7a2254f9fc71e21a", "externalIds": {"MAG": "1717279822", "CorpusId": 109125884}, "title": "Virtual Mobility and Pollution Prevention - The Emerging Role of ICT Based Communication in Organisations and its Impact on Travel", "abstract": "Information and Communication Technologies change the way we work and communicate, enabling us to telework and to have virtual meetings - collaborating without a physical meeting.

The Substitution Provision of the SO2 emissions trading program allows the owner or operator of an affected electric utility unit to voluntarily designate a non-affected electric unit to become subject to all compliance requirements of affected units and to receive SO2 traceable emission permits (allowances). We find that although the Substitution provision has had a rather small effect on the overall of the SO2 emissions trading program and on SO2 emissions reductions, there has been a significant participation, with more than half of the \"affected\" electric utilities using this voluntary option to reduce compliance costs. This provides further evidence to the notion that, in general, electric utilities are choosing cost-effective strategies to comply with SO2 limits. Consistent with that is our finding that transaction costs associated to the Substitution provision have been relatively low. In another result, we show that non-affected units have opted in, largely because their actual unrestricted emissions (i.e. emissions in the absence of regulation) are below their historic omissions and hence their allowance allocation. Other units have opted in because they have low marginal control costs, say, below allowance prices. While the latter effect reduce today's aggregate cost of compliance by shifting reduction from high cost affected units to low cost units (the flexibility effect), the first effect increases today's emissions and emissions in the future (the adverse selection effect). An ex post cost-benefit analysis suggests that the adverse selection effect dominates, in part because of low allowance prices from an ex ante perspective however, we show that this result may not hold.

We show that damages in the agriculture sector are very high when compared to sectoral value added. This study provides a basis for further investigations on multiple fronts, such as a more detailed look at particular industries or on a smaller geographical scale. Emissions of most pollutants that result in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) formation have been decreasing in the United States. However, this trend has not been uniform across all sectors or regions of the economy. We use integrated assessment models (IAMs) to compute marginal damages for PM2.5-related emissions for each county in the contiguous United States and match location-specific emissions with these marginal damages to compute economy-wide gross external damage (GED) due to premature mortality. We note 4 key findings: First, economy-wide, GED has decreased by more than 20% from 2008 to 2014. Second, while much of the air pollution policies have focused to date on the electricity sector, damages from farms are now larger than those from utilities.

For the vehicle-level comparison, we use models to ensure that vehicle size, performance, and fuel consumption are unbiased between vehicle types and consistent with the scenarios for technological development.Results and discussionOur results show that FCVs can decrease life cycle greenhouse gas emissions by 50\u00a0% compared to gasoline ICEVs if hydrogen is produced from renewable electricity, thus exhibiting similar emission levels as BEVs that are charged with the same electricity\u00a0mix. If hydrogen is produced by natural gas reforming, FCVs are found to offer no greenhouse gas reductions, along with higher impacts in several other environmental impact categories. A major contributor to these impacts is the FCS, in particular the platinum in the catalyst and the carbon fiber in the hydrogen tank. The large amount of carbon fiber used in the tank was also the reason why we found that FCVs may not become fully cost competitive with ICEVs or BEVs, even when substantial technological development and mass production of all components is assumed.ConclusionsWe conclude that FCVs only lead to lower greenhouse gas emissions than ICEVs if their fuel is sourced from renewable energy, as is the case with BEVs. FCVs are an attractive alternative to ICEVs in terms of vehicle performance criteria such as range and refueling time.

Two weeks after the final stimulation, tinnitus had returned to baseline in all patients but one. Conclusion: Tinnitus can be attenuated by low-frequency rTMS navigated to each person\u2019s maximum tinnitus-related cortical hyperactivity.

The present study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that combined total sleep deprivation and paroxetine treatment would produce a persistent reduction in glucose metabolism in the anterior cingulate cortex similar to that reported after long-term antidepressant treatment.\n\n\nMETHOD\nSix elderly depressed patients who met the DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder and six age-matched comparison subjects underwent serial positron emission tomography (PET) studies at baseline, after total sleep deprivation, after recovery sleep (after the initial paroxetine dose), and after 2 weeks of paroxetine treatment (patients only). The PET data were analyzed by using statistical parametric mapping methods.\n\n\nRESULTS\nThe patients' scores on a 13-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were decreased after total sleep deprivation, after recovery sleep, and after 2 weeks of treatment. The Hamilton depression scores of the comparison subjects were not significantly altered. In the patients, the greatest reductions in normalized, relative glucose metabolism after sleep deprivation were observed in the anterior cingulate cortex (Brodmann area 24), and they persisted after recovery sleep and antidepressant treatment. The comparison subjects demonstrated increased metabolism in these areas.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nImprovement in the patients' depressive symptoms was accompanied by reduced glucose metabolism in the right anterior cingulate cortex and right medial frontal cortex.

The vehicles operated in Southern California and were nominally identical. Three vehicles operated \"as-is\" on California Air Resources Board (CARB) specification diesel fuel and no emission control devices. Three vehicles were retrofit with Johnson Matthey CCRT\u00ae (Catalyzed Continuously Regenerating Technology) filters and fueled with Shell GTL Fuel. Two rounds of emissions tests were conducted on a chassis dynamometer over the City Suburban Heavy Vehicle Route (CSHVR) and the New York City Bus (NYCB) cycle. The CARB-fueled vehicles served as the baseline, while the GTL-fueled vehicles were tested with and without the CCRT filters. Results from the first round of testing have been reported previously (see 2004-01-2959). The second round results were compared to the CARB specification diesel fuel baseline. Over the CSHVR cycle, the GTL Fuel (no filter) reduced oxides of nitrogen (NO x ), hydrocarbon (HC), and particulate matter (PM) emissions by 13%, 46%, and 21%, respectively, and increased carbon monoxide (CO) by 11%. The GTL Fuel and the CCRT filter virtually eliminated the HC, CO, and PM emissions and reduced NO x emissions by 22%, a statistically significant reduction. Testing over the NYCB cycle also revealed emission reductions are possible with GTL Fuel. Compared to the CARB specification diesel fuel, the GTL Fuel provided statistically significant reductions in NO x , HC, and PM emissions by 11%, 58%, and 16%, respectively. A 10% increase in CO emissions was also noted, although not statistically significant. With the CCRT filter, the HC, CO, and PM emissions were reduced by over 95%. A statistically significant NO x reduction of 20% was observed. Reductions from round 2 were notably larger than those in round 1. To determine if the changes observed between rounds were \"real\", a statistical analysis was performed. The analysis found that CO emissions were higher without the filter in round 2, while no changes were observed for HC or PM emissions. The NO x emissions were significantly higher in round 1 for the NYCB cycle only. The fleet was followed for operability for 6 months and accumulated -20,000 miles. Driver feedback for the vehicles operating on the GTL Fuel and CCRT filters was very positive.

Even in a baseline scenario, with no comprehensive international climate policy, a moderate level of CCS technology is expected to be deployed, given the economic benefits associated with enhanced oil and gas recovery. With stringent climate change control, CCS technologies will probably be installed on an industrial scale. Geologically stored CO2, however, may leak back to the atmosphere, which could render CCS ineffective as climate change reduction option. This article presents a long-term energy scenario study for Europe, in which we assess the significance for climate policy making of leakage of CO2 artificially stored in underground geological formations. A detailed sensitivity analysis is performed for the CO2 leakage rate with the bottom-up energy systems model MARKAL, enriched for this purpose with a large set of CO2 capture technologies (in the power sector, industry, and for the production of hydrogen) and storage options (among which enhanced oil and gas recovery, enhanced coal bed methane recovery, depleted fossil fuel fields, and aquifers). Through a series of model runs, we confirm that a leakage rate of 0.1%/year seems acceptable for CCS to constitute a meaningful climate change mitigation option, whereas one of 1%/year is not. CCS is essentially no option to achieve CO2 emission reductions when the leakage rate is as high as 1%/year, so more reductions need to be achieved through the use of renewables or nuclear power, or in sectors like industry and transport. We calculate that under strict climate control policy, the cumulative captured and geologically stored CO2 by 2100 in the electricity sector, when the leakage rate is 0.1%/year, amounts to about 45,000 MtCO2. Only a little over 10,000 MtCO2 cumulative power-generation-related emissions are captured and stored underground by the end of the century when the leakage rate is 1%/year. Overall marginal CO2 abatement costs increase from a few \u20ac/tCO2 today to well over 150 \u20ac/tCO2 in 2100, under an atmospheric CO2 concentration constraint of 550\u00a0ppmv. Carbon costs in 2100 turn out to be about 40 \u20ac/tCO2 higher when the annual leakage rate is 1%/year in comparison to when there is no CO2 leakage. Irrespective of whether CCS deployment is affected by gradual CO2 seepage, the annual welfare loss in Europe induced by the implementation of policies preventing \u201cdangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\u201d (under our assumption, implying a climate stabilisation target of 550\u00a0ppmv CO2 concentration) remains below 0.5% of GDP during the entire century.", "year": 2009}, {"paperId": "f435c0dd58f09d9317bef191f326bcf04d374560", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2074172803", "DOI": "10.1080/10962247.2015.1025925", "CorpusId": 205763297, "PubMed": "26079559"}, "title": "Sensor transition failure in the high flow sampler: Implications for methane emission inventories of natural gas infrastructure", "abstract": "Quantification of leaks from natural gas (NG) infrastructure is a key step in reducing emissions of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4), particularly as NG becomes a larger component of domestic energy supply. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires measurement and reporting of emissions of CH4 from NG transmission, storage, and processing facilities, and the high-flow sampler (or high-volume sampler) is one of the tools approved for this by the EPA. The Bacharach Hi-Flow Sampler (BHFS) is the only commercially available high-flow instrument, and it is also used throughout the NG supply chain for directed inspection and maintenance, emission factor development, and greenhouse gas reduction programs. Here we document failure of the BHFS to transition from a catalytic oxidation sensor used to measure low NG (~5% or less) concentrations to a thermal conductivity sensor for higher concentrations (from ~5% to 100%), resulting in underestimation of NG emission rates. Our analysis includes both our own field testing and analysis of data from two other studies (Modrak et al., 2012; City of Fort Worth, 2011). Although this failure is not completely understood, and although we do not know if all BHFS models are similarly affected, sensor transition failure has been observed under one or more of these conditions: (1) Calibration is more than ~2 weeks old; (2) firmware is out of date; or (3) the composition of the NG source is less than ~91% CH4. The extent to which this issue has affected recent emission studies is uncertain, but the analysis presented here suggests that the problem could be widespread. Furthermore, it is critical that this problem be resolved before the onset of regulations on CH4 emissions from the oil and gas industry, as the BHFS is a popular instrument for these measurements.

Experiments spanned water/fuel mass ratios up to 140mass% and exhaust gas recirculation ratios up to 20vol% for gasoline and diesel operation with different injection strategies. Diluting the combustion process with either water or EGR resulted in a significant reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions along with a reduction in brake thermal efficiency. The sensitivity of brake thermal efficiency to water and EGR varied among the fuels and injection strategies investigated. An efficiency breakdown revealed that water injection considerably reduced the wall heat transfer; however, a substantial increase in exhaust enthalpy offset the reduction in wall heat transfer and led to a reduction in brake thermal efficiency. Regular diesel operation with main and post injection exhibited a brake thermal efficiency of 45.8% and a 0.3% reduction at a water/fuel ratio of 120%. The engine operation with gasoline, early pilot, and main injection strategy showed a brake thermal efficiency of 45.0% at 0% water/fuel ratio, and a 1.2% decrease in brake thermal efficiency for a water/fuel ratio of 140%.

The study was conducted using multiple data collection techniques, including interviews, production observation, firsthand experience, and online-search summaries.ResultsInspired by a full analysis of case studies, a hierarchical conceptual framework was developed to provide an overarching view of how existing apps achieve environmental benefits, which deepens our understanding of the interrelationship between freight Apps utilization and CO2 reduction. Freight apps provide a mechanism that auto-match the consignor\u2019s demand and the carrier\u2019s supply based on mobile Internet. The efficient way to find the right truck and complete the delivery process enhances the decrease of truck\u2019s empty travel distances and improvement of average vehicle loaded, then leading to an improvement of efficiency and a decline in carbon emission in freight industry. And then the identification of returning pick-up and route planning was conducted to further improve apps for CO2 reduction.ConclusionsThe influences to freight movement system by apps focused on reconstructing the demand and supply with integration technology, and resulted in a more efficient transaction using matching technology and advanced fleet management with optimization technology. When with inter-urban Full Truck Load, freight apps enable carriers to search for demand for returning a pick-up with decreasing empty running mileages, which then has environmental benefits through reducing CO2 emissions. However, when in urban Less-than-Truck Load, by strengthening the average vehicle utilization on laden trips, another determinant of route planning of delivery & collection reduced CO2 emissions. In order to further promote development of apps, in inter-urban Full Truck Load of long-distance transport, sufficient number of users and suitable matching conditions ensured carriers schedule an order to guarantee the return pick-up at an appointed time or grab several orders to achieve a larger non-empty return trip. In this \u201calways-laden\u201d transport plan, consideration should be given to the carriers\u2019 search and waiting costs before starting the next freight service.

In this paper, these issues are examined for the period after 2030 in an existing openly-available, hourly-resolved, per-country, and highly-renewable model of the European energy system, PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30, that includes electricity, land transport, and space and water heating. A parameter sweep of different reduction targets for direct carbon dioxide emissions is performed, ranging from no target down to zero direct emissions. The composition of system investments, the interactions between the energy sectors, shadow prices, and the market values of the system components are analysed as the carbon dioxide limit changes. Electricity and land transport are defossilised first, while the reduction of emissions in space and water heating is delayed by the expense of new components and the difficulty of supplying heat during cold spells with low wind and solar power generation. For deep carbon dioxide reduction, power-to-gas changes the system dynamics by reducing curtailment and increasing the market values of wind and solar power.

Twelve rumen-cannulated lactating cows were used in a replicated 4\u00d74 Latin square design (35-d periods) with a 2\u00d72 factorial arrangement of treatments. Cows were fed (ad libitum) RCS- or CS-based diets [forage:concentrate ratio 60:40; dry matter (DM) basis] without or with LO (4% of DM). Supplementation of LO to the RCS-based diet reduced enteric CH4 production (-9%) and CH4 energy losses (-11%) with no adverse effects on DM intake, digestion, ruminal fermentation characteristics, protozoa numbers, or milk production. The addition of LO to the CS-based diet caused a greater decrease in CH4 production (-26%) and CH4 energy losses (-23%) but was associated with a reduction in DM intake, total-tract fiber digestibility, protozoa numbers, acetate:propionate ratio, and energy-corrected milk yield. Urinary N excretion (g/d) decreased with LO supplementation to RCS- and CS-based diets, suggesting reduced potential of N2O emissions. Results from this study show that the depressive effect of LO supplementation on enteric CH4 production is more pronounced with the CS- than with the RCS-based diet. However, because of reduced digestibility with the CS-based diet, the reduction in enteric CH4 production may be offset by higher CH4 emissions from manure storage. Thus, the type of forage of the basal diet should be taken into consideration when using fat supplementation as a dietary strategy to reduce enteric CH4 production from dairy cows.", "year": 2015}, {"paperId": "c4780a56338eecd1d9e88b29d2dc277a271dd536", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2801038358", "DOI": "10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2018.05.038", "CorpusId": 158255617}, "title": "The manufacturer's joint decisions of channel selections and carbon emission reductions under the cap-and-trade regulation", "abstract": null, "year": 2018}, {"paperId": "0557bec2c6d170a8541b196fe1abd15b4db98e32", "externalIds": {"MAG": "2037223354", "DOI": "10.1061/(ASCE)1076-0342(2006)12:2(121)", "CorpusId": 110274481}, "title": "Transportation choices and air pollution effects of telework", "abstract": "Telework has emerged as a possible solution to transportation-related air pollution problems.

Among others, the study found that total telework-related CO2 emissions during the cooling season and SO2, NOX, and hydrocarbon emissions in both seasons appear to be lower than nontelework emissions for all modes of transportation (except for light rail with higher NOX emissions and urban transit buses with roughly equal NOX emissions in the heating season). Light rail also has higher telework N2O and CH4 emissions. However, given the uncertainties in the data, the differences may be negligible. Urban transit buses and commuter express buses were found to be associated with more telework than nontelework CO emissions in both seasons. For these two modes, telework PM10 emissions are higher in the cooling and about the same in the heating season than nontelework emissions. Natural gas-powered ferries have more telework PM10 emissions than nontelework emissions. The study also found that for low-frequency telework programs energy use impacts could overturn transportation-related emission reductions independent of the mode of transportation used.

A Reference scenario (no CO2 constraints post-2020) was analysed to allow for comparison. The key conclusions are as follows: (a) the achievement of negative emissions in the power sector via the use of biomass with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) allows for much more limited decarbonization in the buildings and transport sectors; (b) CCS is also extensively used for decarbonization of the industrial sector; (c) because of the absence in the model of options for transport mode-switching and building fabric efficiency improvements, the transport and buildings sectors achieve relatively little abatement by 2050 \u2013 the inclusion of these options could considerably reduce the need for BECCS and the cost of abatement; (d) decarbonization of the EU\u2019s energy system by 2050 would increase energy system costs by 14% compared to a Reference scenario with no CO2 constraints; and (e) average EU-wide marginal CO2 abatement costs in Policy Success reach $300/tCO2 in 2050. Such a value is within the (wide) range of marginal carbon prices produced by comparable scenarios in other studies. Policy relevance The EU has set itself a target of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 80% by 2050, against 1990 levels. This will require a reduction of at least 80% in CO2 emissions from the energy system. This article, using results from the European TIMES Model (ETM-UCL), demonstrates that in the absence of significant decarbonization in the buildings and road transport sectors, substantial negative emissions in the power sector must be achieved, through as-yet unproven technologies (involving BECCS) . Therefore, a comprehensive strategy to reduce emissions across all energy-using sectors is required if this outcome is to be avoided.

The probe hybridizes two fluorescence nanodots (quantum dots (QDs) and carbon dots (CDs)). Although both of them can be viable fluorescence probes for metal ion detection, rarely research has coupled this two different kinds of fluorescence material in one nanosensor to fabricate a selectively ratiometric fluorescence probe for intracellular imaging. The red emitting CdTe/CdS QDs were capped around the silica microsphere to serve as the response signal label, and the blue-emitting CDs, which is insensitive to the analyte, were covalently attached to the QDs surface to act as the reference signal. This core-satellite hybrid sphere not only improves the stability and brightness of QDs significantly but also decreases the cytotoxicity toward HeLa cells tremendously. Moreover, the Cu(2+) could quench the QDs emission effectively but have no ability for reduction of the CDs emission.

All the aforementioned approaches are based on various physical and chemical phenomena including absorption, adsorption, and cryogenic capture of CO2. The purified carbon dioxide is sent for the physical storage options afterwards, using the earth as a gigantic reservoir with unknown long-term environmental impacts as well as possible hazards associated with that. Consequently, the ultimate solution for the CO2 sequestration is the chemical transformation of this stable molecule to useful products such as fuels (through, for example, Fischer\u2013Tropsch chemistry) or polymers (through successive copolymerization and chain growth). This sustainably reduces carbon emissions, taking full advantage of CO2-derived chemical commodities, so-called carbon capture and conversion. Nevertheless, the surface chemistry of CO2 reduction is a challenge due to the presence of large energy barriers, requiring noticeable catalysis. This work aims to review the most recent advances in this concept selectively (CO2 conversion to fuels and CO2 copolymerization) with chemical engineering approach in terms of both materials and process design. Some of the most promising studies are expanded in detail, concluding with the necessity of subsidizing more research on CO2 conversion technologies considering the growing global concerns on carbon management.
